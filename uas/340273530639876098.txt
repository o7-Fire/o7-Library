creations-chat 2020-04-22 22:53:54 Yes.
creations-chat 2020-04-22 22:54:10 IT's a tiny plane, not a cooler tutorial plane.
creations-chat 2020-04-22 22:54:51 i wanted it to be tiny because i spent all day working on a build none of you like anyways, i don't care if you don't like it.
the-dump 2020-04-22 23:06:26 wasn't even thinking about it until now.

creations-chat 2020-04-28 23:19:30 Nobody said you should kill yourself, you said that.
creations-chat 2020-04-28 23:19:42 Nobody thinks that either i suppose.
creations-chat 2020-04-28 23:22:39 I find it funny that FaZe_Cl4ps is the ONLY person who hated on my stinky elevator despite the name and appearance ðŸ˜†
creations-chat 2020-04-28 23:24:20 I'm all of the sudden feeling a lack of creations in the creations chat guys.
creations-chat 2020-04-28 23:25:21 -------no more talky talky line--------

creations-chat 2020-04-29 00:36:27 No need to be rude.
creations-chat 2020-04-29 00:40:18 How did the trains from thomas the tank engine reproduce?
creations-chat 2020-04-29 00:40:41 Well, how did the cars from cars reproduce?
creations-chat 2020-05-02 05:02:22 everyone works with what they got in plane crazy because sadly the part spectrum is more limited then some other building games.
creations-chat 2020-05-02 05:04:15 add a search bar and then add tons of parts, that's all i need.
creations-chat 2020-05-02 05:05:43 you can make compact vehicles that still look good a lot easier and a lot more diverse.
creations-chat 2020-05-02 19:42:02 that's sexy as hell
creations-chat 2020-05-02 19:46:41 what's a "obivous opinion"?
creations-chat 2020-05-02 19:47:39 I only vote finished builds, but it's looking okay.
creations-chat 2020-05-03 00:04:08 I still don't know what Trash Gang is, but it's sound like it's for trash people and not in a cool or edgy way as they probably intended it to be.
creations-chat 2020-05-03 00:05:58 <@!410992368494575626> What's Trash Gang?
creations-chat 2020-05-03 00:06:04 Please tell me.
creations-chat 2020-05-03 00:06:47 I'm not looking it up.
creations-chat 2020-05-03 00:07:44 Is it?
creations-chat 2020-05-03 00:08:03 I have had this question for a while.
creations-chat 2020-05-03 00:08:22 I never have looked into it.
creations-chat 2020-05-03 00:09:00 Why won't someone just give me a clear answer instead of this.
creations-chat 2020-05-03 00:14:13 You should both make an
creations-chat 2020-05-03 00:14:21 arguement and see which ones better
creations-chat 2020-05-03 00:14:32 am i right?
creations-chat 2020-05-03 01:44:48 I would suggest making alts for future storage.
creations-chat 2020-05-03 01:46:55 Shove beans down your throat, then jump off the deck of a tall boat, let your lungs fill with water until they bloat, also add an extremely stone filled coat.
creations-chat 2020-05-03 01:47:59 Make an easports game for your next build
creations-chat 2020-08-24 06:00:04 maybe it's not but for me at least, making a rocket that splits into 4 different pieces and releases a cluster of bombs look pretty is difficult to do in plane crazy, I tried.
creations-chat 2021-04-25 23:39:14 this is how far it lauches a 9x9 explosive block
creations-chat 2021-04-25 23:41:40 is there anyway i can make it launch farther, other then making it 10x bigger
creations-chat 2021-04-25 23:49:52 it was a fluke, at this point i dont know what to do because the launches tend to be inconsistant
creations-chat 2021-04-25 23:56:32 wait, if i start the launch while the beam is at a slight angle it would affect the trajectory and therefore distance, my first design to raise the beam at an angle while still being able to release the beam was a rope and disconnectors only issue is it makes the sling so shaky whatever is inside the pouch goes flying out before the launch even starts
creations-chat 2021-04-26 00:04:41 improved release now includes angle adjustment without the shake
creations-chat 2021-04-26 03:51:52 I'm working on a mech that will use ropes to move most of its parts
