help 2020-08-10 04:55:52 <@461644261566185503> sorry if you already found it out, and that this is very late, but the helium needs to be at the top for it to not roll when turning, or if it gets rammed by something. it's not gonna just gonna completely stop rolling, but it will automatically correct itself after a little while
help 2020-08-10 04:57:35 Don't know, and i can't test it because my laptop broke abt a week ago
help 2020-08-10 04:58:15 But yeah putting the helium at the top is the best option other than manual correction via rockets
