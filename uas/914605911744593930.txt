creations-chat 2022-04-13 19:25:00 hey thats not as bad acctualy
creations-chat 2022-04-13 19:27:24 use custom angles then just use some angle lock to get the nosecone in the correct length and angle
creations-chat 2022-04-13 19:33:05 still you should probably use the custom angles and stuff to make it look more accurate to the real thing nosecone could be longer just saying maby a block and a half could be good
creations-chat 2022-04-13 19:35:14 nosecone can be longer plus the canopy is off
creations-chat 2022-04-13 20:49:14 you had 1 job <@947251161373769728>  that was to make a star in a circle with lines around it and you failed <:m_:778994206948589638>

creations-chat 2022-05-02 17:18:19 ok yeah thats just blatant copying the only things different is the emoji in the headlights and the stripes on the hood QOINCIDENCE I THINK NOT you clearly knew about his mustang when you posted the build
creations-chat 2022-05-02 17:22:08 dude from the front to WING LIGHTS ON THE BUMPER if it was truly a coincident I think there would be a few more clear differences say the grill or the headlights
creations-chat 2022-05-02 17:24:26 also if it was truly a "concident" then I would expect  a tiny detail as small as the wing lights on the bumper wouldnt be there or would be different but no they are there
creations-chat 2022-05-02 17:26:25 alrigh alright if this WAS a coincident then why is the grill and headlights practically the exact same its a copy its litteraly a copy
creations-chat 2022-05-02 17:30:49 also can I mention the fact that there is also a exposed delta wing just like <@668314196764655618> mustang I dont think that would have been there if it was a "coincident" ok ok sorry

creations-chat 2022-05-15 14:41:36 also why did you place some random seats on the floats,also the elevators and tail look absolutly tiny the red is way too bright same with the white and also it has cheese grater wings and also theres a gap ontop of the cockpit and finally the red on the propeller is not the same on the wings

creations-chat 2022-05-15 17:24:33 the prop blades are already signs <@605437290520510476> and also ill make the blades 1 block less
creations-chat 2022-05-15 17:26:55 nose angle seems fine in my opinion and I will try legacy glass but if it doesnt look good ill just reverse it
creations-chat 2022-05-15 17:30:16 I made the blades 3 blocks long and also I made them legacy glass personaly I think default looks better
aight <@923332873409396747>

creations-chat 2022-05-15 17:58:02 <:what:644996672048463942> a gravity assisted propeller?

creations-chat 2022-05-15 18:10:09 oh I see I could try that but it would require some extra space that I dont think I have

also that speed stage things for the propeller has well failed the propeller just magically moves its self out of the nosecone somehow and causes the entire build to fling its self and die
creations-chat 2022-05-15 18:13:04 im sticking with 1 stage does all I tried and well still dont work

creations-chat 2022-05-31 22:34:26 nah bro its a modded tut

creations-chat 2022-05-31 22:51:02 still doesnt explain the identical nosecone or that identical cockpit
also you literally just modified it,there aint no doubt about it
creations-chat 2022-05-31 22:55:59 you could have used other peoples Su-57's as a referance yet you decided "hey let me use the shittiest looking SU-57 tutorial as a referance and then modify it and then post it to discord"
and also wOw what a coincidence that you just so happen to use the exact same fucking nosecone and cockpit design wow!
creations-chat 2022-05-31 22:59:10 <#384025409945337856> is litteraly ment for you to look at stuff and you know like use it for referance and has super good builds to use as a referance,yet this dude said fuck it and used a fucking tutorial targeted to beginners as a "referance"
creations-chat 2022-05-31 23:04:03 I doubt he that he didnt intend to copy like minor details like the cockpit or the intakes could have been different but nope thats just not how it goes

creations-chat 2022-06-01 20:31:23 this dude
creations-chat 2022-06-01 22:22:41 paintjob is bland needs a few other colours to make it less bland
maby a couple of darker greys or lighter grays on the hull and also make the railing a lighter colour
creations-chat 2022-06-01 22:25:55 why not try a camo like this
I like this camo more though just a light blue a light grey and a dark blue
creations-chat 2022-06-01 23:00:58 man now I really want to make a boat
creations-chat 2022-06-01 23:29:36 comically long propeller
creations-chat 2022-06-01 23:35:02 traonk
creations-chat 2022-06-01 23:46:53 normaly it takes me around 3 weeks to build something
creations-chat 2022-06-01 23:53:40 finally I fucking did it I made the propeller work
creations-chat 2022-06-02 01:34:40 its a BF-109 F4 trop
creations-chat 2022-06-02 01:37:28 also do you have any feedback
like decals or paint job or something
creations-chat 2022-06-02 01:41:36 yeah somebody else told me that that scoop was a little too far down but due to the way I made the propeller and shit that dont work but im planning a future solution for that
basicly currently if I tried to move the scoop thing up a bit then well it would jam the propeller and not make it work
creations-chat 2022-06-02 01:51:43 pistons in general are the bane of my existance like I have 1 piston near the propeller on my 109 that just pushes it a bit forwards but for some reason it just wont extend fully
even more confusing is that when I set a motor infront of that piston to not lock it just so happened to work
too true <@738091123590824000>
creations-chat 2022-06-02 01:55:08 too true

creations-chat 2022-06-02 14:48:57 <@723940197456281640> not a big fan of the yellow and blue on the hull try blue or orange with white
oh and last thing change the colour of the deck to a slightly more darker colour and attempt to add weathering to everything and lastly make the sail a light tan colour to look used or something
creations-chat 2022-06-02 14:57:42 <@723940197456281640> your welcome

creations-chat 2022-06-06 23:50:22 idk try a bunch of angle locked wedges
I have seen fuzzy has done something like that
its not that complex just a bunch of motors at different speeds and then a bunch of wedges
creations-chat 2022-06-07 00:10:14 the HA-1112?

creations-chat 2022-06-07 19:08:06 AH-64 flanker

A-10 galaxy
creations-chat 2022-06-09 01:52:35 iv been there too many times to count
HK-417? oh yeah yeah they did
they also nerfed that weird 45. acp ammo
you know the one with the giant ass drum magazine and way too much damage and RPM to be legal
I didnt really use the fals anyway
creations-chat 2022-06-09 01:55:28 yeah it was pretty cool
hey at least now it has a pretty cool reload animation
oh yeah hte MG36 I guess its better then the G36 now sense that got nerfed into the abis
stylis why
like the entire point of the G36 is that it 4 shot all ranges
and now it doesnt do that anymore
creations-chat 2022-06-09 01:58:26 the G36 now is just a mid gun average RPM average damage average recoil
the entire point of it was it 4 shot all ranges
creations-chat 2022-06-09 02:12:58 oh yeah forgot the type 20 exists now
default Aug A3 doesnt 3 shot if I remeber but I belive thats with the 300 blackout
also I agree Type 20 is mid
I saw someone using a Type 20 earlier with just a red lazer
nothing else just a red lazer
creations-chat 2022-06-09 02:16:19 oh yeah also what do you think of the new PP-2000 and ASMI
personaly I think it brings a entirely different feel to the entire game
now a person can use a NTW-20 primary and also have a glock stuffed into a MP7 looking this
also yeah scorpion is still pretty good
creations-chat 2022-06-09 02:19:05 I haven't really used the OTS much but from what I heard its not the best
at least it has that 36 cqc damage and 200 something reserve
other then that its not the best
creations-chat 2022-06-09 17:20:58 I can barely understand what you said the only thing I understood was "his version is more complex and detailed" which its not
creations-chat 2022-06-09 23:36:46 hes 100 trolling like he even has creations black list <:empty:794431705070174238>

creations-chat 2022-06-10 22:27:45 ohhh yeah that shit
creations-chat 2022-06-10 23:38:07 the first one
creations-chat 2022-06-10 23:45:00 3 block wide <:what:644996672048463942>
creations-chat 2022-06-10 23:47:48 3 block wide is too big for a F-18 in my opinion 
should be 2 blocks wide

also happy early bday <@603974932585644043>
creations-chat 2022-06-11 00:04:37 number 1
creations-chat 2022-06-11 00:24:12 here you go
creations-chat 2022-06-11 13:28:24 yo thats actually pretty cool all it needs is a better camo then just green and then its good
how about a forest camo
wait I just realized it doesnt have a rear overhang
add the overhang
creations-chat 2022-06-11 15:19:05 what is it?
cool
creations-chat 2022-06-11 15:21:39 ok so the nosecone might need to be a bit longer
and also you need that frame in the middle of the cockpit
creations-chat 2022-06-11 15:24:18 aight
creations-chat 2022-06-11 17:25:02 <@664538133114912783> your "YF-23" resembles more like a brick then a YF-23

creations-chat 2022-06-11 17:31:15 omng is thaz rosclae!
I dont think you even need all that motor lock
creations-chat 2022-06-11 17:35:23 alot of that motor lock is fairly useless <:m_:778994206948589638>
ok look so the main wings can just be dragged up with 1 or 2 motors 
you dont need the Eifel tower to do that 
stabs dont even angle so you dont even need motorlock for that
creations-chat 2022-06-11 17:38:05 ok look so the main wings can just be dragged up with 1 or 2 motors 
you dont need the Eifel tower to do that 
stabs dont even angle so you dont even need motorlock for that 
the propellers I can see why you need motorlock for that but thats about where it ends
oh yeah also that spine doesnt even angle too so whats the point

creations-chat 2022-06-12 00:05:03 109 F4 trop
creations-chat 2022-06-12 00:09:18 aight thanks
creations-chat 2022-06-12 00:59:42 ok done 2 out of the 3 things said (the bottom intake was already down 3 studs)
still working on that third thing
creations-chat 2022-06-12 01:04:21 still looks comically tall
creations-chat 2022-06-12 01:48:32 <@410455661814480896> I took your advice for the exhaust thing does this look better or worse?
creations-chat 2022-06-12 01:51:58 and also the intake was already around 0.3 lower
creations-chat 2022-06-12 13:22:21 the camo looks blocky smoothen it out with wedges
the afterburners should be a gradual fade
and the nosecone looks goofy ahh
use delta wing panels
creations-chat 2022-06-12 13:30:41 
creations-chat 2022-06-12 13:42:59 wait can you just send me a side and top pic to check if your angles are correct
wait you already gave a top pic
ok
creations-chat 2022-06-12 13:45:37 yeah your right it does match up
creations-chat 2022-06-12 13:47:42 everything is near perfect accept for the wings and elevators which are a bit different other then that its pretty accurate
<:OkayChamp:709084018485887096>
I just realised I screwed up the rotation its not centered
creations-chat 2022-06-12 13:50:04 doesnt really need to change everything is pretty accurate
creations-chat 2022-06-12 13:56:48 also add canopy frames using smoke pipes
thats my last piece of feedback
creations-chat 2022-06-12 13:58:59 oh ok
creations-chat 2022-06-12 16:05:24 it lacks alot of detail like door handels or a door frame no real interior and the fade is not smooth
forgot to mention it has no rims
also the light bar look goofy ahhh you could have done half wedges with some smoke pipes or half circles
hood is fard its just a square of half blocks painted pitch black
try adding a engine there instead
creations-chat 2022-06-12 16:09:45 it lacks alot of detail like the sponsers
creations-chat 2022-06-12 16:26:20 fr

creations-chat 2022-06-13 13:32:34 the nosecone is a propeller attached to the fuselage and the way they made the sides looks like its sharper then paper

parts of the wings are not even painted üíÄ

and also not to mention theres exposed motorlock in the nosecone

and the rear elevators and stab is comically small
creations-chat 2022-06-13 13:35:35 oh god the other fuselage of the P82 isn't even the same as the other one side is thicker then the other
creations-chat 2022-06-13 13:48:59 <@506106048642285569> add weathering so it looks used 
and make the tan around the exhausts darker
and also add a fade to the exhaust bottom = light higher up = darker
creations-chat 2022-06-13 17:41:58 <@568818354060787743> your 747 looks like a hotdog spray painted blue then added one of those wish.com rc plane things cockpit and nosecone on it
and also theres no windows on the fusalage and no KLM markings on the fusalage either
creations-chat 2022-06-13 17:52:07 text signs
also the line seperating the blue front the white is not black its a dark blue
engines should be farther away from the fusalage
and last your missing the wing tips
creations-chat 2022-06-13 17:55:55 also you have what I think is just "KLM" on the tail no "Cargo" marking in grey
add that please
also the spine is too short make that longer 
last it needs the window frames in the cockpit

oh <@466793357318815744>
creations-chat 2022-06-14 02:22:31 fusalage cockpit and nosecone looks vaguely like a P-61 black widow
acctualy nevermind looks nothing like a P-61
creations-chat 2022-06-14 02:25:51 I think they tried to make a P-61 from memory then failed terribly
creations-chat 2022-06-14 15:11:38 <@738091123590824000> the viper canopy is off
creations-chat 2022-06-14 15:15:25 the canopy is just too short it needs to be a block higher
creations-chat 2022-06-14 16:17:16 everyone uses those skids even I did on a old AH-1 I had
litteraly everyone
I dont even think theres any other ways to make the skids
creations-chat 2022-06-14 16:22:43 <@750066581874147389> what is this Pinocchio looking thing üíÄ
creations-chat 2022-06-14 16:27:51 these are what carrier based ww2 fighters look like not a long tube with wings
sure these are long but not to the extent yours is the wings are also pushed forwards alot more
and also yours is grey not blue like every other navy fighter
creations-chat 2022-06-14 16:30:43 also most carrier fighters have rounded wings not those weird delta wings
true <@923332873409396747>
creations-chat 2022-06-14 16:39:10 I just realised it has intakes like a F4 phantom üíÄ
and also why is there a random red block at the rear
and those wings resemble nothing like a "carrier based ww2 fighter"
when was the last time you saw a dark grey tube with a propeller just glued to the front 
with intakes on the sides of the fuselage AND delta wings that belong on modern fighters
creations-chat 2022-06-14 16:46:57 <@664538133114912783> 
things wrong with your "Carrier based WW2 fighter"

1. the paintjob is too dark to be on any navy fighter of the time
2. propeller looks glued on to the front 
3.the intakes are not ment to be on the sides of the fuselage when was the last time you saw a ww2 fighter with intakes on the sides
4. wings resemble that of a modern fighter more then a ww2 fighter 
5. wings are too far back move the main wings further up
6.random red block
7.exposed motorlock
8.that cockpit again resembles more of a modern fighter then a WW2 fighter
9.did I ask about how it flies
creations-chat 2022-06-14 16:51:22 <@664538133114912783> show it in build mode
creations-chat 2022-06-14 16:54:12 my neck hurts already
creations-chat 2022-06-14 16:57:59 why is the motorlock sticking out from the bottom you could have just placed a half block there then build the motorlock tower above
and also whats the point of that 1 explosive block theres no others in the fuselage so all your going to do is blow up the tail
creations-chat 2022-06-14 17:04:01 ok but wheres the bombs then
creations-chat 2022-06-14 17:34:33 your carrier ww2 fighter resembles nothing like a carrier ww2 fighter
doesnt matter if its custom if I looked at that I would still think its not a ww2 carrier fighter
creations-chat 2022-06-14 17:38:49 also earlier in dms he said this 
its not even a bloody ww2 fighter 
iv been lied and decived
creations-chat 2022-06-14 17:42:25 you said earlier "technically its a joke" and now your saying "technically yes" what do you mean by technically

creations-chat 2022-06-15 23:06:03 mb
creations-chat 2022-06-15 23:21:59 stuka?
the machine gun is a horn with 2 trails on it
also add canopy frames with ladders or something idk
fix that gap too
creations-chat 2022-06-15 23:31:42 feedback for your cheese grater stuka 
make the propeller 3 bladed or 4 
make the rope angled instead of going up at a 90 degree angle then going back at a 90 degree make it 1 long continues line 
try to hide the exposed motorlock by making it 2 blocks wide or something 
fix gaps in the tail and cockpit
add window frames using ladders
also if possible do a forest camo with a brighter and darker green not just the plain dark green I have seen on alot of other stukas
creations-chat 2022-06-15 23:35:54 thanks
creations-chat 2022-06-15 23:38:55 also why is it red
creations-chat 2022-06-15 23:44:33 ok
creations-chat 2022-06-15 23:57:22 eh guess the cockpit is better but move the seat down
also add window frames
creations-chat 2022-06-15 23:59:57 dont use piston lock maby
ok then use piston lock to move it to the other direction
creations-chat 2022-06-16 00:24:18 good suggestion
creations-chat 2022-06-16 00:27:32 that made it worse acctualy try trails instead
creations-chat 2022-06-16 00:31:59 also if you are wondering if trail canopy's exist they do accept they are not called trail canopy's there called hell
1 block wide stukas are not the way to go
creations-chat 2022-06-16 00:34:55 1 block wide stukas are not the way to go
do 2 block wide
1 block in the middle 2 half blocks on the side
creations-chat 2022-06-16 00:38:09 you can also try making it 1.5 blocks wide with some piston lock
creations-chat 2022-06-16 01:23:35 just make it 2 blocks wide <:empty:794431705070174238>
it will look better and you wont have exploded motors
creations-chat 2022-06-16 01:27:19 are you sure those wings are going to cover that motorlock fully?
creations-chat 2022-06-16 01:30:35 alright then

creations-chat 2022-06-20 16:32:14 https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/504436696021204992/988480482419294218 read
also the front part of the wing thing should be much wider + angled
creations-chat 2022-06-20 16:35:48 ok <:trollface:775024642104229898>
creations-chat 2022-06-20 16:38:00 <@668314196764655618> <:trollface:775024642104229898>

angle lock NOW
creations-chat 2022-06-20 16:41:07 camo cockpit and the swashplate of the rotor are basicly identical from what I can see
same with the tail I think

if a person copys a minor detail then plays it off as there own 99% of the time they copied
for example that one guy that copied 2ypes mustang something about it having basicly identical gril and headlights along with coincidently having 2 winglights which are barely noticable
creations-chat 2022-06-20 16:46:46 yep 100% copied
creations-chat 2022-06-20 17:06:27 <@781206492187590656> it looks good but the exposed motorlock makes me want to die please fix
creations-chat 2022-06-20 17:17:26 like my BF-109 <:trollface:775024642104229898>

creations-chat 2022-06-20 17:43:09 acctualy not that bad but the paintjob makes it impossible to see shit

creations-chat 2022-06-20 17:46:40 not a bad model reminds me of one of those old roblox models made from just cylinders though
creations-chat 2022-06-20 19:12:54 hi GammaRad
creations-chat 2022-06-20 23:39:04 aint no way thats 1.1k

creations-chat 2022-06-20 23:41:22 you 100% used normal blocks instead of beams
only explanation
creations-chat 2022-06-20 23:44:50 the j

your kidding me right
the entire flight control system
is 2 fucking suspension and a few ropes
creations-chat 2022-06-20 23:48:20 your joking right aint no way that tiny little flight control equals your heli being 1.1k blocks

I counted 21 blocks total
creations-chat 2022-06-20 23:52:18 its 21 blocks
I counted it and fact checked it with scientists
they have all confirmed one thing
its that thy is not sharp witted
creations-chat 2022-06-20 23:54:44 eyy I was right he did use blocks instead of beams
creations-chat 2022-06-20 23:58:45 the meatlball looks more like a giant cookie

creations-chat 2022-06-21 00:05:15 you copied a red line near the enterances that was so miniscule
yet you still added that
creations-chat 2022-06-21 00:08:18 you basicly just indirectly said "yeah I copied it but I tried to make it different"

other then that great build
creations-chat 2022-06-23 14:23:50 forgot to mention but the tail looks too thick it needs more angle

creations-chat 2022-08-03 14:05:19 the sidewalk thing needs a bit more detail replace the slate on the sidewalk to plastic then randomly place a few 0.9 blocks to make some texture and to make it seem like theres tiles

creations-chat 2022-08-03 14:07:45 change the colours a bit to make them either lighter or darker

creations-chat 2022-08-03 14:10:48 thats what I was saying
creations-chat 2022-08-03 14:16:21 <@547118086701187072> looks ok design wize but the colours are too vibrant dull them down a bit and its better
creations-chat 2022-08-03 14:22:17 the blue is too vibrant the black needs to be slightly brighter and the silver needs to be like 10 digits darker
and the grey is too light it needs to be darker

creations-chat 2022-08-03 14:57:31 those people are probably still learning what the standards are and learning how to make stuff look good

creations-chat 2022-08-19 22:52:29 why did he get 2 warns though
thats my question
this is a clear sign of the automoderation failing to warn people properly 
they gave my guy double 2 WARNS for the same incident at the same time which is incorrect 
he should have only gotten 1 mear warning 
this is a sign for us to protest and bring back double <:trollface:775024642104229898>
creations-chat 2022-08-19 23:14:32 no fucking clue
<@654091171433283637> he got unfairly banned for "toxicity" durring a incident with a whitename shit face he told double to leave the server countless times in response double was toxic back to the whinny child
and so the automoderation gave him and the child a warning how ever the automoderation UNJUSTLY 
gave him a second warn for toxicity once again if the automoderation hadnt gave double the other warn double could have been here with us to this day but sadly due to 1 flaw in the automoderation system he is gone
creations-chat 2022-08-19 23:17:25 tl:dr basicly double got warned for argueing with a child and accidently got 2 warns instead 
<:clueless:942802644043464734>

man I dont know theres no chats from the arguement
the shitter probably went to doubles dms then got cold feet and whinned do the mods

creations-chat 2023-03-27 20:29:13 not to mention expert architect is basically the most lazy ass rank to get

<@726032176340009052> at least hes got something going for him in the back + better builds than you AND hes not even fucking played in a year

grammar hippie kindergarten british person I dont really know much about horrich other then hes somewhere in the middle east
a fatass canadian being me who only built 1 build ever and thinks hes the one
another egocentric fatass who meat rides
and stick I dont even know
creations-chat 2023-03-27 20:33:30 right lets get a round up again 
fatass canadian 
sticknub
the british one 
egocentric jackass 
egocentric jackass 2 who meatrides 
horrich 
the eighth monkey

<@726032176340009052> aight you might not believe this but
its jeff and all the other contest winnermabobers
creations-chat 2023-03-27 20:36:00 yo aight I got his number dw lads
yo he said he could do one in the studio down if we give him a bill
anybody with 100$

<@726032176340009052> so theres this thing called vip lounge only people with contest winner can access
jeff has contest winner
jeff can dictate
jeff is our new dictator
all hail jeff
creations-chat 2023-03-27 20:39:24 <@726032176340009052> to sum it all up anybody with contest winner gets to dictate if a build goes into hof that includes jeff and sticknub because they have contest winner

creations-chat 2023-03-27 20:41:58 can you even do better

hol up lads just a qwick recap 
so mf harry styles wannabe thinks that EsKes shit ass thingamabob is better than jeffs other thingamabob (better)
harry potter then posts a shit ass build
EsKe defends a random nobody Harry Houdini
creations-chat 2023-03-27 20:44:15 right lads hear me out if I was to crop out the name didnt tell you who made these two builds would you say that they are built by the same person or are of similar effort
creations-chat 2023-03-27 20:47:21 custom does not equal better 
just because its custom does not make up for ass designs
custom just means you get to ass around with making your thingamabob anyway you want
non custom you get a stricter guide

for a run of a mill build like my 109 I had to go in for ages rechecking if it matches perfectly to overlays
creations-chat 2023-03-27 20:50:45 at least it looks good
thats not even the right one you ass hat

this ass little 110 took me 4 days its only at 800 some blocks
I cant even finish it because it has too many pistons
for reference if im correct 40 is around where it starts to get laggy

<@567763933952475157> do the thingamabob and send your actual builds now
creations-chat 2023-03-27 20:58:13 I used to have a T430s and I suffered using it through the ENTIRE MAKING OF MY 109
