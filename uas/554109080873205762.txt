plane-crazy 2020-06-30 02:16:26 Like the gamepass?
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 02:15:38 What do you mean?
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 01:15:33 Maybe you should add some wings in the back, that should help. Like mini ones
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 01:12:39 Epic
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 01:10:12 The center of gravity has to be in the same spot as the lift
plane-crazy 2020-06-28 15:52:13 When you click play your always taken to the non pvp server
plane-crazy 2020-06-28 15:51:42 The pvp server is completely a different server than the non pvp server
plane-crazy 2020-06-28 13:59:18 Dang, people are building complex large things while I am building my goofy smal bois
plane-crazy 2020-06-28 13:55:33 Nice avatar and plane

plane-crazy 2020-06-28 13:42:34 **ASCEND**
plane-crazy 2020-06-28 03:26:03 Yes. It's better then I have made, so yes.
plane-crazy 2020-06-28 03:04:31 Man. We need an half inner wedge
plane-crazy 2020-06-26 17:12:13 Yeah, Robotic shark.
plane-crazy 2020-06-24 15:35:38 Im pretty sure you can't affect yourself.
plane-crazy 2020-06-24 15:28:32 Build one dude
plane-crazy 2020-06-24 01:24:17 That might help
plane-crazy 2020-06-24 01:24:09 Try adjusting damping
plane-crazy 2020-06-24 01:14:08 Epic
plane-crazy 2020-06-24 01:13:52 I mean, at least they are slower than shredders
plane-crazy 2020-06-24 01:12:32 Yeah I think that's about right
plane-crazy 2020-06-23 00:43:46 Lol, that'll make people back away
plane-crazy 2020-06-23 00:40:14 I can already imagination what that does
plane-crazy 2020-06-23 00:39:57 Oh no... That would for sure do it
plane-crazy 2020-06-23 00:39:31 Nice
plane-crazy 2020-06-23 00:38:25 That's pretty cool
plane-crazy 2020-06-23 00:30:22 > Make a anchored block with a motor on top with unpowered, then put a normal block on top, then add 2 suspension at max length and max stiffness and put normal blocks on the end of those. On the normal blocks put 2 in one direction and 2 in the opposite direction for the other, then put super rocket engines on the back and add lava spitters on the 2 blocks to make a force field
<@607098626153644032> Sounds cool and all... But can we see a picture next time? It'll save us all trouble. <#384025409945337856>
plane-crazy 2020-06-22 21:57:40 Yes. I'm real scared...
plane-crazy 2020-06-22 21:50:42 If you're making a jagged one, yes. If your making a round one, no.
plane-crazy 2020-06-22 21:16:58 It's not surprising, tanks are slow
plane-crazy 2020-06-22 17:51:53 I bet he didn't
