creations-chat 2020-06-22 17:55:40 I guess it's because you have to build things to get ranks
bug-reports 2020-06-22 21:30:59 Sad.
the-dump 2020-06-22 21:51:34 Why?
bug-reports 2020-06-22 22:35:26 Nah, your heli is one that bends space time. That's normal

the-dump 2020-06-23 16:16:38 Oh no
help 2020-06-23 19:19:46 Sounds like your vehicle's suspension needs tweaking. I recommend changing the damping if you haven't already

the-dump 2020-06-28 13:29:36 Why is there a W axis? That doesn't make sense
the-dump 2020-06-28 13:37:29 And why did X, Y, and Z swap places?
the-dump 2020-06-28 13:37:37 <:NotFunny:602000308154925057>
the-dump 2020-06-28 13:38:47 Z is the up and down axis
bug-reports 2020-06-28 13:41:00 Well, motor 2 does need tweaking
the-dump 2020-06-28 13:48:04 Who even uses light mode?
the-dump 2020-06-28 13:50:45 
the-dump 2020-06-28 13:51:35 Ew why you use light?
the-dump 2020-06-28 13:52:09 Yes, I know.

creations-chat 2020-09-06 00:52:26 Wth? That's just insanity in it's purest form
creations-chat 2020-09-06 00:54:07 That sounds like some weird challenge
the-dump 2020-09-06 11:25:54 If only Nasa knew
help 2020-09-06 16:39:54 Sounds like janky Roblox physics to me
help 2020-09-06 16:40:21 And also I've seen people having those problems for some reason
help 2020-09-06 16:44:14 Well, I don't particularly know. But if you look at <#498473314445033472>, a lot of them are reporting moter 2 for being buggy
help 2020-09-06 16:45:57 Well, you can limit its motion
help 2020-09-06 16:46:22 And I don't think it has to follow your mouse
help 2020-09-06 16:47:17 Sorry what?
help 2020-09-06 16:49:05 I've heard one that too
help 2020-09-06 16:49:18 Yeah
help 2020-09-06 16:50:10 I don't think so, I feel like this might be Roblox's fault in some way
help 2020-09-06 16:51:45 Well maybe they messed up something in the code? They gotta soft code the game so we don't have these issues
help 2020-09-06 16:53:17 Well, we'll see if it goes away sometime soon
the-dump 2020-10-01 03:57:24 What the
the-dump 2020-10-01 03:57:32 Frick?
bug-reports 2020-12-17 02:54:33 I am unable to get the snow blaster because the red button is not opening. (I am on mobile, results might be different on computer)
bug-reports 2020-12-17 02:59:05 Yeah, it's not working. Are you on mobile?
bug-reports 2020-12-17 02:59:44 Yep, that's probably why. I have the same problem.
bug-reports 2020-12-17 03:00:03 So it's not a one time occurrence
bug-reports 2020-12-17 03:00:13 Good to know.
