help 2022-09-27 23:42:02 i meant like on the wheel well
help 2022-09-27 23:42:13 looks a tiny bit choppy but the front is pretty good

help 2022-10-01 19:37:32 wait do you use motor or motor2 for control surfaces
bit confused on what does what
help 2022-10-01 19:43:47 hmm
help 2022-10-01 19:44:09 guessing motor2 is better for fighter jets then
help 2022-10-01 19:44:31 true true
help 2022-10-01 19:44:44 and i guess the max angle thing is useful

creations-chat 2022-10-04 06:30:24 i‚Äôm not sure how long the 90 is at this point
creations-chat 2022-10-04 13:54:06 that‚Äôs why i said it was mediocre
creations-chat 2022-10-04 13:56:09 real (i don‚Äôt get this games scaling)
creations-chat 2022-10-04 14:01:39 <@728020153920520213> md90 probably is one of the most confusing variants of the dc9 it looks short at angles but also ridiculously long

also half the diagrams suck on it lol
creations-chat 2022-10-04 14:03:43 yeah i can tell

was it a mistake making a huge cross section to begin with?
creations-chat 2022-10-04 14:07:46 also i think my diagram sucked i used the same on to make this and it looks fine here in this game but oh my god it looks so short on the top
creations-chat 2022-10-04 14:10:03 lol
creations-chat 2022-10-04 14:12:09 minecraft is super easy cause it‚Äôs just a 1x1 grid this has a bit more

<@728020153920520213> i don‚Äôt really KNOW how long a part refers to in like a reference  like feet
also if you didn‚Äôt notice there the wing is def too close the the nose/ it‚Äôs too short
