help 2023-07-12 19:34:02 trying to build a mech and god trying to do joints is so hard

I am new to this game though, but this really is difficult
help 2023-07-12 19:36:23 gotcha, thanks ðŸ«¡
I do have trouble with making the knees work though, I think that's the main hurdle I have to jump through
help 2023-07-16 06:11:48 took me a while but god, was it fun to make
help 2023-07-16 06:12:05 I still need to try to give it the ability to fly though
