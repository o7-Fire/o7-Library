my plane is sci-fi tho so idk about yours

help 2022-07-02 04:08:27 it's just.. torque lol https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torque
help 2022-07-02 04:08:39 it's the force the motor can output
help 2022-07-02 04:09:43 if you have a lower torque the motor can support less rotational weight
help 2022-07-02 04:10:13 so if the torque is 0 you can't move the motor as it doesn't have the power to spin itself
help 2022-07-02 04:10:37 a 1000 torque motor can carry more than a 100 torque motor

creations-chat 2022-07-02 18:28:07 Most of the people in this server are super elitist and if your build isn't master-level they'll downvote you. Don't think it makes your build bad, as it really doesn't.
creations-chat 2022-07-02 18:30:19 Same! Again, the guys in this server expect everyone to be just as good as them and thereforeusually  downvote builds that aren't super complex. Still a super cool buildüòÑ

creations-chat 2022-07-02 19:21:05 Okay, I guess? You guys are being assholes. Not everybody's build is good, I admit that. But you don't need to be such a bitch about it when people's builds don't match your taste. You guys have 0 self-awareness.
help 2022-07-02 19:21:54 damn bro what is UP with you
help 2022-07-02 19:22:12 did someone in your family die or something?
help 2022-07-02 19:22:22 Why are you being so hateful to everyone?
creations-chat 2022-07-02 19:24:53 Yes. You're entitled to your opinion. But do you not understand how you are hurting people's feelings when you tell them to "delete it" or that their plane is "dogshit?" Do you lack the awareness to see how you are hurting others? Or do you find joy in seeing other people being put down? I really think you need to reevaluate your priorities, man. Remember that there's a real person behind the screen.
creations-chat 2022-07-02 19:27:32 I don't like to see you ridicule people after they ask for advice. All I'm asking you is to stop being such a wad  of shit.

"Fragile" imagine if every time you showed your parents something you were proud of they told you it was dogshit. You'd be crying, bro
creations-chat 2022-07-02 19:29:39 I know that my plane is bad. Lol. News flash, I don't give a fuck
creations-chat 2022-07-02 19:31:41 Because of the people that do care. I couldn't care less if you dislike my plane. But other people are going to take it to heart.
creations-chat 2022-07-02 19:34:47 are you stupid? don't you get that the text means something? Text on here should be just as civil as a discussion in real life.

edit: forgot you're illiterate and don't understand how text translates to words and feelings
creations-chat 2022-07-02 19:36:50 <@937433542449856533> took it seriously. He seemed quite sad after all the feedback was just telling him how "awful" it was. Please, understand that someone else is reading these and interpreting them as you're saying them.
creations-chat 2022-07-02 19:39:03 As I said. The text means something. You shouldn't be saying it to them online if you wouldn't say it to their face. So please dude, be considerate of others.
creations-chat 2022-07-02 19:42:35 "jokes" as if calling someone's creating they're proud of shit is a "joke."
If that's your idea of a joke you need a serious personality overhaul.

A "Hey check out this thing i spend 4 hours on!"
B "hey i hate it its dogshit get it out of my face idiot dumbass"
B "ugh he didnt understand my joke"
creations-chat 2022-07-02 19:45:16 I think the person who needs to "control their emotions" here is the one telling COMPLETE STRANGERS that they should be ashamed of themselves because they tried to show you something they were proud of.
creations-chat 2022-07-02 19:47:22 then why did you interject on the conversation when you had no idea of the context?? That's like seeing a fight and just joining one guy based on what color shirt he's wearing. If you're going to defend them then you should understand what they're defending
creations-chat 2022-07-02 19:49:48 Yes, I started the argument. Because I don't think it's acceptable to verbally abuse people that are trying to show you something they are proud of.
creations-chat 2022-07-02 19:52:51 Why shouldn't they?
creations-chat 2022-07-02 19:56:20 omg guys this guy doesn't like seeing people being verbally abused what a loser amirite ahahahaha time to go make fun of a new player
creations-chat 2022-07-02 19:58:39 For the millionth time, this isn't about me. I literally could not care less if you don't like my build. But other players do care. So please, try to understand their perspective and stop being so hateful.
creations-chat 2022-07-02 20:00:58 alright, let me ask. Why am I the bad guy here? Please, tell me why I'm the antagonist in this argument. Because to me, it seems like you bunch are being hateful for literally no reason.
creations-chat 2022-07-02 20:04:25 that's not a valid point. Please tell me, based on my opinions and statements here, why I'm the bad guy. All you guys have said is "you started it" and that this happens all the time. Are you forfeiting that you are in the wrong here? Do you really believe you're the good guys when you insult and verbally abuse players who's only intention is to share something they were proud of? That doesn't sound like a very kind thing to do, does it?

And <@685909594932773033> I don't really want to argue with you, I can see your point.
creations-chat 2022-07-02 20:06:27 I don't really care if I'm changing anyone's mind at this point. But why do you guys try to defend this behaviour? Is it really acceptable to you?
creations-chat 2022-07-02 20:08:30 lol you guys really have 0 counter-arguments, don't you? I think you realize that this is bad but don't want to admit you were wrong. I won't laugh at you for recognizing your faults.
creations-chat 2022-07-02 20:10:34 I thought I already was
creations-chat 2022-07-02 20:12:42 aight so basically-
some other guys have been calling people's things in <#384025409945337856> "shit" and telling them to "delete them"
and that's a pretty shitty thing to do imo
but these dudes are tryna defend it now for some reason (not really <@685909594932773033> though he's making good points and sorta playing both sides if im being honest)
creations-chat 2022-07-02 20:15:44 I'm a narcissist for trying to get you guys to not verbally abuse new players? okay i guess but that sounds rather hypocritical to me
creations-chat 2022-07-02 20:18:41 am i just supposed to sit there and watch them call a new player, who was proud of his build, a loser, dogshit and telling him to delete it? I should just sit there and watch?
creations-chat 2022-07-02 20:21:32 yall can just admit you were wrong in name-calling players who didn't do anything to you
creations-chat 2022-07-02 20:23:38 damn you three have literally 0 compassion alright

-the bomb storage area, where should it be located on the plane


If it's on the top they'll slide through the fuselage, it's purely cosmetic
creations-chat 2022-07-03 23:33:47 yeah that's the only word I found for it at the time

sorry that english isnt my first language I guess??



JazzMuse- yes, that was the intention. I don't care if you think it looks stupid, I'm asking for input on where it should be
creations-chat 2022-07-03 23:35:56 Yes, I know. this isn't going to be a conventional plane, it's mean to be sci-fi styled
creations-chat 2022-07-03 23:38:24 Bro I said it before I literally could not care less if you think it looks dumb, I want to make it anyways

creations-chat 2022-07-04 01:45:05 I'm tired of hearing "delete it" every single time I ask for advice, ok? I am trying to improve. But telling me to go fuck myself is not going to help.

I was asking what you meant, not insulting you
creations-chat 2022-07-04 02:15:59 I'm still curious to the answer of the question, though. <@793132196810588200> ?

the-dump 2022-07-04 17:44:59 ???
the-dump 2022-07-04 17:45:21 it's the community that makes it bad imo

the-dump 2022-07-04 18:01:48 nobody actually identifies to it
the-dump 2022-07-04 18:02:08 probably 4chan trolls trying to make LGBTQ+ look bad again

help 2022-07-04 18:12:20 yeahz but you can control the speed on hover engines
help 2022-07-04 18:13:28 yeah thats what I'm saying is the problem with conv
help 2022-07-04 18:13:37 I like being able to fly slow as well
help 2022-07-04 18:13:49 just my preference tho
creations-chat 2022-07-04 18:32:56 k what should I do instead then? It's more futuristic-themed, so I'd try to keep away from propellors if possible


Also- put windows on the side
creations-chat 2022-07-04 18:38:39 yeah but they need to actually propel the plane lol, they'd have to be rather big
creations-chat 2022-07-04 18:48:10 I think some people may be mad at how you can't actually see the tank (The whole video is in first-person, so you can't actually tell what it looks like)

also color the rockets so they match the color scheme
creations-chat 2022-07-04 18:58:13 aha- the people that vote in <#384025409945337856> are rather critical-
If you don't want so much negative feedback I would suggest posting it somewhere else
sorry
creations-chat 2022-07-04 19:01:58 Yes, but, well, they're toxic. If you want genuine feedback, I would ask in a different channel. If you post it there, you won't get any constructive criticism. Just plain hate.

creations-chat 2022-07-05 01:48:11 ruined the ENTIRE build for me. Can't even look at it the same anymore. A cross-terrain tank, not compatible with RAILS??!? The absolute scandal. Truly a look at the sorry state of today's builds. 0/10 cannot even look at it.
creations-chat 2022-07-05 01:57:34 i thought that was obvious lol

it looks amazing
creations-chat 2022-07-05 02:08:39 any suggestions on how to make this thruster look better? It has to be this wide but it looks blocky
creations-chat 2022-07-05 02:10:42 That's where I'm putting the engines. It's *very* heavy and I need a ton of them. That's also why it needs to be so thick

JRdumptruck thats literally what im asking for advice on
the-dump 2022-07-05 02:11:38 john
creations-chat 2022-07-05 02:13:01 That *is* where I'm putting the hover engines.
Motorlock is not pointless, putting non-locked ones in there doesn't generate enough thrust to take off.
I did not ask for your opinion on if it looks good or bad, <@456226577798135808> . I'd appreciate it if you would fuck off, please and thank you
creations-chat 2022-07-05 02:15:03 "he spends all of his time on discord instead of outside and therefore you should respect him"

Also- I've calculated the thrust. I'm asking about the design

mf only person who needs to be mature here is the one harassing random strangers on the internet when they ask for help
creations-chat 2022-07-05 02:19:18 SEE?? You have the potential to give helpful advice! Why not do that instead of harassing people?

creations-chat 2022-07-05 03:33:12 (edited)

Initially, it said "it looks like ass"
creations-chat 2022-07-05 03:35:42 ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
creations-chat 2022-07-05 03:37:44 It's being an asshole
creations-chat 2022-07-05 03:39:48 still makes you an asshole ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø 
There are better ways to express your opinion
creations-chat 2022-07-05 03:54:23 o yeah right forgot to include that was a different message, but still on the same subject, so it still absolutely applies.
creations-chat 2022-07-05 03:57:25 All of your "feedback" was useless if I'm being honest. 

-Ugly design: not useful feedback
-Ugly wings: also not useful feedback
-thin wings: My wings are a full block thick, that's enough
-exposed rocket engine: It doesn't even turn on. It's an aesthetic detail
-goofy ass cockpit: offers 0 help on how to fix anything, useless advice
creations-chat 2022-07-05 04:04:00 But you're missing something- I understood it when you wrote it like this. When you write "feedback" as a diss instead, it doesn't help.
creations-chat 2022-07-05 04:06:38 If you think it looks dumb, then tell me what you think looks dumb. Don't just tell me it looks bad, that's why I'm posting here. Tell me *what's* wrong, not that it's wrong.
If I knew the problem I wouldn't post here.
creations-chat 2022-07-05 04:08:43 I am fully aware.

-taking <@536395345773461515>'s advice I'll check in later
creations-chat 2022-07-05 04:15:10 it's not really a helicopter lol
creations-chat 2022-07-05 04:17:45 thats what im tryna say
creations-chat 2022-07-05 05:01:11 <@456226577798135808> better cockpit shape?
bot-central 2022-07-05 05:02:43 -ms
creations-chat 2022-07-05 05:03:34 k how can I improve it

What looks massive in comparison to the nose?
creations-chat 2022-07-05 05:05:42 See, I know the glass is a bit long, but I can't really figure out how else to fit it in. The rest of the body would need to be lowered a ton to make the windshield smaller
creations-chat 2022-07-05 05:07:48 ok, how can I improve then? I'd love to hear some suggestions from you!


<@448677698773057547> so I should move the whole nose forward?
creations-chat 2022-07-05 05:10:13 I'm guessing this is malware?
Why do you hate me that much? Fucking piece of shit
creations-chat 2022-07-05 05:14:13 it looks cool imo so I upvoted it
creations-chat 2022-07-05 05:18:06 <@520835790486503434> Idk man whether I think it looks cool or not is kinda up to meüòÇ I think it looks cool so I upvoted it simple as that
creations-chat 2022-07-05 17:06:19 better cockpit?
creations-chat 2022-07-05 17:09:48 (the seat is temporary, I'll move it later)
creations-chat 2022-07-05 17:17:26 bigger in which direction
creations-chat 2022-07-05 17:19:51 Should the head of the nose be fatter, should the nose be wider, should it be longer, or taller

I'm making a large VTOL-style airplane
It's my own design tho
creations-chat 2022-07-05 17:22:09 obviously a WIP, but I still need suggestions on how to fix the nose
creations-chat 2022-07-05 17:24:32 idk about this design tho, it makes it look more like a commercial airliner like the 747, and that's not really the look I'm going for
creations-chat 2022-07-05 17:26:53 I apparently am that dense. Please elaborate >.<

Making it taller would require me to rework the entire airframe, but longer i can probably do
creations-chat 2022-07-05 17:29:25 The entire plane would have to be remade if I tried to make it taller, unless you can see another option?

ohh ok you meant like that
Sure, I can do that
creations-chat 2022-07-05 17:33:46 Would a profile more like this look better?
creations-chat 2022-07-05 17:45:59 why is everyone giving me different advice who do i listen to
creations-chat 2022-07-05 17:48:01 No, I'm just saying awesomegamer is telling me one thing, uknow is telling me something else, BradyHansson is telling me yet another thing, and so is Wertman
creations-chat 2022-07-05 17:50:05 yeah i did that, he's telling me it's better now but now you're telling me to undo it aaaa
creations-chat 2022-07-05 17:52:23 I'll get back to you guys later, I have to do something soon anyways
creations-chat 2022-07-05 18:17:54 is this a criticism or an advice? Sorry it's kind of hard to tell tone of voice over text messages
creations-chat 2022-07-05 18:33:55 Yes, but I didn't understand what the message was trying to convey. Could you elaborate on what you meant?

creations-chat 2022-07-05 21:32:16 This was a couple months ago and I wasn't in the server

And the message I got banned for said something around the lines of "Bro you know this makes you a neo-n*zi right"
creations-chat 2022-07-05 21:36:03 OK FOUND A PICTURE OF IT
His name was "earlycoliethegoalie" but he might be banned already
Edit: he is not banned from Roblox. He might be banned off of plane crazy though. if not, he should be
creations-chat 2022-07-05 21:38:05 iirc it was something about killing the polish, not supporting them lol

contest-chat 2022-07-09 02:02:00 to make
contest-chat 2022-07-09 02:02:09 exactly lol
contest-chat 2022-07-09 02:02:18 <@413827183790915607>
contest-chat 2022-07-09 02:02:36 idk <@401530469952389130> shitting on everybodys builds as usual
contest-chat 2022-07-09 02:03:31 doesnt mean they spent that entire time on the computer?
contest-chat 2022-07-09 02:03:51 maybe they would rather input anything at all rather than not submit\
contest-chat 2022-07-09 02:04:04 so they made a lower-effort build as they had less time to do it
contest-chat 2022-07-09 02:04:30 <@401530469952389130> noted he didnt have enough time so why would you expect them to have all that time
contest-chat 2022-07-09 02:04:51 submitting something is better than submitting nothing ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
contest-chat 2022-07-09 02:05:34 ???
contest-chat 2022-07-09 02:05:36 what?
contest-chat 2022-07-09 02:07:07 some people do it for fun not appreciation of others?
contest-chat 2022-07-09 02:07:15 I have no intention on winning
contest-chat 2022-07-09 02:07:21 I know I have no chance
contest-chat 2022-07-09 02:07:25 I just did it for fun
contest-chat 2022-07-09 02:07:42 If you aren't having fun why play the game
contest-chat 2022-07-09 02:07:46 nothing
contest-chat 2022-07-09 02:08:01 but he's saying your build should be perfect or you shouldnt submit it
contest-chat 2022-07-09 02:08:27 i don't care if they make fun of me, lol
contest-chat 2022-07-09 02:09:00 bro hes not on your side
contest-chat 2022-07-09 02:09:06 he said everyones builds suck
contest-chat 2022-07-09 02:09:47 I don't think "mid" is constructive criticism
contest-chat 2022-07-09 02:09:58 idk man..
contest-chat 2022-07-09 02:10:05 .
contest-chat 2022-07-09 02:10:24 gonk

contest-chat 2022-07-09 02:10:42 lol
contest-chat 2022-07-09 02:10:46 IM NOT
contest-chat 2022-07-09 02:11:01 I don't think the builds are mid
contest-chat 2022-07-09 02:11:02 at all
contest-chat 2022-07-09 02:11:06 they look incredible
contest-chat 2022-07-09 02:11:14 yeah
contest-chat 2022-07-09 02:11:37 I'm saying he shouldnt hold everyone else to his standards
contest-chat 2022-07-09 02:12:48 you can stop trying
contest-chat 2022-07-09 02:12:51 I won't stop you
contest-chat 2022-07-09 02:13:17 cya
the-dump 2022-07-09 02:42:42 HOLY SHIT
the-dump 2022-07-09 02:42:44 TITANFALL 3
creations-chat 2022-07-09 04:04:47 It looks great! Don't listen to <@401530469952389130>, he's just a downer.
If you want feedback, here are my suggestions:
-switch out the half wedges supporting the forks for a different block. Maybe trails?
-build more of a support for behind the fork/lifter thing
-a bit more detail within the cabin, maybe a steering wheel, or a horn as a stick shift
-this might be a reach, but if you really wanted to commit to realism you could vary the size of the wheels
-possibly lower the chassis a bit? Forklifts are built for factory environments, not offroading, so they don't need to be so robust

And mostly of all, never forget, your build isn't bad at all. Sometimes, they just need a bit of work! And honestly? I couldn't pull that off myself. Well done!
creations-chat 2022-07-09 04:07:30 dude. literally fuck off. he needs support right now, and you are not helping in the slightest. go think about how your actions affect others instead of spewing hateful bullshit.

I literally do not care if you don't like it. keep it to yourself. He's sad right now.
creations-chat 2022-07-09 04:09:36 KEEP. IT. TO. YOURSELF.
I DO NOT CARE IF YOU DO NOT LIKE IT.
HE NEEDS SUPPORT AND YOU ARE NOT PROVIDING IT.
creations-chat 2022-07-09 04:11:39 Do you have zero understanding of context? It's clear to me you hurt his feelings. Does not matter if you think it's bad or not. Have some empathy for other people.
creations-chat 2022-07-09 04:13:48 No, but you don't have to go out of your way to make other people feel bad. As I said, keep it to yourself.


discord users realize that more than 1 bad thing can happen at once (99.999% IMPOSSIBLE!!!)
creations-chat 2022-07-09 04:15:50 I never got shit on, lol. I'm trying to comfort someone here.
creations-chat 2022-07-09 04:18:21 I'm kinda pissed because instead of providing helpful feedback, all you told him was that his build looks like ass. Here's helpful feedback by the way, I don't think you know what it means yet.https://hbr.org/2017/10/how-to-give-feedback-people-can-actually-use
creations-chat 2022-07-09 04:20:24 "use more text" WHERE??!? I gave him specific tips on what he can do to make his build better! You gave him vague tips that could apply to literally every part of his build. At least explain your ideas.


Look, man. Not everyone has the same brain as you. You need to explain your ideas in-depth if you want to be of any help to anybody.
creations-chat 2022-07-09 04:22:29 https://thriveworks.com/blog/destructive-vs-constructive-criticism/


<@523003901075521536> I'm not treating him as a toddler, I'm just not being an asshole. https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/504436696021204992/995178683880976505
creations-chat 2022-07-09 04:24:53 And you're treating him like a prisoner in a north korean prison!

For gods sake guys! Please consider other people's feelings!

<@900649045813493810> I'm still here, because I want <@967700242323615744> to know that I care about him.
creations-chat 2022-07-09 04:27:30 I'm not being indifferent, just less harsh than some others. I stated that there was room for improvement. I stated some tips on how to improve. The difference is how I worded my statements so that they don't hurt the person they're directed to.
creations-chat 2022-07-09 04:31:52 That is a good point. But calling names and being hateful for the fun of it is going to set them back even further.
creations-chat 2022-07-09 04:35:00 If you agreed with me, he's probably gonna hate you ¬Ø\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø
creations-chat 2022-07-09 04:37:37 Boy doesn't that remind me of someone
creations-chat 2022-07-09 04:39:49 If you recognize your problems, why do you not try to fix them?

Therapy is a thing, in case this is stemming from some sort of situation at home.
creations-chat 2022-07-09 04:42:36 Bro I assure you, being an asshole is affecting people in your life
creations-chat 2022-07-09 04:44:38 Will do! <@523003901075521536> thank you for being civil and seeing both sides
 mad respect for that
creations-chat 2022-07-09 04:46:40 I think we have stopped arguingüëç

creations-chat 2022-07-12 01:10:59 does it have like a production line and stuff or does it just store them
the-dump 2022-07-12 01:11:20 
creations-chat 2022-07-12 01:13:47 huh ok that might prove a bit of a problem lol
Do you have a screenshot or something so I can tell if I'll just be ripping it off

creations-chat 2022-07-12 01:42:49 <:nooo:787097964946259978>
creations-chat 2022-07-12 01:46:14 reminds me of when I had 4 hours to burn after an exam and designed a jet engine lmao
creations-chat 2022-07-12 01:51:37 I think I threw the drawing away, but it was designed to be an emergency backup thruster meant to be undetectable to heat-seeking missiles and all that

If I recall correctly it did something around the lines of using extreme air pressure to assist in liquidizing oxygen as a propellant with optional fuel injectors. I think it was meant as a kind of backup when you need to keep away from MANPADs and stuff

edit: iirc you could kinda "charge" it by flying and building up pressure
creations-chat 2022-07-12 01:53:54 idk it probably wouldn't work anyways, I think you'd need like 40 bar at least to even assist much in the liquefication
creations-chat 2022-07-12 02:08:55 is this a good color for coconuts? Cuz if it isn't I'm gonna have a lot of trouble down the line
creations-chat 2022-07-12 02:11:30 eh idk, does it look much better?
creations-chat 2022-07-12 02:14:56 a bit better yeah

creations-chat 2022-07-12 17:03:24 yeah, i know lol, that's why I'm asking for tips. 

I spent most of that time making stupid shit like these
creations-chat 2022-07-12 17:05:32 it opens and closes to catch people lmaoo
creations-chat 2022-07-12 17:08:16 but fr i would appreciate tips on how to improve, possibly on the airplane I'm working on
creations-chat 2022-07-12 17:11:38 I used it in a few places already
creations-chat 2022-07-12 17:14:43 I experimented with making it wider but it ends up looking really weird
creations-chat 2022-07-12 17:16:48 bro at least tell me what's wrong with it or where you think it needs angle lock
creations-chat 2022-07-12 17:23:51 -_- thanks a lot dude
creations-chat 2022-07-12 17:29:12 ik lol
creations-chat 2022-07-12 17:31:51 I don't play public servers, lol
creations-chat 2022-07-12 17:34:27 ???I have my own private server, if it's got other people what's the point???

creations-chat 2022-07-13 05:44:25 <@806862476804489336> sick jetüëç
creations-chat 2022-07-13 05:50:31 but, always room for improvement! I'd try to learn angle locking, and then retrying the body. Here's a tutorial! https://youtu.be/milhBhz92AQ

Also, it might be worth a shot to make the jet a bit less square, and more streamlined. I might be able to give some more advice if I had some better day pictures :) <@806862476804489336>
creations-chat 2022-07-13 06:01:45 Bruhhh <@499693926878281728> fuck is this?? You know they're fascists right???
creations-chat 2022-07-13 06:04:05 OH AND HE DID THIS A WHILE AGO OKAY BRO

 <@195253906333368320> I don't really think we want this guy here
creations-chat 2022-07-13 06:06:07 OH FUCK I PINGED THE WRONG GUY I MEANT RBK SHITTT
creations-chat 2022-07-13 06:08:10 fr bro he probably thinks he's so funny and "based" when all he does is spit alt-right bullshit
creations-chat 2022-07-13 06:10:13 dude like for real not funny
creations-chat 2022-07-13 06:12:18 bro my trans best friend literally killed herself this isn't funny at all
creations-chat 2022-07-13 06:14:46 go fuck yourself dude

Fucking piece of shit

Who do I ping to get him banned
creations-chat 2022-07-13 06:16:50 <@466793357318815744> <@401530469952389130> thinks trans teens killing themselves is humorous to him, he takes pleasure at the loss of human life
creations-chat 2022-07-13 06:19:48 >gif representing trans teen killing themselves
<@401530469952389130>: Haha based, I support this statement
creations-chat 2022-07-13 06:23:00 My screenshot mentions a gif of a transgender person killing themselves. <@401530469952389130> thinks this is a good thing. nothing more to explain, really. I don't understand how you guys think this is acceptable in the slightest.
creations-chat 2022-07-13 06:25:21 Bro I don't think you're a leftist if you're such a fucking transphobe asshole
Say that shit on a more left-wing server you're out in a couple minutes

<@723940197456281640> read the screenshot
creations-chat 2022-07-13 06:28:03 And how does this justify blatant transphobia?

<@723940197456281640> he said "based gif" not "based obc" so I think it's clear what he supports here
creations-chat 2022-07-13 06:31:11 Doesn't mean you should be able to say it without backlash. It was a truly awful and insensitive thing to say. I don't think you would do the same if you had lost a good friend the same way as I did.

<@611367022567358579> doesn't mean you should be discriminated against for it
creations-chat 2022-07-13 06:36:26 literally admits to it ok, fucking asshole who do I ping to ban you
creations-chat 2022-07-13 06:39:38 Yeah he did lol, the server shouldn't tolerate blatant transphobia and people killing themselves. <@466793357318815744>
creations-chat 2022-07-13 06:41:47 You said trans people killing themselves was something you get joy out of
creations-chat 2022-07-13 06:44:36 He still hasn't listed a reason this should be allowed by the way
creations-chat 2022-07-13 06:46:42 He personally said it "wasn't meant to be funny." He is completely serious.
creations-chat 2022-07-13 06:50:00 12:48
creations-chat 2022-07-13 06:55:35 Doesn't realize it's a figure of speech

creations-chat 2022-07-13 07:22:20 I said I'm on mobile. Do you want me to spend 6 hours on it or what? I have the ability to draw better but I'm not using it for a little drawing as a reference to what I'm talking about
creations-chat 2022-07-13 07:24:42 jeez bro how does this look like it was ever intended to look realistic
Most of my artwork is cartoon styled anyways


Literally why do you care
creations-chat 2022-07-13 07:26:56 ok here's something I spent an hour on instead

Happy?
creations-chat 2022-07-13 07:28:58 I don't want an argument, he just keeps insulting the stupid 30 second reference drawing I did
creations-chat 2022-07-13 07:31:02 bro just understand it was never meant to look good and leave it at that, I didn't put effort into any details because there wasn't any reason to. End of discussion. üëç

creations-chat 2022-07-18 17:21:12 upvotes-downvotes=score
creations-chat 2022-07-18 20:53:42 it's custom, but I guess the tail looks pretty similar so that's an easy mistake to make
creations-chat 2022-07-18 22:18:30 ...I'm pretty sure that was the point...
creations-chat 2022-07-18 22:20:39 it's really low in the water, add more helium or remove some ballast
creations-chat 2022-07-18 22:22:43 I'd just say, make the hull angle a lot steeper and bring it further out of the water. If what <@658071879881326642> is true just add what I said and I'll upvote u

creations-chat 2022-07-19 00:14:08 whats the things in the front
the little sticks
creations-chat 2022-07-19 19:02:00 <@556441246848122891> looks sick but gives me flashbacks of feeling sick

every lufthansa I've been on smelled really bad
creations-chat 2022-07-19 19:05:40 yeah, you're probably right, I've only ever flown Lufthansa within the EU
creations-chat 2022-07-19 22:18:49 :o
creations-chat 2022-07-20 17:44:26 <@824548860168634379> If I'm being honest it needs some work. Here's some things you might consider adding:

-something around the escape pods to make it so you can't see the interior from the outside of the ship

-angle lock instead of a motor for the black part near the front with ladders on it

-a turret on the bottom maybe? This could give it some more profile and a less pencil-like appearance

-more points jutting out on the sides, as it looks really straight at the moment (aerodynamics don't matter in space so make it whatever shape you want)

-more variation to the color palette. use some *slightly* different shades of color to give it more texture and less monotone appearance

-make the end less flat. It might be as flat as it is because you don't know how to use folding. Try to learn that if you don't know how to do it.

-The front has a lot of ridges that make the build look a bit more janky. Try to smooth them out with some motorlock or maybe just some wedges

-This is a personal opinion but I think a tower on the top, like a destroyer, would look good and give it some more profile

-Don't know why you just have floating motors on top of it but they really don't add to the look

-Give it a more defined cockpit, I would go with a ball shape

I hope these can help you and I'd love to see any progress you make on it!
creations-chat 2022-07-20 17:48:00 aha ok

could you try to hide them somehow
creations-chat 2022-07-20 17:51:36 <@670636377792184330> the build looks just as good without the flag that could get you banned lol you really don't need it there
creations-chat 2022-07-20 17:53:37 yeah but it has some obvious implications when the build is a boat from world war II
creations-chat 2022-07-20 17:56:07 this one isn't from a time when that symbol was associated with fascism lol

im not gonna argue with you guys lol i give up you win
creations-chat 2022-07-20 17:59:17 I'm not saying banned off the server. But I've been temp banned for even mentioning the ""affiliated group"" in roblox so that's a possibility for you
creations-chat 2022-07-20 18:01:29 bruh you're so oblivious I don't even understand how you reached this level
creations-chat 2022-07-20 18:05:09 IM NOT SAYING YOU'RE A BAD PERSON FOR THIS

I'm saying, Roblox has banned me before for even mentioning that group. So building a symbol that is most commonly associated with the aforementioned group is *likely* not going to garner a positive response from Roblox moderation if someone takes it the wrong way.
creations-chat 2022-07-20 18:07:14 source: just trust me bro
creations-chat 2022-07-20 18:09:16 I know a guy who got banned for one 
lol

so i think its kinda just your word against mine at this point
we don't really have a way of confirming either point so lets drop this stupid argument
creations-chat 2022-07-20 18:11:31 iirc it was something soviet-related

<@636996526878490624> realizing people can have misunderstandings: üò±
I was in BC for most of last week
creations-chat 2022-07-20 18:16:42 ok but if im being entirely honest? The flag makes it look worse. it's a bit of a sore spot and doesn't really match the rest of the carrier. If you so insist on having the stupid symbol then put it somewhere that it doesn't clash with the rest of the build
creations-chat 2022-07-20 18:18:52 bro stop putting words in my mouth when did I ever say that the real thing wasn't awful either (obviously much worse)
creations-chat 2022-07-20 18:20:58 bro it looks like shit its so big and the colors clash with the rest of the ship

at least change the color of the wood or something so it looks more like irl and doesn't clash so much with the rest of the deck
creations-chat 2022-07-20 18:23:43 bruhh im telling you i never said the original looked good either they both look awful
creations-chat 2022-07-20 18:27:33 CAUSE IT LOOKS LIKE SHIT
creations-chat 2022-07-20 18:29:44 you're messing up friendliness with helpfulness lol I have given him feedback on how to improve and he's ignored it

(also that is *not* the same color)
creations-chat 2022-07-20 18:31:56 no lol they just call it shit and say "idk uhhh motorlock" when people ask why

I gave him specific advice on what to do and he's ignored it

I told you to either: 
-remove the iron cross/flag
-or change the color of the deck
creations-chat 2022-07-20 18:34:07 yeah looks sick
creations-chat 2022-07-20 18:36:20 you literally said that there's different versions just choose the one that actually looks good in roblox
creations-chat 2022-07-20 18:40:57 I know you're not gonna do that so at least change the color of the deck so it doesn't look as bad. or maybe make the cross a bit faded or something so it matches the rest of the ship and doesn't look like someone photoshopped a jpeg onto the ship
creations-chat 2022-07-20 18:43:09 yes, I do. Because the alignment of the symbol and the time period that ship was built in makes it very unlikely it has any other meaning.
creations-chat 2022-07-20 18:47:12 yeah under a totalitarian regime that killed millions

you realize that excellence was in allegiance to the one of the most awful causes known to man, right?
creations-chat 2022-07-20 18:49:50 ARE YOU FUCKING DEFENDING THEM

WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK
creations-chat 2022-07-20 18:52:01 <@456226577798135808> be like: 17 million deaths is pretty epic right guys

"brave or loyal" yeah loyal to the regime that killed millions of civilians
creations-chat 2022-07-20 18:55:11 Those soldiers carried out the direct orders of their leader. All of them should be held accountable for their actions. I absolutely cannot believe I have to explain why they were bad. Did you learn nothing in history class?
creations-chat 2022-07-20 18:57:19 HOLY FUCKING SHIT

dude fuck this shit i am not arguing with you guys over why the n*zi party was bad.


"they didn't only do bad stuff" what the actual fuck
creations-chat 2022-07-20 18:59:25 <@466793357318815744> this guy defending a certain 1940s totalitarian regime<:4Weird:709084058721714324>
creations-chat 2022-07-20 19:01:28 bro im over the iron cross im just appalled at how both of these guys are trying to defend the actions of the n*zi party
creations-chat 2022-07-20 19:03:39 "guys im not pro nasi or anything" proceeds to say the most pro-n_zi thing I have ever heard


<@456226577798135808> we are discussing the n_zi implications here.
creations-chat 2022-07-20 19:05:42 literally nobody has been discussing the prussians here. They are entirely irrelevant to this conversation. You're bringing them up to try and save your ass after you defended the n_zis


<@401530469952389130> the vast majority of n_zi soldiers supported the regime. They should all be held accountable
creations-chat 2022-07-20 19:08:13 <@456226577798135808> did you ask Wilhelm II directly??
creations-chat 2022-07-20 19:10:15 they keep bringing it up, im done with that shit, I'm just mad at how some guys in here are supporting the n_zis

<@773078338670428191> seeing the guy he supports do something: omg such yes!! amazing point!
<@773078338670428191> seeing the guy hes arguing against make the same point: what an idiot omg
creations-chat 2022-07-20 19:12:38 yeah doesnt make them any less supportive of the killing of civilians ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

<@701949629708632096> stop bringing it up dude im fucking done with that shit
creations-chat 2022-07-20 19:14:46 >doesn't support the n_zis

yep what an idiot<:clueless:942802644043464734>

YES. STUPID. I have said over and over that it isnt about that. stop bringing it up
creations-chat 2022-07-20 19:16:50 üòêso funny

in what sense do i have no regard for history
I'm the only one here recognizing the atrocities the n_zi party committed
creations-chat 2022-07-20 19:18:57 <@456226577798135808> you're black right???

<@393679134779375616> yes i misunderstood. I know. I've said it literally like 10 times now. This isn't about that anymore.
creations-chat 2022-07-20 19:21:25 I literally admitted that I was wrong on that point like over half an hour ago what do you mean
creations-chat 2022-07-20 19:24:09 <@487016674260680716> this was like an hour and a half ago

<@887490533990223902> I am not talking about the iron cross anymore. I stopped like 45 minutes ago. These dumbasses keep bringing it up for no apparent reason
creations-chat 2022-07-20 19:26:42 I ended that discussion and then someone said something aroumd the lines of "the n-zis are bad, BUT" and that pissed me off. Nothing more to say really. Can't change your guys tiny minds so I'm gonna stop trying. Bye.

creations-chat 2022-07-30 06:52:55 Yeah I'm saying it's kinda depressing to see people devoting that much time to a game/appreciation from others that that's what they decide is the feature of themselves they want to advertise

<@523003901075521536> no lol I just start arguments all the time and piss people off that's why they hate me

creations-chat 2022-07-30 07:08:46 Never said anything about furries, but I'm a strong advocate of LG TV OLED 4K HD, and that.. conflicts with the viewpoints of other members of this server, leading to some arguments
creations-chat 2022-07-30 07:12:56 I don't think it's my obligation but I'm very connected to it (I'm straight, cis, but friends and stuff) so I find it pretty hard to keep quiet when ppl are smack talking something so close to me 

Plus when they basically made fun of me because my LGTV friend killed herself but that's a different can of beans
creations-chat 2022-07-30 07:19:41 Yeah, I recognize that the server is mostly kids that'll grow out of it and at least find some comfort in the fact that 99% of the people I argue with would cringe to oblivion if they saw what they had said in 10 years lol

or not idk whatever
creations-chat 2022-08-07 23:01:18 why would the hull take so much? I get the other parts but I don't get why you'd need all that much just for the hull

creations-chat 2022-08-08 06:33:58 I feel like alt-right views outweigh wanting some liberal things though
creations-chat 2022-08-08 06:36:20 Yknow what I mean? Some issues have more weight than others
creations-chat 2022-08-08 06:44:31 What's on the other side of the scale then
creations-chat 2022-08-08 06:47:43 We're having a civilized discussion not an argument so stay outta this
creations-chat 2022-08-08 06:52:54 idk I agree with that stuff but I don't know if you're really fully free of media bias when you promote hate against minority groups(NOT TRYING TO START AN ARGUMENT) 

Its just that far right groups are also radicalizing the youth/population. I don't think either of the US' parties are a good option (thank God I don't live there) but I think one side is a bit less evil than the others. An overhaul of the 2-party system would be called for though.

(No hate, just trying to help you see another viewpoint)
creations-chat 2022-08-08 06:59:38 I kind of feel the opposite, at least for the liberal side of things. (The Republicans are already super radical, roe v wade etc) but the US' democrats seem to be just barely on the left.
Instead of implementing useful things for the general public they add things other countries already take for granted (I'm üá∏üá™/üá®üá¶ so there's an example). 

A "liberal" viewpoint there is to *lower* the price of medication, where as a far-right perspective here could be to have them cost anything at all.
creations-chat 2022-08-08 07:01:49 taking away bodily autonomy seems pretty radical to me, you don't agree or?

The whole point of that message was to say both sides are lacking. Lmao did you even read it
creations-chat 2022-08-08 07:06:15 I was talking about the parties themselves, not their constituents

My point was I wish the democratic party was more liberal
creations-chat 2022-08-08 07:09:23 No my point is the party leadership is not listening to the people they represent, but the people have no better choice

creations-chat 2022-10-20 02:36:18 point in case, if you only ask delusional people like <@883063424614006878> you're going to get different results than asking people that didn't drop out of grade 9 social studies
creations-chat 2022-10-20 02:39:08 You guys are literally the textbook definition of edgelords

creations-chat 2022-10-20 02:45:34 Now you're getting it! üòÑ You're right, there are only 2 s__es (excluding intersex people). As you demonstrated, gender and s** are not the same.

creations-chat 2022-10-20 02:50:17 Yes, that's called s*x, not gender. If you had actually read the textbook you would have understood that.

some of you mfs need to learn to read
creations-chat 2022-10-20 02:53:13 "some book" definitely not a *textbook*, used in universities, and peer reviewed by probably hundreds of people. A literal textbook isn't just "some book."
creations-chat 2022-10-20 02:56:14 please link to a peer reviewed article. If you have one, please link peer reviewed statistics on worldwide mental disorder rates.
creations-chat 2022-10-20 02:58:26 Then don't quote bullshit you made up like it's a fact.
creations-chat 2022-10-20 03:02:55 These sources have no way of being politically biased. We are looking at basic crime statistics reported by the US justice system.

<@706717603258957864> Gay marriage wasn't codified into US law until 2015.
creations-chat 2022-10-20 03:05:06 So gay people should have to hide themselves just to not be killed over an unchangeable part of themselves?

<@706717603258957864> yes and that's why nobody's protesting for gay marriage to be codified into law, it's already been done. What's your point

creations-chat 2022-10-27 02:48:08 <@937119057042358322> do i go over it with paints
creations-chat 2022-10-28 19:37:43 <@809404838692519946> I'd suggest working on making the whole build less blocky as well as adding some variation to colors (EX: if your color is 100-100-100 make some blocks colored 105-105-105 and some of them 90-90-90 or 100-85-100 for more variation in the paintjob)
creations-chat 2022-10-28 19:40:23 Looks pretty good to me, only thing I might change is angle lock this part instead of leaving it blocky. Also you might want to vary your paintjob like I was talking about above, but personally I think it looks good

creations-chat 2022-12-26 06:50:58 yeah idk in my opinion it's sort of ok to put it on actual existent vehicles that would have it, but putting it on custom vehicles crosses the line into glorification territory. Just my opinion though
