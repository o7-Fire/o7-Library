creations-chat 2022-04-15 22:17:06 No one said anything bad about it?
creations-chat 2022-04-15 22:18:53 I would like feedback because I personally see nothing wrong
creations-chat 2022-04-15 22:21:01 so three blocks is to wide for you? Its a huey it cant get any thinner
creations-chat 2022-04-15 22:23:00 Also tail is proportionate and it is in fact three blocks wide  it has half block walls.
creations-chat 2022-04-15 22:24:47 fair enough but three blocks is all useable space and I am trying to find better colours for it since I do agree with colors
creations-chat 2022-04-15 22:30:39 Also the huey is blocky due to simple thing, I can't motor lock that well and I would rather be able to control it than have my manuvaring stuff invisible
creations-chat 2022-05-10 05:29:56 What is wrong with helicopter?
creations-chat 2022-05-10 06:24:37 its based on old helicopters it is supposed to be plain
creations-chat 2022-05-10 06:46:41 mainly H-13
creations-chat 2022-05-10 07:15:16 And what is specifically wrong with it?
creations-chat 2022-05-10 07:20:04 Well kinda hard to say the shape of my own made up heli that is based on a combination of helis is bed
creations-chat 2022-05-10 07:27:58 exact parts,
-tail: truss idea from H-13, Fins are from Bell 206
-Rotor, Rotor shape and droop is from H-13
-Cockpit: Based on H-13 bubble cockpit and OH-6 Bubble cockpit
-Housing of everything behind cockpit: shaped from OH-6 and is just sealed off like the artillery protection for old spotter aircraft.

bug-reports 2022-09-29 23:31:20 You cant paint signs it just forces you to edit the text it wont allow you to change font once this occurs. It stays that way until you delete the text sign but after a bit occurs again.(This is in build mode)
bug-reports 2022-09-30 01:32:12 Yea but it stops blocks from being placed
bug-reports 2022-09-30 02:06:17 thanks
