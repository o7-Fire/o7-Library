creations-chat 2020-10-20 08:25:15 I like how people upvote trash builds and not actually good time consuming builds to trt to be funny
creations-chat 2020-10-20 08:26:52 How does a trash 5 minute mini plane build get more upvotes than  a 5 hour+ actually good build?
creations-chat 2020-10-20 08:28:02 Effort? It took 5-15 minutes. There is no effort in that
creations-chat 2020-10-20 08:29:20 There is no detail in that mini corsair one
creations-chat 2020-10-20 08:30:21 The f4 phantom mini was good. The f4u was just straight up bad
creations-chat 2020-10-20 08:31:34 > It looks good? I don't see anything wrong with that build that diserves a downvote. Your only comeplaint is that it's small. That's not a valid complaint
> 
> Also <@456226577798135808> looks good
<@407347404858458123> its not just that. Ive seen absolute shit builds get 20+ upvotes but builds far better getting not even 1/8 of the upvotes the trash build has
creations-chat 2020-10-20 08:32:46 <@251880826386513924>  are the indents on the sides torpedo launchers?
creations-chat 2020-10-20 08:34:00 If thats what the boat is, you should probably try to make some torpedos that shoot out and then glide through the water
