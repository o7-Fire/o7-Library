creations-chat 2022-08-16 03:56:56 how do i post images in creations
creations-chat 2022-08-16 03:59:01 i didn't see it calm down
creations-chat 2022-09-16 03:14:20 oh really? what sucks about that is that it actually isn't, look at the A2D-1, Wyvern S4, TBM 940, etc. notice how they all have a **propeller** and not a jet/turbojet/turbofan on it
creations-chat 2022-09-16 03:16:43 as for the wings, how else am i supposed to get a 2 striped wing design over a 1x4 delta wing?
creations-chat 2022-09-16 03:18:47 over a 1x4 delta wing? how am i supposed to have 4 stripes on a single 1x4 delta wing?
creations-chat 2022-09-16 03:21:21 no because that's an air breathing jet
creations-chat 2022-09-16 03:23:26 the main thing you see is the propeller, not the hot air it exhausts backwards

the engine isn't meant to look nice, it's meant to work properly which it does
creations-chat 2022-09-16 03:25:55 probably because that's the only thing you know to use

and again, it's not just for looks
creations-chat 2022-09-16 03:28:25 i can make the wings better, but i ask again, how do i make wings with a striped pattern without breaking the build?
