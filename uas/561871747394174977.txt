help 2021-05-14 07:02:40 And if you have checked motor settings and u have no anchor block there, its maybe something taht is attached to the motorlock, causing it to not be able to motorlock. It may also be a ghost block, that you cannot see in build mode. And please act more friendly, im only trying to help.

creations-chat 2021-05-15 05:32:10 Tower in that state takes up 1/4 of a plot before folding, which means it is not enough space for a correctly scaled one. And the starship i made has a heatshield, ao i cant make the fins grey that would look like shit. And ive tried making starship grey too, downvotes all over the place.
creations-chat 2021-05-15 05:37:27 I will make it either white, or super shiny grey like the real thing. Until they release a shiny metal material im using white

creations-chat 2021-05-18 14:22:22 thats the same story when it comes to my endurance from interstellar (that is still WIP)
creations-chat 2021-05-18 15:22:33 <@!627207091378978846> not 1:1. if you would make it 1:1, then it would be 11 blocks wide and about 52 blocks tall. ||it is 11 blocks cause starship is 9meter in diameter, and if 1meter=1 block, i cant make 3mm walls. so it would be 11 since walls add about 2 blocks to the diameter.||

creations-chat 2021-05-23 15:46:53 yes i do, making a smooth hull in plane crazy is actually farely easy if you actually know what all the wedges look like , and what wedges do the best job in different situations.
creations-chat 2021-05-23 15:49:58 you couldve done a much better job if you used the right wedges and maybe some motorlock, but as in the pics u sent, the sparrow **does** look smooth on the front aerodynamic hull, unlike yours.

type faster<:PepeLaugh:697130830081818634>
creations-chat 2021-05-23 15:52:28 you dont have to be as good as Herrguggi to do such a simple motorlock, just experiment around and atleast **actually try** to make it work with motorlock, just saying.
creations-chat 2021-05-23 15:56:46 i agree
creations-chat 2021-05-24 08:14:56 <@582834773773254656> specify what made you downvote my endurance, im all for improving on it.
creations-chat 2021-05-24 08:17:16 Its to make it have a functional interior where you can actually walk around. I might make a version soon that doesent have interior, where the bridges are thinner and more realistic.

creations-chat 2022-05-21 19:32:01 <@466793357318815744> the engines cant be bigger than 2x1x1 (due due to the scale of the build), which means i have to use the normal engines.. sadly.
the-dump 2022-06-04 17:53:15 no. thats bloodplasma. hes talking about plasma, not bloodplasma
the-dump 2022-06-04 17:55:27 bloodplasma is that yellow liquid that blood is composed 55% of
the-dump 2022-06-04 17:55:43 plasma when it comes to the 4th state of matter, is just a gas so hot it glows
the-dump 2022-06-04 18:24:19 ik, im just simplifying it so the guy understands
the-dump 2022-06-04 18:25:30 btw you literally said it glows because of heat lmao
the-dump 2022-06-04 18:26:07 and the heat doesent rip the electrons apart, it rips them from the atom itself making the atom an ion. which means its the heat thats making it charged

creations-chat 2022-09-25 19:41:56 i cant find anything in <#384025409945337856> that can do addition AND subtraction  with numbers above 20
creations-chat 2022-09-26 05:36:05 No, not if you use binary. 1's and 0's.
creations-chat 2022-09-26 11:08:58 Mechanical logic gates exist

Im working on the calculator rn, and im using the principle that when you push smth 1 block forward its a 1, and when its idle its a 0.
creations-chat 2022-09-26 11:11:21 Heres a screenshot from a while ago.. 2 full adders connected together

For every full adder i add, the number of numbers its able to process double.
creations-chat 2022-09-26 14:16:35 it is. if i just double what i have there, it can calculatue numbers up to 64. if i add another one again, it can add numbers up to 512.
creations-chat 2022-09-26 14:19:24 just binary numbers, you would have to translate yourself. a binary to 7 segment display converter is much much bigger than what i can fit on a plot.
