creations-chat 2021-12-09 02:20:09 It's quite hard to detail helicopters though
creations-chat 2021-12-09 02:22:45 8.69/10 for me because I think it looks amazing but it's not the best I've seen, but I know it's hard to detail helicopters because of the weight distribution
creations-chat 2021-12-09 02:28:50 I'd recommend making the tail fin a little more detailed but over all it's pretty good, and if you don't have any yet add some red and green wing lights, because they have those on irl helicopters

creations-chat 2023-06-27 16:49:14 just applied for shipwright IV
creations-chat 2023-06-29 05:47:14 Any thoughts so far?
creations-chat 2023-06-29 13:01:10 It helps when building insides or complex shapes, it's an easier color for me to recognize sides in shadows
creations-chat 2023-06-29 13:03:11 It's one of the things that are still in progress as I have no clue on how to make an anchor look good on this build
