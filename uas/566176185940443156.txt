bug-reports 2019-12-21 12:26:35 Why does my motor move by itself? It’s like it is haunted by a ghost and it will move around even though I’m literally not touching the keyboard and it also will fly around going the direction the motor isn’t suppose to go. For example: if the motor is facing right, the motor should be able to ONLY moving the block up and down or something( I don’t know the word for it but hope you understand), BUT it goes for example left and right! Please fix this, it will help making mech motors that will go every direction easier

bug-reports 2020-07-09 01:24:23 I found this bug where if you type in ":" in a text, and load it, it will become tagged. The tagged word is actually a 2, I know that because the first time I encountered the glitched, it wasn't tagged. I tested this with every sized text, all of them does the same thing except for 1x1 text. It seems to make the text's size 1, but keep the word in but not the ":" in the text.

creations-chat 2021-01-31 13:00:23 You know those times where you make a badass mech but it's not balanced when flying and trips after about 15 steps because the body is too fast and it gets it's arms stuck on air at the worst time possible, yeah you know those moments
creations-chat 2021-01-31 13:03:20 It's a really bruh momento, I get compliments from others but probably a giant rectangle with some cutters on motors can beat my shitty mech because the performance is shit
creations-chat 2021-01-31 13:06:23 Dem time where you get ebikly failed by the community.
creations-chat 2021-03-12 09:09:07 Yeah, I'm not that good with photography B(
creations-chat 2021-03-12 09:16:56 I mean I've tried but the angle just doesn't look cool, but you do get to see more of the mech in the cost of making it look shit
creations-chat 2021-03-12 09:22:08 Thanks, you're a great comrade to have for the mech community-
