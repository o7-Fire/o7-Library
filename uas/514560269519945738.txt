creations-chat 2019-08-21 16:27:37 I tried to make a piper cub to the best of my ability,
Is not a quick plane, but it is fun to fly.

creations-chat 2019-08-21 16:31:31 Thank you,
I also make a fictional nose wheel version instead of tailwheel
creations-chat 2019-08-21 16:39:14 Also made a DHC-7 Dash 7. It used to be a Bombardier Dash Q-100
But I though It was way to slow, so I put 2 extra props on the sides of the wings and out came a DHC-7 Dash 7
