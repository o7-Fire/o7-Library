help 2020-12-20 04:51:20 I need help getting this Fo tie interceptor to fly straight, due to it having long wings its incredibly unbalanced and I'm not sure what to do, I was sent from general over to this channel and I need some recommendations
help 2020-12-20 04:53:17 wdym?
help 2020-12-20 04:53:26 no
help 2020-12-20 04:53:34 due to the wings being long
help 2020-12-20 04:53:45 ill give a better photo, its a mess
help 2020-12-20 04:54:32 indeed i know motor locking
help 2020-12-20 04:55:02 i tried taking the wing sections out of the wings to see if it did anything
help 2020-12-20 04:55:22 only problem is that i dont have any space for a locking tree
creations-chat 2022-04-04 18:42:49 I would personally thin it down just a tad bit but the proportions & shaping in general look good to me.
creations-chat 2022-04-04 20:45:42 I’m assuming this is the cockpit of a B-2 Northrop Grumman Spirit..?
creations-chat 2022-04-05 16:37:22 I’d suggest not attempting to do an “Aeveryone” Ping…
creations-chat 2022-04-05 16:42:17 Because, the Official PC Discord Server is often very passive aggressive & also very harsh. If you’re not careful you’ll have some kid screaming at you saying “shut up no rank” just because you decided to attempt to give criticism or said something. I personally love watching <#504436696021204992> because of how toxic people get at one another.

creations-chat 2022-05-19 20:05:39 Is that the classic Toxeed F-16??
creations-chat 2022-05-19 20:07:29 God that thing is a piece of crap, PC would have been better if the Toxeed F-16 was never a reality.
creations-chat 2022-05-19 22:25:09 Agreed.
creations-chat 2022-05-19 22:27:45 I don’t think the wings are even large enough to be accurate to scale?
creations-chat 2022-05-19 22:35:15 Applying this very logic, in theory I could build a 1x20000 beam, spanning the entire map and it would be considered good.

creations-chat 2022-05-24 15:31:47 Let him have his own little moment of accomplishment, you can crush his dreams later.
creations-chat 2022-05-24 19:13:15 Orrr you could’ve just started with asking for feedback instead of acting like an entitled moron. As Themor said, you were saying quite a few negative things while acting like you were above everyone else. You never asked for any feedback & that can easily be proven by just simply scrolling up on the timeline. Don’t try and victimize yourself, especially if you caused it.
creations-chat 2022-05-24 19:56:37 Oh lawd he comin.
creations-chat 2022-05-24 19:59:32 (If it wasn’t evident enough.)
creations-chat 2022-05-24 20:02:36 Harsenal, listen to yourself right now, you are literally talking about a Roblox PC build. It’s Plane Crazy, it doesn’t have to be perfect, besides it’s literally made of fucking blocks.
creations-chat 2022-05-24 20:05:53 I agree that it may not necessarily deserve HoF but at the same time you can’t go complaining about it just because you don’t approve of the thickness of the ropes. This isn’t intended to be a 1:1 Scale Replica, so stop acting like it.
creations-chat 2022-05-24 20:35:38 I didn’t upvote it because it was big, I upvoted it because it’s clear enough that they put some actual effort and time into it.
creations-chat 2022-05-24 20:37:53 Yet here you are automatically assuming that I only upvoted it for being big yet I didn’t. It seems a bit un-just to say such a thing when it isn’t true.
creations-chat 2022-05-24 20:42:16 You’re ignoring the fact that you’re judging people just because the up-voted a creation.
creations-chat 2022-05-24 22:29:28 Welcome to PC <#504436696021204992>
creations-chat 2022-05-25 05:43:17 Wait nvm, lol. I was thinking of the B variant for VTOL.
creations-chat 2022-05-25 05:46:58 The reason for the larger wingspan is due to it ofc needing more lift to be capable of carrier based operations and still being able to have a decent range and agreeable payload. And to compensate for the larger wingspan the F-35C utilizes folding wings for a better footprint when storing. Similar to how you would sweep the wings of a Tomcat or the folding of an F/A-18.
creations-chat 2022-05-25 19:21:22 💀
creations-chat 2022-05-25 19:26:35 This looks like they were doing fairly good on the front but once they got to the back they just went insane.
creations-chat 2022-05-25 19:28:50 Agreed. ~~It would be kinda interesting though to watch people argue with a 6 hour delay…~~
creations-chat 2022-05-25 21:25:26 Can’t tell if your excited or not.
creations-chat 2022-05-26 21:52:27 Damn, this is some true crime investigation type shit right here.
creations-chat 2022-05-26 21:55:45 It’s from Just Cause - 3 which isn’t known for the most realistic of plane models.
creations-chat 2022-05-26 22:00:58 It seems fine except there seems to maybe be a full pilot model inside the canopy, unless that’s the actual player flying it, which doesn’t seem very believable to me for some reason.
And yeah, I agree BM would prove it.
<@707133341454958604> That’s exatcly my thought.
creations-chat 2022-05-26 22:07:53 Agreed.
creations-chat 2022-05-26 22:35:54 OMG BAN BRO BAN
creations-chat 2022-05-27 07:10:56 Well he was definitely guilty given that he left at 10:00pm, Lmfao. Mission Accomplished bois.
creations-chat 2022-05-27 21:21:30 Still far longer than yours.
creations-chat 2022-05-27 21:24:19 It’s the exact same type bruv, only difference is that the photos are two different sides of the same type, because it’s Asymmetrical. <@761854427262353408> It even has the same number of turbine exhausts.
creations-chat 2022-05-27 21:26:45 It’s a fairly close match, close enough for me. And the number doesn’t mean model number, it’s the same as a tail number Id. & The paint doesn’t mean much either, just has to indicate that it’s a Union Pacific.
creations-chat 2022-05-27 21:29:02 Because it’s an updated variant.
creations-chat 2022-05-27 21:43:31 Jeffo, I didn’t ask for your opinion. And I don’t see how high-lighting my rank is a valid argument if you don’t even have one of your own.
creations-chat 2022-05-27 21:46:49 Splitz, build which ever one you want. There the same train, just different variants of the same platform.

I don’t see why you would try and bring in a separate point of buying different variations of the same model of locomotive, either.
creations-chat 2022-05-27 21:49:13 Bruv, its a fucking train.
creations-chat 2022-06-09 21:34:20 Ayo, someone give me a Toxxed F-16 pic rq.
creations-chat 2022-06-09 21:40:08 That swoosh though…
creations-chat 2022-06-11 21:36:53 Yeah, we call it a dodecagon…
creations-chat 2022-08-01 17:24:37 I am incredibly confused by this “Tik tok Kid”, please do tell me this is ironic.

<@401530469952389130>, fr?, jesus christ.
creations-chat 2022-08-01 17:29:28 No. Piston Landing Gears are horrible, buggy, limited in the designs you can create, etc. The best functional landing gear Imo is a good motor-2, that is if you aren’t in a buggy server.

You can create a full smoothed out landing gear by using 1x2-1x3 or 1x1 texts to hold the gear together which will allow for you to make a one wide fully flush with the fuselage functional gear, works especially well with small aircraft.
creations-chat 2022-08-01 17:32:52 Two Words, M O T O R  L O C K .

Sorry for the Reply Ping, <@873696499513561088> Didn’t realize I still had a selected @reply on you.
creations-chat 2022-08-01 17:40:38 Anyways, is there an explanation for why Ritual has labeled these two completely separate aircraft as just different Livery?
(Forgor to include photo 💀)
creations-chat 2022-08-01 17:43:19 Eh, I just find it odd that he’s comparing two completely different builds. That’s all.
Or just delete the msg Ig.
creations-chat 2022-08-01 17:46:27 Indeed they are, Indeed they are.
help 2022-10-05 16:25:54 Been working on an ADF-11 as of late and I've started with the main nose point, and I used some 3-axis pieces of plating to do it, but I'm struggling to fill this obnoxious gap down the center line and it's hard to do given it's not constantly parallel. If anyone has any ideas that would be great.
help 2022-10-05 18:42:33 No, I'm doing .5 - .2 width.
creations-chat 2022-10-05 22:45:00 My man, it looks nothing a-like, notice the fact that the space engineers one is completely different in size, but sure, fake af.🗿🗿
