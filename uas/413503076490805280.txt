The Tale of ac77w (413503076490805280)
creations-chat 2019-06-10 19:38:12 My odd looking gunship. 462 blocks, max cruise speed of 491 sps
creations-chat 2019-06-10 19:38:51 i agree
creations-chat 2019-06-10 19:43:47 true
creations-chat 2019-06-10 19:44:35 ok thanks
creations-chat 2019-06-10 20:01:38 This is less shit than the gunship. Granted, thats setting the bar pretty low.
creations-chat 2019-06-11 22:06:32 My first attempt of a circular fuselage. 726 parts, max cruise speed of 574 sps.

creations-chat 2019-06-11 22:39:08 here is a less crappy screenshot of the plane
creations-chat 2019-06-12 04:10:13 Name: Block, Blocks: 1, Max Cruise Speed: 0 sps
creations-chat 2019-06-12 04:15:59 the fact that this got 1 upvote makes it my most liked creation
creations-chat 2019-06-12 12:28:47 if i actually posted a block, does it look like i care how unoriginal it is?
creations-chat 2019-06-12 13:26:34 well, idk what it considered "good" and what is considered "bad"
creations-chat 2019-06-12 13:27:23 the block got 7 upvotes, but the first pic of the train before it got just 4, but the train was so much more complex then the block
creations-chat 2019-06-12 13:28:04 i just don't really understand how this works
creations-chat 2019-06-12 13:28:45 ik that, but why did it get more upvotes, its didn't deserve them
creations-chat 2019-06-12 13:28:56 that train deserves more upvotes than the block
creations-chat 2019-06-12 13:30:32 alright
creations-chat 2019-06-12 13:34:42 well i guess that throws the yf-12 i was working on out the window...
creations-chat 2019-06-12 13:37:21 alright, i'm just concerned because the block got more upvotes than my 700+ block jet, but yeah, it sound better to not care about upvotes
creations-chat 2019-06-12 13:38:20 oh
creations-chat 2019-06-12 13:39:17 well, i guess i will build the yf-12 then
creations-chat 2019-06-12 13:41:30 <:thconking:535171057649188865>
creations-chat 2019-06-12 13:43:25 well if you win in a looser competition, are you a winner of a looser?
creations-chat 2019-06-13 16:20:09 I tried to make a lockheed yf-12 and I somehow ended up with this. It has 588 blocks and cruises at 630 sps
creations-chat 2019-06-13 16:20:17 
creations-chat 2019-06-13 16:20:28 
creations-chat 2019-06-13 16:44:03 the yf-12 was an interceptor based on the a-12
creations-chat 2019-06-13 16:44:12 the program was cancelled though
creations-chat 2019-06-13 16:45:24 in the end, only 3 were built
creations-chat 2019-06-13 17:10:03 idk what the "pain" part of that means but sure i'll paint it
creations-chat 2019-06-13 17:14:55 also it doesn't have any weapons yet because idk where they put  them in real life
creations-chat 2019-06-13 17:26:51 alright
creations-chat 2019-06-13 18:25:59 I'm on a mission to get 100 downvotes
creations-chat 2019-06-13 18:30:03 Thank you
creations-chat 2019-06-13 19:43:17 Here is the YF-12A again, painted this time
creations-chat 2019-06-13 19:43:51 
creations-chat 2019-06-13 19:47:14 if you look at a top view of the yf-12a in real life, you can see that the fuselage really spreads out just after the cockpit. but i kind of struggled to make that on this
creations-chat 2019-06-13 19:59:46 yeah i was thinking the same thing, i definitely built it way too small
creations-chat 2019-06-13 20:03:49 i don't really want to change it now though because surprisingly, it works quite well, making sharp turns are stuff like that
creations-chat 2019-06-13 20:04:47 oof
creations-chat 2019-06-13 20:06:50 next step is to weaponize it i guess
creations-chat 2019-06-13 21:31:38 oof someone thought my yf-12 is a b52
creations-chat 2019-06-13 22:40:01 wow
creations-chat 2019-06-14 02:05:40 why was the heli removed from creations?
creations-chat 2019-06-14 02:06:27 oh ok
creations-chat 2019-06-14 16:19:40 What if you downvote yourself?
creations-chat 2019-06-14 16:20:25 Ok good, reaching my goal of 100 downvotes will be easier than expected...
creations-chat 2019-06-14 18:33:44 it looks pretty good
help 2019-06-16 15:37:10 Greetings. My YF-12A used to fly perfectly. I haven't changed it at all, but now it just pitches down after takeoff. What do i do about this?
help 2019-06-16 15:43:13 Normally when this happens to any of my aircraft, I stop the plane and then spawn it again, and it will then work. This time, even after I do spawn it again, it just can't fly. It immediately nosedives
help 2019-06-16 16:39:04 i built it 2-3 days ago
help 2019-06-16 17:17:22 this is getting more odd, the yf-12a only works sometimes
help 2019-06-16 17:25:52 as in, sometimes after spawning, it works just like it used to, but other times, it will nosedive
help 2019-06-16 17:32:39 well, sometimes my other planes also pitch down at takeoff, so i respawn them and they work fine
help 2019-06-16 18:15:33 Here are the lift and mass nodes, as i said though, it was able to fly perfectly before
help 2019-06-16 18:16:57 well, i've learned how to fix it: I have to leave the server and join another one
help 2019-06-16 18:28:59 sorry, and yes i know that the nodes are far away from eachother, but despite that, the plane could fly before
help 2019-06-16 18:31:22 the picture i showed when i presented the problem proves that
help 2019-06-16 18:32:24 but if that were the case, i wouldn't be pitching down in one server, leave, and have it suddenly work like it should once i join another server
help 2019-06-16 18:34:08 i think we probably won't figure out the cause, but at least i now know that going to another server is how to stop it
help 2019-06-16 18:40:15 alright
help 2019-06-16 18:43:13 Sorry its in the night again, but here is a screenshot of it happening
help 2019-06-16 18:50:00 Alright, I got 2 day screenshots
help 2019-06-16 18:50:08 
help 2019-06-16 18:51:10 no
help 2019-06-16 18:51:27 alright i'll try that now
help 2019-06-16 18:53:40 i understand that, what i don't understand is why it happens only sometimes, and how come i have to leave the server and join another to finally make it work, because it works most of the time
help 2019-06-16 18:55:46 i guess that must be it
help 2019-06-16 19:00:10 with wing panels on the nose, its pretty much the same as when the plane works normally btw
creations-chat 2019-06-16 21:13:25 what a tragedy

help 2019-06-24 19:27:30 i'm making a boxwing business jet and the control surfaces powered by motors sometimes disappear in flight, causing the plane to become uncontrollable. is that a normal issue with the motors?
help 2019-06-24 19:29:43 i'd assume it is because it happens with my crj as well
help 2019-06-24 20:58:43 oh ok
creations-chat 2019-06-25 01:18:48 you got 7 downvotes against 12 upvotes

creations-chat 2019-06-25 18:46:01 because motors
creations-chat 2019-06-25 18:46:28 yep, it took a lot of time to get it stable
creations-chat 2019-06-25 18:47:19 alright
creations-chat 2019-06-25 18:47:58 its supposed to be a better version of a terrible boxwing i made a long time ago when i just started playing
creations-chat 2019-06-25 18:48:52 oh i see what your talking about
creations-chat 2019-06-25 18:49:09 thanks
creations-chat 2019-06-25 22:36:34 I managed to stabilize the plane so I could remove some of the wings and all of the ballast blocks, giving some room for retractable landing gear. Now 1116 blocks.
creations-chat 2019-06-25 22:37:52

creations-chat 2019-07-17 20:29:30 777 is better than 747
creations-chat 2019-07-17 20:29:40 it is true
creations-chat 2019-07-17 20:30:15 it will be easier if you use blueprints though
creations-chat 2019-07-17 20:30:37 just search up "747-100 diagram"

help 2019-07-26 03:49:36 also the center of lift is aligned with the center of mass
