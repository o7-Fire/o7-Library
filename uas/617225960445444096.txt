creations-chat 2020-09-18 08:11:11 Aight, thanks.
creations-chat 2020-09-18 08:12:59 Oh
creations-chat 2020-09-18 08:12:59 I made the back hover thruster the same level
https://gyazo.com/a429248651cf2485fb51bde73e930aab
creations-chat 2020-09-18 08:13:18 Alright
creations-chat 2020-09-18 08:13:31 let me try making it like that, then making the hover servo thingy
creations-chat 2020-09-18 08:15:01 Oh nice
creations-chat 2020-09-18 08:15:03 I'll try that
creations-chat 2020-09-18 08:18:27 What should the max angle be?
creations-chat 2020-09-18 08:18:39 Aight
creations-chat 2020-09-18 08:19:59 what i have right now
creations-chat 2020-09-18 08:20:46 Should it be the other way around?
creations-chat 2020-09-18 08:23:21 well
creations-chat 2020-09-18 08:23:22 Uhh
creations-chat 2020-09-18 08:23:36 it is possible to steer with this
creations-chat 2020-09-18 08:24:18 but it's kinda hard
creations-chat 2020-09-18 08:24:50 and steering to the left is kinda broken
creations-chat 2020-09-18 08:24:51 Yeah
creations-chat 2020-09-18 08:25:26 ok I adjusted the angle, steering to the left is fine.
creations-chat 2020-09-18 08:26:34 https://gyazo.com/dc715da152e9e9153b61f4aaa3f7e386
creations-chat 2020-09-18 08:27:41 atleast it steers
creations-chat 2020-09-18 08:28:24 Steering while driving's a mess, though.
creations-chat 2020-09-18 08:29:04 Should it be located at the seat?
creations-chat 2020-09-18 08:29:13 I intended it to be bulky on the front
creations-chat 2020-09-18 08:29:15 so it leans forward
creations-chat 2020-09-18 08:29:18 and gives more speed.
creations-chat 2020-09-18 08:31:16 here's footage of steering
https://gyazo.com/538049b48c7253dd7bbe77eaff1a0802
creations-chat 2020-09-18 08:31:51 it does occasionally
creations-chat 2020-09-18 08:31:57 but that's when it's fast
creations-chat 2020-09-18 08:32:08 Also, here's the center of mass here.
creations-chat 2020-09-18 08:32:14 Alright, thanks.
creations-chat 2020-09-18 08:33:35 Oh wait
creations-chat 2020-09-18 08:33:42 it rolls over when it hits something fast
creations-chat 2020-09-18 08:33:57 or goes on bumpy land
creations-chat 2020-09-18 08:35:13 Alright
creations-chat 2020-09-18 08:35:36 Lowered it
creations-chat 2020-09-18 08:36:04 Turning is slower now
creations-chat 2020-09-18 08:37:22 Is there a slower engine I could use?
creations-chat 2020-09-18 08:38:30 Alright
creations-chat 2020-09-18 08:52:42 Made something new, I guess.
creations-chat 2020-09-18 08:52:44 <@!714763671410180127> nice
creations-chat 2020-09-18 08:56:50 try to make it that there's a propeller on front
creations-chat 2020-09-18 08:57:06 well
creations-chat 2020-09-18 08:57:13 you certainly did mess up
creations-chat 2020-09-18 08:57:15 I guess
creations-chat 2020-09-18 08:58:03 that's what i did with this
creations-chat 2020-09-18 08:58:13 Pretty fast and flies well
creations-chat 2020-09-18 08:59:23 Turning speed is moderate
creations-chat 2020-09-18 08:59:30 let me check the speed
creations-chat 2020-09-18 08:59:43 150 highest
creations-chat 2020-09-18 08:59:46 pretty low
creations-chat 2020-09-18 08:59:50 but handles well
creations-chat 2020-09-18 09:00:24 Frick, I gotta improve
creations-chat 2020-09-18 09:03:43 Beat this
creations-chat 2020-09-18 09:05:18 yeah
creations-chat 2020-09-18 09:05:28 I'll get rid of the propellers entirely
creations-chat 2020-09-18 09:05:35 And add reversed ets
creations-chat 2020-09-18 09:05:37 jets
creations-chat 2020-09-18 09:07:01 Power.

creations-chat 2020-09-18 09:08:31 Well

creations-chat 2020-09-18 09:09:11 I'm adding bombs to it and making it a suicide bomber plane
creations-chat 2020-09-18 09:29:48 Experiment thingy

creations-chat 2020-09-18 09:31:28 It'd be nice
creations-chat 2020-09-18 09:32:13 <@!685909594932773033> By mecha thingy, I just meant something that shoots and moves

creations-chat 2020-09-18 09:33:54 frick
creations-chat 2020-09-18 09:34:47 It'd be nice to be able to script a set of commands when you press a key in plane crazy
creations-chat 2020-09-18 09:35:04 not really Lua
creations-chat 2020-09-18 09:35:30 Well
creations-chat 2020-09-18 09:35:42 Maybe when you want something to basically reveal itself
creations-chat 2020-09-18 09:35:49 since it's being covered by a bunch of pistons
creations-chat 2020-09-18 09:35:54 or something I don't know

creations-chat 2020-09-19 10:47:11 Do you use magnets when making guns?
creations-chat 2020-09-19 10:47:49 Do you also use explosives for the bullet?
creations-chat 2020-09-19 10:47:54 or just use cutters
creations-chat 2020-09-19 10:49:22 Explosive boolets, I see
creations-chat 2020-09-19 10:49:33 I'd rather use a cutter
creations-chat 2020-09-19 10:49:38 Much more accurate, I guess.
creations-chat 2020-09-19 10:50:39 Is smoll suspension ok?
creations-chat 2020-09-19 10:51:10 Seriously, if we had a smaller version of suspension
