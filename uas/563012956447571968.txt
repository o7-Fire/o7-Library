help 2023-05-14 08:21:51 what shall i do about my planes's rear wobbling at high speeds
help 2023-05-14 09:33:43 both fixed the issue, but made my plane slower by around 400-600 speed
help 2023-05-14 09:34:08 and made my plane tilt upwards
bot-central 2023-05-14 09:35:24 !rank
help 2023-05-14 11:11:05 it starts to wobble at around 2100 speed
help 2023-05-14 11:12:03 and it even tilts upwards when there's bonus wing panels on the front
help 2023-05-14 11:17:37 this is one of a few planes which it's rear wobble
help 2023-05-14 11:18:25 
help 2023-05-14 12:13:15 i also have a 400 block fighter jet which it's rear mega wobbles but i fixed the wobble by limiting the hover engines
help 2023-05-14 12:14:39 this
help 2023-05-14 12:15:46 it's top speed is limited to around 600-700 speed

help 2023-05-14 12:17:01 "should be a piece of cake"
help 2023-05-14 12:21:06 
help 2023-05-14 12:21:53 i think the problem is that they are "light"

creations-chat 2023-07-09 19:58:24 you are only saying it because i don't have the ranked role/rank
creations-chat 2023-07-09 20:50:02 no because of fold conserns
creations-chat 2023-07-09 21:00:59 this is the only thing that i would do to make it less square and the fold concern is the fold attachment thing
creations-chat 2023-07-09 21:16:58 but adding details is around very hard
creations-chat 2023-07-09 21:20:09 like there's almost no space for it and i even had to strip the green part of the shiphull to 3 blocks in height to make the fold work perfectly
help 2023-07-13 19:30:41 what landing gear shall i put on this

help 2023-07-14 17:25:49 idk at this kind of mig-21 f-13

help 2023-07-15 09:39:42 the vertical stabilizer?
help 2023-07-15 09:41:24 i somewhat fixed the vertical stabilizer after i posted it (my mig-21 is the f-13 version)
help 2023-07-15 09:42:18 shall i also move the vertical stabilizer 1 block backwards
help 2023-07-15 09:45:50 i think that if i move the elevators 1 block backwards, then it will break the angle lock
help 2023-07-15 10:12:18 
help 2023-07-15 10:14:07 i tried to make it look as it is in real life
help 2023-07-15 10:18:18 and there's no space to move it backwards
help 2023-07-15 10:20:13 this breaks the elevator (i mean the elevator merges with the exhaust and it makes the elevator not work)
help 2023-07-15 10:22:46 
help 2023-07-15 10:23:53 watch the video
help 2023-07-15 10:24:15 the elevator isn't working
help 2023-07-15 10:24:48 
help 2023-07-15 10:25:06 it merges with the exhaust
help 2023-07-15 10:25:48 yes
help 2023-07-15 10:27:27 if it would work, then it would be bad in looks
help 2023-07-15 10:29:50 i will now try with a redesigned exhaust
help 2023-07-15 10:39:35 is it good like this
help 2023-07-15 10:45:09 
help 2023-07-15 10:50:38 the main wing?
help 2023-07-15 10:55:44 there's 3 blocks between the main wings and the elevators yet
help 2023-07-15 10:56:15 and the main wing has realistic placing
help 2023-07-15 10:57:19 
help 2023-07-15 11:50:06 no, since i can't use sketchfab (because of somewhat of a "skill issue"), and i saw atleast 1 mig-21 f13 in person
help 2023-07-15 12:05:41 which color looks the best for this
help 2023-07-15 12:26:43 i meant the nose cone color (and the main camo wanted to be the metal camo)
help 2023-07-15 12:28:26 this kind of metal camo
help 2023-07-15 12:29:57 that is very too dark for it
help 2023-07-15 12:31:48 it's color is 190 190 180 for now
help 2023-07-15 12:34:24 
help 2023-07-15 15:29:35 green or blue more accurately (idc that both of them are the same plane)
help 2023-07-15 17:27:36 how could i make this kind of decals
help 2023-07-15 17:38:09 what about the icon of the 101st air squadron in the front of the mig-21
help 2023-07-15 17:47:02 is this somewhat good if i wanted to represent that squadron
help 2023-07-15 18:15:50 and the huaf insignia might be not possible to put together because only the red triangle would be visible
help 2023-07-15 18:17:08 i know it when i tried to do this screenshot since this required good timing because the red circle makes the puma emoji not visible

help 2023-07-16 10:47:49 which of these window color is the best for it
help 2023-07-16 10:50:42 so the darker one
help 2023-07-16 10:51:45 and does the windows make the ship look better
help 2023-07-16 10:53:27 and it will be somewhat similar to this, or it will be a passenger ship/ocean liner
help 2023-07-16 10:57:09 shall i also use this to the ship
help 2023-07-16 10:58:23 and what will be with the railing if i use that, and i don't want to use and other motorlock to it
help 2023-07-16 10:59:55 you need lvl 3
help 2023-07-16 11:00:21 so i should use other motorlocks
help 2023-07-16 11:03:00 
help 2023-07-16 11:05:17 motorlocking from the sides is not possible, also, it would be better if you saw the build ingame
