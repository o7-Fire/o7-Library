The Tale of VideoCarp (508763131879882767)
help 2020-03-28 11:18:43 <@!308156968550268928> I think I’m supposed to ping you for this, if not sorry. Here’s the proof, I found no other way to get it, so I posted it in the reddit. Notice that 3 parts fall off, but it’s still above 500. I’m also a bad driver u can see with my joystick, sorry for that.

bug-reports 2020-03-29 03:43:06 On mobile, when you click, all guns on the vehicle would shoot, which is fine, but after a bit while you’re in the server, or have shot a specified amount of bullets from the gun, it COMPLETELY stops shooting.

help 2020-03-29 23:54:20 no one will help me.
help 2020-03-29 23:54:28 because of weight.
help 2020-03-29 23:54:32 cuz no one takes the seat
help 2020-03-29 23:55:00 yes but no.
help 2020-03-29 23:55:07 all sides are symmetrical.
help 2020-03-29 23:55:27 inside of the pilot seat I think
help 2020-03-29 23:55:49 yes kind of
help 2020-03-29 23:56:03 It’s in front of them in this image.
help 2020-03-29 23:57:32 Centre of mass is somewhere near the highlighted area.
help 2020-03-29 23:57:39 the yellow lines.
help 2020-03-29 23:57:53 k
help 2020-03-29 23:58:16 center of mass or seat?

help 2020-03-30 00:00:08 
help 2020-03-30 00:00:32 so add max density ballast blocks?
help 2020-03-30 00:01:26 thing is
help 2020-03-30 00:01:27 thing is
help 2020-03-30 00:01:30 i’m blind now.
help 2020-03-30 00:05:53 Does 1 beam weigh more than 4 blocks?
help 2020-03-30 00:08:25 how do u even make a guided missile and what is a guided missile?
help 2020-03-30 00:09:29 Wait.
help 2020-03-30 00:09:33 what
help 2020-03-30 00:09:40 is it explosive blocks?
help 2020-03-30 00:11:07 nice
help 2020-03-30 00:12:01 If only were we allowed to add helium to lower weight on a side.
help 2020-03-30 00:12:09 ballast blocks are too weak.w
help 2020-03-30 00:14:24 GRAVITY is broken.
help 2020-03-30 00:14:34 All sides were perfectly equilateral.
help 2020-03-30 00:14:50 I even added a helium beam.
help 2020-03-30 00:15:06 this is kinda like weight on a huge ship..
help 2020-03-30 00:15:48 Hey wait a second, what’s apply at centre?
help 2020-03-30 00:17:38 I am an idiot.
help 2020-03-30 00:20:15 WEIGHT IS BROKEN
help 2020-03-30 00:20:26 I’m thinking
help 2020-03-30 00:20:31 of removing the ballasts
help 2020-03-30 00:20:44 and adding a huge rocket engine inside of the thing....
help 2020-03-30 00:22:53 ok what blocks add the most weight?
help 2020-03-30 00:23:57 what blocks add the most weight?
help 2020-03-30 00:30:40 MY CENTRE OF MASS IS locked.
help 2020-03-30 00:30:59 do I really have to
help 2020-03-30 00:31:05 make an entire booster
help 2020-03-30 00:31:09 on max density?
help 2020-03-30 00:36:06 OH MY GOD!
help 2020-03-30 00:36:08 WHY!
help 2020-03-30 00:36:22 MY GRAVITY IS ON NEGATIVE OR WHAT!
help 2020-03-30 00:36:56 placing things that weigh a lot pattern
HERE moves the centre of mass HERE
help 2020-03-30 00:37:29 It just makes no sense...
help 2020-03-30 00:37:36 I add ballast blocks to the front
help 2020-03-30 00:37:40 and the back now weighs more?
help 2020-03-30 00:37:46 what is wrong with this?
help 2020-03-30 00:38:47 I’m not joking when I say it feels like gravity has an exact opposite value.
help 2020-03-30 00:39:42 and helium pulls things back.
help 2020-03-30 00:44:57 Yeah now I get the centre of mass perfect and it TURNS OUT THE CENTRE OF MASS does not work and is dyslexic.
help 2020-03-30 00:48:12 no the centre of mass
help 2020-03-30 00:48:20 is indeed autistic and dyslexic.
help 2020-03-30 00:48:26 this thing isn’t even possible to make anymore
help 2020-03-30 00:48:54 how on shit am I supposed to know where the centre of mass is, when it’s dyslexic before-launch and then it actually works normally when I launch?
help 2020-03-30 00:49:37 now it doesn’t even fly when it has 16 LARGE ROCKET ENGINES!
help 2020-03-30 00:49:59 IN 4 BOOSTERS.
help 2020-03-30 00:51:17 NO!
help 2020-03-30 00:51:40 now it weighs too much on the other damn side.
help 2020-03-30 00:52:46 I don’t care if it can pitch or yaw, I just want it to go UP NOT DOWN.
help 2020-03-30 01:12:20 My rocket is not moving upwards.
help 2020-03-30 01:12:31 
help 2020-03-30 01:12:50 It’s got 16 large rocket engines, what can I possibly add
help 2020-03-30 01:13:09 I press flip, it flies for 0.0002 seconds and goes up 1 meter and falls back down.
help 2020-03-30 01:13:17 Super engines are stronger than large?
help 2020-03-30 01:13:44 so if I add ones in the boosters, it may fly?
help 2020-03-30 01:13:58 there are gaps.
help 2020-03-30 01:15:55 <@!671156550546751550> It flies like 500 speed now from 0, but it goes to a random corner, I cannot fix with weight, so how can I make it kind of controllable?
help 2020-03-30 01:16:34 or do I use “Flip”
help 2020-03-30 01:16:55 flip does not work.
help 2020-03-30 01:17:53 What type of control surfaces do I use?
help 2020-03-30 01:18:59 Got 507 parts on t.
help 2020-03-30 01:19:00 it*
help 2020-03-30 01:23:30 no
help 2020-03-30 01:23:38 it cannot pitch, nor yaw.
help 2020-03-30 01:24:07 who knows where or what kind of control surfaces I need on a rocket?
help 2020-03-30 01:33:55 Yes I hit the speed of light!
help 2020-03-30 01:38:51 rip I didn’t.
help 2020-03-30 01:40:16 how do I make a rope glitcher

help 2020-03-30 01:47:19 my motor doesn’t work.
help 2020-03-30 01:47:26 <@600750947035119621> I’m sure that’s what I did.
help 2020-03-30 01:47:51 Not all, just one.
help 2020-03-30 01:48:04 random one.
help 2020-03-30 01:48:15 preferably one with online status.
help 2020-03-30 01:48:29 k
help 2020-03-30 01:48:40 k I gotta work on my glitcher bye.

help 2020-03-30 11:16:49 
help 2020-03-30 11:19:08 I’m planning to use parachutes in a way to simulate gravity being low so the thing can stay in the air for longer.
help 2020-03-30 11:24:23 Nvm, I know what the problem is now,
help 2020-03-30 11:24:24 but
help 2020-03-30 11:24:32 how do I make it pitch and yaw?
help 2020-03-30 11:30:12 What do you mean rocket engine?
help 2020-03-30 11:30:28 I have at least 16 large rocket engines, and 12 super rocket engines..
creations-chat 2020-03-30 11:57:51 Here’s a space rocket that I have made, it has detachable boosters, and there’s a special part about it, I though that parachutes at the top can be used to simulate lower gravity. As someone who doesn’t colour very well, I’m proud of the design, even though it’s still bad.
help 2020-03-30 11:58:25 k
help 2020-03-30 11:58:28 anyway I need help
help 2020-03-30 11:58:34 I tried to put 2 attachments
help 2020-03-30 11:58:45 in a creation submission, but it pasted 2 submissions instead
creations-chat 2020-03-30 11:58:57 why did it paste 2 in <#384025409945337856>
help 2020-03-30 12:01:02 they don’t work.
help 2020-03-30 12:01:08 anyway I’m fine now
