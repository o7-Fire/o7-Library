creations-chat 2018-12-21 10:22:20 I think you might wanna show your creation too, along with the speed in the same image
creations-chat 2018-12-21 10:23:22 Not exactly what i'm asking for
creations-chat 2018-12-21 10:23:51 Besides i'm not actually a mod, i'm only notifying
creations-chat 2018-12-21 10:25:23 Did you eject vertically?
creations-chat 2018-12-21 10:25:45 Hmmm
creations-chat 2018-12-21 10:26:36 Well, the reason why ejecting vertically isn't allowed is because of how easy it is to get speed with helium, but this is different as you're using a glitch and a spring
creations-chat 2018-12-21 10:26:54 I hope its allowed
