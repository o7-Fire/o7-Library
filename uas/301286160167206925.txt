creations-chat 2019-10-04 19:04:43 It has relatively realistic suspension which i had to compress a lot to fit in
creations-chat 2019-10-04 19:04:49 tracks could not fit
creations-chat 2019-10-04 19:07:14 each one of these is a suspension bogie that rocks front to back
creations-chat 2019-10-04 19:07:55 the middle suspension is connected, but the outer ones are not, but instead push up against the top
