creations-chat 2020-06-17 18:43:50 <@!708064765770989568> What is the reason you downvoted? Anything I should work on?
creations-chat 2020-06-17 18:45:25 I mean, I searched for his mentions, everyone was saying that he downvotes every creation instantly.
creations-chat 2020-06-17 18:45:36 But, I think he's changed, right?
creations-chat 2020-06-17 18:45:59 Pretty accurate to the reference photo

creations-chat 2020-06-17 18:48:28 It's legit that wide to store spacecraft on the deck.
creations-chat 2020-06-17 18:49:02 And to, you know, be a BATTLEcruiser and store as many guns as it can fit.

creations-chat 2020-06-19 08:49:37 But I do need some help with the frontal guns
creations-chat 2020-06-19 08:49:49 
creations-chat 2020-06-19 08:50:46 It's hard to make them since they are so small.
creations-chat 2020-06-19 08:51:11 It wouldn't be a problem if they were AA turrets. I could've just slapped some guns on them and it would've been fine.
creations-chat 2020-06-19 08:51:35 But from what it looks like, it seems they are missile launchers of sorts.
creations-chat 2020-06-19 08:53:59 I don't know how to ;-;
creations-chat 2020-06-19 09:03:18 I tried motorlocking once with two half blocks. Plan was to merge them.

creations-chat 2021-03-12 07:36:51 And a clear side cuz 1, it looks cool and 2 it adds stuff to the build
~~also because you can see inside and my time wasn't wasted~~
creations-chat 2021-03-12 07:40:04 Sus?!
creations-chat 2021-03-12 08:51:04 <@!625224427369660416> the uh, part of the lightsaber that makes it a crossguard is uh, they're a tad too long, shorten it and it should look better
creations-chat 2021-03-12 09:08:00 Yeah, you could work on pictures a bit more, on the other hand I wish I could build like that!
creations-chat 2021-03-12 09:11:05 Well try to show as much of the build with as many details as you can fit, so if you took the same picture a bit more to the left and from the very bottom, there'd be a chance to get a cooler angle on it.
~~But then again I'm not a professional photographer so the info I gave you might just be crap.~~
creations-chat 2021-03-12 09:21:00 Well I'll always upvote mechs regardless of photo angles since 1, I can't build them and 2, I'd imagine this takes time and effort to build, which I don't have.
creations-chat 2021-03-12 09:23:31 Well the only mech I made was the cherno whatever it was called from Pacific Rim because I saw someone else build Gipsy danger. Well it didn't take long for me to realize that it was too top heavy because of details and I also had no idea how to stabilize it without screwing everything up.
On the other side, the fist could hit literally anything once and it could launch it across the map, so that's a plus.
creations-chat 2021-03-12 09:27:49 The waves left behind from a ship aren't that circular, It looks more like how you'd skip a rock on water.
creations-chat 2021-03-12 09:30:29 pain.
creations-chat 2021-03-12 09:33:05 Well people who play on mobile deserve both praise and hell.
Some spend time to create planes like <@!703429396475805756> does and create something cool while other just.... Uh. Well it's odd to say.
creations-chat 2021-03-12 09:35:27 Now we only need a kaiju maker
creations-chat 2021-03-12 09:41:55 I am making a similar thing to what <@!740520273073274961> did, basically a big cannon but on rails. Did that just to make my pain eternal
creations-chat 2021-03-12 16:27:53 Back to what tank said, I wont copy it and I assure you of it because 1, I have no model of what you built and 2, you need separate designs for railways and land, while you made it to probably go over rough terrain my model will only go forward and backward with some difficulty around corners while I also try to make it not look like absolute garbage.
To summarize, I am too trash to copy you.
creations-chat 2021-03-12 17:31:37 he means uh, before the dome.
creations-chat 2021-03-12 17:36:44 also I added train suspension! It's a discount version, sure, only 2 unpowered motors but hey, at least my railway monster doesn't look like a stiff icicle going up a ramp!
