creations-chat 2022-07-17 00:19:58 Needs to be more wider and bigger I think, air intakes? Would make it look much cooler and realistic.

contest-chat 2022-09-14 20:55:13 Nvm ainc eyou dont speak engineer, what im saying is that there is a limit to what you can do in the game atm.
contest-chat 2022-09-14 20:55:41 In what way tho?
contest-chat 2022-09-14 20:55:46 Explain
contest-chat 2022-09-14 20:56:51 Wym?
contest-chat 2022-09-14 20:56:59 They look perfect to me
contest-chat 2022-09-14 20:58:50 The wings are fine what are you on about?
contest-chat 2022-09-14 20:59:12 The only difference is the sides of the intakes

contest-chat 2022-09-14 21:02:47 :>
contest-chat 2022-09-14 21:03:02 no
contest-chat 2022-09-14 21:03:30 Anyways
contest-chat 2022-09-14 21:04:36 Coming from a guy who judges every much everyones work and cries about a simple detail not being right üíÄ
contest-chat 2022-09-14 21:04:52 I rest that case
contest-chat 2022-09-14 21:05:07 Anyways I habe better things to do than carry this on ngl.
contest-chat 2022-09-14 21:05:27 Bro you are making no sense üíÄ
contest-chat 2022-09-14 21:05:39 You have no point.
contest-chat 2022-09-14 21:06:03 How am I?
contest-chat 2022-09-14 21:06:51 Sure, one thing though.
contest-chat 2022-09-14 21:08:46 What I was saying, is that you dont need to be judgemental over someones jet design, I dont even see wym about wing placement. It looks fine to me, the only 2 things he could improve is the cockpit and the air intakes, apart from that I think it is quite close to the real thing.
contest-chat 2022-09-14 21:09:23 Mhm, whatever.
contest-chat 2022-09-14 21:09:58 You said about wing placement
contest-chat 2022-09-14 21:10:06 üíÄ
contest-chat 2022-09-14 21:10:23 no?
contest-chat 2022-09-14 21:11:01 I was making a point of my idea of the situation
contest-chat 2022-09-14 21:12:46 Not the same point of your view, I just looked at it carefully to see what you could find sk weong about it.
contest-chat 2022-09-14 21:14:17 It is a user?
contest-chat 2022-09-14 21:14:48 ?
contest-chat 2022-09-14 21:15:03 I didn't say it was impossible but ok.
contest-chat 2022-09-14 21:15:53 Maybe because someone has started it again?
contest-chat 2022-09-14 21:16:14 At this point
contest-chat 2022-09-14 21:16:22 I really dont care üíÄ
contest-chat 2022-09-14 21:17:08 I was making a point, there is a certain extent to where you can and cant make things that realistic.
contest-chat 2022-09-14 21:17:16 Thats all.
contest-chat 2022-09-14 21:18:10 Explain where tho
contest-chat 2022-09-14 21:18:15 Honesty
contest-chat 2022-09-14 21:18:28 I dont see what is wrong with it
contest-chat 2022-09-14 21:18:42 ........
contest-chat 2022-09-14 21:18:45 Wait a sec
contest-chat 2022-09-14 21:19:55 I see that ngl, but still it does look really good.
contest-chat 2022-09-14 21:21:29 Im guessing a massive motor locked fighter jet would be better for you?
contest-chat 2022-09-14 21:21:57 Is that what you are saying?
contest-chat 2022-09-14 21:23:07 Tbh that would be able to let you get more better detail, I would of thought the detail would be much difficult, since you are trying to copy every little detail of the jet.
contest-chat 2022-09-14 21:24:42 Alr
contest-chat 2022-09-14 21:25:38 Sheesh
contest-chat 2022-09-14 21:25:44 The detail though
contest-chat 2022-09-15 07:54:26 Isnt even my build, but ok lol.
creations-chat 2022-11-04 00:19:52 If anyone has any ideas on what I could add to the steam tractor, let me know.
creations-chat 2022-11-04 00:23:08 üíÄ looks like im converting it into a dragster then
creations-chat 2022-11-04 00:31:56 Yh, im still figuring that out
creations-chat 2022-11-04 14:46:51 Hey man, I've done what you wanted me to improve on and I have updated a few things since the main piston itself was too big (literally thought it was gonna be hard even though it was ez) anything else you think I should work on?
creations-chat 2022-11-04 14:50:02 Wtf?
creations-chat 2022-11-04 22:33:15 Ngl, I was having a hissy fit with the piston for ages, all I had to do was change 4 blocks

creations-chat 2023-05-30 19:36:01 Sup. (What did I just walk into lol)
creations-chat 2023-05-30 19:40:55 What did you make? Just curious.
creations-chat 2023-05-30 19:48:25 True tbh, however I think what he was trying to put into words is that some people seem to give more than harsh criticism then they need to, if it is a complete utter trash with no effort into it then yk it makes sense, however when you see people put actual effort into their builds there isnt any need to tell them basically they are garbage in every prospective. (I was just saying what I think Dav_DidYT was tryna say, not to sound rude or anything to ya bro if it comes that wayüëç)
creations-chat 2023-05-31 22:04:40 I will give you huge credit, that is the smallest A-10 I have ever seen. (Idk myself on how you could make that better, it looks as detailed as you can get it in my opinion)
creations-chat 2023-06-06 19:24:57 Welcome to pc, lol.
creations-chat 2023-06-06 19:31:51 I dont really play this game as much anymore tbh lol, it breaks more and more as roblox updates, there isn't no hope for a game that doesn't have a clear development team that cannot respond properly to their own fanbase, Im not pitying anybody, however most people here will admit that devs that don't keep their player-base up to date will unfortunately fail to become a successful game, as less players will just seem to care overtime and will just move on, take dragon ball z final stand 2 for example. (If any of you know what that is)
creations-chat 2023-06-06 19:41:36 I agree with that tbh.
creations-chat 2023-06-06 19:46:36 (This is my old img but ill just role with it)  Should I add a motor locked boiler or keep the original?
creations-chat 2023-06-06 19:49:01 This is literally the only thing I work on from time to time lol.
