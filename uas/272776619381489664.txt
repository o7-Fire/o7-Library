plane-crazy 2020-06-28 04:31:09 and i have to rebuild a bunch of shit
plane-crazy 2020-06-28 04:31:03 cause there is several times where a half block messes up my entire thing
plane-crazy 2020-06-28 04:30:48 The way half blocks are is shitty
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 10:06:53 the instant moment i spawn anything above 200 blocks in the water?
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 10:06:43 why does my game lag
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 06:51:36 man i hate building certain things
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 06:40:44 doesnt really say how but okay
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 06:39:45 how
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 06:39:23 for real?
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 06:38:57 just asking

plane-crazy 2020-06-27 06:37:59 yamato???
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 06:34:10 that should burn in hell
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 06:34:05 i made a super shitty turret
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 06:11:25 i dont understand but ok
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 06:10:36 bruh nobody ever gonna say what it does by this point

plane-crazy 2020-06-27 06:06:23 nah sorry
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 05:58:20 so what happend
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 05:52:33 probally
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 05:52:23 cuz of traffic jams and people blocking the rails
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 05:51:00 ill think about it
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 05:47:35 and i know like nothing about the war
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 05:47:30 im not that good at building
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 05:46:24 maybe
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 05:45:42 what contest?
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 05:41:13 i only blacklist when im building stuff in pvp
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 05:40:38 it seems kinda broken
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 05:39:28 so i made a cutter plane and i literally just flew through their vehicle and split it in half instantly
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 05:39:02 i blacklisted someone once because they kept going into my base
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 05:38:54 well
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 05:38:41 if you blacklist someone you can go through them right?
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 05:38:33 also
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 05:37:38 inorder for it to do damage
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 05:37:33 so i need to sit on the cutter
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 05:36:48 but it doesnt work because the cutters dont do damage
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 05:36:37 that sends cutters out at ridiculous speed
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 05:36:31 i wanted to make this spring thing
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 05:35:38 yes please
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 05:35:18 and a couple of wings
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 05:35:10 my drone made out of pure explosives
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 05:35:06 yea
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 05:33:52 and i blew this guy up like 5 times in a row lol
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 05:33:29 i had this drone thingy
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 05:32:53 and he made it even more shit
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 05:32:49 someone copied one of my shitty designs
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 05:32:12 then guns are
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 05:32:10 lava is more balanced
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 05:30:52 you cant protect against it either
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 05:30:42 its literally just lasers
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 05:30:17 ngl
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 05:30:16 guns in the game are pretty bad
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 05:29:07 you should paint it green
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 05:28:41 thats better then all of my creations
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 05:28:05 sure
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 05:27:49 i guess i could try making a tiger because its literally just a box
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 05:27:35 i want to make tanks but my building skills arent the greatest
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 05:26:56 that sounds very epic
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 05:26:46 500mm shell with HE blowing up kids from the water
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 05:26:05 in the game
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 05:25:56 imagine naval cannons
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 05:24:58 imagine watching all the kids cry when a dude rolls up with 2 40 mm bofors cannons
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 05:24:01 yeah
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 05:23:34 lol
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 05:23:33 imagine a 40 mm bofors in the game
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 05:23:04 it would be so satisfying blowing peoples shitty planes out of the sky with HE shells
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 05:22:48 that theres no real tank barrle parts
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 05:22:43 its sad
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 05:18:29 but the problem is using them to turn
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 05:18:25 i know you can use them
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 05:17:29 it would be gucci
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 05:17:27 if conveyors could be used as actual tank tracks
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 05:15:18 all my turrets are ugly as hell cause of how i have to build the motors
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 05:12:56 how do you make a compact turret?
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 03:56:37 what does locked motors do?
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 03:41:18 also glass can make you see through water
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 03:39:23 im dissapointed in cutters
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 03:39:08 very epic
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 03:38:13 i could make one go like 200 speed and it wont do damage
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 03:37:47 cutters seem broken in some ways
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 03:01:02 man springs suck
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 02:54:52 i was using suspension
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 02:54:50 i never saw the actual spring
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 02:54:41 im stupid
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 02:54:39 nvm
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 02:48:51 is there someway to pull back a spring without using ropes and thrusters?
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 02:43:46 thank you
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 02:43:45 very epic
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 02:41:26 does that include your vehicle?
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 02:37:34 on explosives
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 02:37:31 what does the ignore self button do?
plane-crazy 2020-06-26 08:50:34 epic
plane-crazy 2020-06-26 08:41:00 is there anyway to make a semi decent sight with a camera?
plane-crazy 2020-06-26 08:25:47 wtf have i made
plane-crazy 2020-06-26 08:23:33 what does it do??
plane-crazy 2020-06-26 08:22:48 what does it do
plane-crazy 2020-06-26 08:22:25 ?
plane-crazy 2020-06-26 08:22:21 what is that
plane-crazy 2020-06-26 08:05:32 ?
plane-crazy 2020-06-26 07:50:52 i would really like one for certain things
plane-crazy 2020-06-26 07:50:44 i hate that there is no weld tool
plane-crazy 2020-06-26 07:49:33 i wanted to make a 5 billion speed cutter that instantly cuts stuff in half
plane-crazy 2020-06-26 07:49:17 boring
plane-crazy 2020-06-26 07:42:20 what armor
plane-crazy 2020-06-26 07:40:53 how do you hit something with a 400 mph cutter without it doing anything
plane-crazy 2020-06-26 07:31:41 using propellers
plane-crazy 2020-06-26 07:30:09 yall think a rocket propelled cutter would do damage?
