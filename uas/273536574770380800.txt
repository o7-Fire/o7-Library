creations-chat 2020-09-23 12:40:46 actually, tank treads DO give benefits

creations-chat 2020-09-23 12:45:16 you model things from real life
creations-chat 2020-09-23 12:45:20 you should stick to how they made things
creations-chat 2020-09-23 12:45:50 we were talking about the benefits of treads
creations-chat 2020-09-23 12:46:06 i know
creations-chat 2020-09-23 12:46:38 why would you use treads for pvp
creations-chat 2020-09-23 12:46:48 that's just dumb
creations-chat 2020-09-23 12:47:04 they're not glitchy if you make them correctly
creations-chat 2020-09-23 12:47:11 and they're not that slow unless you make them gigantic
creations-chat 2020-09-23 12:48:12 also, different styles of treads can alter the physics throttle
creations-chat 2020-09-23 12:48:18 if you don't use that many motors, it'll lag less
creations-chat 2020-09-23 12:48:28 but in turn will make the ride less smooth
creations-chat 2020-09-23 12:49:04 also, to show just how easy it is to cross large gaps: https://gyazo.com/2b5c4d09d0d2ced80531d0cf1bb4e019
creations-chat 2020-09-23 12:49:53 no
creations-chat 2020-09-23 12:49:58 yes
creations-chat 2020-09-23 12:50:14 sometimes you can barely cross rails with only cylinders
creations-chat 2020-09-23 13:11:25 very easy actually
creations-chat 2020-09-23 13:13:21 that's only christie suspension
creations-chat 2020-09-23 13:13:30 some tanks didn't even use coils
creations-chat 2020-09-23 13:13:44 mm
creations-chat 2020-09-23 13:13:47 that's fine
creations-chat 2020-09-23 13:18:26 motor2s with low torque and 50 speed can act as suspension
creations-chat 2020-09-23 13:19:04 stuff like leafsprings bounce back immediately
creations-chat 2020-09-23 13:20:11 hmm
creations-chat 2020-09-23 13:20:17 i might need to conduct further testing
creations-chat 2020-09-23 13:20:28 but i've mostly always used 50 speed for motorized suspension
creations-chat 2020-09-23 13:21:52 https://gyazo.com/b01653e40c7bd1f23cab8213ba0bfb84
creations-chat 2020-09-23 13:21:58 i used 50 speed on this
creations-chat 2020-09-23 13:22:27 ^^ the only problem i can find with suspension above is that it can break when encountering too much force, causing the half wedges to just phase through the cylinder
creations-chat 2020-09-23 13:23:17 yeah
creations-chat 2020-09-23 13:23:52 yeah, you have a point
creations-chat 2020-09-23 13:25:04 depends on the amount of roadwheels
creations-chat 2020-09-23 13:25:11 if you have a lot, you'll probably need less
creations-chat 2020-09-23 13:25:34 i use 0.2 on the suspension above and i needed 8 ballast blocks on max to make it smoother
creations-chat 2020-09-23 13:26:08 what

creations-chat 2020-10-10 22:45:42 it works well = a great mechanical feat
creations-chat 2020-10-10 22:47:39 according to your logic
not seeing the katyusha means you wouldn't be able to distinguish if it looks like one or not
creations-chat 2020-10-10 22:48:34 yes

creations-chat 2020-10-10 23:35:54 oh yeah no i meant that to the people on the other side of this argument
creations-chat 2020-10-10 23:36:46 get it? it's because the flag displayed is also used as the flag for LGBTQ+ and it's implying that the people recieving it are gay
creations-chat 2020-10-10 23:37:46 change my mind: "better remove that self upvote" memes with deep fried images of creations were never funny
creations-chat 2020-10-10 23:38:57 finally, someone that agrees
creations-chat 2020-10-10 23:39:51 as much of a disgrace as it is, if you're not a mod then just ignore it

creations-chat 2020-10-10 23:41:34 oh yeah you can call it out, but straight up sending a mob after some fucking guy who decided to react with a green arrow is kind of like sending a first time felon to the gallows

creations-chat 2020-10-11 00:05:56 big christie suspension
creations-chat 2020-10-11 00:06:59 if i add weight it might sink deeper
creations-chat 2020-10-11 00:07:19 because i don't have any on it yet, also i have extra long spring
creations-chat 2020-10-11 00:09:12 sinke
creations-chat 2020-10-11 00:12:11 motorized suspension is pog too
creations-chat 2020-10-11 00:12:55 not that much actually
creations-chat 2020-10-11 00:13:40 if you optimize your tensioning and suspension you can get pretty surprising results
creations-chat 2020-10-11 00:13:57 the tighter the more laggier usually
creations-chat 2020-10-11 00:14:14 atleast that's what i felt with a small chassis
creations-chat 2020-10-11 00:14:59 if you use a sprocket wheel with decently saggy treads you can get up to 80% physics throttle
creations-chat 2020-10-11 00:15:41 speed incarnate https://gyazo.com/60c58e0ef1895842c0ce769973730f63
creations-chat 2020-10-11 00:17:08 people often think treads = your computer die but in reality it's probably because they made them too large / too tight
creations-chat 2020-10-11 00:18:23 if i tighten my treads fully this is how fast i go https://gyazo.com/96f960da8bf2dda14199f884c344301a
creations-chat 2020-10-11 00:18:40 but physics throttle also kicks in near the end of the clip
creations-chat 2020-10-11 00:19:21 IIRC roblox runs mostly on your CPU
creations-chat 2020-10-11 00:19:37 so yes, but then again my cpu is from an office pc

creations-chat 2020-10-11 00:21:05 also just trial and error, you'll need to adjust your springs

the-dump 2021-01-12 11:22:20 just because "they don't want to be treated as human"
the-dump 2021-01-12 11:22:24 your point makes no sense
the-dump 2021-01-12 11:22:46 you argue that it's okay for them to be shot

the-dump 2021-05-13 21:53:12 start a guayando chain and I'm leaving a 5 hour slowmode for the rest of the CET night
the-dump 2021-05-13 21:53:50 please do so
the-dump 2021-05-13 21:54:19 I'll do it when necessary
the-dump 2021-05-13 21:54:22 but not now
the-dump 2021-05-13 21:59:12 be pcc mod for half a day and let's see how many of your already few braincells will remain
the-dump 2021-05-13 21:59:14 spoiler, -2
the-dump 2021-05-13 21:59:47 I know, but I will still proceed to shut him up
the-dump 2021-05-13 22:00:14 as it does not make him cool, or hip, or a better builder
the-dump 2021-05-13 22:00:16 it's annoying
the-dump 2021-05-13 22:00:22 not quite
the-dump 2021-05-13 22:01:01 I will
the-dump 2021-05-13 22:01:06 because the channel was fucking unusable
the-dump 2021-05-13 22:01:15 and there's no other way to silence a bunch of drugged toddlers
the-dump 2021-05-13 22:01:27 dump is inside pcc
the-dump 2021-05-13 22:02:11 I do not give a shit if people are annoyed
the-dump 2021-05-13 22:02:40 I am forced to become a dictator and silence people because they do not listen
the-dump 2021-05-13 22:03:00 "benefit of the community"
the-dump 2021-05-13 22:03:18 you do not know how much better the community would be if I was a **true** discord moderator
the-dump 2021-05-13 22:03:53 spoiler, I would ban people the first moment I see them while I'm in a bad mood
the-dump 2021-05-13 22:04:14 you would not last 5 seconds if that were the case
the-dump 2021-05-13 22:04:17 just saying
the-dump 2021-05-13 22:04:34 as far as I remember, this is the first time I got truly angry
the-dump 2021-05-13 22:05:24 I will do 5 hour next time with gratis ban spree <:hypertrollface:778903165017260043>
the-dump 2021-05-13 22:06:25 also, you forgot one thing
the-dump 2021-05-13 22:06:26 
the-dump 2021-05-13 22:06:36 I DID do a faster slowmode earlier
the-dump 2021-05-13 22:06:41 too bad you were blind to notice that
the-dump 2021-05-13 22:06:43 <:trollface:775024642104229898>
the-dump 2021-05-13 22:06:54 no it did
the-dump 2021-05-13 22:06:56 but it did nothing
the-dump 2021-05-13 22:07:03 so I resorted to the forced silence
the-dump 2021-05-13 22:07:22 had puri or mega arrived here, it would be an absolute massacre
the-dump 2021-05-13 22:07:56 not obc really
the-dump 2021-05-13 22:07:58 he busy man
the-dump 2021-05-13 22:08:56 no he would've went back in the chain and he would've warned people for each <:trollface:775024642104229898> that you unhinged brainlets did
the-dump 2021-05-13 22:09:30 not too late
the-dump 2021-05-13 22:09:33 <:hypertrollface:778903165017260043>
the-dump 2021-05-13 22:10:14 massive trollface spam, it was unusable and people are mad I had to silence it
the-dump 2021-05-13 22:11:02 <@!751806644740030545> 1 active
creations-chat 2021-05-13 22:13:16 damn can people not get mad about different opinions
the-dump 2021-05-13 22:17:18 also had the symbol on the hat
the-dump 2021-05-13 22:19:50 I warned you all
the-dump 2021-05-13 22:19:55 have fun with the 5 hour slowmode
the-dump 2021-05-13 22:20:08 no time for feeling sorry
the-dump 2021-05-13 22:21:04 ask rbk or another mod to remove in due time
the-dump 2021-05-13 22:21:13 however they'll agree with me (probably)
the-dump 2021-05-13 22:32:41 <@!466793357318815744> next time they do it make sure it's 10 hours and don't take it off for 10 hours
the-dump 2021-05-13 22:32:43 <:trollface:775024642104229898>
the-dump 2021-05-13 22:34:19 next time I see you try to loophole, you will suffer
the-dump 2021-05-13 22:34:48 where does it say you can chain
the-dump 2021-05-13 22:34:50 <:kekw:759451065367658507>
the-dump 2021-05-13 22:35:06 memes
the-dump 2021-05-13 22:35:08 and not spamming?
the-dump 2021-05-13 22:35:44 you're missing my point
the-dump 2021-05-13 22:35:56 all chains were pretty slow and had like one contributor every minute
the-dump 2021-05-13 22:36:04 the troll spam was so hectic my discord almost froze
the-dump 2021-05-13 22:36:07 do you get it now
the-dump 2021-05-13 22:36:10 you numbskull
the-dump 2021-05-13 22:36:27 literally talking to a brick wall, not even going to bother
the-dump 2021-05-13 22:37:42 step 1: be hollow
step 2: sell your soul
step 3: ???
step 4: pro
the-dump 2021-05-13 22:39:15 if that's the only funny thing, then leave
the-dump 2021-05-13 22:39:17 it would be my pleasure
the-dump 2021-05-13 22:39:37 I'm not going to be that much of a garbage human
the-dump 2021-05-13 22:39:47 >notifying a mod about people very clearly breaking rules
>"mod's pet"
the-dump 2021-05-13 22:40:51 yousuf has a reputation
the-dump 2021-05-13 22:40:52 I don't
the-dump 2021-05-13 22:41:00 so I have to resort to more drastic measures
the-dump 2021-05-13 22:41:11 good
the-dump 2021-05-13 22:41:20 I can't force people to like me
the-dump 2021-05-13 22:41:27 so I might as well make them hate me
the-dump 2021-05-13 22:41:29 <:kekw:759451065367658507>
the-dump 2021-05-13 22:42:14 ok but next time you ping me with nothing valuable to say, it's definitely going to be a funny warn
the-dump 2021-05-13 22:42:54 depends <:trollbosnia:723223297134821458>

creations-chat 2022-04-07 14:25:21 replace the turret completely, add the missing roadwheel, add the suspension pieces, make it longer, and make the hull above the tracks less tall by like 0.5 blocks

zach the m4a2 shermans are all flat af on the front
creations-chat 2022-04-07 14:28:03 missing the travel lock

because the wheels are too large, use sparklers
