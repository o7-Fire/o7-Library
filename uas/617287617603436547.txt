plane-crazy 2020-07-31 07:20:28 long range ballistic missile
plane-crazy 2020-07-31 07:20:20 i made a long range missile lol
plane-crazy 2020-07-31 07:18:53 sometimes i hate locked motors when i want them to work as normal motors
plane-crazy 2020-07-31 07:18:30 give me horizontal tail designs
plane-crazy 2020-07-31 07:18:02 comically small horizontal tail
plane-crazy 2020-07-31 07:17:48 should i make it bigger huh
plane-crazy 2020-07-31 07:17:23 when its going faster it would spin around and lose its mind
plane-crazy 2020-07-31 07:17:07 what more should i add to this
plane-crazy 2020-07-31 07:16:45 i mean i made it so that it is maximum speed
plane-crazy 2020-07-31 07:16:13 its fast even at minimum speed
plane-crazy 2020-07-31 07:15:51 so i'll add parachutes at my plane to slow it down right?
plane-crazy 2020-07-31 07:14:52 should i add parachutes at the end to slow it down
plane-crazy 2020-07-31 07:14:36 help how the hell do i land my plane it keeps on bouncing
plane-crazy 2020-07-31 07:13:48 the combustion chamber would be just big and unstable
plane-crazy 2020-07-31 07:13:23 > combustion instability in sea dragon engine
<@!274565008837574656>  this
plane-crazy 2020-07-31 07:12:06 ight
plane-crazy 2020-07-31 07:11:51 iirc, the f1 rocket engines had baffles to stablise rocket engine and not explode even if a bomb went off inside the combustion chamber because they did that apparently
plane-crazy 2020-07-31 07:09:21 thats why the F1 rocket engines combustion chamber had baffles to stablise engine
plane-crazy 2020-07-31 07:08:47 anyway the sea dragon would be destroyed by instability
plane-crazy 2020-07-31 07:08:23 My main is PepsiGod0602
plane-crazy 2020-07-31 07:08:04 Not based off of any plane
plane-crazy 2020-07-31 07:02:34 because hyperinflation
plane-crazy 2020-07-31 07:02:21 everybody in zimbabwe once became a trillinaire lol
plane-crazy 2020-07-31 07:01:59 add for inflation
plane-crazy 2020-07-31 07:01:45 yeah
plane-crazy 2020-07-31 07:01:26 i need quadruple digit speeds
plane-crazy 2020-07-31 07:01:10 how the hell do you make a conveyor drive
plane-crazy 2020-07-31 07:00:55 ight ima add more rockets to my plane for maximum speed
plane-crazy 2020-07-31 07:00:34 near unlimited budget
plane-crazy 2020-07-31 06:59:50 if they had unlimited money like nasa in the apollo program then idk
plane-crazy 2020-07-31 06:59:27 yeah
plane-crazy 2020-07-31 06:58:51 european space agency should land a lander on saturns moon europa for shits and giggles and some possible science
plane-crazy 2020-07-31 06:56:53 make any rocket made by ULA <@456226577798135808>
plane-crazy 2020-07-31 06:56:03 i watched the launch of perseverance mars rover today
plane-crazy 2020-07-31 06:55:32 buran energia is soviet space shuttle
plane-crazy 2020-07-31 06:55:11 then energia rocket
plane-crazy 2020-07-31 06:54:54 nah
plane-crazy 2020-07-31 06:54:43 or idk, falcon 9
plane-crazy 2020-07-31 06:54:35 <@456226577798135808> saturn v
plane-crazy 2020-07-31 06:54:17 it's kinda fun for me building things on mobile
plane-crazy 2020-07-31 06:53:00 moar engines
plane-crazy 2020-07-31 06:52:48 it won't fly lol
plane-crazy 2020-07-31 06:52:39 well i tried making a fighter plane in mobile and it failed horribly
plane-crazy 2020-07-31 06:52:20 xue hua piao piao
plane-crazy 2020-07-31 06:51:58 like in real life
plane-crazy 2020-07-31 06:51:53 and n1 must go boom
plane-crazy 2020-07-31 06:51:46 not big enough
plane-crazy 2020-07-31 06:51:29 miner make H U G E N1 rocket
plane-crazy 2020-07-31 06:50:52 people making N1 rocket is kerbal space program players
plane-crazy 2020-07-31 06:50:27 N1 is too much rocket engines
plane-crazy 2020-07-31 06:50:00 <@!697786877444358186> try doing the N1, you'll love it with the number of rockets
