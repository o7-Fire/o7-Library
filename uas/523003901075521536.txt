creations-chat 2020-09-28 04:15:54 My build is left to other's opinions and so what the result is generally reflects the percentage that liked it

creations-chat 2021-02-07 01:57:41 For the question from before, it wasn't my favourite because of a little bit of inaccuracy. But ive just gotten rid of it since yeah, that didn't have any reason to warrant a downvote.
creations-chat 2021-02-07 02:00:05 Are you going to go on a sob rampage? This is an online forum. You're gonna have people that simply don't like whoever's builds have been plastered on the <#384025409945337856> and that goes for me as well.

creations-chat 2021-03-24 08:50:10 bruh why would you start an argument over some downvotes

1. it's not worth it
2. It's blocking your progress
3. it wastes people's time
creations-chat 2021-03-24 08:54:38 Congratulations (you corrected me, thanks, no cap) and also bruh it's not worth it to start arguing over a trivial mistake. All it does it waste your own time and drains your mind.

creations-chat 2021-06-07 10:07:35 The U2 looks a bit too short. Wings are overdone (simplify a bit, make smoother). Darken the colour, it's a bit light. Those post things on the wings (bombs?) are too small, ***embiggen*** them
creations-chat 2021-06-07 10:20:05 hey dude, if you want to be able to see more angles for a plane you're planning to build I recommend using a blueprint (eg U2 spy plane blueprint) or 3d model (sketchfab is good.)

creations-chat 2021-06-15 06:56:13 A close-in weapon system (CIWS /ˈsiːwɪz/ SEE-wiz)[1] is a point-defense weapon system for detecting and destroying short-range incoming missiles and enemy aircraft which have penetrated the outer defenses, typically mounted shipboard in a naval capacity. Nearly all classes of larger modern warships are equipped with some kind of CIWS device.

There are two types of CIWS systems. A gun-based CIWS usually consists of a combination of radars, computers, and rapid-firing multiple-barrel rotary cannons placed on a rotating turret. Missile-based CIWSs use either infra-red, passive radar/ESM, or semi-active radar terminal guidance to guide missiles to the targeted enemy aircraft or other threats. In some cases, CIWS are used on land to protect military bases. In this case, the CIWS can also protect the base from shell and rocket fire.

Ego hurt
Try insult feedback giver
creations-chat 2021-08-20 05:34:38 personally if it happens to me i don't take the insult to heart and instead focus on the things they pointed out

creations-chat 2021-09-02 01:03:44 
creations-chat 2021-09-02 01:06:15 personally, not really, i don't think im seeing your side of the thingo

it might possibly be like that because the thing that juts out of the fuselage that holds the landing gear is too small
creations-chat 2021-09-02 01:09:45 the sides of the fuselage line up with the blueprint lines (besides the landing gear part)

i think that's whats missing

edit: i see now, i thought you said the actual body was thin, but thanks for your insight

creations-chat 2021-09-10 00:42:43 oh what's up with it?
creations-chat 2021-09-10 00:46:29 hmm i see, i think it was the distance at where the picture was taken since there are sharp corners present on the aircraft

creations-chat 2022-01-22 02:23:52 I can't help but compare custom builds to the real thing and mentally point out all the things that don't match, even if it's not intended
creations-chat 2022-01-22 02:27:28 Imo that thought isn't far fetched, I see many examples of trash "custom" (insert jet here) in creations
creations-chat 2022-01-22 02:29:59 That's a good idea, but I think the whole custom drama is conjured in the minds of most people here and original is probably set to cause even more confusion

creations-chat 2022-01-23 00:43:42 Off topic, but a quick guide to your/you're

You're is short for **you are**. It doesn't make sense in "I love you're build" because it means "I love you are build." It would make sense in " You're such a good builder!"

Your is used for when you are referring to another person's thing. "Your build is great!" "Can I have a look at your plane?"

creations-chat 2022-01-31 20:40:05 U really said "can I do better?" Anyway places to improve are the colours and fix the lumpiness. It can easily be done with wedges and motor locking. The colours look basic and comical.

creations-chat 2022-02-15 23:17:25 Hmmm idk, it looks fine at that angle but the first angle made it look small

I have another suggestion, make the vert stabs look more connected to the fuselage, it could probably be ripped out of the fuselage during some high force manoeuvre

creations-chat 2022-03-06 07:03:41 It's not bad, i suggest extending the body back a by block or so so it looks natural and balanced 👍
creations-chat 2022-03-06 07:05:46 Rip
creations-chat 2022-03-06 08:09:02 If you have a lock tower attach the motors that rotate the vert stabilisers to that so it hides inside the fuselage AND move the vert stabs out maybe a block or so so it looks more natural

creations-chat 2022-03-10 09:38:45 <@!744567798025420831> 

if motor angle locks don't work, use camera locks

Here's my feedback:
1. Nose too long
2. Wing looks like it was angle locked in the wrong place
3. plane looks weirdly long, might just be my perception

i suggest comparing blueprints (resized *to scale*) on three angles of your plane to help you make it better
creations-chat 2022-03-10 09:42:14 angle lock mechanism should be in the spine, not halfway out the wings

You're is short for you are. It doesn't make sense in "I love you're build" because it means "I love you are build."

Your is used for when you are referring to another person's thing. "Your build is great!" "Can I have a look at your plane?"

creations-chat 2022-04-28 09:56:49 tbh shaders are annoying they add artificial appeal to a build
creations-chat 2022-04-28 09:59:02 in all honesty even if there are small details I cannot see in an unaltered image i think shaders are artificial leverage over others that don't have access to them

it is more charming in my opinion to see builds like yours that already look epic with just normal lighting

i'm trying to be respectful and not start anything
creations-chat 2022-04-28 10:02:13 honestly i never really looked there in the first place, the position of the area makes it hard for eyes to naturally track to that location unless pointed to like with your picture above this msg

creations-chat 2022-05-26 22:02:12 It also has anime eyes somehow
creations-chat 2022-05-26 22:04:14 How did he do the cockpit lines they look impossible to replicate
creations-chat 2022-05-26 22:06:15 But trails are a block long and they wouldn't be smooth like that

<@456226577798135808>  whats the "super happy face"?
creations-chat 2022-05-26 22:08:30 I think this plane is fakery rn, a bunch of impossible stuff

And what I've gathered from his little explanation is that magnet locking only gets rid of the motors, it doesn't impact the shape of the plane when motor locking either way

<@551376778552410113>  yes
creations-chat 2022-05-26 22:11:05 Look inside that cockpit and you see a pale anime face with no goggles
creations-chat 2022-05-26 22:13:06 I think that nose and cockpit is cap we need a bm ss
creations-chat 2022-05-26 22:15:59 <@770764150048948224>  explain why your plane looks unreal now°°°`<<°□<!!!
creations-chat 2022-05-26 22:21:00 True
creations-chat 2022-05-26 22:43:00 Man had a real plane after all
creations-chat 2022-05-26 22:45:03 <@770764150048948224>  How did you make the cockpit frames? Trails or lights or smoke pipes or wot
creations-chat 2022-05-26 22:47:04 Heresom conveniently avoided my cockpit lines question
creations-chat 2022-05-26 22:50:27 Nowhere did heresom explain the cockpit frames though. No block can look like that

Smoke pipes can't be glass
creations-chat 2022-05-26 22:52:40 Alright then ty
creations-chat 2022-05-26 22:54:41 I'm confused again, trails are a block long and it would surely show imperfections when locked into place
creations-chat 2022-05-26 22:57:59 This is probably why he doesn't want to show the spawning in bit
creations-chat 2022-05-26 23:00:01 Been keeping heresom up for a whole day now lmao
creations-chat 2022-05-26 23:02:01 That build mode IS FOR THE OLD PLANE LMAOOOO
creations-chat 2022-05-26 23:04:24 That build mode is for a slightly modified old plane that looks nothing like the new one, cockpit cylinder in bm is smooth but the one spawned has edges, nose is simply impossible
creations-chat 2022-05-26 23:06:25 Fake build, downvote it to hell
creations-chat 2022-05-26 23:08:27 This is definitely a fake with a modified old build to make it look real

There is no explanation for the smooth cockpit lines and the canopy edges, and the nose is not possible with that bm ss

I suggest Jordan to do blueprint overlays for maximum realism
creations-chat 2022-06-01 05:26:56 Can find vulpen tutorial i think

But gist of it is find a paint program that u can add layers to, put a blueprint on the first layer then go to the layer on top set it to 50% opacity then put the picture of your plane and compare it and make sure to resize the pictures to scale otherwise it might be too long or too squashed etc

What you must do is be bearable

creations-chat 2022-07-11 10:43:40 ok, could've said that first and made yourself not look like an asshat

1. Fix the canopy, the join looks too low and is dumb
2. Don't name it "f16i" it is clearly not an f16
3. It looks super stubby because of lack of low angles in such a tiny build

Better off rebuilding it at a slightly larger scale, incorporating proper angle and motor lock, studying the elegant shape of fighter jets and renaming it to something that is not real
creations-chat 2022-07-11 11:15:33 People when they

"(Name of irl jet)" "custom"

creations-chat 2022-07-16 10:28:14 lmao
creations-chat 2022-07-16 10:31:19 how many upvotes could this get

i think the standards look lower because of the flood of newbies and the physical increase in the number of ppl that look in <#384025409945337856> 

the number of people that have been here for a while and have high standards are being diluted by all the low-standard kids

<@720891502108344360>  HECKDUCK

<@723940197456281640> that's true, but imo it still inflates the upvote count just because the lighting is more impressive
creations-chat 2022-07-16 10:44:17 i def remember mods saying it was banned (this was a while ago) 

not dissing scout, this tank is really good and im not saying its bad in any way, but this is almost definitely going to get more upvotes because of the shaders
creations-chat 2022-07-16 10:46:49 they're very subtle

you can click on the link for the tank in the plane crazy lighting

<@849139320106516491>  yeah
and to people that glance at a creation before making their decision, usually the positive impression the lighting makes is enough to make them upvote when they would usually ignore it or dv

help 2022-07-17 09:00:54 doesn't look like it
creations-chat 2022-07-17 10:03:01 the reason it's not appreciated is because 1. it's lazy and not impressive and 2. it's bad

the only thing appreciated here is the things that almost nobody can do
creations-chat 2022-07-17 10:07:36 I don't even know what "corvus" is but everything in your creations thing is shit, you know it, and you don't even try to make it better

nobody will appreciate the shit

we will only appreciate good builds that have effort put into them
creations-chat 2022-07-17 10:10:18 that's less shit than the stuff you posted just now, hence you got a mid amount of upvotes

is there any improvement along the line though? your jet is shit, your car is shit. you even try to sweet talk us by "it's not bad to be basic right?"

if you want to get better and if you want to get respect, stop posting shit and start trying to build actual non-shit
creations-chat 2022-07-17 10:12:45 i mean bruh complaining that "basic" isn't recognised in a server full of talented creators is just shortsighted
creations-chat 2022-07-17 10:14:59 that's because every role that isn't V or X requires zero skill

help 2022-07-18 05:15:23 1. Camera locking is a way of angle locking that doesn't require motors

It's good for parts of a build that would otherwise be overcomplicated by angled components

Camera lock welds to the pilot seat, so you can't connect it with a motorlock tower

2. Piston lock is a way of fine tuning the position of a block or component so it can fill a space effectively

This is good for highly technically complex builds that have many different shapes 

It can be glitchy

Usually these two are used in tandem with motorlocking (especially piston  lock) to enhance the effect motorlocking components onto a build has
creations-chat 2022-07-19 10:11:12 maybe raise the score requirement because theres so many more voters nowadays
creations-chat 2022-07-19 10:13:32 expert designer is supposed to be for the best of the best that arent HOF...

in my honest opinion I think it should be 200 score

it has been reached before by good builders
creations-chat 2022-07-19 10:15:41 most average builds now which would have evened out at probably 30-30 in 2020 are now getting 120-10 

*expert* designer isnt supposed to be for everyone
creations-chat 2022-07-19 10:24:02 the only reason people shit on expert designer now is because the physical amount of voters has increased in this channel, most of which don't have much skill and so automatically upvote anything that looks mid-above (or is a meme build)

it has gotten easier to get a high quantity of upvotes, but the requirements for the ranks havent changed
creations-chat 2022-07-19 10:26:15 maybe there should be a filter for meme builds, because they dont demonstrate skill
creations-chat 2022-07-19 10:31:33 If a meme build is obviously low effort, like a fucken carrot or a chair, it should be denied

the fact your build is a meme has definitely helped it along, but theres no denying that it's not a low effort build
creations-chat 2022-07-19 10:33:53 shaders are a different story

my opinion is  that for creations posts they shouldnt be allowed
builds have achieved high upvote quotas without shaders
they artificially enhance the build without adding anything to it

the same thing applies to actual edits of the image

creations-chat 2022-07-23 04:33:43 it tends to happen after the few people that build well and patrol the chat a lot have voted, then the whitenames slowly come in and add their opinion (upvotes)
creations-chat 2022-07-23 04:37:18 people need to get used to the fact their effort is not always appreciated and builds can be bad
creations-chat 2022-07-23 04:40:37 I sense another argument starting up

m8 u gonna want to shut your mouth before something happens

the island was bad, having a furry in there only polarised our opinions

creations-chat 2022-07-23 05:02:49 are you saying the ship is bad too?
creations-chat 2022-07-23 05:04:50 Your plane is so fucking bad

What is that nose

What kind of person are you to throw a random person's build under the bus to try and prove something that is wrong

Your build is undeniably worse than that guy's boat

The only thing wrong with his boat is the shape of the hull

The only thing wrong with your plane is EVERYTHING

take responsibility for your own stuff
creations-chat 2022-07-23 05:10:00 You should take your madness elsewhere, there are already enough complainers here

Jets are both built often and have really high standards for quality. Your jet was shit on because it is both trash + does not hold a candle to the best builds here. Ships are none of those things. You should know that the amount of upvotes was deserved and you were lucky not to get hate for it.
creations-chat 2022-07-23 05:47:51 Four down, 553 to go

creations-chat 2022-07-24 07:54:41 rip

I have an idea

Attach ropes to the suspensions

It'll make the springiness less temperamental

Leave the rope settings on default

I know, the ropes will stretch with it

creations-chat 2022-07-24 11:37:09 not bad, gg

one of my personal gripes is the windows, they look large, but there's not much you could do

would earn my upvote
creations-chat 2022-07-24 11:39:35 it depends on your priorities

If you are going to post the 747 in creations, you are probably better off using the smaller text blocks for the windows in the post but just use the regular glass windows in public servers

that's what I would do
creations-chat 2022-07-24 11:41:37 imo Qantas would be a super cool one

creations-chat 2022-07-25 03:55:14 I would ban the noobs who make zero effort to ask for help and get defensive when we tell them something is wrong with their build

Not being able to take feedback will stagnate the building meta here

creations-chat 2022-07-28 03:34:12 big boi weigh 100kg fr

<@927145074867978240>  could be worse, what plane is it
creations-chat 2022-07-28 03:38:05 he really is double-wide <:pain:644301805534183464> 

<@927145074867978240>  if you rebuild it consider the angles of the plane and use angle lock. The nose is fine but the wings and the rear of the fuselage on the actual plane taper back. On your plane it's just straight and then boom angle down

Not using angle lock won't help you make a better plane
creations-chat 2022-07-28 03:40:06 bc ppl here hate u
creations-chat 2022-07-28 03:43:30 ppl here for a while know that soup has a reputation for dramatising stuff and causing arguments
creations-chat 2022-07-28 03:46:52 soup what part of you thinks this server is the right place to push these agendas
creations-chat 2022-07-28 03:52:28 Only thing it really needs is texture and colour variation

You can achieve that by using different materials (for example metal for the tractor and sand for some stuff in nooks and crannies and whatever)

creations-chat 2022-07-30 06:55:23 There is no reason to out of the blue point out something about somebody that has no relation to you as gossip

It's important to realise there is a time and a  place for these discussions, particularly because they are of sensitive nature

This is the reason why you are disliked here
creations-chat 2022-07-30 06:58:07 Do you *want* to be hated? Is it the reason why you are here?

creations-chat 2022-07-30 07:10:35 I remember that, I said furries because of the discussion precipitating following someone including a furry in their build

Do you believe it is your obligation to talk about LGTV 4KHD and etc in this server?
creations-chat 2022-07-30 07:17:26 Oh yeah, I see what you mean

Typically, the kind of audience this server attracts is in the 13 - 17 y/o range of people where most openly diss LGTV because of its differences

It is important to, as a person, suppress your anger and accept there is nothing you can do in certain situations (such as these)

Going out and attempting to cause drama (whether intentional or unintentional), however, is a drain on both your mental health and the health of the people in this server

Try to look at what's happening from another perspective and attempt to understand their point of view

Agreement can only be made through understanding

You're is short for you are. It doesn't make sense in "I love you're build" because it means "I love you are build."

Your is used for when you are referring to another person's thing. "Your build is great!" "Can I have a look at your plane?"

creations-chat 2022-08-08 11:32:53 when will soup learn that this server is not the place to discuss politics
creations-chat 2022-08-08 11:37:14 Suddenly I feel the urge to physically harm you, but I won't + can't bc this is online

The general age level of this server is 13-17, and so some may find they cannot bring their ideas across in an intelligent manner. Usually that causes arguments because the person speaking about their beliefs becomes annoyed by the seeming lack of discursion in that topic.

Soup is not an unde; they just feel a need to speak about their beliefs in a place which may not always be receptive to them.

instead it is a large empty deck for storing whatever
creations-chat 2022-08-29 05:37:31 Might modify it slightly just so users can land their helis on it and stuff, idk

<@984694509772357662>  ikr its so stupid, I remember reading about it and seeing tons of complaints about its inadequacy as a patrol ship

Its armaments are too sparse and too small and there is no helipad
creations-chat 2022-08-29 05:43:22 yeah

They actually revised it and made one new ship called HMS Clyde, which has more higher calibre guns and a real helipad
creations-chat 2022-08-29 05:46:44 Thanks boi

yes I have been considering adding a helipad for a while, I might rebrand it as HMS Clyde, do the according modifications and then EPICNESS

Cool heli
creations-chat 2022-08-29 05:49:44 Rip

You could possibly piston lock the  landing skates down by less than half a block to make it go lower

creations-chat 2022-08-30 11:35:54 <@456226577798135808>  people are gonna downvote your plane for looking goofy even though it's accurate to the irl plane 💀

Not an insult; the irl f16 sufa looks funny and not much like the normal f16 so people will ignore sufa and judge the looks in comparison to a normal f16 and not the sufa variant

<@653059099533115423>  i'll try that, ty for the suggestion
creations-chat 2022-09-02 14:24:26 YES I have one, someone told me abt it a while ago

So basically when u finish bending an angle lock to the right place, instead of letting go of the key press and hold the other motor movement key so that both movement keys are pressed at the same time for like 5 seconds so the movement stops

then after that u can let go and it shouldn't lag back
creations-chat 2022-09-02 14:46:53 oh no

wdym corrupts build apart?

hmm I think that specifically could be a lag problem, sometimes it does it to me but it just teleports back into place like it should

does it make the fold unusable like does it just stay oj the ground or something
creations-chat 2022-09-02 14:50:39 hmm I think that specifically could be a lag problem, sometimes it does it to me but it just teleports back into place like it should

does it make the fold unusable like does it just stay oj the ground or something
creations-chat 2022-09-02 14:53:28 if u could send me a clip of that happening, that would be optimal

Rn the only thing I can suggest is repeat it or hold it for longer bc I'm not entirely sure

I've managed to make it work on two of my builds that previously had really bad motor lag problems

Rip

<@657846484397719553>  are you holding it for long enough? u gotta hold both keys down for at least like 5 seconds for it to work
creations-chat 2022-09-02 15:09:59 u don't let go of any key when u want to stop the motor movement, you instead press and hold down both the key u used to move it and the key that counteracts the movement 

For example

Forwards = F, Backwards = R

Hold down F to move to desired location

WITHOUT LETTING GO OF F press and hold down R and hold both keys for 5 seconds

Timing is important

creations-chat 2022-09-06 09:42:29 Inaccuracies abound
creations-chat 2022-09-06 09:45:18 Almost the same + same things wrong

Non motorlocked front area
Half half wedge that really does not belong
You didn't place the tracks

You basically skimped over placing some pretty big details in the front

+ detailless (where's the signs and ladders and whatever?)
creations-chat 2022-09-06 09:47:23 Sounds like you're getting mad over my pretty tame feedback 👻
creations-chat 2022-09-06 09:49:38 Better but those things I said before still stand out too much

If you're going to make the tracks consider using signs instead of full blocks bc signs are thinner

Plus actually consider the shape of the front and combine it with your build

Simply ignoring it won't make it go away
creations-chat 2022-09-06 09:55:11 I wasn't talking about that half block, I'm talking about the front bit where there's two half wedge down 1x2s and half wedges next to them

It's a significant part of the tank and you're better off angle locking those details in for better visual effect

bug-reports 2022-09-29 14:23:06 Bug with hover drives where you just glitch in the sky when flying (looks like a freeze/build vanishes for a few frames), the hover drive instantly stops working and you fall out of the sky

Happened to one propeller on one of my aircraft which was quite fun. It also happened to my pvp plane at least three times recently

creations-chat 2022-10-03 04:10:25 ppl forget that technology progresses and the f35 is a multirole plane capable of ground attack, bombing and fighting
creations-chat 2022-10-03 04:12:34 ikr, imagine a6 intruder, f22 and b2 spirit when you can have f35

all that functionality in one standard package
creations-chat 2022-10-03 04:15:21 that's right but which of those aircraft is the most well-rounded and hence worth purchasing and using

one aircraft for the power of three

future air power
creations-chat 2022-10-03 04:18:14 what about the cost of maintenance and separate technologies to manage

how much more would that cost relative to an f35 and hence how much more power would countries with the f35 have
creations-chat 2022-10-03 04:21:07 not necessarily for the us but other countries that purchase it in collaboration with the US

the us economy is massive but these smaller countries economies are not and so wish to have a well-rounded, technologically advanced, relatively simple-to-maintain jet

the f35 was built for export markets as well, unlike the f22

<@700761272282775593>  f18 stealth is bad + it is very old
creations-chat 2022-10-03 04:23:11 that's where the us government fucked up, it was supposed to be one variant but they changed it because of issues

hence all the media complaints trickled from it
creations-chat 2022-10-03 04:25:46 which jacks up the maintenance cost and puts all governments that field the planes in strife

the f35 program sadly diverged because of the aforementioned problems that were the fault of boeing and the govt
creations-chat 2022-10-03 04:27:51 yes, that is true

it's good for foreign markets though because only a handful of countries field carriers and so really only one variant is necessary which still doesn't compromise on its ability to do its job well

To the us, it was a failure in its aim but not in its function
creations-chat 2022-10-03 04:29:56 14 countries have the f35

seen one in RAAF base near me
creations-chat 2022-10-03 04:32:01 not as much as a6 intruder + f22 + b2 spirit combined!!!!!!!!!

1 plane with functionality of 3!!!!!!

usa fucked up with carrier ability tho!!!!
creations-chat 2022-10-03 04:34:04 f14 undoubtedly looks cooler let's be real here

but f35 could smoke f14 in an engagement any day
creations-chat 2022-10-03 04:37:15 F35 hurts government coffers tho not as much as a6 intruder + f22 + b2 spirit combined!!!!!!!!!

1 plane with functionality of 3!!!!!!

usa fucked up with carrier ability tho!!!!

u guys see in desert storm they used tons of different planes in different roles that the f35 could fill (besides probably the b52)

creations-chat 2022-10-08 08:05:44 hello Mortified_AWACS

Full tutorial

Go to www.photopea.com (you can use others but this one is the most convenient)

1. Press "New Project"

2. Set resolution to desired one (not required) and then press "Create"

3. Open an image of your blueprint (use "edit" --> "transform" --> "scale" and resize it

4. Create a new layer and place it on top of the layer you have your blueprint on (Go to "Layer" --> "New" --> "Layer)

Your new layer should be visible on the right hand side of the screen in the layers panel

5. Select your new layer (name is default "Layer 1", change opacity to 50% (this setting is visible directly above your layers)

6. Insert an image of your plane on the new layer and go "edit" --> "transform" --> "scale" to resize it and "edit" --> "transform" --> "rotate" to rotate it

7. Enjoy

Note: do not under any circumstance use "free transform"  because you might mess up the scale of your build

bug-reports 2022-10-09 14:32:41 I've observed the server lag when using builds and spawning them

Ping when builds are despawned is normal

Ping when builds are loading in spikes to about 600

When setting pistons, ping increases by about 300 per second until it reaches a cap and returns to about 500

Angle locking lag is the same except the cap is much higher (in a vip server around 3k, in a public server with at least three big builds it went up to 17k before the server died)

Public servers are incredibly laggy and the characters desync for up to 10 seconds at a time

The lag originated about two days ago and appears to have worsened over time
bug-reports 2022-10-09 14:34:35 Possibly

The ping is really bad when the data transfer is going on, which might be related
bug-reports 2022-10-09 14:34:42 yeah
bug-reports 2022-10-09 14:35:40 Alr
bug-reports 2022-10-09 14:38:03 You get zero ping lag at all in public servers?
bug-reports 2022-10-09 14:38:18 All public servers I've joined are in the dumps
bug-reports 2022-10-09 14:38:23 lol
bug-reports 2022-10-09 14:38:58 Bc the lag was playing havoc with my build i left perf stats on for the last couple days and it's terrible
bug-reports 2022-10-09 14:39:05 Yeah it's horrible
bug-reports 2022-10-09 14:39:10 Public servers are unplayable
bug-reports 2022-10-09 14:39:38 Really strange
bug-reports 2022-10-09 14:39:52 I haven't been getting your fps issues but the latency ping lag is terrible

bug-reports 2022-10-09 14:42:31 yeah
bug-reports 2022-10-09 14:42:42 physics lag becomes horrendous mostly when I use pistons
bug-reports 2022-10-09 14:42:57 They glitch back and sometimes kick me from the server with the client behaviour error message
bug-reports 2022-10-09 14:43:59 I've seen that too

I think the only reason  why I get the kicked message is because I use so many pistons and it breaks stuff
bug-reports 2022-10-09 14:44:07 48 pistons in my plane rn
bug-reports 2022-10-09 14:44:27 Rip

creations-chat 2022-10-11 09:31:59 <@901190057648603177>  the detail where the little turrets are is pretty decent

Id say (besides making tracks for that giant thing) you need to add more detail in the form of slight colour and material variations

Use material sparingly in conjunction with small details i.e. texturing a ladder or the wheels or something along those lines

Don't use it on a large flat surface and don't spam it everywhere otherwise it'll look messy

creations-chat 2022-10-24 21:59:46 <@652925710976942100>  that f14 looks wrong

why is there a random one block drop in the back (yes its wedges but that's not the point)

whats happened looks like the whole wing assembly was not angled down, so the fuselage wasn't angled down, which caused the gap

horizontal body proportions are slightly cooked

shame
creations-chat 2022-10-24 23:49:57 how about n o

bad
creations-chat 2022-10-29 23:39:05 your choice mr noob
creations-chat 2022-10-29 23:41:34 people like you is the reason people like mr noob stay noob and don't get better

you stop them from seeing the negatives of their build and hence what they can do to make it better

you are facilitating stagnation of skill
creations-chat 2022-10-29 23:44:28 There is a difference between being polite and calling bad builds "good"

Countless people here have been encouraged to build better with every iteration, myself included

nobody's going to coddle anybody in the real world

Take criticism, cut out the unhelpful parts and make something useful out of it
creations-chat 2022-10-29 23:48:53 Encouraging someone to change nothing about what they did?

The problem is with most people now is that everybody is full of praise and is scared to offer criticism. Criticism is a reality and nobody can avoid it.

I gave him points to improve in his plane, whereas you did not

On top of that, people need to learn to handle criticism

Everyone here is a teenager who should be mentally flexible enough to do so
creations-chat 2022-10-29 23:51:04 If they are too young, they shouldn't be here anyway

it's not for people to get angry over 💀

creations-chat 2022-12-29 06:30:40 id say the biggest reason is that its one wide

apply that skill onto a proper two wide and youll get a good ratio

also this side profile is cancerous 

try experimenting with blueprint overlays
creations-chat 2022-12-29 06:34:18 it's mostly proportion issues with the side profile as well as the "neck" of the aircraft being about one block too short as well. If you want a full tutorial for how to do blueprint overlays you can dm me

there's a one wide f18 that looks good bc of decals and good scaling
creations-chat 2023-01-02 07:33:03 yes

and 2 wide builds tend to be more complex and more visually appealing

logic scales with ships that have high levels of detail
creations-chat 2023-01-02 10:27:44 Yes it looks a bit less plain now

Now fix the cockpit, currently it arches forward a bit too much, lessen the arch and bring the peak a bit further back

And while you're at it turn it into glass and make cockpit frames

creations-chat 2023-04-30 08:55:39 sounds like a skill issue <:clueless:942802644043464734>
creations-chat 2023-05-03 22:52:48 1. Don't post it in creations (it is invariably shit)

2. send build here and actually take feedback but don't start arguments with ppl

3. If u argue u lose automatically

help 2023-07-09 14:22:06 make a v2 and actually spend a good about of time on it and try to improve

im talking over a week on and off

if u wanna get good at building u don't just blindly do the same thing over and over, u make an effort to change things

for example you could do a motor angled bow and details, those help a ton but take a while to get right

also do small things with decals, low level details help a ton with immersion as well

creations-chat 2023-07-14 12:56:32 well it depends on scale but you generally start with length and make it appropriately tall as you go
