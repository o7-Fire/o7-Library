help 2021-06-15 06:11:16 yeah
help 2021-06-15 06:11:18 But how
creations-chat 2021-06-27 17:09:03 My god, you guys dislike on good builds
creations-chat 2021-06-27 18:17:05 this is a decent build. 49 dislikes.
creations-chat 2021-06-27 18:19:52 just because the person who build this doesn't have special roles doesn't mean its bad, most people with decent builds but have no roles get the most dislikes, sad but true.
creations-chat 2021-06-27 18:22:02 Not as much as you think, it's a social thing and it's true, maybe sometimes. but most of the time the builds are good, it's like a social experiment type things. People would help rich people if the fell, but not poor.
creations-chat 2021-06-27 18:24:16 Not mine, this is a example I got from creations. It looks realistic it just needs a camo. and that's not a reason to dislike it's not the best but it is still good, if it was bad, dislike it
creations-chat 2021-06-27 18:28:01 bad and decency are too different things. Rien, that is not following your opinion, it's others. you should not do that. That's one main reason why people do that too: because if people think it's bad it's probably bad but you should stay to your opinion. that was one guy out of hundreds.
creations-chat 2021-06-27 18:30:23 Not as often as white names though. It's a discrimination thing. Yes it does.
creations-chat 2021-06-27 18:35:23 That's not entirely true. Sum can be a bit on the not bright side because they are new to the game, but that is not all of them.
