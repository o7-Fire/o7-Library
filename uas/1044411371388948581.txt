creations-chat 2023-03-11 01:19:48 How it looks, I keep making corrections 
(I appreciate your opinions and suggestions)
creations-chat 2023-03-12 06:56:05 Hi... I was experimenting looking to remove the motor lock below. I had already thought about this before that moving the motor further away changes the angle and it did and it doesn't stay the same anymore it wasn't what I was looking for but I guess it looks better
creations-chat 2023-03-14 01:33:11 Does it look good compared to the real model?
creations-chat 2023-03-14 01:35:16 Maybe if I reduce where it goes down?
creations-chat 2023-03-14 01:37:20 I see the height quite well and the nose too, the only thing I need to fix is ​​that
creations-chat 2023-03-14 02:14:59 Yes I will try. Any other suggestions?
creations-chat 2023-03-17 00:42:11 how it looks I have remodeled the canopy
creations-chat 2023-03-17 02:09:37 What is the point of this? I had an f 5 that I added doors to the front to make the gun bay it was literally square
creations-chat 2023-03-17 02:14:51 The lines must be very thin... I'll try
creations-chat 2023-03-17 02:25:26 yes... I have never worked with trails, rather I have not experienced it, to avoid doing this a month ago I tried to make a helicopter and the result was not bad but it is difficult for me to adjust all the trails to the angle of the circle, ( 
and if you use half cylinder blocks )
creations-chat 2023-03-17 02:31:55 what do you say about that?
creations-chat 2023-03-17 02:35:05 which parts look smooth
creations-chat 2023-03-17 02:46:35 that was his destiny from the beginning it was just to experiment
creations-chat 2023-04-08 23:52:18 Propellers?
creations-chat 2023-04-09 20:18:29 I have stretched the canopy more, ¿How does it look?
creations-chat 2023-04-09 20:22:44 It has a fuel tank below, don't expect much, also with the load it won't look as high anymore I guess 
If possible, I'll lower it a bit, it's the least of it
creations-chat 2023-04-09 21:03:27 Do you think that being able to use that one, I would have chosen a more complex one? It is the same but it affects him cosmetically I suppose it is the same height 
Also, I can't create a compartment because even creating it, the wheel looks like this is better in all respects, it doesn't matter
creations-chat 2023-04-09 21:05:32 And it looks small from other angles, 
Can't be smaller...
creations-chat 2023-04-09 21:09:19 I was about to delete this but decided to try again making it longer and it was very easy but it looks weird from some angles. When I was using the scale model, it looked very similar now, not quite, but it's longer. and it looks better the angle of the camera also influences The second image shows the size well
creations-chat 2023-04-09 21:25:28 F-5E TIGER II
creations-chat 2023-04-09 21:30:34 If we compare it with the real model it looks like this... I had to scale it a bit to make it fit, I guess that depends on the distance from the camera
creations-chat 2023-05-12 20:25:34 Bruh
creations-chat 2023-05-12 20:37:28 Yea
creations-chat 2023-05-12 20:39:35 I didn't understand
creations-chat 2023-05-12 20:43:37 We have a different thought. I think the RC-135W/V is better because of its nose... I like long-nosed planes like the MC-130
creations-chat 2023-05-12 20:51:24 It is not beautiful?
creations-chat 2023-05-12 20:53:58 That one looks ugly, I like the Original EC-135 better
