creations-chat 2023-07-13 02:03:01 you need to be level 3 on the server
creations-chat 2023-07-13 02:05:50 you need to write to gain experience and thus level up
creations-chat 2023-07-13 02:07:56 If you want to know what level you have go to the central bot and write !rank
creations-chat 2023-07-13 02:10:00 apparently not
creations-chat 2023-07-13 02:16:13 the square windows look good, it is not that it can be solved in a simple way
creations-chat 2023-07-13 02:20:07 But by doing that, wouldn't the hole in the window be too small?

creations-chat 2023-07-13 02:23:00 Have you tried using the wedge 2 yet?
creations-chat 2023-07-13 02:25:51 all are useful or at least most
creations-chat 2023-07-13 02:29:45 And if you put them leaving 1 block of space so that it is consistent with the seats on the other side?
creations-chat 2023-07-13 02:32:24 what plane is it?
creations-chat 2023-07-13 02:35:08 you are on the right track although the cabin does not quite fit or so I see
