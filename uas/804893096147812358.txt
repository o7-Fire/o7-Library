bug-reports 2021-10-02 12:48:11 while doing testing for a competition, I found an issue:

when two things have spawned at the rails, those two things will be treated as if they were black listed. not just that, but you can‚Äôt undo it unless you leave the server
bug-reports 2021-10-04 01:31:32 one creation i have has the problem of when its motor 2‚Äôs are making contact with the body: it will do flips at random intervals

bug-reports 2021-12-13 02:24:37 did you both spawn at the rails at some point? i know that two things spawned at the rails will have no collision. the solution is to have someone leave the sever
