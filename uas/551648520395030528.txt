creations-chat 2022-08-30 13:42:49 uhhh okay im just kinda wondering how your build got so many upvotes because the grain pipe looks kinda weird and the harvester has huge holes near the wheels for suspension i think u were going for the TX32 and ig it kinda looks like it
creations-chat 2022-08-30 13:45:07 uh oh i just realised i broke a part of the harvester lol gotta redo it
creations-chat 2022-08-30 13:48:01 okay ima add weathering on the paint, fix up the grain door, fix up the grain pipe, and do some other detailing

creations-chat 2023-01-06 17:50:26 check my last 4 creations posted on <#384025409945337856>  lol, its all farming machinery
creations-chat 2023-01-06 18:08:15 i was making a quadtrac but it didnt quite turn out as well as i wanted to
creations-chat 2023-01-06 18:10:42 i dont really like modern tractors as much because they are very complicated and have quite a bit of curves and details
creations-chat 2023-01-06 18:22:29 do u have any farming builds saved? if u do, can you show them on dm's (because of timer)
creations-chat 2023-01-06 18:35:10 i sent you a message in dm's please respond
creations-chat 2023-01-07 07:23:35 i will
creations-chat 2023-01-07 23:44:16 opinions on my hardi sprayer?
creations-chat 2023-01-07 23:46:24 the boom can be folded up
creations-chat 2023-01-07 23:48:37 i agree with you on that but I don't really have any idea how to fix them up (possibly replace the emoji with a 2x2 half cylinder)
creations-chat 2023-01-07 23:51:12 the thing is, its how it looks irl. this sprayer is made for usa standards and mostly corn thats why its situated really high up
creations-chat 2023-01-07 23:53:24 no worries thanks for the feedback

i could replace the trail with a bigger block (sparkler maybe) that could possibly make it more accurate to the real image
creations-chat 2023-01-07 23:56:08 jet engine shaft? how do I achieve that
creations-chat 2023-01-07 23:59:55 that could work but one small issue is that i have 1 block of space inbetween the steering motor and the wheel motor
creations-chat 2023-01-08 00:02:09 possibly, but honestly I think the sparkler is just much much easier and has a satisfactory result

thanks for the tips tho ill probably use them in other builds

creations-chat 2023-06-16 17:18:58 okay? mine was suposted to be just for fun, i dont understand why you are so mad lmao (next time make better treads)
creations-chat 2023-06-16 17:23:39 so what you're saying every build should be roscale and no different? ( i also know that it stands for catepillar, we just universally use the short term)
creations-chat 2023-06-16 17:25:54 fun fact, you skid steer is basically roscale. also if i removed all of the markings would you just give up?
creations-chat 2023-06-16 17:28:07 with that, am i suposted to write god damn "CATEPILLAR" on the side of my excavator?
creations-chat 2023-06-16 17:30:11 listen lets say its an offbrand , if you're unsatisfied with the build just give up and tell somebody else about it, i am proud of the thing i built and i will not be listening to your unnecesery criticism. (ive done atleast 10 grammar mistakes in that one sentence)
