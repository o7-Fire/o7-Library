events-chat 2022-02-07 06:05:17 Can't understand people who get worked up about an event that they don't have to participate in
events-chat 2022-02-07 06:05:57 they should be out when send the guy all 3 planes
events-chat 2022-02-07 06:06:16 if we can't get the vid, i'll make sure to get some pics
events-chat 2022-02-07 06:06:57 yes
events-chat 2022-02-07 06:11:25 get rid of the "kinda" from that sentence
events-chat 2022-02-07 06:11:39 perfect
events-chat 2022-02-07 15:29:09 I like the design
events-chat 2022-02-07 16:35:18 How well does it fly
events-chat 2022-02-07 16:36:13 Imagine
events-chat 2022-02-07 16:37:05 One more class Prob soon
events-chat 2022-02-07 16:38:31 rbk is making it
events-chat 2022-02-07 17:31:07 
events-chat 2022-02-07 17:35:27 
events-chat 2022-02-07 17:39:37 I just made a random plane
events-chat 2022-02-07 17:39:54 may or may not be the final class
events-chat 2022-02-07 17:49:18 you're just making modifications to the base aircraft you choose, engine location/type must stay the same
events-chat 2022-02-07 17:49:55 I would wait on the videos before you make them though

events-chat 2022-02-08 06:18:10 thats less than 100 blocks right <@!882419947819638825>
events-chat 2022-02-08 06:21:34 you could use it but I wouldn't really use it
events-chat 2022-02-08 06:21:56 you really only have 4 explosive blocks as your main armament plus the gun
events-chat 2022-02-08 17:07:23 suffering from success
events-chat 2022-02-08 17:20:50 possible reworks for the yousuf
events-chat 2022-02-08 17:26:31 dreams crushed
events-chat 2022-02-08 17:29:54 <@!410455661814480896> can't have the torp though
events-chat 2022-02-08 17:40:22 updates to the yousuf
events-chat 2022-02-08 17:40:24 check it out
events-chat 2022-02-08 17:41:33 not really meta
events-chat 2022-02-08 17:41:45 will get insta killed before it reaches the water
events-chat 2022-02-08 17:42:12 yes
events-chat 2022-02-08 17:43:11 you have to choice from the 3 loadouts
events-chat 2022-02-08 17:43:14 can't have them all
events-chat 2022-02-08 17:44:07 yes
events-chat 2022-02-08 17:45:22 remember when the furry role used to be a thing <:empty:794431705070174238>
events-chat 2022-02-08 17:45:52 yes

events-chat 2022-02-08 17:47:55 no
events-chat 2022-02-08 17:48:37 yes
events-chat 2022-02-08 17:49:19 real
events-chat 2022-02-08 17:49:38 only 130 sps + takes forever to turn but it looks cooler
events-chat 2022-02-08 17:50:44 funny how the planes are pretty similar to the actual ppl based off of them <:trollface:775024642104229898>
events-chat 2022-02-08 17:51:29 sluggish
events-chat 2022-02-08 22:18:10 When you cant read moment
events-chat 2022-02-09 01:55:37 <@!698587744842022983> that doesn't look like a tincan
events-chat 2022-02-09 01:56:59 what happen to the front landing gear also
events-chat 2022-02-09 01:58:26 wth is that
events-chat 2022-02-09 02:42:12 thats only exclusive to the yousuf to rearm with the 4 explosive block loadout
events-chat 2022-02-09 02:45:35 yes
events-chat 2022-02-09 02:45:43 or stay on the ground/water for 10+ secs
events-chat 2022-02-09 02:46:10 main objective of the event is to either damage or 'sink' the carrier though
events-chat 2022-02-09 02:46:13 <@!315262125113081856> no
events-chat 2022-02-09 02:46:36 the bomber is slow/big anyways
events-chat 2022-02-09 02:46:44 no way you're going to make it back to the airport
events-chat 2022-02-09 02:47:12 no
events-chat 2022-02-09 02:55:10 not motor locked
events-chat 2022-02-09 02:55:14 just skill issue on your end
events-chat 2022-02-09 02:55:35 yes
events-chat 2022-02-09 02:55:45 cant spawn anything though
events-chat 2022-02-09 02:56:09 and it only works with one of the loadouts
events-chat 2022-02-09 02:56:38 someone can easily use rockets/firework launchers on it
events-chat 2022-02-09 03:58:06 honestly don't understand why anyone would waste their time trying to use camera/rope locking on a <100 plane
events-chat 2022-02-09 04:27:27 No
events-chat 2022-02-09 04:30:50 Design doesn't even qualify in the first place
events-chat 2022-02-09 04:32:32 When rbk or tin makes them
events-chat 2022-02-09 04:32:53 By the 10th maybe
events-chat 2022-02-09 04:33:20 You can adjust the design of the wing
events-chat 2022-02-09 04:33:29 Cant be radically different though
events-chat 2022-02-09 05:02:52 forgot what it was called
events-chat 2022-02-09 05:03:22 prob that
events-chat 2022-02-09 05:40:13 time isn't final
events-chat 2022-02-09 05:40:16 day is though
events-chat 2022-02-09 17:48:04 thats why you should use the yousuf exclusively on the attacking team

events-chat 2022-02-11 17:59:07 if you find it
events-chat 2022-02-11 18:24:18 event is based off of damage done to the carrier by the attackers + eliminating the enemy team as the defenders
