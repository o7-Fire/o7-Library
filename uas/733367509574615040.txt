creations-chat 2021-11-26 23:16:35 i understand one thing in motor locking and that is that it is to complex for my simple ass brain, I dont like using it in builds, so my challenge to self is to not make motor locked stuff, while adding as much detail.. Note to self, according to <#384025409945337856> nobody likes anything that ain't motorlocked.
