creations-chat 2018-12-02 22:07:53 there's not really an intention to increase the limits or a reason to either

creations-chat 2018-12-03 00:34:02 It is, this is my first small aircraft though so I'm hoping to improve
creations-chat 2018-12-03 00:34:06 And hey it works pretty well
creations-chat 2018-12-03 05:09:07 does chaining my plane to my base make me a plane abuser
creations-chat 2018-12-03 23:42:02 Mosquito|mmm0|210 blocks|597 studs per second max speed|8 second turn time
creations-chat 2018-12-03 23:53:07 M1 Blackout Ground Attack Bomber|699 parts|386 max speed|22 second turn speed

creations-chat 2018-12-03 23:58:05 h0t
creations-chat 2018-12-04 00:00:32 Would a turret work on a plane
creations-chat 2018-12-04 00:00:53 I'm planning on making a plane that'll have a few turrets
creations-chat 2018-12-04 00:01:05 Neato
creations-chat 2018-12-04 00:01:44 Yeah, no doubt. I just want to put a turret on a plane because I personally think it'd look cool.
creations-chat 2018-12-04 00:01:59 It'd be more of a plane to show off than to fight
creations-chat 2018-12-04 00:03:39 I've got the design of my new plane kind of planned, it's gonna have a 40 degree rotating missile launcher under the pilot seat and two MG turrets on each side
creations-chat 2018-12-04 00:03:44 Seems pretty neat
creations-chat 2018-12-04 00:04:01 As said though, fighting with it isn't possible.
creations-chat 2018-12-04 00:06:40 1k is a pain to get to with out using lots of helium or making your plane uncontrollable
creations-chat 2018-12-04 00:07:25 Most I've ever gotten was 400,000 SPS and I just spammed helium blocks and super rockets, Lmao
creations-chat 2018-12-04 00:34:35 my mosquito can turn in a snap xd 

I want to make an Me-262 or Me-410 to get my first replicator rank
creations-chat 2018-12-04 00:35:34 rocket assisted turning ftw
creations-chat 2018-12-04 00:35:59 with out rocket assisted turning my planes would turn awfully
creations-chat 2018-12-04 00:36:52 at the end of the week I want to start on a pretty complicated replica of a B-52
creations-chat 2018-12-04 00:36:58 Or I may wait until bombs are possibly added
creations-chat 2018-12-04 00:37:18 i don't trust downward rockets
creations-chat 2018-12-04 00:37:27 last time i tried i ended up rolling into my rocket
creations-chat 2018-12-04 00:37:56 for my fighter to hit anything with rockets I have to use weird tactics such as using rear facing rockets and fly ahead of the target
creations-chat 2018-12-04 00:38:30 that's bulky
creations-chat 2018-12-04 00:39:41 this game has no armor to begin with lol
creations-chat 2018-12-04 00:40:02 the armor is literally probably plastic
creations-chat 2018-12-04 00:41:02 sounds more like APHE than HEAT
creations-chat 2018-12-04 00:41:23 APHE fires an explosive into a tank, HEAT has no explosive filler
creations-chat 2018-12-04 00:42:07 the name HEAT is very misleading tbh
creations-chat 2018-12-04 00:42:54 the shell doesn't use explosives to penetrate tank armor, it uses explosives to melt metals that are fired into the armor in a narrow stream to penetrate tank amror
creations-chat 2018-12-04 00:42:55 armor
creations-chat 2018-12-04 00:43:06 yes
creations-chat 2018-12-04 00:44:05 they are
creations-chat 2018-12-04 00:44:36 if they were HEAT they would lightly damage an outside block and tear up inner blocks
creations-chat 2018-12-04 01:45:51 T3 Mosquito Model II|mmm0|345 parts|422 max speed with 3 different engine sets to allow for easier targeting when facing targets of varying speeds|oh also functioning turret
creations-chat 2018-12-04 01:50:34 oh, also varying angle rocket launchers for fighting chasing targets or targets that are ahead
creations-chat 2018-12-04 02:25:28 who do I talk to to get ace pilot role
creations-chat 2018-12-04 02:25:47 i have a video file of me going in a vertical climb at 510 SPS for over 10 seconds
creations-chat 2018-12-04 02:49:29 this is from yesterday but can i have orbital velocity
creations-chat 2018-12-04 03:22:40 broke escape velocity
