creations-chat 2021-06-25 00:31:40 so i made a system where you can vary wing sweep without an ugly gap

uses motorlock and a piston to fill the gap, but space it above the moving bit

any thoughts?

<@!751561688393973821> ive put guns and rockets inside the fuselage rn, but i really am more concerned about making it look better
creations-chat 2021-06-28 04:03:07 the 19 is kinda the ugly in between lol

also <@!551806781609869313> i cant really make the intake bigger since size, but i will make the divider thinner

creations-chat 2021-07-15 03:35:02 what does <0 mean

creations-chat 2021-07-15 03:40:01 so its good then
creations-chat 2021-07-21 20:31:03 F7F-3
creations-chat 2021-07-21 22:12:50 i shall use

thx
creations-chat 2021-08-06 04:31:53 welding was fucky, also the one at the tip is just a little control surface for small mouse control
creations-chat 2021-08-06 04:34:16 how was i supposed to make it thinner then???
creations-chat 2021-08-06 04:44:18 already using half wedges
creations-chat 2021-08-06 04:58:38 again, how tf am i supposed to make it smaller


<@!755389462443458611> truuuuue
creations-chat 2021-08-06 05:09:51 that will

1:take brainpower i barely possess

2: not blend well with the rest of the fuselage


also a teeny tiny little intake wont look good
creations-chat 2021-08-06 05:12:31 theres a bunch of motorlock crap that i need to fit in a 3x3 space
creations-chat 2021-08-06 05:15:49 how to fit in smaller space
creations-chat 2021-08-06 05:18:24 to delete the side i'd have to somehow make the entire complicated motor stuff inside 1 wide instead of 3 which is a huuge hassle, also personally i think having a "correct" intake doesnt look better stylistically because its so damn tiny
creations-chat 2021-08-06 05:20:39 in order to get the taper at the tail end right, i have to motorlock+rotate with motor2. this means i have to have a 3 wide at the tail end, and i cant just have a 4 wide tail and a 3 wide body can i
creations-chat 2021-08-06 05:24:38 i dont know how to read what does this mean
creations-chat 2021-08-06 05:28:11 bro the back took me like 5 hours to get right im not gonna do that again

im talking about the jet exhaust bits
creations-chat 2021-08-06 05:32:01 the jet exhaust bits, not the tailplanes
creations-chat 2021-09-02 03:15:10 do it cobra tho

help 2021-11-05 03:52:49 any tips for minimising wobbling in airplanes?
bot-central 2021-11-10 17:00:05 what
bot-central 2021-11-10 17:00:09 ok fair
events-chat 2022-02-01 12:46:20 question? what if my bomber has fixed guns AND a turret?
events-chat 2022-02-01 12:46:57 would it be restricted to a host bomber then?
events-chat 2022-02-01 14:31:16 propellors using motors are allowed yes?
events-chat 2022-02-01 16:56:06 im still confused on the rules about turrets cause i cant read
events-chat 2022-02-01 17:17:19 the rules say “motor2”, can i try a normal motor turret then lmao
events-chat 2022-02-01 17:21:47 alright so the guns must be fixed
events-chat 2022-02-01 17:22:04 does it specify which direction
events-chat 2022-02-01 17:22:49 ive got an idea <:trollface:775024642104229898>
events-chat 2022-02-01 17:23:12 no
events-chat 2022-02-01 18:03:24 either A: manual turret or
B: only pivoting up and down
events-chat 2022-02-01 18:04:29 is it stretching the rules too far
events-chat 2022-02-01 18:05:11 also there is no size limit yes (apart from the plot)?
events-chat 2022-02-01 18:05:33 cause imtoo lazy to make a new plane i might just modify a current one
events-chat 2022-02-01 18:06:08 i am asking too many questions
events-chat 2022-02-01 18:09:41 sooo whats the verdict on that
events-chat 2022-02-01 18:25:03 ?
events-chat 2022-02-01 18:25:19 so only one axis of rotation?
events-chat 2022-02-01 18:31:14 this makes little sense sorry so does it mean only one axis of rotation or? im bad at reading sorry
events-chat 2022-02-03 14:52:59 YB-49 <:trollface:775024642104229898>

events-chat 2022-02-05 18:58:32 if only my plane was actually able to use rockets…
events-chat 2022-02-05 18:59:14 this stupid bug has been driving me crazy why is it refusing to let me use rockets on my PC specifically
events-chat 2022-02-05 19:12:21 my plane looks better with red roundels

events-chat 2022-02-06 20:18:58 the discord poll has much more votes therefore red lost
events-chat 2022-02-06 20:19:44 <@!216193164199985152> wouldnt the 1st vote overcome the 2nd cause it has a lot more votes overall
events-chat 2022-02-06 20:55:02 tf is wrong with twitch chat
events-chat 2022-02-06 21:43:07 air to ground strike when

events-chat 2022-02-07 01:00:04 <@!335599526414909451> do we get punished for NOT using those disconnectors on the side?
events-chat 2022-02-07 01:04:56 i hope one of the planes is a more conventional looking two engined one

i actually happened to make one of those today before i knew of the event
events-chat 2022-02-07 01:09:06 im gonna make the doof cause i like speed
