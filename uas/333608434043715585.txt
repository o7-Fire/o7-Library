creations-chat 2018-12-14 20:11:38 Repost, since I haven't got the Inventor rank I requested for the crane, I would like to know why this is if I am not eligible.

(A summary of what it was meant to do, look up Boeing 747 AAC and you'll know)
creations-chat 2018-12-26 16:07:09 
creations-chat 2018-12-26 16:18:05 ^I request inventor for this one because

Inventor | Build a unique mechanism and use it in one of your creations. Creation must be 500+ blocks in order to qualify.
creations-chat 2019-04-04 17:02:42 As previously, nobody understood what I meant by this, I did about 20 tries trying to land a plane into it and finally got it, The plane fell out almost immediately. (Requesting inventor as I believe nobody has designed one of these before) (Video footage coming after the photo)

creations-chat 2021-04-18 18:08:08 WIP, any suggestions?
creations-chat 2021-04-18 18:10:31 tracks are already separated from the body more than originally intended, and the planned extra detail was ERA on the turret and hull, but I have absolutely no idea how that's done (plus it's already heavily motor-locked)
creations-chat 2021-04-18 18:13:00 i'm quite new to motor-locking/advanced builds to that level, previously the most i'd motor lock is some wings into a gun on an aircraft but i have ***absolutely no idea how it's done***

the only reason it isn't better is because I don't know how to make it better
creations-chat 2021-04-18 18:22:46 don't you love asking for suggestions and just getting "rebuild everything" with no actual explanation on how or what went wrong
very constructive and useful information
creations-chat 2021-04-18 18:50:48 very good, lower wing feels slightly too small though
creations-chat 2021-04-18 18:55:47 ?
creations-chat 2021-04-18 18:59:32 if you mean by design the size of the wing, super's previously mentioned it's based off the Handley Page HP.42, which has a slightly larger lower wing relative to size
