creations-chat 2022-02-03 16:59:35 Shhhhhhhhh, we don't talk about the wheels, still being worked on
creations-chat 2022-02-03 20:46:22 wheels are out of the question, thing is so massive it barely fits in the plot with it's wheels only being 2 blocks wide, also the paint job looks fine No idea what you are talking about? is it the brightness thats not good? please tell me
creations-chat 2022-02-04 17:11:17 Added some real nice texture instead of metal, Please rate? ( I don't want to hear anything about the wheels, if it isn't fabric it's literally uncontrolable)
creations-chat 2022-02-04 17:23:28 atleast tell me what to change, if you hate it so godamn much
creations-chat 2022-02-04 17:36:03 the actual vehicle literally looks like a slightly sloped brick on wheels
creations-chat 2022-02-04 17:38:58 It does, the angle makes it look like a massive brick
creations-chat 2022-02-04 17:41:32 It's on there it was just the angle of the screenshot
creations-chat 2022-02-04 17:45:29 1. Working on the wheels
2. literally turns into a sled with a rocket booster without the fabric texture
3. thank you, I can finally see that it looks off now
creations-chat 2022-02-04 17:48:15 Thanks! also I know in the reference the wheels are really fat and wide, it's just the size of this thing limits the width of the wheels because of the plot size + the folding, otherwise it cannot fold
creations-chat 2022-02-04 17:50:18 Here you go, just 1 exposed motor keeping the entire wheel on
creations-chat 2022-02-04 17:52:46 Alright, thank you very much with some ACTUAL and FACTUAL feedback, you are the 2% of people in this server that doesn't make <#504436696021204992> a dumpster fire
