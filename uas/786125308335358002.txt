help 2022-09-30 02:02:26 I made a biplane bomber from a tutorial but it doesn't seem to lift up because of the weight. People suggested that I should add put in a custom control panel or change the wing and block's material to decrease the density neither kinda work. Any idea how to make my plane abit lighter so it could atleast fly?
