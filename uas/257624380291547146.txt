bug-reports 2020-07-18 00:28:17 Bug:
Hover Thrusters react to ropes (with ignore on and off) and react to your builds.
Their should be a option named "Ignore all" which only detects world builds (terrain, tracks, etc.)

bug-reports 2020-07-18 20:50:40 Hover Thrusters detect ropes.
To elaborate:
Turning on and off "Ignore others" still senses ropes, causing the thrusters to think they are close to the ground, when it is not.
I don't know how to GIF so you can try it out yourself.

help 2020-11-26 21:28:49 Here is a refrence
help 2020-11-26 21:29:08 Need to put a 1x2 engine in a 3x3x4 turbine
help 2020-11-26 21:31:23 I know, its for cosmetic
help 2020-11-26 21:31:58 I want to put the thruster in it, but if there is any other ways to make it work im open
help 2020-11-26 21:32:16 Helicopter propellers dont look to good, and a DIY type look to large
help 2020-11-26 21:34:16 I know, but in terms of looks, its either that, or some cylinders with a half ball at the bottom
help 2020-11-26 21:34:21 Let me try somthing real quick
help 2020-11-26 21:37:17 You can make a spinner, and attach thrusters to a Motor 2, so you can move it
help 2020-11-26 21:37:27 thats about all i got, i never seem to have a use for them
help 2020-11-26 21:38:59 Motor 2 is mouse guided
help 2020-11-26 21:39:16 you can go into third person and drive your new bablade
help 2020-11-26 21:40:17 The ball wheel will let it move without tipping much, the thruster moves it, and the motor 2 move the thruster so you can move it.
help 2020-11-26 21:40:47 let me get a screenshot
help 2020-11-26 21:42:29 
help 2020-11-26 21:42:33 There
help 2020-11-26 21:42:50 Yeah the ball wheel just lets your vehicle move around in a 360 direction, thats it
help 2020-11-26 21:43:04 useless unless you want to make a sled or in my case, a spinning wheel
help 2020-11-26 21:44:30 Yeah, but moving it makes it tip over
help 2020-11-26 21:44:38 its more for stationary
help 2020-11-26 21:44:59 That works good aswell
help 2020-11-26 21:45:13 Back to my question that i need awnsered
help 2020-11-26 21:46:04 What should i replace it with? Motor propellers are great but they are Chunky, i need somthing that has a throttle, not a instant start.
help 2020-11-26 21:46:50 Yeah, but that makes it more chunky
help 2020-11-26 21:47:02 I want a mix of good design and a good functionality
help 2020-11-26 21:47:43 Yeah, super rockets are the best way, but making a shell for it will look weird
help 2020-11-26 21:48:15 acatualy, im going to try somthing
help 2020-11-26 21:48:30 my heli looks like somthing from Halo
help 2020-11-26 21:48:48 i got an idea that will most likely kill me
help 2021-01-17 04:07:46 Looking for a system to launch projectiles like a cannon that is also reloadable, anyone got any ideas?

I perfer it to shoot far also, nothing overly complex.
creations-chat 2021-01-17 04:11:04 <@!313403326081531914> Sorry to bother, but how did you create that launch system?

Been looking and "inventing" for a while, but cant find on as reliable as yours.

Nevermind, i think i see how, Magnets are pushing them.
help 2021-02-24 18:42:18 Suggestions on how to make this turn without Jets/Thrusters/Propellers?
help 2021-02-24 18:43:36 I tried using Hover to turn, but there is no way to set distance exactly
help 2021-02-24 18:44:15 It goes up a block or two, thats just the suspension
help 2021-02-24 18:44:35 It traverses the terrain extreamly well, better than i thought
help 2021-02-24 18:44:46 But the Thruster for turning does not work half the time
help 2021-02-24 18:44:56 I think its because the wheels are fabric
help 2021-02-24 18:45:37 Fabric is the best way to go, keeps the grip
help 2021-02-24 18:45:40 I got an idea though
help 2021-02-24 18:47:55 Yep that did it
help 2021-02-24 18:48:10 Added another motor for turning, configed as twice the speed, works like a charm
help 2021-02-24 19:16:37 
help 2021-02-24 19:16:37 
help 2021-02-24 19:16:39 What do i call this monster?
help 2021-02-24 19:16:55 Its all terrain and floats on water, but i have no name for it
help 2021-02-24 19:20:10 Could do that
help 2021-02-24 19:20:22 What about design advice? still does not have much of a usage
help 2021-02-24 19:20:34 Transport? Search and rescue?
help 2021-02-24 19:22:31 Right now the placeholder name is "Mobile Artic Research Platform (MARP)"
help 2021-02-24 19:22:54 Yeah
help 2021-02-24 19:23:04 Its just a placeholder untill i can find a fitting usage and name
help 2021-02-24 19:23:26 Feels a little to generic
help 2021-02-24 19:23:42 It has a platform on top that can hold a helicopter, but i can put that to another usage
help 2021-02-24 19:24:54 A small/medium helipad
help 2021-02-24 19:25:08 I can add locks for landing gears for medium
help 2021-02-24 19:25:26 Mostly 2-4 seater helicoptes, has to be compact though
help 2021-02-24 19:26:07 Nope
help 2021-02-24 19:26:10 I can renew it though
creations-chat 2021-02-24 20:09:16 I ask myself the same thing.

I tried though, not to great with nose's, thats why i stick to short ones
Plus i made this a few months ago, i wasnt going to post it since i figured it wasnt any good, till somebody told me to
creations-chat 2021-02-24 20:14:06 Any tips or suggestions i should add?
Design or usage would be perfered
bug-reports 2021-02-24 20:15:23 Ladders are extremely heavy for some reason, even for metal material. Can we get this issue fixed?
creations-chat 2021-02-24 20:17:06 Yeah, but be a little more specific.
What kind of paint? (Camo? Solid?)
And what details? (Cargo? Lights?)
help 2021-02-24 20:17:41 Have you tried maxing out torque by the way?
That seems to help in some cases
bug-reports 2021-02-24 20:18:48 allright.
I posted this because my vehicle leaned forward and to the left, i guess the suspension is to weak.
creations-chat 2021-02-24 20:19:22 Like i said, be specific, i need ideas
creations-chat 2021-02-24 20:21:23 I have spotlights in front and back, but i will look at the other stuff.
creations-chat 2021-02-24 20:26:16 Look good, but when i think Sci-fi i think bright colors. I suppose you were looking for a more weathered down look?
creations-chat 2021-02-24 20:30:20 I'd ask what was wrong with my plane earlier (other than the nose) but i know all i'm going to get is "OhHh YoUr BeGgInG fOr LiKeS"
creations-chat 2021-02-24 20:37:27 Its a new player you captured, but im not complaining.
creations-chat 2021-02-24 20:39:41 Any good colors to put on this?
And while i'm at it, any good compact decorations?
creations-chat 2021-02-24 20:42:23 Yeah, im working on it, but what about colors? What color would look well with this?
Its for millitary cargo use (able to hold regualr cargo and a helicopter), mabey a Forest or Winter color?
creations-chat 2021-02-24 20:46:08 One of these, or another Color?
creations-chat 2021-02-24 20:48:53 <@!719168864705052802> Going to be hard, but i will give it a go.
<@!644999827293339661> Right now its for looks, im not going to change it ever so constantly when the season changes.
creations-chat 2021-02-24 20:51:02 <@!719168864705052802> This a good color scheme?
<@!644999827293339661> Please share if your willing, happy to test out diffrent camo's
creations-chat 2021-02-24 20:54:37 How is that for Winter Camo?

<@!719168864705052802> Used the color picker on the snow.
creations-chat 2021-02-24 21:04:26 <@!644999827293339661> Tried that Snow camo
How is it looking
creations-chat 2021-02-24 21:10:29 Yes, but i want a mostly solid color, im dont plan on bringing this into the mountains
creations-chat 2021-02-24 21:21:29 This better?

creations-chat 2021-05-13 20:37:13 I just learn to ignore it, Lot of my great builds get a bunch of dislikes.
Nobody says what the issue is, so i assume they don't care or they just troll

Its best to just like your own build, even if nobody else does. If you put effort into it, its good enough
creations-chat 2021-05-13 20:39:27 That good enough?
34-2 ratio, i'd call that good
Not amazing or god teir, but in my books, if you survive a 75% rating, its good
creations-chat 2021-05-13 20:43:05 I need to stop worrying about making my builds 100% perfect and soft looking.
I scraped about 100 builds because i cannot make a perfect nose
creations-chat 2021-05-13 20:46:54 The issue is its Public.
If you know the internet, its full of people, and its bound to happen a number of them are trolls.

I agree we should suck it up, but if people come here and downvote builds because of reasons not valid to "Is it good" or "Does it work" (etc) then its likely they just dont like the standard. It happend through history with humans, people bite more than they can chew.

But i will end the conversation here. best you all can do is Forgive and forget this.
creations-chat 2021-05-13 20:49:49 Yeah, its the issue with the system. You dont give acatual feedback, and most people dont bother saying what they dont like.

Also, because nobody else said it
