bug-reports 2022-03-08 05:39:21 camera settings keep resetting
bug-reports 2022-03-08 05:39:53 I swear to god I will scream
bug-reports 2022-03-08 16:53:40 like everytime I load in the build after saving its camera settings it literally has its keybind turned back to 1
bug-reports 2022-03-08 19:53:14 I saved it
bug-reports 2022-03-08 19:53:25 just when I loaded back the camera keybinds just suddenly reset

bug-reports 2022-03-28 22:31:42 roblox constantly crashes when I join plane crazy pvp
bug-reports 2022-03-29 01:28:11 no my computer could handle pvp mode pretty well before
bug-reports 2022-03-29 01:28:22 But now it just crashes whenever I go to pvp
bug-reports 2022-03-29 17:48:48 its not an fps/performance issue it literally crashes

creations-chat 2022-09-18 02:33:36 you're gonna get harassed so hard if you post it
save yourself
creations-chat 2022-09-18 02:35:42 he never said it was a tomcat
creations-chat 2022-09-18 03:35:33 you are stupid it appears
bot-central 2022-09-25 16:06:02 ?whois
creations-chat 2022-11-20 01:41:36 So why are they wasting their military resources on untrained troops and not experienced personnel considering they want to take over Ukraine swiftly, your point does not make sense
creations-chat 2022-11-20 01:44:27 then donâ€™t post in PCC
creations-chat 2022-11-20 01:46:48 But they certainly are better than Russian flying shitboxes so they donâ€™t suck as much <:trollface:775024642104229898> 

Iâ€™d much rather fly a gripen or Rafale into combat than use whatever aircraft Russia has
help 2022-11-23 21:38:39 yeah the UAV block basically adds shit like autonomous loitering, automatic targetting, and a bunch of other cool shit
help 2022-11-23 21:39:23 it also has automatic flight correction n shit
