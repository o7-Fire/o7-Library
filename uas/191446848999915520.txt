creations-chat 2019-06-20 03:03:08 mostly T 34 and very little cold war tanks
creations-chat 2019-06-20 03:03:33 I've seen a T90 before but he didn't type in the name so I can't see it again
creations-chat 2019-06-20 03:52:10 In order to kickstart a trend of building Russian tanks, especially cold war era ones, I'm showcasing my T-54/55
creations-chat 2019-06-20 03:52:17 
creations-chat 2019-06-20 04:27:49 just Russian tanks in general
creations-chat 2019-06-20 04:28:21 try searching in the search bar for Russian tanks

creations-chat 2019-06-24 05:56:27 noob turret but more sophisticated
creations-chat 2019-06-24 07:35:10 1x7 beams can't be destroyed by rockets
creations-chat 2019-06-24 07:35:33 what
creations-chat 2019-06-24 07:35:36 but it is
creations-chat 2019-06-24 07:35:51 I did intense testing w/ vietcongambush
creations-chat 2019-06-24 07:36:04 obviously I don't have a video
creations-chat 2019-06-24 07:36:37 beam1x7 can only be destroyed by TNT and machine guns
creations-chat 2019-06-24 07:37:38 what
creations-chat 2019-06-24 07:38:07 i gain no benefit lying about beam 1x7 and it's rocket-proof properties
creations-chat 2019-06-24 07:38:21 how about you do some testing, show me your proof
creations-chat 2019-06-24 07:39:48 mr, that wasn't in a controlled environment
creations-chat 2019-06-24 07:40:57 there could have been other factors
creations-chat 2019-06-24 07:41:04 like machine gun fire
creations-chat 2019-06-24 07:41:48 then, there is no conclusion
creations-chat 2019-06-24 07:42:39 well at least you should know TNT is also indestructible to everything, right?
creations-chat 2019-06-24 07:44:09 I remember shooting very long at someone's maus with TNT armor
creations-chat 2019-06-24 07:44:14 it didn't get destroyed
creations-chat 2019-06-24 07:45:28 also when my vehicles are bombed to oblivion, only the TNT remains
creations-chat 2019-06-24 07:46:40 well yeah
creations-chat 2019-06-24 07:46:56 your own TNT can destroy your own TNT
creations-chat 2019-06-24 07:47:11 that's the only thing that can destroy TNT, your own explosives
creations-chat 2019-06-24 07:49:52 you take this argument too seriously
creations-chat 2019-06-24 07:50:29 anyway I don't believe I am ignorant since ignorant people don't do their own research to find the best block for armoring something
creations-chat 2019-06-24 07:52:01 you are literally the only person I've met to say that they can
creations-chat 2019-06-24 07:52:28 ask mocmish or vietcongambush and they say it can't be destroyed by rockets
creations-chat 2019-06-24 07:54:28 how do we have different experiences
creations-chat 2019-06-24 10:34:00 that's a pretty meh speed for supersonic
creations-chat 2019-06-24 10:34:09 well, "supersonic"
creations-chat 2019-06-24 11:03:13 it's a pretty chonky aeroplane
creations-chat 2019-06-24 11:03:53 if you can remove the 1 layer of bricks on the fuselage, you'd save a lot of weight and also make the plane look a bit better
creations-chat 2019-06-24 15:28:26 chonky
help 2019-06-25 10:44:13 after further research, I've found that beam 1x7 is impervious to direct rocket hits, but if it's in a radius in an explosion of a rocket, it gets slightly damaged or destroyed.
help 2019-06-25 12:17:24 wdym <@456226577798135808>
help 2019-06-25 12:18:08 I can say that rockets act like High-Explosive Squash Head (HESH) if we compare it to real life
help 2019-06-25 12:18:19 In terms of damage, I mean
help 2019-06-25 12:19:34 It blows through weak objects (single blocks) easily. If it doesn't destroy armor/walls, it will damage things behind it.
help 2019-06-25 12:20:27 Single blocks don't have any outstanding properties, except it can be used if you want to minimise damage along a long area
help 2019-06-25 12:21:03 As in, instead of two or three 1x4s being destroyed, 1x1s following explosion radius get destroyed
help 2019-06-25 12:21:19 Materials do affect properties, aside from buoyancy and mass.
help 2019-06-25 12:23:07 Fabric has the most frcition amongst the materials, ice, obviously the least.

When making placing wheels for a vehicle, never put fabric 3x3 cylinders next to each other, they cause too much friction between each other. If possible, use Cylinder2.
help 2019-06-25 12:26:35 TNT is an impervious block to everything too
help 2019-06-25 12:28:23 I recommend making the deck and side armor 1x7 while the frontal portion and also the control surfaces (turret elevation and rotating etc) are protected with TNT
creations-chat 2019-06-25 12:57:35 that is horrible colour
creations-chat 2019-06-25 12:57:52 do you need help, we all can provide better colour codes uk.
creations-chat 2019-06-25 12:58:24 well at least it's petite
creations-chat 2019-06-25 12:59:11 but that colour is no where close to the ausf H from GuP
creations-chat 2019-06-25 12:59:59 but how did he get that driver port, idk any block that small.

creations-chat 2019-06-29 16:07:24 Romania was a large contributor but tiny compared to earth

creations-chat 2019-06-29 16:07:48 Their oil
creations-chat 2019-06-29 16:08:12 Romania was resourcefully more important for Germany in our timeline than Italy
creations-chat 2019-06-29 16:08:49 Hootler was an ok ruler for war
creations-chat 2019-06-29 16:09:06 But if the Natzis weren't Natzis they might've won
creations-chat 2019-06-29 16:09:20 They could've gotten the help of the Ukrainian but nope they gotta kill them
creations-chat 2019-06-29 16:09:58 His Generals were also quite naive when invading Russia
creations-chat 2019-06-29 16:10:00 SOMEHOW
creations-chat 2019-06-29 16:10:33 Can't believe Hootler was actually right for invading the Caucasus instead of going for Moscow
creations-chat 2019-06-29 16:11:09 Technically he was right
creations-chat 2019-06-29 16:11:13 But he couldn't win
creations-chat 2019-06-29 16:11:22 If he waited he'd get his ass kicked by Russia
creations-chat 2019-06-29 16:11:54 By waiting he'd die even faster
creations-chat 2019-06-29 16:12:13 By not waiting he Might've won but they just couldn't
creations-chat 2019-06-29 16:13:01 Imagine if Hootler took power 6 years earlier
creations-chat 2019-06-29 16:13:20 The Soviets in 1920 were so industrially weak they lost to an offensive war against Poland
creations-chat 2019-06-29 16:13:54 If Hootler wasn't a Natzi and a warmonger he would've been a good leader
creations-chat 2019-06-29 16:14:03 Their generals are good
creations-chat 2019-06-29 16:14:12 They just put the wrong people
creations-chat 2019-06-29 16:14:29 They literally were steam rolling in 1940 after they rotated the generalship
creations-chat 2019-06-29 16:15:03 Also in the continuation war Finland would've been destroyed if they didn't surrender
creations-chat 2019-06-29 16:15:37 I'm sure if Hootler exploited the fearmongering of Stalinism he could've incited riots
creations-chat 2019-06-29 16:15:53 But he's a Natzi and they are politically blind
creations-chat 2019-06-29 16:16:55 I wonder if he would massacre the Iranians
creations-chat 2019-06-29 16:17:15 Iran is a literal anglicisation of the word Aryan uk
