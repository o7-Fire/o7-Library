creations-chat 2022-01-26 14:01:11 pcc moment
creations-chat 2022-02-06 14:25:27 hell, to the yes
creations-chat 2022-05-23 00:33:20 it honestly looks like an f-14 without the wing sweep
creations-chat 2022-05-23 00:51:06 and that’s why you don’t post in plane crazy
creations-chat 2022-05-23 00:52:48 I can neither confirm nor deny
creations-chat 2022-05-23 00:55:02 I probably post su-35 here sooner or later
creations-chat 2022-05-24 00:16:31 coming sooner or later (or never)
creations-chat 2022-05-24 00:31:07 is su-35
creations-chat 2022-05-24 00:33:43 I can't tell if it's the angle, but the top of the nose looks flat
creations-chat 2022-05-24 01:17:19 I’m just starting from the back cause thrust vectoring
creations-chat 2022-07-08 13:49:30 the most civil plane crazy conversation
creations-chat 2022-08-18 20:18:03 color kinda inconsistent don’t you think
creations-chat 2022-09-16 10:07:37 it is TALL
creations-chat 2022-09-27 19:35:08 the expectation is to make something that isn’t disproportionate
creations-chat 2022-09-27 19:52:56 honestly looks worse than the tutorial
