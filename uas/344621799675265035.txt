creations-chat 2020-11-05 15:19:05 So I would have made a better set of shots but I couldn’t so I will check on discoed for my pc again when my school is done.

creations-chat 2020-11-05 15:25:49 > How do I add tension to these tracks (Stretch what)
<@456226577798135808>   Just use some suspension with max strength and length. Make sure to put it at points where the axles are separate
creations-chat 2020-11-05 15:31:01 Essentially you are just making the front wheels tense up the tread and making it not pinch
creations-chat 2020-11-07 17:15:43 This is with no intake
creations-chat 2020-11-07 17:18:02 this is the intake. is it to bulky
creations-chat 2020-11-07 17:19:35 and is the fade color good or should i trash it and make it something else?

creations-chat 2020-11-07 21:06:05 people make what they friggin want tho
creations-chat 2020-11-07 21:07:45 If they want a battlestar galactica, they can make their battlestar galactica. If they want rice, they can make rice. If they want an egg that blows people up, they can make them self a dern egg that blows people up

creations-chat 2020-11-07 21:14:37 Imagine caring about your own open opinion of someone else's creativity so much that you lose sight of what you think is good and become a terrible human person with a terrible personality and start shaming people who just wanted to share what they took time to create and just have a fun time.
creations-chat 2020-11-07 21:17:18 Tbh i dont really care to get a rank so...

creations-chat 2020-11-07 21:19:13 well that doesnt matter what the plane looks like. If it can stay in the freakin air, and can move in it, its a frign plane

creations-chat 2020-11-07 21:24:40 To answer your question, Ch0mega, if its a propellor-powered machine, the same counts.
creations-chat 2020-11-07 21:30:14 aight ima head out of this server. <@!683105477000822875>  i hope you will continue the good work and i will challenge you to put literally as many wings as you can fit onto your plane because thats what made it so stable. Have fun building, and don't take this trash talk too personally. they have different standards.
