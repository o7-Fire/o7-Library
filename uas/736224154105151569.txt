creations-chat 2022-05-26 13:12:17 What’s wrong <:ElonSad:573361014112780303>
creations-chat 2022-05-26 13:17:15 Man I’ve literally said it’s just a camo 😭 since Ukraine don’t have any bmp2m berezoks
creations-chat 2022-05-26 15:15:32 That’s the camouflage 💀
creations-chat 2022-05-26 15:24:35 People are building German tanks with let’s say bad signs and noone basically cares 🤩
creations-chat 2022-05-26 15:41:47 Let’s just stop this and I’ve already confirmed that I was not right
creations-chat 2022-05-26 16:14:22 Russian camouflage + signs
creations-chat 2022-05-26 16:47:46 I’ve already said like 3 times, I’ve changed a camo
creations-chat 2022-05-26 16:50:29 Do you fricking read my messages? And no one really cares about the “bad German sign” on German builds🤩
creations-chat 2022-05-26 16:52:31 No one cares about it in chat, but all cares about Z in chat, (ok, except maybe 5 people) wow🤩
