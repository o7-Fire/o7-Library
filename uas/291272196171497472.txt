Gun Changes

Building

Allow the modification of guns, and allow us to colour the yellow bit.
Modification would include: changing rate of fire, length of yellow part (simulating a barrel), and 2 new parts; the Ball Gun and Swivel Gun
The ball gun would be a half 1x1 ball, with a gun on the end. It would be able to move in all directions in a 180Â° cone
The swivel gun would look similar to the Panzer IV or Tiger I frontal machine guns, in which they would swivel along the X/Z axis
