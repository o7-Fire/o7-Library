bug-reports 2020-08-20 18:59:53 After doing an experiment with a squadron of jets, i figured out the main source of lag when it comes to making planes, wing panels. dunno why tho, maybe look into it
bug-reports 2020-08-20 19:00:31 prob the source of lift and logic applied
bug-reports 2020-08-20 19:03:04 magnets are almost completely broken, we need more options, and a huge revamp on them
