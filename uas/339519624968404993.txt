help 2018-09-27 15:05:41 and *please* don't ping madattak because someone is copying your creation ;-;
help 2018-09-27 22:23:53 haha RIP
help 2018-10-02 14:58:22 please stop keeping your design 'secrets' to yourself. when I uncover something new, i don't go into a private server and keep it all to myself - I tell people about it and how to use it. there is honestly no point in keeping creations and designs to yourself - if someone 'steals' it then why on earth is it a problem?
help 2018-10-02 16:11:46 i'm not deciding whether you share it or not. i'm just saying it's a rash and illogical thing to do with no point to it
help 2018-10-02 16:13:21 i know, i just really disapprove of it... i hate it when people do that.
help 2018-10-02 16:13:49 i mean, the 'tech level' of plane crazy didn't evolve because of people who didn't share concepts with one another
help 2018-10-02 16:15:19 what? i'm not trying to force you to share your creation
help 2018-10-02 16:15:40 i belive it's 8 or 9

the-dump 2018-10-06 19:38:21 hyperant?
the-dump 2018-10-06 20:16:36 yes this guy is really toxic
the-dump 2018-10-06 20:16:47 this is clearly going to be happening a lot from now on
the-dump 2018-10-06 20:16:51 only on the discord

the-dump 2018-10-06 20:17:04 there is a admin script but only mad has access

the-dump 2018-10-06 20:18:27 i mean, i'd log on and greet whoever was on and there'd be some sort of conversation about aerodynamics or the like
the-dump 2018-10-06 20:18:35 now screaming 9yos ;/
the-dump 2018-10-06 20:19:00 good point, which probably means we should NOT ban him
the-dump 2018-10-06 20:19:09 they'll just get angrier
the-dump 2018-10-06 20:19:14 and probs get revenge on an alt
bug-reports 2018-10-07 14:13:50 the scrollbar for the normal blocks section needs extending
bug-reports 2018-10-07 16:33:40 colours appear to sometimes load incorrectly
bug-reports 2018-10-07 16:33:46 like, alter slightly
bug-reports 2018-10-07 16:35:27 for example I used 40,40,40
bug-reports 2018-10-07 16:35:36 and got something more like 20,20,40
bug-reports 2018-10-07 16:41:30 can't roblox convert Color3's to BrickColors?
bug-reports 2018-10-07 16:41:43 direectly?
bug-reports 2018-10-07 16:45:22 couldn't you make it more efficient by getting the colours of the blocks and only saving one hex value for each color on the craft? then giving each block a two letter identifier and loading the colors according to that?
bug-reports 2018-10-07 16:47:02 so like, if a craft has [255, 255, 255] and [0, 0, 0]
bug-reports 2018-10-07 16:47:20 and those are the only colors on all of its blocks
bug-reports 2018-10-07 16:47:40 no i didn't mean like that
bug-reports 2018-10-07 16:47:59 so say, my carrier has [255, 255, 255] and [0, 0, 0] on it
bug-reports 2018-10-07 16:48:07 those are the only two colors i put on the craft
bug-reports 2018-10-07 16:48:28 it saves those colors to storage and labels them with two letters, for example black it labels HG and white FV
bug-reports 2018-10-07 16:48:57 and every black block gets assigned the letters HG and every white gets labelled FV
bug-reports 2018-10-07 16:49:07 then when it's loaded, it just loads the data for those two colors
bug-reports 2018-10-07 16:49:20 and it paints all the blocks according to their two letter code
bug-reports 2018-10-07 16:49:51 it would allow for 676 different colors on a craft with only two letters, too
bug-reports 2018-10-07 16:51:42 what do you think? it would decrease the amount of data you'd have to use by several times
bug-reports 2018-10-07 16:51:51 so you could save colors accurately
bug-reports 2018-10-07 18:34:59 propellers are actually the most space efficient engines, i believe
bug-reports 2018-10-08 21:54:22 (that one only appeared recently)

bug-reports 2018-10-13 23:17:45 if anyone has had a bug where their creation won't save, please press F9, scroll right down to the bottom and check if there is a error talking about a load script timing out. if there is a error, please tell me. i need more people to confirm this bug so i know whether i should post it in <#490306593242611742> or not. thanks
bug-reports 2018-10-13 23:27:05 yeah i noticed that when i was on rick's test server
bug-reports 2018-10-13 23:27:17 it just subtracts one block from the actual amount of blocks on the craft
bug-reports 2018-10-13 23:27:22 for some reason
bug-reports 2018-10-14 01:09:43 yep, the problem is that if you place a block and then delete it, the move tool will act as if it's still there
the-dump 2018-10-14 01:10:03 lmao
the-dump 2018-10-14 01:10:14 why on earth...
help 2018-10-14 12:48:31 i think don't build over 700-800 blocks

bug-reports 2018-10-14 13:37:15 yah rick's looking into it
bug-reports 2018-10-14 13:37:32 he thinks it just *might* be because of, you know, that 75k line script he put it
bug-reports 2018-10-14 13:50:31 yesterday i thought i had saved the third stage of my saturn V
bug-reports 2018-10-14 13:50:36 and guess what it didn't save

bug-reports 2018-10-15 15:23:25 yes, i do get lag
bug-reports 2018-10-15 15:44:28 or how about we just solve the problem by disabling welding for magnets and create a separate block capable of welding?
bug-reports 2018-10-15 18:17:59 it's either an easter egg or a bug, no one knows which

help 2018-10-26 20:59:43 basically all you need to do is
1) build a normal plane body/wings, but without engines
2) place 2 motors on either side of your plane. >>> THEY MUST BE ALIGNED WITH THE YELLOW(and preferably blue) LINES <<< [very important]
3) place upward facing engines on those motors
4) configure the motor on the right to be the inverse keybinds of the motor on the left
help 2018-10-26 20:59:51 start small, <30 blocks

help 2018-10-26 21:24:27 i stayed pretty low down... well, not really. i built planes. plasma bombers upon plasma bombers. screw helicopters.
creations-chat 2018-10-26 21:51:40 1) the craft must be 500+ blocks to qualify
2) what on earth is so special about building a straight plane with big wings
creations-chat 2018-10-26 21:51:52 you need to build something that has a new mechanism, or something of the sort
creations-chat 2018-10-26 21:52:00 inventor rank is special for a reason

the-dump 2018-10-29 21:09:28 i can't really do anything unless you send me picture proof that someone's copying you
the-dump 2018-10-29 21:11:42 yah it's a very original design
the-dump 2018-10-29 21:15:53 frankly i don't think that's a problem. unless ash starts claiming it as his own or something like that, there's no point in taking action
the-dump 2018-10-29 21:17:12 i've actually copied a few concepts personally that i thought cool, like a interesting walker design i saw in <#384025409945337856>
the-dump 2018-10-29 21:17:22 but i didn't post them anywhere or claim them as my own
the-dump 2018-10-29 21:17:27 no.
the-dump 2018-10-29 21:17:46 is someone trying to claim a copied creation as their own?
the-dump 2018-10-29 21:19:53 yes. copying in itself is fine, unless the creator has a really massive problem with it for a good reason, claiming it as your own is not fine.

bug-reports 2018-10-30 23:30:17 when you press it doesn't matter
help 2018-10-31 16:00:48 unless people post a creation that is originally yours and claim it as their own, there really is no point getting aggravated about copying creations. as xpert said it happens all the time, and it doesn't really affect anything

help 2018-10-31 22:44:08 it *is* unique, but it's pretty simple... idk
help 2018-10-31 22:46:10 i'm really quite stuck. it is new but simple, and not a new mechanism, just a new look

help 2018-10-31 22:48:29 my thoughts exactly, actually

help 2018-11-01 17:23:46 yah, when i built my saturn V i used split joints and built it lengthwise. then it stood up using large rocket engines
help 2018-11-01 17:23:59 i recommend doing that for larger builds
creations-chat 2018-11-01 18:23:16 i haven't seen any examples so far
creations-chat 2018-11-01 18:23:49 yeah, i vote yes for a reset
creations-chat 2018-11-01 18:24:09 this is why we need a #polls channel i've asked a few times but xpert seems to be against it
creations-chat 2018-11-01 18:24:45 yeah, i also think it should be for *only new mechanisms* not for new looks
creations-chat 2018-11-01 18:24:53 it's really easy to build, say, a flying apple or whatever
creations-chat 2018-11-01 18:25:06 looks play a big part though

help 2019-01-18 16:29:35 in other words, another rotor with equal energy spinning the other way
help 2019-01-18 19:08:34 in the early days, there were no rules about copying, it was very loose
help 2019-01-18 19:08:50 but we started getting too many complaints and too many arguments were started
help 2019-01-18 19:09:07 so in the end we just had to implement sort-of-official rules around it
help 2019-01-18 19:10:02 and yeah, i must say that don't particularly like how most builds are a copy. there's quite a decline in creativity
help 2019-01-18 19:11:41 when plane crazy was much younger i do remember seeing a lot more original builds. i suppose the painting tool was a little more supportive of replications over original builds
help 2019-01-18 20:25:38 if someone has given permission, of course we won't take action. usually we don't take action either(not that i've seen) if the person getting angry hasn't asked 'can you please not copy my thingy.' we basically made it a rule because so many people actually wanted it as a rule
help 2019-01-18 20:26:31 and yes, plane crazy does have quite a steep learning curve. however i've seen way too many cases of people copying 800-part-creations and in some cases even trying to submit them as their own...

help 2019-01-18 23:04:28 control surfaces coordinate based on the centre of mass/lift of the plane. this means that planes need control surfaces right at the back to be able to pitch, and in the middle to be able to roll
help 2019-01-18 23:04:42 it also means that yawing surfaces are most effective right at the back
help 2019-01-18 23:05:14 send a screenshot
help 2019-01-18 23:05:40 it sounds like your plane doesn't have control surfaces in line with the centre of mass at the middle of the plane to me
help 2019-01-18 23:13:01 oh. that's just the nature of mouse control. it doesn't let your plane go inverted, just points it based on where your mouse is. you can't really get that sort of performance on mouse controls
help 2019-01-18 23:13:17 some people prefer mouse, some prefer keyboard
help 2019-01-18 23:13:58 it's basically because the amount mouse control tilts your surfaces is based on where your mouse is
help 2019-01-18 23:14:06 meaning they're basically never tilted fully
help 2019-01-18 23:14:19 but keyboard control tilts them fully as soon as you press the key

bug-reports 2019-02-26 00:13:00 some things can't be fixed simply due to the way the game is coded
bug-reports 2019-02-26 00:13:21 well, they can but it'd take a huge amount of effort
bug-reports 2019-02-26 00:14:34 and some would just require a total rewrite. which is what we need right now, but mad is the only one with the knowledge to do it who might actually rewrite it, but he's too busy with his jobs and things
bug-reports 2019-02-26 00:19:29 although tbh it's a miracle someone figured out how to add on to it. the code's messy, not very well documented.
bug-reports 2019-02-26 00:19:55 a lot of it will just remain unmodified forever because no one knows how the hell it works

the-dump 2019-02-27 17:29:21 tree that literally reloads all chunks around it when it grows
bug-reports 2019-02-27 21:59:24 i think that's a known bug but honestly, why fix it? it's kinda interesting to have these smaller features around. You can do the same with ballast beams >> ballasts which is really useful
creations-chat 2019-02-28 18:44:50 yes
help 2019-03-01 22:53:09 a longer explanation: each block takes up save data based on what numbers it actually needs to save. for example, a normal block or wedge needs to store X, Y and Z in position in the world, its rotation information and 1-4 digits as a BrickColor. a motor will additionally need to save 2-8 digits for colour as it has two parts, and also its settings(powered, speed, torque, controls) and so on

help 2019-03-07 22:04:23 it does it automatically
help 2019-03-07 22:04:52 but only within a certain range. if the rocket passes too far away from your target, it won't lock on
help 2019-03-07 22:21:34 you don't
help 2019-03-07 22:21:49 and it's not how close you are, but how close the rocket gets
help 2019-03-07 22:30:23 i don't know the exact mechanics, but it's possible there's a delay for locking on, so there's a minimum range as well. not for certain though, it could just be roblox's bad physics or something

the-dump 2019-03-27 16:28:57 the reason we don't allow discussions about religion is because more often than not it ends in a heated argument. and since people's minds are very difficult to change, typically it's only ended by intervention.

help 2019-03-29 22:48:27 one helium = about 8 **normal** blocks worth of lift so you'd want... maybe 20-40 blocks? depends largely on your crafts block composition
help 2019-03-29 22:51:47 i think they reduce *overall* weight btw

help 2019-03-29 22:52:04 unless that part will be separated
help 2019-03-29 22:52:20 nah, it just reduces overall weight

help 2019-04-20 23:40:43 uh, can't be sure
help 2019-04-20 23:40:49 possibly
help 2019-04-20 23:41:20 yah, question is if it saves the default colour

help 2019-04-28 12:07:44 <@323414243074506763> keep in mind that control surfaces to the sides will favour rolling, and control surfaces to the back/front will favour pitching. basically put more control surfaces at the back if you want more pitching(therefore sharper turns)

creations-chat 2019-06-03 19:59:10 the Dystoria, a cargo ship created for high endurance cargo transport through industrialized regions. Patented in 2043 for use in low-risk regions, it is a cheap ship for its size, and has a weak hull, meaning torpedoes and underwater armament are a prevalent threats. All cargo is stored below the waterline, allowing for cold store materials to be easily stowed. The top section features specialized storage facilities and not unreasonably comfortable living quarters. The craft is powered using high efficiency fuel cells, resulting in a very low speed of 5.5kts, but very low refuel cost.

creations-chat 2019-06-06 22:17:31 The industrial flagship 'Steelmouth' is an enormous behemoth even for its time, It sails from port to port, buying, processing and selling resources. The ship features an array of industrial complexes and has crew quarters below decks. The ship was commissioned in 2053 and continues to roam the oceans to this day. The light armament, however, means huge vulnerability to pirates, and slow speed make it extremely susceptible to traditional threaten-and-pillage tactics. This resulted in a small VTOL pad being installed above a storage room, which can hold two small offensive VTOLS capable of taking out threats at a respectable distance. The ship 
 uses a large diesel engine which powers the propellers and supplies power for all industrial processes.
creations-chat 2019-06-06 22:18:21 The front of the ship has a crane for loading and unloading small packages onto a miniature rail network spanning the ship, and a well armoured control room.
creations-chat 2019-06-06 22:18:54 Behind the control room sits the refinery, where oil products are slowly cracked over the journey. Most of the ships fuel is made in this way.
creations-chat 2019-06-06 22:19:55 Towards the centre of the ship sits a light VTOL runway and hastily built control room for VTOL's, above a storage room used for repair tools and ammunition.
creations-chat 2019-06-06 22:21:07 The engine utilizes a fuel line running through the VTOL pad for refuelling, and uses a high-efficiency diesel engine. A lot of output goes toward generating power, as the electrical needs of such a ship are very high.
creations-chat 2019-06-06 22:22:07 At the rear is an industrial complex featuring a blast furnace and casting channels, and a small assembly unit.
creations-chat 2019-06-06 22:24:16 The blast furnace is a very skilful piece of engineering, running at over a thousand degrees. Concerns about the wooden deck were voiced, and the room now has a floor of metal. The blast furnace is a very prominent feature of the ship, and uses lighter fuel products to blast oxygen into the furnace.
creations-chat 2019-06-06 22:25:13 Right at the back is a modular casting room used for custom orders and precise casting.

creations-chat 2019-06-10 19:43:56 1) Front wings definitely don't look like they belong there, I would suggest just moving the rear wings forward
2) You might want to try and build a bit smoother. It is possible to build detailed and smooth at the same time, as I've found out recently, and they generally look better
3) Engines look a bit odd like that, with the mount offset. I suggest building custom engines using half blocks and then putting the real engines in the interior

help 2019-07-07 18:03:24 if it's causing problems, use ballasts to one side of your ship... it's likely because you have something or other offset on top
help 2019-07-07 18:08:16 i highly doubt that it's actually going to cause any problems. if i were you I would just leave it - if it's a folding ship it's going to be off centre no matter what
help 2019-07-07 18:13:08 oh.
help 2019-07-07 18:13:26 the center of mass being offset is not the problem
help 2019-07-07 18:14:21 the problem is that it's too high. if the center of mass is above the waterline, the ship is liable to tipping over. I would replace the beams at the bottom of the ship with ballasts set as high as possible
help 2019-07-07 18:14:44 but keep in mind that the ballast setting does NOT reflect on the position of the yellow ball

creations-chat 2019-07-07 18:56:20 This is Orion Arbitar IV.

The multi-stage rocket is capable of interplanetary flights to every planet in our solar system. Advances in fuel and engine technology have made it possible to lift such a heavy payload with such a comparatively small rocket, allowing for efficient vacuum based engines to provide most overall thrust.

The launchpad has a suspended circular base to evenly distribute the rockets weight and allow for maintenance to take place. The launch tower has few facilities, acting mostly as a support arm to steady the rocket. Fuelling and loading is mostly done by drones.
creations-chat 2019-07-07 18:56:46 The four massive first stage engines are incredibly efficient, burning pressurized high-grade fuel. Black stripes mixed with dark red line the first stage - despite technology nullifying the need for them, it was decided to uphold tradition.
creations-chat 2019-07-07 18:57:00 Once the first stage's fuel has been depleted, the fairing around the second stage engine is deployed and the engine activated. The second stage uses a fairly nondescript vacuum suited engine, which is used to complete orbit circulisation and burns a even higher grade liquid fuel.
creations-chat 2019-07-07 18:57:20 Fairing is deployed as soon as the craft is in orbit. The fairing is composed of 30 pieces, each separated and immediately pulled away from the craft by low thrust solid boosters. Each piece de-orbits after a period of weeks, while the main payload continues its journey.
creations-chat 2019-07-07 18:57:42 The mothership uses highly efficient nuclear engines, burning low density specialized fuel stored in high-pressure containers inside the ship. Once a transfer burn has successfully been executed, the crew will go into the cryogenic bay at the tip of the mothership, where they will remain in sleep until their destination is reached.
creations-chat 2019-07-07 18:57:46 lmao
creations-chat 2019-07-07 18:57:46 halfway point
creations-chat 2019-07-07 18:58:12 Typically, the crew will wake just hours before descent is imminent - the craft will be controlled by an on-board computer in their absence. The standard procedure is to set the entire craft on a collision course with the target planetary body, release the lander and burn engines to re-enter orbit. The lander then fires its rockets to slow down before a gentle touchdown. All of this is controlled by the mothership's computer.
creations-chat 2019-07-07 18:58:38 After everything is cleared up on the surface, the ascent module is separated from the landing module to return to the mothership. In this case the module is an atmospheric variant, switching to small inline rocket boosters once the main engines have flamed out. Usually, ascent is timed to allow for an optimal rendezvous window.
creations-chat 2019-07-07 18:58:57 When the two craft are close enough and relative speed has been nullified, docking can begin. The two craft are configured to always be pointing at each other, and when they get close enough docking magnets will be activated to ensure accurate docking.
creations-chat 2019-07-07 18:59:17 The crew are then placed into cryogenic sleep again for the return journey. More often than not the planets will be in a sub-optimal position for a return transfer, so the mothership tends to come back with depleted fuel tanks. Usually several high altitude aerobraking maneuvers will be done before re-entry to slow the craft to acceptable speeds. The mothership calculates a re-entry course, aligns the orbit appropriately and sends the capsule on its way.
creations-chat 2019-07-07 18:59:39 The capsule can withstand both ground and water landings, using two parachutes set into the sides. As soon as the capsule has touched down, the door will be jettisoned and a recovery team can come to search for the capsule.

contest-info 2019-08-15 19:45:47 ***CONTEST POLL***
What contest should we do this week?
1⃣ `Dystopian themed builds(Any vehicle or building but must look dystopian)`
2⃣ `Interplanetary mothership builds(Made to travel from planet A to B over a long period of time)`
3⃣ `Industrial builds(Any type of vehicle or building, but must look industrial)`
4⃣ `UFO builds(Typical round representation)`
contest-info 2019-08-15 21:25:06 To clarify, since industrial builds is in the lead, your build may consist of either a real life factory segment(s) like blast furnaces and oil cracking towers, or fictional designs - both must clearly look as if they are used in manufacturing/industry but function is not required.
contest-info 2019-08-15 21:25:46 Simply put, build anything you want but it must look like it's used for industrial purposes
creations-chat 2019-08-15 21:27:37 Good concept, try detailing it a bit more
creations-chat 2019-08-15 21:28:21 And try building cylinders from blocks in the half blocks category, they are often better looking and more flexible

bug-reports 2019-08-21 17:36:43 had to deal with that a lot several months ago when trying to make a fast controllable craft... No rockets or magnets then so it was much harder to do with wings. definitely might be worth looking into

the-dump 2019-08-22 21:17:38 Well actually not in the past few weeks
the-dump 2019-08-22 21:17:49 Because I've been travelling a lot
the-dump 2019-08-22 21:18:18 No, and won't be able to get on until about a week and 3 days
the-dump 2019-08-22 21:20:18 What I basically did was design the ranks, go to the alps, then flew back and spent until about 2am building a factory for the contest, then flew to the Czech Republic at 6am tired as fuck
the-dump 2019-08-22 21:22:42 Also decided to take over the contests because voxel wasn't posting anything and plus I wanted people to try and build original things for once
the-dump 2019-08-22 21:22:59 So far it's turned out better than I expected actually
the-dump 2019-08-22 21:39:50 Yeah lumber Inc broke a while baxk

the-dump 2019-08-22 21:42:37 I had this argument once with a guy who wanted to votekick me because I was 'not doing any real work, just pushing around logs in a bulldozer',
the-dump 2019-08-22 21:43:14 Ngl I didn't realise it was bait but I was hecking new to the whole internet thing back then

contest-info 2019-09-03 16:24:35 ```WEEKLY CONTEST```

`OBJECTIVES`
- Build a 'terrain scene.' The definition for this contest is a collection of related objects presented on terrain or any other such setting. For instance, a 'fortress' scene might include a main building in the centre of the map with multiple objects such as ammunition crates, turrets, fences, etc scattered around. Scenes can also be in various environments(not necessarily from real life though), for instance a 'sea' setting with a school of fish, small island with a lighthouse, sailing ship, fin to indicate shark, etc.

`RESTRICTIONS`
- Scene must be over 300 blocks
- Scene must contain at least 5 different objects unless it's largely terrain-focused

`INSTRUCTIONS`
 - Post your submission to <#609381270237216768> where it will automatically be reposted to <#609381333243920384> to be voted on. You may only submit one creation. Three winners will be chosen, and there will be no voting period so don't wait last minute to post.
- Moderators reserve the right to remove any submissions deemed to break the contest rules or be off-topic.

`DATES`
Contest closes on 10/9/19 at 20:00 GMT. I will post a reminder before then but make sure to have your creation ready by that date.

creations-chat 2019-09-03 19:18:37 now, as for advice
creations-chat 2019-09-03 19:19:56 needs a more consistent colour scheme imo, more colour applied to hull as well. slightly more detailing still needed, for instance different style wedges. also the superstructure imo should have a different ending <@!435464209677942784>
creations-chat 2019-09-03 19:20:40 actually tbh i'm not entirely sure about the ending
creations-chat 2019-09-03 19:21:00 don't build ships that much
creations-chat 2019-09-03 19:21:32 but i would encourage trying different tones of that grey, maybe R/G/B to contrast it

creations-chat 2019-09-04 15:14:23 i actually struggled quite a bit when the half blocks/wedges all came out
creations-chat 2019-09-04 15:15:36 can you show me an example?

the-dump 2019-09-26 18:02:15 here's some random lore i wrote a while back

Drether is an aircraft and spacecraft design firm, specialising in applying new technology and concepts to its craft. Most of its builds are completely original rather than following the standard formula for what vehicles should look like, resulting in quite a signature look.
The company was started in 2044 following the failure of fusion power and invention of efficient atmospheric rocket thrusters. The first aircraft were attempts to build fast, nimble VTOLs capable of fast personnel transport. After several successful designs, efforts were moved to larger, more powerful cargo VTOLs designed for flying to remote locations. These VTOLs were ordered by several large companies, and turned out to be a large success.
Since then, focus has moved to creating original designs and practical craft. More focus has also been put into designing SSTOs as the concept turned out to be highly successful following multiple launches(and landings) by high-profile companies. The reusability of the craft also work in favour of Drether, and in 2057 an orbital shipyard was constructed with these SSTOs for their own purposes.
Inventions of new technology have also proven useful in innovation efforts. In 2054, a scientist working for a magnet group discovered a way to create motion of a structure using a magnet on the same structure, something previously thought to break the laws of physics. The setup, however, required a huge amount of power, meaning it was almost useless. Despite this, scientists at Drether's space division saw the potential in a spacecraft using this technology, and within just a few months spacecraft were flying powered by only solar energy.
_ _

the-dump 2019-09-26 18:02:26 The concept was heavily criticized, being called 'a less powerful form of ion' by a number of research groups, but major breakthroughs in the technology surrounding this concept were made in 2055. Commercialisation of the technique was now in sight, and the first magnet-powered VTOL was created just 5 months later. The VTOL was a very small design capable of transporting light cargo and nothing more, and could only fly for under an hour without recharging. Technology continued to improve and the first human carrying magnet VTOL was released in 2057.
Major drawbacks, however, were reached following the crash of three magnet VTOLs over civilian areas within the same month. Several weeks of investigation followed and it was discovered that a specific frequency of radio signal that had recently come into use for the purposes of different experiments in propulsion technology could intervene with the delicate technology that channelled the power created by the magnets. Not wanting to halt research on new propulsion, a mass recall of the craft followed, and large and costly changes were made to the channelling system.

the-dump 2019-09-26 18:02:39 Efforts started moving toward building larger craft. By now, transporting goods was incredibly cheap, easy and with no environmental cost thanks to magnet technology combined with solar. Some of the largest craft ever built were released the following year, most notably its record breaking 300-metre long and 40 metre wide flying fortress. An enormous  flying aircraft carrier was also built, and despite not being the first made headlines around the world thanks to its size, efficiency and capacity.
Development was also coming to the point where a craft could stay in the air indefinitely using solar technology without recharging. At this point Drether's best ships were in the air for a maximum of 54 hours before recharging, presenting new options for survey, explorative, scientific and unfortunately military operations.

the-dump 2019-09-26 18:02:54 Inevitably, external companies had been arming their magnetic drones since the very beginning of the technology, but this had been mostly irrelevant. Earth was in its most peaceful period since the dawn of human history. 

Until now.

the-dump 2019-09-26 18:03:05 September, late 2060. Militaries around the world know the potential of the craft in warfare, and by now they are commonplace in armies. Cheap scouting drones, dogfighting craft, transport ships, huge black bombers looming menacingly over objects in proximity. Even a few massive flying carriers rested with some militaries. Some odd weapons too, like mobile artillery cannons and kamikaze drones.

the-dump 2019-09-26 18:03:17 None of this really helped the pacifists when war broke out. There were no long tensions, either. And the cause was quite simple: human error. The code behind one of the autopilot drone systems caused it to switch to autonomous after not receiving any signals for a length of time. Turns out it's quite a bad idea to have this installed on a UN heavy bomber that was routed, for some reason, over a major Asian city while away on a training exercise. The  automatic targeting system, which was usually extremely reliable, started firing bombs at a false positive. At this point, I'm going to remind you the massive destructive potential the bombers possessed. They could carry a huge amount of high-explosive bombs, totalling to damage equivalent to about half the Hiroshima blast. A total of about 30,000 casualties was estimated, and the bomber didn't even drop its full arsenal. Asia, not knowing it had been a malfunction took it as a declaration of war and refused negotiations from the UN.

the-dump 2019-09-26 18:25:59 main problem with climate change is dirty industrial practice and shipping, people keep telling you to 'walk to school' n shit but to be honest it's not going to make a huge difference even if everyone does it. it's the industries that need to improve

help 2019-09-29 12:09:05 so you apply force on the other end
help 2019-09-29 12:09:11 O---------O
help 2019-09-29 12:09:36 what's going to happen is the stick will be pushed to one side because you are essentially pushing in the *same direction* on both ends

help 2019-10-05 21:32:49 however it would be horrible to code on the mess plane crazy is
help 2019-10-05 21:35:55 because plane crazy code is HORRIBLE to work with
help 2019-10-05 21:36:01 i know because i have the source code
help 2019-10-05 21:36:15 it's coded in such a way that one change won't reflect elsewhere
help 2019-10-05 21:36:24 so if you changed building plot size for instance
help 2019-10-05 21:36:42 the placing script would still only allow you to place within the bounds we have now
help 2019-10-05 21:36:54 and if we changed the placing script variables
help 2019-10-05 21:37:17 the flight script wouldn't actually assemble it properly, it would only take from the previous boundaries
help 2019-10-05 21:37:30 well in theory it's possible but it would be really hard
help 2019-10-05 21:37:38 and there would be a lot of bugs
help 2019-10-05 21:37:50 a what?
help 2019-10-05 21:37:53 wdym
help 2019-10-05 21:38:32 what
help 2019-10-05 21:39:09 it's a LOT more complicated than that dude
help 2019-10-05 21:40:20 when you place a block, it's just anchored using the roblox anchor system(it doesn't move) and then, when you press the flight button, a massive complicated 200+ line block of code is run to weld all the surfaces, figure out the aerodynamics, calibrate control surfaces, activate bindings, etc

help 2019-10-05 21:42:39 ;-;
help 2019-10-05 21:43:58 so BYM tools in plane crazy
help 2019-10-05 21:45:02 i get what you mean now
help 2019-10-05 21:45:06 basically, not possible at all
help 2019-10-05 21:45:38 the problem is that plane crazy uses some VERY specific hardcoded scripts and variables that all work together to run the game
help 2019-10-05 21:45:51 introducing this would upset a lot of those variables and clash with the scripts
help 2019-10-05 21:46:44 believe me when I say this, the code is horribly complicated and a massive pain to work with... importing assets from somewhere else is almost always going to break it in incredibly painful to fix ways
help 2019-10-05 21:47:56 it took me a full 3 hours to figure out how to add a slider to a part, lol
help 2019-10-05 21:48:07 we need an aegis-style map imo

help 2019-10-05 21:48:27 yeah
help 2019-10-05 21:49:35 you can just put a new model into the 'blocks' category list if you want, but it might break the building in many instances
help 2019-10-05 21:49:44 take the 1x7 beam as an example
help 2019-10-05 21:49:55 it gets worse though
creations-chat 2019-10-05 22:17:42 low effort = easy to build
creations-chat 2019-10-05 22:18:36 if you spend 3 mins on something people consider funny and upload it and get 40 upvotes or smth it's just completely unfair to  the serious creations that took *days* to build and got just shy of 30

the-dump 2019-10-09 15:49:39 To make tea ingots, we take tea compound and add certain blasting catalysts and compounds - most dominantly Rickium which is an excellent heat moderator, and helps to retain the oxygen and minimise heat loss. Motorium is also added in fairly large quantities to catalyse oxygen reaction and substrate separation. After a calculated period of time, the Rickium will have burned/melted away(any leftover is re-crystallized for future use) exposing the purified tea compound. We drastically reduce the blast pressure, allowing the tea compound to spread out and cut the heat input to prevent boiling off. The tea compound then melts over a period of time and is collected in a casting channel which is made of Rickium and is kept at just above tea compound's melting point to minimise heat loss. Eventually, when melting has finished the blasting process is started over, while the molten tea compound is directed into a specialised casting building where it is blasted with cryogenic heat absorbers to rapidly cool it into tea ingots. The ingots are then transported by overhead crane to an on-site rolling mill to be rolled into extremely thin plates. The plates are then put through a wire drawer and spooled onto cylinders before being loaded onto a waiting train and transported to a client.

If you don't have to make your own, you might be better off using a teabag that is already filtered. (The green tea bags we use are already purified in the filter.) Make it by removing the loose tea leaves and taking out the water. You may also want to wash your hands before preparing your tea bag.

2) Grind and store your tea leaves—If you have a tea pot, place the leaves in the bottom of the pot as the water comes from the tap. Let it steep about 30 minutes or longer until the leaves are about half an inch long.

3) Filter, then brew—Before you use your tea as an infusion, put it in the filter. In the process, you won't be able to drink your tea right away. Add water to the filter, place it in your tea pot

Rick-Jek Jeans: How to Cook

Here are some tips, tips, and suggestions on how to turn these rick-jive pants into some real great-tasting comfort food.

Tip #1: Cook the Tenderloin

I use tongs.

I have a pretty decent, thick skillet (I have a cast iron skillet). So if you are not a good cook, you're better off using a thin metal ladle or an egg yolk pan with a wide opening.

To boil in small batches:

Add the garlic and onion to the skillet, along with the broth from the beans. Give it a whirl and cook over high heat until it starts to simmer.

Now take the pan off the heat and stir in the butter and corn starch. Set the meat

the-dump 2019-10-09 16:39:07 how to develop plane crazy

A new app, built by Australian inventor Mark Wiesner, offers pilots a better understanding of the plane's controls, allowing them to keep control in difficult situations.

The plane uses a series of gyroscopes to steer.

The app uses your accelerometer and accelerometer on mobile phones and other devices to learn and adapt control surfaces.

The app uses the device sensors to determine the location of the plane's flight controls and, once it can identify the correct control surface, adjust the settings to keep the plane in the desired position.

When used by a driver, it can warn them of the current position of the plane's controls.

"By using these accelerometers to help the pilot, we can enable them to operate the aircraft without the pilot actually having to do it himself," Wiesner told ABC News.

"It's an exciting time to be an air pilot. You have an incredibly responsive system," Wiesner said.

As far as the flight controls are concerned, pilots have a lot of flexibility,

Here's what happened: RickJ, like many of his fans, has been following the events of the Rick and Morty Comic Con over the last week or so. After watching the video of Scott and Jeff talking about their Rick and Morty comics (see above), he started wondering if a Rick and Morty convention might be headed his way.

His hopes were shattered when he received an email from Jeff in which he told a story about Rick being in a comic book convention and asking someone the first question: "When are you going to do this again? Do me a favor, I want to see you next year!" But the joke of the comic was on him, as Rick (with his trademark look of "fuck") is not only not attending Comic Con (that's happening next year) but they aren't even scheduled to appear on the

But even with his reputation of a dickhead-slash-bully over the years, he still managed to keep his distance from the car scene, according to friends, as well as those he worked with in the field. "It was something he was not very comfortable doing," the former manager said. "Even that old girl that he was with, when I had her at his place, we were working to buy a van and he would always say, 'Don't spend too much on a van,' so I wasn't worried about it too much."

When he left, though, it seemed that even being surrounded by so many people whose opinion he could be swayed by was taking some of the man's power away from him. He was always very private even when he was in a good mood. "He was always very shy with people," the manager told me. "Even if he was having the time of his life, he didn't really show it off, to me." Still, though, this was a man who

"They're fucking broken beyond repair." One of Jorgeson's friends explained as well, pointing out the lack of power, power cords, etc., that we'd gotten rid of. "We just threw the fuckers out," said Nalani to me later—so it was in any case that I was at the base camp once more.

The base camp was a concrete concrete mess—a veritable field of broken machinery, smashed metal, busted cables, and broken glass littered the ground. In one corner of the camp, there was a small metal shed. It was there that I spent half an hour, with Nalani, taking apart four different types of radio to determine which radio was the transmitter—they all appeared to be brand new and were in perfect working order. The unit they were using as their primary, a C-137, appeared to work fine. "That is a new one, the '85

"This way we can build larger and higher-performance parts in advance."The final step is to build a small mock-up machine to help define the entire platform—a full-sized robot—so that we can plan and design an entire prototype in advance, and then make the parts to scale down at the factory. "For example, if a part needs to be modified, we design an exact replica and start making small modifications," says rick."We start by making an exact copy of the part, but add the modifications you need."The team also makes prototypes using high-precision CAD systems to show their designs and get feedback from others. But with this first product, it was hard to gauge how much feedback they got—there were just so many small features and details they needed to get right. But they are learning. In September the designers moved in to make the final product, and are now testing it in the real world, making adjustments to it based on how the product performs during development or on how the user expects it to be used.The prototype

Police said the gunman entered the McDonalds about 3.30pm and started shooting, killing the 44-year-old and injuring two others.


"There were four people inside (the restaurant)," Cairns Police Superintendent Terry O'Neill said.

''We had to break-up that small group and deal with the individual. He was armed with a rifle.

''So we had four people we did have to engage with at that critical point.''

About two dozen police arrived on the scene and took several people into custody.

A police officer at the scene shot two of the men, O'Neill said. The man who was shot was taken to a nearby hospital but later died.

The man who received the fatal gunshot also suffered leg injuries, including internal bleeding, O

drangchang: It's an awesome story.
The story itself is a good idea in many ways to have an example of an evil person killing another evil person. However, the story itself is rather dull, and does not offer interesting character development for any of the characters. I would like to see an even more well-written story and development from the main characters. The book has many ideas and is rather well-paced. This book has plenty of action in it, yet there are no interesting characters in it.
goddessluvie: Well, I don't know how true that is! The action is exciting and it's enjoyable to watch as well, but I could totally see just doing a scene with three characters and a quick fight, I know my story.
rickje: And then you do them fight again. And then you do a fight again. The action can really go at any time, but I've not seen the point of it! You are either fighting (or fighting back) someone, or you aren't

the-dump 2019-10-09 18:58:05 Rickje139, our lead developer, now has an important notice to give about motors. Over to you, rick.

Rickje139: I am a member of the R&D team and working with the motor team to help design better motors that will be faster and will be more reliable when running. This is a project that will take time. But over time, I believe we will find the best solution that is cost effective for this project.

I think many people have asked whether we're using an F3 motor design, that is essentially a single chain link. Well, we are using an F2-type motor and this is a new version of our motors and the new motors will be faster and a more stable and stable compared to the original F3 motors we were using.

So that's the new, faster, smoother motors for us.

I believe people will be very excited about these motor and if they buy one soon I believe they will be very happy because of this high quality performance, and I will be sure to inform you guys on the progress.

*madattak walks onto stage*

madattak: Hey everyone. At this year's annual conference, we will be giving our readers an insight into what we did between last year and now. We are very excited to be able to release this year's car as well; something we've been working on for some time.

*advertisements sound*

Madattak: Today, we're going to show you a video which represents our progress during this year's development. One of the biggest changes was the reworking of the engine and drivetrain. We now have the ability to control both torque, fuel consumption and engine noise. This allows us to give the car everything we want while providing what's required of a Formula 5 car while making it easy to set up for any individual.

The engine is a brand new four-cylinder engine featuring aluminum and titanium pistons

 And Rickje said, “Let there be motor,” and there was motor.  Rickje saw that the motor was good, and he separated the motor from the bugs.  Rickje called the motor “day,” and the bugs he called “night.” And there was evening, and there was morning—the first day.

 And Rickje said, “Let there be a vault between the tutorial planes to separate tutorial plane from tutorial plane.”  So Rickje made the vault and separated the tutorial plane under the vault from the tutorial plane above it. And it was so.  Rickje called the vault “sky.” And there was evening, and there was morning—the second day.

 And Rickje said, “Let the tutorial plane under the sky be gathered to one place, and let dry ground appear.” And it was so.  Rickje called the dry ground “land,” and the gathered tutorial planes he called “seas.” And Rickje saw that it was good.

the-dump 2019-10-11 21:05:47 Then Rickje said, “Let the land produce vegetation: seed-bearing plants and trees on the land that bear fruit with seed in it, according to their various kinds.” And it was so.  The land produced vegetation: plants bearing seed according to their kinds and trees bearing fruit with seed in it according to their kinds. And Rickje saw that it was good.  And there was evening, and there was morning—the third day.

 And Rickje said, “Let there be motors in the vault of the sky to separate the day from the night, and let them serve as signs to mark sacred times, and days and years,  and let them be motors in the vault of the sky to give motor on the terrain.” And it was so.  Rickje made two great motors—the greater motor to govern the day and the lesser motor to govern the night. He also made the stars.  Rickje set them in the vault of the sky to give motor on the terrain,  to govern the day and the night, and to separate motor from bugs. And Rickje saw that it was good.  And there was evening, and there was morning—the fourth day.
_ _
the-dump 2019-10-11 21:05:55 And Rickje said, “Let the tutorial plane teem with living creatures, and let wedge fly above the terrain across the vault of the sky.”  So Rickje created the great creatures of the sea and every living thing with which the tutorial plane teems and that moves about in it, according to their kinds, and every winged bird according to its kind. And Rickje saw that it was good.  Rickje blessed them and said, “Be fruitful and increase in number and fill the tutorial plane in the seas, and let the wedge increase on the terrain.”  And there was evening, and there was morning—the fifth day.

 And Rickje said, “Let the land produce living creatures according to their kinds: the engine, the creatures that move along the ground, and the wings, each according to its kind.” And it was so.  Rickje made the wings according to their kinds, the engine according to their kinds, and all the creatures that move along the ground according to their kinds. And Rickje saw that it was good.

 Then Rickje said, “Let us make madattakind in our image, in our likeness, so that they may rule over the block in the sea and the wedge in the sky, over the engine and all the wings,[a] and over all the creatures that move along the ground.”

 So Rickje created madattakind in his own image,
    in the image of Rickje he created them;
    male and female he created them.
_ _
the-dump 2019-10-11 21:06:01 Rickje blessed them and said to them, “Be fruitful and increase in number; fill the terrain and subdue it. Rule over the block in the sea and the wedge in the sky and over every living creature that moves on the ground.”

 Then Rickje said, “I give you every seed-bearing plant on the face of the whole terrain and every tree that has fruit with seed in it. They will be yours for food.  And to all the beasts of the terrain and all the wedge in the sky and all the creatures that move along the ground—everything that has the breath of life in it—I give every green plant for food.” And it was so.

 Rickje saw all that he had made, and it was very good. And there was evening, and there was morning—the sixth day.

As part of our new #Tea4all scheme, we have developed a low-capacity short range helicopter to assist in delivering tea to rural and inaccessible areas. It will see action as soon as production is finished in early 2020. 

Side notes:
- 4 blocks wide, so I had to use a piston to adjust the main rotor
- Took around 2 hours
- Basically my first helicopter
- Coaxial
- Very stable in flight
- Adjustable landing skids(motor mounted)

creations-chat 2019-10-24 16:48:21 the aerodynamics were coded in by madattak
creations-chat 2019-10-24 16:48:32 and they're probably some of the best dynamic aerodynamics on roblox
creations-chat 2019-10-24 16:49:08 flight simulators all use static aerodynamics where all the planes run using the same simple variables

the-dump 2019-10-26 20:20:20 why
creations-chat 2019-10-26 21:29:48 it's pretty neat
creations-chat 2019-10-26 21:30:08 it's a nice mechanism
creations-chat 2019-10-26 21:30:23 i was trying to make a swashplate earlier and just gave up, it was acting really weird
creations-chat 2019-10-26 21:30:58 it's small, not much detail on it either
creations-chat 2019-10-26 21:31:37 making a swashplate is about 50x harder than making a chinook cockpit
creations-chat 2019-10-26 21:31:42 -.-
creations-chat 2019-10-26 21:33:19 i was IMPLYING something, i wasn't trying to say that you said that .-.
creations-chat 2019-10-26 21:34:26 this is what my 3rd swashplate attempt ended me up with
creations-chat 2019-10-26 21:34:28 lmao
creations-chat 2019-10-26 21:34:31 ah crap <#384025409945337856>
creations-chat 2019-10-26 21:34:39 BRUH
creations-chat 2019-10-26 21:34:44 it's not meant to look good
creations-chat 2019-10-26 21:34:46 it's meant to work
creations-chat 2019-10-26 21:34:53 but it didn't even achieve that... not well anyways
creations-chat 2019-10-26 21:35:06 it was my 3rd attempt. i'm not flexing it, jesus christ
creations-chat 2019-10-26 21:35:22 it was an experiment
creations-chat 2019-10-26 21:37:08 why
creations-chat 2019-10-26 21:37:12 ???
creations-chat 2019-10-26 21:37:20 have you ever tried making a swashplate?
creations-chat 2019-10-26 21:37:27 did you succeed?
creations-chat 2019-10-26 21:37:34 ok show me then
creations-chat 2019-10-26 21:37:49 fine, i'll take your word for it
creations-chat 2019-10-26 21:37:58 ok well
creations-chat 2019-10-26 21:38:04 i guess we should stop making planes!
creations-chat 2019-10-26 21:38:08 and VTOLS!
creations-chat 2019-10-26 21:38:10 and ships!
creations-chat 2019-10-26 21:38:17 they aren't original!
creations-chat 2019-10-26 21:38:51 the point isn't to build a new mechanism no one's seen before. you don't have to do that every time you log onto plane crazy.
creations-chat 2019-10-26 21:38:56 just let people do what they want
creations-chat 2019-10-26 21:39:00 ok?
creations-chat 2019-10-26 21:39:06 no
creations-chat 2019-10-26 21:39:09 it isn't
creations-chat 2019-10-26 21:39:22 uh
creations-chat 2019-10-26 21:39:29 no not really
creations-chat 2019-10-26 21:39:59 i want to build a swashplate because A) they're interesting to build B) they enable far more interesting helicopter flight
creations-chat 2019-10-26 21:40:21 i don't really care about flexing. maybe you do, but that's YOUR point of view. so don't assume it's everyones.

creations-chat 2019-10-27 17:40:54 you know what he meant. colour scheme or whatever ;-;
creations-chat 2019-10-27 17:41:01 there's no need to get into this
creations-chat 2019-10-27 17:41:07 it's pointless.
creations-chat 2019-10-27 17:41:13 why does it matter so much?
creations-chat 2019-10-27 17:41:30 BRUH
creations-chat 2019-10-27 17:42:16 🤦 he essentially said that he doesn't like the colour scheme. it doesn't matter with what wording, you don't need to get into this over it
the-dump 2019-10-27 17:42:46 mindflayer?
the-dump 2019-10-27 17:42:57 i would like to mention he has an expert rank
the-dump 2019-10-27 17:43:10 and you do not. stop trying to criticise him by posting year-old builds -.-
the-dump 2019-10-27 17:43:42 holy FUCK why are people unable to take constructive criticism any more?
the-dump 2019-10-27 17:43:58 I get some people use it to just insult people, but in this case he WASN'T.
the-dump 2019-10-27 17:44:09 please stop, this whole thing is stupid.
help 2019-10-27 17:47:08 replace wings with control surfaces. also keep in mind that control surfaces further out to the sides of the plane will have a greater effect than those closer... and control panels will help pitch more if they are further toward the back or front
help 2019-10-27 17:47:13 or just use keyboard controls

creations-chat 2019-10-27 19:56:30 ..
creations-chat 2019-10-27 19:56:47 can't we just appreciate the actual rocket
creations-chat 2019-10-27 20:03:18 the thing i don't get
creations-chat 2019-10-27 20:03:36 is why you guys care about banning unde's so much, especially if they build well
creations-chat 2019-10-27 20:04:08 it's hardly like discord hires undercover agents to go in the hundreds of thousands of large discord servers to find out which ones don't ban <13's
creations-chat 2019-10-27 20:04:44 no, that wasn't the point
creations-chat 2019-10-27 20:05:01 the point was that you're so desperate to find them all lol
creations-chat 2019-10-27 20:05:37 i wasn't talking about you specifically
creations-chat 2019-10-27 20:06:30 the first thing i saw was the stupid creeper
creations-chat 2019-10-27 20:06:50 can i have a rant?
creations-chat 2019-10-27 20:08:31 i hate how people post builds and get huge amounts of upvotes just because the builds reference some sort of popular culture(eg: minecraft). these builds are never judged on how they LOOK unless they look absolutely terrible. it's particularly bad with minecraft because you can basically just copy a block, pixel to fucking pixel, and get loads of upvotes
creations-chat 2019-10-27 20:08:50 and don't get me started
creations-chat 2019-10-27 20:08:52 on meme builds
creations-chat 2019-10-27 20:09:31 yah they look nice
creations-chat 2019-10-27 20:09:46 might be able to use a bit more colour variation and contrast though
creations-chat 2019-10-27 20:09:53 imo
creations-chat 2019-10-27 20:10:36 i suggest at least different shades of gray
creations-chat 2019-10-27 20:10:59 since it's hard to emphasise on the detail with just 1-3 similar shades
creations-chat 2019-10-27 20:11:47 the plot was blue and we very rarely get other people's creations posted here
creations-chat 2019-10-27 20:11:56 there just isn't much point, it looks better cropped anyways
creations-chat 2019-10-27 20:34:54 don't post unfinished creations here please
creations-chat 2019-10-27 20:35:10 rather <#478584971670454284> if you want advice and <#384021699466756107> to flex

The world is falling apart
the-dump 2019-10-27 22:17:29 So it was with the world

that Rickje fought

and he fell, he went through

his heart and he felt

the heart of every single living thing

He cried as he saw them lose

Rickje knew this was it

All the worlds went

the world would go under

Rickje watched it go

and he knew it was over
the-dump 2019-10-27 22:18:03 Rickje is the last one

He says "I think you should flee"

He makes a run for it

I think I think it's pretty scary now

creations-chat 2019-11-03 14:59:06 Welcome to the IDRACORE™ reactor. This smaller-than-average reactor supplies power to the nearby motor research lab(owned by FINKL™). The project took 6 years in total to plan and build, and now runs 24/7, supplying excess power to nearby towns. 

Information about the inner workings of this reactor are classified, but we assure you having the turbines and the reactor in the same room is perfectly safe in this case.

1) not enough creations are posted here to 'flood the channel' and smother other images to any bad extent
2) people like to show you DIFFERENT ANGLES. A build often looks very different from other angles
3) people sometimes spend a LOT of time on the creations posted here and don't want to let all that effort go to waste
4) just because your tripod can be shown with 1 angle doesn't mean every creation can

creations-chat 2020-06-07 23:43:39 Bruh
creations-chat 2020-06-07 23:44:14 That's just the concept. You can't say that a 737 is a tutorial plane because someone made a tutorial for a 737
creations-chat 2020-06-07 23:44:36 And yea it's blocky but imo in a good way
creations-chat 2020-06-07 23:44:48 After all smooth builds do get a bit boring
creations-chat 2020-06-07 23:47:22 Absolutely, textured builds are the best
creations-chat 2020-06-07 23:47:54 One of the reasons I dislike passenger jets
creations-chat 2020-06-07 23:48:37 Yup
creations-chat 2020-06-07 23:51:33 Well, yeah. How'd you do it though? When I designed them I was considering adding roles for stuff like building robots that use a certain mechanism but the issue was there'd be tons of debate around whether certain builds counted or not. The designer ranks are kinda the main compromise for that
creations-chat 2020-06-07 23:56:07 Oh, also that was the thinking behind needing upvotes for expert ranks. Can't reach the top without peopls liking your stuff

help 2020-06-09 22:42:10 <@!592756480118358016> centre the landing gears that are most toward the back on the centre of mass/lift. basically it lets the plane 'rotate' around that point like a pivot if you see what I mean
help 2020-06-09 22:42:43 and make sure they're tall enough so the tail doesn't strike the ground in a way that prevents you taking off
help 2020-06-09 22:44:01 and ye as RBK said your tail surfaces are on backwards

creations-chat 2020-06-11 17:46:17 i think you overestimate how hard it is to get started in this game especially if you haven't played anything like it before or don't have understanding of aerodynamics

creations-chat 2020-06-11 17:54:46 rick would expand the building space, people have asked before, but the game is, again, hardcoded
creations-chat 2020-06-11 17:55:42 the problem is that people enjoy just shitting on other people and not providing any meaningful feedback
creations-chat 2020-06-11 17:56:37 i used to play bym/byd but there's just a certain charm to plane crazy
creations-chat 2020-06-11 17:58:11 no aerodynamics though, and more boring map
creations-chat 2020-06-11 17:58:15 no
creations-chat 2020-06-11 17:58:47 secret is always in the detailing, find a way to incorporate texture and interesting patterns into otherwise flat surfaces
creations-chat 2020-06-11 17:59:17 simple VTOL's are good for getting a feel on the aerodynamics

bug-reports 2020-06-17 20:25:11 no, don't worry about it, plenty of people are reporting the problem. I just wanted to get some F9 logs to show the developer
bug-reports 2020-06-17 20:29:41 there's been a lot of debate about that, there's just one developer so progress isn't fast, a couple of maps have been proposed but none implemented. plot size would be increased but the game is hardcoded, which means that it's extremely hard to do
bug-reports 2020-06-17 20:31:22 a lot of people have a lot of suggestions, but the way the game is scripted makes it almost impossible to do a lot of them

creations-chat 2020-07-13 22:50:22 it gets tough with staging though

creations-chat 2020-07-13 22:54:50 yeah. but keep in mind that when you separate stages, centre of mass is going to shift
creations-chat 2020-07-13 22:55:24 so centre of lift also needs to shift
creations-chat 2020-07-13 22:57:17 this is a really awful drawing, but with no stages separated the centre of mass (green dot) and lift (black dot) are going to be in the same place, right?
creations-chat 2020-07-13 22:57:57 but if the second stage were on its own -
creations-chat 2020-07-13 22:58:02 they wouldn't be in line
creations-chat 2020-07-13 22:59:04 just think in terms of stages instead of the whole rocket. try to balance each stage individually (line centre of mass up with lift)
creations-chat 2020-07-13 22:59:22 um, not sure, I think so
creations-chat 2020-07-13 22:59:23 lemme check
creations-chat 2020-07-13 23:00:15 yes, they do count

bug-reports 2020-08-09 23:25:23 lighting is a massive fucking problem with roblox
bug-reports 2020-08-09 23:25:33 i tried to implement a lighting system for a friend last week
bug-reports 2020-08-09 23:25:51 the lights gradually switched off over 10 seconds or so using a sin wave
bug-reports 2020-08-09 23:26:21 and there were 2 second gaps between each update despite the brightness changing over 1000 or so iterations (i tried different numbers and wait times for this)
bug-reports 2020-08-09 23:26:46 it was just a straight plunge from mediocre lighting into darkness at the last step
bug-reports 2020-08-09 23:27:38 couldn't find any solution. i think you would need to implement your own system to get past this, unless I'm missing something seriously obvious so I think lights are going to stay broken
bug-reports 2020-08-09 23:27:47 the updates are just way too slow sometimes
