help 2022-11-12 06:23:32 Or motor lock fold
help 2022-11-12 21:15:11 I don’t think it would ever fit
help 2022-11-12 21:15:42 Unless you make a way to compact the folding or just make the build smaller
help 2022-11-12 21:16:52 Or maybe there’s some room on the side you can try and fold from the side
help 2022-11-20 17:43:42 You have to reset it to it according angle
help 2022-11-20 17:44:14 Just place blocks and color them diff colors to know what angle it is each time
help 2022-11-24 07:49:11 I think it is because some servers have a bug to delete one kind of block

help 2022-11-25 05:57:57 Like to limit the angle
help 2022-11-25 05:58:12 And so you can hold it until it stops resetting
help 2022-11-25 16:03:37 Try angle locking to add a curve to not make it so flat or do piston lock to add glass with a outline of trails or wing panels
help 2022-12-03 23:51:28 No
help 2022-12-03 23:52:03 Just find a way to balance it using wings or ballast and helium
help 2022-12-03 23:53:05 Then put a ballast block on the end
