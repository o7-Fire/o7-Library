creations-chat 2021-04-18 17:53:30 going toxic where
creations-chat 2021-04-18 18:09:58 it looks like a plain square. try separating the tracks from the body itself a bit and try adding a bit more detail to make it look like its "rough"

wheels also look kinda weird, maybe use a different type of wheel like the cylinder 2 2x2
creations-chat 2021-04-18 18:12:50 maybe try adding custom suspension like a bunch of tanks have, and yes, over all the body needs more work because it looks like a smooth piece of butter
