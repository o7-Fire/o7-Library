creations-chat 2020-12-10 00:42:35 Is it better with or without the cone?

creations-chat 2020-12-10 21:28:18 I made a second Jet engine, this time my goal was to make it so the fan would actually spin and actually create a lot of power. I thought it would be easy, fun even. Jesus christ was I wrong. But I've done it. A Jet engine big enough for an A380, smooth body, realistic interior with combustion chamber being where most of the air goes to, and the rest to cool the engine, and a freaking spinning fan. Oh and it's much better than the first one. More accurately scaled to modern jet engines on airliners, a spinning fan, more compact, and a more realistic mechanical structure on the inside. Sorry for the paragraph but my god I need people to know the hell that moving stuff and motor lock combined is. Please @ me if you have any advice, DM me if you want to use it for your build. I'll show build mode when the Slowmode timer goes down.
creations-chat 2020-12-10 21:32:16 First one on the Right, New one on the Left. The new one took all of yesterday and today btw. Feel free to screenshot this photo if u wanna use it for something.

creations-chat 2020-12-10 21:39:48 Skrew it, I hate myself enough. Should I make another but with a accurate afterburner and reverse thrust function?
creations-chat 2020-12-10 21:44:13 aight
creations-chat 2020-12-10 22:17:53 I can't think of a way to make this kind of back move inwards and outwards while being motor locked with a bunch of copies of itself at different angles. Suggestions?

creations-chat 2020-12-10 22:37:58 <@!451853936815636511> Wooooosh.
creations-chat 2020-12-10 22:43:13 You say this, when nobody else asked, and went along with it. So clearly it is funny enough for people not to react negatively to it.
creations-chat 2020-12-11 00:31:45 Afterburners are ligit impossible, I can't find a way to make a f-18 afterburner. No matter what I do. Flat out impossible.
creations-chat 2020-12-11 01:48:13 <@!618160304974725133> Trails don't work either, even if you spring lock them super close together, they only go outwards. The only way I see it beign possible is with half triangle wedges, which would need so much motor lock it would take up the entire plot.
creations-chat 2020-12-11 03:15:16 <@!720891502108344360> He posted nothing, saying he built air. and someone reported it.

creations-chat 2020-12-11 03:20:43 Ikr. Someone just said "do the do" to an admin and the person who posted air got build blacklisted and warned.
creations-chat 2020-12-14 19:25:41 So on my quest to make perfect engine designs for every modern day jet, (Airliner, fighter, or otherwise) I'm starting with the F/A-18 Super Hornet for the fighter engines. But looking at the blueprints and photos, I can't tell what would be more accurate for the intake. Two 1x1 wedges, or one 1x2 wedge?
creations-chat 2020-12-16 18:52:26 I am close to giving up on making this adjustable afterburner nozzle. I've ligit tried everything and nothing works right. literally any ideas at all? It's a F-18 Engine, I just have the intake done.
creations-chat 2020-12-16 20:55:38 <@!300749802009001986> Put it inside of the engine

creations-chat 2020-12-20 22:34:42 I'd say add two more sparklers and a gun to the barrel, and yes, a different paintjob.
creations-chat 2020-12-20 22:57:01 Use more of a green color for the top.
creations-chat 2020-12-22 08:23:58 Yey it's my birthday
creations-chat 2021-03-02 21:56:58 I felt like doing something mini, and since I already had experience making 13 different types of mini vehicles now, it would be a quick, fun, and easy build.
creations-chat 2021-03-02 22:28:00 The elevators are too far back, they aren't elevated higher on the body than the main wings, the tails aren't angled enough, the afterburners are too far back, the cockpit is too tall, the tails are too short, the hardpoints on the wings are the same width as the external fuel tank, the steep slope on the nose makes the nose look more like the awkward cousin of the A-10 warthog, Intakes are non-existant, *un-custom landing gear*, main wings are too far back, the entire plane is too long, *uneven exposed motor lock* like if there's exposed motor lock at least make it even, the angle of the elevators is too shallow, the mid-air refueling port is permanetly open, nose looks out of scale with the rest of the f-18 The ailerons look completely out fo scale, no rudders, no carrier hook, no framing on the cockpit windsheild, none of the f/a-18's cannons are there, the curved delta wing extending from the cockpit is too steep and lasts too long, you're flying from the rear seat, the wings don't fold up enough, The entire plane isn't to scale, and with more angles I could find more.

Actual feedback that isn't tiny little nit-picks is that the elevators are too far back, the tails are too short and aren't angled enough, the plane body is too long, and the nose looks like an a-10 warthog. the main wings are too far back and the afterburners are also too far back

creations-chat 2021-05-28 00:14:43 Hey, does anybody have any ideas on how to make the exits and entrances from the Ontario Freeway to Beach Ave. in micro scale? Asking for a friend who happens to be making all of the roads and major cities of California and also happens to be me.
creations-chat 2021-05-28 04:33:32 How does first section of micro scale city look? It's a snowy entrance and exit to a freeway based off of the Ontario 15.
creations-chat 2021-05-28 04:48:50 No one gave me feedback..
creations-chat 2021-05-28 05:06:33 Are these markings too close together?

creations-chat 2021-05-28 05:26:41 All of this just for that small square of details
creations-chat 2021-05-28 05:28:44 A city in California called Rancho Cucamonga, This is the freeway exit and entrance from the Ontario 15 freeway to Beach Ave. I'm basically taking all the cities of California and making them in micro scale and I'm starting where I used to live.

creations-chat 2021-06-02 01:36:04 The f-14 maybe? Known even today as one of the best and revolutionary fighters?
creations-chat 2021-06-05 19:15:00 Just finished F-14 and F-15, and I kinda wanna make a overrated Lockheed stealth fighter. Which do I make, F-22, F-35A, F-35B, or F-35C?
creations-chat 2021-07-07 10:53:02 I purposefully didn't add skin because uhh, I don't know where skin would go on a jet? but if you wanna provide RBGs then I'll try and add skin.
creations-chat 2021-07-07 10:55:24 wait if I do that will I get banned for nswf? TRust me, I tried f-14. a f-14 skirt would've been great but it doesn't work
creations-chat 2021-07-07 11:03:30 Happy? Alright fine, you guys pick a plane that has small wings in the front and big wings in the back that would work better for the maid outfit. Although I could always just make a f-14 with the main wings in the back.
creations-chat 2021-07-07 11:56:18 <@!712273624865701921> the motorlock would still show on the bottom tho.
creations-chat 2021-07-07 11:59:14 What method is that? yes, that's what I was thinking
creations-chat 2021-07-07 12:07:12 bruh how are they so similar. I didn't even know anyone else who's made a j-20, let alone a maid j-20 so I wanted to make one. damn

creations-chat 2021-09-07 15:49:33 Uhhhh I'm bored, what do I build? Which model tho?
creations-chat 2021-09-07 15:52:46 E that would be cool, but a semi-aquatic car actually sounds pretty cool. What model should I build tho?
creations-chat 2021-09-07 15:55:31 It doesn't seem like a car but sure, and I also don't think a plane is a car either. I'll just have to make a car some other time, also has anyone else made a terrapin before?
creations-chat 2021-09-07 15:59:22 Also the blueprints I'm using give me the exact measurements in feet, should I go through the trouble to make this to scale?
creations-chat 2021-09-07 16:09:58 I know but I'm already determined to make a Terrapin since no one else has yet. But I'll finish it within like an hour and a half so thanks for another idea to build.

creations-chat 2021-09-07 18:36:57 Thank you
creations-chat 2021-09-07 18:43:08 So for the retractable canopy I thought 'Oh it'll be easy I'll just use ropes!' Well today I just learned the actual rope part of a rope has no collision. Any other ideas?
creations-chat 2021-09-07 19:50:33 Inside of Terrapin is done and painting is all that's left, thoughts?
creations-chat 2021-09-07 19:55:59 Hand me some.
creations-chat 2021-09-07 22:01:28 **It's something that everyone already knew how to do** and there are even tutorials that use it in their builds.
creations-chat 2021-10-02 08:52:08 I wanted to make double-lever suspension like on the bottom of the sherman's tracks, but I also wanted to do motor 2 suspension and so I did both. Feedback?
creations-chat 2021-10-02 08:58:21 All of the wheels have motor 2 suspension on them btw
creations-chat 2021-10-02 09:01:44 This is just a concept, Idek what I'm gonna do with it past this point, I don't even know what I COULD do with it past this point. But if I do decide to do something at least the motor lock will be easy to hide

creations-chat 2021-10-06 01:13:38 Thoughts?
creations-chat 2021-10-06 01:16:07 Why? It's gonna be a full Museum Exhibit. I just got lazy here and put a wood sign for now.
creations-chat 2021-10-06 01:22:02 It may look like it for now, but there will soon be a whole fake room around it made to make it look like a museum exhibit. But today I rest.

creations-chat 2021-10-06 01:47:03 I would but I'm 100% sure someone's already done that, and I wanna do something no one else has done before.
creations-chat 2021-10-09 06:38:24 Okay so I'm making a Museum Exhibit Moc. Give me plane-crazy-specific themed ideas to put in the displays
creations-chat 2021-10-09 07:34:12 Part 1 of oddly-gamer-specific Museum exhibit pretty much done. Feedback?
creations-chat 2021-10-09 07:38:36 I tried that but I can't make a good design without it being bigger than the avatar. Waitwaitwait. I should put every block in the game in a display case in order of when they were added. That would be amazing. But I don't remember what month each block was added so unless I find out I couldn't do that lol.
creations-chat 2021-10-09 07:55:31 Right but where would I put that doe I can't put it on the bed unless I put it at a random angle. If I don't do that then it'll look too intentional. And there is not very much room at all for motor locking underneath it
creations-chat 2021-10-09 21:03:44 You have no idea how much more complex this one freaking IdeaPad made this creation.
creations-chat 2021-10-29 04:25:08 Since when do we have to wait for you to ask something in order to say anything?
creations-chat 2021-11-01 23:47:29 Cool tip: Adding onto an argument or hostile conversation, that has nothing to do with you, with mockery isn't very good at improving the mood or situation. <:WhatChamp:775044367022555166> This isn't hypocrisy due to me neither mocking a statement or intentionally bringing along negative intentions. I am simply pointing out a mistake made that shouldn't be repeated so arguments don't prolong themselves past what's necessary.

creations-chat 2021-11-03 21:37:07 Welp looks like I'm making the M2A1 105mm Howitzer since I just got a really good idea on what to do for the barrel but I can't find any good blueprints for the M101
creations-chat 2022-01-12 10:17:18 Random question, what would be the approximate real-world measurements of a plane crazy block? like 1m. x 1m. x 1m. or like 1ft. x 1ft. x 1ft. ?
creations-chat 2022-01-12 10:45:34 Anyone wanna answer this or..?

creations-chat 2022-05-06 02:38:56 Futuristic-ish F-15 EX. Honestly not that special, overrated pelican looking engines and wings, and it's not even painted. But for some reason I wanna hear other opinions so. It is W.I.P.
creations-chat 2022-06-06 08:03:38 W.I.P. T-55 Drop-ship thingy. Tryna be a mix of Sci-Fi and cold War themed. This is just the EARLY prototype for an ejection system and a cool door design. I have no idea how I want this to fly or what design the engines should be so some suggestions would be nice. (There's going to be 6 tanks on different layers later so yeah)
creations-chat 2022-06-06 08:17:24 If you want the 3x3 turret to turn into a 5x5 turret then sure. It's not possible within the scale of the T-55's, which are mini.
creations-chat 2022-06-06 09:23:58 Yes, which space does it occupy?
creations-chat 2023-01-14 23:08:33 I don't wanna post this to creations cuz it's cringe

help 2023-02-12 08:09:36 if fly, is good
creations-chat 2023-02-12 08:14:57 There are control surfaces in the back, and it is launched by basically the same mechanism as tnt ball launchers, just form-fit with grooves for the fins and such. The sparklers are super light making the heaviest part of the whole thing the delta wings. Sorry about the image quality, those two were the best of 15 I took so <:Shrugje139:652564379577090074>
creations-chat 2023-02-12 08:17:53 Yeah you could say that. I'm thinking about making a little hidden hover drive thing that trails far behind it with offset locking, but idk. As it is it can launch from the plots and pass the mountain area so I'm pretty happy with it. I think I'll just work on trying to make it work on the tips of wings on jets. That's also why I put (kinda) when I said it could fly. It's more like being launched than flying but flying sounds better.
creations-chat 2023-02-12 08:23:26 I'd post pictures of the launching mechanism too but uh.. it looks really bad and it's 12 am so I don't feel like making it look good
creations-chat 2023-02-12 08:44:57 I think I found a way to let it have powered flight, but maybe not. You'll know if it works. yes it worked, so basically I selectively blew up part of the snow blaster so only the part with little rings is left and it still makes thrust
creations-chat 2023-02-12 08:47:38 Oh yeah maybe, if I blow off the outer shell of the propellor engine it might not look too bad. Lemme try that instead of the snow blaster. nah I'll do it tomorrow, busy watching gate.
creations-chat 2023-02-12 09:01:42 It's easier to get an alt and just put them on a turret with wheel and 1 gun, that way you can carefully make specific parts disappear. but if you don't have an alt then put an explosive down and keep tweaking the blast radius.
help 2023-02-12 09:05:54 no
creations-chat 2023-02-26 20:55:56 I did a clock gear system <:Thonk:509498568982134816>
creations-chat 2023-02-26 22:14:47 none of those change the tail design tho-
creations-chat 2023-02-26 22:19:05 What is bro saying. You building it has nothing to do with the fact that your tail looks nothing like the tail of any variants period. Bro's actually mad that his huey tail looks bad.
creations-chat 2023-02-26 22:21:45 I don't think nations are built on.. cement.. Maybe sealand but that's not really a nation. Pretty sure they're on these things called continents but yk.
creations-chat 2023-02-26 22:25:50 I did not say that. I said that none of the huey models change the design of the tail of the aircraft. That fact has nothing to do with the fact that you have already made the tail on your wack huey. Taking these roasts literally is not helping the case that your huey tail is bad.
creations-chat 2023-02-26 23:29:42 uh I fogor

I let you know when I get back on my pc

I'mma try to make the other cgi drone tank thingy, lemme find an example of it.
creations-chat 2023-02-26 23:32:52 YES! I found it. This cgi military drone thing. I might need help with the deployable rocket launcher, but I think I have an idea.
creations-chat 2023-02-26 23:43:08 I did make a cessna with a trail fuselage

OH WAIT I REALIZED WHAT YOU MEANT NVM

I thought you mean like- a wire frame fuselage but my god how would you hide the motorlock for a full trail fuselage?
creations-chat 2023-02-26 23:46:43 Bro that f-15 could be hof if you do the rear as good as you did the fuselage cuz that doesn't even look like plane crazy.
creations-chat 2023-02-26 23:48:47 not good, and that poor f-16 got squished :(
creations-chat 2023-02-26 23:55:55 1. How do you explode specific parts of stuff cuz whenever I do it it always ends up terribly.

2. How did you learn to do all of this.

3. How is it gonna be able to fly? It'll be more dense than tungsten.

4. How many hours do you have in plane crazy?
