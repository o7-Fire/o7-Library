bot-central 2020-06-30 12:49:36 &suggest allow us to keybind guns
having to pilot the plane,control the turret and also have a hand on the mouse to click requires more than 2 hands

bot-central 2020-06-30 12:52:26 "mantis" spaceship
bot-central 2020-06-30 12:53:15 unnamed scout plane
bot-central 2020-06-30 12:53:52 mostly finished ship
bot-central 2020-06-30 12:54:18 unnamed transport vtol
bot-central 2020-06-30 12:55:08 spring powered ball launcher
bot-central 2020-06-30 12:55:51 railgun tank
bot-central 2020-06-30 12:56:25 whatever is this abomination
bot-central 2020-06-30 12:57:29 bomber with 4 guided bombs that i finished yesterday
bot-central 2020-06-30 12:59:03 ?
bot-central 2020-06-30 12:59:58 oh
creations-chat 2020-06-30 13:06:22 what do you think of this
it's mostly finished
i still need to do a lot of the right side,do the interior and finish up the bridge
creations-chat 2020-06-30 13:10:52 yeah i may remove it
creations-chat 2020-06-30 13:10:56 for stability
creations-chat 2020-06-30 13:11:14 eh
they are cooler for me
creations-chat 2020-06-30 13:11:25 and i can bomb from high altitude this way
creations-chat 2020-06-30 13:12:26 if i wanted to attack ground targets with rockets i'd make a fighter
bug-reports 2020-06-30 13:12:51 explosive balls often don't do any damage on impact
especially at high speeds
bug-reports 2020-06-30 13:13:13 so launching them at enemies with a gun is pointless
bug-reports 2021-09-11 10:33:49 why do these motors move for literally no reason?

bug-reports 2021-09-11 10:33:54 this game is slowly making me go insane
bug-reports 2021-09-11 10:34:11 i'm not pressing anything
bug-reports 2021-09-11 10:37:00 <:hahaa:773727260539617280>
bug-reports 2021-09-11 10:38:45 then how does one make a proper leg
bug-reports 2021-09-11 10:38:56 all I want is to use that as landing gear
it doesn't even need to move around
bot-central 2021-09-11 11:52:55 who pinged

the-dump 2021-09-11 14:16:53 fuck it im disabling all pings
creations-chat 2021-09-11 14:38:53 dropship using legs instead of landing gear
it'll have a door on the bottom to unload cargo/troops
creations-chat 2021-09-11 14:42:11 imagine building replicas <:trollface:775024642104229898>

creations-chat 2021-09-11 14:52:03 i have this flying wing that i can't be bothered to finish rn
the fps really drops when i fold the wing for some reason
creations-chat 2021-09-11 14:54:19 wdym,the motor turns 90 degrees and then it's attached with magnets
creations-chat 2021-09-11 15:01:18 lmao
