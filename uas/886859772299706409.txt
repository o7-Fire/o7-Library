the-dump 2022-04-22 17:26:52 the dopest thing about horses is that they're basically grass engines
like,grass comes in, fast comes out
most things that produce fast (like cheetahs and cars) use much more heavily processed grass like meat,and oil
and yet here the horses are,producing the fast,using only the grass.
