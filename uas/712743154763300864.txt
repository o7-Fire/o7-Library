creations-chat 2020-08-12 23:17:56 Which paint looks better? top or bottom?
creations-chat 2020-08-12 23:17:58 
creations-chat 2020-09-05 20:28:52 hmm.. looks good to me as well.. wedges at the bottom to curve to the bottom of the hull, glad you got that.. most people just make it regular beams and not wedged down (not that theres anything wrong with doing that, just that the wedges is a nice small detail)
creations-chat 2020-09-05 20:30:41 is it going to be a three fold ship right? is it based off a real ship, or just made up?
creations-chat 2020-09-05 20:31:55 ahh gotcha. well, basically, look at it like this: either you could have most of its firepower at the back, front, or even throughout the ship.
creations-chat 2020-09-05 20:33:15 if you want it even, then the superstructure should be around in the middle, but if you want most of it to be at the front, which could make it hard hitting, but more likely to have the main guns disabled in fewer hits, the superstructure would be towards the back
creations-chat 2020-09-05 22:07:00 hm... i feel like a challenge.. anyone got any ideas on what i should make next, then see how fast and good i can make it?
creations-chat 2020-09-05 22:47:19 ya know those moments when you need to go to the airport to fly somewhere, but there isnt a single plane there, only a very small tank? i think that is happening.. again...
creations-chat 2020-09-06 22:49:52 quick question: does this look enough like a destroyer ship so far? im worried it might look.. off. If anyone has any suggestions for it, let me know
creations-chat 2020-09-06 22:50:12 oh.. lol hi golden, remember me from yesterday?
creations-chat 2020-10-04 09:07:11 it fits! now how am i suppose to make the take-off?
creations-chat 2020-10-04 09:34:33 > Imagine spending so much time on a creation

creations-chat 2020-10-07 08:14:12 **shitea tonk**
the-dump 2020-10-07 08:19:07 Huh.. glow in the dark pee? Did ya drink that liquid in glow sticks or somethin?
the-dump 2020-10-07 08:21:48 Damn... got a point there XD
creations-chat 2020-10-07 08:25:56 Hmm.. if its a destroyer hull, it needs to “dip” down somewhere in the middle, or “rise” up at the front, as most, if not all, destroyers do
creations-chat 2020-10-07 08:29:36 Ok then, personally im more of a big builds kind of player, a little small for me, looks like from the angle. Could work with it.. add some torpedoes, you got yourself a torpedo boat?
creations-chat 2020-10-07 08:41:34 Well, yes. Good point.. theres a much larger story behind it. From another player, Shadowbladeslaughter, who posted his custom wwII battleship here, It was made from the best aspects of the previous british battleships, in response to the new threat, the “Kiel” class ships, adopting both design styles from other nations, and the precious british battleships
creations-chat 2020-10-07 08:45:07 True, but this is different. I put the torpedoes in the side of the ship hull, a torpedo bay, for closer range fighting, such as if an enemy ship gets close, trying to rush advance on the Cherron, the torpedoes could be fired unexpectedly
creations-chat 2020-10-07 08:48:17 Well, lets say the ship is surrounded on all sides, each turret could only focus on so much, and in the event of all out war, having as many guns as you could may not be a bad idea
creations-chat 2020-10-07 08:52:27 Well... shit.. not really sure what else to say other than it was just added in game.. for.. in game combat?
creations-chat 2020-10-08 08:41:59 Yes! That I agree with.. we need a 1 by 4 half wedge at least
creations-chat 2020-10-08 08:42:26 Or a 2 by 2, 3 by 3, and maybe 4 by 4 triangle wedges
creations-chat 2020-10-08 08:43:20 Ooooh yes, cones.. would look good on things like missiles
creations-chat 2020-10-08 08:45:42 Hmm.. I recognize that. Is it based off a real artillery unit?
creations-chat 2020-10-08 08:46:06 Ahhh yes, that one.
creations-chat 2020-10-17 11:14:53 oh, why, thank you, i tried to get it as close as the real ship as possible, had to search up many blueprints for the superstructure and hull
creations-chat 2020-10-17 11:15:54 nevermind, trying to fit it all in the plot in build mode lol. smoke stacks were a real pain, both of them had separate folding
creations-chat 2020-10-17 11:19:51 if anyones interested as to how I tried to get it as near exact as I could, I just started with one blueprint, and broke it evenly into 4 sections digitally with a line over it, those show the folds. So, from there, I just spotted for parts in the superstructure that would be in the middle of each fold, and worked from the middle out, each side, each fold
creations-chat 2020-10-17 11:27:04 thank you! I appreciate that, glad its a job well done. Ill be sure to use what tricks ive learned on my next builds - which, about that, if you happen to have an idea for what battleship i should do next, let me know! Ive been thinking of doing the HMS Nelson, but all I got for ships are british, thinking of adding other ships in there.
creations-chat 2020-10-17 11:31:01 hmm, it has been awhile since ive done a carrier.. would be interesting, ive always like the way that carrier looked. sure, accepted! ill work on that next
creations-chat 2020-10-17 11:32:03 > what the hell is wrong with slowmode, its 1 min now
<@!581846949901369365> ikr, thats just ridiculous, thought this was a chat to.. ya know.. chat. not wait
creations-chat 2020-10-18 01:24:58 thank you!
creations-chat 2020-10-18 01:26:02 lol this was probably my.. 5th attempt i think at a good looking battleship, had to refer to multiple blueprints and different photo angles
creations-chat 2020-10-18 04:17:25 hey guys, im a little stuck for what ship i should build next. I got a suggestion from Chargloe for a Queen Elizabeth Aircraft Carrier, but now that I put some thought into it, i dont think i really want to do another carrier. If anyone has an idea for a battleship to make, let me know. I was thinking of doing the HMS Nelson, but all my current ships except for the 2 carriers i have are all british, so i want to make another ship from a different country
creations-chat 2020-10-18 04:22:07 hmm.. i might do the HMS Majestic actually.. never done a pre-dreadnaught ship before, could be an interesting build. as for the USS Lexington, its an aircraft carrier, i dont think im gonna do a carrier, i might later on.. feel like doing something with more detail in superstructure
creations-chat 2020-10-19 22:05:30 AHH HELL, PVP CANCER BUILD?? *gets Vietnam flashbacks*
creations-chat 2020-10-19 22:06:32 damn.. 13 downvotes in barely a minute.. thats gotta be a new record
creations-chat 2020-10-19 22:13:33 <@!682677856765214770> damn, thats some good details
creations-chat 2020-10-24 05:13:29 hey, so a quick question, which paint do you think looks better on my YB 35? this, which wasnt actually painted on one i dont think, but i saw it in a colourized blueprint and i kinda liked it, or the gray/chrome paint on top, which ill post a screenshot of, separate
creations-chat 2020-10-24 05:14:45 
creations-chat 2020-10-24 05:16:38 YB
creations-chat 2020-10-24 05:17:51 wait, i think they were same actually, just different variants, but same general design  (this 1 minute slowmode is just... ridiculous)
creations-chat 2020-10-25 10:35:37 > honestly i know this is a thing but i dont like when there is a very very good build like a super carrier or super detailed plane that got drowned by some low effort build so there is a chance that ppl cant look at it imedieatly and they have to scroll up if they want to see and upvote it
<@!525244805756878889> yep, my exact same thoughts.
creations-chat 2020-10-25 10:47:19 i mean, there are 2 good sides to the story, yes he is new and that could genuinely be a good creation to a new player, and would feel proud and deserves it should be posted, but on the other hand, I, for example, when posted my build, a ship, (i really dont mean to sound selfish here) I was hoping it would have a good chance at upvotes, immediately after, whateevr that is under mine got posted, sent it up.. then a couple of other good builds, which im ok with, but then a low effort build that I could probably make in less than half a minute gets posted, sending it up in the chat even more...

creations-chat 2020-10-25 11:08:42 ***shit... ive seen too many of those tutorials i would recognize them anywhere***
creations-chat 2020-10-25 11:11:03 nope, never used a tutorial before, find that it takes away creativity and places a limit by telling you what to build and how to build it... but ive seen it so often, that i can easily recognize it
creations-chat 2020-11-06 00:35:32 https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/384025409945337856/773952763624161331   ta' hell yeah, can get that expert designer rank now! btw, if anyone has any suggestions for my build, let me know. pretty much done from my view, not sure if there is much more to add, but if anyone knows what else the King George V had that i didnt add yet, let me know
creations-chat 2020-11-06 00:42:15 alright, sun in the background "godrays" (thats what those beams of light from the sun are actually called during the right climate) not so great. note taken. was just trying out different angles and with the sun at different positions instead of just the regular default position
creations-chat 2020-11-06 00:47:52 hold up, just to know your opinion, which looks better? sun lower down like in the previous shot, or a bit higher up like in this? or are they both not very good?

creations-chat 2020-11-15 06:19:24 Hey, so, I noticed quite a few people posted their ships with different materials over the hull and superstructure for better detail and texture.. I decided to try this out with my King George V, got half the hull done so far... What do you guys think, should I go with it or nah?
creations-chat 2020-11-16 20:57:32 alright so I continued on the re-texture of my KGV to see how it would look. What do you guys think? I see some ships people make with this texture idea and I think it looked great, especially on a Musashi someone made, but im not sure if this is the ship for the texture.. so yeah, what do you guys think? go with it?
help 2021-01-04 03:46:18 sometimes it's just game mechanics, when its too heavy and is going too fast, it starts shaking if it turns, I think. Im not entirely sure, but that happens to me, and I think that's the cause
creations-chat 2021-02-20 21:04:02 I mean.. Think of it like this, its not the best tank, but its also not the worse. You cant just tell someone to use motor lock and get good, everyone was like that once. There was a time when everyone was bad at building and didnt know how to use motor lock. Instead of saying its bad and hating on a person for the build, say why its bad, and point out what could be improved on
