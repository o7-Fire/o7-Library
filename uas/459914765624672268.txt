The Tale of this (459914765624672268)
creations-chat 2018-12-10 04:39:25 took me way too long rip my life (does work)
help 2018-12-12 07:03:02 erm, is there a reason I can't even talk in the suggestions submissions?
help 2018-12-12 07:05:15 oh, I thought I had ranked up, but now that I see it, my username went from "this" to nonadminsz, which is my ingame user
help 2018-12-12 07:05:18 weird
help 2018-12-12 07:06:18 If you look up through the suggestions, you can find mine too lol
creations-chat 2018-12-13 03:42:45 My attempt at the Saab 35 Draken (the back end looks a lil' ugly because I wanted to make it be able to maneuver well with those motorized elevators)
creations-chat 2018-12-13 04:32:06 no use a bright red-orange light, bathe the world in a scarlet neon glow
help 2018-12-14 00:14:12 so have anyone else's motors been glitching again out ever since the update yesterday?
creations-chat 2019-01-01 12:45:12 
creations-chat 2019-01-01 12:45:45 just a slightly old creation I did
help 2019-01-27 08:52:03 Does anyone know what the "Glass Material" check-box thing does? At first I thought it was to make the glass not merge and look amazing (like it used to be), but it doesn't do that.
help 2019-01-27 09:01:48 Yeah, I was being stupid and thought it would show up while still in building mode
help 2019-01-27 10:20:25 <@456226577798135808> I've heard that that could happen sometimes. I would suggest asking for a rank when you submit the build (I've seen some people do this before). Or what could happen is someone sees your post here and gives you your rank.
creations-chat 2019-01-27 11:54:57 Tried making a YF-17, ended up turning more into a hybrid of it and what it eventually evolved into (the F/A-18).
creations-chat 2019-01-27 15:33:55 just a little sleek boi I made
creations-chat 2019-01-27 15:34:55 actually I drew more inspiration from the MiG-35
creations-chat 2019-01-27 15:35:34 but I do admit the nose makes it look more like a Hornet, I just kinda did my own thing
creations-chat 2019-01-27 15:36:30 I made the cockpit huge so I could actually make the pilot seat look like it belongs there
creations-chat 2019-01-27 15:37:22 here this'll help you get a glimpse of the back of it being more MiG-y
