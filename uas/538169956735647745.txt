creations-chat 2019-08-25 22:59:35 this is a toaster, as you can see, it is not a normal toaster, it has an internal rocket launcher which slides out to shoot, it has 811 blocks
creations-chat 2019-08-25 23:00:16 i have many more of these, don't question me for it
creations-chat 2019-08-25 23:00:18 please
creations-chat 2019-08-25 23:01:32 once the rocket launcher is away, it looks as if there were no weapon there
creations-chat 2019-08-26 22:27:19 sneaky
creations-chat 2019-08-26 23:09:06 ever enjoy when a toaster shoots bread up in the air very high? well now you can aim at people, like in this image, this toaster is launching bread at someone, it is a good one to pull on people because it looks like a normal toaster when put away, and when it come out they won't expect it, i'll put an image of that below this one
creations-chat 2019-08-26 23:09:33 heres the one before it aims and fires bread
creations-chat 2019-08-27 19:22:02 hold on lemme get a photo of my turret
creations-chat 2019-08-27 19:23:13 or atleast a video
creations-chat 2019-08-27 19:29:11 alright here is my turret lol
creations-chat 2019-08-27 20:41:43 this, is a toaster with tank tracks, why? **WELL WHY NOT**
creations-chat 2019-08-28 19:00:30 you know, i was thinking of making a tiny tank, but i gave up on making it small and made this, this 959 block tank treaded beast has 2 main tracks, and a ladder that extends (next picture), thats really it, i'll soon arm it but for now heres the prototype
creations-chat 2019-08-28 19:01:18 and heres the back view with the ladder
creations-chat 2019-08-28 19:01:58 finally something that i submit that isn't a toaster
creations-chat 2019-08-29 19:11:31 its a flying toaster, yes, it can fly, and yes, i have gone crazy
creations-chat 2019-08-30 14:43:04 this.. this is huge. 1557 blocks of.. whatever i should call it, its got a big cannon (which i will soon make it shoot) and a sweet watch tower, why add a watch tower? because it looks sick, and you can't really see whats in front of the tank without it, you know what they say, go big or go home, its also fun to drive in first person
creations-chat 2019-08-30 14:44:58 i dunno
creations-chat 2019-08-30 14:45:08 i was lazy with the turret

events-chat 2022-11-09 01:58:52 original plan was giant scissors, wouldn’t have worked out due to low torque
contest-chat 2022-11-09 02:06:56 goofy internals stuffed in with motorlock
contest-chat 2022-11-09 02:29:18 funny to hold a contest and then an event gets announced
the-dump 2022-11-09 02:35:32 76 bullet
contest-chat 2022-11-09 02:36:54 thats something he can’t submit
contest-chat 2022-11-09 02:37:28 1 is he already built it, you gotta build something from the ground up for the contest
contest-chat 2022-11-09 02:37:37 and 2, lift
contest-chat 2022-11-09 02:37:43 thats really all i know
contest-chat 2022-11-09 02:38:15 but god damn the motorlock on that thing probably has folds for it
events-chat 2022-11-09 16:00:43 is there a force limit on pistons
events-chat 2022-11-09 16:04:24 i gotta make a flipper to use pistons
events-chat 2022-11-09 16:05:08 probably gonna build something incredibly strong
the-dump 2022-11-09 16:17:55 that thing can probably sense fear
events-chat 2022-11-09 16:22:43 i will be the chunkiest mf in battle
events-chat 2022-11-09 16:23:02 none shall weigh more
events-chat 2022-11-09 16:23:09 then my machine
events-chat 2022-11-09 19:01:01 great issues no doubt
events-chat 2022-11-10 01:42:16 flipper?
events-chat 2022-11-10 01:43:36

creations-chat 2022-11-10 11:45:59 fuckin’ knockout, you probably just killed this guy
events-chat 2022-11-10 12:14:18 yes
events-chat 2022-11-10 12:30:38 <@466793357318815744> i will be here on friday i just saw my schedule
events-chat 2022-11-10 14:52:56 i feel more confident seeing the current submissions
events-chat 2022-11-10 15:21:12 oh god i do

events-chat 2022-11-10 16:32:15 hopefully
events-chat 2022-11-10 23:51:33 <@466793357318815744> i've decided to give up on making a vertical flipper because the 5 torque requirement for spinner weapons was not strong enough to make the vertical spinner work consistently
the-dump 2022-11-11 03:43:24 bread 👍
creations-chat 2022-11-11 03:46:46 paint the dots
the-dump 2022-11-11 11:43:45 💀
events-chat 2022-11-11 15:17:17 yes
events-chat 2022-11-11 15:17:52 also i have built a drill, might also incorporate some other spinning bits into the design
events-chat 2022-11-11 15:18:12 also minibots would be cool
events-chat 2022-11-11 15:20:30 i’d rather go for 7x7x5 build space with the same rules as the normal bots since we were given like 55x55x36 or something
events-chat 2022-11-11 15:22:03 mine eclipses this 10x10 rating
events-chat 2022-11-11 15:23:18 mine is a heavyweight with a giant arm to lift others and impale them
events-chat 2022-11-11 15:23:27 because drills are good
events-chat 2022-11-11 15:24:32 and right now i only see tiny bots
events-chat 2022-11-11 15:25:37 i know mint is going to make a horror like no other which will probably hurt big time
events-chat 2022-11-11 16:01:58 i will make funny
events-chat 2022-11-11 16:02:08 from brick to funny
events-chat 2022-11-11 16:02:18 i literally named mine big nuts
events-chat 2022-11-11 16:02:24 i will do something goofy
events-chat 2022-11-11 16:32:38 well if mine can tilt up to block
events-chat 2022-11-11 18:03:12 on the side i’m working on a more stable drone with smoother up and down movement so it may come in handy
events-chat 2022-11-11 18:03:54 i’ve only used it for a very promising test and combat drone
events-chat 2022-11-12 01:03:35 hey rbk, i  got a question
events-chat 2022-11-12 01:04:58 <@466793357318815744> i have an 'unconventional' bot idea, but first I want to ask you whats the dumbest idea for a bot you've heard of since the first event
events-chat 2022-11-12 01:06:56 wow
events-chat 2022-11-12 01:07:01 wait you're kidding right
events-chat 2022-11-12 01:07:16 💀
events-chat 2022-11-12 01:07:21 where is this mf so i can laugh at him
events-chat 2022-11-12 01:08:34 dude
events-chat 2022-11-12 01:08:40 you don't need to LAUNCH them
events-chat 2022-11-12 01:08:43 you just gotta drop them
events-chat 2022-11-12 01:09:14 ok, brilliant idea for you
events-chat 2022-11-12 01:09:31 all you gotta do is spin around
events-chat 2022-11-12 01:09:34 really really fast
events-chat 2022-11-12 01:09:50 and things will spill out in a circle
events-chat 2022-11-12 01:11:02 true
events-chat 2022-11-12 01:11:38 also, that silly and goofy idea of a drone swarm? well you wanna hear something even more funny?
events-chat 2022-11-12 01:12:32 i've given up on a flipper, a drill, and another flipper for this one stand out idea
events-chat 2022-11-12 01:12:35 its
events-chat 2022-11-12 01:12:43 https://tenor.com/view/katana-robot-sword-fight-robot-fight-gif-6148194
events-chat 2022-11-12 01:12:54 mine will be armed with a sword

events-chat 2022-11-12 01:31:52 rbk can i possibly use a suspension block as a slider (its for the sword so it doesn't fall out of place)(yes i know its against the rules)

events-chat 2022-11-12 03:17:29 smoke bomb
events-chat 2022-11-12 05:59:00 going to work on the minibot submission tomorrow, if i dare have to work on that god damn normal bot for another hour i’m gonna go badshit insane
events-chat 2022-11-12 06:00:05 i’ve gone through 5 redesigns with declining results
events-chat 2022-11-12 16:25:08 💀
events-chat 2022-11-12 16:56:27 huge is unstoppable, that percentage is too low
events-chat 2022-11-12 16:56:44 we tried
events-chat 2022-11-12 16:57:28 vertical flipper?
events-chat 2022-11-12 16:57:44 oh
events-chat 2022-11-12 16:57:47 yeah uh, fun fact
events-chat 2022-11-12 16:58:11 bro i don't know man i just woke up
events-chat 2022-11-12 16:58:25 anyways some of the vertical spinners
events-chat 2022-11-12 16:58:49 were **too** powerful despite the 10 torque requirement
events-chat 2022-11-12 16:58:59 wait no its 5 mb
events-chat 2022-11-12 16:59:08 doubt? oh boy
events-chat 2022-11-12 16:59:15 here let me get the clip
events-chat 2022-11-12 17:02:38 ok i can't get the clip my laptop won't let me at the moment so i'll just describe it to you
events-chat 2022-11-12 17:03:23 yeah that
events-chat 2022-11-12 17:03:39 but the one for this event was considered legal
events-chat 2022-11-12 17:05:06 and it was quite strong, able to toss large bots (keep in mind, only 2 ballast beams or 6 ballast blocks, this is for later), so i had the wonderful idea of dropping something heavy on the spinner
events-chat 2022-11-12 17:06:12 something like this, a giant ballast beam filled kinetic bomb that i made to drop on people for shits and giggles because dropping shit is fun
events-chat 2022-11-12 17:06:49 i know
events-chat 2022-11-12 17:06:54 it was just for testing
events-chat 2022-11-12 17:07:24 i'm not using this in the competition, relax
events-chat 2022-11-12 17:07:52 buddy can i fucking continue the story
events-chat 2022-11-12 17:08:45 anyways i drop this on him and it gets launched at mach 2 away from the map
events-chat 2022-11-12 17:09:01 i absolutely agree, those suck
events-chat 2022-11-12 17:29:13 heres an example which has haunted me since the beginning of this challenge, the saw hammer, or as i call it, the swammer
events-chat 2022-11-12 17:31:03 other hammer bots can swing like a pro while mine lifts with the speed of a skeleton
events-chat 2022-11-12 17:33:01 torque stacking isn't allowed from what i've seen
events-chat 2022-11-12 17:33:34 on the rules
events-chat 2022-11-12 17:33:57 oh, yeah that you can do
events-chat 2022-11-12 17:34:01 mb
events-chat 2022-11-12 19:51:18 hey rbk i have a goofy idea
events-chat 2022-11-12 19:53:59 so you remember the saw hammer idea?
events-chat 2022-11-12 19:54:12 well uh, that went bad so i decided to make a
events-chat 2022-11-12 19:54:38 a giant blade
events-chat 2022-11-12 19:54:51 forgive the motorlock, i made a ton of it for redundancy
events-chat 2022-11-12 19:56:19 red sun
events-chat 2022-11-12 20:04:12 but why i'm showing you this funky idea is that the 5 torque motors can **barely** lift it
events-chat 2022-11-12 20:04:17 or swing it
events-chat 2022-11-12 20:04:48 its like giving a skeleton a sledgehammer and telling him to swing it
events-chat 2022-11-12 20:17:14 if we really wanted to do bots
events-chat 2022-11-12 20:17:21 lets complicate things then
events-chat 2022-11-12 20:18:32 lets simulate batteries too by using fuel blocks + 2 small rockets or 2 super rockets (they both cancel each other out)
events-chat 2022-11-12 20:19:50 i wanna hear about the ban actually
events-chat 2022-11-12 20:42:21 <@466793357318815744> can i have more torque on these back motors (currently set to 5 (under-performing)), i'd recommend like 10-15 for a stronger swing (or the ability to swing in general)
events-chat 2022-11-13 01:24:53 yes, because this is what happens when you place 1 block incorrectly
events-chat 2022-11-13 01:25:21 it is undergoing metamorphosis
events-chat 2022-11-13 01:26:12 
events-chat 2022-11-13 01:27:52 how
events-chat 2022-11-13 01:28:14 8th
events-chat 2022-11-13 01:28:15 if i know
events-chat 2022-11-13 01:28:17 knew
events-chat 2022-11-13 01:28:19 i'd say it
events-chat 2022-11-13 01:28:29 i have no genuine idea 💀
events-chat 2022-11-13 01:28:35 nor do i wish to find out
events-chat 2022-11-13 01:29:07 i mean, its a spinner
events-chat 2022-11-13 01:29:59 i have no idea when this is going to stop but i want to see more
events-chat 2022-11-13 02:11:22 yes rbk is driving the most horrifying bot
events-chat 2022-11-13 02:12:36 unless someone makes icewave, we are all fucked
events-chat 2022-11-13 02:14:32 unless someone makes deep six, we're all fucked
events-chat 2022-11-13 02:14:41 actually no
events-chat 2022-11-13 02:14:53 have you seen rbk use huge in pc
events-chat 2022-11-13 02:15:03 alright
events-chat 2022-11-13 02:15:05 so basically
events-chat 2022-11-13 02:15:13 there is no running, there is no hiding
events-chat 2022-11-13 02:15:20 you are going to die
events-chat 2022-11-13 02:16:12 i've only done that once
events-chat 2022-11-13 02:16:54 and plus the one rbk is using is modified, the stabilizers are stronger
events-chat 2022-11-13 02:17:33 and also lets not forget this is roblox physics
events-chat 2022-11-13 02:17:59 also plane crazy
events-chat 2022-11-13 02:18:43 whatever you THINK is going to work will not work
events-chat 2022-11-13 02:19:14 it took 4 people to get rid of a wheel
events-chat 2022-11-13 02:19:20 **4**
events-chat 2022-11-13 02:19:36 actually, we have yet to prove that one
events-chat 2022-11-13 02:19:48 oh
events-chat 2022-11-13 02:19:55 well i didn't know <:clueless:942802644043464734>
events-chat 2022-11-13 02:20:51 i'm still trying to get a good design 💀
events-chat 2022-11-13 02:21:13 this is the **3rd** time i've had to start from the ground up
events-chat 2022-11-13 02:23:47 i started with a large custom with a very big bucket type thing you'd see on heavy industrial machinery (BIIIIIIIG BIG PISTONS) which worked well on hard countering mint
events-chat 2022-11-13 02:26:54 heres v1, big and chunky
events-chat 2022-11-13 02:27:09 designed like shit, preformed decently
events-chat 2022-11-13 02:27:33 to be fair
events-chat 2022-11-13 02:27:37 no one had a spear
events-chat 2022-11-13 02:28:23 they couldn't get in there and if anything was going to swing at me from above i can block the attack
events-chat 2022-11-13 02:28:46 and did i mention the drill?
events-chat 2022-11-13 02:29:32 i just wanna build something that works
events-chat 2022-11-13 02:29:56 hey rbk, you got a visitor
events-chat 2022-11-13 02:31:04 yeah so after i decided against moving on from the drill and used a long drum to actually flip
events-chat 2022-11-13 02:31:37 that failed due to unknown reasons (the bullshit torque requirement)
events-chat 2022-11-13 02:32:06 so i ditched the whole thing and said 'sword robot'
events-chat 2022-11-13 02:32:25 so i tried to make a bot with a robotic arm mounted up top holding a sword
events-chat 2022-11-13 02:32:35 no
events-chat 2022-11-13 02:32:41 it just sucked
events-chat 2022-11-13 02:33:05 well berry
events-chat 2022-11-13 02:33:17 my plan was something like this
events-chat 2022-11-13 02:33:22 https://tenor.com/view/katana-robot-sword-fight-robot-fight-gif-6148194
events-chat 2022-11-13 02:33:27 take one of these
events-chat 2022-11-13 02:33:29 slap it on top
events-chat 2022-11-13 02:33:32 dominate
events-chat 2022-11-13 02:33:44 **it did not work at all**
events-chat 2022-11-13 02:33:57 torque requirements killed it
events-chat 2022-11-13 02:34:01 of all things
events-chat 2022-11-13 02:34:51 but the big claim to fame was the blade itself
events-chat 2022-11-13 02:35:19 it was suppose to be an HF blade
events-chat 2022-11-13 02:35:31 where the cutters on it slide back and forth incredibly fast
events-chat 2022-11-13 02:35:40 and just shred anything it touches
events-chat 2022-11-13 02:36:18 **however, for that amount of speed, i would need a suspension block to keep the thing together, oh boy**
events-chat 2022-11-13 02:36:28 ***i wish i had one***
events-chat 2022-11-13 02:36:38 so i gave up on that
events-chat 2022-11-13 02:36:56 kept the base because it was decent
events-chat 2022-11-13 02:39:59 and then ended up with a saw hammer thing
events-chat 2022-11-13 02:40:39 it failed because the saw hammer on the end of an arm was too heavy (**the torque requirement**)
events-chat 2022-11-13 02:42:46 mine is named big nuts...
events-chat 2022-11-13 02:43:04 fuck it, i'll make chains
events-chat 2022-11-13 02:43:13 i will
events-chat 2022-11-13 02:43:16 but wait
events-chat 2022-11-13 02:43:21 **how do i stay upright**
events-chat 2022-11-13 02:43:43 ok
events-chat 2022-11-13 02:43:47 no stability
events-chat 2022-11-13 02:44:12 true..
events-chat 2022-11-13 02:44:23 how the fuck did i forget i could do that
events-chat 2022-11-13 02:46:15 can i ask how that runs so well
events-chat 2022-11-13 02:46:36 i love the slight delay
events-chat 2022-11-13 02:47:33 the power

events-chat 2022-11-13 02:56:52 so am i stuck to the 2 ballast beam or 6 ballast block rule
events-chat 2022-11-13 02:57:02 or can i get a little goofy for nuts 2
events-chat 2022-11-13 02:58:23 the bits on the end
events-chat 2022-11-13 02:58:34 ah that works too
events-chat 2022-11-13 02:58:38 what about wing panels
events-chat 2022-11-13 02:58:54 yeah but
events-chat 2022-11-13 02:58:57 how many
events-chat 2022-11-13 02:59:07 💀
events-chat 2022-11-13 03:00:10 totally
events-chat 2022-11-13 03:03:46 use the gravity slider
events-chat 2022-11-13 03:04:04 yeah most of us did
events-chat 2022-11-13 03:24:18 
events-chat 2022-11-13 03:24:24 simply a bit of trolling
events-chat 2022-11-13 03:25:21 i can't even tell what thats suppose to be
events-chat 2022-11-13 03:25:48 💀
events-chat 2022-11-13 03:26:23 the pros of getting handed a design is its easy, no research, no hard time finding what works
events-chat 2022-11-13 03:26:36 the cons is **everyone knows what you're doing**
events-chat 2022-11-13 03:27:09 i'm making nuts 2
events-chat 2022-11-13 03:27:25 nuts 2
events-chat 2022-11-13 03:29:09 the executioner robot was suppose to work well
events-chat 2022-11-13 03:29:12 but then it didn't
events-chat 2022-11-13 03:30:47 i will make **nuts 2**
events-chat 2022-11-13 03:31:43 you cannot stop me from making nuts 2

events-chat 2022-11-13 03:33:24 if you can make my failed executioner bot work
events-chat 2022-11-13 03:33:33 i might stop with nuts 2

events-chat 2022-11-13 04:22:49 <@466793357318815744> unrelated question but can suspension be allowed if these are the settings?
events-chat 2022-11-13 04:23:22 because at that point
events-chat 2022-11-13 04:23:24 its just a rod

creations-chat 2022-11-13 06:38:18 hes not dead hes just gone, you literally reduced him to nothing
events-chat 2022-11-13 06:39:04 rbk, mint, and berry are the scariest of the bunch, this is objective fact
events-chat 2022-11-13 06:41:41 must be the greatest pirate i’ve ever seen
creations-chat 2022-11-13 06:59:08 yeah how about you build a jet that looks better then mig’s if it sucks?
i think that would be interesting to see play out, how about you?
(also it doesn’t suck, you are wrong)
events-chat 2022-11-13 13:25:24 hmmmm
events-chat 2022-11-13 13:26:05 he has a gang of bots

events-chat 2022-11-13 13:34:52 why are you using message requests just dm me we share a server (this one)
events-chat 2022-11-13 13:35:50 yeah i saw
events-chat 2022-11-13 13:37:51 nah you're good
events-chat 2022-11-13 13:38:16 well theres a way to fix that
events-chat 2022-11-13 13:38:33 just chat more and get to level 3, then you can shitpost anywhere but general
events-chat 2022-11-13 13:43:06 on god red devil is the coolest, giant sawblade, clamp your opponent and **cut**
events-chat 2022-11-13 13:45:13 low torque requirement 💀
events-chat 2022-11-13 13:50:30 also more points of failure
events-chat 2022-11-13 13:54:45 keeping **most** things simple and effective will make you last longer
events-chat 2022-11-13 13:55:10 i'm sure you know this since you're familiar with bot fights
events-chat 2022-11-13 15:53:11 <@466793357318815744> the sword bot is now legal <:trollface:775024642104229898>

events-chat 2022-11-13 18:09:02 yeah
events-chat 2022-11-13 18:09:06 ain't no one
events-chat 2022-11-13 18:09:27 <@434843195025653762> your bot is glitching out due to the sheer amount of wheels and speed
events-chat 2022-11-13 18:09:57 mine has no trouble
events-chat 2022-11-13 18:10:36 **last i checked 100 speed is bad**
events-chat 2022-11-13 18:11:30 gonna say it right now there is an easier way to do this suri
events-chat 2022-11-13 18:11:46 yes
events-chat 2022-11-13 18:12:33 you can just use 1 motor for each wheel, you know that right?
events-chat 2022-11-13 18:13:21 ever hear of what i call the 'ASD' method?
events-chat 2022-11-13 18:13:32 ok

events-chat 2022-11-14 03:41:17 actually
events-chat 2022-11-14 03:41:26 no that would have failed due to torque requirements

events-chat 2022-11-14 14:53:09 can’t post mov files 💀
events-chat 2022-11-14 14:59:33 i hoped this worked
events-chat 2022-11-14 14:59:36 it did
events-chat 2022-11-14 14:59:39 great
events-chat 2022-11-14 15:00:14 i marked out every time i saw the cutters on berry’s bot deal NO damage
events-chat 2022-11-14 15:00:39 well
events-chat 2022-11-14 15:01:07 a short moment because i don’t have much file space open right now
events-chat 2022-11-14 15:01:27 i’ll be adding goofy sound effects soon
events-chat 2022-11-14 15:03:59 also at some points the saws clip through berry
events-chat 2022-11-14 15:19:27 i agree
events-chat 2022-11-14 15:19:53 if not a ban, we should just keep an eye on
events-chat 2022-11-14 15:20:02 a very sharp eye.. OR
events-chat 2022-11-14 15:20:58 maybe we could try to find a pvp server that is empty
events-chat 2022-11-14 15:21:05 but that
events-chat 2022-11-14 15:21:08 that is impossible
events-chat 2022-11-14 15:21:31 https://tenor.com/view/plane-crazy-gif-25805187
events-chat 2022-11-14 15:21:52 the only reason i mentioned the pvp server idea is so pug wouldn’t be able to turn off pvp
events-chat 2022-11-14 15:22:26 that works for me
events-chat 2022-11-14 15:22:48 yeah thats the big problem
events-chat 2022-11-14 15:23:26 doesn’t pug play on mobile
events-chat 2022-11-14 15:23:52 he can still stream
events-chat 2022-11-14 15:23:55 it is possible
events-chat 2022-11-14 15:26:51 sounds good
creations-chat 2022-11-14 15:51:37 doubt, if it was a joke its expired and it also sucks, i recommend going to a comedy class
creations-chat 2022-11-14 15:54:32 yes
events-chat 2022-11-14 16:04:56 pug will tap dance around it for sure
events-chat 2022-11-14 16:05:50 how about this: no stream no participation
events-chat 2022-11-14 19:16:21 join call, share screen, open roblox, go from there
events-chat 2022-11-14 19:17:12 i’m going to go test to make sure
events-chat 2022-11-14 19:18:03 mf i can stream and open roblox
events-chat 2022-11-14 19:18:15 from my phone
events-chat 2022-11-14 19:19:44 i feel like you’re just saying that to not have to stream
events-chat 2022-11-14 19:24:17 apple, and you’re hiding something
events-chat 2022-11-14 19:24:46 yes
events-chat 2022-11-14 19:26:04 unless you need to grab some updates you should be fine
events-chat 2022-11-14 19:27:22 give it a go and we’ll see
events-chat 2022-11-14 19:55:04 interesting choice for armor
events-chat 2022-11-14 20:01:02 i like how mines come out since the 8th design change
events-chat 2022-11-14 20:05:40 that looks pretty nice
events-chat 2022-11-14 20:06:52 yeah, i'm a sucker for armor that looks like that, very cool
events-chat 2022-11-14 20:08:52 i still gotta fix up the drill on my bot
events-chat 2022-11-14 20:09:52 mines custom because i suck at recreating stuff
events-chat 2022-11-14 20:12:10 the weaponry
events-chat 2022-11-14 20:12:57 2 decently sized drills and top bit to protect the motors
events-chat 2022-11-14 20:14:10 i gave it good looking spotlights too
events-chat 2022-11-14 20:15:09 they aren't lights
events-chat 2022-11-14 20:15:28 they're snow pipes for decoration
events-chat 2022-11-14 20:16:19 and for death staring the opponent
events-chat 2022-11-14 20:17:07 yeah
events-chat 2022-11-14 20:26:21 i would but my bot is too heavy
events-chat 2022-11-14 20:37:01 you'd be suprised
events-chat 2022-11-14 20:39:07 mood
events-chat 2022-11-14 20:41:54 not really *big*
events-chat 2022-11-14 20:44:53 not as aggressive as the one with the sword
events-chat 2022-11-14 20:50:18 you should see the first design
events-chat 2022-11-14 20:50:22 that thing was a tanker
events-chat 2022-11-14 20:51:51 my 6th design (named executioner) used the same base as my current one, and has 3044 blocks
events-chat 2022-11-14 20:52:29 amongus
events-chat 2022-11-14 20:53:47 incredibly complex for one reason or another (that damn blade)
events-chat 2022-11-14 20:54:28 i fucking hated this thing, it worked but it was horrible and was right on the red line
events-chat 2022-11-14 20:54:47 **the mechanical problems**
events-chat 2022-11-14 21:00:40 too many things i had to iron out and i just gave up and switched to drills
events-chat 2022-11-14 21:05:59 fear
events-chat 2022-11-14 21:06:28 i gotta armor up my bot more, those cutters look spooky
help 2022-11-14 21:16:25 keep it like that

events-chat 2022-11-15 03:52:35 theres **1** spot left
events-chat 2022-11-15 03:56:07 no you don’t, the arena is completely flat
events-chat 2022-11-15 03:56:23 despite what suri says
events-chat 2022-11-15 03:57:58 its because you designed your drive system stupid
events-chat 2022-11-15 03:58:12 your bot is **glitching out**
events-chat 2022-11-15 03:58:52 your wheels are spinning so hard and so fast that the game struggles
events-chat 2022-11-15 04:00:10 yes
events-chat 2022-11-15 04:00:16 so slooooow the thing down
events-chat 2022-11-15 04:00:50 oh yeah, lets not forget that
events-chat 2022-11-15 04:05:22 really
events-chat 2022-11-15 04:06:41 thats a joke right
events-chat 2022-11-15 04:13:14 you think it doing THIS is fine
events-chat 2022-11-15 04:14:11 and you’re fine when someone gets launched a quarter of the way to the sun when it eventually does this
events-chat 2022-11-15 04:14:25 because it happened to me
events-chat 2022-11-15 04:17:52 all i’m saying is 200 torque per motor would fix your problems, but if you wanna be stubborn about it sure, be my guest
events-chat 2022-11-15 04:19:26 guess what a 200 torque limit would fix?
events-chat 2022-11-15 04:20:04 because less force, you gotta experience it to understand it
events-chat 2022-11-15 04:21:26 with 1k your wheels slide
events-chat 2022-11-15 04:21:51 there is not enough traction in this game to put that power to the ground
events-chat 2022-11-15 04:22:07 and you’re using 5x5 cylinders
events-chat 2022-11-15 04:22:30 thats a lot of spinning
events-chat 2022-11-15 04:22:50 but also theres 32 wheels, each 2 blocks wide
events-chat 2022-11-15 04:23:12 looked like 2 mb
events-chat 2022-11-15 04:23:41 but also you’re using 2 motors per wheel
events-chat 2022-11-15 04:23:54 not counting the unpowered one
events-chat 2022-11-15 04:24:07 which means you have 64 motors to drive your bot
events-chat 2022-11-15 04:24:50 you have a grand total of 64k torque from all the powered motors combined
events-chat 2022-11-15 04:25:49 i’d like you to take a wild guess how much of that is getting down to the ground to move you  forward due to the wheel slipping
events-chat 2022-11-15 04:27:26 i’m fairly certain its well under that even with fabric wheels
events-chat 2022-11-15 04:27:44 yeah you’re using a 2 motor setup, i can only wonder
events-chat 2022-11-15 04:28:22 i’d say you’re getting around 10-20% of that power to the ground
events-chat 2022-11-15 04:28:52 the 2 motor setup
events-chat 2022-11-15 04:28:57 unless one is locked
events-chat 2022-11-15 04:29:09 is one locked
events-chat 2022-11-15 04:29:22 ok
events-chat 2022-11-15 04:30:19 you have 2 motors
events-chat 2022-11-15 04:30:23 one for forward
events-chat 2022-11-15 04:30:25 and back
events-chat 2022-11-15 04:30:32 one for turning
events-chat 2022-11-15 04:30:52 yeah
events-chat 2022-11-15 04:30:54 thats true
events-chat 2022-11-15 04:31:54 stacked motors are funky though

events-chat 2022-11-15 19:34:50 and also big boy damage
events-chat 2022-11-15 19:35:02 pug quit it you literally took a chunk out
events-chat 2022-11-15 19:35:54 yeah whats the video pug
events-chat 2022-11-15 19:36:06 don't tap dance around that pug
events-chat 2022-11-15 19:36:22 you know the game your playing
events-chat 2022-11-15 19:36:29 and i do too
events-chat 2022-11-15 19:36:55 so tell me, in this video your pvp was **off** right?
events-chat 2022-11-15 19:38:23 they're right there
events-chat 2022-11-15 19:38:40 and i heavily doubt thats what happened
events-chat 2022-11-15 19:39:02 what actually happened is you turned pvp back on when shit got to obvious
events-chat 2022-11-15 19:39:25 and then your bot broke because its built like a  knockoff
events-chat 2022-11-15 19:40:23 with blades having a similar fragility to your ability to lie
events-chat 2022-11-15 19:41:03 no
events-chat 2022-11-15 19:41:12 it just means you can hurt yourself
events-chat 2022-11-15 19:42:00 this is simple pug
events-chat 2022-11-15 19:43:07 absolutely by some bullshit pvp switching
events-chat 2022-11-15 19:43:11 or something else
events-chat 2022-11-15 19:44:29 i still doubt that knowing you
events-chat 2022-11-15 19:44:38 and that very special clip
events-chat 2022-11-15 19:44:49 which i will be making more off
