bot-central 2022-08-17 18:31:29 &suggestion Loading Multiple Saves.  It would be awesome if there were a feature that made it so that you could load in 2 save files at once, then, if you had lets say a landing gear mechanism you could simply load it in and place it where it is needed instead of rebuilding it. This probably won't be useful for small mechanisms but could be beneficial for pros to take less time on builds.
