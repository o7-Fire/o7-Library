creations-chat 2021-08-07 03:28:32 how can i make my F-5 better?
creations-chat 2021-08-07 03:32:21 Thanks. ill see what i can do.
creations-chat 2021-08-07 03:34:34 im broke xd. the fanta is doable but idk about a new chair. also im 3 states from home rn
creations-chat 2021-08-07 04:35:50 how? the fuselage is 3 blocks wide then and 7 at the widest part of the engine
creations-chat 2021-08-07 04:38:31 also thats a newer F-5 variant. mine is an E from the 70s. probably the only thing i could do is make the intakes smaller and maybe do the same for the engine section but idk. im still p new
creations-chat 2021-08-07 04:41:31 i bet i could maybe make the sides a half block or block thinner
creations-chat 2021-08-07 04:44:26 yeah ok i see it now. the intakes are way to big along with the rest of it. how could i make a less sharp angle to match that of the real F-5?
creations-chat 2021-08-07 04:47:01 i did

creations-chat 2021-09-02 09:04:02 well, it would decrease structural integrity of the wings since the engines are pulling them away from the plane. the thrust probably wouldnt do too much to the fuselage tho.

creations-chat 2021-09-07 05:09:01 because hes an annoying, egotistical asshole who belittles new players yet acts like a little angel whenever anyone talks about it. 
like that asshole kid in elementary who would hit you but then act sweet and like the victim whenever questioned by the teacher
creations-chat 2021-09-07 05:11:32 you dont know the whole history lmao
creations-chat 2021-09-07 05:14:43 the past aka 5 hours ago. shut up no one likes you or cares what you think. youve already ruined your reputation and even if you did somehow change in 5 hours no one cares anyway.
creations-chat 2021-09-07 05:18:34 he got a massively inflated ego because two of his builds where well received and has been a massive asshole ever since. he tries to troll but is just unfunny. literally the only reason he speaks is to tell people how shit they are at the game. and as i said, whenever you talk about it he gets all pissy and acts like hes changed and all that bullshit.
creations-chat 2021-09-07 05:21:13 the actual definition plus hes just an all-around ass
creations-chat 2021-09-07 05:23:25 really sad that youre only defense at this point is “but im tolerable **today**!”

creations-chat 2021-09-11 00:30:05 its an American memorial day. therefore its mm/dd
creations-chat 2021-09-11 05:55:37 <@!761479350934831125> i get the size is limiting and the phantom is a pain in the ass (trust me, i really do know lmao), but i think you couldve done way better. 

1: the intakes look more like the F-5s tbh. the phantoms intakes sit on top of the wings, not level with them, are more square than round, and the half wedge on the front of the intake should be the other way around. 

2: the horizontal stabilizers are way too big.

3: the vertical stabilizer is too small

4: the wings are way way too small. 

5: the spine is too tall. 

6: the cockpit framing isnt even painted (????).

7: the fuselage is too long.

7: motorlock the trails into the plane so they arent on the outside.

8: the nose is way too short.
creations-chat 2021-09-11 05:58:10 <@718545872522051606> it looks really good but you should fix the exposed motorlocks
creations-chat 2021-09-11 06:00:12 <@!761479350934831125> also i just realized, you didnt use motor 2 servos for the wings or horizontal stabs?? bruh 💀

creations-chat 2021-09-26 19:04:17 ok, that tower would be very easy to lengthen. i would add 2-3 more levels and then use it to add text and symbols to the plane
creations-chat 2021-09-26 19:06:32 well since its a custom, add your username under the cockpit, put some symbols on the tail, maybe some insignias on the wings and fuselage as well

creations-chat 2021-09-27 07:45:28 see, id love to give him pointers, but the issue is that everytime he makes a minuscule change, he posts it in creations. it gets really annoying seeing basically the exact same build over and over and over
hes posted the plane 12 times. you cant tell me thats justified after maybe the 3rd or 4th time. he should only be posting it in feedback for now
bot-central 2021-09-27 07:51:57 how make suggestion

creations-chat 2021-09-27 08:59:45 oh wait i habgr movdel

wings are still wrong, the transition from the intakes into the wings is very abrupt and not rounded at all

wing shape is still wrong. only half of the wing is swept

the horizontal stabilizers are way off, also its missing engines
creations-chat 2021-09-27 09:19:51 too big, the engines needa be a block shorter. other than that it’s perfect
creations-chat 2021-09-27 09:23:03 yes, now fix the horizontal stabilizers
creations-chat 2021-09-27 09:28:01 the back is way too angled
creations-chat 2021-09-27 09:31:34 these horizontals are perfect
creations-chat 2021-09-27 09:38:15 yeah my ecto 1 got no feedback when i was posting it in here a few days ago. ppl rlly havent been giving to much feedback

speaking of my ecto, should i post this new, improved version in creations or are the changes too unnoticeable? https://streamable.com/p7wbts
creations-chat 2021-09-27 09:49:03 hehe thanks

Hi GammaRad :)
creations-chat 2021-09-27 11:01:06 it extends to the end of the cockpit. so make it longer by half a block. also im p sure theyre just to reduce drag
creations-chat 2021-09-27 11:03:50 w 

also it looks really uninteresting at that scale. use 1x2 cylinders so you can add detail
creations-chat 2021-09-27 11:09:58 fold
creations-chat 2021-09-27 11:13:06 whats with the block of shit. j bet your build doesnt even resemble a mech. you should try motorlocking
creations-chat 2021-09-27 11:15:20 couldnt you seriously just give it a knife or something? youll seriously give yourself an aneurysm trying to make that

creations-chat 2021-09-29 10:48:26 not when you post ❤️❤️
creations-chat 2021-09-29 10:50:54 it is not lmao its very basic, cheese grater wings, not detailed, and looks like it has zero motorlock whatsoever
also the proportions suck
creations-chat 2021-09-29 10:53:32 HAHAHAHA

yeah ive seen plenty of good builds that have used none or very minimal motorlock. that n1 could certainly use some however. i wouldnt mention motorlock if i didnt think it needed it.
creations-chat 2021-09-29 10:57:00 you either make it massive so you can use the blocks as intended, use motorlock to make it small-medium, or use no motorlock and make it small and make it look terrible
creations-chat 2021-09-29 10:59:31 6 am creations sucks lmao. bush post something good to cleanse our eyes
or weep.
or anyone please
creations-chat 2021-09-29 11:02:34 at this point i cant build something without atleast 1 motorlock

creations-chat 2021-09-30 04:10:41 nope. i submitted my ecto-1 and got no upvotes. they like exceptional builds, not good or great ones

creations-chat 2021-09-30 04:31:44 i got 150 on my ecto. i forgot to boost my ego gimme a second
creations-chat 2021-09-30 04:37:21 lmao thats how it was with my abrams. it got like 70 upvotes and my ego went through the roof. ecto-1 gets hella upvotes and it did nothing lol

hi
creations-chat 2021-09-30 04:40:06 tbh i feel like once you get good enough you dont get ego boosts from upvotes, just happy. honestly i did get a little bit more confidence in terms of my motorlock skills from the ecto.
creations-chat 2021-09-30 04:43:24 yeah. the best way to measure build quality is by contacting experts or just posting it in here.
i wouldnt say masters are good for feedback since they never really post here lmao
creations-chat 2021-09-30 04:46:17 tbh there should be an expert designer chat, since its definitely the hardest expert role to get. then we can all have a secret hang out 😎

creations-chat 2021-10-10 22:17:04 why do people post sirens so much
creations-chat 2021-10-10 22:22:19 yeah but the thing is is that sirens are kind of a weird thing to fixate on in a vehicle building game. i can understand cars, planes, trains, boats, mechs, hell even animals and shit, but why sirens?

yes but why sirens? theres always one or two people who make unique and interesting things. i just think its odd that so many people make sirens.

creations-chat 2021-10-11 03:04:19 yeah but they arent women trying to be men. they are somewhat masculine women with very distinct female characteristics. the_mechanics pfp is literally a guy trying to be a woman and it makes my monkey brain very confused and sad
creations-chat 2021-10-11 03:06:40 if tomboys are gay then femboys are straight now stfu
creations-chat 2021-10-11 03:09:12 im liking the woman because , and this is important, she is a **woman** with masculine features. not gay.
creations-chat 2021-10-11 03:11:22 i agree. i dont like men. i like women. but i like strong women that could beat the shit out of me if need be. p sure the liking strong women thing dates back to cavemen when you wanted your honey to be able to fight off a predator if it was attacking you

i dont even care im upvoting it
creations-chat 2021-10-12 05:35:55 studs are the roblox unit of measurement. i believe its like 0.85 meters iirc. so the speed number is not miles per hour. i dont care to know the actual conversation so i just call it speed numbers

creations-chat 2021-10-12 05:56:48 18k sps is 2000mph. so very accurate to the real plane

the real plane would travel at about  sps wait no im stupid

the real plane would travel at 19.6k sps in game
creations-chat 2021-10-12 06:01:07 <@!778226997427568662> 
1 meter = 20 studs
19600 (sps)/20 = 980
980 meters per second = 2193 mph

(i rounded away the decimals)
creations-chat 2021-10-12 06:03:09 that seems wrong give me a second
creations-chat 2021-10-12 06:05:49 <@!778226997427568662> well the math is right but the plane crazy speed of sound is way off. honestly sps is stupid anyway because a robloxian is 25 centimeters tall. since they are 5 studs tall.
creations-chat 2021-10-12 06:07:54 im american so i did mph cause im still learning metric conversions
3529 kph is 2193 mph
creations-chat 2021-10-12 06:12:54 wait, if 20 studs = 1 meter, and the speed of sound is 343 mps, then the plane crazy speed of sound is 6860 sps, not 3920. so 6860 x 2.8 is 19208 HAHA I WAS RIGHT LETS GO
well i was closer than you 💀😎

bruh. why the fuck did you not tell be 1 meter is 4 studs.

at least i was right when it comes to the old stud size
creations-chat 2021-10-12 06:16:44 wow i never thought i would ever have a math battle over a fucking video game

creations-chat 2021-10-12 06:24:20 *chugs coors beer* aight im good i forgot i have no way to kill myself
creations-chat 2021-10-12 06:26:58 imma calculate the speed of light brb

creations-chat 2021-10-12 06:32:41 <@!434087698316263435> bruh why you downvote all my creations. are you one of those mfs who downvotes just for <:FineTroll:626841259746656289>
creations-chat 2021-10-12 06:43:34 hmm, i need an editing software for that but hell yeah. ill do it tomorrow. a block is 0.85 meters so i can count how many blocks the shockwave travels in a second and calculate if the shockwave is an accurate speed with the equation 0.85x = y

or <@!778226997427568662> could do it rn if he has the time
wait that equation might not be enough, gimme a second
creations-chat 2021-10-12 06:47:23 damn bruh my brain working over time cause its almost 2 am and im only good at math around 3 hours after ive woken up
creations-chat 2021-10-12 06:52:18 ok so if 1 block is 0.85 meters, and the speed of a real explosive shockwave is 340 meters per second, the plane crazy shockwave would need to travel 391 blocks per second to be accurate.
now to test it
creations-chat 2021-10-12 06:55:13 i get 50-60 fps on max graphics. the human eye can see about 30-60 so it wont affect the results. also the length of the shockwave duration doesnt matter because i can see how long it did go in however long it lasted and see if its accurate
creations-chat 2021-10-12 06:57:40 plane crazy r&d is really fun idk why. 
we should do this more and make 1:1 scale models for scaling. 

btw, do you think you could test it for me? just rq make a black and white checkerboard pattern the length of your plot, then place a plane crazy tnt block on it about 2 blocks away and detonate it while recording
creations-chat 2021-10-12 06:59:42 nah its too interesting to be private. see if the power and scale even effect the shockwave first. if it doesnt then just make it so it wont damage the checkerboard
creations-chat 2021-10-12 07:02:08 if the tnt settings do effect the shockwave, im gonna have to calculate what settings are accurate to the real speed of sound
creations-chat 2021-10-12 07:09:41 yeah but thats boring as fuck so using meters is harder and more fun.
creations-chat 2021-10-12 07:14:13 i already said. its harder and therefore more fun. cry about it. also yeah we were gonna measure the speed of the shockwave. cry about it again.

<@723940197456281640> europeans when its a quarter pounder and not a 0.1133981 kilogrammer
creations-chat 2021-10-12 07:16:43 cool. we still wanna measure it. idk why youre crying about us doing math and enjoying it. you need to cope hard if people enjoying something makes you uncomfortable
creations-chat 2021-10-12 07:20:02 well first of all, you dont even understand what we’re doing, so that says a lot lmao. second, youre the one spending 10 minutes telling me this is ridiculous and unnecessary
creations-chat 2021-10-12 07:22:31 hah aight so we got a lot more math to do. so could you do me a favor and make the measuring stick thing the length of the plot? it’s literally impossible to see the 2500 pressure wave. also im just gonna use capcut which only goes down to 0.1s
creations-chat 2021-10-12 07:24:32 its very noticeably different. wait its not, its the same nvm again it is different 

<@!669343312326557716> aight will do
creations-chat 2021-10-12 07:27:31 da google doc about video game speed of sound measurements
creations-chat 2021-10-12 07:38:52 aight yeah theyre the same. imma calculate how fast it is now gimme a second
creations-chat 2021-10-12 07:43:53 <@!720891502108344360> <@!669343312326557716> 
the shockwave moves at 40 blocks per second or 34 meters per second

the shockwave moves slower than my 2012 rav4 💀

the shockwave moved 12 blocks in 0.3 seconds which is 40 blocks per second. 34 meters per second is 76 mph 🗿
creations-chat 2021-10-12 07:48:08 i honestly wish the blast pressure wouldve effected the shockwave. it wouldve been much more satisfying to calculate what blast pressure matched the speed of sound

<@!669343312326557716> its about 1327 sps
creations-chat 2021-10-12 07:51:10 <@!720891502108344360> in game speed of the shockwave is 136 sps
creations-chat 2021-10-12 07:54:26 aight cad, see if fireworks and rockets have a different shockwave. fly wants to see if they do
creations-chat 2021-10-12 07:57:17 🗿

imma be honest im kinda sad how mundane that answer was 

“ok so i wonder if this virtual explosion matches the speed of the real speed of sound. of course we are going to measure it in ingame units and convert them to real life units”

“so it turns out the shockwave follows US interstate speed limits”
creations-chat 2021-10-12 08:07:54 i am genuinely saddened by this. we just spent 2 hours doing math all for it to culminate in a virtual explosion going 76 miles per hour <:empty:794431705070174238>
creations-chat 2021-10-12 08:09:57 the sound barrier is either 76 mph or the explosion is magically subsonic 

at least it isnt rocket league where the speed of sound is literally 40 mph
creations-chat 2021-10-12 08:12:38 no we are crying about video game math

<@!720891502108344360> that means ive scored mach 3+ goals ☠️
creations-chat 2021-10-12 08:18:20 fuck it. im saying the explosion is sub sonic. theres more evidence that its subsonic than there is that the speed of sound is 76 mph. besides, a roblox speed of sound being 800 mph is nice bc its only 33 mph off the real speed of sound
creations-chat 2021-10-12 08:20:43 slow combustion <:empty:794431705070174238>

effort =/= good
experience =/= good (well a experienced player is more likely to be good but there isnt a direct correlation)

<@!761313821235085324> youll get there eventually. ground vehicles are much easier than planes. also it really is ass. theres just a major lack of detail for a build so massive
creations-chat 2021-10-12 18:54:14 yes. although functionality isnt my no. 1 priority. i strive for good looks and resemblance over all else
creations-chat 2021-10-12 18:56:16 how to detail 101

creations-chat 2021-10-13 05:05:37 literally me and cad last night
im still pissed the speed of sound is 76 mph <:lmfao:527971550360633393>
creations-chat 2021-10-13 05:21:02 me? 👉👈🥺
creations-chat 2021-10-13 05:29:27 or commit rocket league and break the sound barrier on a snowboard
creations-chat 2021-10-13 05:31:45 uh……
what about the speed of the pvp weapons? like how fast bullets, rockets, and fireworks travel?
creations-chat 2021-10-13 05:34:26 bullets = barbie scooter speed
rockets = low end RC helicopter
firework = baby
creations-chat 2021-10-13 05:44:48 since the bullets are literally longer than the ruler, could you make the ruler longer and move the camera up? ill get calculating on the other 2
creations-chat 2021-10-13 05:52:47 rocket = 71 mph (21 blocks in 0.2 seconds = 105 blocks a second. 1 block is about a foot long.)

firework = 109 mph (16 blocks in 0.1 seconds = 160 blocks a second

<@!707133341454958604> so basically, we tested the speed of a tnt block shockwave. a explosion goes the speed of sound. using the ruler you see in cads last two videos. i determined the shockwave moves at 111 fps or 76 mph

(the actual in game speed of sound is about 15 mph faster than the real speed of sound, but we just want to make fun of the roblox explosion effect)
creations-chat 2021-10-13 05:55:05 <@!720891502108344360> how long is that ruler for the gun?
how long is a plot 💀
creations-chat 2021-10-13 06:00:11 ok so imma be generous and say thats a tracer and the actual bullet is a block long. if thats true, than the bullet moves at 50 blocks per 0.1 seconds, or 500 blocks per second. 
500 fps is 340 mph or mach .44 <:empty:794431705070174238>
creations-chat 2021-10-13 06:05:43 yeah bro this is a waste if time. its not even fun like what me an amperson were doing. 
gonna commit self toaster bath because bideo games math wrong <:nooo:787097964946259978>

also disregarding his advice is kinda stupid since he has literally some of the best planes in pcc
leave it be if you cant handle his criticism
creations-chat 2021-11-09 21:36:20 good constructive criticism isnt hate. if you seriously took that as him hating you have some issues bro
also <@!719168864705052802> you shouldnt use your skill level as a reason someone else should be better. especially considering your 10x better than them

creations-chat 2021-11-12 00:29:20 <@!749835829039464549> delete that shit from creations its disrespectful

also 👇

veterans day is for vets and active service members, memorial day is for all those who died to protect our country
creations-chat 2021-11-12 00:31:23 that doesnt take away from the fact that its disrespectful
maybe thats the reason there arent any others <:OkBuddy:652567204453154816>
creations-chat 2021-11-12 00:35:01 right but still delete the fucking "tomb"
none of the shit youre saying takes away from how fucking disrespectful it is to post such a shitty version of it.
creations-chat 2021-11-12 00:39:34 why are you being so shitty about it?
1: its the wrong holiday
2: its looks like shit and is extremely inaccurate
3: its extremely disrespectful to all those who died and couldnt be identified
if you respected the unknown soldiers at all youd remove it
creations-chat 2021-11-12 00:41:41 its not just a box, dumbass
<@!749835829039464549> it started that way then memorial day was created so now its just for veterans. you are extremely smart
creations-chat 2021-11-12 00:44:43 basically The Tomb of the Unknown Soldier is a monument constructed to honor all the American soldiers who died and could not be identified.

<@!749835829039464549> ok cool the build still fucking sucks and should be redone. until then its still incredibly disrespectful
<@!721103577380159490> yes.
creations-chat 2021-11-12 00:47:05 exactly, but it adds so much more insult when the build isnt even good. 
the fact that its a memorial for my fellow Americans sacrifice makes it highly offensive to me.
also
<@!749835829039464549> thank you for taking it down.
creations-chat 2021-11-12 00:49:28 Exactly.

creations-chat 2021-11-12 01:07:00 its pretty disrespectful. are we supposed to ignore those who died for our country just because we dont know who they are? no. hence the memorial. we have memorials for all service members known or unknown

creations-chat 2021-11-14 05:39:56 dude deserved it
creations-chat 2021-11-14 06:29:13 the front is quite good but the rest is just kinda, eh
creations-chat 2021-11-14 06:34:40 yeah i know the limitations of 3 block wide cars but you really could do better

the back is just, 🤢
no exhausts or license plate

the front could be better. the grill and vents are set too far back. also theres no wing (i just noticed jt but its way too small)

the sides are shit but thats pretty much unavoidable on 3wide cars. if i were you i would put fenders tho
creations-chat 2021-11-14 06:36:54 yes. if you can make that front you can make good fenders
also add side mirrors

the exhaust can just be circle/square emojis i forgor what shape they are

license plate is just a 1x1 sign 💀
or hell, a black square emoji would work
creations-chat 2021-11-14 06:41:27 car is p good imo, the pillars are ass
creations-chat 2021-11-14 06:43:42 because it will make a acceptable mini car into a incredible one
creations-chat 2021-11-14 06:45:54 make it thicker. its pretty large on the real car
also would you like to take this to dms? this slow mode is killing me

<@!498937968015441941> wasnt talking to you 🗿🗿
creations-chat 2021-11-14 06:49:12 piston lock another wing panel onto the bottom of it and use a medium black square emoji for the license plate
creations-chat 2021-11-14 06:51:14 damn you are lazy. why you gotta ruin a build with so much potential?
creations-chat 2021-11-14 06:54:30 hi this is my 3 wide ecto. i think i have some stance when it comes to mini cars

creations-chat 2021-11-14 08:43:07 it should be 150

<@!720751430595772418> nah ships was impossible to win for average plyers because boat builders are just…built extremely different

nolock was good because literally everyone could participate

also what awesomegamer said
creations-chat 2021-11-14 19:31:32 wing panels and evenly spaced prop engines

<@456226577798135808> the interior is just a bunch of motorlock and engines 💀 

<@!798181566370545744> builds dont need interiors but its not a waste of time since its just more detail
creations-chat 2021-11-14 19:34:07 fake rotors and a bunch of small prop engines on the inside 

<@!798181566370545744> maybe until you get better. post your builds here for tips and shit idk

<@!725358947904651335> why are you being so toxic bro what even happened? are you salty bc you didn't know what a pave hawk is or what
creations-chat 2021-11-14 19:36:55 its just e and q for thrust. the rotor doesnt provide lift

<@!725358947904651335> oh ok youre just an asshole understandable

<@456226577798135808> aight
creations-chat 2021-11-14 19:53:49 oh well thats 1 wide so its pretty much impossible to balance perfectly. but maybe try putting with panels in the wings. also its probably the torque from the rotor, soo offset the weight to negate that

if i do hide them, which i have before, the heli doesnt roll when i turn and it makes it feel really robotic and less responsive. cope

creations-chat 2021-11-22 00:19:27 yeah but why is it against the rules here? this server isnt roblox
with undes it makes sense since it can get the discord deleted, but shaders? its not like anything bad can happen from it. also it its against the roblox tos to use them then why is it so braindead easy to do so

im asking what obc's reason for it being against the discord rules is
creations-chat 2021-11-22 00:29:10 yes
creations-chat 2021-11-22 01:45:04 yeah thats a moment but weep doesnt copy

creations-chat 2021-11-28 08:50:46 i dont consider singular experts high status. high rank, yes, status, no. mainly because pretty new players can get experts but still not be respected like experienced ones.
creations-chat 2021-11-28 08:54:49 i feel like the respect comes from the player themself, not just the rank. like how you can be the most loved TF2 streamer ever and not have every achievement

creations-chat 2021-11-30 04:58:15 im just gonna assume thats what this guy means because asking him is going nowhere 

unless,

<@738064035135750224> by bent inward, do you mean the airflow restriction function of the intake? where it swivels up and down?
creations-chat 2021-11-30 05:01:37 oh so like how the f-14 intakes look?

also you said freaking omfg om you need anger management you hot head idiot kid smdhrnsj!!!1!1!1

creations-chat 2021-11-30 06:52:08 its a custom jet, not some fictional type of aircraft. jet engines need air. if it was a custom rocket plane, it wouldnt matter
creations-chat 2021-11-30 06:54:50 yes but they dont need intakes like jet engines do.

<@!765318482753224704> that sounds exactly like something someone who sucks at realism would say
creations-chat 2021-11-30 06:57:01 rocket engines use pure fuel burning for thrust, jet engines mix air with fuel and burn

creations-chat 2021-11-30 07:01:22 a fictional jet that looks like it literally wouldnt be able to function if it were real looks bad and extremely weird
creations-chat 2021-11-30 07:06:14 <@!765318482753224704> a build can be good and unrealistic (space cruisers, sci-fi vehicles, etc.) but the reason that jet is getting shit on is because its custom. when a build is a custom design, every design element is perceived as intentional. thus, the dude intentionally neglected to put intakes on it, making it either not a jet, or one that couldnt fly

<@456226577798135808> your ship fucking sucks, crying about how you were trying to be creative isnt going to fix that and makes you look like an annoying little kid. cope
creations-chat 2021-12-03 21:52:27 <@431881268775616513>  the roof rack, fins, and windows <:empty:794431705070174238>
creations-chat 2021-12-03 21:54:46 also the symbols <:nooo:787097964946259978> 

you couldve done way better
creations-chat 2021-12-03 21:59:07 cylinders are way too big for the canisters, use sparklers

motorlock the fins downwards

🚫 would look better for the logos, you could even motorlock a 👻 into it

more side detail

the rear wheels are clipping and dont even have rims

front light bar is floating

light bars could be better in general, the gray is too wide

the rear window framing is too wide

the gray things on the back need to be motorlocked downwards along with the fins

thats all i can think of for now
creations-chat 2021-12-03 22:05:12 <@738064035135750224> your ecto looks pretty messy in a lot of places, also the front could be way better

rest is p goo <:OkayChamp:709084018485887096> 👍
creations-chat 2021-12-03 22:07:42 mainly the doors also random floating half balls

also the roof rack is too wide.

doors are too thin as well


ye my ecto is 3 wide so i couldnt do much, probably could improve the roof tbh
creations-chat 2021-12-03 22:09:51 also, the logos are too high and for some reason the doors dont have windows. fix all that stuff i mentioned you will have extra-pro ecto

the-dump 2021-12-09 18:59:14 oh so something that could fuck someone up mentally by watching
the-dump 2021-12-09 18:59:18 i see

creations-chat 2021-12-09 19:25:23 rope + suspension = mor precise piston with adjustable lengths.

that also extends way father than pistons
creations-chat 2021-12-09 19:34:50 i dont think you understand and tbh i dont know how to explain it more other than you dont have to despawn your entire build just to change the length
creations-chat 2021-12-09 20:11:26 its a more versatile piston that extends farther and has inbetween positions
creations-chat 2021-12-09 20:16:38 <:OkayChamp:709084018485887096>👍

creations-chat 2021-12-10 19:57:59 wtf is wrong with the cheeks
oh wait is it a PL?
creations-chat 2021-12-10 20:00:12 ok looks good but needs more detail on the hull and also make the bit where the cheek armor ends and meets the side composite more smooth

<@!683847069890510887> fuck you want
creations-chat 2021-12-10 20:02:53 ok and another thing, the fenders are too thin and the front plates are too wide. easy fix
creations-chat 2021-12-10 20:06:41 actually the whole tank looks like it has a messed up aspect ratio. hull needs to be wider, turret too. i would just widen the side composite on the turret by a half block on each side, then widen the hull by 1 block. also the mantlet is too thin and the cutout for the sights is too wide.
creations-chat 2021-12-10 20:16:05 helo har, can i have some feedback on this rear window and front (so far) for my ecto?

creations-chat 2021-12-12 20:42:02 yeah tbh i understand most of the reasons why he downvotes stuff, but a joystick controlled, 2 rotor, compact heli? whats wrong with it?
creations-chat 2021-12-12 20:49:29 imma be honest bro that a stupidass reason. thats like downvoting a complex suspension car because it’s impractical. stuff like this are tests/showcases of skill and mechanical knowledge in the game
creations-chat 2021-12-12 20:52:15 he will simply make his plot bigger

creations-chat 2021-12-12 21:08:55 ok so what youre saying is he isnt allowed to think other builds are bad because he has a shitty build that he recently posted? ok. well in case you didnt know: https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/627195143040139264/848540497743183892

creations-chat 2021-12-12 21:59:30 when talking about a video game, where you build stuff, your builds most certainly show your skill level. also i do give feedback but only to people who arent irreversibly bad like you <:FineTroll:626841259746656289>
creations-chat 2021-12-12 22:02:00 i agree putting effort into builds is a good thing, but when they suck, they suck. 
im not going to treat everyone like a toddler and tell them that their piece of shit thing is so cool and pin it on the fridge.

<@456226577798135808> nah looks nice. i like the honorary livery

creations-chat 2021-12-12 22:06:47 <@588668543415877662> i recommend watching some tips and tricks videos as well as just playing the game more if you want to get better. you definitely have some potential
creations-chat 2021-12-12 22:08:49 1: i dont think you know what a light year is
2: you happy?

<@!587459840255983616> you know what, fuck it. imma drop the piece of shit persona and actually start being nice like how i was before. its too stressful to constantly be an asshole.

creations-chat 2021-12-13 09:01:29 the horizontals arent angled, the cockpit sucks, wings are too far back and the wrong shape, the text is raised and lumpy for some reason, and there isnt even a bottom vertical stabilizer.
creations-chat 2021-12-13 09:03:39 i know. im pretty sure the dude completely forgot about it. either that or the angle of the picture sucks

creations-chat 2021-12-13 09:10:36 too thin. also, <@!387022912286228480> a catapult would be cool and give the ability to add more detail since you dont have to worry about conventional take off

creations-chat 2021-12-13 17:50:34 not really at all. with all the shite creations lately, 100 upvotes is about the same as 75-85 a few months ago. people are just really relieved to see good builds. also the dc-10 is pretty good

creations-chat 2021-12-14 06:41:37 i saw all the talented builders and immediately got pissed that i was bad and there were so many people that were better than me and decided to go from shitty 25 block planes to stuff like my t-72 and ecto.

i didnt care about the douchebags, i only cared about thinning out the percentage of people who were better than me 😎

creations-chat 2021-12-15 05:27:45 robloxians are 5 studs tall and 5.5 feet tall. a stud is just barely under 1 foot in length. sps nearly directly translates to fps
creations-chat 2021-12-15 05:30:11 also your math is hella wrong. all you did was multiply a stud length (0.28 METERS) by the sps and called it miles per hour even tho thats meters per second. 297 meters per second is 664.37 mph.
creations-chat 2021-12-15 05:32:33 1 stud = 11 inches. just use fps and youre pretty much right

yours is just, really bad
creations-chat 2021-12-15 23:08:54 originally i was going to give you tips but since youre acting like an overly sensitive child, my only response is:
Why u gotta be so bad?
creations-chat 2021-12-15 23:11:44 all i said was its bad (which it very much is) and you immediately said that i hate you and im toxic. that really seems like your problem
creations-chat 2021-12-15 23:14:58 "what? im bad at the game and have been told so? not my problem, everyone else is a toxic asshole who hates new players"

creations-chat 2021-12-23 04:18:18 its, realistic. tanks carry spare parts. 
also tanks are literally supposed to be detailed. 

also, designer 4 💀
creations-chat 2021-12-23 04:20:37 that’s literally 1 roadwheel. wdym “that many”
whats with all the low ranks crying about it being detailed
creations-chat 2021-12-23 04:24:24 smooth tanks just simply look bad.

<@!798957190399524865> low rank = skill issue/low experience/both
and yes theres such thing as overdetailing, on planes. you seriously cant over detail a tank because i guarantee theres an armor package that looks like it
creations-chat 2021-12-23 04:26:49 thats cause it’s usually inside the tank/on the turret. but my interior is already cramped and tbh bare sides look ugly
creations-chat 2021-12-23 04:30:01 wait, you build planes, of course you dont want extra detail lmao
creations-chat 2021-12-23 04:32:38 all the detail with planes is in the shaping
for tanks its in equipment and accessories + interior 

<@456226577798135808> yeah but its dumb criticism ngl
creations-chat 2021-12-23 04:35:02 exactly. 

<@456226577798135808> so why dont you build a tank with no detail and see how shit it looks <:KEKW:670310537300672528>

creations-chat 2021-12-26 00:17:26 State trooper pulled me over after he tagged me going 115 mph past the weigh station as I was hauling 12,000 lbs of steel beams. I roll down the window & he asks me, "Sir, is this the Dodge Ram that won 4 JD Power & Associate awards and is 2019s motor trend truck of the year!?" I said, "Yes sir, plus it also has a 5 star safety rating & is the most fuel efficient truck in America." He let me off the hook & immediately sped off to his local Dodge dealer to buy a Dodge Ram during RAM TRUCK MONTH so he could get $1,000 cash back! #BlueLivesMatter

creations-chat 2021-12-30 09:07:27 hello the_mechanic2001
creations-chat 2021-12-30 09:10:57 what do you think?
creations-chat 2021-12-30 09:13:09 yeah ik but i cant really make it hof level when its roscale and boxnes's is like 7 wide

<@!757887014388367401> thank :D
also yeah it do kinda look like the brickmania humvee. weird
creations-chat 2021-12-30 09:18:16 every humvee looks the same but ngl i think mine is one of the better ones and certainly better than quackers. correct me if im wrong
creations-chat 2021-12-30 09:37:33 well its roscale so its pretty small also face the wall
creations-chat 2021-12-30 09:45:47 humvees are like 2.4 blocks tall and mine is like 2.52 💀 not counting the turret
creations-chat 2021-12-30 09:54:29 nah imma add a manned turret like on the m1151
creations-chat 2021-12-30 10:01:39 both, smarty
creations-chat 2021-12-30 10:03:41 idfk why u asking me. i build ground vehicles so i know nothing about how good planes are
creations-chat 2021-12-30 11:24:07 <@!719168864705052802> i assume you downvoted because the hood isnt angled and theres not enough paint variation?
creations-chat 2021-12-30 11:28:34 nope. theres a glitch you can do to keep it toggled <:FineTroll:626841259746656289>
creations-chat 2021-12-30 11:30:57 dont even have to get out of the seat <:trollface:775024642104229898>

creations-chat 2021-12-30 11:41:30 ok cool dont care

<@!707953054489509978> nah bruh its even more simple than that. it seriously takes 1 click
creations-chat 2021-12-30 11:51:31 <:m_:778994206948589638> 
ooookaay. its 3 wide its not going to have ever single bolt and scratch. besides it needs to be able to carry 4 people because the 14th has so many members and not all of em have completed vehicles yet
creations-chat 2021-12-30 11:56:46 hmm i see what could i add?
creations-chat 2021-12-30 12:03:42 use the m1151 since its the one its most heavily based on
creations-chat 2021-12-30 12:32:51 hi you good?
creations-chat 2021-12-30 12:36:39 oh np and thanks
creations-chat 2021-12-30 12:46:41 ok so i can explain half of these things

1: on a reference inage i have all the mirrors are grey which i personally find less bland than just alllll tan (image 1)

2: the bumper is on it its just hard to see because its black which is realistically colored (image 3)

3: that “exposed motor” is a sparkler which is supposed to represent the thing in image 2 but it was either too tall or too short without a piston lock that would be visible inside the wheel well

4: the orange lights are as good as possible without a shit ton of piston locking.

5: the “grill” is a brush guard but ig i can remove it

6: the windows on the mantlet is overly difficult simply due to limited space but ill see what i can do.

rest is good advice thank you

ngl i kinda forgot a lot of stuff now that i think about it oops

creations-chat 2021-12-31 10:57:37 yeah but the difference is usually its new/different builds that have the 14th markings as apposed to the exact same thing over and over
creations-chat 2021-12-31 11:01:21 its the build and then a plane crazy remake of this. 🧠 

https://youtu.be/Qe1Evnwu_Wo
creations-chat 2021-12-31 11:04:55 yeah but heres the thing. like i said the video is a meme not a showcase of the build unlike the first post so you cant really say its a blatant repost lol. i understand where youre coming from tho.
creations-chat 2021-12-31 11:06:58 bruh are you not reading my messages or smth? maybe watch the fucking video and youll see why your argument sucks

creations-chat 2022-01-01 14:22:48 its very rare to find a unpainted military vehicle used by police. even then the paint color is really wrong which is something you definitely can “control” unlike your skill. 
oh and about that, you can control your skill level.
creations-chat 2022-01-01 14:25:00 skill up: play the game more, watch tips and tricks videos, get feedback on build
skill down: take a long enough break to forget all that
creations-chat 2022-01-01 14:27:46 i only skill up after taking breaks due to burnout (i get burnt out after literally every build i make)

creations-chat 2022-01-01 15:19:20 also before you mention it, <@!719168864705052802> angling the hood is impossible while still having the same amount of detail, and since the angle is so slight on the humvee i personally dont think it matters

creations-chat 2022-01-01 15:28:10 oversized sized cars that are oversized and big

creations-chat 2022-01-02 10:16:30 yea thats like 1.3:1 ish cause the m60 is 4 tall and 5 wide

creations-chat 2022-01-02 10:33:58 😭 man just fix it
creations-chat 2022-01-02 10:36:19 turret is too tall and ngl pretty ugly from the side. also the tracks are too tall. also how wide is it?
creations-chat 2022-01-02 10:39:23 oof. 1:1 patton is 5 wide. might just have to completely remake
creations-chat 2022-01-02 10:41:33 💀
i think its fine ngl. 7 wide is still pretty small
creations-chat 2022-01-02 10:44:18 most of the tanks in 14th that arent custom are like 1.1:1 (due to the uncontrollable limitations of plane crazy)
my humvee before the m1151 mod was exactly 1:1 but idk the scale now.

creations-chat 2022-01-02 14:04:04 hi roscale humvee expert here, cab is actually good its just the windshield is missing the framing in the middle

i like the version you did tho with the half cab pickup as apposed to the sloped back just being removed. maybe make it a stinger humvee or smth idk
creations-chat 2022-01-02 14:07:27 roscale muscle car coming soon (idk when i get burned out after every build)

creations-chat 2022-01-02 14:48:19 a good color i like to use is 165, 125, 90 (i think. might wanna turn down the red)
also ngl that hood is kinda ass you should add more 3d detail to it. and the framing in the middle of the windshield. i like the stinger pods tho 👍
also the roof makes it look like a type 93 <:trollface:775024642104229898>

creations-chat 2022-01-10 13:23:47 💀💀
creations-chat 2022-01-10 13:29:27 blueprints arent everything <:empty:794431705070174238>
there are multiple things you need to get right
detail
shaping
paint
sometimes size but thats rare
creations-chat 2022-01-10 13:31:34 blueprints dont show fine detail and paint accuracy also your overlays are rarely accurate iirc (could be wrong)

also blueprint overlays are really only effective on planes
creations-chat 2022-01-10 13:34:15 hence why its bad to use as your only feedback tool 💀
creations-chat 2022-01-10 13:37:17 yeah not trynna sound mean but if you dont care about detail, thats why most of your builds look mediocre. detail is just as important as proportions
creations-chat 2022-01-10 13:41:39 if your plane looks good on the inside, that doesnt mean it automatically looks good on the outside
creations-chat 2022-01-10 13:44:55 why
its not hard just tedious. motorlock delta wing panels inside themselves for the wing camo, use singular motorlocks for the fuselage, then paint the angled parts that would be too hard to put camo on
creations-chat 2022-01-10 13:47:15 1: guh just look at pictures

 this has been established multiple times
creations-chat 2022-01-17 07:34:34 why is everyone with the easiest/least skill required expert ranks attacking the non expert who speaks facts
creations-chat 2022-01-17 07:36:59 expert designer which most of the time doesnt require a whole lot of skill <:FineTroll:626841259746656289> 

<@!799335319945085018> yes it is. some of the shittiest builds ever get upvoted if its big and not painted badly. also whyd you bring up vtols, you dont have expert vtol 💀
same with terrain
creations-chat 2022-01-17 07:41:03 expert designer is usually luck but once you get good you can consistently get over 90 upvotes
most people dont get consistently good until after they get expert designer tho 🗿
creations-chat 2022-01-17 07:43:27 p much
shipwright and terrain are basically considered low ranks since theyre almost always so easy
creations-chat 2022-01-17 07:45:37 yes but my skill level (with ground vehicles) is decently known so idc 🗿

<@!711009848438947850> 1: it takes place in Hazzard County, Georgia
2: already has the horn. hell its had the horn since before i painted it orange
3: no glass, too hard and looks bad

(it also plays the theme and the general lee by johnny cash)

creations-chat 2022-01-17 21:17:13 yeah but how does this help me make it in plane crazy
creations-chat 2022-01-17 21:20:43 i think i have  an idea but it will be extremely difficult and also look like shit cause of the flags dimmensions (2.2x2.5)
creations-chat 2022-01-17 21:30:49 no glass looks like shit, i will add lynynrd skynyrd tho
creations-chat 2022-01-17 22:36:05 nope

creations-chat 2022-01-17 22:54:57 💀
creations-chat 2022-01-17 22:57:23 so, either have a giant black strip the width of the car, or a tiny bit of orange on the wheel 
imma go with the least noticeable one

<@!791976765123592233> if only it was on the actual general lee

<@456226577798135808> fixed expos motr
creations-chat 2022-01-17 23:18:16 ok
creations-chat 2022-01-17 23:30:03 its possible but heres the issue, for me at least
it makes it more identifiable as a charger, and it hides some exposed motors, pistons, and gaps
also when i do make it smaller, it has a gap since i need to use angled disconnectors. piston locking wont work cause it will be extremely exposed

creations-chat 2022-02-02 02:24:47 lol no
with a bigger scale you can fit detail and other general shaping a lot easier, with smaller scale it gets much harder due to the extremely limited space, requiring lots of motor and piston lock
creations-chat 2022-02-02 02:27:01 ^^^
creations-chat 2022-02-02 02:29:22 well duh if you make a cardboard box is easy on both scales
but yeah in general id say both are equal effort wise

hars has incredibly high standards, which is allowed
votes arent biased unless you say the better you get, the more critical you get and therefore biased. no one here thinks "oh hes knew lets be nice" its more like "hes bad and new, L" or "hes good and new wow"

creations-chat 2022-02-03 21:42:52 gas lighting? why the hell would i do that? seems like you’re trying to push the blame off on me. and its not MY FAULT that you bought that piece of shit lot and tried to turn it into a “trendy” fidget toy store. how could you be so stupid to try and make a buisness in the tail end of a fucking tiktok trend? if you had any basic knowledge about starting a buisness you would know that trying to capitalize on a fad is nothing but a ticket to poverty

creations-chat 2022-02-10 04:00:46 you want me to add a barely noticeable curve to a 3 block wide build 💀 
you do realize that would require a severe decrease in detail and need an absolute shit ton of pistons right?
not even fabricio or JasonVoorhees8319 (imo the 2 best 3 wide car builders) could pull that off

creations-chat 2022-02-11 06:05:50 i feel dat
rn the only downvote on my quattro is from an aero rank 2 with the reason that its too small to fit enough detail
man even wants me to put the slight like 2 degree curve on the front 🗿
creations-chat 2022-02-11 06:08:27 the second on fr just doesnt exist. people who build like that and that much are always really supportive. and dont mention hars because hes way under his own standards
creations-chat 2022-02-11 06:10:29 thats not how i think at all
if someone has actual criticism that i can use to make my builds excellent i want to hear it. 
besides i have a bit of an inferiority complex so i dont like any of my builds <:OkayChamp:709084018485887096> 👍

creations-chat 2022-02-12 10:04:05 ok i agree the first part you mentioned is bad but the hood isnt worth the trouble. my quattro has the angle and it took up almost all the build time to get to work right so i could keep all the detail of a normal flat hood and the angle was barely noticeable in the photos. also that would leave a shit ton of exposed motors and pistons.

im going to explode
creations-chat 2022-02-18 11:41:02 gimme a top view ill do an overlay
also what varient is it
creations-chat 2022-02-18 11:47:53 im just gonna assume it a 104c
creations-chat 2022-02-18 11:50:14 yeah its really bad ngl. i feel like it doesnt require a remake tho.
only issues are the intake length, overall length, wings, and the thickness of the engine area
also the intakes shouldnt angle in like that. they have a pretty sharp cutoff
creations-chat 2022-02-18 11:53:45 everything up until the intakes is fine bro just fix what doesnt line up. keep the fuselage and fix the other stuff
creations-chat 2022-02-18 11:56:30 nose is fine simply due to limitations, intakes really could be better, even if extended 0.5 but whatever. and how can you not fix the engine width?
creations-chat 2022-02-18 11:58:58 bro. finish it. even in this super disproportionate state its in its still one of the best 104s ive seen. i dont wanna see it abandoned
creations-chat 2022-02-18 12:01:41 yes do

creations-chat 2022-02-25 19:25:40 i know what the tb3 is
yours just has no resemblance
well besides the very front
creations-chat 2022-02-25 19:27:44 ok so is it a fucking tb3 or something based on a tb3 make up your mind before crying about people now knowing what it is
also i admit the wings are fine that just looked weird from the first angle

BATTLE OF THE SKILL ISSUE HAVERS
creations-chat 2022-06-23 07:36:11 he pinged the wrong dude its ok
creations-chat 2022-06-23 07:40:06 how did pcc completely reverse in the time i was banned. went from new players getting bullied by no lifes to new players bullying more new players without a good builder in sight
creations-chat 2022-06-23 07:42:09 the proportions are dogshit and its missing a lot of stuff like an island
creations-chat 2022-06-23 07:45:44 what is that (if you say f-5 i will cry) 

<@849139320106516491> just because its custom doesnt mean it gets a free pass on looking bad. its way too short and because its wip you should be taking advice, not rejecting it

“oh shit ive gone too deep time to try and play it off like a joke haha”
creations-chat 2022-06-23 07:49:02 the pyramid wedge 😭

<@849139320106516491> i already said its too short which is advice. also adding “stuff” means detail which is mb but still. do it
creations-chat 2022-06-23 07:51:10 yeah replace the pyramid wedge by continuing the nose angle downwards 
dont do just 2 half wedges like a lot of people
creations-chat 2022-06-23 07:53:14 you never made a joke 💀
you made a legitimate statement that you realized was dumb and then said it was a joke minutes later after beinng called out for it
creations-chat 2022-06-23 07:55:32 yeah do a compact torp boat that can barely hold 2 torpedoes
creations-chat 2022-06-23 08:00:36 you said “mfs on their way to post bad builds in creations” or something like that and then angel called you out for also being bad and saying that then you argued for a few minutes and gave up and said it was a joke and that angel is in the wrong for “not having a sense of humor”
creations-chat 2022-06-23 08:03:14 his perception is warped by his ego considering he didnt see anything wrong with his carrier 💀

<@456226577798135808> ok father
creations-chat 2022-06-24 04:12:50 i know you like pop culture cars so a ‘77 trans am would be cool cause you can not only do Ban One, but with slight modifcations you could also make K.I.T.T.

on top of that its a mega sexy car
creations-chat 2022-06-24 04:15:50 how about a sort of wager: if the elvis movie sucks (which i doubt), do kitt first

creations-chat 2022-06-24 07:31:11 yeah its roscale because the roblox man is actually a video game character that doesn’t physically exist and therefore cannot be scaled to due to the lack of real measurements (for both considering peter griffin is a drawing) and proportions so technically the two can be any size in relation to eachother and still be considered roscale

creations-chat 2022-06-29 19:28:14 use blueprints not real images 💀
creations-chat 2022-06-29 19:44:05 even worse
the reason you use blueprints is because they arent affected by fov like real photos and 3d models
this is why your f-16 is ass rn
creations-chat 2022-06-29 20:06:50 yes but using an overlay thats also affected by fov makes it worse
creations-chat 2022-06-29 20:31:07 both suck but that one sucks less
creations-chat 2022-06-29 20:33:14 no, people get it. its just the build is so ass no one cares

creations-chat 2022-06-29 22:18:15 at least try, man
creations-chat 2022-06-29 22:24:19 1: make it blue (makes it more recognizable)
2: add smaller details like japanese text and insignias
3: make the stinger pods not dogshit
4: add the cage armor on the bed
5: add doors or smth to mimic the doors
6: make the windshield completely vertical
creations-chat 2022-06-29 22:43:05 <@698587744842022983> what is that

creations-chat 2022-06-30 07:07:19 
creations-chat 2022-06-30 07:36:18 yeah its ace combat
creations-chat 2022-06-30 07:39:35 it just looks horrible. absolutely no resemblance.
my advice is just play the game more and watch guides and shit. in time youll get better.
the fact you openly asked for feedback indicates a healthy mindset towards criticism which will take you and your skill level to new heights. just stick with it man
creations-chat 2022-06-30 07:43:03 also your best friends for making planes is motor and camera lock. learn those two skills.
creations-chat 2022-06-30 07:46:22 theres not really such thing as too little motorlock. imo the issue is improper use which is why i suggested to develop the skill more

<@723940197456281640> make me

creations-chat 2022-07-01 05:54:11 same. rbk is directly responsible for the gigantic drop in quality as he cracked down on toxicity, allowing braindead whitenames to flourish and kill the server
creations-chat 2022-07-01 05:56:59 it wont help. this server is past he point of no return. i miss when everyone knew everyone else and there were like 150 active people at most but now all the cool people are gone for various reasons and this has become a child hangout

creations-chat 2022-07-03 19:10:13 honestly i think the fact there are 15 amazing 2 wide planes for every 1 good 1 wide shows how much harder it is. noobies just cant handle the lazy style
creations-chat 2022-07-03 19:13:12 if being easier makes it superior then ok <:clueless:942802644043464734>

creations-chat 2022-07-03 19:19:43 i thought you meant the car and i was like wtf
creations-chat 2022-07-03 19:21:45 yeah it gets wider but the initial part of the nose is 1 wide.
a proper roscale f-16 will transition from 1 wide to 2

creations-chat 2022-07-05 07:25:02 actually the supra kinda sucks (when stock, assuming its not a turbo trim). its legendary status comes from how easy the 2jz is to tune. there are 1200+ hp supras out there

creations-chat 2022-07-05 07:44:40 oh wait you mean the mk5

also how is the mk5 not international? its a japanese car with mostly german components  thats sold in 11+ countries
creations-chat 2022-07-05 07:46:48 also comparing the supra to the a hellcat (i assume you mean challenger the hellcat) is like comparing apples and oranges. the supra is track oriented while the challenger hellcat (like all american cars) is for the qm

creations-chat 2022-07-09 03:13:34 it helps by alerting you to the issues. its not hard to figure how to fix problems, the difficulty is spotting them on your own builds due to bias
creations-chat 2022-07-09 03:15:36 quit victimizing yourself and get better
no one gives a shit abt "hard work" if it doesnt pay off. in both the real world and pcc
creations-chat 2022-07-09 03:18:07 THEN LEARN
google, reddit, youtube, and <#478584971670454284> exist <:BIG2:588443778554134540>

and yes you are victimizing yourself by saying "waah im made to feel like i suck waaah this community is so bad"
creations-chat 2022-07-09 03:21:04 this channel is shit*
creations-chat 2022-07-09 03:24:11 use more text, dont rely on cam locking so much, and fix your mindset
also watch guides and whatnot
creations-chat 2022-07-09 03:38:32 figure it out
creations-chat 2022-07-09 03:52:45 bc you blatantly copied boxness at least fix the issues with his build
creations-chat 2022-07-09 03:55:21 also fix the front wheel wells being anorexic
creations-chat 2022-07-09 03:58:53 fix the front wheel ***wells***

creations-chat 2022-07-09 04:01:09 might be the quality but it doesnt look like it
creations-chat 2022-07-09 04:07:59 this part
i cant see yours cause of the quality

<@564463541248065547> it sucks. lying doesnt help just as much as toxicity
creations-chat 2022-07-09 04:10:13 people can have their own opinions and voice them 
thats the entire point of this channel, jackass
creations-chat 2022-07-09 04:12:29 bro this is discord not kindergarten no one gives a fuck about other peoples feelings. especially not whiney childrens

"WAAH THIS PERSON SAID I WAS BAD ON THE INTERNET WAAAAAH WAAAAAH"
creations-chat 2022-07-09 04:14:36 <@564463541248065547> take notes on this guy getting shit on
he doesnt cry and whine abt it
creations-chat 2022-07-09 04:16:38 yes you certainly do. youre second hand crying for the dude with the dogshit forklift
quit acting like peoples mom its weird. this isnt a playground
creations-chat 2022-07-09 04:18:58 thats kinda contradictory since you just said you dont play the game much

<@523003901075521536> exactly. we dont caudle feelings. 
<@564463541248065547> if you have a problem with no one babying the shitty noobs, leave. you bitching wont change it
and i did give him helpful feedback you just cant read
creations-chat 2022-07-09 04:21:17 its not that hard to understand that "use more text" means use it as detail and instead of cameras 
he understood
you being a noob also doesnt help. dont give feedback if you suck too
creations-chat 2022-07-09 04:23:47 youre treating him like a toddler. 
also no ones going to improve if the person helping is just as shit or worse than them
creations-chat 2022-07-09 04:27:08 one of the best, if not the best skill to learn in life is how to cope. you cant live if you let literally ever smidge of negativity destroy your mood. now please shut the fuck up

also how the fuck is me saying his virtual forklift looks bad equivalent to starving him, shooting his children in front of him, and beating him half to death. that comparison is straight up disrespectful to the hundreds of thousands of real north koreans who are tortured to death by their own totalitarian government. please leave this server literally no one at all wants you and your horrible opinions here

but nowhere near innactive or insignificant considering what ive been involved with in this community (specifically revolutionizing roscale cars, and re-popularizing mini builds in general)
if you arent in the loop, dont make comments on it please

make it green or use 128, 114, 98
also use a sparkler for the snorkel
creations-chat 2022-07-10 02:35:51 incredibly based humvee schemes
creations-chat 2022-07-10 02:38:00 humvees come from the factory green 💀
creations-chat 2022-07-10 02:40:03 whoda thunked that green is used for green environments and tan is used for tan environments
creations-chat 2022-07-10 02:43:26 m1151 (my favorite humvee variant) plus 3 tone CARC (my favorite camouflage scheme) = 😍
creations-chat 2022-07-10 02:45:57 1: its not racist to call tan skin color since white people exist
2: its still gay. its called tan 😡
creations-chat 2022-07-10 02:50:35 melon??? 

<@750066581874147389> actually yes
<@706717603258957864> base humvees are all made at one plant then go to rebuild facilities and whatnot for upgrade kits and whatever else
creations-chat 2022-07-10 02:52:42 haha funny 🗿
creations-chat 2022-07-10 02:55:52 technically that humvee is forest green, desaturated reddish brown, and black get it right idiot fartbrain
creations-chat 2022-07-10 02:57:59 ask tinon he knows im 12
creations-chat 2022-07-10 03:00:58 also the top humvee is an m1151a1 while the bottom is a normal m1151
creations-chat 2022-07-10 03:03:11 i know quite a few humvee facts and features
creations-chat 2022-07-10 03:07:15 yknow you could just call the bottom ones scheme NATO three tone camouflage CARC right?
creations-chat 2022-07-10 03:12:57 also it appears the bottom one has smoke launchers and an extended snorkel
creations-chat 2022-07-10 03:24:45 thats part of the a1 package which was already mentioned and the tires are the same.
creations-chat 2022-07-10 03:26:59 yeah also this is the most accurate and simple one https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/504436696021204992/995528738685067274/20220709_221352.jpg

also how do you not know what a tie-down strap is 💀
creations-chat 2022-07-10 03:29:22 a tie down strap is a basic thing. its not specific to cars
creations-chat 2022-07-10 03:31:42 oh :(
creations-chat 2022-07-10 04:50:55 <@821642310491570196> you can post copied builds also the front wheel wells suck
creations-chat 2022-07-10 04:54:05 they look big but not huge. proper roscale a-10s are like 1.5 wide 
(obv 1.5+ rounds up to 2)

creations-chat 2022-07-10 05:02:40 <@821642310491570196> been looking at the humvee more and the coloring is ass. the paint is too bright and certain parts are the wrong color in general
also the grill is abysmal
and finally its missing quite a bit of detail while also having inaccurate ones (like the turret ring on the roof despite the lack of a turret or any form of weapon)

creations-chat 2022-07-10 11:25:28 <@456226577798135808> really no other words to describe your steve other than lazy or lame

it doesnt move, theres none of the color variation or shading like on actual minecraft models, and its also minecraft so its just a bunch of prisms (no skill involved when making a rectangle)

there are just way, way better minecraft builds out there (mostly by frogman):

https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/758545164532056084/932637608301985802/unknown.png
(not to mention the f-16 is one wide irl)
creations-chat 2022-07-10 23:45:09 yes

obv it gets wider but the initial part of the nose is 1 wide. if you say it isnt you are fr lying
creations-chat 2022-07-10 23:47:31 "hurrr dur i hate mini planes because uhh hurr durr idk boxne said so!!"
creations-chat 2022-07-10 23:51:39 the majority think it looks bad because theyre either sucking up to a community figure or only care about the shitty public server builds or just dont understand how measurements, or different build genres work. obv everyone has an opinion, but dont shit on things you dont understand (also jets vary in size heavily  so some are 1 wide, some are 2, whatever) but quite a few fighters are 1 wide
creations-chat 2022-07-10 23:54:24 bad 1 wides*
on good ones you need to not only put disconnectors on the side but use a cylinder cockpit in order for the dimensions to not be goofy

creations-chat 2022-07-15 05:06:16 the issue with the 1x3 is that its not round like on the real lerx. the 1x4 will look wonky if i move it forward since the problem is the angle of it and not where it starts

creations-chat 2022-07-18 07:05:52 damn
creations-chat 2022-07-18 07:30:12 no
creations-chat 2022-07-18 07:33:35 paint sucks, engines are way too big, the winglets suck (exposed motor), fuselage is stubby, the horizontal stabilizers are fucking awful, and the nose is too sharp.
creations-chat 2022-07-18 07:38:01 shading, use motorlock for more painted details (specifically on the letters)

make the stabilizers not super sharp and thin (they may be fine but the angle of the photos doesnt show them)
creations-chat 2022-07-18 07:40:04 nvm
rework the entire plane and learn advanced motorlock
creations-chat 2022-07-18 07:48:07 good that shit fucking sucks
creations-chat 2022-07-18 07:50:32 what the fuck do 2 other peoples opinions have to do with mine

creations-chat 2022-07-20 18:58:06 the iron cross is way older than than imperial germany  has less to do with the ww2 germans than the windmill (which is a hindu symbol anyway) 

boom nuff said
creations-chat 2022-07-20 19:00:12 saying the iron cross is bad or offensive is just a stupid as saying the st george ribbon is
creations-chat 2022-07-20 19:05:15 thats 💀

but i think the point theyre trying to make is that you should be blaming the high command not the (essentially) slave foot soldiers that did the dirty work under the implication that if they didnt they and their families would be executed or put in a camp 

thats not saying there werent supporters in the lower ranks but you do have to remember that the first people the party had to conquer were the germans themselves 

the other people are just horrible at arguing or even having discussions in general. ok im leaving before a mod murders us

<@685909594932773033> yes i know how they work im not a 12 year old who thinks hes smart cause he can identify famous cars <:clueless:942802644043464734>
creations-chat 2022-07-21 20:05:48 bughatti is overrated too
koen is the only car brand out of the 4 that deserves the praise

also ferarri is ass they sue you if you modify your car that you BOUGHT from them

lambo is just kinda lame they stopped being cool after the 2000s
creations-chat 2022-07-21 20:08:50 bughattis are fat and ugly and rely way too heavily on power since they focus more on luxury, which if fine but then they say their cars are super fast and dont really acknowledge the fact that the cars LITERALLY EXPLODE after going full speed for 5 minutes.

also n00bmaster is here, everyone leave for he is a bad omen
creations-chat 2022-07-21 20:11:28 there are test tracks (especially in the desert area of the US) that are many miles long

<@456226577798135808> yeah but i still think its way less impressive that your car can go 300+ if it cant hold it without exploding. thats why le mans is awesome because the cars need to be fast as shit but last 24 hours straight with minimal breaks
creations-chat 2022-07-21 20:14:29 your mom

<@456226577798135808> simply make tires that cant explode then. they sell cars that cost $2m they can afford to make good tires also yeah i wasnt specific le mans sucks now but it used to be way faster and cooler
creations-chat 2022-07-21 20:18:11 please use punctuation i fr cannot follow you

<@456226577798135808> maybe if the cars didnt weigh more than a dodge challenger they wouldnt need to worry so much abt adding more durable tires
thats what im trynna say. bughattis are fat and gay and if they put their awesome engines in something lighter it would be cool

the-dump 2022-07-25 10:45:50 ok cool so can i make a suggestion for the accuracy of the guns?
the-dump 2022-07-25 10:46:33 specifically the “auto rifle”
the-dump 2022-07-25 18:20:05 1: thats a mp34 which is an smg not a rifle
2: when youre out of ammo there shouldnt be repeating clicks like that, just 1 since its an open bolt system meaning the bolt stays back until the trigger is pulled and then is reset by the recoil, which is impossible without a round in the chamber
2: the rate of fire should be a little slower

creations-chat 2022-07-27 05:20:14 airliner builders try not to be incredibly average challenge (impossible)

yes. which is why i was prompted to write that diss
creations-chat 2022-07-27 05:24:26 make the engines round with custom angles, rely less of wedges for everything, add a livery, and add more detail in general
creations-chat 2022-07-27 05:27:29 detail might come with the livery but i meant all the little panel lines and bits of text that are on some models

also add window frames

creations-chat 2022-07-27 05:53:45 well yeah id say my original diss is a little inaccurate for the sake of comedy

creations-chat 2022-07-27 18:31:27 rbk is too much of a boomer to know what custom angles or cameras are
creations-chat 2022-07-27 18:33:46 2 simple reasons for me:

1: they arent affected by bullshit pc lag and also get the same exact angle every time, even if they reset every time you load your build

2: its much lighter than motorlock since cameras weigh nothing and you usually only need some text as a connection

actually 3:
it allows you to have custom angles on builds that are too small to have motorlock
creations-chat 2022-07-27 18:41:12 no im pretty sure thats from a vine of a kid falling over

4: counter rotating rotors (skill issue)
5: fat as shit
6: tiny ass cockpit windows
7: looks like if an mi-6 and mi-24 had a kid and because they are related it was born deformed
8: no detail
9: missing exhausts
10: random ass gaps all over the place
11: the belly color is wrong
12: no point for it to be as big as it is
13: nose is fat too
14: goofy ass instruments 
15: no landing gear 
16: its russian 
17: looks like it has an identity crisis. cant decide if its an attack helicopter, transport, or heavy lifter
18: the rotors are tiny
19: 4 intakes 💀
20: goofy ass shaping

BONUSES <:clueless:942802644043464734> 

21: horrid thickness transitions 
22: over-reliance on wedges and other specialized blocks for shaping
23: desperately needs an angle locked tail

theres your 20 reasons.
in conclusion, it sucks just like i said <:clueless:942802644043464734>

creations-chat 2022-08-04 00:37:05 ok noted but a few of those reasons are mentioning things that ive only seen present on the bainbridge (like the brown rectangle and the thing its on) or are impossible to do due to scale or construction but ill certainly keep the valid reasons in mind thank you for the detailed criticism <:clueless:942802644043464734> 👍

creations-chat 2022-08-04 06:56:09 and your bus doesnt have an functionalily besides suspension blocks and motors connected to some cylinders so you cant use that as an excuse for sucking either

not to mention that functionality puts no limits on looks unless its a pvp build which that clearly isnt
creations-chat 2022-08-04 06:58:44 i did look and it has no mechanisms or anything even remotely worth mentioning besides how bad it is <:stuff:908917207986208828>
creations-chat 2022-08-04 07:01:28 wow you placed some motors holy shit thats so skillful and totally excuses the total neglect of the exterior. also you cant post a build made for functionality and then not show any of the functionality (not like there is any anyway) and expect people to strain their eyes looking for it instead of just looking at the most presented part of the build, the exterior.

creations-chat 2022-08-06 04:41:38 dont live in a city then its simple. live in a rural area thats less than 30 minutes from a city. that allows you to be close to a developed area without being depressed

like guh
creations-chat 2022-08-06 06:56:30 now i just have to channel all my mech experience (none) into making it not walk like it has cerebral palsy
creations-chat 2022-08-06 07:24:32 actively making it walk
creations-chat 2022-08-06 07:39:20 fart rank
creations-chat 2022-08-06 07:47:06 if you ask me, building a tutorial to learn a type of vehicle is possibly the best way to get good at the game when combined with watching guides on game mechanics. i could hook you up with what i consider the good ones and maybe general answer questions in dms if you need
creations-chat 2022-08-06 07:51:02 alr just dm which vehicle types you want. also i suggest customizing the tutorials as well
creations-chat 2022-08-06 07:56:50 looks good but the lerx sucks and the wings are too fat

creations-chat 2022-08-06 08:30:56 the nose to canopy transitions is horrendous
creations-chat 2022-08-06 08:33:23 its literally as simple as angle locking the top of the nose

try to make it like this https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/653340142014038065/1005393506283569192/IMG_8872.png
creations-chat 2022-08-06 08:36:02 and you not giving a shit is why it looks like ass. its a simple thing so it wont be too hard
creations-chat 2022-08-06 08:38:30 what
creations-chat 2022-08-06 08:40:39 shut up no ones talking to you

then close discord or go to another channel this server doesnt revolve around you
creations-chat 2022-08-06 08:42:50 its your build and it looks bad. you posted it in this channel meaning you wanted feedback and now youre crying that i gave you feedback. whats your problem
creations-chat 2022-08-06 08:46:55 then do that in <#384021699466756107> because this is the feedback channel. even then posting your build anywhere in this server is automatically saying youre open to feedback. besides its not like im completely altering the design im just suggesting you not make it look like…that. when making a custom plane you have to atleast base it on reality and yours is super goofy. the aerodynamics of the nose and canopy simply do not match or blend well making it look BAD and im trying to help you FIX that. do whatever but your tears arent going to make your plane any better.
creations-chat 2022-08-06 08:48:58 here ill shorten it
youre a dumbass that doesnt want to improve because youre too full of yourself and its holding back your build from being great. can you read that?
creations-chat 2022-08-06 08:51:04 its just infuriating when you see a build with a ton of potential and the guy making it is braindead <:nooo:787097964946259978> 
also its a minor fix that will make it so much better 😭
creations-chat 2022-08-06 08:53:09 fr im always right about everything so if you disagree you are literally disabled
creations-chat 2022-08-06 08:55:15 but seriously please just do the simple fix it will make your plane look so much better
creations-chat 2022-08-06 08:57:48 popular jets like that are never made well fr

<@504499525067472899> aww you little stinkball you 😊
creations-chat 2022-08-06 08:59:50 bro ong why are you resisting this basic change that will vastly improve your build? if you genuinely dont care that much why dont you just make it look like this https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/384025409945337856/1005354149862445066/RobloxScreenShot20220806_003023249.png

creations-chat 2022-08-07 08:31:36 simply make a second creations channel for experts only. will motivate whitenames to get good and fix the flooding of horrendous builds in creations drowning out the good good
creations-chat 2022-08-07 08:39:30 increase requirements also all the dumbass kids who randomly upvote because they dont know any better will probably only look at the expert channel while people with actual opinions will be deciding

honestly there should be a rule that if you get 150 upvotes on any build you can get expert regardless of block count
creations-chat 2022-08-07 08:43:00 i havent seen a non meme build get 300 in forever bro (except for my boat <:clueless:942802644043464734> <:clueless:942802644043464734> <:clueless:942802644043464734> )
creations-chat 2022-08-07 08:46:50 yes but that includes rank 1-4 which is dumb

creations-chat 2022-08-07 08:53:46 i dont see how pcc became so lifeless in 3 months. i get banned, come back 3 months later and everyone i know is gone, creations is an endless flow of diarrhea, vip severs are empty, and channels arent being talked in nearly as much
creations-chat 2022-08-07 08:55:52 rikje just needs to give more updates like goddam silence has never helped any game company or their ip besides no mans sky
creations-chat 2022-08-07 08:58:09 ip = intellectual property
creations-chat 2022-08-07 09:00:48 the difference is that tf2 is an iconic and essentially flawless game (not counting community created issues like bots or drama) that many consider timeless and or the best fps ever 

there are hundreds of sandbox games pc isnt special and its a glitchy mess.

<@615232685916553218> intellectual property is a basic term wdym
creations-chat 2022-08-07 09:05:20 all i was saying is that nms is probably the only game that has directly benefited from radio silence from the dev in case someone wanted to correct me for saying that silence has never helped any game or dev. i wasnt comparing it to pc in any way

<@456226577798135808> well yeah but devs leave games for other projects thats standard. the crux of the issue that valve pretends to still care and it blueballs the community which leads to the massive amounts of salt and whatever else that has been poisoning it since 2018

creations-chat 2022-08-07 14:00:18 i was at their level for about 2 weeks then i improved

besides im not at that level anymore which gives me all the reason to hate their builds
creations-chat 2022-08-07 14:03:19 thats like saying “bro you were a child once that means you hating messy annoying little shits with the brain function of a single celled organism is irrational”
creations-chat 2022-08-07 14:05:23 <@195253906333368320> please do this and maybe adjust the standards for expert depending on if the non high rank channel gets less or more vote traffic
yes make expert designer 150 and make it so if your build gets 150 upvotes you can get that specific expert type regardless of block count
creations-chat 2022-08-07 14:07:53 incredibly undeserving of that many votes
creations-chat 2022-08-07 14:10:14 yeah but you also have to remember that a lot of the mods dont play the game or are still the same skill level they were when they joined and dont really have a grasp on our standards
nor do they care

creations-chat 2022-08-07 20:09:02 i still believe in gun rights but full autos and shit like that should stay (mostly) outlawed since they are only practical for mass shootings. no one is gonna be carrying around a full auto for self defense it doesnt make sense <:clueless:942802644043464734> <:clueless:942802644043464734> 
also there should be more laws about storage and in-home safety. almost all gun deaths are self inflicted purposefully or accidentally and thats gay

contest-chat 2022-08-08 05:09:45 
creations-chat 2022-08-08 05:37:48 he didnt downvote my quattro which is the closest hes come to liking one of my builds. doesnt matter tho cause hes a piss baby who has never made a mini build in his life
creations-chat 2022-08-08 05:41:44 he cries about pixel inaccuracies and exposed motorlock but his builds are so mid. he denies it but he let hof go straight to his head. he also blocked me because i said i hate his asshole friendgroup
creations-chat 2022-08-08 05:47:11 fr. the worst thing about him is that he thinks he now’s everything about all build types. he will rip something to shreds that he has never even attempted to make and jts annoying

<@611251614178869269> if he agrees that his builds are mid he has absolutely no right to have standards that are so unrealistically high and especially on things he isn’t qualified to talk about due to lack of experience. simple as
creations-chat 2022-08-08 05:50:55 theres such thing as an invalid opinion. you wouldnt trust that normal person to be a politician or trust that they know how to solve issues if they know nothing about politics. hars is exactly like that except the lacks he humility to shut up about things he doesnt know abt

ok bye

creations-chat 2022-08-08 06:39:23 yes but alphabet "people" and guns dont outway essentially everything else
creations-chat 2022-08-08 06:48:38 healthcare, civil rights, decentralization of power, etc. the problem with people like you and (previously) me is the media has brainwashed us to be too radicalized to see the smaller things and think everything is black and white when there are 50 shades of gray 

<@513966516958658561> stfu no one cares about you rn
creations-chat 2022-08-08 06:51:00 <:stuff:908917207986208828>
creations-chat 2022-08-08 06:54:31 the fact that people dont care about is both sides can be radical and both sides politicians are horrendously corrupt. what they aim to do is divide the people. remember 
"We the people..."
creations-chat 2022-08-08 07:00:07 brainwashed statement
you literally just said "republicans bad liberals good"
creations-chat 2022-08-08 07:05:31 not gonna start an argument on abortion since we've already established we strongly disagree. 
anyway you seem to take minorities and majorities and generalize. like saying all repubs are radical and all liberals arent that far left. 50 shades guh. yes both sides sucks but its the loud minorities like radicals that accentuate the issue of political radicalization in the us
creations-chat 2022-08-08 07:08:01 ok thats just a dumb statement. a party is made up of people, im talking about the people.
all i want is for corruption to be decreased for both sides

and materials too
creations-chat 2022-08-08 15:08:14 it just looks hella plain for a massive ship like that
mainly cause theres no variety in any aspect of the build

give it equipment and shit. also where are the arresting wires
creations-chat 2022-08-08 15:11:12 <@413827183790915607> 

<@456226577798135808> angle locking is kinda impractical for smth like that but it could be a lot smoother

creations-chat 2022-08-08 15:19:37 why is the wooden flight deck one solid color and not wood? why is the giant ship that has been exposed to nasty sea water the entire length of its existence completely spotless and once again one solid color? why does the aircraft carrier not have arresting wires? 
looks like its missing railings too. which specific ship is it i wanna go more in depth
creations-chat 2022-08-08 15:22:14 quite frankly not letting a build with potential slip into shittiness

creations-chat 2022-08-08 15:56:17 no but maybe add wear and tear in some places also are you gonna do hull color variation next?
creations-chat 2022-08-08 16:08:24 yes but make the gray variation a little more extreme (by like 3-4)
creations-chat 2022-08-08 16:10:30 add 3-4 to what you have
creations-chat 2022-08-08 20:19:45 i would if it was worth arguing about cause even with its issues its still better than all of your builds, is easily the best 1 wide f-18, and will likely remain that way for the next couple of months

creations-chat 2022-08-09 15:14:53 use real blueprints also the m60-2000 has a very m60 looking hull not an abrams reskin
creations-chat 2022-08-09 15:26:18 make the actual m60-2000 since it having what is essentially a regular m60 hull with an abrams turret is what makes it unique and cool. if you dont like it just make a regular abrams

creations-chat 2022-08-10 06:46:40 reading books is considered an educational hobby so id call this a hobby (unless you only read wikipedia and nothing else) 
ngl the cold war is the best. you have fast jet, big boat, main shattle tank, etc

also yes stuff like that is why i love doing this. you read about smth and you think “hey that sounds familiar” and then you go down the rabbit hole and learn that some random coat hook has roots in a ww2 tanker wanting to have a secure place to keep his gear on his tank or smth like that

hell naw 💀
creations-chat 2022-08-11 14:09:13 imma be real this is awful. dont camera lock something just for the sake of having camera lock. all of those angles couldve and shouldve been done with motors and pistons except maybe the wings. also the corsair is p much a perfect cylinder so idk why you made yours 1 wide and 2 tall

imo camera lock should only be used when there isn’t enough room for angle lock without exposed or for pvp builds.
creations-chat 2022-08-11 14:13:27 i see so imma going to go ahead and flex my corsair which was my (technically second) first camera locked  build <:clueless:942802644043464734> <:clueless:942802644043464734> <:clueless:942802644043464734>
