creations-chat 2022-12-17 14:35:46 wow
creations-chat 2022-12-17 14:53:20 wing not swept enough
help 2022-12-17 16:09:44 no
help 2022-12-17 16:16:07 for roll u can use small propellers 
pitch also can
yaw also can
help 2022-12-17 16:17:10 u can literally stick it to the main motorlock[ if there's one]
help 2022-12-17 16:19:57 this is how i did mine
help 2022-12-17 16:20:58 they only work at low speeds while the motor 2 works better at higher speeds
help 2022-12-17 16:24:36 having wing panels at the sides while also being far from the centre actually inhibits your ability to roll

creations-chat 2023-02-13 13:48:43 i would do that next time
creations-chat 2023-02-13 14:04:41 wrong chat?
||i expected this kind of stuff to be on creations but ok||
creations-chat 2023-02-13 14:54:50 Is it worth the compromise if I motorlocked the control surfaces to have smooth leading edge colours?
eg. My f-22's elevators
creations-chat 2023-02-13 14:57:31 bruh I mean the motorlock would be located at the elevators which would make them very visible
creations-chat 2023-02-25 11:06:22 these parts you mean?
creations-chat 2023-02-25 11:17:13 its a f-22
creations-chat 2023-02-25 13:43:03 why tho
creations-chat 2023-02-25 13:45:21 **Noted with thanks.**
creations-chat 2023-02-25 13:48:25 when i use it i find it quite unpredictable so i mostly use angle locking with motors
creations-chat 2023-02-25 13:52:56 sure i may try adding it next time
creations-chat 2023-02-26 03:31:25 which is worse
creations-chat 2023-02-26 03:33:47 *vomits blood*
