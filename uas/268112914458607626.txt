plane-crazy 2019-05-25 21:24:02 and he said "i just wanted to say welcome" "anyway goodbye"
plane-crazy 2019-05-25 21:23:32 to which i replied "what do you want?"
plane-crazy 2019-05-25 21:23:19 just said "hi comarde" "i see you are new"
plane-crazy 2019-05-25 21:22:48 well from looking at his profile it was the only mutual server i had with him
