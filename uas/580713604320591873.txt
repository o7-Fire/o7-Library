creations-chat 2021-03-11 02:09:01 As a guy who sucks in motor lock, I find this offensive
help 2021-03-11 02:11:31 Fun Fact : If you are not good at building, here is a method to improve it easy with no cheats and hacks

So basically all you have yo do is to find builds with good amount of upvotes and looks realistic, then screen capture the builds you see and you like it. Then set up a folder on your device named as "PC Design Reference". So whenever you start building, you can take some builds you saved as a reference. Works well with me so hope it helpes you
help 2021-03-11 02:12:20 I saved up these builds so far
creations-chat 2021-03-11 02:13:12 You don't get it, it is literal pain for me bc I wanted to make reactive plates, thicker wings and window frames
creations-chat 2021-03-11 02:15:26 this shape looks good, well done but you can fill up the rhombus hole so looks perfect

creations-chat 2021-03-29 03:10:14 hey hey hey no toxic
creations-chat 2021-03-29 03:12:52 Allow me to say that your builds should have custom colours and not default ones. And you should add details like ladders and trails......use motor lock for window frames and other stuff that you want the part to be detailed
creations-chat 2021-03-29 03:16:23 one sarcastic dude who asks for advice and ignores some people who gave them.....genius <:empty:794431705070174238>
creations-chat 2021-03-29 03:18:31 Then make it x2 bigger

When you make twice the size of your heli then you can add more details and get more hitpoints in pvp
creations-chat 2021-03-29 03:21:22 around 150-200 blocks then it will be suitable.
