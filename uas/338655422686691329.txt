plane-crazy 2020-06-15 10:30:42 idk if i worded that correct
plane-crazy 2020-06-15 10:30:37 is there a way to turn rotational inertia into forward momentum?
plane-crazy 2020-06-11 01:15:23 as well as the max torque
plane-crazy 2020-06-11 01:15:17 just using 3rd person
plane-crazy 2020-06-11 01:15:13 Try aiming around without activating the camera
plane-crazy 2020-06-11 01:14:34 that and if the turret weighs too much for the motors
plane-crazy 2020-06-11 01:14:24 or at least i find it does
plane-crazy 2020-06-11 01:14:17 when you use cameras for 1st person with mouse aim it tends to make things jitter a lot
plane-crazy 2020-06-11 01:13:59 then that's the issue
plane-crazy 2020-06-11 01:13:39 like, to aim in 1st person?
plane-crazy 2020-06-11 01:13:08 storm are you using a camera on it?
plane-crazy 2020-06-08 10:26:07 i'm gonna make a steam engine in besiege
plane-crazy 2020-06-08 10:14:50 if you're gonna add train wheels make the track longer, since you can only drive for about 5 seconds before having to stop or getting flung off the tracks due to the stupid intersections
plane-crazy 2020-06-08 10:13:50 why add train wheels if there's no real reason to make trains
plane-crazy 2020-06-03 22:15:04 it's on the popular tab
plane-crazy 2020-06-03 22:15:00 but
plane-crazy 2020-06-03 22:14:59 right at the end
plane-crazy 2020-06-03 22:14:54 plane crazy is on the popular tab
plane-crazy 2020-05-29 00:01:40 oh wow
plane-crazy 2020-05-29 00:01:28 what
plane-crazy 2020-05-29 00:01:00 hover thrusters wouldn't get attached to the disconnectors
plane-crazy 2020-05-29 00:00:43 it is i think.
plane-crazy 2020-05-29 00:00:41 actually yeah
plane-crazy 2020-05-29 00:00:36 i mean
plane-crazy 2020-05-28 23:59:40 hover thrusters
plane-crazy 2020-05-28 23:54:54 in other peoples eyes
plane-crazy 2020-05-28 23:54:49 i really don't care how good i am
plane-crazy 2020-05-28 23:54:07 or p'raps it's because i'm trying to build small
plane-crazy 2020-05-28 23:53:47 except the shorter side
plane-crazy 2020-05-28 23:53:41 0.9 blocks still stick on every other side
plane-crazy 2020-05-28 23:53:22 because
plane-crazy 2020-05-28 23:53:14 '0.9 block bro'
plane-crazy 2020-05-28 23:53:10 say
plane-crazy 2020-05-28 23:53:09 DO not
plane-crazy 2020-05-28 23:53:08 i've suggested it a few times
plane-crazy 2020-05-28 23:53:01 tool to make blocks not stick
plane-crazy 2020-05-28 23:52:49 plane crazy needs some kind of uh
plane-crazy 2020-05-25 12:32:27 imagine wings
plane-crazy 2020-05-25 12:32:23 pff

plane-crazy 2020-03-01 12:45:15 very fast
plane-crazy 2020-03-01 12:45:13 i made one
plane-crazy 2020-03-01 12:45:11 you can make warp drives with the hover engine
plane-crazy 2020-02-05 22:09:54 would suspension'd feet help a walker
plane-crazy 2020-01-08 22:02:40 <:pogey:651848693842182144>
plane-crazy 2020-01-08 22:02:08 Make a vr suit in plane crazy
plane-crazy 2020-01-08 22:02:00 imagine one day someone makes some suit that detects muscle movement, and you set each and every muscle and so on as different keys, maybe on a custom keyboard
plane-crazy 2020-01-08 22:01:23 I really wanna invent something mad in plane crazy but basically everything has been done
plane-crazy 2020-01-08 22:00:58 Damn
plane-crazy 2019-12-28 21:27:50 just because i've been learning it for about half a year
plane-crazy 2019-12-28 21:27:36 ok frenchy sweat
plane-crazy 2019-12-28 21:02:23 Ca les terribles
plane-crazy 2019-12-28 20:43:01 If I were mad I'd go and give someone hell
plane-crazy 2019-12-28 20:42:52 but we've got to wait until the 5th of jan
plane-crazy 2019-12-28 20:42:24 But he's been online twice now since the announcement
plane-crazy 2019-12-28 20:41:49 i know
plane-crazy 2019-12-28 20:41:31 all that needs to happen is for mad to get on roblox and publish it
plane-crazy 2019-12-28 20:41:18 Ricks done it all
plane-crazy 2019-12-28 20:41:11 The update is done
plane-crazy 2019-12-28 20:41:07 No
plane-crazy 2019-12-28 20:40:45 might as well be a spring update because that's what it's looking like
plane-crazy 2019-12-28 20:40:29 bro the update was meant to be 4 days ago and now it's the 5th of jan?
plane-crazy 2019-12-28 20:40:00 5th of fucking jan
plane-crazy 2019-12-28 17:12:42 uuh
plane-crazy 2019-12-28 12:54:25 There's a lot of rumours but I'm sticking to what rick said in announcements
plane-crazy 2019-12-28 12:53:40 for literally 2 seconds to do the update
plane-crazy 2019-12-28 12:53:25 Someone ought to tell madattack about this magical thing called linking your pc up to a mobile hotspot
plane-crazy 2019-12-28 12:52:18 feels bad man
plane-crazy 2019-12-28 12:51:34 On the thumbnail for plane crazy, it says 'One million visits' But we've nearly got 20 million
plane-crazy 2019-12-26 14:09:29 watch out
plane-crazy 2019-12-26 14:09:22 wowowowowo
plane-crazy 2019-12-25 11:59:14 What if....
plane-crazy 2019-12-25 11:35:49 At least the Nazis are good now
plane-crazy 2019-12-25 11:35:39 Hey
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 18:27:27 and tall mountains
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 18:27:23 with planets
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 18:27:20 and space
plane-crazy 2019-12-08 00:54:52 Yes.
plane-crazy 2019-11-28 23:12:17 I got the rank.
plane-crazy 2019-11-28 23:12:15 I've got it
plane-crazy 2019-11-28 23:05:21 Do I need to ping anyone when I request a role? Or do I just wait?
plane-crazy 2019-11-28 22:53:13 That's basically the whole game then
plane-crazy 2019-11-28 22:51:17 For robotic specialist, I have to be able to turn. Can I just use propellers for that?
plane-crazy 2019-11-28 22:43:40 m
plane-crazy 2019-11-28 22:43:38 platfor
plane-crazy 2019-11-28 22:43:37 it can walk from spawn to the other end of the black road thing
plane-crazy 2019-11-28 22:43:25 It's actually quite good
plane-crazy 2019-11-28 22:42:50 I just made my first walker
plane-crazy 2019-11-28 22:42:43 I'm really happy
plane-crazy 2019-11-28 17:58:52 Oh. I never noticed that you could then.
plane-crazy 2019-11-28 17:58:23 I don't think they could.
plane-crazy 2019-11-28 17:57:47 so re-toggleable anchor
plane-crazy 2019-11-28 17:57:35 <@!313403326081531914> basically when you turn anchor off, if you press it again it freezes again
plane-crazy 2019-11-28 17:57:00 ignore it
plane-crazy 2019-11-28 17:56:57 then don't state your opinion
plane-crazy 2019-11-28 17:48:48 That's useful.
plane-crazy 2019-11-28 17:47:42 ^ I second this.
plane-crazy 2019-11-28 17:47:06 I can't see a difference
plane-crazy 2019-11-28 17:46:58 How does the physics anchor work?
plane-crazy 2019-11-26 01:41:14 cybertruck = minecraft thanos truck
plane-crazy 2019-10-16 18:47:46 Guys, is higher blast pressure on a bomb good or bad?
plane-crazy 2019-10-12 18:01:11 Can't wait till the new update comes out
plane-crazy 2019-10-11 21:37:30 <@!433617207734304778> Bro I've made a crossbow, an artillery gun with a working drawback feature, many MANY rifles, an automatic rifle and what I call the 'THWONK' gun because that's the noise i'd expect it to make since it shoots large canisters with smoke in them and i've yet to get a rank because there's no gun ranks. For a list of ranks, see <#609442446249820211>
plane-crazy 2019-10-11 14:18:43 What does max force do on a piston?
plane-crazy 2019-10-07 17:02:05 when i could've just used springs ig
plane-crazy 2019-10-07 17:01:53 i made one using suspensions, ropes and springs
plane-crazy 2019-10-07 17:01:42 oof
plane-crazy 2019-10-07 17:01:29 yes
plane-crazy 2019-10-07 16:59:55 has an artillery piece with a working drawback thingy idk what it's called been made before?
plane-crazy 2019-09-04 17:55:20 Nevermind. I found out my problem.
plane-crazy 2019-09-04 17:52:39 Because I'm making a massive turret. When it's all unconnected and the motor has no weight, it works. But as soon as I connect it, the turret doesn't work.
plane-crazy 2019-09-04 17:50:03 Wait, are motors only able to move a certain amount of blocks?
plane-crazy 2019-09-04 17:25:23 Yeah. It's getting annoying. I don't know too much about the subject but one mentioned magnet throwing or something like that and a person, supposedly the victim, is complaining about the lag, but at the same time cheering them on. But, don't get me wrong, they aren't doing it to the one person.
plane-crazy 2019-09-04 17:23:06 I wouldn't ever do it.
plane-crazy 2019-09-04 17:23:02 Alright. Because I joined a server with 2 people trying to lag other people.
plane-crazy 2019-09-04 17:21:54 Is repeatedly using laggy tactics to make other people lag against the rules?
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 16:58:40 What I mean is would I be able to suggest something?
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 16:58:25 In the suggestions channel, by "you have to have a rank to suggest something" does it mean the <#609442446249820211> rank or just any kind of role
plane-crazy 2019-09-02 13:48:38 please for the love of god if more weapons get added never ever make them a gamepass
plane-crazy 2019-08-26 21:48:05 Is there any efficient and relatively easy-to-control methods of making a hover truck?
plane-crazy 2019-08-26 21:25:59 i really wish rick would add something, idk what it would be called, but you could place it on any side of a block or wedge and then blocks that are placed on it won't then stick to it, E.G: like minecraft, so it would be possible to make sliding pistons that don't look ugly, for instance so my truck can have rockets that slide out of the sides without it being too obvious and ugly
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 17:34:47 what the hell is going on
plane-crazy 2019-08-03 23:15:31 Thanks.
plane-crazy 2019-08-03 23:15:28 I kept searching for 'starcraft'
plane-crazy 2019-08-03 23:15:19 Ah. I thought it ended with craft.
plane-crazy 2019-08-03 23:13:10 Hey, I asked before if there was a game like this but based in space. Someone answered, not sure who, with a game, but I can't remember the name. Can you remind me of the name? You said it was free, and I'm interested in getting it.
plane-crazy 2019-08-01 21:41:41 wait nvm wrong fuckin server
plane-crazy 2019-08-01 21:41:21 This game gonna be free after alpha?
plane-crazy 2019-08-01 21:28:32 Is there a way to suspend things in the air using magnets?
plane-crazy 2019-08-01 17:09:34 that hurts my eyes to look at
plane-crazy 2019-08-01 17:03:58 i'm going to make a hand
plane-crazy 2019-08-01 16:07:38 so it would make motor doors and piston doors easier
plane-crazy 2019-08-01 16:07:28 i wish there was some kind of block that doesn't stick to other blocks
plane-crazy 2019-07-26 20:02:01 i suppose
plane-crazy 2019-07-26 20:02:00 cancelled = no longer working on it
plane-crazy 2019-07-26 20:01:22 unless it's just a placeholder for if there ever is a new mode
plane-crazy 2019-07-26 20:01:10 I really want to know what this 'WIP' mode is
plane-crazy 2019-07-26 20:00:26 what you've posted there isn't how a rubiks cube works
plane-crazy 2019-07-26 19:53:31 But it's normal, not pvp
plane-crazy 2019-07-26 19:53:24 Not full
plane-crazy 2019-07-26 19:53:14 Sure but i think it's full lemme check
plane-crazy 2019-07-26 19:51:25 That's what you get for penis rocket
plane-crazy 2019-07-26 19:51:15 I used my rocket car to ram him onto his side and off the map and he started raging.
plane-crazy 2019-07-26 19:50:56 HAHhah
plane-crazy 2019-07-26 19:47:15 Not sure where to post this. Username is XLVenomSmoker. Thinks its so cool and funny making a penis shaped rocket.
plane-crazy 2019-07-24 18:54:25 revolt
plane-crazy 2019-07-24 18:53:35 you know you've reached peak human evolution when you get triggered at my (old) username of Xx_OmqItzzPedo69_xX
plane-crazy 2019-07-24 18:52:29 no fallout 4 memes
plane-crazy 2019-07-24 18:51:49 it's an inside joke for a different server i'm on
plane-crazy 2019-07-24 18:51:18 he's on about my discord name
plane-crazy 2019-07-24 18:51:11 i thought you meant my roblox name
plane-crazy 2019-07-24 18:51:04 my discord
plane-crazy 2019-07-24 18:51:02 OH WAIT
plane-crazy 2019-07-24 18:50:53 me
plane-crazy 2019-07-24 18:50:29 british
plane-crazy 2019-07-24 18:50:25 no
plane-crazy 2019-07-24 18:50:08 go to hell
plane-crazy 2019-07-24 15:51:24 Watching him get scared and mad at people telling him he copied
plane-crazy 2019-07-24 15:51:10 It's funny.
plane-crazy 2019-07-24 15:48:49 I can agree, as I and in the server too. He says tank fish copied him.
plane-crazy 2019-07-22 21:25:41 the inside is mostly hollow
plane-crazy 2019-07-22 21:25:36 I made a large cannon box that shouldn't be as large as it is
plane-crazy 2019-07-22 19:35:37 i'm trying to give a demonstration
plane-crazy 2019-07-22 19:35:29 no i know but
plane-crazy 2019-07-22 19:35:03 it would make things like these easier
plane-crazy 2019-07-22 19:34:31 big*ger*
plane-crazy 2019-07-22 19:33:50 yeah it would make bigger builds like bipedal mechs a lot easier
plane-crazy 2019-07-22 19:33:34 heh
plane-crazy 2019-07-22 19:32:56 Really wish there was a mirror button, so that everything you have placed is mirrored across your plot
plane-crazy 2019-07-12 16:19:26 wait what game is that
plane-crazy 2019-07-12 16:16:57 imagine a plane crazy but it took part in space and you could explore planets and solar systems and galaxies and have massive spaceships that are the size of real-life cities and have massive wars
plane-crazy 2019-07-11 20:41:37 Because there's a submarine with a swastika on it in this server
plane-crazy 2019-07-11 20:41:22 Is a submarine with a swastika on the top of it allowed?
plane-crazy 2019-07-11 20:20:42 just get your mate to shoot a turret on a car while you drive
plane-crazy 2019-07-11 20:20:29 that'd be a sick idea for turrets
plane-crazy 2019-07-11 20:20:15 yeah i know now
plane-crazy 2019-07-11 20:19:51 i thought it let your friends operate your creations
plane-crazy 2019-07-11 20:19:40 right
plane-crazy 2019-07-11 20:19:02 What does the pilot seat do? I know the main pilot seat but what about just the pilot seat?
plane-crazy 2019-07-11 19:19:20 but it's still different to normal plastic
plane-crazy 2019-07-11 19:19:13 not rlly
plane-crazy 2019-07-11 19:18:57 and glass
plane-crazy 2019-07-11 19:18:09 so does metal material make blocks stronger or somethin
plane-crazy 2019-07-11 19:17:49 damn
plane-crazy 2019-07-11 19:17:47 wait, does it actually give friction?
plane-crazy 2019-07-11 19:15:24 wish there was wedge friction blocks for slightly better wheels
plane-crazy 2019-07-09 20:02:23 i wish there was a really long train track that doesn't have intersections because i wanna see how fast my train can go before derailing and i wanna see if i can walk around in it and other stuff but the damn rail is so small and i can't do much because i have to constantly click buttons to move the intersections
plane-crazy 2019-07-09 18:41:03 
plane-crazy 2019-07-09 18:40:05 That's what I do.
plane-crazy 2019-07-09 18:40:01 If it matters to anybody, use 0.9 blocks with the rails to make your train as stable as possible.
plane-crazy 2019-07-09 18:22:30 for knees and such
plane-crazy 2019-07-09 18:22:22 hinges could be used for mechs
plane-crazy 2019-07-09 17:22:50 I mean like the besiege steering hinge. https://besiege.fandom.com/wiki/Steering_Hinge
plane-crazy 2019-07-09 17:20:54 Wish there was some kind of hinge, so I don't have to do fiddly things with motors.
plane-crazy 2019-07-07 02:31:04 wall-3
plane-crazy 2019-07-06 20:16:43 Lmao. This guy just came up to me and said 'copy guy'. I'm not sure if he mean's I'm copying him, because he's making a rocket too, or if I'm copying it of yt, in which case that is also not true
