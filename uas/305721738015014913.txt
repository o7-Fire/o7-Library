plane-crazy 2020-07-26 19:04:05 Make a list
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 19:00:27 <_<
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 18:04:04 unless you want the wings disconnected & using Ball wheels on a wall inside the vehicle or such
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 18:03:32 Yeah only motors
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 18:03:18 Well...
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 17:40:22 Need something stable enough to withstand 2 domes spinning at 30-50 with 1000 Torque on while having full control of weapons & such
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 17:39:40 Cos im thinking of a Large 'Shield Helicarrier' style aircraft to mount a full scale Shredder Denial System to
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 17:38:58 Would a Quad-Copter (4 Rotary blades) be ok for that rank?
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 17:37:54 Hardest one for me will be Helicopter technitian
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 17:37:12 Just need to bother doing them
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 17:37:01 I will be adding more ranks to my collection tho
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 17:36:48 I mean, i have an 'expert' rank but cant use '!servers'
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 17:36:25 Not gonna be able to get in game. Parents are having a Live Digi-Concert. Cant work on the Shredder Denial Shield :P
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 06:16:06 *how do you push a blacklist box-*

plane-crazy 2020-07-25 06:10:10 "and if that don' work..."
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 06:10:02 "You use a gun"
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 05:56:50 it always starts crap. Its about learning
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 05:55:06 my first propper build was a creappy aircraft with too many features
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 05:54:48 Awesome

plane-crazy 2020-07-25 05:53:08 *You've unintentionally, single handedly brought a depression to PVP*
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 05:52:26 I just realised
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 05:52:14 <@!582598719916998692> Your the bloke who invented it

plane-crazy 2020-07-25 05:50:45 4-5 servers, clean them of bugs if we can
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 05:50:29 The hunt begins
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 05:49:36 time to erase the shredder bug population
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 05:49:26 the Shredder Shield has claimed its first Quitter

plane-crazy 2020-07-25 01:18:01 ohoh lets see. this PVP server is clean housed
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 01:17:24 this is Destiny BTW, my latest creation & my litteral child  in PC
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 01:17:03 i think the modern one is either a Shredder Bug (again) or Cutter worm
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 01:16:46 it was overtakne by the "monster bug" then "Monster worm"
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 01:16:31 Well its origin name is "Shredder Bug"
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 01:16:03 Im officially stating its gotta be one of the best Planes i've ever seen. Not a stratch, made em leave
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 01:15:40 the Destiny jsut whooped a Shredder Bug's ass
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 01:15:34 ladies and gentlemen
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 00:10:46 **c h a n k**
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 22:47:30 how fast should i be for landing?
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 22:47:17 ight, i'll aim for it
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 22:46:33 teleported
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 22:45:49 ight, you in my game or am i coming to you?
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 22:45:26 and i think i'll do that
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 22:45:21 unless i remodel the entire thing
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 22:45:13 Thinking your Smol carrier is 100 or more blocks long, i realise the Overlord will not be able to dock the Drones it deploys
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 22:44:21 hehe
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 22:44:18 Actually my first time trying to land on a carrier
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 22:44:04 ight
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 22:43:57 you in game atm?
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 22:43:52 That can do the job if brake early
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 22:43:21 How long is the carrier?
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 22:43:14 i can fit on the carrier then, but OverClock is f a s t
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 22:43:04 I can use OverClock to reduce wingspan
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 22:42:47 HM
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 22:41:27 how small?
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 22:40:58 Anyone here got an aircraft carrier? I wanna try and land on it and see if i can use the Folded up storage mode
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 22:29:30 cos 90% who vote are either extremely judging or downvote thinking their builds are better
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 22:27:44 hm...

plane-crazy 2020-07-24 22:18:51 I have a solution
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 22:18:18 Nannoc, can you share how you did air brakes? Im incredibly curious. Sorry to interrupt
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 22:15:54 **evolution**
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 22:15:51 I dont have air brakes on Destiny, knowing how they work would be
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 22:15:36 DO SHARE
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 22:15:34 I'll have to get Fireworks for this alt next year to install the bomber feature-
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 22:15:17 Eh, drat
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 22:14:59 or is it 4th july celebration?
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 22:14:51 Fireworks come out annually in the winter right? Around christmas?
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 22:14:08 its about helping people out
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 22:14:03 Depends on the experience tho, it aint about banning folk
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 22:13:38 So no more in-game mods?
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 22:13:22 And uh, i still agree tho
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 22:13:09 kek
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 22:13:08 If reports came back, you'd see hundreds of Shredder worms being reported for toxicity
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 22:11:29 ... spike pit?
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 22:05:34 it sucks that this is on my Alt account and not my main, but oh well
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 22:04:50 but with a few weeks, i can master this
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 22:04:42 The overlock is finicky, as due to the increase in speed you gotta manually adjust the wings as the speed increases to maintain the ability to turn
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 22:03:50 and what i need to practice changing between mid flight
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 22:03:41 Those *'Modes'* are what i need to remember
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 22:03:25 And uh, this is me experimenting with Wing shapes & positions
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 22:03:14 Bomber Mode : slower turning & Slower speed for pinpoint stability.

Fighter mode : Incredible mobility , amazing speed. 

Overlock : Messes with physics to break the Top speed, havent found a limit yet
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 22:01:44 the future of Flight.
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 22:01:38 "Destiny"
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 22:01:36 All three modes of the beauty ive named
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 22:01:26 
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 22:01:23 here it is
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 21:56:42 I'd give you a chocolate bar and a pat on the back if i could
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 21:56:22 10k?
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 21:56:19 ive only gone up to 8k blocks at most, suppressed with beams, but jesus christ
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 21:56:00 oh god
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 21:55:49 ouch
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 21:55:44 
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 21:55:10 and an Assault Submarine of about 800
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 21:55:03 A small attack sub of about 300 blocks
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 21:54:54 If i go to my collection page, i have 2 subs.
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 21:54:39 ngl, you can recover from that
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 21:54:16 Submarine? Awesome.
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 21:53:51 But, wooden box gets 62 likes while a miracle of PC engineering that took weeks to make gets about 7
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 21:53:25 Yeah, i like to judge based on a persons skill level. I believe im good at seeing someones limits
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 21:52:42 i BET you if i did it One Image at a time
1.Those people would've upvoted
2. I would've been warned for flood
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 21:52:14 y'know i think ima give it a day or two before sharing this in <#384025409945337856> after my 'Collage' post showing everything i've built in the last two days got over 20 downvotes
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 21:51:29 Oof
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 21:36:52 AHAHAHAHA!
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 21:36:51 AHA! THIS IS WHY I PLAY THIS GAME!!!
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 21:36:42 Maybe i can have a fold out hydrofoil to lift me out the water & quickly swing it back to lift off
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 21:36:17 Well not quite. needs a little more ooomph
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 21:35:42 IM A GENIUS! AAHAHAHAHAH
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 21:35:37 and launch from underwater
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 21:35:33 It can transform into a submarine
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 21:35:27 I turned it into a Submarine too
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 21:35:22 oh my
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 21:30:20 I just gotta practice it
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 21:30:15 into Bomber flight & fighter flight
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 21:30:05 Since it can toggle its wing shape, positions
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 21:29:57 So, this would be a Multi-Role / All Purpose Aircraft
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 21:29:24 Ah
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 21:29:02 Carrier storage complete
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 21:26:57 or is it the "L ? "Foxtrot" "Theta" "harold" Five Three Slash One
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 21:26:26 I imagine the letters have meanings?
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 21:24:56 see the gimmic? Big flashy names that you an pronounce in 10 different ways in a cinematic tone
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 21:24:28 the Submersible Battleship will be the Dynasty
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 21:24:18 my 3k Tank is the Adamantite
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 21:23:57 this is one of those flashy vehicles in my eyes
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 21:23:49 hmm... i was thinking something more *entitled*. I name my 'special' vehicles big flashy names
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 21:23:05 I dont have a name for it
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 21:23:01 One problem tho
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 21:22:27 *I love it*
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 21:22:20 to completely change its flight into this long turn, smoothish bomber style movment
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 21:22:04 and make adjustments
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 21:21:57 it can be a fast, extremely mobile fighter making turns too fast for my computer to like
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 21:21:38 This bad boi has some motor m a g i c
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 21:21:27 Trust me, that tail has so much fun added to it
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 21:20:40 I am absolutely baffled with myself lol
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 21:20:23 
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 21:19:19 looking at my other craft and blending it together
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 21:19:07 by litterally analysing other peoples MIGs, SUs, Fs and small aircraft
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 21:18:37 My greatest aircraft yet
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 21:18:32 ive done it :3
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 19:15:59 so uh... sorry for the pointless comment
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 19:15:50 Not really. Our leg style is very different
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 19:15:17 ngl i made the legs of an ATAT in under 200 blocks

plane-crazy 2020-07-24 17:12:56 With the power of Alts i will have at least 30 Individual vehicles across all forms of Terrain & sizes by the time I'm done
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 17:12:30 Meh. Dont care too much for votes. I sorta use the Creations channel to log my progress. I can search back in <#504436696021204992> 's history and find all my old garbage builds, and see how far i've improved
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 17:07:44 *i wonder if posting Creation collages & describing my experience triggers more downvotes*
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 14:18:46 ik but how the heck does that *compress*
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 14:18:23 still confused how you fit so much stuff inside those tiny turrets
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 14:15:50 lol
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 14:15:49 im gonna no think too far ahead
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 14:15:38 An aircraft ramming tool
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 14:15:29 As it will double as a normal Cutter defence, and if mounted to an aircraft
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 14:15:14 then it could very well change plane Crazy's PVP
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 14:14:48 ngl if the Shredder shield works & i can improve it
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 14:14:13 For now ima finish my Tonk Destroyer (Cavorite Class) and then i'll work on a Shredder Shield Generator
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 14:13:45 All welcome ideas.
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 14:13:26 proved a high velocity spinner can be put into a combat plane
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 14:13:11 my Stardust Class Astrocraft however...
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 14:12:52 i have not yet made a Mobile Vehicle that can use it
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 14:12:43 Again, still a prototype and only had 3 tests, all on stationary platforms
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 14:12:09 Im considering building a Mobile Shredder Shield for allies now lol
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 14:11:48 If you less lucky, they will be flung a good few miles away
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 14:11:35 if your lucky, they go straight to the abyss & die
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 14:11:27 When a high force cutter meets the cutter of a Shredder bug, the motors in the shredder bug have a seizure and cause the Bug to be flung at 10k+ speeds
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 14:10:43 Higher FPS = Stronger Repel
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 14:10:35 your FPS is key to its power
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 14:10:26 and then spun in a circle at top speed ^ torque with reset & toggle
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 14:10:08 with cutters horizontally lining them
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 14:09:55 Its a stick, connected to a stick
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 14:09:48 Basically
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 14:09:28 but thats not how my 'Shield' works
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 14:09:19 tbh, i did wanna know how to build a Gyrosphere to thx anyway
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 14:08:54 He's building a Gyrosphere in that anyway
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 14:08:35 no I didnt googlee some Yt tutorial
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 14:08:26 wot
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 14:06:35 believe what you wanna believe, but you can see my celebration via the message finder in the top right search bar
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 14:06:09 s i g h
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 14:06:00 3. Its only got a stationary prototype atm
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 14:05:47 2. I can record the future.
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 14:05:42 1. I cant record the past.
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 14:05:20 They couldn't touch me
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 14:05:14 i tested i when i was attacked by two Shredders
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 14:05:02 It does
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 14:05:00 its mobile, or will be mobile
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 14:04:56 No
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 14:04:51 thats why i call it a *forcefield*
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 14:04:36 I have effectively made a deployable barrier that *uses force* in a *field* to delete Shredder bugs
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 14:03:58 **Not exactly**
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 14:03:38 Instakills the craps
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 14:03:28 Screw Shredder bugs. I have a WIP forcefield
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 14:03:16 how does that jumble compress into a single turret?
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 14:03:08 Maple
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 14:03:02 how does
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 14:03:00 wait
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 14:02:52 huh
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 14:01:27 neato. Is it mobile?
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 14:01:15 *Im having a conversation*
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 14:01:08 Im sending messages too quick?
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 14:00:59 ... what?
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 14:00:52 thats fine. Google translate exists
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 14:00:36 Hi brazilian player
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 13:59:41 That looks really good
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 13:59:29 Trying to use my Dweller Class Submarine would be hell
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 13:59:16 Small ones, but not proper battleships
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 13:58:02 very nice turret
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 13:57:52 Not enough space for a full server do to naval battl
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 13:57:31 And yes, I say Forcefield with full seriousness
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 13:57:11 I have a forcefield im working on that sends them to the abyss on contact
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 13:56:58 Nope
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 13:16:13 or how A million searches for Sonic appeared in a day
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 13:16:02 like how FNAF made a comeback outa nowhere
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 13:15:46 I like to think everyone is secretly connected in a hive mind. Cos whenever one of us is going through an internet phase, everyone is
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 12:33:30 seriously tho what is that
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 12:33:20 **shredder bug would like to know your location**
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 12:32:12 **as badd**
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 12:32:09 RadCadd has been identified
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 12:24:20 *christ*
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:14:14 16 rounds, fires cluster shots
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:14:00 it was part of my Monochromatic Assault Bot MK1
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:13:35 i detonated myself a few times doing it
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:13:27 I think so
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:13:20 Ye, and keep pushing till they start to seizure
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:11:01 idek how else to describe that
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:10:49 WHOOSH
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:10:48 it just goes
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:10:46 And basically that does something for momentum, so when it launches
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:10:26 and held it there, (toggle yes)
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:10:19 I did a thing with magnets, where the conveyers push the TNT Ball into the back wall of the gun before firing at high speed
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:09:52 y'know how you use conveyors to move TNT balls?
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:09:42 Ye, i have done one thing
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:09:25 Ngl may try that
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:08:14 an you even put cutters in a railgun?
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:08:04 ... cutter TNT railgun?
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:07:58 Cutter railgun or TNT railgun
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:07:52 wait whats more deadly
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:07:46 Fired Cluster shots
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:07:38 Only 'railgun' i've ever made as a conveyor & Magnet Gun
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:07:06 He doesnt Kill everyone! He kills campers :3
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:06:53 I've met a GOOD Shredder bug user
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:06:46 I CANT BELIEVE IT
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:06:06 yes
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:06:02 *EcKsPlosiOn*
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:05:52 and go too fast...
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:05:48 and moun it too an aircraft
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:05:42 if you do what i did
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:05:36 Ye, problem is
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:05:24 Gun & Rocket Immunity
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:05:19 I did a test of it
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:05:15 Yes.
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:04:51 what makes those shapes <.<
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:04:41 i see rectangles, squares
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:04:21 od shapes
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:04:19 idk
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:04:11 TNT armour by the looks of it
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:03:42 and make it large enough to act as a dome for land vehicles
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:03:20 reset & toggle
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:03:16 Spin at 50, 1000 Torque
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:03:08 basically a stick stick out, connects to a downward stick with horizontal cutters
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:02:46 cant edit it
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:02:27 you put the motor
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:02:23 that kinda shape
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:02:18 ...
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:02:16 that kinda sha-
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:01:54 like
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:01:52 No, wrong image
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:01:42 On a large stick, on a large axel
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:01:22 but that tank has mobility problems
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:01:14 so far i only got it work on a *really* large tank
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:00:44 it took 2 Shredder Bugs over 10 respawns to break through it
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:00:30 instantly into the abyss
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:00:27 it spins rod covered in cutters really fast, and when a spinning cutter meets a vertically spinning, high speed cutter...
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 09:59:53 basically it abuses the Shredder Bugs design
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 09:59:24 i just need to make it fit on an aircraft
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 09:59:16 i do however have a working forcefield machine that makes me immune to them
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 09:59:04 Lava spitters & spinning Cutter platforms are the only defence i've got for Shredder bugs
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 09:58:36 not kills, leavers.
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 09:58:27 There was this one bugger who was counting the people he made quit
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 09:58:01 also every single Shredder bug user is toxic as hell in my experience
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 09:57:38 kek
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 09:57:37 Nerf Cutters or just remove them
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 09:57:26 They're broken with PC physics.
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 07:17:33 eh, local store has some wacky croissants. Those look nice tho
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 07:16:59 makes a slight W shape on the wing
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 07:16:40 Ye, has those lil folds
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 07:15:11 More of a Croissant.
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 07:05:14 There's quite litterally a button that takes you to a PVP server. If it takes ya to the same one every time then whoop de doo, cant help that can i?
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 07:04:25 ***i am so sick of today***
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 07:04:20 *But i was very close to.*
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 07:04:14 *im aware*
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 06:58:06 I hate when you try to go to another PVP server and it keeps putting you in the exact same one
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 20:01:13 Waiting for roblox to come back online like

plane-crazy 2020-07-23 19:43:24 Roblox is being nuked again
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 19:43:16 SAVE YOUR STUFF! Roblox servers are going down!
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 08:33:12 
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 08:32:27 bloody lag machine's killing servers
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 08:32:20 Ah dammit. I forget reports aren't open anymore
plane-crazy 2020-07-16 18:33:44 Hm. Went to make a report but they're closed.
Does only rick handle reports or somethin?
plane-crazy 2020-07-16 14:56:01 Alright lemme compile something together.
plane-crazy 2020-07-16 14:55:44 Cos i got all these saves that can grant ranks and i've never done em
plane-crazy 2020-07-16 14:55:31 Can you make multiple Rank requests in one day?
plane-crazy 2020-05-13 14:55:08 not to be offensive to anyone... but Roblox is like the modern world. The Poor aren't heard unless someone's directly looking for them.
plane-crazy 2020-05-13 14:54:43 well
plane-crazy 2020-05-13 14:54:06 Gotta get dat Robux
plane-crazy 2020-05-13 14:53:09 F
plane-crazy 2020-05-13 14:53:08 also
plane-crazy 2020-05-13 14:53:01 I thought they were gonna be like Note blocks
plane-crazy 2020-05-13 14:52:50 o wait speakers just play music?
plane-crazy 2020-05-13 14:52:27 Welp time to make Astronomia again
plane-crazy 2020-05-13 14:52:15 **Speaker blocks?**
plane-crazy 2020-05-08 14:35:12 Tbh i dropped this thing months ago. Back for round 3 and i still dunno how to make a decent enough suspension
plane-crazy 2020-05-08 14:34:45 *yay*
plane-crazy 2020-05-08 14:34:24 The result of a 6k+ superheavy Fold build (with poor suspensions)
plane-crazy 2020-01-11 15:01:53 yall building an entire Map
plane-crazy 2020-01-11 15:01:46 oh boy
plane-crazy 2020-01-11 15:00:22 cos collisions and stuff
plane-crazy 2020-01-11 15:00:11 idek if it's possible
plane-crazy 2020-01-11 15:00:06 lol
plane-crazy 2020-01-11 15:00:04 with other players
plane-crazy 2020-01-11 15:00:00 i have always wanted to build a Megazord
plane-crazy 2020-01-11 14:59:53 well
plane-crazy 2020-01-11 14:59:30 Ye cos ballasts kinda do that
plane-crazy 2020-01-11 14:59:05 Boat that walks on water.
im cursed
plane-crazy 2020-01-11 14:58:38 here is my Cruising Cruise ship (Tiny Test Model). Yes i will make a fold build for it and it will be for the contest xD
plane-crazy 2020-01-11 14:57:38 on a side note
plane-crazy 2020-01-11 14:57:19 i didnt show ya, i told ya
plane-crazy 2020-01-11 14:56:24 Noodles?
plane-crazy 2020-01-11 14:56:16 different places to control.
btw
plane-crazy 2020-01-11 14:56:00 You have the Fortress Pilot seat, so your camera is focused on it
The aircraft cameras & seats
The Escape Sub Seat
and so on
plane-crazy 2020-01-11 14:55:18 lets say you have a walking fortress like me
plane-crazy 2020-01-11 14:55:10 they're alternate options for main pilot seats
plane-crazy 2020-01-11 14:54:59 only way i can suggest a secondary pilot is to use friction blocks against unpowered motors that are pushed by the player to turn
plane-crazy 2020-01-11 14:54:33 only you can pilot the vehicle
plane-crazy 2020-01-11 14:54:26 Unfortunately
plane-crazy 2020-01-11 14:54:23 Not possible.
plane-crazy 2020-01-11 14:14:35 and whoop its going straight to the contest when its done lol
plane-crazy 2020-01-11 14:14:24 pretty sure this next build of mine can be called a 'Cursed Creation'
plane-crazy 2020-01-11 13:46:44 im currently doing just that
plane-crazy 2020-01-11 13:46:40 Sounds fun Gory
plane-crazy 2020-01-11 13:46:19 *celebrating good times*
plane-crazy 2020-01-11 13:28:29 i am going to build the most unstable Boat in history
plane-crazy 2020-01-11 13:26:37 yall are not ready for what i just thought of
plane-crazy 2020-01-11 13:26:31 oh my god i have a better idea
plane-crazy 2020-01-11 13:26:26 wait
plane-crazy 2020-01-11 13:26:22 wat
plane-crazy 2020-01-11 13:26:17 What if i build a Cruiser that can eject it's shell to reveal a cruiser lol
plane-crazy 2020-01-11 13:25:23 y'think we'll ever get round corner blocks to go with the spherical stuff?
plane-crazy 2020-01-11 13:24:12 i cant read
plane-crazy 2020-01-11 13:24:09 .
plane-crazy 2020-01-11 13:23:58 it means like Cruise ships?
plane-crazy 2020-01-11 13:23:52 OH
plane-crazy 2020-01-11 13:22:42 Is that a flintstones house-
plane-crazy 2020-01-11 13:22:08 Aircraft? Boat? Starship?
plane-crazy 2020-01-11 13:21:56 O. A cruiser? What kinda Cruiser?
plane-crazy 2020-01-11 13:21:26 <.<
plane-crazy 2020-01-11 13:21:12 still gotta finish the Armata Overlord. 
Speaking of, anyone here good with suspensions?
plane-crazy 2020-01-11 13:20:56 wait no
plane-crazy 2020-01-11 13:20:39 Ima go build a Mech or something
plane-crazy 2020-01-11 13:20:34 that settles my daily rant.
plane-crazy 2020-01-11 13:20:28 Welp.
plane-crazy 2020-01-11 13:20:05 Hm.
plane-crazy 2020-01-11 13:19:39 yeah ive seen some fantastic stuff get downvoted to the grave. Maybe of Envy? Extreme standards?
plane-crazy 2020-01-11 13:18:51 as in not counting them as legitimate builds
plane-crazy 2020-01-11 13:18:43 no not that
plane-crazy 2020-01-11 13:18:28 ignoring memes as we know they're jokes
plane-crazy 2020-01-11 13:17:58 after spending time scrolling through the chat, 3 genres of vehicles get the most votes.
Tanks with treads
Trucks (no trailers)
and some large scale destroyer ships
plane-crazy 2020-01-11 13:17:18 Yep. Kinda sad
plane-crazy 2020-01-11 13:16:33 mhmm. Makes no heccin sense
plane-crazy 2020-01-11 13:16:14 ye, but we know those are memes. Not effort based builds. lol
plane-crazy 2020-01-11 13:15:29 ya see so many good builds ranging across skill levels and the way votes go is outrageously damanding lol
plane-crazy 2020-01-11 13:15:00 really have to wonder the purpose of upvotes & downvotes in <#384025409945337856>
plane-crazy 2020-01-10 17:48:00 an someone tell me what the Sparkle Pop is. Isnt it just the sparkler?
plane-crazy 2020-01-02 20:04:12 This will be my 9th mEch i believe
plane-crazy 2020-01-02 20:03:59 Im not a pro-builder, but i'll do my damn best Lad
plane-crazy 2020-01-02 20:03:23 Time to make it a third.
plane-crazy 2020-01-02 20:03:14 Only two C&C builds exist in this game
plane-crazy 2020-01-02 20:01:24 Has anyone ever attempted to build the "Shogun Executioner" from Command & Conquer Red Alert 3?
plane-crazy 2020-01-02 20:00:42 i come to ask a question to big Mech builders out there
plane-crazy 2020-01-02 20:00:29 Hello peoples
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 20:09:22 Motors everywhere, pistons all over the place. Extendo for the world's longest string bean build
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 20:08:53 As long as you can physically make it..
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 19:57:35 but wouldnt you be the same rank?
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 19:50:53 <@!414778672847781888> That flying tank is beautiful
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 18:40:11 but most people wake up 5-7am right?
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 18:38:19 Everyone here registered different AM's & PM's so whats the time zone for that application?
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 18:37:57 what time zone is that morning
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 18:37:52 question
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 18:25:17 ight thanks
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 18:25:02 dw its not staying that color
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 18:24:54 it was changed cos thats the suspension and bit im working on lol
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 18:23:59 need an opinion of the front of the vehicle's cosmetics, and turret design. 
This is my first fold build (7 folds) and those suspensions at the front are yet to be upgraded.
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 18:18:35 thank god they exist
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 18:18:28 Without the use of these beam blocks this would be about 6k blocks and out of its material
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 18:14:27 nice
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 18:14:23 With ballasts and stuff
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 18:14:17 i made a reccomendation or 2
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 18:13:38 dunno how i'd make this hold up without Helium
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 18:13:27 and since this is still my first fold, and i'm not an experienced builder
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 18:13:12 it says no Helium blocks
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 18:13:06 nv
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 18:12:48 no?
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 18:12:42 if i put a second plane on my Amphibious Walking fortress, i could potentially get the Floating Fortress rank
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 18:12:22 also i just realised
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 18:12:03 Gotta earn it lad
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 18:10:39 yep.
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 18:07:46 Seequeen of

plane-crazy 2019-12-29 17:57:01 Nice
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 17:48:17 and you casually explain "So he gave us his location on roblox-"
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 17:48:04 imagine it being some 6 year old
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 17:43:03 F in the chat for this fish
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 17:39:56 after 6 years this site i originally made skins on is still running
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 17:38:47 wait i wonder if the site si still up
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 17:38:37 that be fun
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 17:38:27 tbh i used to be a minecraft skin designer. I should do models on one of my alts
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 17:37:55 Indeed
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 17:37:36 lol
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 17:36:13 ouch
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 17:36:09 and yeah after checing, if i didnt delete by builds , i could've had:
Aero Engi 1,2 & 3
Terrain specialist 1& 2
Ship-wright 1,2
All for submission.
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 17:35:45 Hm.

plane-crazy 2019-12-29 17:34:10 that got 34 upvotes. xD
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 17:32:29 language And ok what is it?
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 17:32:07 lemme list em from memory
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 17:31:46 Tbh i think ima start going for ranks. Especially since i just deleted a bunch of valid builds capable of them
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 17:31:24 hm.
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 17:30:59 ^ Ye pretty much
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 17:30:50 a lot of it goes pretty unfairly to players.
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 17:30:38 when it comes to upvotes and downvotes
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 17:30:33 ngl tho
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 17:28:25 Yep, i did. Much nicer
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 17:28:00 sorry
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 17:27:56 yep i just noted i didnt read the same name lol

plane-crazy 2019-12-29 17:25:52 34 upvotes
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 17:25:49 1 downvote
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 17:25:46 <@!414778672847781888> acoording to the search bar
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 17:22:01 <:bruhaps:646045387911725106>
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 17:21:39 A box indeed
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 17:21:26 a black box.
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 17:21:16 its a box
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 17:21:14 By the looks of it...
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 17:21:02 Oh. That seems to work
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 17:20:39 gotcha
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 17:20:36 Ball Bearings
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 17:20:03 Hm.
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 17:17:14 to make the digit
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 17:17:11 and you add the numbes together
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 17:17:07 2 ballasts
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 17:16:57 <@!467459282250629120> Y'know what that means
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 17:16:34 Rather have gradual pistons, than lots of pistons on multiple binds
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 17:16:15 Ah i get what you mean
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 17:15:25 Would be useful
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 17:14:57 wel, the right adjustestment. Not center
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 17:14:43 I reccoment adding 1 block, and using a ballast to find the center
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 17:14:24 mhm
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 17:12:18 *treel & eerar*
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 17:12:02 GL.
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 17:12:00 welp. Trial & Error lad
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 17:09:54 Hm. I've never thought of anything like that
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 17:09:17 k.
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 17:09:14 o
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 17:09:03 Data?
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 17:07:41 Not all builds are at their best hen we first build em.
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 17:07:27 <@!221496030355521536> Yep.
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 17:06:43 but madattak said
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 17:05:10 i think.
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 17:05:02 Nope No screenshots. F

and ye, ooks alright. Now you need something to coutner helium's push
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 17:04:01 some of my old builds with screenshots are nasty lookin. Aesthetically displeasing.
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 17:03:00 Actually i might y'know. Lemme dig through my backup
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 17:02:38 f
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 17:02:24 Could've had Aero Engi 1,2,3 with my Myrion Spacecraft. 1.6k blocks, no helium (cos i didnt know it existed) and it flew decently well
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 17:00:33 now that i open my eyes a bit. I haven't read the <#609442446249820211> since i joined.
And now that i took a look i realise all the builds i had deleted yesterday for save data were capable of quite a few of those.
*ow*
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 16:58:26 Vtol is different to Hover, no?
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 16:57:55 Millennium Falcon?
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 16:57:22 my word that is likely why none of my planes fly lol
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 16:57:06 for the probable short time I've played plane crazy I've never taken CoT into account. Let alone it's existence until you said that
plane-crazy 2019-12-22 20:38:32 Ima get back to it. Thanks
plane-crazy 2019-12-22 20:38:15 there goes 4 builds around 100 blocks
plane-crazy 2019-12-22 20:37:19 ight.
plane-crazy 2019-12-22 20:37:06 here i am with a 2.5k build and am terrified
plane-crazy 2019-12-22 20:36:57 well scarily enough, all my old ones are about 0-300 blocks cos I never built large things...
plane-crazy 2019-12-22 20:36:31 is there any way i could potentially increase data or?
plane-crazy 2019-12-22 20:36:18 Im working on my first ever fold build, but im bout to surpass my save data limit. And i aint even got started on the main body.
plane-crazy 2019-12-22 20:35:46 ight got a random question here cos I havent done much in PC for months
plane-crazy 2019-12-08 10:01:35 I am commonly known as The Man of Myriad.
I atone for the infinite voices of myself.

Also i play plane crazy
plane-crazy 2019-12-08 10:00:54 Hi lads. It's been a while
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 22:57:47 but this triggers me
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 22:57:44 idk why
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 22:57:41 sorry to barge in randomly  but i made a painful discovery of Delta Control Panels
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 03:58:26 Says he does it for fun.

plane-crazy 2019-09-11 03:57:59 nah seriously.
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 03:57:21 OK - Where do we report creations again? I have forgotten. This dude lagging the server with a million balls.
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 03:55:17 ... k
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 03:53:45 aye small question: Where do you make reports again? I'ts been a while
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 00:41:17 So uh
