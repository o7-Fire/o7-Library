help 2019-03-05 19:08:35 looking at your build now
help 2019-03-05 19:08:56 i think there's too much force for spinning the propellers
help 2019-03-05 19:09:09 creating this uncontrollable effect
help 2019-03-05 19:09:32 that, and a weight distribution

help 2019-03-09 21:48:18 So...
help 2019-03-09 21:48:27 i got back centrifugal force

creations-chat 2019-03-19 17:44:28 my plane however has an issue of inverting its wings. The little control things are too weak tbh so i used motors and plane panels.
creations-chat 2019-03-19 17:44:44 the motors dont reset fully. so they invert.

help 2019-03-28 21:58:23 Neato. its my third build so im going all out.
help 2019-03-29 16:02:54 Alright... so i have an issue
help 2019-03-29 16:03:48 i have this build which is meant to be a compactable aircraft, which i'll later develop into a mecha-airplane transformer.
help 2019-03-29 16:04:01 Problem is i cant get a good mechanism to deploy the wings.
help 2019-03-29 16:04:07 this is the compact mode.
help 2019-03-29 16:04:07 
help 2019-03-29 16:05:05 i tried deploying the wings and it seems to break every time despite having clearance
help 2019-03-29 16:05:19 
help 2019-03-29 16:05:33 alright.
help 2019-03-29 16:05:45 on the plus side
help 2019-03-29 16:06:47 emergency parachutes work like a charm.
help 2019-03-29 16:06:54 
help 2019-03-29 16:07:16 it also has a handy 'weight reduction feature.'
help 2019-03-29 16:07:31 
help 2019-03-29 16:07:34 heh
help 2019-03-29 16:10:18 ah
help 2019-03-29 16:10:38 i think i've realised why this wont fly
help 2019-03-29 16:10:56 i think its because center of lift doesnt change even if you move the wings.
help 2019-03-29 16:11:12 hm
help 2019-03-29 16:11:20 i need a fix for this. Not sure what to do then
help 2019-03-29 16:22:12 how do i fix this??
help 2019-03-29 16:22:19 motors keep goofing up

help 2019-03-29 18:34:55 
help 2019-03-29 18:45:54 so it has one issue
help 2019-03-29 18:46:01 cant get lift & i cant find the center of lift either
help 2019-03-29 18:49:07 it just needs LOADS of speed
help 2019-03-29 18:49:07 it flies now.
help 2019-03-29 18:49:20 i took 6 super rockets to even get it to start moving an inch.
help 2019-03-29 18:49:24 jesus
help 2019-03-29 18:50:09 Eject worked beautifully though
help 2019-03-29 18:50:15 
help 2019-03-29 18:54:23 this is what it takes to get lift. Jesus.
Any way i can reduce this at all?
help 2019-03-29 18:54:59 nvm even with this it cant lift
help 2019-03-29 18:55:08 i need to add more controls maybe.
help 2019-03-29 18:55:22 could helium blocks reduce weight?
help 2019-03-29 18:55:24 hm
help 2019-03-29 18:56:04 lets see what 6 helium blocks can do.
help 2019-03-29 18:57:58 ah, i forgot. It has 2 flight modes. In Flight mode 2 it can get lift, but not enough. 
Flight 1 & 2 spread the boost & a lil bit of magic inside that adjusts weight
help 2019-03-29 18:58:08 i need flight 1 to take off however.
help 2019-03-29 18:58:32 This is flight mode 1
help 2019-03-29 18:59:04 square arrangement, weight is put forward to back (only cos i need to build the front still)
help 2019-03-29 18:59:28 Flight mode 2
help 2019-03-29 18:59:38 Spread out the boost & can freely eject passenger section if needed.
help 2019-03-29 18:59:57 despite this, how do i get lift on this design. It cant seem to get any.
help 2019-03-29 19:08:27 ah, nvm. I got it
help 2019-03-29 19:08:56 it can fly!
help 2019-03-29 19:09:03 well.. kinda
help 2019-03-29 19:09:28 i need more wing panels i believe
help 2019-03-29 19:16:26 Alright im back
help 2019-03-29 19:16:45 new developments show over the past 8 minutes i added elevation and completed passenger section
help 2019-03-29 19:16:54 Added new wings for lift, but it needs more boost now.
help 2019-03-29 19:16:59 
help 2019-03-29 19:17:08 i plan to install the boost on the front carriage.
help 2019-03-29 19:17:19 this will even out the mass and hopefully fix the lift issue too

help 2019-03-29 22:20:13 y'know, tryin to use this monotone color scheme is a pain
help 2019-03-29 22:20:53 i wish there was a button or something in the settings you could press for an outline over every corner of all the blocks so i could make sense of what im looking at
help 2019-03-29 22:21:05 kinda like how Crossout & Robocraft have it

Features:
Seats 20+
Water entrance hatch which doubles as a platform when horizontal (with deploy-able railings)
Opening walls to  let in the sunshine, also with deployable railings (trapdoors are great :3)
180* Rotating Turret w/ Spotlight

Planned to feature:
More defenses, Perhaps a deploy-able aquarium for passengers to enter & see the fishies :3
Pilot's Room.
More seats :D
Perhaps one of those folds people use for large builds.
creations-chat 2019-04-06 09:07:06 people in server dont like my trapdoor railings, apparently i should be using half blocks.
creations-chat 2019-04-06 09:20:49 hm, i used trapdoors cos that can fold up so the inside & outside dont look all blocker & mishapen.
creations-chat 2019-04-06 09:21:07 thats why im a little resilient to use Half-blocks :P

creations-chat 2019-09-07 00:13:33 Celebrating my return to plane crazy after a few months break, i give you:
A boat. 
Yep. Not much special to it. Borrowed the model of the Myrion Cruiser's base & did a lot of remodeling, so the boat actually floats now instead of either launching into the atmosphere or spinning upside down.

Name? Lets go with...  - Redruth 9 . 

Features:
Fully functional forward thrust & turning. As with all boats.
360* Rotating Machine gun mounted on the front deck.
Also on the deck, a deploy-able rocket launcher.
In the cabin, you have a computer & table, while the captains area is closed off below.
At the back of the boat, 360* Cosmetic Cannon with raise / lower aiming stability. 
The Captains area has a 'secret' escape pod the players in game dubbed, *'The Smolmarine'*

Also motor 2 is neat
help 2019-09-11 00:42:53 (also motor 2 is pretty wack & likes to dance on it's own.)

help 2019-09-11 00:47:11 Allow me to demonstrate the design im attempting as it's very basic.

Motor |block| Motor 
.            Motor 

Top 2 motors are for vertical rotation holding up 2 30-block ish rocket launchers, while the bottom motor is a 360* platform for horizontal rotation. The vertical Motors seem to .... break upon use.

help 2019-12-23 22:03:58 btw we're talking 3.5k Blocks (will be around double by the time the build is complete) While also using crap tons of helium and weight reduction.
I'm kinda new to suspensions, and these Tutorial ones aint holding up.

help 2019-12-23 22:05:44 Nice. This is actually my first fold build too. Good luck with that
help 2019-12-23 22:06:31 My Pc crashes just from unfolding this thing.
help 2019-12-23 22:06:40 Sometimes the suspensions freak out and i get launched into the abyss
help 2019-12-23 22:06:59 Without the exterior parts, the frame itself with the suspensions is all terrain
help 2019-12-23 22:07:01 even amphibious
help 2019-12-23 22:07:11 But... now with the exterior in progress
help 2019-12-23 22:07:18 doesnt hold up, no matter how i edit the things
help 2019-12-23 22:07:35 That be great. In game or in images?
help 2019-12-23 22:07:45 i'd rather images

help 2019-12-23 22:17:02 Oof.
help 2019-12-23 22:24:12 Thats fine.. but i wouldnt say this is 'tiny'
help 2019-12-23 22:24:37 more like... compensating for my lack of engineering skill.
help 2019-12-23 22:24:40 idk
help 2019-12-23 22:26:17 Good idea
help 2019-12-23 22:26:38 wouldnt be able to copy anyway without configs.
help 2019-12-23 22:27:15 I was using a Yotube Tutorial. I've neer built a suspension before
help 2019-12-23 22:27:20 i tried 2: Right Angle lever
help 2019-12-23 22:27:26 and that stick one
help 2019-12-23 22:27:33 neither have the strength to hold up this build.
help 2019-12-23 22:28:00 tbh i dont want to sacrifice the all terrain aspect... but the builds too damn big for a normal suspension. Or so i think
help 2019-12-23 22:28:49 *Cries in 300 helium blocks*
help 2019-12-23 22:29:24 issue with that however, going over bumps may cause it to acsend into the heavens... and crash my game. has done before. So i try to avoid using too much.
help 2019-12-23 22:30:23 Motor 2's have caused my life to go from Uneventful to leaping off a cliff and nothing happening.
So... no.
help 2019-12-23 22:30:33 actuall incorrect
help 2019-12-23 22:30:41 i have got Motor 2's for steering
help 2019-12-23 22:30:58 aaannd thats cos the current suspension is from a YT tutorial
help 2019-12-23 22:31:24 mhmm
help 2019-12-23 22:31:29 
help 2019-12-23 22:31:30 This is what i currently have
help 2019-12-23 22:31:36 Basic, maybe too small
help 2019-12-23 22:32:37 Maybe. I have a series of suspensions holding each of those struts out, trying to compensate some of the space.
help 2019-12-23 22:32:53 i dont know how to build an effective suspension, so I tried to make up for it
help 2019-12-23 22:33:13 Without the exterior, very effective
help 2019-12-23 22:33:21 with additions to the frame... *pancake*
help 2019-12-23 22:33:57 Nor do i tbh. May have to start toying with suspensions and such on one of my alts
help 2019-12-23 22:34:12 ive sacrificed all my old (crap) builds on this ACC for this build
help 2019-12-23 22:34:23 yet i fear there isnt enough save data for it...
help 2019-12-23 22:35:16 <@!415036739653074944> Do you know anything about suspension configs? What each setting does?
help 2019-12-23 22:36:37 Can you explain 'damps'?
help 2019-12-23 22:36:47 o
help 2019-12-23 22:36:59 i have no idea what that symbolises
help 2019-12-23 22:37:41 So if i max out damping, it would be able to cancel out more weight?
help 2019-12-23 22:37:44 on lets say
help 2019-12-23 22:38:17 This kinda part?
help 2019-12-23 22:38:45 allows the struts the lift and adapt with the front suspensions for all terrain travel.
help 2019-12-23 22:39:02 Without them, the chassis would never move with the suspension.
help 2019-12-23 22:39:12 And would get stuck on small bumps and such
help 2019-12-23 22:40:06 Ight I'll report back what changes
help 2019-12-23 22:40:21 if i dont report back within 10 minutes the entire computer crashed

help 2019-12-23 22:44:56 
help 2019-12-23 22:44:57 it has changes the effects
help 2019-12-23 22:45:01 If im right
help 2019-12-23 22:45:11 if i up the damping on the side suspensions
help 2019-12-23 22:45:32 it can potentially prevent the wheel struts from being forced up lik that
help 2019-12-23 22:45:55 hold it
help 2019-12-23 22:46:00 
help 2019-12-23 22:46:06 it went nuclear while i wasnt looking
help 2019-12-23 22:46:15 normally happens when i mess with the suspensions
help 2019-12-23 22:48:42 welp.

help 2020-01-02 20:05:52 My next project to continue learning the Mechanics of Mechs and big builds with motors galore
help 2020-01-02 20:06:11 involves a terrifying appearance ima need to replicate somehow to some stability.
help 2020-01-02 20:06:35 This...
help 2020-01-02 20:06:41 Is the shogun Executioner from Command and Conquer Red Alert 3
help 2020-01-02 20:06:56 A 3 Legged, Giant robot with 3 sides, each with its own torso, body and head
help 2020-01-02 20:07:21 Now, 2 sides i can do. But i am entirely unsure how to create a 3 way baseplate
help 2020-01-02 20:07:58 \     /
    |

That is the kind of shape i need
help 2020-01-02 20:08:06 Any suggestions?
help 2020-01-02 20:15:42 -
my current idea (on a small-scale test model) is to use lock motors on max torque.

If the weight becomes much, i can use ropes to hault it around and keep it in space... i think. Not sure bout that second part.
help 2020-01-02 20:16:34 Bit like this
help 2020-01-02 20:16:38 
help 2020-01-02 20:16:52 uncropped cos meh
But this may work for the small scale model
help 2020-01-02 20:18:36 . Meh lock motors still disconnect and do weird stuff still. So no lock.
help 2020-01-02 20:24:36 In my experience, use a lot of "Wedge 2" menu for the front and back of the boat, having some kind of curvature while keeping some flat body for the game physics.
help 2020-01-02 20:25:06 on the left & right of the boat's bottom bit, use a line of ballasts for Balance and prevent listing
help 2020-01-02 20:25:22 the top is kinda up to you honestly. Im not the most experienced 'Boat-ist'
help 2020-01-02 20:29:02 you can kinda use Signs and copypasta emojis i guess. But thats about all i know
help 2020-01-02 20:32:35 Eh, i think so. Ive seen people use flags and stuff in signs
help 2020-01-02 20:34:40 Back on my Shogun Executioner, my test 3-torso Skeleton kinda has a shape to it
help 2020-01-02 20:35:17 i normally use Helium, Wing panels and unpowered motors for mechs, as i was taught. But... I may need to learn a new method of mech design for these legs
help 2020-01-02 20:57:59 First skeleton of the 3 Torso part. Still cracking out a few errors. But it has the potential for use into the large scale model. 

Any thoughts?
help 2020-01-02 20:59:03 Ive decides to kinda have a 'false' hold on the sword, with only one arm. As i let it unfold (due to being a small scale model)
help 2020-01-02 20:59:12 The larger model wont need this.
help 2020-01-02 21:04:17 K so it turns out if you have more than 4-5 motors all on the same keybind button they dont work
help 2020-01-02 21:04:32 ...which kinda sucks for the design.
help 2020-01-02 21:05:48 nvm im just an idiot who placed a block incorrectly
help 2020-01-02 21:21:18 -
Added the legs, anyone to give thoughts? Using the current method of mech design i know for now. I'll have to make a new method once it makes

help 2020-01-02 21:38:33 If you wanna make an instrument
help 2020-01-02 21:38:37 use Snow blasters
help 2020-01-02 21:38:45 they sound like microwaves, a HUMMMM
help 2020-01-02 21:39:15 so if you have a point you stand, and a line of snow blasters, with different engines by them
help 2020-01-02 21:39:23 you can kinda mimic sounds? Idk
help 2020-01-02 21:39:26 best i can do lol
help 2020-01-02 21:53:03 aint terrain specialist the thing for rough terrain travel?
help 2020-01-02 21:54:00 .
help 2020-01-02 21:54:08 wait so all you need for it is to drive?
help 2020-01-02 21:55:12 so potentially my 4.5k 7 fold walking fortress can technically clear the entire terrain specialist chart?
help 2020-01-02 21:55:44 meh i'll submit its final version when its done
help 2020-01-02 21:56:14 Noice. Cos i cant do tracks, it indeed uses wheels.
help 2020-01-02 21:56:43 and since ima have to remodel it's suspensions for the massive weight... ye may take a while

help 2020-01-05 21:13:23 Hello again. Im here often arent i?
ight, im looking for the rare bundle of joy that is the builders who have some kind of 'Tripedal walker' frame. my current model proves as an absolute negative. And since i haven't got much experience with anything more than 2 legs.
help 2020-01-05 21:14:17 my current issue is designing something that doesn't bring the entire build along with it, and drags everything else. Perhaps i just need more weight on the feet to hold it down, or perhaps something else in the model.
help 2020-01-05 21:15:17 This is the current prototype skeleton design for a small scale 'Shogun Executioner'
help 2020-01-05 21:15:23 and this is also my first ever attempt at a Tripedal walker.
help 2020-01-05 21:15:33 anyone got an idea?
help 2020-01-06 10:40:56 Ladies and gentlemen
help 2020-01-06 10:41:05 **it walks**
help 2020-01-06 10:41:27 I have created a functional Tripedal walker. Now i just need to finish the skeleton
help 2020-01-06 10:41:41 then i can work on the large-scale fold build for the actual creation
help 2020-01-06 10:46:17 it certinaly aint perfect, but it walks easily
help 2020-01-06 19:49:27 Indeed!
help 2020-01-06 19:49:40 The Shogun Executioner, build by the rising Sun for Operation Odessa
help 2020-01-06 19:50:11 I plan to make a large scale build of it
help 2020-01-06 19:51:11 Hm
help 2020-01-06 19:51:18 rockets eh>
help 2020-01-06 19:51:25 is that one of those Motor 2 guided ones?
help 2020-01-06 19:52:56 hm. Ive never attempted one of those.
help 2020-01-06 19:53:33 lol
help 2020-01-06 19:53:45 i take no offence.
help 2020-01-06 19:57:22 <@!415036739653074944> i reccomend you dont judge someone for their ranks.
help 2020-01-06 19:58:24 lol. Tis the purpose of the channel.
help 2020-01-06 19:58:50 well. Back on track with the motor 2 things
help 2020-01-06 19:59:06 how does it work?
help 2020-01-06 19:59:23 ok, but it also follows your camera center
help 2020-01-06 19:59:25 no?
help 2020-01-06 19:59:40 you point it somewhere, then turn the camera that is a completely different angle of approach
help 2020-01-06 20:00:33 alright
help 2020-01-06 20:00:59 ive done manual missiles before, but not guided. if i had to make a guess
help 2020-01-06 20:01:32 perhaps install a position based camera
help 2020-01-06 20:01:43 so you swap to a camera, specifically for guiding that missile
help 2020-01-06 20:01:50 depending on the angle you want to fire at?
help 2020-01-06 20:02:39 fair enough
help 2020-01-06 20:02:42 but one issue
help 2020-01-06 20:02:56 wait

help 2020-01-07 16:49:35 You'll need to have some way of turning a single rotor. its gonna make the rotors look very clunky and less appearling
help 2020-01-07 16:50:16 If anything
help 2020-01-07 16:50:29 you could compromise. But then its just... eh
help 2020-01-07 16:50:42 eh. One day we'll have diagonal block placements.
creations-chat 2020-01-10 17:33:33 ``` ```
Giving an update on the Armata Overlord. last time i posted it in this chat, it was a frame! Now it has this 'Ender Dragon' style design (as everyone i meet calls it) and has about 8 layers of diamond plating all around the front.

The build is half complete and i had to replace about a thousand or so slate blocks with beams. 

Unfold time: 40 - 50 Seconds
Weapons: 
**Twin barrel cannon (cosmetic)** 
 mounted rocket launcher (on top these cannons)
Overall cosmetic, ineffective weapon. Might replace in future.

**'Prominence Cannon'** 
4 barrel rotating minigun. 
Can swap between focused aim & large spread. 
Highly effective against heavy & low armour, as well as light aircraft.

**to be added weapons:**
4x Machineguns, one per suspension strut.
2x Firework Launchers. Ideal for close range, mounted at the rear.

**Current Features**
Fully active lights
All terrain land with a top speed of... 5mph
 (With BOOST System: 850mph -ish.)
Fully Amphibious mobility, top speed 25. 
(With BOOST System: DO NOT USE. Kinda turns it into a submarine without mobility...)

**Planned features**
2x Deployable Micro-Aircraft (Manual controlled)
1x Deployable Escape Submarine
1x Emergency flare system.
Moar Lights
Moar Smoke
New suspension System and some way to armour it up.

Will complete this soon, and oh boi it will be chonky with the rank potential. Thanks for reading!
help 2020-01-10 17:41:13 im lookin for a dude who can make a super heavyweight suspension. I am crap with suspensions and would like some insight to how they work.
help 2020-01-10 17:42:01 and by super heavyweight i mean about 4.5k blocks with supported by around 150 heliums.
creations-chat 2020-01-10 18:39:24 Yall wanna go Skiing in my Ski-Bot?
:3
Its fun to dance around on the ice with this thing.
creations-chat 2020-01-10 18:40:02 Block count
creations-chat 2020-01-10 18:50:30 Indeed lad. Glad i could make that dream true
creations-chat 2020-01-10 18:51:00 tbh if you use Skis on any kinda mech your only hope is a flat surface, Hence i build an ice skater.
creations-chat 2020-03-02 12:41:49 *Dont mind me im just taking my boat for a walk~*
help 2020-05-08 14:42:31 Dear Suspension Gods. I request your guidance.

A forever ago i submitted this bad buy to the Creations chat, then proceeded to spend a month trying to create a suitable set of compact suspensions to raise the Mobile Fortress off the ground. I dropped it since I have no brain for it.

Picking it back up in 2020, I really need help finding a better suspension.
help 2020-05-08 14:43:05 Here is the current suspension i have
help 2020-05-08 14:43:39 Standard Youtube tutorial stuff. 
however, despite as many tweaks i can make, it's impossible to hold up a build over 6k blocks in weight.
help 2020-05-08 14:44:02 if you give me a moment to unfold it, i'll present the effect and system currently in place
help 2020-05-08 14:48:06 After crashing my roblox, here is it after the Overlord is unfolded, all clamps are locked and supports removed.
help 2020-05-08 14:48:29 The system uses a strut to connect the outward 'Treads' to the main build
help 2020-05-08 14:49:45 The strut has 3 suspensions attatched to the ceiling within the build, this is done since attempted with the opposite idea failed to drive. The Suspensions constantly... suspend from being pulled rather than crushed.
help 2020-05-08 14:50:08 They extend out about 8-12 blocks, and are latched on top the suspensions.
help 2020-05-08 14:51:13 The suspensions that hold up the strut are pretty standard, I am unsure how their physics work.
help 2020-05-08 14:51:55 
help 2020-05-08 14:52:20 Would any suspension professional know how to fix this problem?
help 2020-05-08 14:57:37 I've modifed suspensions to 60 damping and added extra 5x5 wheels to make wheels larger
help 2020-05-08 14:57:43 No effect
help 2020-05-08 15:02:10 I will alter the Suspensions now.
help 2020-05-08 15:02:26 Though i am considering completely new systems for the 'treads' themselves
help 2020-05-08 15:02:59 Alright, doing a test run
help 2020-05-08 15:03:16 I've set the Rear suspensions to the maxs, and front at just above half.
help 2020-05-08 15:03:22 Since the rear carries more weight
help 2020-05-08 15:09:40 I feel like my private server is about to commit seppeku
help 2020-05-08 15:10:52 Unfolded
Clamps locked
Releasing Supports
help 2020-05-08 15:11:24 <@!454570394343702529> Your suggestions have seemed to work incredibly well.
help 2020-05-08 15:11:34 "When in doubt."
"Max it out"
help 2020-05-08 15:13:13 Unfortunately it still isn't enough to hold up the heccin thing so ima add more suspensions
help 2020-05-08 15:13:25 <@!409676438682206218> Do you know any alternatives to replace this unusable YT tutorial suspension?
help 2020-05-08 15:13:53 And i am currently in a Private Server since this thing is no stranger to making people complain and their PCs dying
help 2020-05-08 15:14:39 like this one

help 2020-05-08 15:52:10 <@!409676438682206218> so my computer might have imploded again
help 2020-05-08 15:53:39 Joinng you
help 2020-05-08 16:17:09 I didnt notice they doubled block counts
help 2020-05-08 16:17:21 i have another 2k slate blocks at my disposal now
help 2020-05-08 16:32:12 Looks about right. I'm not a boat designer, but it looks good
help 2020-05-08 16:32:14 nice pfp btw
help 2020-05-09 09:06:55 <@!409676438682206218> Yo, you available atm? My Screenshots can't see a part of the build and my attempts continue to... not work. Do you still have the suspension saved so i can check?
creations-chat 2020-07-15 20:52:50 ``` Monochromatic Assault Mech V1 ```
its been a while since I've posted here... good few months. Here's something I spent the last 3 days on.

I wanted to build another mech, with PVP intent. 

The Monochromatic assault mech was very fun to design, taking a cockpit over a head & camera setup as well as some new attempts at some weapons, like a Magnetic Launcher.

The struts are for access from ground (ladders) and to prevent it from doing anything stupid when it spawns. Like having a seizure and disappearing.

The Version 1 conclusion? Disappointing. The structure simply wasn't going to take to Bipedal waking. It ends up hovering & floating at awkward angles if you overstep, which is no fun.

Fortunately I have a solution, and will reveal V2 upon the completion of a new set of legs to take the weight. Cheers!
creations-chat 2020-07-15 20:53:13 wait hold on

Not true, i've made other creation submissions. Such as the Armata Overlord progressions & older creations, such as the Myrion Cruiser & that one crappy boat when i started plane Crazy.

Channels must've been wiped at some point.

creations-chat 2020-07-15 21:17:55 Ight, dont need to ping for that.
creations-chat 2020-07-16 07:29:26 one bladed? So, a single propeller?
creations-chat 2020-07-16 07:29:38 or one level of propeller blades
creations-chat 2020-07-16 07:35:42 <@!688971608970625025> Yo. Im very fond of that compact Heli, didnt know you could get em that small.

One of my projects is a Mobile Fortress with a few deployable drones / vehicles and I originally was going to use small planes on a sling.

Could we Dm later? Im really interested to see how you built it, as I wanna incorporate it into the Amarta Overlord's arsenal. 1 drone & 1 Heli would be amazing over 2 small drones!
creations-chat 2020-07-16 07:36:42 Im also wondering if its possible to weaponise it :3
creations-chat 2020-07-16 07:37:29 Ooo, do share if possible. Never built many Helis so my curiosity is triggered
creations-chat 2020-07-16 07:37:52 Only working heli i have kinda cheats the system as its also a transforming mecha
creations-chat 2020-07-16 07:38:38 I, dont know that terminology. But i assume it can hover and balance well by what you're saying
creations-chat 2020-07-16 07:39:37 I dont see why not.
creations-chat 2020-07-16 07:44:00 Looks good. But im afriad the rotors are too wide to be stored in the Amarta
creations-chat 2020-07-16 07:44:08 Well heccin done tho
creations-chat 2020-07-16 07:46:15 Say, how did you design the rotors up top? I see two, and i imagine they spin in such a way they never collide to allow stable flight?
creations-chat 2020-07-16 07:46:44 Servos?
creations-chat 2020-07-16 07:46:52 Nice.
creations-chat 2020-07-16 07:47:44 Do you think its possible to enlarge the rotor design & potentially allow for a 'folded up' storage mode for them? I feel like i can slap that kinda system on another mech 👀
creations-chat 2020-07-16 07:48:09 i just made some new omnidirectional legs, they are s m o o t h for walking
creations-chat 2020-07-16 07:48:27 Fully bipedal and are a charm. Combine that with a flight ability?
creations-chat 2020-07-16 07:48:30 Oh i'll die for it
creations-chat 2020-07-16 07:49:25 Gotcha. I only got above 30 when im trying to make rotary weapons or stupid crap lol
creations-chat 2020-07-16 07:50:08 uncropped cos lazy, WIP Monochromatic Assault Bot (V2)

creations-chat 2020-07-16 08:16:04 oh, <@!608204785384030208> Does your rotor system work off an odd / even center?
creations-chat 2020-07-16 08:16:21 aka, a 7 block wide build with a middle point or a 6 block with 2 center blocks
creations-chat 2020-07-16 08:16:40 oh hey the armata is in there lol
creations-chat 2020-07-16 08:16:44 the V1 at least
creations-chat 2020-07-16 08:35:09 It was to be compact to put on structure buildings that are downscaled
creations-chat 2020-07-16 08:35:14 and, its pretty cool.

creations-chat 2020-07-16 18:45:33 theres Ballast-Helium ribcages which was taught to me
There's the rocket foot ones that hold the mech down & allow feet to lift & slide.
There are legs with manual motor control
creations-chat 2020-07-16 18:45:53 And then there are Sliders, where they dont really lift the foot and glide
creations-chat 2020-07-16 18:46:09 Yep

creations-chat 2020-07-16 18:52:53 are those engines disabled for cosmetic use?

creations-chat 2020-07-16 19:07:34 
creations-chat 2020-07-16 19:08:01 I think i can use this as an inspiration to add fishermen torsos to each side, creating a litteral multi-mecha fishing platform
creations-chat 2020-07-16 19:08:21 "Multi-Mecha Fishing platform" You will **never** see another player build this i tell ya lol

creations-chat 2020-07-16 19:21:53 1.5k will likely be the legs itself
creations-chat 2020-07-16 19:26:00 actually
creations-chat 2020-07-16 19:26:13 if the Monochromatic Assault bot was 1k in its two legs

creations-chat 2020-07-16 19:49:07 I can imagine only one way for it to work tho
creations-chat 2020-07-16 19:49:20 and it'll be a lot of conveyors and more magnets
creations-chat 2020-07-16 19:49:34 is the hull hollow?
creations-chat 2020-07-16 19:49:46 the uh... bottom bit

creations-chat 2020-07-16 20:05:03 thats bigger than the current Armata overlord, which had to be massively compressed into beam blocks cos of block count and stands at 4k
creations-chat 2020-07-16 20:05:31 What is the biggest build ever made in plane crazy history?

creations-chat 2020-07-16 20:22:21 I know a fix however
creations-chat 2020-07-16 20:22:25 but you wont like it
creations-chat 2020-07-16 20:22:53 Take 2 motors and put them opposite sides on the ends of a stick
creations-chat 2020-07-16 20:23:28 you use one motor to move the stick manually & slowly till its lined up in center, then the other motor keeps your turret stable
creations-chat 2020-07-16 20:23:54 it sounds terrible ( and it is ) but its the only way i know to counterpoint a build with no middle beam
creations-chat 2020-07-16 20:24:20 (half-block motors could exist one day to fix that)
creations-chat 2020-07-16 20:26:26 ight

creations-chat 2020-07-17 16:36:18 For you fishing / boat specialists out there, what kind of equipment do fishing boats have?
creations-chat 2020-07-17 17:35:31 *The power of the wedge blocks compels you*
creations-chat 2020-07-17 17:37:43 wow you really are stuk-

creations-chat 2020-07-17 19:01:56 Anyway we've broke 3.8k blocks and have started 100% progress on Mech Chassis
creations-chat 2020-07-17 19:04:23 Coming along well
creations-chat 2020-07-17 19:05:14 Это на самом деле рыболовный робот
creations-chat 2020-07-17 19:16:27 I mean
creations-chat 2020-07-17 19:16:41 I dont mind other languages and i checked rules, maybe i missed 'english only;
creations-chat 2020-07-17 19:16:56 but not everyone knows english. And google translate handled my lil conversation like a dream
creations-chat 2020-07-17 19:17:06 Other languages are cool.
creations-chat 2020-07-17 19:17:31 Well if we get warned for tAlKiNg then whoop de doo.
creations-chat 2020-07-17 19:17:38 I'll just continue building
creations-chat 2020-07-17 19:18:01 Speaking of, just slapped another 24 props to the legs to walk better
creations-chat 2020-07-17 19:18:52 yeesh... its getting hard to make it walk
creations-chat 2020-07-17 19:19:03 one of these motors refuses to work
creations-chat 2020-07-17 19:21:25 just detatched 4 legs on one side
creations-chat 2020-07-17 19:21:33 even without those legs it stands. Excellent stability
creations-chat 2020-07-17 19:24:55 its weird
creations-chat 2020-07-17 19:25:03 my unpowered motors
creations-chat 2020-07-17 19:25:07 just dont turn anymore
creations-chat 2020-07-17 19:28:52 the more i try to edit this
creations-chat 2020-07-17 19:28:57 the harder it becomes to walk
creations-chat 2020-07-17 19:29:07 I should've made these legs longer...
creations-chat 2020-07-17 19:31:00 eee
creations-chat 2020-07-17 19:37:30 its the knees
creations-chat 2020-07-17 19:37:37 the uh
creations-chat 2020-07-17 19:37:39 upper knees
creations-chat 2020-07-17 19:37:52 they're messing up the legs walkin ability cos of the motor connections
creations-chat 2020-07-17 19:39:28 The use of ropes to help seems valid
creations-chat 2020-07-17 19:43:10 an additional 175 block have been added to try and improve walking
creations-chat 2020-07-17 19:43:13 y e e s h
creations-chat 2020-07-17 19:43:51 I think i've generally used the wrong leg model for this to walk...
creations-chat 2020-07-17 19:43:55 sure, it can move
creations-chat 2020-07-17 19:43:58 but its under 1mph
creations-chat 2020-07-17 19:44:41 my old Leg model for an AT-AT walker would've been more suited
creations-chat 2020-07-17 19:45:23 ...
creations-chat 2020-07-17 19:45:26 nope, new issue
creations-chat 2020-07-17 19:45:35 Legs used to walk forward are making it turn backwards
creations-chat 2020-07-17 19:45:38 w a t
creations-chat 2020-07-17 19:47:31 This might be doomed for Land walking
creations-chat 2020-07-17 19:47:39 but it still functions in water... and *technically* walks
creations-chat 2020-07-17 19:48:16 hm... with this it wouldnt work for the contest
creations-chat 2020-07-17 19:48:38 i dont see a way to fix it either
creations-chat 2020-07-17 19:49:57 I might have to restart
creations-chat 2020-07-17 19:51:13 Hecc the legs. If it walks at 1mph it walks at 1mph
creations-chat 2020-07-17 19:54:29 **New top speed achieved: 3mph**
creations-chat 2020-07-17 19:56:00 The Platform can paddle / swim with its legs at 10-15 mph
creations-chat 2020-07-17 19:56:19 which is good as its meant to be in the water, land is just cos of legs
creations-chat 2020-07-17 19:59:02 **Yesh**
creations-chat 2020-07-17 19:59:13 Now i gotta build the mech bodies
creations-chat 2020-07-17 19:59:25 then modify the legs again for an additionally 1k blocks or so in weight
creations-chat 2020-07-17 19:59:37 then add the equipment being: Fishing lines, Nets & cages
creations-chat 2020-07-17 20:09:52 3768 blocks in... 100% will break 4k blocks. Maybe even skim 5k
creations-chat 2020-07-17 20:12:10 Y'think someone has build the SCP version of the Bismark before?
creations-chat 2020-07-17 20:13:02 What about the Japanese Submersible Aircraft Carrier?
creations-chat 2020-07-17 20:13:05 from WW2?
creations-chat 2020-07-17 20:13:13 Only 5 were ever built
creations-chat 2020-07-17 20:13:33 Even with the slingshot & Folding aircraft?
creations-chat 2020-07-17 20:13:46 Hmm
creations-chat 2020-07-17 20:13:53 What about some Space Battleship Yamato builds?
creations-chat 2020-07-17 20:14:06 I'd love to see someone try and build the Polmeria or Portent of Darkness
creations-chat 2020-07-17 20:15:01 ooo
creations-chat 2020-07-17 20:15:15 I'll hunt it down later
creations-chat 2020-07-17 20:15:25 What about walkers? Not many people build em
creations-chat 2020-07-17 20:15:35 Anyone ever done a fully functional Octopedal walker before?
creations-chat 2020-07-17 20:16:03 Ive done Bipedal, Tripedal, Quadruped & I *had* a quintuped but its gone
creations-chat 2020-07-18 09:13:50 Rear Mech chassis, working on a Trawling Net
creations-chat 2020-07-18 09:14:13 
creations-chat 2020-07-18 09:15:21 
creations-chat 2020-07-18 09:15:51 Was gifted a nice screenshot of a net by Galaxy a while back, but i go no heccin clue where he put the magnets & which orientation it was
creations-chat 2020-07-18 09:16:03 so uh, anyone know how to build a net?
creations-chat 2020-07-18 09:25:03 <@!535743883565596672> Awesome Mecha transformer lad
creations-chat 2020-07-18 09:25:12 I couldnt get a plane to work, but got a Heli working
creations-chat 2020-07-18 09:30:29 All fixable. Too me a couple days to make the Heli 'Stable' and it still spins if left unchecked
creations-chat 2020-07-18 09:30:34 bet you can do it
creations-chat 2020-07-18 09:35:46 Ah alright
creations-chat 2020-07-20 13:13:02 Hell. Im behind on the build now
creations-chat 2020-07-20 13:13:05 contest expires tomorrow
creations-chat 2020-07-20 13:13:19 tis what I get for not building for a day
creations-chat 2020-07-20 13:13:30 better finish it off, net or no net.
creations-chat 2020-07-20 13:29:19 Ngl it be pretty cool, as there really are no defense blocks in plane crazy apart from the Water Jets
creations-chat 2020-07-20 13:29:44 Shield Generators could be outfitted to counter basic Guns & used against brick builders >.>
creations-chat 2020-07-20 13:30:20 I can see it as, Using 'Config' on the generator and clicking a lil button to place the shield blocks that toggle on and off
creations-chat 2020-07-20 13:30:56 this can be used in many other builds as a space saver & space filler, for example: A bridge for a spacecraft
creations-chat 2020-07-20 13:31:07 A little toggle for a platform
creations-chat 2020-07-20 13:31:13 A shield for a Mech Knight
creations-chat 2020-07-20 13:31:35 Tbh i've never seen cutter blocks do anything  unless they're strapped for a crap ton of supers
creations-chat 2020-07-20 13:32:25 Selective building can exist, a way to grade the amount of weapons you can actively use in PVP if a shield is equipped? Or perhaps the use of Fuel / A battery
creations-chat 2020-07-20 13:32:40 Destroy the battery, No more shield
creations-chat 2020-07-20 13:33:06 All this is thought on the spot. Would need a lot more thought
creations-chat 2020-07-20 13:33:18 **.**
creations-chat 2020-07-20 13:33:34 Takes more than 1 block to make a wheel work
creations-chat 2020-07-20 13:34:19 right, but its all bout the freedom of construction. Having the battery idea would inspire some more smart builds
creations-chat 2020-07-20 13:34:34 as well as some greater targetting control for pvp
creations-chat 2020-07-20 13:34:45 Instead of **spray everything**
creations-chat 2020-07-20 13:34:54 ye
creations-chat 2020-07-20 13:35:05 ...wat

help 2020-07-24 05:06:58 your thinking of Round Wedges
help 2020-07-24 05:07:05 they're too large to be round wedges
help 2020-07-24 05:07:21 we're certain they're 3x3 Cylinders
help 2020-07-24 05:43:17 **alright**
help 2020-07-24 05:43:26 Serious talk. Serious building time
help 2020-07-24 05:44:18 Shredder bugs. F# them all and everyone who uses them to ruin pvp servers.

I want to find a way to make a complete counter to Shredder Bugs, so we can share it and let the counter spread to kill the bug
help 2020-07-24 05:44:53 By the looks of it, They spin cutters fast & ram headfirst
help 2020-07-24 05:45:18 i got the idea of a small, fast spinning Gyrosphere aircraft from a recent creation in <#384025409945337856>
help 2020-07-24 05:45:28 and yeah, but they just respawn and go again
help 2020-07-24 05:46:10 A hover or VTOL which carriers a fast spinning Gyrosphere cutter to bait Shredder worms & kill them instantly when they attack
help 2020-07-24 05:46:14 something like that
help 2020-07-24 05:48:10 like rn this bastard is **counting** the people he makes quit
help 2020-07-24 05:48:20 I am so pissed at these shredder users.
help 2020-07-24 06:01:17 there is no 'high enough' with em. They can go up to 600mph or more i've seen
help 2020-07-24 06:08:43 Ive doen it
help 2020-07-24 06:08:52 i built a Shredder worm Immunity shield
help 2020-07-24 06:08:54 Hell yeah
help 2020-07-24 06:09:31 He had to respawn over 10 times to get through it
help 2020-07-24 06:09:36 OHOHOHO IM A GENIUS!
help 2020-07-24 06:13:43 just need to attach it to a vehcile
help 2020-07-24 06:16:51 basically... its cheating the game, but also nullifies Shredder worms & acts as extra protection
help 2020-07-24 06:17:13 its quite litterally a force field
help 2020-07-24 06:17:55 Motors are used together to spin at such a rate, lined with TNT armour & cutters to create a barrier that flings them into the abyss on contact. The problem is countering the spin force
help 2020-07-24 06:18:11 The tank im trying to attatch this too is so heavy
help 2020-07-24 06:18:14 i wont have that issue
help 2020-07-24 06:18:34 its cheap
help 2020-07-24 06:18:40 it can definately be improved
help 2020-07-24 06:19:01 ... but it works. And you can do multiple layers, as well as remove blocks & position them with holes for the guns
help 2020-07-24 06:19:05 its all about cameras
help 2020-07-24 06:20:23 im aiming for 5 layers of this forcefield to guarantee Shredder immunity while allowing me to shoot outside the holes to kill them as well
help 2020-07-24 06:21:04 If it works in PVP i'll organise an entire server of shredders to try and break through all at once. See if it really is immune
help 2020-07-24 06:35:31 Yep. Ran out of save data but it makes you immune to cutter worms
help 2020-07-24 06:36:05 cant be bothered to crop, and its spinnin fast
help 2020-07-24 06:36:11 Very basic. Very bad. Does the job
help 2020-07-24 06:36:18 No more Shredder worms
help 2020-07-24 06:46:55 I used ballasts around the motors
help 2020-07-24 06:47:00 solved my issues
help 2020-07-24 06:47:15 not actually connected to the motors mind you, but it solved it
help 2020-07-24 06:49:24 I wouldnt go off my idea, but i just slapped some blocks on the 4 sides of the motor
help 2020-07-24 06:49:32 better off locking or adjusting torque
help 2020-07-24 06:50:25 ...it looks like a box

help 2020-07-24 07:38:16 Well, ive noticed about a 10 second delay on my tank before the Motor 2s actually kick in
help 2020-07-24 07:38:21 during that time the Conveyors work.
help 2020-07-24 07:38:29 after that? Completely shut off

help 2020-07-24 19:29:02 Decided to give one of those 'higher tech' jets a go. Installed a collapsible Wing set for carrier storage, thoughts?
help 2020-07-24 19:29:23 Should i alter the wing shape at all? Wanna do it as a blend of those F-15 styles and my own style
help 2020-07-24 19:33:42 Saw this by "CoolBroski82110" and i've decided im gonna shape the wings more like this and & those flaps.
help 2020-07-24 19:50:45 -
Left or right wing?
help 2020-07-24 19:51:01 which looks better with the shape of these wings?
help 2020-07-24 19:53:00 im leaning towards left personally
help 2020-07-24 19:57:24 Check its not a 2 year old YT tutorial one. Physics may be outdated.
help 2020-07-24 19:57:41 that issue reminds me of when i tried to do treads
help 2020-07-24 19:57:49 used a Tut & it kept falling of
help 2020-07-24 20:07:36 Ballasts can be used to fix this. Dot some beams around, lining the hull

help 2020-07-24 20:13:49 Helps keep stuff upright i think

help 2020-07-24 20:15:54 you'll put a wedge down, put the triangle wedges on

help 2020-07-24 20:20:16 -
when using Motor2 flaps for wings, should the wings be in line with the pilot seat / cockpit for the C camera view to center with the Motor2's ?
help 2020-07-24 20:20:24 or are the M2's manually controlled instead?
help 2020-07-24 20:20:28 
help 2020-07-24 20:20:36 (red is pilot seat)

Ello. Im curious to know how i see these small other aircraft are zipping  rounds turns as if there was a glass wall to slide on. Its being the bane of my combat experience so far and im puzzled. A small gun-stack brick with two Propellers could dart round a corner like a heccin fidget spinner.

meanwhile, my aircraft have to properly learn & bank to perform such turns and gotta cover at least a tight arc.
help 2020-07-25 02:49:34 E, i've had that issue a few times too. Locking the postons helps, but not much

creations-chat 2020-07-27 21:26:54 I look at fold builds & feel pain cos i wanna build stuff like that but i cant do folds
creations-chat 2020-07-27 21:45:09 Thoughts on the orange? Gonna darken the white once its 100% Finished. Adding Torps now.
creations-chat 2020-07-27 21:46:30 I'll be building spaceships in future so thats good to know & yes
help 2020-07-27 21:47:28 Carrier Elevators? Like actual Human elevators or somethin else?
help 2020-07-27 21:48:00 Ah i see
help 2020-07-27 21:48:03 googled a pic.
help 2020-07-27 21:48:19 In that situation I wouldn't dare use Ropes. Too shakey.
help 2020-07-27 21:48:42 Now, I havent tried this myself, but there is a thought i've always wanted to see tested
help 2020-07-27 21:49:16 Y'know how trains have those wheels & struts? Often used for their wheel things? Old train stuff
help 2020-07-27 21:49:18 ill grab an image
help 2020-07-27 21:49:43 These sorta wheels
help 2020-07-27 21:50:20 Could 2 pairs be used to elevate a platform in the center? One wheel spins one way, the other spins the other. The struts attatched to a platform in the center to create a lifting platform?
help 2020-07-27 21:50:40 odd to explain this but somethin like that has bugged me for a while
help 2020-07-27 21:54:39 just made a model
help 2020-07-27 21:54:45 it works beautifully
help 2020-07-27 21:55:13 
help 2020-07-27 21:55:43 Wheels spin oppositely to lift, Suspensions are dead.
help 2020-07-27 21:56:09 and by dead i mean they dont have any dampping or length, has a small shake issue but i think messing with suspensions can fix that
help 2020-07-27 21:56:41 yeah Stiffness 100% Fixes it
help 2020-07-27 21:56:53 Lemme see what 2 1k torque motors can pull in Ballasts
help 2020-07-27 21:57:01 this is 10 + 10 + 40
help 2020-07-27 21:57:50 260 points in ballasts, no problem up or down
help 2020-07-27 21:58:01 Shaking platform problem is back.

help 2020-07-27 22:06:35 *like a charm*
help 2020-07-27 22:08:50 Gonna see how much weight it can take
help 2020-07-27 22:09:20 testing with... **74** maxed out ballast beams, not attatched to the platform
help 2020-07-27 22:09:53 Conclusion: Can lift it, but the suspensions cause shaking.
help 2020-07-27 22:10:03 Gonna work on replacing them
help 2020-07-27 22:10:37 if they are, thank god. Middle finger to Shredder worms
help 2020-07-27 22:10:57 also depends on impact force, like speed & stuff
help 2020-07-27 22:15:29 works large scale too
help 2020-07-27 22:26:46 Attempted to elevate a car, Suspensions cause the platform to bounce back & forth like a ping pong game
help 2020-07-27 22:26:52 still working to improve it
help 2020-07-27 22:27:48 *i may have a solution*
help 2020-07-27 22:28:01 wait no nvm
help 2020-07-27 22:39:50 Nah, tried all i can really think off
help 2020-07-27 22:39:57 Cant fix the shaking of the suspensions
help 2020-07-27 22:40:11 well... now that i say that...
help 2020-07-27 22:40:16 there is one way
help 2020-07-27 22:40:22 yet to try

help 2020-07-27 22:53:49 Really? Its been bugging me all week
help 2020-07-27 22:54:30 I always thought if something like this would work and was putting bits together in my head. To see i was right is... well quite ego inflating to say the least.
help 2020-07-27 22:55:24 next problem to fix is the Motors. They aint strong enough to carry a lot. The platform is about 300 Blocks and it struggles a little
help 2020-07-27 22:55:36 Use of Helium eased it, but isnt viable for fold builds
help 2020-07-27 22:55:48 Engines would also have the same issue
help 2020-07-27 22:55:56 my current thought is **Conveyors**
help 2020-07-27 22:56:25 Vertical ones, with pistons that push it against the side of the platform & drive upward & downward to assist with lifting heavy stuff
help 2020-07-27 23:01:07 making the motors fast fixes the issue. Need to test a Heavy vehicle
help 2020-07-27 23:23:46 Works great now, even made the platform large enough for my Adamantite tank, a 3k block on another acc.
help 2020-07-28 05:58:58 *help my control panels are stupid and are being inverted*

creations-chat 2020-07-28 08:44:19 we do have 1x7 beams. why they're 7 points, idk. But could see 1x7 wedges in future
creations-chat 2020-07-28 08:58:00 If i need a really thin scale i do a handy thing with Motor locks, now that i've found their reality of engineering to do a 2x2 nose & lock everything back halfway to a side to make it centered.
help 2020-07-28 09:11:29 oh ok

creations-chat 2020-07-29 15:56:36 They're just a downvote bot

creations-chat 2020-07-29 16:17:10 planning ahead for my classes
creations-chat 2020-07-29 16:18:52 Custom Model. I go with the flow. 

Dreadnaughts are a modern class of ships, so i thought to ask here for Naval specialists to answer. Are they bigger, the same, or smaller than Battleships?
creations-chat 2020-07-29 16:19:50 oh? I thought they were a more newish style where firepower was all.
creations-chat 2020-07-29 16:19:57 is that a different kind of class?
creations-chat 2020-07-29 16:20:14 Sorry :P

i did some a while back but its faded from memory
creations-chat 2020-07-29 16:20:48 Oh yeah, quick google says it all. My massive mistake
creations-chat 2020-07-29 16:21:40 Ye, smaller & stockier
creations-chat 2020-07-29 16:21:56 I'll do a 2 fold for them, but use the false ideal of 'Firepower is all' for its design
creations-chat 2020-07-29 16:22:16 Cos i wanna do a 'Perses' Style cannon from SupCom Total Mayhem
creations-chat 2020-07-29 16:22:35 This
creations-chat 2020-07-29 16:22:36 
creations-chat 2020-07-29 16:22:57 its litterally a tower of Naval Guns
creations-chat 2020-07-29 16:24:34 meh, i'll try. This thing also has a Shield Generator. Thinking i'll do a Rotating glass dome for that.
creations-chat 2020-07-29 16:24:44 and uh, i'll try i guess
creations-chat 2020-07-29 16:25:16 i... dont know how to read that blueprint
creations-chat 2020-07-29 16:25:38 i mean, i do but
creations-chat 2020-07-29 16:25:50 Not the 'How do i build it to look like that' part
creations-chat 2020-07-29 16:26:17 Keep in mind I dont try & copy stuff. I just go with the flow for my builds, so a little adaptation will be done.
creations-chat 2020-07-29 16:26:47 Neato.
creations-chat 2020-07-29 16:27:16 btw, just as a reference (cos im willing to bet you have some amazing ships) can i get a screenshot or two of your creations?
creations-chat 2020-07-29 16:27:26 Inspiration is the greatest power for progress.
creations-chat 2020-07-29 16:27:35 <@!631445402155221002> Bloody genius move.

creations-chat 2020-07-29 16:37:33 & Balance it properly
creations-chat 2020-07-29 16:38:07 I started small too

Self Superiority (thinking your stuff is better)

creations-chat 2020-07-30 15:08:35 ngl that plane is hella clean
creations-chat 2020-07-30 15:08:49 This bot is the dumbest thing in this discord
creations-chat 2020-07-30 15:11:10 You also sketch your builds before making them?
creations-chat 2020-07-30 15:11:23 i thought i was the only one who did that stuff
creations-chat 2020-07-30 15:13:10 (careful, they'll warn you for chains)

creations-chat 2020-07-30 16:09:24 cant exactly see the mechanics cos its all blacked ut
creations-chat 2020-07-30 16:14:59 100% Cosmetic Trail spinner to simulate the Shield Generator. 
Classic Supreme Commander style for heavy naval.
creations-chat 2020-07-30 16:16:52 And progress shot
creations-chat 2020-07-30 16:17:24 I think im gonna do the Extra weapons simply cos i love the way those front cannons look
creations-chat 2020-07-30 16:17:49 Plus, it'll let me move onto the Dreadnaught or the Missile Cruiser next
creations-chat 2020-07-30 16:27:04 <@456226577798135808>  Oh cos I use <#384025409945337856> as a timeline for my creations, seeing how I've developed as a builder. Posting the WIP stuff here allows for instant criticism & suggestions. People are less likely to give build tips & stuff if i share in <#384025409945337856> .

<@!476629966780497931> Is the Bridge the box thing in the middle?
creations-chat 2020-07-30 16:27:34 If so, i do wanna redo it once i finish the back of the battleship.
creations-chat 2020-07-30 16:29:25 btw cos i had to slap a fold in for the bridge , im only just getting used to building upside down.
creations-chat 2020-07-30 16:29:44 So, getting there.
creations-chat 2020-07-30 16:30:52 Oof, put the part for you but missed the other dude
creations-chat 2020-07-30 16:30:54 uh,
creations-chat 2020-07-30 16:31:09 there we go
creations-chat 2020-07-30 16:31:25 But uh, yeah Ivan is the Bridge the box in the middle?
creations-chat 2020-07-30 16:32:39 ight
creations-chat 2020-07-30 16:32:50 I will 100% redo it. Cos is dont like how blocky it is
creations-chat 2020-07-30 16:32:54 Nor its decor.
creations-chat 2020-07-30 16:33:30 Ive used this Tech 1 Battleship from SupCom-TA as the model on how to build a Battleship.
creations-chat 2020-07-30 16:33:34 Might try and shape it more like that bridge
creations-chat 2020-07-30 16:35:19 <@456226577798135808> its the Meridian Class
creations-chat 2020-07-30 16:35:21 :3
creations-chat 2020-07-30 16:35:32 ye.

creations-chat 2020-07-30 17:02:13 Cant build extra guns. Not enough space on the folds
creations-chat 2020-07-30 17:02:22 gonna do the small air Strip instead.
help 2020-07-30 17:03:58 Q: What is the average Width of a Combat plane / jet?
help 2020-07-30 17:04:05 In PC Blocks
creations-chat 2020-07-30 17:44:23 Just about done. 

Added a short air strip, i don't know if it can house any aircraft however, and seems more ideal for a Heli or VTOL if anything.

Issues:
it 'lists' (tilts to one side) despite being Asymmetric. Currently working to fix.

No idea how on earth i make an interior. Never seen inside a Battleship before & there aren't many other builders who show interiors.

Despite all on the same keybind, not all the lights shine. May just be the game.
creations-chat 2020-07-30 17:46:06 I want to. But Supreme Commander Units are all Autonomous.
creations-chat 2020-07-30 17:46:11 So i might now
creations-chat 2020-07-30 17:46:14 not*
creations-chat 2020-07-30 17:46:28 No Crew needed when its call ran by an ACU (Armoured Command Unit)
creations-chat 2020-07-30 17:46:41 Just finishing up with improvements & then its done.
creations-chat 2020-07-30 17:48:37 Fixed the listing.
creations-chat 2020-07-30 17:48:49 And uh, Perhaps Rather than a drone with speakers
creations-chat 2020-07-30 17:49:57 Rather make Portable Rave Station , i guess. Dance floor, Disco Ball. DJ & Bar. Use of Motors & locks can compact it into a small lil box that nobody will expect
creations-chat 2020-07-30 17:50:07 just remember to use Lights, trails & all the bit
creations-chat 2020-07-30 17:50:35 Nah, If it sounds hard try one of those food trucks & see how easy they are
creations-chat 2020-07-30 17:50:44 *BTW fixed the tilting problem*

creations-chat 2020-07-30 19:27:32 welp
creations-chat 2020-07-30 19:27:40 Guess im doing the Swordsman
creations-chat 2020-07-30 20:06:37 **holy crap**
i just noticed that when you paint a block to a new material
creations-chat 2020-07-30 20:06:46 *Its not the default white*
creations-chat 2020-07-30 20:06:50 *but like*
creations-chat 2020-07-30 20:06:56 ***a single digit less***
creations-chat 2020-07-30 20:07:05 ***And it really heccin annoys me now***
creations-chat 2020-07-30 21:09:18 I know i said it would be a 3 fold... but i thought, "What holds more missiles... a longer or a chonker?" and i went with...
creations-chat 2020-07-30 21:09:39 c h o n k y missile cruiser.exe
creations-chat 2020-07-31 14:15:54 Progress on the missile cruiser. Decided since it'll only have one main cannon and a crap ton of missiles, I'd make it a bit interesting.
creations-chat 2020-07-31 14:16:44 4 main barrels using hover thrusters cosmetically to add 4 additional barrels to it. All rotates
creations-chat 2020-07-31 14:17:04 Colour Scheme was inspired by UEF Ships, but a Nerf style would be interestin.
creations-chat 2020-07-31 14:18:43 Gonna try another cannon design before i finish that one tho
creations-chat 2020-07-31 14:52:40 By flipping my elevator Mechanism on its side, i've effective simulated Cannon recoil.

Barrel is quickly blasted back from launch, and slowly returns to position.

not perfect, but also works for just full auto machineguns.
creations-chat 2020-07-31 14:56:45 <@!380926327210901506> Yo, thats awesome.

Would you be alright with sharing your design? I wanna see if I can attach it to a PVP Naval ship in future.

 In addition, if the motors used in the systems were sped up & conveyors were used in the magzine to move rounds, how fast can we make the loading time? 👀
creations-chat 2020-07-31 14:58:00 yeah idk what that is either
creations-chat 2020-07-31 14:58:08 I think its a helicopter
creations-chat 2020-07-31 14:58:12 ... kinda
creations-chat 2020-08-01 06:46:28 Now that i've improved my aircraft building skills and have began tapping into PVP (WASD) Controls, should i redo the Predator Interceptor?
creations-chat 2020-08-01 06:46:32 
creations-chat 2020-08-01 06:47:22 Note that was one of my first PVP Aircraft.
creations-chat 2020-08-01 06:47:41 Havent used Manual flaps until i made the Destiny MK 1
creations-chat 2020-08-01 06:47:51 and then the Apex Type A & Apex Type B
creations-chat 2020-08-01 06:49:05 Interceptors gotta be fast, sleek and nimble. Designed to Intercept aircraft mid travel (such as bombers) and chase / destroy. That's the intent for the Predator MK2 Design
creations-chat 2020-08-01 06:49:24 Should i keep the Dual Layered Wings? Idk if there is any benefit to them.
creations-chat 2020-08-01 06:51:52 Could Control Surfaces be used in tandom with Manual Flaps for More aircraft manuaverability?
creations-chat 2020-08-01 06:52:44 If Control Surfaces had a Toggle feature to Enable Follow Cursor & Disable Follow cursor my overall Plane ability would *triple* in quality as i love using Follow Cursor. Easier on my PC
creations-chat 2020-08-01 06:52:56 Control Surface 2 Potentially?
creations-chat 2020-08-01 06:58:31 oh wait hol on
creations-chat 2020-08-01 06:58:35 <@456226577798135808> You do boats?
creations-chat 2020-08-01 06:59:05 Civilian, industry or Militarised?
creations-chat 2020-08-01 07:03:11 Ah alright.
creations-chat 2020-08-01 07:07:15 new nose (left pic) really shows how much different my Plane Designs have become while building them. Got loads of aircraft now and it does show.
creations-chat 2020-08-01 07:07:18 proud of that
creations-chat 2020-08-01 07:08:51 Now. Looking for knowledge here...

**Q:** How do i install a C-Engine to an aircraft? (Conveyor Engine)

**Alternate:** Are Magnet Engines more stable than Conveyor engines for flight?
creations-chat 2020-08-01 07:28:44 *?*
creations-chat 2020-08-01 07:29:10 No as in, if you're going at Ludicrous speed, you wont have a seizure mid flight as your plane tries to stay stable
creations-chat 2020-08-01 07:29:43 my 700 Sds Jet has a shaking issue when it breaks 600 sds, idk how to fix it but i think its the speed.
help 2020-08-01 07:42:33 How do you fix a dipping aircraft? 
AKA, taking of but your plane slowly dips its nose down & has to be corrected.
help 2020-08-01 07:42:43 is it the wings? Thrust?

creations-chat 2020-08-01 16:06:15 
creations-chat 2020-08-01 16:06:32 Worked out in the end. Just build with the flow is the best ideal i got for it

help 2020-08-18 18:50:17 *not exactly*

help 2020-08-18 18:51:08 Well,
help 2020-08-18 18:52:08 =#=_==-^ This kind of wing style works with the wings & elevators and was used commonly on WW2 Aircraft
help 2020-08-18 18:52:35 =#=-==-^ is more modern style, but the wings are slight different.
help 2020-08-18 18:53:15 Yes.
help 2020-08-18 18:53:31 Experiment to see, is best advice

creations-chat 2020-08-18 20:48:12 yall keep any of your old builds?

help 2020-08-18 21:33:08 Are you using Control Panels Or flaps to turn?
help 2020-08-18 21:33:17 Control panels are slower but far more stable.
help 2020-08-18 21:33:33 A Flap is basically wing panels on a Motor 2 Servo
help 2020-08-18 21:33:51 Makes for extremly faster turning, but not good for PCs that have a low framerate
help 2020-08-18 21:45:00 As long as you got it on Server
help 2020-08-18 21:45:03 Servo*

creations-chat 2020-08-19 11:06:34 Hm. I do the Hull's of my boats very differently to that. I use the Wedges & Tri-Wedges for a smooth curve and flow from front to back.
creations-chat 2020-08-19 11:06:54 Whether they're better for performance or not, no clue.
creations-chat 2020-08-19 11:07:34 oof.
creations-chat 2020-08-19 11:08:01 I try to make basic mobility a primary goal, no matter how compact or enlarged a build is
creations-chat 2020-08-19 11:08:33 1. Its gotta look good.
2. Its gotta move good.
3. Its gotta *feel* good.
4. Its gotta have a good name.
creations-chat 2020-08-19 11:08:43 are basically my mindset pointers for my builds
creations-chat 2020-08-19 11:12:57 True. The Armata Overlord suffers from that
creations-chat 2020-08-19 11:13:36 It did however, achieve a Top Speed of 5 despite being around 6k blocks compressed *heavilty* by putting Beams everywhere
creations-chat 2020-08-19 11:22:05 So, overnight.

Predator MK4 was despised in downvotes.
Maddox. MK2 was a complete success.
Riptide MK3 was on the 'Meh' side starting up and scaled down.
And the Talcyon was a success too.

Kinda hard to crack the difference. 

i assume: Predator Mk4 was too wide (again) to which i probably agree. All but the Mk2 carried that Wide nose appearance, and at first it was an upvote collection despite being 90% control panels.

Riptide Mk3, probably a far better way to do Forward-Swept wings to which i dont know how, and the Nose may've also been a bit wide.

tbh i didnt wanna go beyond Mk4 for the Predator, but i wanna find a model and appearance that is universally liked by the majority.

So. 

**I'd like pointers on how to make a good looking interceptor, if possible.**
creations-chat 2020-08-19 11:36:43 *Sorry.*

So, I haven't built an aircraft in a long while, but even then i've never quite figured it out.

i'm using the DWG-262 Melanca from the Garmilon Empire of Space Battleship Yamato as a reference to design a new variant of my all-wing bomber.

However, I have no clue how to design a non-shoddy looking rudder for the swept wings of an all-wing aircraft. 

Anyone got any builds or examples that could give me a hand?
help 2020-12-19 14:51:59 Picture it as more blocky for obvious reasons, but I still dont know how to do a swept-wing rudder / elevator. Thats the goal i guess.

creations-chat 2021-08-08 04:24:05 <@!807806846009212968> Nice vehicle, you got a base chassis working. However asking for help in <#384025409945337856> is a lost cause. Playerbase has standards that can only be described as extreme, they do not care for a persons experience. ignore the upvotes and downvotes for the sake of yourself.

In the meanwhile, for a base start for getting into compexity, you can essentially do what I did and study some tutorials and build videos on Youtube. You'll learn techniques and methods you can re-create for some sweet and unique details and shapes you cant make normally. Alternatively, There are people like myself with roles like my "Expert Robotic Specialist" which normally offer information and insight if asked. So be sure to look out for those.

You got good stuff atm.
creations-chat 2021-08-08 04:33:31 I wasn't flexing. Read again. people with those roles I imagine would be more than happy to show people the ropes, especially when it's clear their just starting out.

Furthermore you've only further solidified my point about sharing creations in this discord being a lost cause. Person asks for helps to improve and potentially enjoy the game more and you'd rather shut him down uncaringly.
