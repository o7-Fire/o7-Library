help 2020-03-13 23:31:55 ok so i have 2 questions;
help 2020-03-13 23:32:34 i built a ship which was noticeably heavy from about halfway through the build
help 2020-03-13 23:32:41 and so now its complete, it capsizes
help 2020-03-13 23:32:57 is there any 'block' to make it more stable?
help 2020-03-13 23:34:11 http://prntscr.com/rg2fz5
help 2020-03-13 23:34:54 http://prntscr.com/rg2g7z
help 2020-03-13 23:36:30 what would the ballasts do though?
help 2020-03-13 23:36:34 make it more stable?
help 2020-03-13 23:37:32 thanks for the advice
help 2020-03-13 23:48:39 holy crap it works

creations-chat 2020-07-03 22:25:13 looks a lot cleaner
creations-chat 2020-07-03 22:27:37 i dont see anything wrong with that
creations-chat 2020-07-03 22:31:29 <@!358328414463066113> can i see the whole ship?
creations-chat 2020-07-03 22:32:25 wowww

creations-chat 2020-07-03 22:39:49 and i thought my ship was 'decent'
creations-chat 2020-07-03 22:41:54 does anyone else do this on their hulls? http://prntscr.com/tbfmk9
creations-chat 2020-07-03 22:42:04 i used different colours to show

creations-chat 2020-07-05 20:54:16 has anyone made a eurofighter typhoon?
help 2020-07-06 21:16:07 hi, there seems to be an invisible block which is preventing me from carrying on with my build http://prntscr.com/td03k2
help 2020-07-06 21:23:37 oh okay thanks
creations-chat 2020-07-07 23:09:00 never seen that model phantom before..
creations-chat 2020-07-08 00:20:48 anyway i can improve on my T45? http://prntscr.com/tdqg7l
creations-chat 2020-07-08 00:21:29 (rear picture) http://prntscr.com/tdqgue
creations-chat 2020-07-08 00:23:20 but i literally built it to how it looks
creations-chat 2020-07-08 00:23:36 eh
creations-chat 2020-07-08 00:23:46 gonna delete it
creations-chat 2020-11-24 14:53:56 <@!774377045346091008> im glad you like it!
creations-chat 2020-11-24 14:56:18 i do agree with the exterior needing some work - the angles of the ship are very hard to replicate with the wedges that are currently in the game, however i will keep working on it!
creations-chat 2020-11-24 15:01:18 also what would 60 upvotes achieve?
creations-chat 2020-11-24 15:03:58 ohhhh i see, nice!
bug-reports 2020-11-24 15:53:26 <@!559462059251859456> that happens if you lock the motor whilst the folds are moving
bug-reports 2020-11-24 15:53:49 if you let it come to rest naturally it wont bug out
bug-reports 2020-11-24 15:59:06 try replacing the engines
bug-reports 2020-11-24 15:59:15 oof
bug-reports 2020-11-24 15:59:28 try saving it into another slot
bug-reports 2020-11-24 15:59:31 then reloading it
bug-reports 2020-11-24 16:00:18 i have no idea then
creations-chat 2020-11-24 16:15:23 could sit a bit higher in the water and as Nannoc said the bridge could need some work but its looking great otherwise, keep at it!
creations-chat 2020-11-24 16:20:48 holy crap ive never had so many upvotes before, thank you so much i appreciate it a lot
creations-chat 2020-11-24 16:25:53 okay i will, thanks!
creations-chat 2020-11-24 16:31:46 i got my rank
creations-chat 2020-11-24 16:37:37 not sure why i didnt get master shipwright though, i did give evidence of an 8k+ block count..
creations-chat 2020-11-24 16:46:02 ohhhhh thank you
creations-chat 2020-11-24 18:48:35 i dont see any furniture in the hall of fame
creations-chat 2020-11-24 18:50:17 i do agree with you, 79 upvotes for a few emojis and basic blocks isnt really sufficient
creations-chat 2020-11-24 18:52:56 an 8k block creation **could** get into fall of fame, right?
creations-chat 2020-11-24 18:54:29 it currently has 60 upvotes
creations-chat 2020-11-24 19:18:41 ngl something seems off with that harrier <#384025409945337856>
creations-chat 2020-11-24 19:20:12 looks pretty good though
help 2020-11-24 19:23:45 <@!486276884611465256> yeah just play around with different shades and dark colours
help 2020-11-24 19:24:02 just go to a new server or mute them
help 2020-11-24 19:26:17 <@!376309548761481217> ive always wanted to see a Hawker Hunter in plane crazy 🤔
help 2020-11-24 19:26:53 n a u g h t y
help 2020-11-24 19:27:31 ah fair enough
help 2020-11-24 19:33:21 i think thats an early model
help 2020-11-24 19:33:34 the later ones had an extended fuselage
help 2020-11-24 19:33:40 *i think*
creations-chat 2020-11-24 19:49:52 question; how do i submit a creation for the hall of fame?
creations-chat 2020-11-24 19:52:36 it has already, im just curious how i would submit it. ah okay thanks <@!545793563703640065>
creations-chat 2020-11-24 20:02:36 maybe the angles of the screenshots arent doing it enough justice
creations-chat 2020-11-24 20:05:57 idk.. could be the wheels
creations-chat 2020-11-24 20:18:31 jesus - how many blocks is that?!
creations-chat 2020-11-24 20:21:28 thats a lot better
creations-chat 2020-11-24 20:23:00 its just frowned upon in the community tbh
creations-chat 2020-11-24 20:26:26 the first one you posted, with the red below the waterline <@!251880826386513924>
creations-chat 2020-11-24 20:30:35 yes <@!251880826386513924>
creations-chat 2020-11-24 20:38:24 ^
creations-chat 2020-11-24 20:41:39 what are you even trying to build ..?
creations-chat 2020-11-24 20:47:47 just because it got downvotes doesnt mean its bad, you can always upgrade it and keep working on it
help 2020-11-24 20:59:46 it would probably be easier to do it striped though
creations-chat 2020-11-24 21:03:25 yeah i like it too ngl
help 2020-11-24 21:09:33 its not that hard to do, just look at pictures and they'll show you where to put what

creations-chat 2020-11-24 23:36:32 eurofighter typhoon?
creations-chat 2020-11-24 23:48:15 <@!424995506654150677> the typhoon is looking great so far, best ive seen on plane crazy tbh
creations-chat 2020-11-25 01:23:32 you could do a motor with the thin part facing upwards on top of a block or two with a half cylinder face down on top <@!461644261566185503>
help 2020-11-25 01:55:00 wings
creations-chat 2020-11-25 02:07:10 jesus
help 2020-11-25 02:50:49 yes that should work
help 2020-11-25 02:51:12 use helium on the insides of your hull too to stabilize it
help 2020-11-25 02:51:37 i always put fuel blocks along the inside of the keel too for weight balance
help 2020-11-25 02:51:41 sorry
help 2020-11-25 02:51:45 i meant fuel blocks
help 2020-11-25 02:52:01 no they're weighted
help 2020-11-25 02:52:05 so they'll push downwards
help 2020-11-25 02:52:13 and help the helium make your ship stable
help 2020-11-25 02:52:34 yeah the helium will help that
help 2020-11-25 02:53:10 ah okay
help 2020-11-25 02:53:32 if you add the helium it should help a lot
help 2020-11-25 02:53:57 http://prntscr.com/vpilrb
help 2020-11-25 02:54:01 add the helium there
help 2020-11-25 02:54:07 throughout the whole ship
help 2020-11-25 02:54:15 on the outer and lowest point
help 2020-11-25 02:54:19 yes
help 2020-11-25 02:54:28 i do that on all my ships and ive never had a problem
help 2020-11-25 02:54:44 sometimes i add more or less depending on what the situation needs
help 2020-11-25 02:54:50 on each side
help 2020-11-25 02:55:31 yes
help 2020-11-25 02:55:37 you should be golden after that
help 2020-11-25 02:57:18 for my ship
help 2020-11-25 02:57:19 http://prntscr.com/vpin2t
help 2020-11-25 02:57:24 yellow is helium
help 2020-11-25 02:57:25 red is fuel
help 2020-11-25 02:57:34 through out the entire length
help 2020-11-25 02:57:51 yeah if its too top heavy itll topple
help 2020-11-25 02:58:08 and fuel blocks have quite a bit of weight to them so you can always use them to weigh it down
help 2020-11-25 02:58:23 then the helium will counteract that and push it upwards in the water so its still level
help 2020-11-25 02:58:27 but itll be 10x more stable
help 2020-11-25 02:59:28 you can use whatever you want really
help 2020-11-25 02:59:30 as long as it works
help 2020-11-25 02:59:49 but ive just never had a reason to use pontoons or ballast blocks
help 2020-11-25 03:02:47 ive never had that problem
help 2020-11-25 03:04:08 yeah that would help
help 2020-11-25 03:05:47 hence why i posted this http://prntscr.com/vpin2t
help 2020-11-25 03:05:52 (yellow helium)
help 2020-11-25 03:06:19 you're gonna want it at the highest and most outer points
help 2020-11-25 03:06:47 bruh
help 2020-11-25 03:08:45 probably not
help 2020-11-25 03:10:12 your build is quite thin
help 2020-11-25 03:10:26 if it had more width this wouldnt be as much of a problem
help 2020-11-25 03:10:49 ^
help 2020-11-25 03:12:27 does it tilt when you dont move?
help 2020-11-25 03:13:26 i didnt wanna suggest this but you could put cameras outside of the hull making up the width
creations-chat 2020-11-25 13:39:46 ships get the block count 😎
creations-chat 2020-11-25 13:43:16 a
creations-chat 2020-11-25 19:34:03 it's just the fact you've reposted this plane so many times ngl
creations-chat 2020-11-26 02:18:30 doesnt look that bad tbh
creations-chat 2020-11-26 03:10:47 <@743956753942577203> you're not supposed to post WiP builds in <#384025409945337856> :)
creations-chat 2020-11-26 03:12:43 ikr it's getting annoying
creations-chat 2020-11-26 03:15:03 I think the rule is more for builds that are literally half finished
creations-chat 2020-11-26 03:43:25 guys i could do with some help on getting the shape of the deck house right, any suggestions? thanks :)
bug-reports 2020-11-26 03:53:57 that's probably roblox physics messing up

creations-chat 2020-12-28 15:43:59 yeah im gonna change the water soon, it used to be brown but my brother made a suggestion to make it look "cleaner", thanks for the feedback!
creations-chat 2020-12-28 15:46:16 thank you so much, i appreciate it!
creations-chat 2020-12-28 17:24:28 ^
creations-chat 2020-12-28 17:27:21 i think it would be better to tell after you've done the rear of the fuselage
creations-chat 2020-12-28 18:04:12 i think twin since you have two air intakes, although rightly so that does not mean there will be 2 engines but it's your call honestly
creations-chat 2020-12-28 18:15:47 left
creations-chat 2020-12-28 18:27:24 the left doesn't look as 'fat', the version on the right looks quite stubby too
creations-chat 2020-12-28 18:40:59 <@!414359638302130176> he's been downvoting everyone's creations, did it to mine too
creations-chat 2020-12-28 19:02:57 thats about right really, maybe not go so thin near the rear
creations-chat 2021-01-04 01:52:59 lol

creations-chat 2021-03-10 03:52:14 hey im currently building an Astute-Class submarine and I'd just like some quick opinions / feedback on it so far please http://prntscr.com/10hb56h
help 2021-03-10 03:54:20 Hi, I could do with some feedback as I don't think I've got the top beam's shape correct on my wip Astute-Class submarine, thanks! 
http://prntscr.com/10hb56h
creations-chat 2021-03-10 03:55:43 are you sure it's too narrow? http://prntscr.com/10hnpbi i also know the sail is too close forward but i built it so i knew where it had to be
creations-chat 2021-03-10 03:59:36 Ah I see your point with it being too narrow now, thanks. The 'sail' refers to the tower-like structure above the main hull, I was just stating that I am aware of it being too close to the bow
creations-chat 2021-03-10 04:01:36 Ah, I built the sail in it's current place so I know how much further back I'd have to rebuild it. It's essentially just for reference
creations-chat 2021-05-19 01:58:03 thought i'd give a sneak peak view of the interior
creations-chat 2021-05-19 02:02:49 yessir, unfolded view is in <#384025409945337856>
creations-chat 2021-05-19 02:06:14 Thank you, it was a lot lighter before i added the metal material to it and didn't bother repainting
creations-chat 2021-05-19 02:50:42 🤷‍♂️
creations-chat 2021-05-20 03:47:52 <@!746383586755870821> it's not actually that bad, good work
creations-chat 2021-05-20 04:14:09 flamethrower
creations-chat 2021-05-20 17:23:34 some people don't upvote unless it's deemed *perfect* to them as well, so it's many factors really not just quality. I personally don't understand that logic as it's a game but each to their own
creations-chat 2021-05-20 17:25:35 yeah some people take it wayyyyy too far but i upvote if it somewhat looks similar, obviously we can't get the same parameters as a real object / vehicle as it's a game but the best we can do is try right? In regard to the F15, all you'd need to do is make the wings a tad straighter then boom you've nailed it on the head
creations-chat 2021-05-20 17:27:36 Not really, I have a Zumwalt-class Destroyer but due to the game not having 1 x 6/7/8 wedges I am unable to get the bow correct: https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/384025409945337856/780797911113007125

creations-chat 2021-05-21 19:01:36 it most likely will be

creations-chat 2022-01-04 20:15:39 <@!719168864705052802> since ur the first downvote, mind to tell me why you did / how i could improve?
creations-chat 2022-01-04 20:21:33 i think the parts you mentioned look alright
creations-chat 2022-01-04 20:23:58 I just don't use motorlock lol
creations-chat 2022-01-04 20:26:07 oh don't say that you'll give him an ego boost (not that he hasn't got one already)
creations-chat 2022-01-04 20:29:12 exactly, very elaborate
creations-chat 2022-01-04 20:32:22 i choose not to use motorlock as i find it makes my builds look more unique, taste is a subjective matter so it may look shitty to him but good to someone else
creations-chat 2022-01-04 20:39:33 ty this is actually constructive, the flight deck will probably be made longer but making the curve on the side of the hull will restrict me with the interior (which i haven't shown) also the deck was a personal touch lol i think it looks better than a straight drop
creations-chat 2022-01-05 01:17:17 thanks i appreciate it :)
creations-chat 2022-01-05 01:32:56 yeah i noticed the proportions were off earlier, oh well if it reaches 100 upvotes like my other ship ill be happy :)
creations-chat 2022-01-05 01:35:34 the ship?? i posted it like 6 hours ago and it barely had 20 upvotes 4 hours ago
creations-chat 2022-01-05 01:37:37 thats strange, must be the bot
