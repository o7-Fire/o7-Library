plane-crazy 2019-05-02 18:02:17 does anyone know how often the autosave saves?
plane-crazy 2019-05-02 18:00:12 how often does the autosave save?
plane-crazy 2019-05-02 13:57:20 i guess ill just have to keep an eye on it and see if it does it again
plane-crazy 2019-05-02 13:56:13 1
plane-crazy 2019-05-02 13:56:06 uhh
plane-crazy 2019-05-02 13:55:48 i only have 1 creation
plane-crazy 2019-05-02 13:55:12 its okay though i can rebuild but im just thinking for anyone else
plane-crazy 2019-05-02 13:54:28 http://prntscr.com/njitc3
plane-crazy 2019-05-02 13:53:42 i repeatedly saved it throughout my building last night and it was for some reason reverted to like 2 or 3 saves before the last
plane-crazy 2019-05-02 13:52:50 i think the game has a saving problem
plane-crazy 2019-04-30 23:06:30 is this a bug? http://prntscr.com/niwtrj
plane-crazy 2019-04-30 00:23:55 anything is possible
plane-crazy 2019-04-30 00:23:36 the game could also get double the players in that time
plane-crazy 2019-04-30 00:22:48 fair enough but is it possible?
plane-crazy 2019-04-30 00:22:11 to make a map bigger along with the build squares?
plane-crazy 2019-04-30 00:21:13 well i think the game has potential
plane-crazy 2019-04-30 00:20:48 why not
plane-crazy 2019-04-30 00:20:39 cant the build squares be made bigger along with the map?
plane-crazy 2019-04-29 01:16:18 yeah true, thank you
plane-crazy 2019-04-29 01:15:58 thanks for the help anyway
