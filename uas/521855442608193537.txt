help 2021-04-08 14:02:52 I don;t think that's the issue here but reducing torque on motors does help with jitteriness sometimes
creations-chat 2021-04-08 14:04:41 <@!761850987714445344> how many hours do you have in plane crazy?
creations-chat 2021-04-08 14:09:23 Ah, not too much experience, but some. I would consider using wedges and more advanced design tricks
creations-chat 2021-04-08 14:12:00 I should point out that all of you who are insulting it so bad should have some respect for the fact that an inexperienced player felt confident enough to post his build

help 2021-08-26 17:26:32 i meant folding lol
help 2021-08-26 17:27:42 basically if you attach the  fold struts to the build with disconnectors, you can then use magnets to weld the pieces together and then remove the folding motor
help 2021-08-26 17:28:07 it only works if you use a motor 2 tho
help 2021-08-26 17:28:19 and the magnets gotta have a range under 15
help 2021-08-26 17:28:46 A friend taught me it

help 2021-12-13 19:04:33 so I'm trying to figure out how to make the Lockheed CL-1201 at player scale in the game and, with plots being 51 x 51 x 39

help 2021-12-13 19:11:24 ~~watch me~~
help 2021-12-13 19:11:52 im thinking the wings could be on the top and bottom of the plot in order to maximize use of the 51x51 space
help 2021-12-13 19:12:04 and I can kinda squeeze the fuselage in there between them
help 2021-12-13 19:13:06 I might have to break out the dark arts to make this tbh

creations-chat 2021-12-20 14:30:39 The reason I detailed it extensively is so that it isn't forcing him to rush. 
Essentially what I'm saying is to release what already exists, then continue to work on it afterwards, perhaps even at a less stressful rate

I want to make it clear that I in no way want to rush Rick, and I understand he's a busy man. My suggestions is what I see as the best possible compromise, preserving rick's ability to work on the game at a less stressful speed while letting everyone get the one thing we all want so desperately

creations-chat 2023-03-29 03:35:34 engines are too big for the wings and gear, but nice contra-rotating props
bug-reports 2023-07-07 03:56:35 anyone else getting kicked frequently since the update?
bug-reports 2023-07-07 04:10:08 this is new bozo
bug-reports 2023-07-07 04:23:45 just confirmed if you place a cylinder against another cylinder's rounded side you get kicked
bug-reports 2023-07-07 04:24:37 i think if you place anything on the rounded edge of a cylinder it does it
bug-reports 2023-07-07 04:29:03 HOW
bug-reports 2023-07-07 04:32:18 dammit still
bug-reports 2023-07-07 04:33:55 use opera dingus
bug-reports 2023-07-07 04:36:11 it might be a custom kick message for people who use that copy hack to make them think its an error
bug-reports 2023-07-07 04:36:31 oh
bug-reports 2023-07-07 04:36:37 definitely the anti-copy then
bug-reports 2023-07-07 04:37:55 hes showing the image as an example of what an error code looks like
bug-reports 2023-07-07 04:38:03 yeah
bug-reports 2023-07-07 04:38:25 if it isnt anti-copy then i'd guess the private server kick script got messed up
bug-reports 2023-07-07 04:38:50 those are the only 2 reasons for a script to kick a player i think
