creations-chat 2020-09-27 00:47:08 > yup it can absolutely be improved
<@265819387498332160> this is why, you're criticizing a tank from ww2
creations-chat 2020-09-27 00:47:38 You tell me it looks like a box and it looks like there's something wrong with it but don't know why?
creations-chat 2020-09-27 00:48:15 > Theres gonna be a 5 day slow mode soon within the next argument

creations-chat 2020-09-27 00:50:38 > Tbh the turrent doesnt look on scale with the hull even with blueprints the pov on blueprint will be flat so if you use it as a fish scale the blueprint will make it look fat (repost)

creations-chat 2021-10-14 15:55:32 I never left and I was never negative but go on chump, I gave genuine feedback when people ask, you think im going to message every person that has a build downvoted by me? no they have to ask me first
also to add just because I have high standards doesn't mean I'm a "jerk" 
setting high standards makes the rest of the community want to improve and make pog builds. Irl is set high standards on myself which is why I improved so much physically and mentally.
I only get toxic when you get toxic first, if you genuinely want feedback dm and don't be a jerk about it

"Update note
I keep seeing this come up, you can only choose from 1 of the 3 classes listed, and you have to follow the restrictions in the class.

you can now use 2 propellers extra ONLY for lifting and descending" 
just use wings

events-chat 2022-02-22 20:52:33 <@603974932585644043> okay no more haha moment, you seriously need to reconsider making the torpedoes guided, they're extremely annoying to balance and make accurate. literally making it travel in a straight line is the most annoying thing ever, they're also so easy to dodge, this isn't fleet battles where you can only move horizontally, this is in the air where ships can move vertically. Unguided torpedoes are extremely obsolete in this kind of event, I doubt people would pick it over the gun ship or destroyer. 
if you think they'd be op if they were guided just add some restrictions,  2 unguided torpedoes is comparable to a baby when it comes to threat level in a sky battle
plane crazy physics are also stupid, yeah a cutter on the tip is cool but half the time it'll just bounce off with only destroying one block
events-chat 2022-02-22 20:57:38 oh I didn't know the dreadnought was slow, nvm<:trollface:775024642104229898>

events-chat 2022-02-23 01:01:07 isnt rbk black?

events-chat 2022-02-23 01:03:23 my build is 30x26x13 in build mode, when i spawn its 30x17x13  the reason its 26 is cause of motorlock tower
events-chat 2022-02-23 01:04:10 why tho?
events-chat 2022-02-23 01:04:32 it fits the limits when spawned in, give me a good fucking reason why thats not allowed
events-chat 2022-02-23 01:05:32 dont give me some "people dont know how to motorlock bs" WHY EVEN ALLOWED MOTORLOCK THEN
events-chat 2022-02-23 01:06:03 please get in vc or some man holy shit you dont get what im saying
events-chat 2022-02-23 01:07:00 no its not
events-chat 2022-02-23 01:07:17 shep is giving a stupid excuse on why its not allowed
events-chat 2022-02-23 01:08:07 why does it matter if it exceeds in build mode IF IT FITS IN SPAWN MODE 
answer man
events-chat 2022-02-23 01:08:34 like wtf is this? this isnt even an answer
events-chat 2022-02-23 01:16:43 its all good  its just that i dont understand why it isnt allowed, i think youre confused on what we're talking about so ill send an image of what we mean
events-chat 2022-02-23 01:18:25 what channel
events-chat 2022-02-23 01:18:50 no dont
events-chat 2022-02-23 01:19:10 allow it cause its dumb to not allow it
events-chat 2022-02-23 01:19:49 this is what we're talking about
okay so jim made build that goes past 50 block  as seen in this image
events-chat 2022-02-23 01:20:11 but when he spawns it in its 2x3
events-chat 2022-02-23 01:20:32 shep told him its not allowed even tho it fits the limit when spawned
events-chat 2022-02-23 01:20:52 give me a valid reason why its not allowed
events-chat 2022-02-23 01:22:24 <@!603974932585644043>  what do you think about his build? would it be allowed or no
events-chat 2022-02-23 01:23:09 <@!466793357318815744>  why is my build not allowed<:FineTroll:626841259746656289>
events-chat 2022-02-23 01:23:34 you still havent provided a reason on why its not allowed
events-chat 2022-02-23 01:23:57 no, you havent.
events-chat 2022-02-23 01:25:36 thats still not a reason on why its not allowed man
events-chat 2022-02-23 01:26:20 so its not allowed because its a more dense build? you know how stupid that sounds? thats legit what motorlock is my guy
events-chat 2022-02-23 01:27:54 then say no motorlock at all!
events-chat 2022-02-23 01:28:41 no because i could motorlock within the limit and make my build just as dense!! so your rule is stupid!1
events-chat 2022-02-23 01:29:45 yeah sorry because this legit has never been said in an event before
events-chat 2022-02-23 01:30:02 youre the only person to come up with that stupid ass rule

will you pick like 1-2 from each class or will it just be selected without caring about the airship class
events-chat 2022-02-23 05:16:02 so class doesn't matter?
events-chat 2022-02-23 05:16:35 oh okay so for example 
2 gunship 
1 destroyer and 1 torpedo bomber per team?
events-chat 2022-02-23 05:16:54 yeah thats probably the lowest chance of being selected cause everyone is making them
events-chat 2022-02-23 05:17:10 I'll probably be the only person with torpedo bomber💀
events-chat 2022-02-23 05:18:12 but i thought it was 4v4+cruiser and dreadnought
events-chat 2022-02-23 05:18:32 but there's only 3 classes!

events-chat 2022-02-23 05:48:20 torpedo bomber obviously best class
events-chat 2022-02-23 06:10:42 watch and learb
events-chat 2022-02-23 06:11:57 the goal isn't to blow up your ship, its to blow up dreadnought
events-chat 2022-02-23 06:13:33 well thats no fun
events-chat 2022-02-23 06:14:00 anyways can't wait to one shot yhe dreadnought
events-chat 2022-02-23 06:28:42 thsyre pretty hard to make work without rockets...

events-chat 2022-02-24 03:02:34 don't be a jerk
events-chat 2022-02-24 03:04:15 you can make them however you want just can't be guided
reason is the dreadnought goes like 75 speed
events-chat 2022-02-24 03:04:36 its a good thing they made is unguided as mime can literally one-shot it
events-chat 2022-02-24 03:05:19 <@603974932585644043>
events-chat 2022-02-24 03:06:46 how accurate are your torpedo
events-chat 2022-02-24 03:08:19 a cluster bomb inside a torpedo 🤨
events-chat 2022-02-24 03:09:03 skill issue
events-chat 2022-02-24 03:09:33 gonna have one cutter and one tent torpedo<:trollface:775024642104229898>
events-chat 2022-02-24 03:13:48 <@603974932585644043>  are we allowed to use rocket or jet engine in torpedoes? it doesn't specify
events-chat 2022-02-24 03:15:24 its kind of impossible to make them go past 350 speed with only props
events-chat 2022-02-24 03:17:31 my missile could one-shot that
events-chat 2022-02-24 03:32:50 it does matter, you're gonna need accurate torpedoes for this battle, trust me
events-chat 2022-02-24 03:35:23 if your torpedo can't fly in a straight line across the map its harmless
events-chat 2022-02-24 03:35:41 sure
events-chat 2022-02-24 03:36:02 can it travel tho?
events-chat 2022-02-24 03:37:26 torpedoes can go at 500 speed, and again they're meant to target the dreadnought <:trollface:775024642104229898>
events-chat 2022-02-24 03:37:53 I guess
events-chat 2022-02-24 03:38:18 shep hasn't answered, he said max speed they can go is 500 but only jet engine+ can go that fast
events-chat 2022-02-24 03:38:52 but anyways gl against cluster bomber
events-chat 2022-02-24 15:42:07 <@603974932585644043>  wake up
events-chat 2022-02-24 17:46:21 <@466793357318815744>  are rockets or jet engines allowed on torpedoes? shep didn't specify
