help 2023-05-04 11:16:52 Aight i got a question i made the uss discovery from star trek discovery and i am trying to make a spore drive. The spin animation thing is taken care of, but the actual jump is confusing and i just need someone to help me choose a tactic for this.
Ive been thinking about using a conveyor drive mixed with one of those wierd half piston teleporters. Is that possible? And can yiu use those half piston teleporters more than once because every time it seems to only work once before i have to respawn.

Sorry this is a long question.
