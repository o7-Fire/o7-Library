creations-chat 2020-09-08 06:35:26 could we have a technical things channel bc i cant understand how conveyor engines work
creations-chat 2020-09-11 13:47:32 honestly the wiki needs to be updated or something
creations-chat 2020-09-11 13:48:49 all my creations are digusting looking
creations-chat 2020-09-11 13:49:53 has anyone tried making a hyperfast barrel gun
creations-chat 2020-09-11 13:50:03 like barrels that have magnet engines in them
creations-chat 2020-09-11 13:50:08 or conveyor
creations-chat 2020-09-11 13:50:46 ?
creations-chat 2020-09-11 13:51:03 we should gather all the tutorials for plane crazy and gather them into one place
creations-chat 2020-09-11 13:56:03 **not when theres an entire army of shredders**
creations-chat 2020-09-11 14:03:54 i like engines exposed it adds a technical side to the build?
~~gets thrown out by all the plane crazy builders~~
creations-chat 2020-09-20 04:28:08 oooh iron harvest
creations-chat 2020-09-20 04:28:29 *insert saxony joke*
creations-chat 2020-10-03 02:15:06 or just something destructible
creations-chat 2020-10-03 02:15:36 like we could have a building or something
creations-chat 2020-10-03 02:16:19 yes
creations-chat 2020-10-03 02:17:11 *bruh i suggested destructible buildings which would be fun*
creations-chat 2020-10-03 02:17:48 player-made buildings?
ok lemme make some building for me to destroy then
creations-chat 2020-10-03 02:18:15 hmmmm
creations-chat 2020-10-03 02:18:35 **OH YES**
creations-chat 2020-10-03 02:18:59 perhaps we could do the atomic bomb thing where theres a shockwave that topples trees
creations-chat 2020-10-03 02:19:17 or something like that idk
but buildings is just fun
creations-chat 2020-10-03 02:19:35 collapsing stuff is always fun
creations-chat 2020-10-03 02:20:21 **yeah but destructible terrain**
creations-chat 2020-10-03 02:20:40 we need destructible terrain then bombers would be noice
creations-chat 2020-10-03 02:21:14 yes
creations-chat 2020-10-03 02:21:36 heh i have a new gamemode idea: carrier pvp
creations-chat 2020-10-03 02:22:00 so basically two carriers try to destroy each other and there are 10 plots on each carrier
creations-chat 2020-10-03 02:22:16 kinda like any plane battle game but you get to make your own planes
creations-chat 2020-10-03 02:22:34 **but with custom planes**
creations-chat 2020-10-03 02:22:53 we can just ban the shredders lol
creations-chat 2020-10-03 02:23:36 **hey can we add destructible towers**
`warned for 9/11 joke`
creations-chat 2020-10-03 02:23:52 **b r u h**
creations-chat 2020-10-03 02:24:12 hm yes
creations-chat 2020-10-03 02:24:30 **ono**
creations-chat 2020-10-03 02:24:47 well tbf that was slightly inappropriate to use... that term
creations-chat 2020-10-03 02:25:59 but yeah plane wars would be nice
creations-chat 2020-10-03 02:26:16 kinda like custom plane zeppelin wars i would play that
creations-chat 2020-10-03 02:28:19 __Plane Wars Idea__
Goal the game: uh capture objectives abc
players start on two sides of the map in hangars with 10 plots each (ten players per team), players can spawn their designs from plane crazy normal gamemode and also build new planes on the fly.
creations-chat 2020-10-03 02:28:40 yeah
creations-chat 2020-10-03 02:28:58 <#384021699466756107> ?

creations-chat 2020-10-03 10:07:42 just asking
creations-chat 2020-10-03 10:09:54 thoughts on biplane design? i know im a nub
creations-chat 2020-10-21 04:34:01 do you guys know how to make carriers with deployable vehicles?
creations-chat 2020-10-21 04:37:26 this will be my deployable sub
im totally using it correctly btw
creations-chat 2020-10-21 04:41:07 that was fast
creations-chat 2020-10-27 10:01:36 it could be some sort of realistic design or something but if it's not remove the symbol
the-dump 2020-10-31 10:39:57 When you discover a underage person in this discord server
creations-chat 2020-11-05 08:34:56 nah the cool kids nowadays build two-plot sized builds and fold them
creations-chat 2020-11-05 08:36:28 nah the real cool kids get about 20 alts and get a vip server to build a 200000 block build also slowmode on here sucks
creations-chat 2020-11-05 08:38:02 what should i build for the contest tho
im thinking of an aquarium tank underwater
creations-chat 2020-11-05 08:42:27 whats that
creations-chat 2020-11-05 08:51:36 If you take a ship and put ballast blocks and color it with corroded metal and sink it,
its not a submarine, its a shipwreck which is a structure.
creations-chat 2020-11-05 08:55:39 eh no one will notice
creations-chat 2020-11-21 01:46:27 wow what an amazing build
this build uses revolutionary techniques
creations-chat 2020-11-21 01:48:19 I must agree this build looks very detailed with its clear absence of motorlock
creations-chat 2020-11-21 01:51:06 yes he deserves the rank look at the detailed motorlock and suspension on it
and look at that mechanism over there didn't think of that
creations-chat 2020-11-21 01:52:49 it is an amazing feat of plane crazy aeronautic engineering
creations-chat 2020-11-21 01:54:44 this person should get all of the roles possible just by this build purely by association
