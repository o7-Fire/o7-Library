help 2020-06-09 04:39:40 Anybody have good tips for single rotor helis, this one I converted is really unstable but it can fly
help 2020-06-09 04:42:21 No I mean
help 2020-06-09 04:42:44 
help 2020-06-09 04:42:57 It only has one rotor on top in comparison to two which is typically used
help 2020-06-09 04:43:32 Because two rotors is the only easy way to counteract torque but even with a tail rotor set to the right speed for countering the torque, it‚Äôs still very unstable
help 2020-06-09 04:45:31 I already have lol that‚Äôs not what I mean
help 2020-06-09 04:45:48

creations-chat 2020-07-22 16:39:42 Imagine being so confined to being realistic
creations-chat 2020-07-22 16:41:08 Bulbous designs are actually considered cartoony
creations-chat 2020-07-22 16:48:39 > the cartoon-like style aims to exaggerate features that makes the plane more unique
<@!489910972946055172>  so you agree basically
creations-chat 2020-07-22 16:50:14 It sounds like you agree with me but with extra steps

bug-reports 2020-07-25 22:38:08 Unguided rockets that launch off of motor 2‚Äôs are broken and will get stuck in the air and only move when a player is right by them which is weird. I‚Äôve done tests using just a propulsion block and this is true.

creations-chat 2020-07-28 18:03:06 Anybody have a compact and very efficient and strong conveyor gyro stabilizer?
help 2020-07-28 18:22:46 <@523278765825196062> I‚Äôve been having that same problem too, the only way I know how to fix it is to use regular motors for the turrets which sucks because we all want to use our mouse
creations-chat 2020-07-29 16:44:26 Currently not at my computer so I can‚Äôt get a better picture, this is outdated anyways without colors, interior, weapons, but does anyone think this is hall of fame worthy? (In the picture it‚Äôs at about 3000 blocks but now it‚Äôs over 4000)
creations-chat 2020-07-29 16:47:59 I‚Äôve gotta get an updated picture but I won‚Äôt be one for a few hours
creations-chat 2020-07-29 16:48:37 Sounds good I appreciate it üôÇ
creations-chat 2020-07-29 17:28:47 Yuppp I‚Äôm glad someone knows lol <@586354707723845636>
creations-chat 2020-07-29 17:53:08 <@586354707723845636> yes it hovers and in the picture since it‚Äôs old it doesn‚Äôt have guns but it does now. Also the engines swivel and move alongside the desired direction. I thought reaper was a cool specialist though
bug-reports 2020-07-29 21:11:38 Fr I don‚Äôt see anything wrong not why that one guy was trippin
help 2020-07-29 22:01:47 Anyone have any good tips on reducing lag with big builds that have a few folds and are around 4K blocks?
creations-chat 2020-07-30 03:30:02 Server lag kills my mothership :(
creations-chat 2020-07-30 03:30:21 1k is fine normally
creations-chat 2020-07-30 03:30:29 Builds with folds will suffer the most
creations-chat 2020-07-30 03:30:51 You‚Äôre fine using locked most of the time
creations-chat 2020-07-30 03:30:57 Magnets will hinder it a lot
creations-chat 2020-07-30 03:31:35 Remove the magnets and you‚Äôll see improvement
creations-chat 2020-07-30 03:31:41 If you‚Äôre using folds then yeah
creations-chat 2020-07-30 03:31:51 For what?
creations-chat 2020-07-30 03:32:08 If just for turrets and small things you‚Äôre fine
help 2020-07-30 03:37:49 Yeah you can‚Äôt really do roll with motor 2 only control surfaces
help 2020-07-30 03:40:06 Actually well that‚Äôs a lie but it‚Äôs not gonna be what you want, just invert one of the motors and it‚Äôll work but you gotta point your mouse up and down
creations-chat 2020-07-30 03:54:34 Honest thoughts on this? https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/384025409945337856/738236045006733393

creations-chat 2020-07-30 19:01:45 I think he meant it‚Äôs gonna be a tutorial
bug-reports 2020-07-30 21:42:52 
bug-reports 2020-07-30 21:43:55 please fix, custom rockets fired off disconnectors attached to motor 2's will always get stuck in mid air no matter what, only switching to regular motors will work but that ruins rocket turrets.
bug-reports 2020-07-30 22:01:36 Indeed that‚Äôs what I did
bug-reports 2020-07-30 22:14:34 Never happened :0
bug-reports 2020-07-30 22:58:41 Jeez calm down lol why you so pressed
bug-reports 2020-07-30 22:58:53 Taking something light hearted so seriously
bug-reports 2020-07-30 22:59:14 Anyways how‚Äôs the bug not related to plane crazy
bug-reports 2020-07-30 22:59:25 Other people experience it, it‚Äôs constant
bug-reports 2020-07-30 22:59:39 I couldn‚Äôt understand how
bug-reports 2020-07-30 22:59:59 Why doesn‚Äôt the same thing happen to say motor 1 turrets?
bug-reports 2020-07-30 23:00:16 Alt calm down dude
bug-reports 2020-07-30 23:00:26 I edited it since you were so pressed about me pinging him
bug-reports 2020-07-30 23:00:44 Dude chill holy
bug-reports 2020-07-30 23:01:08 Okay then I‚Äôll just edit it again and ping him

bug-reports 2020-07-30 23:01:34 I‚Äôm not on discord enough to know üòÇ
bug-reports 2020-07-30 23:02:01 Eh if you didn‚Äôt whine about it it would‚Äônt of happened
bug-reports 2020-07-30 23:02:57 Because I‚Äôm not aware of ghost pinging since I don‚Äôt live on discord
bug-reports 2020-07-30 23:03:09 You definitely have been whining
bug-reports 2020-07-30 23:03:33 You‚Äôve gone and sent like 10 messages about it and you keep complaining to mods about  simple mistake
bug-reports 2020-07-30 23:03:36 Like quit crying jeez
bug-reports 2020-07-30 23:03:47 Yeah it was unintentional
bug-reports 2020-07-30 23:03:50 You literally are
bug-reports 2020-07-30 23:03:55 You want to make a problem out of nothing
bug-reports 2020-07-30 23:04:11 I said it was unintentional
bug-reports 2020-07-30 23:04:13 Holy omg
bug-reports 2020-07-30 23:04:29 Bro
bug-reports 2020-07-30 23:04:32 You are something else
bug-reports 2020-07-30 23:04:40 That was a joke üòÇ
bug-reports 2020-07-30 23:04:48 That‚Äôs why I said ‚Äúnever happened :0‚Äù
bug-reports 2020-07-30 23:05:05 I know mods have logs
bug-reports 2020-07-30 23:05:19 I didn‚Äôt say it was
bug-reports 2020-07-30 23:05:23 I said it was unintentional
bug-reports 2020-07-30 23:05:33 But you want to make it into a big problem
bug-reports 2020-07-30 23:05:35 Bro
bug-reports 2020-07-30 23:05:37 Listen to me?
bug-reports 2020-07-30 23:05:43 I said covering it up was
bug-reports 2020-07-30 23:05:45 Omg
bug-reports 2020-07-30 23:05:53 Not pinging him to begin with
bug-reports 2020-07-30 23:06:03 I deleted it for your whining sake
bug-reports 2020-07-30 23:06:08 I know it wouldn‚Äôt make a difference
bug-reports 2020-07-30 23:06:17 But I thought perhaps if the literal text wasn‚Äôt there you wouldn‚Äôt cry
bug-reports 2020-07-30 23:06:24 But instead ghost pinging is the problem now
bug-reports 2020-07-30 23:06:55 Dude the ping isn‚Äôt even that big of a problem in the first place
bug-reports 2020-07-30 23:07:04 I doubt rick has notifications on and plus someone pinged him above me
bug-reports 2020-07-30 23:07:16 Regardless he will have a notification in this specific channel
bug-reports 2020-07-30 23:07:29 Bruh you need to educate yourself
bug-reports 2020-07-30 23:07:35 You‚Äôre the one making it a problem

bug-reports 2020-07-30 23:10:19 Making problems out of nothing, some toxicity that is. I don‚Äôt care about the screenshots I‚Äôve done nothing wrong intentionally

bug-reports 2020-07-30 23:11:28 Like you don‚Äôt look smart or right doing it
bug-reports 2020-07-30 23:11:30 So stop trying
bug-reports 2020-07-30 23:11:44 Ironic coming from you
bug-reports 2020-07-30 23:11:58 Turning a mistake into a big problem and bugging mods about it while spamming the chat with nonsense

bug-reports 2020-08-13 19:11:43 Does anyone even completely understand cameras and is capable of harnessing their power?

bug-reports 2020-08-13 19:29:29 Cameras point towards a block
bug-reports 2020-08-13 19:36:16 They are indeed quite funky, they work sometimes, have interesting welds i suppose, but function differently everytime you reload up until they stop working entirely lol

help 2020-08-16 23:43:33 So anyone know how to revert the forced spawn camera bug. I‚Äôve done it before multiple times and it‚Äôs possible by doing something but I always forget lol, who remembers how
help 2020-08-16 23:44:29 Oh I mean spawning in with a locked camera, then needing to press C twice to have a free cam
help 2020-08-16 23:45:12 True, an alternative. I‚Äôll keep digging for the fix I used before
help 2020-08-17 01:01:58 Nvm lol I found the issue and apparently it‚Äôs an intended feature which is poopy
bug-reports 2020-08-17 16:03:04 Yep just Rick
help 2020-08-18 17:10:29 Using two motor 2‚Äôs for a single rotation is the best you can get for it not being so unstable
bug-reports 2020-09-10 09:11:31 Hey dood
bug-reports 2020-09-10 17:47:46 Motor 2 has indeed seemed a little more unstable in servo mode lately. Some builds with angled parts are consistently unstable and wobbly now unlike before

creations-chat 2020-10-25 10:41:47 And yet again people will fail to realize that noobs exist and that they‚Äôre learning mechanics
creations-chat 2020-10-25 10:44:26 We‚Äôve all been at that level in the game, anyways it‚Äôs not common knowledge to not post what is to us a nooby creation.

creations-chat 2021-04-10 03:10:56 How ironic, sounds like you can‚Äôt even use motorlock effectively if even putting a logo on the front would be a struggle
creations-chat 2021-04-10 03:13:35 my guy I can easily do that, there‚Äôs something called camera locking in plane crazy too. Getting a logo on an angle isn‚Äôt hard yet I‚Äôm not going to get on roblox to prove something to some generic noob like you
creations-chat 2021-04-10 03:16:33 my guy I can easily do that, there‚Äôs something called camera locking in plane crazy too. Getting a logo on an angle isn‚Äôt hard yet I‚Äôm not going to get on roblox to prove something to some generic noob like you

‚ÄúYou expect way too much from people‚Äù does that not contradict what you said to that other guy before?
creations-chat 2021-04-10 03:20:04 I‚Äôm at work. I‚Äôm not going to get on just to hold your hand like the little kid you are. If think so highly of yourself to look down on people with white names then you should know basic plane crazy skills. How ironic that you make fun of others
creations-chat 2021-04-10 03:22:07 You don‚Äôt have basic skills because somehow you find a triangle too complex of a shape to motorlock? And you can‚Äôt even put a logo onto motorlocked detail?
creations-chat 2021-04-11 04:54:17 <@!274565008837574656> how many accounts did you need to use for that building?

I‚Äôm not seeing anything prior to what you said
help 2021-05-19 06:13:13 What does the fixed option do for smoke pipes
help 2021-05-19 06:14:47 It would be cool if that option made the smoke that comes out go in a fixed straight like that doesn‚Äôt waver when you move, would be good for large thrusters
help 2021-05-19 06:17:29 I see no changes at all
bug-reports 2021-05-30 21:01:09 It happens when you have them on motors
bug-reports 2021-05-30 21:01:22 Can‚Äôt put missiles on a turret sadly
creations-chat 2021-06-12 23:26:58 It‚Äôs more of a personal knack but I think the build looks too rough and blocky. Flir looks a bit too big too. It‚Äôs not a bad build though. The rocket pods are good, if I could give advice on them I‚Äôd say to make the pods rectangular to fit the shape the holes take. Or alternatively adding more holes to fill in the rocket pods shape.
creations-chat 2021-06-13 22:47:00 I‚Äôll never understand why some of y‚Äôall be so sensitive, to whatever is going on lmao

Oh oops
creations-chat 2021-11-02 08:55:30

Otherwise nice build

Re: Yes lmao, learn about proportions
creations-chat 2021-11-19 22:13:20 Looks much better, I think others will agree üòé

*maybe there‚Äôs a good reason why everyone else uses trails as well üò≥*
creations-chat 2021-11-19 22:16:06 Kinda just feels a little thin or way too thick really. With the half wedges it has that blocky shape to it too which isn‚Äôt fitting, but do as you see fit in the end lol

creations-chat 2021-11-19 22:21:04 I forgot to mention, you should put trails that are double cheeked up. Like one on top and one on the bottom, rather than the former but we‚Äôre past that

What‚Äôs this scam nonsense
creations-chat 2021-11-19 22:26:43 Looks like a terrible coincidence lol
creations-chat 2021-11-19 22:31:03 Yeah maybe I‚Äôm just used to seeing trails for those, or the triangular shape is what turns me off
