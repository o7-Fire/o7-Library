The Tale of spaceian (305085826604204033)
creations-chat 2019-09-24 22:19:10 Currently the only ground attacker that i've made that i'm happy with. Can take a bit of punishment, as i've flown it with an entire wing blown off and the tail gone. I don't feel like I deserve a rank for this, as it's purely built as a ground attacker and not for aesthetics. Block count is around 230-ish.
creations-chat 2019-09-24 22:20:23 cool.

bug-reports 2019-09-25 21:19:37 "reliability" of parts
creations-chat 2019-09-25 21:21:04 smol bomber, carries 3x impact tnt in a single bomb. No rank requested, as it's well under 100 parts.
creations-chat 2019-09-25 22:05:43 pretty cool
creations-chat 2019-09-25 22:12:39 wait, are these new ballast tanks controllable or something?
creations-chat 2019-09-25 22:15:47 interesting
creations-chat 2019-09-25 22:16:11 i don't think i can access the test server but i'll check it out once the update rolls onto the main server, i guess
creations-chat 2019-09-26 22:36:22 Pixy hummingbird to reset your game. ~150 blocks. No rank, as it's below 200 blocks.
creations-chat 2019-09-26 22:51:40 what designer rank can i get with this?

creations-chat 2019-09-26 22:55:20 am i capable of getting an aeronautical engineer rank for my ground attacker?
creations-chat 2019-09-26 22:55:55 as it's 223 blocks, technically making me eligible for AE1.
creations-chat 2019-09-26 22:56:30 wait but, am i eligible for aeronautical engineer 1?
creations-chat 2019-09-26 22:56:40 it is

creations-chat 2019-09-26 22:57:02 thats in the build mode
creations-chat 2019-09-26 22:57:41 it actually flies without helium, too
creations-chat 2019-09-26 22:59:33 creativ, it does fly
creations-chat 2019-09-26 23:00:03 i just screened it in the build mode, that's why. Here's an image of it flying, anyways.

creations-chat 2019-10-15 12:07:11 now you must make a ka-25 for it

creations-chat 2019-10-24 21:43:09 Remember that ground attacker from a month or two ago? Yeah, I've updated it. I won't post the block count, but it can turn faster than the hummingbird due to servo controls (i know it isn't anything new) but yeah updated it.
creations-chat 2019-10-24 23:44:29 h m
creations-chat 2019-10-24 23:44:52 it could be preferable
creations-chat 2019-10-24 23:45:06 if you were to remove 1000 from the block count you said it was to keep it accurate
creations-chat 2019-10-24 23:45:13 unless that was your goal

creations-chat 2019-12-18 13:11:42 and not a replica
creations-chat 2019-12-18 13:11:48 i could make some modifications to it on my own
creations-chat 2019-12-18 13:12:15 like giving it one big tailfin instead of 2 smaller ones on the edges
creations-chat 2019-12-18 13:12:41 exactly what i had on the sides of the wings
creations-chat 2019-12-18 13:13:03 thats what i plan on doing
creations-chat 2019-12-18 13:13:17 in fact, this is funny how all of my previous aircraft had yaw fuckery like this
creations-chat 2020-03-05 20:58:02 I feel like this will be the testbed for all of my weapons. The EXHT-01.

creations-chat 2020-04-07 19:47:00 tbh, i rather admire the people who are better than me, because i am aware of how bad my builds are lol
creations-chat 2020-04-07 19:48:12 yes im aware of the lack of enough control surfaces
creations-chat 2020-04-07 19:48:51 it's loosely based off a mig-29
creations-chat 2020-04-07 19:49:26 im prolly gonna be using servo controls as im trying to avoid doing windowblind wings
creations-chat 2020-04-07 19:52:25 lol
creations-chat 2020-04-07 19:52:37 ditching windowblind wings is a way im gonna get better
creations-chat 2020-04-07 20:02:52 motor 2 is a more advanced motor 1 lol
creations-chat 2020-04-07 20:03:04 motor 1 is more simple, but motor 2 has servo features, and the ability to follow the mouse
creations-chat 2020-04-07 20:03:35 you know what i'd love to see
creations-chat 2020-04-07 20:03:45 []x0.9 wings
creations-chat 2020-04-07 20:04:16 basically like the 1x0.9 block but instead its with wing blocks, allowing us to make better looking servo control surfaces
creations-chat 2020-04-07 20:11:26 <@!500443537389912074> that's really high quality
creations-chat 2020-04-07 20:18:02 front ones are canards
creations-chat 2020-04-07 20:18:06 rear ones are actually elevators
creations-chat 2020-04-07 20:18:54 basically
creations-chat 2020-04-07 20:19:04 they're like elevators but usually at the front
creations-chat 2020-04-07 20:19:39 well
creations-chat 2020-04-07 20:19:40 funny thing is
creations-chat 2020-04-07 20:19:45 my canards are my ailerons for some reason

creations-chat 2020-04-07 21:30:53 my fighter that i was posting a bit about above is losing some tail blocks that i've had to replace
creations-chat 2020-04-07 21:31:05 either it loses them
creations-chat 2020-04-07 21:31:09 or they're rotated
creations-chat 2020-04-07 21:55:12 wait thats not corruption with the deltas

creations-chat 2020-04-08 16:17:05 well here it is, the XF-8492 "Skystreak" Light fighter. Personally, I find it a fitting replacement for the XFA-17 "Hummingbird". She's more of a combatant, but I spent some time making her look better than the hummingbird too.
creations-chat 2020-04-08 16:20:37 Interestingly enough, she even uses cutter blocks in her construction which means i can ram people with this too lol

creations-chat 2020-05-15 20:43:30 my aesthetics skills are bad, but hey
creations-chat 2020-05-15 20:43:38 like
creations-chat 2020-05-15 20:43:49 it did take a bit of effort to fit the gunsight
creations-chat 2020-05-15 20:44:28 a majority of the fuselage on the plane i fit the gunsight on was 3m wide and 3m tall
creations-chat 2020-05-15 20:45:57 im still hoping that piston max force gets a buff so it's actually a reliable gunsight

creations-chat 2020-09-16 22:43:49 bruh moment.
creations-chat 2020-09-16 22:44:06 you're better off posting a single block than a shredder bug
creations-chat 2020-09-16 22:47:04 ^
creations-chat 2020-09-16 22:47:23 it is a better shredder, but you can't polish a turd and expect people to like it.
creations-chat 2020-09-16 23:51:27 Holy jesus.
creations-chat 2020-09-16 23:51:37 WHAT IS THAT?

creations-chat 2020-09-19 20:11:51 the big bridge
creations-chat 2020-11-19 22:15:55 ohno
creations-chat 2020-11-19 22:17:27 i feel a grave sense of danger, but hey. bad vehicle isn't a bad vehicle, merely a learning experience. yes the canards are massive. yes that's for aerodynamic balancing. yes i made it as a combat vehicle, wasn't really made to look too good.
creations-chat 2020-11-19 22:19:19 so the main complaint seems to be canards being fucking massive, i'll see what i can do. Any other feedback before I get back to work?
creations-chat 2020-11-19 22:21:16 wedges behind cockpit, alright. The missile placement is just a habit tbh, but I'll look into that too.
creations-chat 2020-11-19 22:24:18 Exposed motors, a h.... Got that. Intakes I was never really happy with, i need to change those. Engines are well, I'm yet to learn the technique for motor locking jets into rockets to make those look better, canopy again is something I really need to work on, Nose i'm unsure about again, but to be honest I don't mind the exposed motors for now considering that aircraft was the first time I ever used motor lock. ~~Also, what's with the 1 and a half minute slowmode~~ But anyways, yeah the motors need to be fixed
creations-chat 2020-11-19 22:26:37 <@!489910972946055172> when it comes to aesthetics my creation was already dead on arrival so...
creations-chat 2020-11-19 22:30:14 ~~i'm honestly not sure how to react, like the standards for good builds has gone through the fucking roof to the point i probably couldn't hope to improve. this is why i normally don't go for looks. But hey, feedback is feedback and this feedback makes me wanna improve.~~
creations-chat 2020-11-19 22:31:52 lmao you think that's bad when my stuff exists, i normally build for combat effective design rather than looks but hey this shitty EF2000 ripoff is rather good at PVP so ehh, i'm happy with it.
creations-chat 2020-11-19 22:33:52 <:welrodUnamused:681707039323324437>
stop trying to one up me in poorly made creations, death
creations-chat 2020-11-19 22:36:53 i mean i do wonder, is my shitty EF2000 ripoff considered low effort? probably is
creations-chat 2020-12-01 11:35:52 <:UH:668028831805734912>
creations-chat 2020-12-01 13:41:42 <@!468458118657867786> just a friendly reminder that maybe self upvoting isn't the best idea
creations-chat 2020-12-03 20:04:59 When it comes to building in my case, I just build. If I'm trying to replicate something, I'll usually have it loosely based on something real. In context to the updated version, All that was really changed was stuff around the cockpit, mainly trying to make the motor lock less obvious. Oh, and the overwing hardpoints were removed.
creations-chat 2020-12-03 20:11:29 I honestly always feel overwhelmed by the amount of stuff I have to learn just to make something that looks good. I just wanna enjoy building and I can't find the motivation to learn let alone build anything more than basic motor lock. I just wish I could make things that look good without having to bang my head on a wall for 25 minutes just for a small aesthetic improvement that probably wouldn't even matter in the first place. Then again, Plane Crazy isn't my home.
creations-chat 2020-12-04 14:42:06 H o t
creations-chat 2020-12-08 16:36:55 Wait a moment. Now I know that <#384025409945337856> is on looks but hear me out on this one <@456226577798135808>. You should use super rockets instead of jet engines for interior propulsion.
bot-central 2020-12-18 23:45:11 I dare say this

creations-chat 2020-12-18 23:57:36 <@!444221616524754954> i suggest not self upvoting, the community doesn't really appreciate self upvotes and it doesn't help you in any way

creations-chat 2021-01-05 14:39:39 To be honest, if there's one thing i don't particularly like about Maurinis' bismarck, is that i don't remember the real bismarck having a bulbous bow but maybe it's just me

creations-chat 2021-01-07 13:25:03 On another note, totally tempted to make VX-23 in the crimson squadron colours... <:Hmmmmmmmm:785037192502050816>
creations-chat 2021-01-08 16:03:07 <@!766841196534169612> Now, I'm not sure if you can do this due to weight balancing issues, but I slightly suggest moving those two large rockets back a block and then motor locking two jets of the same size into the original position of the rockets. That should hopefully look better, and there's more stuff i can't really talk about just yet due to music class starting back up! Good luck and have a nice day! Just a bit of feedback from me, aka probably the worst builder here
creations-chat 2021-01-08 16:05:33 Nah, i put time into my builds but i never really put effort into making them look particularly good. Especially my most recent designs. Older builds got me to designer 3
creations-chat 2021-01-09 01:04:40 You're welcome. <:ayyyyeee:757256135215546449>
creations-chat 2021-01-13 15:44:08 A little bit of a quick tip is try to motor lock an outline to the wing so it makes the jagged outline smoother. But that's just me.
