creations-chat 2021-12-26 20:08:22 damn i know my creation was bad i dont think it was THAT bad
creations-chat 2021-12-26 20:10:24 i would if i knew motorlock at all but i wont get anywhere if i dont try it atleast once
creations-chat 2021-12-26 21:23:14 Oh no I didnâ€™t mean it as a new discovery
creations-chat 2021-12-26 21:25:40 I meant it as very light usage of motor lock to put things into place as in a locked motor on the side skirts to pull em in or on the wheels to bring those in. nothing special
creations-chat 2021-12-26 21:29:50 motorlock with extra steps so yes
creations-chat 2021-12-26 21:32:26 honestly i dont classify my usage of it as motorlock so i just said "motorlock"
creations-chat 2021-12-26 21:36:50 that is some really good motorlock i cant even see the motor
creations-chat 2021-12-26 21:43:53 if i made it any shorter i would have a aneurism making the thing look right
creations-chat 2021-12-26 21:46:05 aha yeah no i dont know how to do normal motorlock anyway
creations-chat 2021-12-26 21:50:11 i am not allowed to speak on builds bc my builds are like d tier
creations-chat 2021-12-26 21:52:38 literally anything is better than me
creations-chat 2021-12-26 22:01:28 currently in vip 1 if someone wants to help me put some motorlock on my f1
