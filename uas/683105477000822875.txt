<@!720751430595772418> bruh i posted the rocket plane for my first test at building a hybrid
creations-chat 2020-11-07 21:14:30 > he acknowledges it looks bad but thinks its good because it goes fast??? lol🤢🤮
<@674434894616854548> nah, if I want a build to go fast all i need to do is make a plane structure, only wings and some thrusters at the end >->
creations-chat 2020-11-07 21:16:08 > Imagine caring about your own open opinion of someone else's creativity so much that you lose sight of what you think is good and become a terrible human person with a terrible personality and start shaming people who just wanted to share what they took time to create and just have a fun time.
<@344621799675265035> facts, it was ~~annoying~~ fun to make
creations-chat 2020-11-07 21:17:51 > Thats what you did lmao
<@430394898726780940> yeah, I went for those black army planes with huge wings but ended up failing so I made it randomly.
creations-chat 2020-11-07 21:19:43 > That looks nothing like a real plane
> No planes have 6 vertical stabilizers
> And like 4 different wings
<@720751430595772418> ik, this is the plane I tried going for but changing it due to it being heavy on the beak area.
creations-chat 2020-11-07 21:22:47 > this is legit your plane
<@430394898726780940> it isn't.. also where the f do you guys see the 4 front stabilizers
creations-chat 2020-11-07 21:24:19 > <@!683105477000822875>
<@720751430595772418> those are the wings not stabilizers > <@!683105477000822875>
<@430394898726780940> those are wings not stabilizers.. in total there are 8 wings
creations-chat 2020-11-07 21:26:33 > It could fly and such, but its gonna look shitty af
<@605240652413796352> yeah, the look is trash, as I said before, but it can fly
creations-chat 2020-11-07 21:28:51 > nobody gives a shit if it flies we want looks and functionality
<@458012038594166795> bruh it's function is that it can hover easily without the hover pads, and it's pretty stable while it does so, the only thing about it is that it works, I'll delete the whole thing and go tommorow for another look, the thing is that idk what to build, so I build the base of the plane, and from there I extend the build
creations-chat 2020-11-07 21:41:44 > aight ima head out of this server. <@!683105477000822875>  i hope you will continue the good work and i will challenge you to put literally as many wings as you can fit onto your plane because thats what made it so stable. Have fun building, and don't take this trash talk too personally. they have different standards.
@Thaverex#6749 alright, I'll make sure to put 20 wings on my next plane.
creations-chat 2020-11-07 21:44:18 Let me understand, so to get good votes, the workings don't matter, but the looks? <:Thonk:509498568982134816> <:thoink:657279634563399720>
creations-chat 2020-11-07 21:49:03 > U just need it to fly and look actually decent
<@674434894616854548> alr, then tell me what to build, send me a model of what you want me to build, and I'll do it
creations-chat 2020-11-07 21:57:06 How do people get warned? <:KEKW:670310537300672528>
creations-chat 2020-11-07 21:58:57 I'ma go to sleep, tommorow will be a **rough** day
creations-chat 2020-11-08 08:45:00 Then you lose the build

<@!652857275769421825> i meant Lockheed Martin C-130J Super Hercules
creations-chat 2020-11-08 09:29:15 > omfg that build is shit and too small
<@!484529511468236802> that's why i said it's a scaled down version 🤦 guess i gotta build the big version with details
creations-chat 2020-11-08 09:30:48 > it looks like a stick with wings imo, here is a blueprint of a C-130J to help with the shaping
<@!660019099430289418> thanks a lot bro, ima start working on it
creations-chat 2020-11-08 09:36:03 > What is that i saw that in my lobby
