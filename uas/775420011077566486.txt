creations-chat 2021-12-06 06:18:25 fair enough, i didnt really go off any schematics, just photos
creations-chat 2021-12-06 06:20:50 apologies for my plane not being up to you guys' standards, ill probably work on it more from this feedback, and id wish id get suggestions on how to fix it rather than being insulted about it, thanks.
creations-chat 2021-12-06 06:23:16 so much for advice good sir
creations-chat 2021-12-06 06:25:52 yeah i went off a few images, you can keep beating me down for it im not that experienced, i really like this community so far tbh, great first impressions and such
creations-chat 2021-12-06 06:28:04 i dont know im just scared of getting shut down again idk if i wanna improve rn
creations-chat 2021-12-06 06:30:45 ive been playing this game on my own without being in the discord for like a year and had little improvement
creations-chat 2021-12-06 06:33:09 well when most or majority of the community shits on you for using tutorials idk, i used all my motivation on this "eurofighter"
creations-chat 2021-12-06 06:35:57 <@!748820589933887539> i'd post this if it was any better than the eurofighter, its just a custom tank my friend helped me with
creations-chat 2021-12-06 06:40:09 i dont have the skill for tracks or anything like that üßç‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è best i can do is a few motors pertruding
creations-chat 2021-12-06 06:46:03 i can angle lock, the line going from the back of my cockpit down to the rudder is angle locked
creations-chat 2021-12-06 07:28:08 alright ill try it thanks, and ill try to angle lock the size to narrow in to the tail
creations-chat 2021-12-06 23:15:53 <@!748820589933887539> progress on my new version
creations-chat 2021-12-06 23:26:09 what era of halo is this pelican in
creations-chat 2021-12-06 23:35:20 im working on a new eurofighter i hope this nose and cockpit makes u guys happy üßç‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
creations-chat 2021-12-06 23:37:22 im covering it with disconnectors its the base for where my seat is and its gonna be covered by the fuselage anyway, i just made this in like 15 minutes
creations-chat 2021-12-06 23:43:14 i probably will, i'd have to replace some motor with a spring and then have the cockpit go bye bye
creations-chat 2021-12-06 23:46:50 depends
creations-chat 2021-12-06 23:49:43 what "future" are you going for
creations-chat 2021-12-06 23:56:10 i like the right but it looks like that one sukhoi, maybe try a fat wing like an avro vulcan but just alter it a little?
creations-chat 2021-12-07 00:02:32 yeah use signs and maybe use a motor to set them at an angle? ( <@!757760986848559256> i like the top one)
creations-chat 2021-12-07 00:11:27 1st one, and <@!375281006091173890> fixed some imperfections i hope this makes you happy
creations-chat 2021-12-07 00:13:32 yes  the rear wedge will soon be normal block and hide a motor, <@!757760986848559256> i pinged u cuz u asked me smthn
