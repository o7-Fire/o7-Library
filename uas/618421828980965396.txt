creations-chat 2022-09-01 12:18:52 buddy, before i go off on you and get banned like i was banned a while ago, I would like you to know that it is 1.4k parts, heavily motorlocked and has a ton of angled motorlock, so i wouldn’t call it “bad”. The nose has a lot of twisting nose parts, and that was very hard to paint because the paint had to be in the right place which makes it look wonky. Everything else is better, ill try making the nose better cuz its my first time ever making such a pointy nose. ☺️
creations-chat 2022-09-01 12:28:00 cuz im ukrainian 😳😳😳😱
creations-chat 2022-09-01 12:37:57 no i agree but its like trying to get a picture of a school bus when ur 2 feet away from it with a phone.. its a f-104, its long. plus some people just HAVE to be bitchy about everything.
creations-chat 2022-09-01 13:02:45 Literally calm down, its like i commited a crime or something... its not your build.. dont like it just downvote god damn 💀  this community still toxic since 2020

creations-chat 2022-09-02 17:09:16 why is jiamy such a arse? his blackbird has exposed motorlock on its sides and he gonna downvote builds that look 100x better than his? what a way to brighten the community bud
creations-chat 2022-09-06 02:49:37 🤓  etposed motor lock 🤓
creations-chat 2022-09-06 04:30:31 The F-104S.ASA is an italian modified version of the american F-104. It isnt the only varient. There is the Italian F-104G, F-104S, German F-104G, F-104A, etc. So yes, i did put an italian emoji because it is italian.
creations-chat 2022-09-06 05:03:08 😭😭 i was lazy so i jus put half blocks, its so much more weight and parts to make them round, plus the intakes are small. Its something ill try doing later cuz i just dont know what to do.
creations-chat 2022-09-06 05:17:19 the plane is already at 1.6k parts and im afraid to make it higher because i wont be able to go faster, without shaking

creations-chat 2023-04-12 12:45:20 I like how ppl with garbage builds will downvote everything
creations-chat 2023-04-12 12:49:29 Id have to disagree with you jeff. It is a tiny vehicle, i personally find the gun impressive, and the compact design. The color could be a little more dull and he could make the material metallic.
creations-chat 2023-05-07 03:14:51 whats the point of making new cruise missiles, just convert a couple f16s into kamikaze drones
