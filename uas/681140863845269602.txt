plane-crazy 2020-07-27 16:52:31 that took 3 days
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 16:52:24 CAS hull is a nightmare duckdx
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 16:51:49 it's just a cloned and upscaled CAS
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 16:51:37 with passion
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 16:51:34 I hate the ORS covenant super carrier
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 16:50:43 I'm joking you crazy guy, I said something ridiculous to throw off your brain
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 16:49:51 nah
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 16:49:31 :(
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 16:49:27 I don't make friends
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 16:49:02 or discord mods actually
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 16:48:57 like the devs care XD
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 16:48:31 there's no space ship rank so I'm going to turn this into a Vtol and get expert Vtol engineer rank
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 15:20:33 thanks for that
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 15:19:36 ok good
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 15:18:53 does it not delete the build until I leave the game that goes over the save limit <@!518454798190772224>
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 15:18:27 but little deer I'm over the save data limit
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 15:18:10 and so I have 3 alts now
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 15:17:56 I switched accounts a while ago
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 15:17:47 no this is my new main
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 15:17:41 or wait
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 15:17:33 this is my alt
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 15:16:58 uuhhhhhhhh
so I'm at 165.something save data used
so the only way to delete a build to make space is the unload the CAS and load a different build and then save it as an empty plot
but if I unload it does it just reset to the way it was before?
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 15:16:47 can you answer my question <@!518454798190772224>
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 15:14:33 uuhhhhhhhh

plane-crazy 2020-07-26 07:01:36 Are YOU in need of absolutely massive tree cutting services but can't do it yourself because of a 9-foot-tall native alien population trying to stop you from mining a rare metal under their home? WELL YOU NEED THE DRAGON C-21 GUNSHIP TODAY
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 21:03:06 leave them to their own devices
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 21:02:42 the spam cars
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 21:02:38 the shredder bugs
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 21:02:10 but nothing with the commoners
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 21:02:00 I do 1v1s in organized battles
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 21:01:31 no
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 21:01:13 also I use those ropes on the sides
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 21:00:58 I use folds to make my masts taller at the cost of looking as smooth
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 21:00:23 perfection
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 21:00:17 yes
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 20:59:59 on my magnets theory or the pirate battle <@163143541160148992> ?
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 20:54:02 however it still pushes and stuff
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 20:53:50 the weld completely stops working
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 20:53:40 that's because magnets break if you have a large creation
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 20:53:22 lol
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 20:53:16 turn on weld
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 20:51:38 anyone up for a pirate ship battle?
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 18:47:52 that's totally normal lol
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 18:47:44 yep
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 17:03:40 read <#609442446249820211>
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 17:02:43 and if you don't respond within 5 minutes of a mod dming you you forfeit the rank
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 17:02:15 despite qualifying for shipwright IV and designer I think either I-II, I'm not sure it's worth my time to apply because you have to make a video and stuff
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 17:01:15 the rank application process seems a it intense to me
plane-crazy 2020-06-12 02:03:07 I joined the community finally because I heard someone built the Unsc Infinity, I want his name so I can kek him with my covenant super carrier
