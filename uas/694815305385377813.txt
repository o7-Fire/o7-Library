creations-chat 2020-12-18 14:47:59 can i get some feedback on my Ta 152?
creations-chat 2020-12-18 14:50:10 its a Ta 152 its front is very long
creations-chat 2020-12-18 14:54:12 i think i will do that cause looking at it the plane does look weird, its gonna be hard to stomp the engines in the plane tho
creations-chat 2020-12-18 15:12:56 I shortened the nose anything else i should improve on y Ta 152?
