creations-chat 2022-12-12 08:26:43 I just have a guided missile that can go quite fast. When I was making it I kept shredders in mind. It is very long and simple.
creations-chat 2022-12-12 08:29:34 I have an idea
creations-chat 2022-12-12 08:32:22 Fast plane that shoots magnets with smoke dispensers on and hits the shredder, It might lag them or just annoy them. You could also just make a portable lag machine and attach it to the shredder so that only they get affected by it.
creations-chat 2022-12-12 08:36:17 Everybody can then just blacklist you can't they? What would you do then? And even so, wouldn't trying to get somebody who is trying to counter you be fun?
creations-chat 2022-12-12 08:38:52 I haven't as I am only aware of annoying people with super fast cutter flying things going into PVP servers and killing everybody just going about their bussiness.
creations-chat 2022-12-12 08:41:22 Good idea, just make it really deep, or even make a compact one and put it in the little underwater hole and give it guns and stuff
creations-chat 2022-12-12 08:43:46 Is there a group for anti-shredders?
creations-chat 2022-12-12 08:46:34 Ok ok, what is the actual anti-shredder group?
creations-chat 2022-12-12 08:49:02 <@862160384206962749> Are you part of an anti-shredder group?

creations-chat 2022-12-12 09:03:42 What is ASC?
creations-chat 2022-12-12 09:38:44 Exactly what I was asking

creations-chat 2022-12-12 09:48:55 shhhhh
creations-chat 2022-12-12 09:58:00 I have made a guided missile
creations-chat 2022-12-12 10:00:01 oh, you prob need magnets for that
help 2022-12-23 23:18:23 This question is mostly just general Roblox, but Plane Crazy is one of the games where it is really annoying; I am on a Chromebook, it can be a tablet or a laptop, and Roblox acts like it is a mobile device, which is really annoying considering it easily can be used as a laptop, so I have mobile UI and stuff and the controls get all weird. Does anybody have any tips?(P.S: The Chromebook uses ChromeOS, not Windows or stuff and I cannot run a separate operating system because of enterprise restrictions.)
help 2022-12-23 23:20:23 Also, sorry for all the commas, I think use them a bit much.
help 2022-12-23 23:28:03 Now how do I get a colour role?
help 2022-12-23 23:28:40 This white is kinda bland
help 2022-12-24 08:56:50 You must have some accessibilitly settings on that does that when you press the tab key
