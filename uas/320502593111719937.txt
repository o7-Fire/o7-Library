bug-reports 2020-09-06 06:40:00 I've discovered a new glitch for parachutes.
When you pressed the parachute button while falling, your avatar may glitch and fell in the void.

creations-chat 2020-11-21 15:09:42 I was gonna ask why you downvotes and how can I improve the train lol


⬇️  Thx btw
creations-chat 2020-11-21 15:57:41 Hmmm, cool details.exe


And yes, I painted the wall into glass to showcase what's inside the train
Basically just a huge V16 engine, bunch of electric cabinets and a huge engine cooling plant
creations-chat 2020-11-21 16:04:35 Hmmm, that might be a good Idea btw

The down side is that, I'll have to rebuild the entire side of the train

⬇️  Half ballast tank don't exist and I used cutters for the vents
creations-chat 2020-11-21 16:07:35 Mk
creations-chat 2020-11-21 16:09:09 Here's how I made the vent, just cutter and blocks
creations-chat 2020-11-21 16:12:12 ⬆️ Uh.. Those vents were actually horizontal
creations-chat 2020-11-21 16:14:20 As you can see here
creations-chat 2020-11-21 16:16:42 Sadly, I cannot add those handrails at the side of the train (which is right next to the headlamp) :/
creations-chat 2020-11-21 16:18:15 As I don't have enough space to fit motor locking and stuff there :/
creations-chat 2020-11-21 16:26:28 Hm.. Okay
creations-chat 2020-11-21 16:27:59 Hmmmm, the problem is that, it's gonna block the aisle for people to check the engine tho
creations-chat 2020-11-21 16:30:34 I'd keep the functions and stuff
creations-chat 2020-11-21 16:32:42 Lemme just try fitting the motors below the train body

I guess
creations-chat 2020-11-21 16:35:03 Erm...
My train is not really that tall and there aren't that many space for me to fit those motor locking mech...

I guess I have to sacrifice something, which will be the outside of the train
creations-chat 2020-11-21 16:40:19 Anyways, thanks for your advice
creations-chat 2020-11-21 16:41:51 ??
creations-chat 2020-11-21 16:43:57 Uhm.... I'm afraid that this might not fit as well...
The front part of the train is already touching the border of the plot
creations-chat 2020-11-21 16:47:13 Anyways, thanks for your advice!
creations-chat 2020-11-22 17:38:37 Thx!

bug-reports 2020-12-11 14:49:05 Recently, my friend discovered a brand new glitch. When you spawned a large build. You can actually move the build without it being fully loaded. As a result, the blocks will glitch into random places.
bug-reports 2020-12-11 14:56:05 And yes, this glitch still exists (Discovered by <@513528243886882840> )

creations-chat 2020-12-17 18:58:37 Legacy glass: Visible text
Normal glass: Vanished text

When you place text and stuff behind legacy glass and you look at it. It won't vanish.
But if you did the same thing with normal glass though, the text block will be vanished.

⬇️ ?
creations-chat 2020-12-17 19:08:20 (The picture isn't mine, it's just me giving an example of how people use legacy glass on their builds)
I've seen someone used legacy glass for their destination displays. The text will still show up as you seen in the picture, unlike normal glass.


⬇️ Yes, if you use it wisely.
creations-chat 2020-12-17 19:12:00 It depends how you use that material. If you spam a shit ton of legacy glass on your build, it will be ugly.

creations-chat 2021-09-20 11:57:57 As you can see, it will NOT fit and looks awful if I mod it

You still need to do something completely by yourself
Modifying a tutorial is like finishing your work by copying other's work, then modify
It still counts as you finishing your work but you just can't learn anything and rely on this kind of habit
creations-chat 2022-08-02 15:17:29 Oh wow really?

You can motorlock the missiles and add glass to the canopy
Perhaps you can also add a few more details on the plane
It's really up to you
The coloring is rather odd, you can check out some images online

Basically, I can't speak English fluently before
creations-chat 2022-08-13 20:42:39 I think he can't speak / understand English fluently, should I help him translate????
creations-chat 2022-08-13 20:45:26 Where?
I guess he kinda used Google translate or something
creations-chat 2022-08-13 20:47:30 He's offline after I asked him some questions in Chinese 💀
Most likely won't read your message at the moment due to the fact that it's 4AM here (I guess it's the same for him)
creations-chat 2022-08-13 21:04:28 <@930842770992668773>

Would be nice if you made the interior for the car as well

creations-chat 2022-08-13 21:10:54 Well, instead of posting the WIP car in <#384025409945337856> , you're supposed to it here
Otherwise, you'll receive warnings for posting WIP builds in <#384025409945337856>
