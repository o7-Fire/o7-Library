plane-crazy 2020-07-23 22:53:17 The Half Wedge 2 is nice to
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 22:52:52 The 0.9 block isnt the best for every problem..
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 18:21:52 If there will be any helpfull blocks for that jet..
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 18:21:22 Or I'm just gonna wait 1 year for some new blocks to help..
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 18:20:06 But there isnt a good look for the upper 1 block gap
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 18:19:31 I can get rid of the 0.5 block gap
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 18:19:17 I know that bruh
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 18:18:50 I know but I want that 1 block gap to disappear
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 18:17:29 I can use that in that case
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 18:17:23 yeah if I want my Eurofighter to looks shit
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 18:16:42 there isnt any super adjustabe blocs..
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 18:16:20 what is that?
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 18:14:21 And this keeps me from finishing the plane

plane-crazy 2020-07-23 18:13:21 
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 18:13:15 There is a 1 block gap I cant get rid of, when I lower the pistons for the wings and If I put a block there the pistons will dont work
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 18:12:25 Heyy I'm having a problem with my Eurofighter.
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 10:59:32 I forgot about the 0.9 block..
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 10:59:00 I forgot about that..
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 10:58:03 I'm using, but I still want it to look good and still realistic
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 10:57:13 I know the locked motors, but there isnt a good way for that at meh
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 10:56:32 Vip, but it will looks shity, so I cant do it
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 10:55:53 Just I dont like that we dont have options to change the blocks gluing place?
Like we cant create more complex mechanisms
Where can I post my idea for a new update to the game?

There isnt a way to do this:
