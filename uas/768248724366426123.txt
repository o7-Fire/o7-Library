help 2022-12-04 00:34:25 Sup, I need help with my creations.

I recently played on an iPad that got sold, and I now play on my mobile phone, but due to the large screen difference, the buttons for me to move are out-with my screen, and so I am unable to see or use the buttons to control my builds.

Is there a button reset setting or anything that I can use to reset the buttons to the centre of my screen?
