help 2019-06-08 03:38:01 Someone know how to properly hitch a train and traincar?
creations-chat 2019-06-08 04:11:58 *Toot toot, ready to pick you up.*
creations-chat 2019-06-08 04:18:09 Oh yeah, also if I could get the **Advanced** role for Train Conductor. All of these are above or at five blocks long (including the caboose) and I was able to drive around the track, but the caboose wanted to give some issues.
creations-chat 2019-06-08 04:24:22 Also, possibly the **modeler** role? This has over 500 bricks, don't exactly know if it's 'unique', but it has seats and whatnot, and it's pretty cool.
creations-chat 2019-06-08 04:35:55 Thanks. :^)

creations-chat 2019-06-09 21:42:47 **The Tsar Tank, "Netopyr" (the name is ironic.)**
Designed and experimented with during the early years of World War One (1914-1915), the 'tank', technically classified as an armored car, never saw action, because unlike the German tanks in 1945, they deemed it was 'too large of a target for artillery.'

Man, the Germans should've learned from "huge machine" in war idea.

creations-chat 2019-06-10 18:26:09 i **really** don't know
creations-chat 2019-06-11 21:08:43 *Wow, it's a Schwerer Gustav, sooooo original!*

The giant gun on the train idea from Germany was recreated in a lego game. Nice... ðŸ‘€ 

Anywho, this train doesn't exactly handle corners well, but that's the point. The real life counterpart almost always needed a straight rail system, or it would not move. So, I guess that's realistic.

The gun barrel would've been longer, had it not been for the fact that I'm still a **noob** when it comes to a lot of things, and the folding mechanism ruined the *aesthetic* of the barrel, so thus, it's shortened. Other than that, yeah.
