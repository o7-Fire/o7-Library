creations-chat 2023-07-02 15:25:42 blame how small pc plots are
creations-chat 2023-07-02 15:27:45 the helicopter itself takes up more than 70% of the plot length
creations-chat 2023-07-02 15:30:18 Also the AH-1Z model that I used for the build is practically the same length of my heli so idk what youre on about
creations-chat 2023-07-02 15:33:36 if youre gonna shit on random people because their build isnt as perfect as you want it to be then I'd like to see you build a better ah-1z in the same 3 hours that I spent building mine
creations-chat 2023-07-02 15:43:10 You need 2 rotors on top of eachother, one to provide lift for the helicopter and one to counter the torque of the main rotor
creations-chat 2023-07-02 15:46:26 this is what I do but theres also another way to stop your heli from spinning by adding a tail rotor (which is very vulnerable in pvp) to counter the torque and also provide horizontal stabilization and movement of the tail of the helicopter
creations-chat 2023-07-02 15:48:54 This is what I use on my heli

I can also link a helicopter basics video if it will let me

If your helicopter is decently long or heavy then I recommend putting 2 of these co-ax rotors on the far ends of the center of gravity on your vehicle so its easy to control
creations-chat 2023-07-02 16:18:17 Tandem rotor
creations-chat 2023-07-02 16:20:29 its changing direction because the heli is too light

I recommend changing the materials to metal which is more durable in pvp and heavier, or removing helium blocks
creations-chat 2023-07-02 16:26:11 <@982238041445900348> 

this can also be because your helicopter is unfinished and just very small so I recommend building the helicopter itself THEN adding the rotor where it needs to be added

the center of gravity constantly changes whenever you add a block on to your build so its much better to finish your build first and then add the rotors
creations-chat 2023-07-02 19:02:11 oh mb

creations-chat 2023-07-02 20:24:23 a box
creations-chat 2023-07-02 22:14:42 Can someone help on what to do here?

I'm making an aircraft carrier but I don't think I will have enough space to install the superstructure. I set up a pole to measure the plot height limit and it appears that I'm reaching the top of the plot

I can't stop building more layers because when the build is unfolded, it appears to be very short and obviously requires more length

I also put an image of the reference im using for my build
creations-chat 2023-07-02 22:16:56 ignore the fact that the runway is inverted and on the opposite side
creations-chat 2023-07-02 22:19:16 actually though what do I do in that situation

there is a very high chance I wont be able to fit in the superstructure
creations-chat 2023-07-02 22:22:35 I'll try motorlocking the superstructure
creations-chat 2023-07-02 23:04:32 since rebuilding the entire build would have more downsides than upsides at this point and there isnt enough space for motorlocking I'll try to integrate the superstructure into the hull of the ship

If I make the motor locks any smaller or more space efficient than they already are then I would not be able to make my aircraft carrier pvp-capable or have some of the features it has on it atm

said features include having a 1:1 scale superstructure and some of the markings it has on

I own an aircraft carrier with 4 sections, all using anchor blocks to hold themselves together while spawned in, as well as a functioning catapult system

The problem is that I need physics to be turned on in order for the catapult to work, otherwise I have to quickly unlock the anchors, activate the catapult, and lock them again.

The problem with physics mode is that its extremely buggy and does not function when more than 2 blocks from another persons vehicle is on the carrier, but if I do the other method where I quickly unlock anchors, the carrier has a tendency to freak out when I do that.

Is there a way I can fix this bug?

overall your build looks great though
creations-chat 2023-07-06 00:59:57 I also recommend adding a working catapult system to your carrier, its fairly easy (literally just add a line of trap doors that you can open and close to launch aircraft using thrust revving)

bug-reports 2023-07-06 02:08:44 whenever I load in my unfinished B-52 stratofortress in plane crazy and try to accelerate it, the motor folding begins to shake uncontrollably and completely break the entire build.
This happens every time I try to move it, locked motors or not. It gets worse when I'm in a public server or am lagging an excessive amount

Debug menu screenshot:
https://i.gyazo.com/d586c028746f73722140ff38f45044cc.png

The bug happens specifically on my B-52, which is over 3000 blocks and causes tolerable lag increase when spawned in and/or unanchored, so it is likely that it can be reproduced via spawning in a large build that uses wing folding including motors and wing panels.

https://medal.tv/games/roblox/clips/1hWiXGknTWagyy/d1337FDfWCZ3?invite=cr-MSxrZkYsMTYyNjg1ODE0LA

Note: *In the video, the larger parts of the wings have unlocked motors, as well as the motors connecting the main airframe. This is because locking the motors seemingly do not help at all, and only prevent it from breaking apart __in my private server__. The wingtip folds are locked, however, as they seemingly worsen when the motors are unlocked.*

creations-chat 2023-07-06 02:31:45 the wings are connected via a single camera  and motor, attached to a row of half-wedges in order for them to sit flush on the top of the plane

there is a small cavity in the fuselage in order to prevent the half-wedges from colliding and not sitting correctly

creations-chat 2023-07-07 01:46:50 plane crazy's shitty ass optimization makes it lag whenever I use ANY other engine that isn't either a magnet engine or conveyor

the downsides of using those 2 engines is they are shit for use on bomber/heavy aircraft
creations-chat 2023-07-07 01:49:57 I have the engine set to a configuration where the max speed is 900 sps

the thing is that I have to hold down the button for accelerating in order to maintain speed, making landing and pvp unrealistic to even think of doing
creations-chat 2023-07-07 01:53:34 anyway should I keep trying or should I start from scratch and make something smaller

creations-chat 2023-07-12 16:53:40 I recommend motorlocking the cockpit window so you can add more detail to it

creations-chat 2023-07-12 16:55:44 in that case try to make the cockpit blend more with the airframe of the helicopter so it fits flush and doesnt look so blocky

e.g use half blocks
creations-chat 2023-07-12 20:03:56 pretty good ngl
creations-chat 2023-07-12 20:24:57 is the plane done?
what type of aircraft is it? what you should add to it depends on its main role

bomber or fighter? <@396515096693833729>
creations-chat 2023-07-12 20:28:13 add some sort of vertical stabilizer so that it will maneuver well in combat
creations-chat 2023-07-12 20:30:54 can it perform an instantaneous 9g turn in less than 5 seconds

if it can't then I recommend making the stabilizer bigger and adjusting the control surfaces' sensitivity as you will most likely be doing that alot while dogfighting in pvp
creations-chat 2023-07-12 20:33:27 an instant 9g turn is when you roll the aircraft 90 degrees to the left or right and turn to either side using only your elevators
creations-chat 2023-07-12 20:35:36 <@396515096693833729> this is an instantaneous 9g turn

having to perform a maneuver like this in combat, especially in dogfighting is practically guaranteed
