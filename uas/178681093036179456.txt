plane-crazy 2020-07-01 20:15:57 zeppelin with a shit ton of bombs coming soon to a theatre near you
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 19:38:53 i beg
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 19:38:49 please rick man ice cone
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 19:38:12 I was hoping that wouldnt be the case
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 19:37:53 Alrighty then.
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 19:37:49 I was hoping it would have something to do ballast.
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 19:37:18 Ive tried using helium and ballast tanks, but it doesnt work.
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 19:37:08 How do zeppelins manage to rise and lower?
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 05:23:54 I bet he thinks the front wings control pitch
plane-crazy 2020-06-28 06:08:45 it’s a missle
plane-crazy 2020-06-28 06:08:42 if it’s guided
plane-crazy 2020-06-28 06:08:36 it’s a rocket
plane-crazy 2020-06-28 06:08:32 if its not guided
plane-crazy 2020-06-28 02:33:00 Cant
plane-crazy 2020-06-28 02:27:54 fat bruh
plane-crazy 2020-06-28 02:22:48 them some big rockets
plane-crazy 2020-06-28 02:18:30 that answers the question
plane-crazy 2020-06-28 02:18:18 https://gyazo.com/d2e101ca627b7bafd3668d1c7feaed8a
plane-crazy 2020-06-28 02:11:51 Should I do a standard wooden deck or a prussian steel deck?
plane-crazy 2020-06-28 02:11:41 Kek

plane-crazy 2020-06-26 18:15:31 Cause I have a midget sub
plane-crazy 2020-06-26 18:15:16 Can I still get the submarine commander role?
plane-crazy 2020-06-26 18:14:09 You gonna learn today spongebob
plane-crazy 2020-06-26 18:13:57 But with 405mm guns
plane-crazy 2020-06-26 18:13:45 The Flying Dutchman
plane-crazy 2020-06-26 18:13:41 I should add hover engines to it on the bottom
plane-crazy 2020-06-26 18:13:22 I wanna turn, not do the kaiser funky and go flying
plane-crazy 2020-06-26 18:10:48 So now the turning blows mega
plane-crazy 2020-06-26 18:10:35 It doesn’t help that my big brain added a second layer to the inside of the hull to allow it to tank explosives and torpedoes
plane-crazy 2020-06-26 18:09:17 Because planes are the big weakness right now
plane-crazy 2020-06-26 18:09:09 Used to have secondary guns embedded in the hull but got rid of them to allow the building of anti air
plane-crazy 2020-06-26 18:08:45 10 rocket deck guns, 2 per turret for a total of 4 turrets
plane-crazy 2020-06-26 18:08:03 But it’s a German dreadnought with a German naval jack flag
plane-crazy 2020-06-26 18:07:50 The hull looks very similar to that of the RN dreadnought
plane-crazy 2020-06-26 18:07:38 It’s a mix of German and British dreadnought designs
plane-crazy 2020-06-26 18:07:06 I’m working on deck mounted torpedo tubes for it aswell
plane-crazy 2020-06-26 18:06:54 I see someone and they get nae naed
plane-crazy 2020-06-26 18:06:49 Like a proper ass clapper of a dreadnought
plane-crazy 2020-06-26 18:06:35 It’s a big boy
plane-crazy 2020-06-26 18:06:27 I’ve tried that
plane-crazy 2020-06-26 18:06:23 It’s about 3780 blocks
plane-crazy 2020-06-26 18:06:11 I am
plane-crazy 2020-06-26 18:05:53 But even with hidden propellers, rockets, 2 external rudders, the turning is shit
plane-crazy 2020-06-26 18:05:38 It goes at about 20 knots which I’m fine with
plane-crazy 2020-06-26 18:05:30 I got this proper phat dreadnought
plane-crazy 2020-06-26 18:05:06 I need a lad to answer a big boat question
plane-crazy 2020-06-26 18:04:47 I need a boat guy
plane-crazy 2020-06-26 00:56:28 I have 2 rudders, hidden water propellors, rockets, everything
plane-crazy 2020-06-26 00:56:12 Any suggestions for getting a massive behemoth of a ship to turn faster?
plane-crazy 2020-06-24 00:24:47 I still want to do that massive multi player bridge across the lake.
plane-crazy 2020-06-23 23:59:11 Even when Im using beams
plane-crazy 2020-06-23 23:59:03 Guessing 3000-3500+ block count when finished.
plane-crazy 2020-06-23 23:58:29 Not even a full 2/3 of the way done and its 1500 blocks.
plane-crazy 2020-06-23 23:45:16 Like, is metal stronger than wood?
plane-crazy 2020-06-23 23:45:11 Do materials have an effect on strength?
plane-crazy 2020-06-23 23:40:45 Do rockets set off explosives?
plane-crazy 2020-06-23 23:40:30 Just to make this thing able to tank shots
plane-crazy 2020-06-23 23:40:22 If I have enough blocks, im double layering the hull.
plane-crazy 2020-06-23 23:37:36 Time for a twelve motor setup just to get this beast of a dreadnought moving
plane-crazy 2020-06-23 23:34:16 Also, do the propellor blades work underwater too?
plane-crazy 2020-06-23 23:34:05 Or that you dont even need ballast blocks to assist
plane-crazy 2020-06-23 23:33:57 Just because of the shear weight
plane-crazy 2020-06-23 23:33:52 And you get that warm feeling when you can stand on the port and starboard side without it tipping
plane-crazy 2020-06-23 23:33:39 Do you ever just make a massive ship
plane-crazy 2020-06-23 21:35:54 how to they work
plane-crazy 2020-06-23 21:35:51 nevermind
plane-crazy 2020-06-23 21:28:29 figured it out
plane-crazy 2020-06-23 21:28:27 nvm
plane-crazy 2020-06-23 21:26:55 Idk
plane-crazy 2020-06-23 21:26:09 Someone mind helping me on that one?
plane-crazy 2020-06-23 21:26:00 I have yet to figure out magnets
plane-crazy 2020-06-22 16:21:16 Yeah but why have “legitimate” options when I can just be an asshole and catch them in nets
plane-crazy 2020-06-22 16:20:58 That sounds really fucking cool
plane-crazy 2020-06-22 16:20:51 I meant the ship itself
plane-crazy 2020-06-22 16:20:20 It pushes people lighso
plane-crazy 2020-06-22 16:20:08 Do you mind showing me?
plane-crazy 2020-06-22 16:19:46 When you see the top buoys start to jiggle and dive under you’ve found your target
plane-crazy 2020-06-22 16:19:30 Or it’s a trap
plane-crazy 2020-06-22 16:19:23 That way if an enemy sub is chasing you they get tangled and slowed down
plane-crazy 2020-06-22 16:19:14 When released, it floats behind
plane-crazy 2020-06-22 16:19:09 Right now I’m trying to design a massive net you can place on the back of a warship
plane-crazy 2020-06-22 16:18:18 That would be nice to not have that happen
plane-crazy 2020-06-22 16:18:12 Yeah
plane-crazy 2020-06-22 16:18:03 Or just have a massive fucking arm that is on a motor that swivels back and forth and if it stops moving you hit something
plane-crazy 2020-06-22 16:17:44 If simpler games can have it work, I think the lads in development could get it to work
plane-crazy 2020-06-22 16:16:38 So go suggest it
plane-crazy 2020-06-22 16:16:35 I mean, your ranked
plane-crazy 2020-06-22 16:15:54 With a little GUI on your screen
plane-crazy 2020-06-22 16:15:43 Gimme sonar block
plane-crazy 2020-06-22 16:14:36 Water jet engine
plane-crazy 2020-06-22 16:14:02 And just bitch slap missles
plane-crazy 2020-06-22 16:13:56 You could cover a massive plane in them
plane-crazy 2020-06-22 16:12:09 It’s just a cool factor thing
plane-crazy 2020-06-22 16:12:05 You could make flares without smoke and have them still work
plane-crazy 2020-06-22 16:11:53 The blocks themselves
plane-crazy 2020-06-22 16:11:47 Not smoke attracting people
plane-crazy 2020-06-22 16:10:31 Then it would just kinda shoot off in a direction of kill the flare
plane-crazy 2020-06-22 16:10:19 It should theoretically get closer to the tracking area for the rocket than the plane itself
plane-crazy 2020-06-22 16:10:00 If it’s hot on your ass and you fire one
plane-crazy 2020-06-22 16:09:51 But close tracking rockets
plane-crazy 2020-06-22 16:09:46 Because you don’t see a flare and go wooga booga
plane-crazy 2020-06-22 16:09:35 Not player guided ones
plane-crazy 2020-06-22 16:06:17 There are tutorials
plane-crazy 2020-06-22 16:06:11 Disconnectors, red lights, smoke
plane-crazy 2020-06-22 16:04:58 But you can make them
plane-crazy 2020-06-22 16:04:54 No
plane-crazy 2020-06-22 16:04:50 Because of the fact there are pre built autonomous tracking missiles
plane-crazy 2020-06-22 16:04:39 But I haven’t realized how useful they could be in game
plane-crazy 2020-06-22 16:04:28 I know that
plane-crazy 2020-06-22 16:04:25 With manual guided missiles your still fucked
plane-crazy 2020-06-22 16:04:02 That can stop tracking rockets from tracking you and going straight for the flare instead
plane-crazy 2020-06-22 16:03:34 I’ve just now realized how useful flares can be
plane-crazy 2020-06-04 17:03:18 <:jonahs1Nervous:706974921711943691> im gonna shit my pants
plane-crazy 2020-06-04 17:00:54 Im assuming thats a shredder bug
plane-crazy 2020-06-04 17:00:47 The thinks that fly everywhere and either are explosive or covered in cutters
plane-crazy 2020-06-04 16:59:38 I hate the god damn apes who use the snakes and camp spawns
plane-crazy 2020-06-04 01:10:17 Ngl I kinda want to make a landing craft
plane-crazy 2020-06-04 01:08:05 How would those work?
plane-crazy 2020-06-04 01:07:31 Then how would we connect and dock it?
plane-crazy 2020-06-04 01:07:20 Do magnets stick to other peoples magnets?
plane-crazy 2020-06-04 01:06:43 Im not sure if it would work
plane-crazy 2020-06-04 01:06:36 What if we had a massive group project wherein we constructed a bridge connecting the dock to the lunar area
plane-crazy 2020-06-02 19:35:59 If I place a guided middle inside a bomb bay, will the control surfaces still have an effect on the plane?
plane-crazy 2020-06-01 19:17:37 Just a demonstration showing how it works
plane-crazy 2020-06-01 19:17:24 Well, not really
plane-crazy 2020-06-01 19:17:18 Theres how the wings will look.
plane-crazy 2020-06-01 19:17:08 https://gyazo.com/6d1b6c1ff87043d4deadf2e7d5f5c0bc
plane-crazy 2020-06-01 19:14:35 Thanks
plane-crazy 2020-06-01 19:12:29 Can someone tell me what angle the 1x4 delta wing is at?
plane-crazy 2020-06-01 19:09:38 Alright.
plane-crazy 2020-06-01 19:09:25 This lad?
plane-crazy 2020-06-01 19:08:06 This?
plane-crazy 2020-06-01 19:07:31 I was thinking a B-25 Mitchell
plane-crazy 2020-06-01 19:07:06 What should I build now?
plane-crazy 2020-06-01 19:07:02 I already did a XP-82, Spitfire, B17, and a B18A.
plane-crazy 2020-06-01 05:53:15 But what do you think of the plane itself?
plane-crazy 2020-06-01 05:52:51 Eh
plane-crazy 2020-06-01 05:52:16 The SS were the ones who found people hiding
plane-crazy 2020-06-01 05:52:08 No no no no
plane-crazy 2020-06-01 05:51:59 What do you mean hide the ss?
plane-crazy 2020-06-01 05:51:33 The plane I mean
plane-crazy 2020-06-01 05:51:29 But is it good or bad?
plane-crazy 2020-06-01 05:51:25 They censored second
plane-crazy 2020-06-01 05:49:17 What do you guys think?
plane-crazy 2020-06-01 05:49:11 Eh, I think they understand

plane-crazy 2020-06-01 05:16:21 Thoughts on it?
plane-crazy 2020-06-01 05:16:17 My B17 still has the glitch wherein the center of mass is outside the build zone, but Im hoping rick can help me fix it.
plane-crazy 2020-06-01 05:15:57 The right engine spins clockwise with clockwise propellors, but the left engine spins counter clockwise with counter clockwise propellors. This counteracts the torque that would naturally make it drift right or left
plane-crazy 2020-06-01 05:15:08 Each engine nacelle has 5, 50 speed same rotating motors
plane-crazy 2020-06-01 05:14:56 So I had to use 2 10 density ballast blocks
plane-crazy 2020-06-01 05:14:46 I was suprised to find that it actually wants to pitch up
plane-crazy 2020-06-01 05:14:34 949 Block count, no helium
plane-crazy 2020-06-01 05:14:27 https://gyazo.com/96414f1a9ba738b946f9e403f42bc024
plane-crazy 2020-06-01 05:13:52 https://gyazo.com/bc377dc36b8a146f4ca3729ad5f6a000
plane-crazy 2020-06-01 05:13:09 They were also placed a lot farther back
plane-crazy 2020-06-01 05:12:59 Unlike most bomb bays, the B-18A (And B34 as well as a few others) Had a 2 stage door system
plane-crazy 2020-06-01 05:12:38 And the bomb bay is a custom, different kind of 2 door
plane-crazy 2020-06-01 05:11:12 The dorsal and belly gunners work
plane-crazy 2020-06-01 05:11:08 https://gyazo.com/5ed59538e105d8922de970a9c6bbad23
plane-crazy 2020-06-01 05:11:04 Im really happy with how it turned out
plane-crazy 2020-06-01 05:09:44 No hidden propellors, just stacked motors and a dual custom prop setup
plane-crazy 2020-06-01 05:09:30 Completely prop driven.

plane-crazy 2020-06-01 05:09:18 I finished by B-18A "Bolo"
plane-crazy 2020-06-01 02:41:46 I do ww2 stuff.
plane-crazy 2020-06-01 02:41:40 I dont do jets though
plane-crazy 2020-06-01 02:41:35 Maybe.

plane-crazy 2020-06-01 02:38:18 I even designed a bomb bay for it that works like the real one
plane-crazy 2020-06-01 02:37:17 Such a tall boye
plane-crazy 2020-06-01 02:37:12 
plane-crazy 2020-06-01 02:37:06 Im in love with the B18
plane-crazy 2020-06-01 02:34:57 Thats a sin.
plane-crazy 2020-06-01 02:09:31 Im just confused as to who did it
plane-crazy 2020-06-01 02:09:26 I did
plane-crazy 2020-06-01 02:06:40 Eltorks SCPF may have been the culprit
plane-crazy 2020-06-01 02:06:25 Who tf has 20k members to dislike a group?
plane-crazy 2020-06-01 02:01:47 Theres a mega problem with plane crazy

plane-crazy 2020-05-31 04:20:51 Im gonna try to
plane-crazy 2020-05-31 04:20:41 I know
plane-crazy 2020-05-31 04:17:20 I had to record that before getting into a war thunder match
plane-crazy 2020-05-31 04:16:22 Im playing war thunder
plane-crazy 2020-05-31 04:16:18 Alright give me a minute
plane-crazy 2020-05-31 04:16:01 I did that
