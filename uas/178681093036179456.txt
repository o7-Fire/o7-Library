creations-chat 2020-12-14 17:51:03 I‚Äôm not sure how they work in plane crazy but in real life it‚Äôs basically a fixed bar of steel at one end connected to the suspension arm with a wheel on a tank. It uses torsion (twisting) to create more resistance as you push it upwards, which means it is an effective, simple, and cheap form of suspension
creations-chat 2020-12-14 17:53:11 Big brian
creations-chat 2020-12-14 17:56:41 It‚Äôs welded to the hull at one end and poking through a hole on the other end just enough for it to be attached to a suspension arm on a tank
creations-chat 2020-12-14 17:59:08 Exactly, which is why I‚Äôm not sure how they work. Maybe using low torque motors?
creations-chat 2021-04-18 01:51:25 Did you overlay that or is there an in game thing I don‚Äôt know of
creations-chat 2021-04-18 20:16:00 All of my hulls havent tapered towards the bottom, they have been straight walls from the deck to the keel

creations-chat 2021-04-23 19:58:42 water isnt wet or dry, it exists in a state between the two.

the definition of dry is "free from moisture or liquid; not wet or moist."
the definition of wet is "covered or saturated with water or another liquid."

water cannot cover itself or be saturated in itself, thats like saying a hunk of milled aluminum is saturated with aluminum.

by the layman's definition of wet, the object had to be originally dry or partially dry.
if you jump in the pool and are completely submerged, are you wet or dry? neither. it is only until you exit the pool that you are wet.

Scuffed Zumwalt AGS

Short barrel, experimental, horrible motor locking, too big, but its a start.

Hate the zumwalt, but I love its weapon system.

The part where I keep misalligning the barrel on purpose is to show that the strength of the trapdoors can seat the barrel properly even if misalligned

creations-chat 2021-04-30 05:18:27 The creation is the system itself. The system is done. The half blocks simply show that you can use it in a compact fuselage

creations-chat 2021-05-02 07:00:02 Gonna send an updated 262 I made tmrw, replaced the R4M fireworks with actual rockets for improved pvp capabilities and moved a single firework to the chin of the plane, similar to where Werfergranate-21s would be placed

For now can I get feedback on my current one? Thanks.

creations-chat 2021-05-02 15:52:11 Np, keep the sparkler tho. Just try to match its color to the wood as best as you can so it looks like a pivot pin

creations-chat 2021-05-17 07:40:18 I built most of the hull of a 4 tracked tank thing with the hull gun of a Maus and 4 anti aircraft guns. I wanted to add a three barreled gun with an auto loader

What else should I add? Pics tmrw

creations-chat 2021-05-17 19:31:25 gonna give it a 3 barreled turret with an autoloader. anything else I should add? each leg can rotate but there is suspension in the hull to prevent it from rotating too much, and each road wheel on each leg is also suspended independently
