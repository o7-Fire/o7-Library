creations-chat 2020-08-03 04:27:36 The motor lock was implemented to well, lock the motor in place so it wouldn‚Äôt move or glitch out when it wasn‚Äôt intended to, the whole glitch wasn‚Äôt intentional or at least i don‚Äôt think so, as far as i remember people found it useful and it was never actually fixed.
creations-chat 2020-08-03 04:28:46 I don‚Äôt get people who find a way to dislike motor lock other than people who find it annoying when they‚Äôre actually trying to keep the motor locked and not more half a block

creations-chat 2020-08-13 14:17:06 The only problem with the decals is that, a lot of people want it but as someone said there's no moderation *In-game*, there's only Rick and Mad that have the power to Ban from plane crazy
creations-chat 2020-08-13 14:17:32 Yeah but i haven't seen him in years.

creations-chat 2020-08-13 14:18:06 <:ElonSad:573361014112780303>
creations-chat 2020-08-13 14:20:19 The thing is there's not much you can do until some moderation is implemented,  which if i'm not mistaken is being worked on.
You actually should keep evidence somewhere stored of people breaking the rules so when the Moderation becomes a reality, they can be punished.
creations-chat 2020-08-13 14:21:20 I heard somewhere recently it was slowly becoming a reality.
creations-chat 2020-08-13 14:22:24 Well damn, it's taken so long.
Ever since i was an Admin i had asked for in-game moderation, and literally **everyone** agreed it was a good idea with some minor restrictions that is.
creations-chat 2020-08-13 14:22:51 I thought Mad was the one against it, not rick.
creations-chat 2020-08-13 14:24:41 I actually agree with the idea of Image panels
