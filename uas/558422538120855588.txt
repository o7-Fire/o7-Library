help 2021-10-28 03:09:59 is there any way to paint the middle of these so the white lines are gone?
help 2021-10-28 03:38:12 yeah but when i go to place the next block one side isnt colored so it apears part colored and part white like the darker red in the midle
help 2021-10-28 03:39:00 having two paint blocks next to eachother allows you to color one of the two blocks sides that are touching but you cant color both
help 2021-10-28 03:42:25 ah oki thx
help 2021-10-28 03:43:47 what stuff i had in the pic was a magma cube im making and i am just making the thing mostly out of normal blocks and on corners im using the paint blocks so ill keep that in mind when i do the bottom and top

creations-chat 2021-12-06 00:48:04 <@!673670368757678106> what am i even looking at (the stalker thing)
creations-chat 2021-12-06 00:50:20 or a video at least so we can look around

and if i get 20 upvotes on my EoC post ill make king slime WITH the ninja inside.. or maybe a calamity mod boss
creations-chat 2021-12-06 00:52:47 ah okay then.. but maybe go all sides or at least more than the front... also what is the stalker thing.. is it a location in some game or movie?
creations-chat 2021-12-06 01:03:02 lmaoo
creations-chat 2021-12-06 02:32:09 dont you just hate when that happens > : (

creations-chat 2021-12-06 19:20:14 le 3d Golem from Terraria... as of right now its about 40% finished
creations-chat 2021-12-06 19:26:15 yes, maybe put the boat in water xd i dont think its a plane
creations-chat 2021-12-06 19:34:25 probobly finish coloring the front but design wise my words hold no weight as ive never built a boat like these myself so i dont really have any feedback design wise but the greys over the red could use touching up
creations-chat 2021-12-06 20:19:47 id like to see you do better then.. if i dont then can it
creations-chat 2021-12-06 20:22:37 i dont exactly have infinite room so i cant do better.. golem is fucking massive for a 1-1 scale to look like that
creations-chat 2021-12-06 20:27:02 ok and? im not the best at this damn game? thats litterally like comparing a teens strength to a full adults and expecting them to match up... like give me a break ffs
help 2021-12-07 04:24:55 Am I allowed to ping a moderator to do my ticket for pixel artist? It's been up for almost 2 days now and my designer rank II only took a few hours (over night)
help 2021-12-15 10:18:06 imo you could balance it out to make it look better.. as in make it like 1.5x longer and make the main cannon bigger by like 2x

help 2022-08-01 23:46:11 ngl im most exited for the new map instead of the game itself

help 2022-08-01 23:47:23 oh yes THIS we need the 82 variants of wedges for any situation
help 2022-08-01 23:48:15 could you make like a short clip of it turning?
help 2022-08-01 23:48:40 like a 10 second one or like 5 is coo
help 2022-08-01 23:49:11 its been in dev for a while tho so you can expect it at least
help 2022-08-01 23:53:19 you got that vid?
help 2022-08-01 23:56:46 i got an easy solution
help 2022-08-01 23:56:51 dont use mouse controls
help 2022-08-01 23:57:23 its bad for sharp turning but its better for cosmetic flying or just REALLY fast planes that you dont want to try and controll
help 2022-08-01 23:57:57 id say make the two front controll pannels your E and Q to tilt then the other 4 for W and S to turn
help 2022-08-01 23:58:08 you'd be flying like they do planes irl
help 2022-08-01 23:58:14 tilt then pull up
help 2022-08-01 23:59:37 ig
help 2022-08-01 23:59:49 i personally like q and e more tho
help 2022-08-01 23:59:56 but its different for everyone
