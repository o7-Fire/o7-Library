creations-chat 2022-04-27 18:03:57 <@456226577798135808> the art of making seaplane is to having the engine as far away from water, so I suggest it would be better to have the engine above the wing just like how 1930s flying boat having that feature

creations-chat 2022-10-28 01:22:01 Make the wingtip more flat, it's too pointy
creations-chat 2022-10-28 01:28:53 It appears you're using 1x1 delta wings, try using 1x2 or 1x3 to make the leading edge less steep and makes your plane less triangle
creations-chat 2022-10-28 01:32:23 They should, try deleting the trailing edge by one block, I'd say the tails need a rework too
creations-chat 2022-10-28 01:34:38 True, use the experience from building that to make a new one
creations-chat 2022-10-28 01:39:05 Not bad for first plane, just need more practice

Just don't share it to creations yet, lot of amateurs quit because of the rude feedback
