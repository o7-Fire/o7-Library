creations-chat 2022-12-26 19:14:56 isn't every ro-size car the same length and width? and also on such a scale there is no possibility to make some part of the car in different variations due to the small number of blocks for building in a small size
creations-chat 2022-12-26 19:17:33 btw I am the dodge owner
creations-chat 2022-12-26 19:22:45 here are some differences:
1) no ugly smoke
2) polished
3) propeller wheels are inverted
4) the radiator grille is deeper than mine
5) your car has 0 mm clearance
