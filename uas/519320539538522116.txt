The Tale of 5gm (519320539538522116)
creations-chat 2020-11-03 20:08:10 I recommend you don't post motor lock builds in creations until after either rick fixes it or roblox fixes the data problem
creations-chat 2020-11-03 20:23:50 probably less leaving than you expect, motor locking is actually pretty rare on servers at least in my experience with non pvp servers. However those that do leave are going to be skilled players
creations-chat 2020-11-03 23:59:55 Thoughts on this a4 skyhawk? What can I do to improve it?
creations-chat 2020-11-04 00:01:37 well I was gonna motor lock the cockpit on to my head and the intakes inside the build, so I guess I will have to wait until after the no motor lock is fixed to add those. Is intakes too far out or too far back?
creations-chat 2020-11-04 00:04:17 Also how do I prevent the half blocks in the fuselage from welding to the motors and preventing them from locking? When I was motorlocking a 1x2 wedge onto the seat for the cockpit any halfblock near the motor stack prevented it from locking properly
creations-chat 2020-11-04 00:13:07 Does this version look any better? I made the cockpit less s t u b and slightly lengthened the intakes. Intakes won't be able to get any longer or cockpit any shorter until motor lock is back
creations-chat 2020-11-04 00:14:45 Top down as requested
creations-chat 2020-11-04 00:16:17 Do you think I should make the elevator at the tail a bit wider?
creations-chat 2020-11-04 00:23:03 added some wedge 1x4s near the end of the tail
creations-chat 2020-11-04 00:26:24 hmm, should I go for IAF, Argentina, or US marines
creations-chat 2020-11-04 00:27:58 AV22 sounds kinda dope ngl
creations-chat 2020-11-04 00:52:31 took down my a4 skyhawk since something rascist got more upvotes than it ðŸ˜¦
creations-chat 2020-11-04 00:54:25 if that is the actual plane crazy build im very impressed
creations-chat 2020-11-04 00:57:01 the skyhawk didn't get any upvotes, this https://discordapp.com/channels/384021699466756103/384025409945337856/773347893943730176 did

creations-chat 2020-11-04 17:40:42 Thoughts on how I can improve my Douglas A-4 Skyhawk?
creations-chat 2020-11-04 17:43:21 is there any way to make custom angled wings?
creations-chat 2020-11-04 17:45:13 I can barely even see the build so I'd say yes
creations-chat 2020-11-04 18:04:59 Thoughts on what I should change to improve this?
creations-chat 2020-11-04 18:07:12 front wings or back wings specifically?
creations-chat 2020-11-04 18:08:54 The front wings are curved, but the back wings are sharp
creations-chat 2020-11-04 18:15:57 that was me
creations-chat 2020-11-04 18:17:38 why is the door ajar?
creations-chat 2020-11-04 18:19:09 the windows themselves aren't that bad, they just bulge in the middle and have rims that are too thick
creations-chat 2020-11-04 18:24:51 do the rear elevators look better now?
creations-chat 2020-11-04 18:30:50 what part specifically about them? more curve? less curve?

creations-chat 2020-11-04 19:05:46 it made sexual references, which I would consider NSFW
creations-chat 2020-11-04 19:55:33 are you trolling?
creations-chat 2020-11-04 19:58:14 no I was referring to the fact you called it a plane when the build war clearly a car, not saying you weren't allowed to like it
creations-chat 2020-11-04 20:08:39 I want it to have the ability to fly
creations-chat 2020-11-04 21:24:58 wait did they lengthen slowmode?
creations-chat 2020-11-04 22:39:21 what happened that resulted in the slowmode getting so high in the first place?
creations-chat 2020-11-04 22:58:23 thoughts on my a4 skyhawk?
creations-chat 2020-11-04 22:59:54 too small in the y axis?
creations-chat 2020-11-04 23:01:25 yeah, do you mean I should make them thick wings with half blocks?
creations-chat 2020-11-04 23:03:26 can you show me a picture? I think that would be easier for me to understand, like a picture of a real life wing or something
creations-chat 2020-11-04 23:05:25 better like this?

help 2020-11-05 17:26:42 nvm spent half an hour messing around with motor lock and got something that worked
creations-chat 2020-11-05 17:58:08 <@!626449107577471012> I think it could use some more motor lock on the nose
creations-chat 2020-11-05 18:01:22 <@!482716420409393163> is that tutorial or original?
creations-chat 2020-11-05 18:02:53 It isn't horrible, but it could definitely use some better wings and rudders with no holes in them
creations-chat 2020-11-05 18:04:33 I'd say it is about the same as my first attempt to make a jet
creations-chat 2020-11-05 18:06:44 I generally try to be nice and I'm just going to give him the benefit of the doubt and say that is his first plane
creations-chat 2020-11-05 18:08:15 I mean the majority of creations have negative upvotes, some of them deserve it others less so
creations-chat 2020-11-05 18:11:16 I mean they were straight up told not to post WIP in creations so what did you expect
creations-chat 2020-11-05 18:18:00 <@!719112686612512819> I would recommend using motor lock on the intakes so they aren't so C H O N K. Cockpit looks a little bit off, and it looks like your rudder is floating above the engines which could be fixed with motor lock.
creations-chat 2020-11-05 18:19:31 criticism is fine but constructive criticism is much better
creations-chat 2020-11-05 18:22:47 finish the plane before you post it
creations-chat 2020-11-05 18:24:48 motor locking wing panels on to a black block or wedge is generally the best way to go about it <@!719112686612512819>
creations-chat 2020-11-05 18:36:06 either this is an alternate universe or what he added to it apparently made it worse
creations-chat 2020-11-05 19:27:23 I ain't seeing the harrier there
creations-chat 2020-11-05 19:29:43 <@!508594652115501056> I'd recommend you watch some tutorials so you know how people build planes in plane crazy and learn about motor lock before you come back so you only get 10 downvotes instead of 30 on your next post
creations-chat 2020-11-05 19:31:16 harrier only has a single rudder. that thing has 2
creations-chat 2020-11-05 19:33:08 Oh, I thought it was the really bad f35 that currently has 31 downvotes was the plane he made
creations-chat 2020-11-05 19:34:39 that's actually a pretty solid harrier <@!508594652115501056>, it is just horrible as an f35
creations-chat 2020-11-05 19:45:25 is there a difference?
creations-chat 2020-11-05 20:21:21 what does it mean to be ranked?
creations-chat 2020-11-05 20:59:41 the dude in the plot next to the guy making the aircraft catapult is making enough missiles to wipe out all lfie on earth
creations-chat 2020-11-05 21:05:20 oh thats what it was, I couldn't even tell what it was meant to be. Well now I'm on my way to downvote it.
creations-chat 2020-11-05 22:36:57 there seems to be a lot of minecraft stuff in plane crazy lately
creations-chat 2020-11-06 14:10:06 wait does flapping wings generate lift in plane crazy?
creations-chat 2020-11-06 14:11:44 so you would need a really tiny fuselage and big wings? Along with some system to keep it stable
creations-chat 2020-11-06 14:30:44 7/10 could use more derp
creations-chat 2020-11-06 14:33:14 make a tounge sticking out with drool :p'

creations-chat 2020-11-06 16:34:21 Feedback on my a4m skyhawk? Suggestions for fixing the weird nose especially appreciated
creations-chat 2020-11-06 17:02:21 assuming it actually flies he had to actually balance it, which would have taken more than 15 minutes
creations-chat 2020-11-06 17:07:49 surprised he hasn't left yet
creations-chat 2020-11-06 17:10:51 <@!690608020723597384> I recommend you delete your post in <#384025409945337856> so you stop getting bullied in <#504436696021204992>

creations-chat 2020-11-06 17:15:48 <@!690608020723597384> you can look in the wedges section of the building menu to round out the front and back of your build
creations-chat 2020-11-06 17:17:26 ok can we chill now? We have said everything that needed saying
creations-chat 2020-11-06 17:20:05 Hey at least it wasn't a self upvote. Also it isn't the worst thing I've ever seen in <#384025409945337856> because it doesn't depict a controversial subject. (DISCLAIMER: AT THE TIME THIS MESSAGE WAS TYPED HE WAS NOT SELF-UPVOTING)
creations-chat 2020-11-06 17:22:41 I mean asking why people disliked is sensible because it helps them improve their build if they know what they did wrong.
creations-chat 2020-11-06 17:25:39 man got seal clubbed for 20 minutes, o o f
creations-chat 2020-11-06 17:27:41 did they up the slowmode?
creations-chat 2020-11-06 17:29:23 I doubt slow mode is getting lowered after what just happened

creations-chat 2020-11-06 20:42:38 <@!576471078373687317> your ship looks ok until half way down and than it just gets f u n k y
creations-chat 2020-11-06 20:47:40 expect any build that has shredders on it to receive a l l the downvotes
creations-chat 2020-11-06 20:50:14 I have a hard time with noses, what is the best way to figure them out?
creations-chat 2020-11-06 20:52:09 Wait, where are the canards if you plan to do a naval flanker?
creations-chat 2020-11-08 20:19:58 <@!332062994702008321> PLEASE MAKE THOSE WINGS SMOOTH, your plane would look good if it didn't look like the plane got shot in the wings repeatedly
creations-chat 2020-11-08 21:40:28 why are so many people flexing ranks, the tags under your name only say whether you have built good builds, not whether the current one you are posting is good
creations-chat 2020-11-08 23:48:57 because toxic people love destroying anyone whose builds aren't their idea of perfect
creations-chat 2020-11-09 00:09:51 directed at the people using it unironically
creations-chat 2020-11-09 00:16:15 I'm referring to the grey zone builds, some are objectively bad like that b2 bomber
creations-chat 2020-11-09 00:32:08 <@!577655331229007872> that's a phantom right? You chose a REALLY bad angle for that camera shot, I suggest you zoom out a bit
creations-chat 2020-11-09 00:33:53 Idk about a4 skyraider by a4 skyHAWK is DEFINITELY not what he posted

creations-chat 2020-11-09 02:13:44 submarines generally only have 1 set of hydroplanes and they are smaller than that. Remove the rear hydroplanes, shrink the front one, and work on the cone in the back
creations-chat 2020-11-09 02:31:19 I like how painting it like a pencil got instant upvotes. Kinda creative paint job tbf
creations-chat 2020-11-09 02:35:10 what does wmv stand for? Also I would HIGHLY discourage downloading random files
creations-chat 2020-11-09 03:32:22 Constructive and detailed feedback on my mini ye8?
creations-chat 2020-11-09 03:34:09 Here is a front shot. Any specific areas that need more detail? Also being small was one of the goals
creations-chat 2020-11-09 03:35:58 What would an example of more details be? More half blocks and wedges on the fuselage?
creations-chat 2020-11-09 03:40:32 Plan was to paint over the engines, I didn't really have a better plan. Might widen it up with some half blocks tommorow. Other option is figure out how to motor lock rockets and put them all in the last rear bit
creations-chat 2020-11-09 17:04:50 his isn't that bad, it just needs some work on the strock, handle, and color scheme

creations-chat 2020-11-09 22:03:54 eh I'd say it takes some
creations-chat 2020-11-09 22:53:15 is it very low effort hour here?
creations-chat 2020-11-09 22:55:40 "Please refrain from posting reference images," also it was more directed at the one below your post because at least you weren't begging for likes

creations-chat 2020-11-09 23:19:41 <@!530887980814958613>  plane is great but WHERE ARE THE ENGINES
creations-chat 2020-11-09 23:21:49 The colors of the wheels are much less relevant than the absences of engines, you made it sound like you forgot the engines existed
creations-chat 2020-11-10 15:29:55 the problem is pvp favors smaller builds

creations-chat 2020-11-10 16:45:16 can we get an F in the chat for the dude who got like 3 upvotes on the titanic
creations-chat 2020-11-10 23:31:09 I think it helps with the mission of this channel to provide detailed feedback, also it prevents people from spamming stuff like SELF UPVOTER or BRICK or YOUR BUILD IS TRASH. I prefer the slowmode because of how toxic this channel is even with it, it would sometimes get unreadable without it
creations-chat 2020-11-11 00:02:05 valid feedback matters a whole lot more than their actual skill level
creations-chat 2020-11-12 01:08:48 should I try an su-17? I'm looking to do some sort of attack-focused aircraft with lots of guided bombs and maybe a missle or too
creations-chat 2020-11-12 01:14:11 is the su34 the only supersonic aircraft with a toilet? Idk if stuff like the b1 lancer or tu22 has a toilet, but I know the su34 does
creations-chat 2020-11-12 16:39:59 why does a modified tutorial plane have so many upvotes
creations-chat 2020-11-12 16:45:50 electro that would be cool, it would be decorative only since plane crazy doesn't allow refueling, I imagine some plane crazy groups would really enjoy it though
creations-chat 2020-11-12 17:50:19 wat is wrong with dat harrier
creations-chat 2020-11-12 22:35:05 <#384025409945337856> is an odd place... WIP builds with motorlock sticking out and meme builds get more upvotes than quite a few decently well made builds
creations-chat 2020-11-12 22:48:27 he doesn't make any political judgments about whether the flag is good or not, I wouldn't consider it political. Even if he did it would be more racist than political.
creations-chat 2020-11-13 03:30:30 probably that, could also be the fact it sometimes feels like upvotes and downvotes are randomly generated

creations-chat 2020-11-17 01:25:27 why does that parachute mess have almost the same amount of upvotes as the mech group photo? One clearly has a significant amount of effort put into it
creations-chat 2020-11-17 01:27:58 Because he wants to receive feedback in <#504436696021204992> , do you see a problem with this channel being used for intended purpose?
creations-chat 2020-11-17 02:32:15 coward didn't even post the build mode version
creations-chat 2020-11-17 15:18:20 people with reasonable standards maybe?
creations-chat 2020-11-17 15:22:52 <@456226577798135808> it helps A LOT to get other people's opinion to improve
creations-chat 2020-11-17 15:24:23 <@!548845256234369034> depends how bad your are, if you are like me even people who don't have special pixels next to their name can help me improve my build
creations-chat 2020-11-17 15:27:57 lolman you realize the dude who built that car qualifies for designer 4, by your own criteria he is considered good enough to help me.Also if trees says it is decent, it is probably pretty good
creations-chat 2020-11-17 15:38:10 But your criticism should be constructive and reasonably detailed
creations-chat 2020-11-17 15:42:12 <@!693249246157340713> The build is pretty amazing, however I would recommend trying to round the intakes a bit, it is hard at that scale but if you can find a way you should absolutely take it
creations-chat 2020-11-17 18:08:41 also probably took 5 or 10 minutes to make that CWIS, so we got 3 quick builds in a row
creations-chat 2020-11-17 18:53:22 <@456226577798135808> what game is that
creations-chat 2020-11-17 20:29:32 is no one gonna talk about the dude making a computer only getting 11 upvotes
creations-chat 2020-11-17 23:42:25 seeing inthetrees call someone toxic was kinda ironic <:KEKW:670310537300672528>
creations-chat 2020-11-17 23:55:42 either give it b o m b or make it a flying aircraft carrier if you are feeling spicy (idk if germans had those but they are cool)
help 2020-11-18 14:45:18 Ruddering in the opposite direction of the spin might also help
creations-chat 2020-11-18 19:21:36 he left
creations-chat 2020-11-18 19:23:24 he gonna get hunted now, *we're coming for you*
creations-chat 2020-11-18 21:37:17 He's new he probably doesn't know self upvotes aren't looked kindly upon. <@!612017839565439030> I recommend you remove your own upvote or people are going to downvote you regardless of your build quality because they don't like self upvotes. Also tutorials don't count
creations-chat 2020-11-18 21:39:25 I mean you posted a tutorial so it is probably too late already...
creations-chat 2020-11-19 00:41:26 is he gone yet or does someone need to ping an admin
creations-chat 2020-11-19 00:44:03 that is a poorly worded phrase that I am surprised roblox didn't censor
creations-chat 2020-11-19 18:56:56 <@!621961120617594880> At first I thought that was an f-14 tomcat
creations-chat 2020-11-20 18:44:58 what
creations-chat 2020-11-20 19:24:00 anyone know how to make flares?
creations-chat 2020-11-20 22:07:30 why do you even care if he self upvotes? not like its going to get him a rank or hof, and even if it did a self upvote isnt counted for those
creations-chat 2020-11-20 22:28:28 I have never self upvoted, also your argument that supporting something against the rules is fraud is false because it isn't against the rules, just looked down upon by the community

creations-chat 2020-11-23 17:38:50 gonna try to make the a6 intruder, the intakes are going to be an absolute pain though
creations-chat 2020-11-23 23:59:22 that looks good, what carrier is it based off of
creations-chat 2020-11-24 00:06:13 <@!335599526414909451> what carrier is that carrier based off of
creations-chat 2020-11-24 03:11:48 <@!652626249272918026> how did you do the angled intakes? I want to know so I can angle the intakes on my a6 intruder
creations-chat 2020-11-24 03:22:59 the f117 is just not a pretty aircraft so that was probably part of the problem, the a6 im gonna start on after I figure out how to do angled motor lock probably isn't going to be pretty either

creations-chat 2020-11-25 18:02:36 There's so much motor lock you can tell it was built for the PCC

help 2021-09-14 01:50:33 How do I balance out my helicopter? I built a prototype that mechanically functions like an actual helicopter (swashplate slightly tilts the blades to create movement in the desired direction) but it pitches up when the blades are spinning and *hard* down when they aren't.
