creations-chat 2021-03-21 20:16:08 Just shut up and stop arguing over a children's game
creations-chat 2021-03-21 20:18:12 I STARTED THE ARGUMENT AND IM ENDING IT
creations-chat 2021-03-21 20:22:40 just shut up about the argument its over and done with. It couldve been avoided if you just said something like "the design dosent look too good but it could use some help! I hope you get better at building!" obc litrally said "move on ty"
creations-chat 2021-03-21 20:28:09 nothing dont worry about it its all over and we are all calm and we can be friends now
creations-chat 2021-03-21 20:40:17 are yall just downvoting my spaceship because of the argument?
creations-chat 2021-03-21 20:42:51 did you even read the description? obviously not. PURPOSELY CARTOONY AND UNFINISHED LOOKING.
creations-chat 2021-03-21 20:45:02 did you even read the description? i doubt any of you read it.
creations-chat 2021-03-21 20:48:03 im a beginner lol and its my first build on pc. @shadedwood your mom jokes are dead.
creations-chat 2021-03-21 20:50:24 i didnt say anything about why my build was getting downvoted. jeez maybe give a little design advice or something instead of downvoting and saying "LOLOL THAT SUCKS"
creations-chat 2021-03-21 20:52:51 can everyone just stop being so rude and actually be nice? WAIT. KINDNESS DOSENT EXIST ON DISCORD NEVERMIND IM JUST GOING TO INSULT EVERY LITTLE MESSUP EVERYONE MAKES LIKE EVERYONE ELSE DOES!
creations-chat 2021-03-21 20:55:58 yeah im pretty sure if i had a rank people would be saying "oh try fixing this" and "oh try fixing that".
creations-chat 2021-03-21 20:59:24 im trying to be polite. your not being very polite though.
creations-chat 2021-03-21 21:01:26 its good for a mini creation. could use a LIIITLE help though. Try camoflauge or maybe a mix of red and black, or white and blue. Things like that can really help a design!
help 2021-03-21 21:07:42 Is this good landing gear for my Handley Page O400 (google it dum dum) If i put the wheels one block further it looks ugly so i think i might go with this.
help 2021-03-21 21:10:01 ok ill try to make it smaller because i realized if the landing gear would be like that it would have to be HUGE (like 5x bigger than the actual aircraft)
help 2021-03-21 21:10:26 yeah
help 2021-03-21 21:12:13 i think this is the design im going to go with. Its 2x smaller and seems accurately sized.
help 2021-03-21 21:13:50 i cant find any good images for the cockpit so im just going to take a wild guess at how it looks
help 2021-03-21 21:15:28 oh thanks
help 2021-03-21 21:15:43 i think that will do
help 2021-03-21 21:21:29 due to plane crazy's limitations i think this will have to be the cockpit. it looks kinda bulky and cartoony but i think im going to have to use this.
help 2021-03-21 21:34:31 oof i cant get the gear right so i think ill just pick another aircraft to make <:empty:794431705070174238>
help 2021-03-21 21:40:39 im gonna make the Gotha G.iv because i think the landing gear look a lot easier to make with plane crazy's limits.
creations-chat 2021-03-21 21:49:04 <#497142796961054721> smells like cheeze

creations-chat 2021-03-21 22:28:06 why is that jet downvoted i dont see anything wrong with it really
creations-chat 2021-03-21 23:30:35 yeah and i remember when each indivisual block had outlines so you could tell if there was a beam or single block

creations-chat 2021-03-22 00:35:38 the tailfins are actually sized correctly, the tailfins on the Gotha were very small. Im trying to add curves right now as well. I think i made the tailfins a little too short front ways though
creations-chat 2021-03-22 00:39:01 oh dang.
creations-chat 2021-03-22 02:03:03 they look good but a little weird compared to the high detail of the main parts
