creations-chat 2022-12-01 01:32:38 kid named sidewinder:
creations-chat 2022-12-01 01:52:33 motorlock
creations-chat 2022-12-01 03:01:36 f-35 in modern aerial combat is unironically better, as its still stealth and can carry more missiles, dogfighting doesnt matter that much anymore
creations-chat 2022-12-01 03:05:28 it is that simple, in the age of missiles that can reach over the horizon all that matters is who has the most missiles, who detects the other guy first, and being lucky enough that your countermeasures and evasive manuevers work, jet dogfights almost never happen in modern aerial warfare
creations-chat 2022-12-01 03:12:48 AIM-120D, AIM-260 JATM, R-37M, PL-21, KS-172 for example
creations-chat 2022-12-01 03:18:13 yeah, which is why sweden should make a stealth gripen c to finally produce the best fighter jet ever
creations-chat 2022-12-01 03:20:34 gripen c pretty baller idk, if they made a stealth version of it that had equivalent stealth tech it'd probably be more stealth than the f-35 just due to it's size (even smaller radar cross section)
creations-chat 2022-12-01 03:24:56 i found one guy on the internet that says its already kinda stealth https://www.quora.com/Is-Gripen-E-stealth, idk bro
creations-chat 2022-12-01 03:28:05 a valid source of course
creations-chat 2022-12-01 03:30:30 no i was being ironic inbetween 2 minute chat cooldown while looking for solid info
creations-chat 2022-12-01 03:39:41 ok so i couldnt find shit on the gripen's radar cross section that wasnt from some random dude on the internet, so i will now assume its probably shitty due to only being able to mount weapons on it externally, it seems that the gripen E would be the only variant that could possibly "fight" US aircraft (get a missile off) due to it's supposedly pretty good radar that i cant find any info on within 5 minutes
creations-chat 2022-12-01 03:42:07 yeah if your radar cross section is larger than a golf ball you arent stealth, but the gripen production and maintenance costs are still pretty based and redpilled for what you get, its just shit against stealth aircraft
creations-chat 2022-12-01 03:44:38 no
creations-chat 2022-12-01 03:47:40 depends how big the marble is, theres billiard ball sized marbles
creations-chat 2022-12-01 03:51:42 oh yeah i almost forgot about heat, imagine making your aircraft invisible to radar only to have it get taken out by a cold war era heat seeker
creations-chat 2022-12-01 04:07:00 radar cant pick up infrared, also infrared is light so an enemy jet probably couldnt detect you beyond visual range by infrared, so its probably not that big of a deal in terms of air to air
creations-chat 2022-12-01 04:13:10 it still cant see over the horizon (infrared is light)
creations-chat 2022-12-01 04:20:46 interesting, kinda vague on how it works though
creations-chat 2022-12-01 15:27:50 thats no excuse to copy someone, you should be ashamed

creations-chat 2022-12-02 00:42:37 i am indeed intelligent, thank you
creations-chat 2022-12-02 01:33:08 it has more black on it so its extra stealth
creations-chat 2022-12-03 02:46:48 
creations-chat 2022-12-03 02:49:26 fact, i've improved it alot since then and it looks more drippy, i should repost the new version and see what happens
creations-chat 2022-12-03 03:17:42 i posted the new version of my propfighter and INSTANTLY some dude downvotes it, a bit suspect
creations-chat 2022-12-03 03:23:13 
creations-chat 2022-12-03 03:28:37 you got 90 votes on simple pixel art and 13 dislikes, 94 likes 24 dislikes on a barebones suspension car, then 252 likes 11 dislikes on a plane that is supposedly "built for functionality not looks" (it obviously isnt for functionality entirely as you gave it a airframe and various other decorations), then i post an ok looking aircraft with good functionality and it gets INSTANTLY by some dude within half a second then immediately disliked, a tad sussy
creations-chat 2022-12-03 03:32:17 doing a real good job at ignoring the point
creations-chat 2022-12-03 03:34:43 no my bad i did mention those, thought it was the other screenshot chain
creations-chat 2022-12-03 03:41:07 seems as though people in this server simply have high standards for what classifies as an ok build at first, then i see some simple pixel art get 90 upvotes 13 downvotes and a barebones purple suspension car get almost the same amount
creations-chat 2022-12-03 03:44:49 i pointed out something i thought was sussy (some guy downvotes within the half second reactions are available) and you lost it lol, i wasnt complaining about my build being downvoted in the first place
creations-chat 2022-12-03 03:47:16 you said "its just shit" then i pulled out your three builds of less or equal quality (unless you argue about the effort put into the "airframe" on the plane one)
creations-chat 2022-12-03 03:50:41 my plane only looks ok in terms of looks, but it most certainly has more interesting functionality than pixel art and better looks than a barebones purple suspension car
creations-chat 2022-12-03 03:52:57 either i need to post my builds during certain times (different parts of the community are in different timezones thus different standards at certain times) or theres something sussy amiss
creations-chat 2022-12-03 03:55:38 look closer, its definetly not the exact same
creations-chat 2022-12-03 03:58:54 yeah, thus ok cause i had to extend out the prop so i could motorlock propblades into eachother to get 2x thrust for speed (it was a bit too slow), it'd look alot better if i could phase them into the nose of the prop better
creations-chat 2022-12-03 04:01:13 havent seen it flying before, but you should try to hide the wings and control surface wings inside blocks, try to make the control surface gaps as hard to see as possible (in the case of servo control surfaces)
creations-chat 2022-12-03 04:05:02 yeah it looks pretty good, but then you see the control surfaces, to avoid needing wide gaps around the control surfaces you can motorlock them downwards into place, use round ins to unobstruct the front part of the control surface
creations-chat 2022-12-03 04:30:50 rate his build

creations-chat 2022-12-28 03:07:01 the standards are wacky, but this build is just genuinely shit
creations-chat 2022-12-28 03:26:02 poor pic angles and generally eugh, cockpit especially is bad, you can put alot of effort into a build, but just cause you spent 5 hours or 2 weeks building a piece of shit doesnt make it any less of a piece of shit

creations-chat 2023-01-01 07:40:32 it would technically work without it atleast to an extent where a crash isnt guaranteed, computer systems would just compensate for the horrendous constant center of drag and lift shifting and possibly save you from crashing due to a single engine failure, but this plane has too many flaws to ever be practical so it doesnt matter
