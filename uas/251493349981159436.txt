creations-chat 2018-11-10 18:39:51 **i've made a helicopter that does vertical takeoff and landing using only propellors and I don't have the rank**
creations-chat 2018-11-11 03:56:46 is this some literal gyro madness
creations-chat 2018-11-11 03:57:49 I have no idea how to implement this on my heli design
creations-chat 2018-11-11 04:16:17 are you saying it spins uncontrollably?
creations-chat 2018-11-11 04:16:27 <@220562331606843394>
creations-chat 2018-11-11 04:18:20 I might know a way for you to fix this..
creations-chat 2018-11-11 04:21:11 actually, show me a video of it trying to fly
creations-chat 2018-11-11 04:21:17 I want to see what it does
creations-chat 2018-11-11 04:21:22 k
creations-chat 2018-11-11 04:22:45 basically like my prototype heli
creations-chat 2018-11-11 04:22:59 https://streamable.com/397d5
creations-chat 2018-11-11 04:23:10 oops it might of sent in <#384025409945337856>
creations-chat 2018-11-11 04:24:23 yeah I want to try and make a propellor only heli
creations-chat 2018-11-11 04:24:39 no
creations-chat 2018-11-11 04:24:41 no
creations-chat 2018-11-11 04:25:04 the bottom rotor is to control foward and backward movement
creations-chat 2018-11-11 05:00:48 why does that name sound familiar
creations-chat 2018-11-11 05:02:21 **but sounds excesively RUSSIAN**
creations-chat 2018-11-11 05:02:29 yeah
creations-chat 2018-11-11 05:02:40 I knew it was familiar
creations-chat 2018-11-11 05:27:46 oh damn
creations-chat 2018-11-11 05:27:51 nice
creations-chat 2018-11-11 15:04:37 <@220562331606843394> sounds like it needs a gyro, and a torque remover
creations-chat 2018-11-11 15:04:41 
creations-chat 2018-11-11 15:05:12 flame said he knows a way to make some gyro
creations-chat 2018-11-11 15:05:24 I'll need to know what effects it has
creations-chat 2018-11-11 15:05:44 well I gotta do something irl first

creations-chat 2018-11-12 21:14:42 deppends
creations-chat 2018-11-12 21:15:54 fine but it should be <#497142796961054721> because its not in relation with Plane Crazy
creations-chat 2018-11-12 21:16:20 I know, lol
creations-chat 2018-11-12 21:16:38 just saying slowmode is annoying sometimes
creations-chat 2018-11-12 21:17:05 but I understand the use of it rn
creations-chat 2018-11-12 21:17:27 so, üëç for the great use of it
creations-chat 2018-11-12 21:18:14 AI?, but the game doesn't even have proper logic yet
creations-chat 2018-11-12 21:54:25 just don't talk about it unless you want slowmode
creations-chat 2018-12-06 22:42:26 ..

creations-chat 2019-02-05 00:32:29 First attempt at making the body of a helicopter while keeping the entire thing propellor-only.
creations-chat 2019-02-05 00:33:32 Uses also a propellor only tilt system.
creations-chat 2019-02-05 00:34:10 hey the bot did not change my name
creations-chat 2019-02-05 00:36:01 without the lights is kinda boring..
creations-chat 2019-02-05 00:37:27 btw if my discord nickname still shows up as "CreepTheF0x" in this server, please keep in mind my username on roblox has since changed to "5Creep".
bug-reports 2019-02-08 23:08:05 keybinds don't work.
bug-reports 2019-02-08 23:08:25 this is not ok.
bug-reports 2019-02-08 23:30:45 ping me when the bug gets fixed.
bug-reports 2019-02-08 23:30:48 please kthx
bug-reports 2019-02-09 00:30:00 its the keybinds
bug-reports 2019-02-09 00:30:08 all unresponsive to some builds
bug-reports 2019-02-09 18:17:50 is the issue really the guns
bug-reports 2019-02-09 18:23:28 holy crap the guns were the issue
bug-reports 2019-02-09 18:32:16 the pvp guns on your creation seem to break everything
bug-reports 2019-02-09 18:32:39 I removed them all from my heli and it started working again
help 2019-02-09 20:51:07 imagine making a walker that has to swing it's weight foward to move
help 2019-02-09 20:51:27 in a motion that makes it jump
help 2019-02-09 21:10:36 someone did it in Scrap Mechanic
help 2019-02-09 21:10:54 knowing how both games are similar, it should be simple
help 2019-02-09 21:22:53 <@!385247005003218948> removing pvp guns from your creation seems to fix it
bug-reports 2019-02-24 22:50:27 looking at all the stuff with motors ended up giving me an idea
bug-reports 2019-02-24 22:52:00 *if only motors worked like bearings, keybinds making super complicated logic like in scrap mechanic, it would be possible*
help 2019-02-24 22:55:09 *Owned by Arcus_DemoniumAlt*
help 2019-02-24 22:55:18 gonna be sure to avoid him now
creations-chat 2019-02-24 22:57:48 if you take the size of a classic noob (that has no accessories whatsoever and on R6), the height of the noob would be 25cm
creations-chat 2019-02-24 23:00:39 since a classic noob is 5 studs tall
creations-chat 2019-02-24 23:00:58 (1 stud = 5cm)
creations-chat 2019-02-24 23:01:35 (which means a block in plane crazy is 10cm x 10cm x 10cm)
creations-chat 2019-02-24 23:07:40 wait its 2.5 studs?
creations-chat 2019-02-24 23:08:17 the legs of the classic noob is 1 stud thick
creations-chat 2019-02-24 23:08:26 so if there are 2 legs
creations-chat 2019-02-24 23:08:33 it means 2 studs
creations-chat 2019-02-24 23:09:35 hm
creations-chat 2019-02-24 23:09:38 odd
creations-chat 2019-02-24 23:09:45 always thought it was 2 studs
creations-chat 2019-02-24 23:10:47 (which would be true if madattak or rickje changed the character sizes down to 4 studs)
creations-chat 2019-02-24 23:11:14 yeah
help 2019-02-24 23:45:03 anybody can draw
help 2019-02-24 23:45:06 anybody can build
help 2019-02-24 23:45:30 you work hard on building
help 2019-02-24 23:45:36 you also work hard on drawing
help 2019-02-24 23:46:04 copying creations is just not ok
help 2019-02-24 23:46:16 neither is copying art
help 2019-02-24 23:47:25 I can just imagine how bad my 12 year old sister would feel if someone stole the pfp she made for me and say that they made it
help 2019-02-24 23:48:14 trust me I would kick the first person to do that to her off the internet pretty rapidly
help 2019-02-24 23:48:43 now back to the plane crazy part
help 2019-02-24 23:49:14 imagine how bad you would feel is someone blatantly stole your creation and said he made it
help 2019-02-24 23:50:06 its someone copying entirely someone else's build
help 2019-02-24 23:50:20 not if you're skilled
help 2019-02-24 23:50:24 at the game
help 2019-02-24 23:50:32 but not at aesthetics
help 2019-02-24 23:50:46 if you are skilled enough, you can do anything
help 2019-02-24 23:51:23 I do a bit of both
help 2019-02-24 23:51:48 I made this small "hovercraft" that works great for pvp
help 2019-02-24 23:52:22 actually I never tested if they explode in water
help 2019-02-24 23:52:33 thats odd
help 2019-02-24 23:52:40 oof
help 2019-02-24 23:54:46 if plane crazy had the same logic system as scrap mechanic, I would be able to create one of the most complicated systems for a magnet hovercraft ever
help 2019-02-24 23:56:58 yeah motors need to be fixed. period.
help 2019-02-25 00:25:27 whats wrong with motors as a barrel
help 2019-02-25 00:25:59 if you are making something small, then its your only choice
help 2019-02-25 00:26:28 personally it changes nothing
creations-chat 2019-03-04 18:56:56 damn I made someone try out the magnet engine hovercraft concept
creations-chat 2019-03-04 18:57:02 now that's cool
creations-chat 2019-03-04 18:58:49 >specially when you realise its actually the server admin that does it
