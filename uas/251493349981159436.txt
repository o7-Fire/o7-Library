plane-crazy 2019-12-07 02:43:35 meh time to go wash dishes
plane-crazy 2019-12-07 02:42:04 like very very big servers
plane-crazy 2019-12-07 02:41:55 <@!249373398612967441> some servers pay their moderators
plane-crazy 2019-12-07 02:41:25 similar trick used on the WFYB staff application
plane-crazy 2019-12-07 02:40:56 I put that last trick question to stop people from just skimming through the application without caring
plane-crazy 2019-12-07 02:40:00 it's interesting how this is a chatroom for plane crazy stuff however it's used like <#497142796961054721>
plane-crazy 2019-12-07 02:37:48 <@456226577798135808> not as obnoxious (how do you even spell that word)
plane-crazy 2019-12-07 02:37:02 it's also pretty funny to see lilundr act completely different here than in WFYB discord
plane-crazy 2019-12-07 02:35:35 <@!294956031153405952> you got to at least have a little sense of humor if you don't want to sound like a robot lol
plane-crazy 2019-12-07 02:34:53 I didn't even do anything wrong so banning me would be abuse
plane-crazy 2019-12-07 02:34:34 I saw
plane-crazy 2019-12-07 02:34:20 it's hillarious
plane-crazy 2019-12-07 02:34:16 lol when someone asks for help with a mod application here
plane-crazy 2019-10-15 23:00:55 **the economy** needs to be rebuilt
plane-crazy 2019-10-15 23:00:34 but that's currently not the highest priority to fix
plane-crazy 2019-10-15 23:00:09 they should be nerfed, I agree
plane-crazy 2019-10-15 23:00:01 cannon spammers are annoying, I agree
plane-crazy 2019-10-15 22:58:02 I've made an airship that abuses werewolf crate abilities (stabiliser, not the infinite climb thing)
plane-crazy 2019-10-15 22:56:26 yeah, WFYB has a new dev now updates will happen more often
plane-crazy 2019-10-15 22:56:00 just waiting for Devon to fix it completely and get Quenty to push the patch
plane-crazy 2019-10-15 22:55:20 and it's about to get patched
plane-crazy 2019-10-15 22:55:12 WFYB has a werewolf crate crisis
plane-crazy 2019-10-15 22:54:50 because I am busy with WFYB discord and game
plane-crazy 2019-10-15 22:54:41 to fix stuff
plane-crazy 2019-10-15 22:54:36 I only go there when people need me
plane-crazy 2019-10-15 22:53:58 he actually promoted me because I was a friend
plane-crazy 2019-10-15 22:51:29 muted role thing is something that I've had trouble with in the past
plane-crazy 2019-10-15 22:48:55 probably because I do have experience in a server with nearly 2k members
plane-crazy 2019-10-15 22:48:20 I ended up fixing it
plane-crazy 2019-10-15 22:48:13 I wasn't in charge of the perm thing
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 17:36:31 rip xp, my favorite OS
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 17:35:17 why was I legit ghostpinged
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 17:35:35 ok
