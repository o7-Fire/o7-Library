creations-chat 2021-01-07 05:49:45 The double main rotor mostly, also the design just look bad imo
creations-chat 2021-01-07 05:52:12 Try basing it off real helicopters it help, also make it so the rotors are more realistic and have one at the front and a small one at the back instead of 2 at the front
creations-chat 2021-01-07 05:54:56 It's not that hard the design, use the stuff in the half block section it helps and it helps a lot
creations-chat 2021-01-07 05:57:36 That's where ballast blocks and helium blocks comes in, also motorlock too
creations-chat 2021-01-07 06:00:20 It is difficult but manageable. Ur not making it to scale now are you, it wouldn't be very difficult, also use motorlocking too it help
creations-chat 2021-01-07 06:03:44 It don't need to be a perfect ti scale, hell it don't even need to be to scale, to scale stuff is just like a thing you do if you want it that way
creations-chat 2021-01-07 06:05:46 Also you don't need to make it a perfect replica either, just use the real thing as reference and to make the general shape better and what not

creations-chat 2021-01-27 19:16:25 yo that dragon is amazing
creations-chat 2021-01-29 18:29:12 yes, if its gonna look better
creations-chat 2021-01-29 18:44:40 ok
creations-chat 2021-02-03 20:10:28 <@!625224427369660416> the thing is great but like the proportion is off, especially the front part
creations-chat 2021-02-03 20:12:29 like basically the gap should be very thin, but man i like the interior, great job man 🙂
oh ok so about that you can use some folding and motor lock to get the angle right
but tbh i think u got the angle quite right its just a tad too short
creations-chat 2021-02-03 20:14:30 yea like maybe make it like 2 1x4 wedge longer, so like basically 8 blocks longer that should look way better by then

fair enough
creations-chat 2021-02-03 20:16:31 maybe I should start to make an arquitens light cruiser too
creations-chat 2021-02-03 20:18:51 o ok fair enough

creations-chat 2021-02-03 20:22:55 <@!625224427369660416> I think you misspelled Arquitens
