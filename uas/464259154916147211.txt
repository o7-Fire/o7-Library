The Tale of sebvt45 (464259154916147211)
help 2022-03-07 07:42:19 I don’t know how to make mech legs that walk.
creations-chat 2022-03-07 07:48:35 Aren’t there people with good mechanic knowledge?
creations-chat 2022-03-07 07:51:11 Hi?
creations-chat 2022-03-07 07:54:12 Yeah, in mechs
help 2022-03-07 07:59:02 I need help with the mechanisms of mechs
help 2022-03-07 08:00:12 Tutorials aren’t working since my mech is built from scratch
help 2022-03-07 08:07:16 The problem is I don’t know how to make legs that walk
help 2022-03-07 08:07:23 And I have no experience
help 2022-03-07 08:07:26 I’m only a builder
help 2022-03-07 08:08:50 This has taken 3 years because it’s hard to find a way to find someone with experience in this
help 2022-03-07 08:11:34 The joints
help 2022-03-07 08:11:48 I want the walking to be like real walking
help 2022-03-07 08:11:58 Left to right,you know?
help 2022-03-07 08:12:22 If it was just wheels that would make my soul feel I wasted time
help 2022-03-07 08:13:15 I tried looking at tutorials
help 2022-03-07 08:13:22 They are too different
help 2022-03-07 08:13:53 Usually medium sized, thin, and use a sword
help 2022-03-07 08:14:01 But mine is big
help 2022-03-07 08:14:07 Biggest thing I’ve ever built
help 2022-03-07 08:14:53 I even got compliments but I think they were just saying that to make me feel better
help 2022-03-07 08:15:18 But I mean mine looks terrible
help 2022-03-07 08:15:37 I still haven’t finished the feet and the mech itself looks not good enough
help 2022-03-07 08:15:57 There’s all these builds with so many curves and motor locking I’m even wondering if it’s worth trying
help 2022-03-07 08:17:00 Well I barely make progress because I never find experts
help 2022-03-07 08:17:16 I just usually see suspicious looking mechs that are identical
help 2022-03-07 08:17:28 And realize they are half tutorial or full tutorial
help 2022-03-07 08:18:31 It’s already standing upright
help 2022-03-07 08:18:39 Mine has helium and ballast
help 2022-03-07 08:19:05 Maybe I could show you the mech ingame?
help 2022-03-07 08:19:16 It’s too big to post a picture of all the joints
help 2022-03-07 08:19:49 The guide doesn’t work for me
help 2022-03-07 08:20:19 I guess my mech is too different?.
help 2022-03-07 08:21:36 Also it makes it worse that my mech is built from scratch
help 2022-03-07 08:22:04 It’s just a shell with some motors that are unpowered basically a ragdoll since I am trying to figure out how to make it move
help 2022-03-07 08:22:43 It’s been 3 years
help 2022-03-07 08:22:48 Trial and error doesn’t work
help 2022-03-07 08:23:22 I can’t start again
help 2022-03-07 08:24:07 If I made it like those skinny mechs it would lose the resemblance of the thing it’s based off
help 2022-03-07 08:24:11 Which is a toy I own
help 2022-03-07 08:24:44 Instead of using pictures that make my head hurt of trying to implement into the game
help 2022-03-07 08:24:58 I use legos instead
help 2022-03-07 08:25:29 Since the Lego is a physical thing, I get a better view of the build
help 2022-03-07 08:25:41 To then further understand it’s height and width
help 2022-03-07 08:26:22 No no, I made this mech 3 years ago and it’s gotten small improments
help 2022-03-07 08:26:28 Improvements
help 2022-03-07 08:26:38 Like designing the leg more
help 2022-03-07 08:26:41 And thigh
help 2022-03-07 08:26:47 Which was 6 months ago
help 2022-03-07 08:27:21 No they have been there from the start
help 2022-03-07 08:28:19 Can I show you ingame
help 2022-03-07 08:29:15 Wait I have to ask first, do you HAVE experience with mechs?
help 2022-03-07 09:12:03 Does someone have experience with mechs?
help 2022-03-07 09:12:54 Like making legs walk smoothly?
help 2022-03-07 21:40:12 How do I make legs that walk like a human’s?
help 2022-03-07 22:41:17 Yeah
help 2022-03-07 22:50:29 <@!628326581584265216>
help 2022-03-07 22:50:32 Did you check
help 2022-03-07 23:00:30 Caves and cliffs.
help 2022-03-07 23:01:04 (I’m joking)
help 2022-03-08 03:03:12 I spent 3 years on a mech. And it doesn’t even function yet
help 2022-03-08 03:04:14 Also you can redo saving over but you have to not leave the server
help 2022-03-08 03:05:00 No, I just haven’t got the skills to make it walk
creations-chat 2022-03-09 03:40:22 The last time I heard ‘xd’ was 2018
creations-chat 2022-03-09 03:44:36 Do you see how little that narrows it down?

creations-chat 2022-03-10 07:07:00 40/270 chance a human being says good feedback
creations-chat 2022-03-10 07:09:28 It’s not gone, now it’s a chat
help 2022-03-10 07:18:59 How
help 2022-03-10 07:19:22 Not even goku can survive it
help 2022-03-10 23:13:06 Is motor walking worth doing or is thrusters better
help 2022-03-10 23:13:26 I wanna know pvp wise and functionality
help 2022-03-11 08:57:59 Do beams and 1x2 etc blocks reduce lag and are better than using 1x1
help 2022-03-11 08:58:23 I know if you get hit on a beam in pvp it’s gonna take out the whole beam
help 2022-03-11 08:58:49 But my project is already 1900 blocks and if I were to make it all 1x1 I don’t wanna lag the entire thing
help 2022-03-11 08:59:10 It isn’t even done and will be nearly 4k
help 2022-03-11 10:12:22 Is tnt armor banned in pvp
help 2022-03-11 10:12:39 Since I don’t know anything else plus I’ve never used it before
help 2022-03-11 10:12:59 I wanna try being more durable but funny cutter users
help 2022-03-11 10:13:58 They make the blocks die in one hit
help 2022-03-11 10:25:01 Diamond plate?
help 2022-03-11 10:25:05 Or metal?
help 2022-03-11 10:25:14 I thought those don’t affect durability in pvp
help 2022-03-15 05:21:54 Just a question, how tall is the maximum build height in plane crazy
help 2022-03-15 05:22:07 Translated into real life height
help 2022-03-15 05:22:17 Since I wanna know how big my creation is possibly
creations-chat 2022-03-22 10:20:34 I get 80 fps with max graphics and my 2.3k build, except that’s in a vip
creations-chat 2022-03-22 10:24:32 I saw a mobile user saying my build was gonna make his device crash  and it was a vip server with me and him, apparently 2.3k is the max mobile can handle
creations-chat 2022-03-22 10:26:52 Also is reducing beams better than 1x1 blocks since I wanna reduce lag but if a beam gets hit in pvp it takes out the whole thing
creations-chat 2022-03-22 10:29:19 No he got it as a prize from a happy meal
bot-central 2022-03-24 00:45:22 !rank
creations-chat 2022-03-24 02:03:51 But what about a fridge with food?
creations-chat 2022-03-24 02:07:01 So basically people are saying they have tons of dogs?
creations-chat 2022-03-24 02:09:10 Well why would you want someone everyone hates?
creations-chat 2022-03-24 02:11:41 I feel like I just wasted my time confusing myself
creations-chat 2022-03-24 02:13:46 Professional photographer?!?
help 2022-03-24 13:21:52 What’s it mean for designer by the total likes to dislikes?
help 2022-03-24 13:22:12 Does that mean if I had 10 dislikes on a 40 creation it’d be 30 in total
help 2022-03-24 13:22:28 I just wanna know before I mess up a rank request
bot-central 2022-03-24 13:32:35 -user info <@!464259154916147211>
help 2022-03-24 14:06:49 Oh
help 2022-03-24 14:07:22 Huh I guess that system is for people with high dislikes to not be able to get the rank
help 2022-03-24 14:18:02 I’m aware
help 2022-03-24 14:18:10 I haven’t disliked or liked my creation
help 2022-03-24 14:18:25 So in total it’s 47 likes as of righting this
help 2022-03-24 14:18:37 :(
help 2022-03-24 14:19:12 Anyway uh what exactly do I need after I get it to 50 in total
help 2022-03-24 14:19:17 Like photo evidence?
help 2022-03-24 14:19:43 I’ve never done rank questing before I just want a different color name
help 2022-03-24 14:27:00 Well what do I need to get designer rank and robotics
help 2022-03-24 14:28:12 But who do I send it to begin with?
help 2022-03-24 14:29:08 Ohh
help 2022-03-24 14:29:24 What about robotics
help 2022-03-24 14:29:34 Do I need video or photo evidence
help 2022-03-24 14:29:52 It says they may ask me for video so do I have that in case
help 2022-03-24 14:30:33 Also does the mech count as finished despite having no weapons, my main goal was for it to function not pvp
help 2022-03-24 14:30:37 But decided pvp later
help 2022-03-24 14:30:50 A weapon could make it look cooler but I don’t know
help 2022-03-24 14:31:05 So is it finished or not?
help 2022-03-24 14:31:22 Or do I gotta include the pvp
help 2022-03-24 14:31:35 Oh
help 2022-03-24 14:31:46 So not having a weapon yet is okay?
help 2022-03-24 14:32:02 Oh
help 2022-03-24 14:32:27 I guess I’ll do designer then
help 2022-03-24 14:32:59 Oh right
help 2022-03-24 14:33:14 I have the creation already posted
help 2022-03-24 14:34:05 I never said I was gonna do that or that I could
help 2022-03-24 14:34:24 The total votes thing means the 67 votes are reduced based on the dislikes
help 2022-03-24 14:34:41 What?
help 2022-03-24 14:34:53 Wait so that’s not what the total means?
help 2022-03-24 14:35:13 The dislikes doesn’t reduce the likes?
help 2022-03-24 14:35:24 Yeah
help 2022-03-24 14:35:55 I don’t get it?
help 2022-03-24 14:35:58 I know it’s 48
help 2022-03-24 14:36:06 Yes
help 2022-03-24 14:36:16 I haven’t added my vote plus I know it’s 48
help 2022-03-24 14:36:27 That’s why I just said I’m waiting
help 2022-03-24 14:36:59 Also is there a solution to the block height limit
help 2022-03-24 14:37:22 My mech is big enough that it has to be sitting down in building mode
help 2022-03-24 14:37:40 And I realized the sword looks like a dagger because of the block height
help 2022-03-24 14:37:59 Is there some kind of motor locking to solve this
help 2022-03-24 14:38:15 I’ve never used folding on a sword
help 2022-03-24 14:39:25 The mech in building mode is sitting with its arms out since if they were aiming down it would be too short
help 2022-03-24 14:39:31 Also they aren’t aiming upwards
help 2022-03-24 14:40:01 One solution to this problem is I could just make the sword upside down and make the hand just turn right side up
help 2022-03-24 14:40:12 Except it barely gains any more height
help 2022-03-24 14:40:18 And still looks like a dagger
help 2022-03-24 14:40:52 Or maybe I could just do that weird magnet thing people use for swords
help 2022-03-24 14:48:23 Oh
creations-chat 2022-03-24 16:23:46 What can I do to improve my mech? I mean it seems over 20 people think  it's not that good so I think I need to do better
creations-chat 2022-03-24 16:31:07 also here's the back
creations-chat 2022-03-24 16:33:29 I have used signs just not too much also zero emojis/text signs except instructions on keybinds. material is default since wanted helium to blend in more in some places
creations-chat 2022-03-24 16:35:54 materials are known to affect weight, friction, ice is the lightest and would make it as light as a balloon and metal and diamondplate are the heaviest. i tried metal to begin with but realized it was too heavy
creations-chat 2022-03-24 16:38:17 I was thinking of doing the thing where I have 3 shades of blue so it kind of stands out more but tanks in game do that and it looks good, just don't know about mechs like this.
creations-chat 2022-03-24 16:41:22 I've been told the back part of the  bottom legs are in need of detail, the forearms are too but I'm running out of patterns since these are all straight from my mind and rarely from the toy since its too small to have patterns on the limbs
creations-chat 2022-03-24 16:44:02 Also sorry I gotta go I’ll be back later
creations-chat 2022-03-24 18:18:16 I wouldn’t post it in creations if it couldn’t walk
creations-chat 2022-03-24 18:47:33 I realized I forgot to post the back of the mech in creations do I edit my message and put it in or must I start over a new message
creations-chat 2022-03-24 20:35:24 someone said reflective would fit the mech more (I just did paint all to save time) I wanna know if this is worth it or do I do a mix of multiple shades of blue to make it stand out more , also metal is heavy so I'll just make blue parts metal but need more helium.
creations-chat 2022-03-24 20:37:47 this is the original
creations-chat 2022-03-24 20:40:38 I'm trying to find shades of blue that are similar but stick out so you can see details but its hard.
creations-chat 2022-03-24 20:43:37 ohh
creations-chat 2022-03-24 20:45:40 is there some kind of ai or something since I don't know how to make it look good without too random also beams will restrict it sometimes when doing shades of blue <@!614659754249420810>
creations-chat 2022-04-02 05:18:58 Thoughts on improving build?

help 2022-04-14 07:24:38 How did you learn?
help 2022-04-14 07:25:22 Anyway um
help 2022-04-14 07:25:38 I don’t know if it’s good or not since I’m not an expert at motor locking

creations-chat 2022-04-14 22:30:40 feedback ( legs are finished but upper half isnt)
creations-chat 2022-04-14 22:35:11 its a robot, which is why its cube like
help 2022-04-15 09:50:14 Wait what ranks are allowed in the servers
help 2022-04-15 09:51:05 I’m gonna guess rank like mine
bug-reports 2022-04-15 23:37:26 for some reason even when i have no builds on, my maxmium building blocks for 1x1 is stuck at 200
bug-reports 2022-04-15 23:37:35 now my builds load in missing blocks
bug-reports 2022-04-15 23:39:32 nevermind i had to join new server, thank god it didnt erase my work
creations-chat 2022-04-19 07:29:37 How did you get that many cool emojis I’ve never used signs for emojis :(
creations-chat 2022-04-19 07:31:21 Is there a website where you got those kind of emojis since I’ve heard of them but never actually gone there
creations-chat 2022-04-19 07:33:05 Nevermind nobody’s telling me how to get cool emojis/textures
creations-chat 2022-04-19 07:36:08 I'm told to use them on my build but I never did, I really like the diagonal triangle one
creations-chat 2022-04-19 07:37:56 got a recommendation for spots to put?
creations-chat 2022-04-19 07:39:38 i was asking about the emoji/lines (scroll up you can see we are talking about it)
creations-chat 2022-04-19 07:42:51 dude this isn't gispy and I'm not making it look more like it (I already get it called gipsy too much for a robot that isn't gipsy)
creations-chat 2022-04-19 07:44:36 "like gipsy danger and avenger" I didn't say you called it I said I don't want to make it look even more like it
creations-chat 2022-04-19 07:47:24 okay can we go back to what the question even was? it was about what spots would emojis fit on (also the robot gets called gipsy too much for it to be a coincidence so I assumed he thought it was gipsy)
creations-chat 2022-04-19 07:49:16 then why do people keep saying it is, one guy says he's 100% sure its gipsy and the one  guy who knows the source material, named Seyo knows what this robot is based off of and can recognize it and didn't think it was gispy
creations-chat 2022-04-19 07:51:04 also some say its definitely halo (?????)
creations-chat 2022-04-19 07:53:22 guys I'm talking about what spots would emojis fit in (that's why I asked exq for emoji website)
creations-chat 2022-04-19 10:25:34 What emoji symbols website can I trust for using in plane crazy
creations-chat 2022-04-19 15:44:34 half blocks have less room to work with but i dont want to make the chest lose its curve

creations-chat 2022-04-21 13:45:41 No,the joke was it smelled like shit because it’s a toliet, it wasn’t my joke so I don’t know the original intention though. I am just here thinking it flew over your head
creations-chat 2022-04-21 20:27:14 It’s not the color, it’s that it shows they got a achievement for hard work

help 2022-04-24 11:07:02 How do I fold
help 2022-04-24 11:07:17 Or what’s the best way to fold to make the weapon for my robot
help 2022-04-24 11:07:48 Since the block height limit, if I place beams upwards from the hand
help 2022-04-24 11:07:57 I barely get a long beam
help 2022-04-24 11:08:06 It’s more like a dagger
help 2022-04-24 11:08:15 But I want a axe
help 2022-04-24 11:08:52 But if I use a motor to fold, won’t that motor be basically the platform of the weapon?
help 2022-04-24 11:09:04 If it gets hit it breaks the whole thing apart
help 2022-04-24 15:35:09 Definitely
help 2022-04-24 15:35:21 There’s definitely a emoji for those side lines
help 2022-04-24 15:37:01 No but sure you could just use those
help 2022-04-24 15:57:48 Well I’m trying to mainly make an axe
help 2022-04-24 15:58:18 If you want we could enter vip 1 and see how to do this
help 2022-04-24 15:58:42 Also I am now noticing just how blocky the underside of the torso is but I can’t do that right now
help 2022-04-24 15:58:52 So I would rather do the weapons

help 2022-04-25 13:38:49 Oh hey remember me
help 2022-04-25 13:39:12 I was asking about robotics rank
help 2022-04-25 13:39:30 That was our last conversation
help 2022-04-25 13:40:17 I was gonna say I just upgraded the robot
help 2022-04-25 13:40:34 And maybe it’s valid as expert
help 2022-04-25 13:42:01 We were talking about if not having the weapon counted as finished also
help 2022-04-25 13:42:30 I just replied to the message
help 2022-04-25 13:42:36 You can see it goes back
help 2022-04-25 13:42:48 Yeah?
help 2022-04-25 13:43:01 I remember conversations from 8 months ago
help 2022-04-25 13:45:41 Oh right, I was gonna ask
help 2022-04-25 13:45:59 So how do I do a fold that won’t tumble down in pvp
help 2022-04-25 13:46:11 I mean for some boats that use one motor to fold
help 2022-04-25 13:46:24 That breaks and the entire boat chops in half
help 2022-04-25 13:46:45 You mean a lock ish
help 2022-04-25 13:47:05 Also that was an example
help 2022-04-25 13:47:10 I do not have a boat
help 2022-04-25 13:47:19 So I’m asking about a weapon
help 2022-04-25 13:47:23 For the robot
help 2022-04-25 13:47:48 The block height limit makes it so I’m gonna need to fold the sword
help 2022-04-25 13:48:36 But I want to fold it, not unfold?
help 2022-04-25 13:48:38 Uhh
help 2022-04-25 13:48:43 Never mind?
help 2022-04-25 13:50:30 Would a folding guide by YouTube help
help 2022-04-25 13:50:37 Or would camera locking
help 2022-04-25 13:50:44 Oh right, cameras have 1 health
help 2022-04-25 13:50:49 Meaning in pvp they suck
creations-chat 2022-04-26 11:41:31 Everything, because it looks like a tutorial plane but a few blocks added on.
creations-chat 2022-04-26 11:44:28 When I ask about feedback on how to fix my build, it already has progress. That plane needs too much changed that can’t be said here, and if we told you then you’d be relying on us to make it better
creations-chat 2022-04-26 11:47:36 Also uh since I know mainly about building, make the body curved? With wedges and half blocks and others to create patterns. I’m more of a builder not mechanics
events-chat 2022-04-26 12:27:28 What won
events-chat 2022-04-26 12:28:06 Bruh tank
events-chat 2022-04-26 12:28:25 I already see a lot of tanks, why can’t be spaceship or battle bot
events-chat 2022-04-26 12:43:15 Okay maybe not spaceship, that would require I be expert at spaceships
events-chat 2022-04-26 13:34:20 Oh
events-chat 2022-04-26 13:34:49 I mean what was your decision, rkb231
events-chat 2022-04-26 13:35:52 I kinda wanna do space ship or the bot but I then realize who I’m going up against for a spaceship
events-chat 2022-04-26 13:36:13 Which is just many experts
help 2022-04-26 13:40:44 Average number amount of blocks for a mech?
help 2022-04-26 13:40:50 Like a tall one
help 2022-04-26 13:40:56 A huge fucking big
help 2022-04-26 13:41:32 Oh wait someone said 7k
help 2022-04-26 13:41:41 Uh guess that’s better than nothing
help 2022-04-26 14:37:05 No I meant like block count
help 2022-04-26 22:36:39 It’s possible that because the torso is bigger than both the legs combined
help 2022-04-26 22:36:48 That it’s too heavy
help 2022-04-26 22:37:05 Or just not make a thin waist
events-chat 2022-04-26 22:40:02 I see enough tanks but not enough spaceships or uh those bot things

help 2022-05-02 22:10:08 manual walking is bad for battle
help 2022-05-02 22:10:32 since if i lose my legs, how would i move?
help 2022-05-02 22:10:39 thats why a jetpack is needed

help 2022-05-02 23:59:14 What’s the torque do
help 2022-05-02 23:59:43 What’s 1000 do compared to 30( regular)
creations-chat 2022-05-03 06:43:14 I just talked about stuff and that’s how I got to level 3
creations-chat 2022-05-03 07:04:11 Yeah, that’s how I got my designing better (ignore my rank I haven’t gotten to request new one yet), feedback helped me get where I am today.
creations-chat 2022-05-03 07:06:51 Understand this is a building game, it’s like going into a room with many artists. There is practice involved and some stand out more. You can’t get insane talent easily.
creations-chat 2022-05-03 07:09:20 There are people here who see the colors as reasons to be above others, but I would rather see it as achievements one has made, someone with expert is likely more trustworthy and skilled than someone without, which is why some ignore the white names
creations-chat 2022-05-03 07:16:46 It’s literally where you post a creation, get judged. You expect things to always go in favor?
creations-chat 2022-05-03 07:18:29 Also maybe it’s just me but that is a red orange name, not full red
creations-chat 2022-05-03 07:22:40 I’ve only gotten to post one build since I’m still working on the rework of it (you can’t post a wip but at the time I thought the build was done) and I was nervous when I got dislikes but did I go out and rage? no I asked for feedback
creations-chat 2022-05-03 07:26:39 the prize of likes, getting a role color
creations-chat 2022-05-03 07:28:24 "nooooo i dindont  get thae role color!!!!, so sad!!"
creations-chat 2022-05-03 07:32:34 you saw my build in creations? uh sorry if you weren't talking to me
creations-chat 2022-05-03 09:13:17 You still need skill such as learning motor locking and camera locking and others, or styles. If you think it’s so easy why is creations filled with bad builds a lot? Including having a style and imagination, those aren’t things everyone has.
creations-chat 2022-05-03 09:21:07 Well, creations is where you get judged. Just because someone dedicated time or more to a creation doesn’t matter if in the end it doesn’t look good in the current standards. Remember it’s just a color role that is the only reason you would get upset about not having enough likes. A role isn’t worth doing a whole build just to attempt getting it.
creations-chat 2022-05-03 09:25:44 I’m talking about <#384025409945337856> I know this chat is toxic but I’m saying I don’t think it’s okay if someone begs or says they dedicated a lot of time to a build to on purpose try to get likes for a cool role to then later on act above others and continue the cycle.
creations-chat 2022-05-03 09:28:00 Why would he want to achieve what they want, isn’t it his build? 
Also I am speaking  mainly of another guy who left the server just because of getting downvotes which is why I mentioned begging and stuff.
creations-chat 2022-05-03 09:33:02 For role?
creations-chat 2022-05-03 09:38:18 I made a lot of progress in one month, still don’t know if I’m an expert or not but having no ego is better than having one it seems since you either think you’re  so high above the world and get over confidence or can’t ever think of being one of the best and doubt yourself.
creations-chat 2022-05-03 09:41:05 So that is what I think of some peoples mentality, I am unable to know if I truly am good or bad at building, I at least always ask for feedback until there’s no more left to ask.
creations-chat 2022-05-03 19:31:14 the tractor needs some kind of coloring for that huge white part, it feels weird being just white unless that’s part of source material.
creations-chat 2022-05-04 03:15:07 You know it’s bad when you have no friends including roblox friends
creations-chat 2022-05-04 05:48:10 <@375281006091173890> when are you gonna stop doing speech bubbles
creations-chat 2022-05-04 16:05:03 It’s funny until it gets to hall of fame
creations-chat 2022-05-04 16:06:51 Which I don’t get how a orange is funny
creations-chat 2022-05-04 16:09:01 There are times people get 100 likes on a thing you can build without a tutorial, within 3 minutes (meaning you don’t need a tutorial to copy it because it’s so simple)
creations-chat 2022-05-04 16:11:12 You still get a role in designer, though designer expert  has no value anymore so you don’t earn respect which is what many want instead of being called a white name and mocked if they enter a argument.
help 2022-05-04 16:13:36 Of course, if you made something shit in 2020 and forgot to cash in a designer role, you missed out since standards increase and you could’ve gotten expert designer on that build during that time
help 2022-05-04 16:13:55 But now you won’t
help 2022-05-04 16:14:01 Since standards are higher
creations-chat 2022-05-04 16:14:39 Shipwright why? I haven’t made a boat before.
creations-chat 2022-05-04 16:16:25 I already am making a robot so I can try getting robotics expert
Is robotics expert the hardest of those roles?
creations-chat 2022-05-04 16:18:07 Well I’m not good at mechanics so walking is hard to make and currently it’s even more delayed since I gotta update the walking… :( I was so close to finishing
creations-chat 2022-05-04 16:20:30 Also is it good my robot has 4.5k blocks and it’s still hollow… meaning it hasn’t been filled and the limbs are shells except for the motors for joints
creations-chat 2022-05-04 16:22:18 Paint looks good but plane itself is not

creations-chat 2022-05-04 21:34:40 he has a brain??
creations-chat 2022-05-04 23:59:09 If the game became very complex, I would start to lose interest
creations-chat 2022-05-05 00:00:53 Imagine the tutorials, if it had complex building like build a boat… you would need to check every angle, maybe then tutorial builds could be separated by non angled from the pros who build their stuff
creations-chat 2022-05-05 00:03:03 I know, I’m just saying it since it sounds funny having to check every freaking angle then instead of just build your own vehicle/thing instead
creations-chat 2022-05-05 00:41:10 Oh wow other mech builders
creations-chat 2022-05-05 00:44:55 Aren’t those suits, not mechs?
creations-chat 2022-05-05 00:46:48 Also I’ve seen that kind of suit on a tutorial before (not the freddy thing but the mechanics)
creations-chat 2022-05-05 00:48:41 Since the way it works is the exact same except the arms aren’t connected by thick ropes instead it’s motor, also what you mean “jerry”
creations-chat 2022-05-05 00:50:58 Well I meant the first version of jerry with the ropes for arm connection, apparently someone made a tutorial of it somewhere and now people have Jerry’s  in public servers
creations-chat 2022-05-05 00:54:34 Something suspicious is going on, this is what I meant but when I check the date…I had seen the wildfire of this creation in January so is this just another person using it? (Nevermind this was 2021 not last month)

creations-chat 2022-05-10 07:52:02 well it isn't finished so I should probably ask after, would this look good with them anyway?
creations-chat 2022-05-10 07:54:05 Just said it’s unfinished, the new legs aren’t boxy but the torso needs to be fixed. What part needs to be more curved?
creations-chat 2022-05-10 08:59:32 So the current arms are good? (New leg is actually curved but you just can’t see from this angle
creations-chat 2022-05-10 09:05:53 you can see the new leg easier at this angle
creations-chat 2022-05-10 12:42:51 What shape
creations-chat 2022-05-10 12:47:35 Well I grew up with transformers and robots, not gundoms and evangelion
creations-chat 2022-05-10 12:51:31 I do feel the torso needs a rework which is why I curved the legs but they still have the beefy feel in a good way, I’m not planning to look skinny like a evangelion
creations-chat 2022-05-10 12:53:20 The new leg is a perfect in between, that’s my focus for now (the one on the right)
To put it better the edges of the torso will be trimmed and curved more
creations-chat 2022-05-10 12:56:23 It’s actually hollow still since I’m working on adding mechanisms, and it’s also the most detailed out of my friends there are hidden details you can’t see from one angle especially hidden behind the shield

<@588596347272167456> I did mean exterior, practically no interior detail
creations-chat 2022-05-10 13:00:54 If you want, I can show it in game

creations-chat 2022-05-11 11:26:44 That one side already took an extra 4 hours because I broke something but fixed it  so I might need to be extra careful if I do the back as a double axe since a lot of 1x0.9 and motors were needed
creations-chat 2022-05-11 11:34:25 Posting a build you made in under 1 hour without doing any ideas on how to improve it, such as more huge and curved including nice details.

help 2022-05-21 03:27:08 The blocks get tangled together basically

help 2022-05-21 03:27:38 But it’s common for if going over a speed limit, another players build can phase through
help 2022-05-21 03:27:48 Even if it’s 100 speed
help 2022-05-21 03:29:19 No no I’m trying to say I make a 1 block hold

help 2022-05-21 03:29:43 It’s kinda the same as that motor but less risky
help 2022-05-21 03:29:46 My point is
help 2022-05-21 03:30:01 Would it be worth it since at a speed the blocks would start to phase
help 2022-05-21 03:30:15 Since client side stuff
help 2022-05-21 03:30:27 Or does an alt not suffer from wifi delay

creations-chat 2022-05-24 17:38:48 How many blocks to be exact is the build? I don’t know what kind of folding could extend it that much but what’s the block count
creations-chat 2022-05-24 17:41:44 Did that require an alt? It seems to be 4 plots long
creations-chat 2022-05-24 17:43:47 Wait it took no skill?!

creations-chat 2022-05-24 18:01:28 well it is based on a toy but i do want materials and i've thought of doing a light from the eye, do you got any idea what materials and where they would fit?
creations-chat 2022-05-24 18:04:19 i just asked you WHAT materials and where i should add them, i currently only have diamond plate for some tubes
creations-chat 2022-05-24 18:07:35 <@719168864705052802> you got any ideas for materials?
creations-chat 2022-05-24 18:09:40 <@719168864705052802> i dont know what materials to add i dont want it to keep looking like plastic
creations-chat 2022-05-24 18:11:56 thanks for feedback..?

creations-chat 2022-05-24 18:25:06 im aware torso needs fix and hands. but the whole detail thing, it has a ton of detail you just need to see it closer or thats why i need more materials than diamondplate and plastic to see even the tiny details
creations-chat 2022-05-24 18:27:49 wait then hows his standards so high??

creations-chat 2022-05-24 21:11:40 I do agree that the build makes not much sense, what’s with the plow and stuff including why so much rust in some places
creations-chat 2022-05-24 21:13:51 Do you guys think it’ll get in <#627195143040139264> despite it looking random in places (plow etc)



Just because it has 200 votes doesn’t matter, the vips have final say and it’s common for 200+ builds to be denied
creations-chat 2022-05-24 21:17:09 Just because a build is big doesn’t mean it’s hof worthy, creativity and design matter, except a lot of white names think big build equals hof
creations-chat 2022-05-24 21:24:24 But isn’t the staff or people in vip have final voting
creations-chat 2022-05-24 21:31:29 People here determine your skill or if you can be trusted on your ranks, having only expert designer is no value since it’s likely you got it from meme build
creations-chat 2022-05-24 21:34:04 I haven’t upvoted or downvoted a single build ever, 🤔 is that impossible?
creations-chat 2022-05-24 21:37:51 I ask feedback until I can fix as much as I can, that’s why its good to point out flaws and fix them, so then you can make the best you can do either by others opinions or yours

the-dump 2022-07-16 16:22:02 Stole a tutorial and made it his own
the-dump 2022-07-16 16:22:10 Search it up
the-dump 2022-07-16 16:22:27 We need to get him actually genuinely muted or just not get roles ever
the-dump 2022-07-16 16:22:36 Since if he stole two tutorials in a row
the-dump 2022-07-16 16:23:12 He couldn’t figure out how to make the “harder” ones
the-dump 2022-07-16 16:23:49 Or just got too bored of a 30 minute one
the-dump 2022-07-16 16:26:03 I don’t know
the-dump 2022-07-16 16:26:13 It’s off screen like
the-dump 2022-07-16 16:26:19 No boat builds in creations
the-dump 2022-07-16 16:26:25 So only the mod knows
the-dump 2022-07-16 16:27:19 It would be better if I could post images in general since I can’t post his heli to yousuf or in general
the-dump 2022-07-17 15:51:13 Jesse we need to cook some bitches
the-dump 2022-07-17 15:58:18 Combat warrior player:
the-dump 2022-07-20 05:01:24 Build a not a boat for fake treasure
the-dump 2022-07-20 05:04:54 Okay but physics in build a boat bad
the-dump 2022-07-20 05:05:02 Meaning no fun plane fights
the-dump 2022-07-20 05:05:43 The jets aren’t affected by gravity and only move straight
the-dump 2022-07-20 05:06:11 What about pvp
the-dump 2022-07-20 05:06:14 No guns
the-dump 2022-07-20 05:06:47 They break apart in chunks
the-dump 2022-07-20 05:07:25 That’s why the downside of using scaling sucks in build a boat
the-dump 2022-07-20 05:08:08 Or plane crazy to add building
the-dump 2022-07-20 05:08:24 Since build a boat won’t be able to fix its issues soon
the-dump 2022-07-20 05:08:44 The game runs on roblox physics and bugs are created a lot
the-dump 2022-07-20 05:09:22 Oh for a second I thought you said pvp plane fights trash
the-dump 2022-07-20 05:09:30 But yeah gun spam, rocket spam is unfair
the-dump 2022-07-20 05:10:39 I like the idea of 1x1 and a few beams in the menus, or do you mean the tutorial builds
the-dump 2022-07-20 05:11:21 I just don’t want f3x where I have to create a 1x1 block then do that 100 times
the-dump 2022-07-20 05:11:44 Oh yeah weapons you can make is good idea
the-dump 2022-07-20 05:11:57 Bomb.
the-dump 2022-07-20 05:12:31 Someone made wires of the inside of a plane in build a boat
the-dump 2022-07-20 05:12:37 That isn’t meant to be seen
the-dump 2022-07-20 05:12:45 So why build an entire complex
the-dump 2022-07-20 05:12:48 Wire system
the-dump 2022-07-20 05:13:25 Is that a insult or compliment
the-dump 2022-07-20 05:13:33 I never heard of a speech bubble being nice
the-dump 2022-07-20 05:14:19 Oh wait the guy crashed nevermind it’s an insult
the-dump 2022-07-20 05:14:24 He forgot to land
the-dump 2022-07-23 20:54:15 An idiot is someone who’s stupid
the-dump 2022-07-27 06:05:42 It’s only that they are house pets that they are harder to eat
creations-chat 2022-07-27 09:59:52 <@718409831639154718> top gone

the-dump 2022-07-27 10:18:42 Yeah
the-dump 2022-07-27 10:18:47 His only real build
the-dump 2022-07-27 10:19:01 Check the name
the-dump 2022-07-27 10:19:10 He made a YouTube account
the-dump 2022-07-27 10:19:30 He made a YouTube account and posted a build. for something I can copy in one image
the-dump 2022-07-27 10:19:50 I don’t know
the-dump 2022-07-27 10:20:26 Check the image it shows the person  who made it
the-dump 2022-07-27 10:20:28 Which is him
the-dump 2022-07-27 10:20:55 Anyway point of tutorials is to teach or like instructions
the-dump 2022-07-27 10:21:10 Oh
the-dump 2022-07-27 10:21:22 He also actually made the plane and had it in creations
the-dump 2022-07-27 10:21:25 Still does
the-dump 2022-07-27 10:21:28 It’s the exact thing
the-dump 2022-07-27 10:21:53 Not only does Tinon forget
the-dump 2022-07-27 10:21:58 Yousuf forgot
the-dump 2022-07-27 10:22:00 Twice
the-dump 2022-07-27 10:22:26 I actually told yousuf and he said he’d deal with it 6 hours later
the-dump 2022-07-27 10:22:32 But it’s weeks later
the-dump 2022-07-27 10:23:10 Normally this could be overlooked “eh it’d just one bad guy bro”
the-dump 2022-07-27 10:23:14 But he
the-dump 2022-07-27 10:23:16 Actually
the-dump 2022-07-27 10:23:21 I can’t understand
the-dump 2022-07-27 10:24:31 Okay so it sounds like it can be brushed off but
the-dump 2022-07-27 10:24:36 He actively
the-dump 2022-07-27 10:24:41 Makes me question if unde
the-dump 2022-07-27 10:25:41 
the-dump 2022-07-27 10:26:06 ???
the-dump 2022-07-27 10:26:09 Yeah me too
the-dump 2022-07-27 10:26:37 He also says modified tut still fair since he decorated it
the-dump 2022-07-27 10:26:45 Which is why it’s called a modified tut
the-dump 2022-07-27 10:28:17 People panicking because yousuf was off
the-dump 2022-07-27 10:28:21 
the-dump 2022-07-27 10:28:48 He DIDNT
the-dump 2022-07-27 10:28:57 I know
the-dump 2022-07-27 10:29:20 Creations blacklist too?
the-dump 2022-07-27 10:29:41 He doesn’t have any care for using tutorials
the-dump 2022-07-27 10:30:28 Here’s the build he posted
the-dump 2022-07-27 10:30:32 
the-dump 2022-07-27 10:30:51 Also as you can see legit so many active members know this
the-dump 2022-07-27 10:31:02 But yousuf and Tinon do but haven’t done anything
the-dump 2022-07-27 10:32:58 Check what ken has sent in creations
the-dump 2022-07-27 10:33:04 It’s a fucking box
the-dump 2022-07-27 10:33:21 He says he made it work like making a submarine work is hard then decided “that was hard enough I don’t need decoration, surely very impressive of my skills”
the-dump 2022-07-27 10:33:31 BALLAST EXISTS
the-dump 2022-07-27 10:34:33 He didn’t even decorate
the-dump 2022-07-27 10:34:49 I think he’s actually genuinely finding out ballast is a thing
the-dump 2022-07-27 10:35:03 Then posted a box. With ballast. In creations.
the-dump 2022-07-27 10:39:56 <@685909594932773033>
the-dump 2022-07-27 10:40:06 OH HELL NA I FOUND WORST THING HE SAID
the-dump 2022-07-27 10:40:10 
the-dump 2022-07-27 10:41:04 Welcome plane game speedrun
the-dump 2022-07-27 10:41:15 Under 30 seconds and I made box

the-dump 2022-07-27 10:42:01 
the-dump 2022-07-27 10:47:59 I just now realized
the-dump 2022-07-27 10:48:03 I am actually concerned
the-dump 2022-07-27 10:48:08 When the mod saw this
the-dump 2022-07-27 10:48:12 
the-dump 2022-07-27 10:48:22 Did they think it was worthy of robotics III
the-dump 2022-07-27 10:49:05 And it passed
the-dump 2022-07-27 10:53:01 Wtf
the-dump 2022-07-27 10:53:11 So I could get robotics expert this whole time?
the-dump 2022-07-27 10:53:56 I kept improving my robot
the-dump 2022-07-27 10:54:01 So it was worthy
the-dump 2022-07-27 10:54:21 😐
the-dump 2022-07-27 10:55:38 Lie
the-dump 2022-07-27 10:55:52 No way
the-dump 2022-07-27 10:55:56 Mods bro
the-dump 2022-07-27 10:56:17 When I joined I thought it was legit high stakes
the-dump 2022-07-27 10:56:26 More polished means
the-dump 2022-07-27 10:56:31 More better
the-dump 2022-07-27 10:56:46 So master role is the only way to filter bad shit
the-dump 2022-07-27 10:57:40 Is designer rank the only one
the-dump 2022-07-27 10:57:46 That depends on looks
the-dump 2022-07-27 10:58:26 
the-dump 2022-07-27 10:58:39 
the-dump 2022-07-27 10:59:37 Here’s somehow better build than ken’s

the-dump 2022-10-12 12:15:16 Like a cat or tiger
the-dump 2022-10-12 12:26:43 Because mods like black twerking men
the-dump 2022-10-12 12:26:52 Of course it wasn’t banned

bot-central 2022-10-17 01:31:16 <@914605911744593930> he was born just 3 minutes apart wow
creations-chat 2022-10-17 07:28:12 I can’t believe I’d say this but creations chat is more sane than general currently
the-dump 2022-10-18 21:10:51 You should be asking if the ground touches it
the-dump 2022-10-21 21:25:07 Isn’t that backwards?
the-dump 2022-10-21 21:25:29 Folding and locking are meant to make things compact and smaller
creations-chat 2022-10-21 21:29:27 1% of expert ranks:
creations-chat 2022-10-21 21:31:34 Shipwright is the easiest rank you can build a square that floats and has a engine
creations-chat 2022-10-21 21:57:19 You can get expert shipwright with bad boats, I think mods just didn’t care about viewing the builds for shipwright
the-dump 2022-10-22 02:04:40 ok
the-dump 2022-10-22 02:47:53 He said he turned 13 yesterday
the-dump 2022-10-22 02:48:01 Kinda suspicious
the-dump 2022-10-22 02:48:16 Is he having his 13th birthday every yesterday?
the-dump 2022-10-22 02:49:55 <@573970670854340628> how many birthdays does this guy have?!
the-dump 2022-10-22 02:50:14 Bro has 364 birthdays
the-dump 2022-10-22 02:50:59 Then why does he still act like a kid
the-dump 2022-10-22 02:51:12 Wouldn’t his puberty at least kick in
the-dump 2022-10-22 02:52:00 I’m 15 but I’m here originally for posting my build
the-dump 2022-10-22 02:52:07 But since I haven’t been able to finish it
the-dump 2022-10-22 02:52:11 I can’t post it
the-dump 2022-10-22 02:52:24 Also I wanted to see what other people built
the-dump 2022-10-22 02:52:34 And now <#384025409945337856> has taught me that was a bad idea
the-dump 2022-10-22 02:53:05 Is there even a reason to be here
the-dump 2022-10-22 02:53:37 I also wanted help with my build like tips and things
the-dump 2022-10-22 02:53:47 Which didn’t work and I only found 2 people who even would help
the-dump 2022-10-22 02:54:50 Hars isn’t here

the-dump 2022-10-22 02:55:04 But is the server moving in a bad direction

the-dump 2022-10-22 03:09:06 That guy doesn’t even meme
the-dump 2022-10-22 03:12:16 Hey Berry should I actually stay on this server since I don’t have my build finished anytime soon
the-dump 2022-10-22 03:12:21 And
the-dump 2022-10-22 03:12:28 The server isn’t improving really
the-dump 2022-10-22 03:22:54 Would it be okay if I leave then
the-dump 2022-10-22 03:22:59 Until pc2 arrives
the-dump 2022-10-22 03:24:24 Am I an active member
