help 2021-03-23 17:50:03 I am trying to make a giant vtol able to lift other players' vehicles. The problem is that, right here, this big boi has literally 40 giant jet engine and still cannot even lift himself in the sky...does anyone know how to fix this problem?
help 2021-03-23 17:57:54 Only 12 super rockets were needed to lift my thing
help 2021-03-23 17:57:58 I want to swear
help 2021-03-23 18:01:17 OMG MY VTOL ACTUALLY FLIES

the-dump 2021-08-31 16:21:07 I am coming back to this old comment just to tell you that I've took that as a challenge and successfully made one <:trollface:775024642104229898>
the-dump 2021-08-31 16:22:18 Lemme take a pic
the-dump 2021-08-31 16:23:28 There
the-dump 2021-08-31 16:25:44 Oh btw
the-dump 2021-08-31 16:25:58 The mini shredder aren't as useful as the giant one
the-dump 2021-08-31 16:26:11 They're just used when the big one is too damaged to fight
the-dump 2021-08-31 17:26:08 It's a disconnector
the-dump 2021-08-31 17:26:32 Also the blades aren't made for propulsion
the-dump 2021-08-31 17:26:43 They're just made to stabilize the engine
the-dump 2021-08-31 17:26:55 Without it, it would start shaking
