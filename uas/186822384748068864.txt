creations-chat 2019-09-10 15:51:16 Poseidon
Originally from Tradelands, the Poseidon is a slow Ironclad that shouldn't really be used for battle. It's also very expensive.
Features: 2 turrets on the stern and bow,  a protected driver's seat,  an ammo/round-shot box, and a rammer.

help 2020-01-16 21:09:23 just use half blocks or something and then just use the weird carpet material
creations-chat 2020-04-05 13:01:07 you can put an anchor block on the bridge part, cant you?
creations-chat 2020-04-05 13:01:25 so it doesnt tumble when you're driving on it

creations-chat 2022-03-09 21:18:54 well now that its a “chat” slowmode should be removed or reduced to like 10-15 seconds
