creations-chat 2019-06-27 11:50:08 i saw Citizen make quite some good working planes and stuff
creations-chat 2019-06-27 11:50:09 but
creations-chat 2019-06-27 11:50:20 people always downvote it
creations-chat 2019-06-27 11:50:26 just because its white and plain
creations-chat 2019-06-27 11:50:40 and thats the problem
creations-chat 2019-06-27 11:51:34 so
creations-chat 2019-06-27 11:51:36 basically
creations-chat 2019-06-27 11:51:38 a block
creations-chat 2019-06-27 11:51:41 with a couple of collors
creations-chat 2019-06-27 11:52:10 someone could basically place down a collor block and give it nice paint
creations-chat 2019-06-27 11:52:12 and
creations-chat 2019-06-27 11:52:15 you would like it
