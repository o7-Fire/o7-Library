The Tale of _arkangel_ (171455671173251072)
help 2019-01-12 23:23:17 Or if there is something describing how magnets are supposed to work
help 2019-01-12 23:36:15 I wish it was obvious. ðŸ˜›
help 2019-01-12 23:36:48 Add weight to the bottom of the basket?
help 2019-01-12 23:37:21 Suspension block is a solid tip
help 2019-01-12 23:37:49 I haven't seen evidence the "loose blocks" toggle works
help 2019-01-12 23:44:24 Just not getting great results from this magnet latch. One time, I think it may have welded, but not at all in the right spot
help 2019-01-12 23:44:31 
help 2019-01-16 19:26:05 Does anyone know if there is a good document somewhere that says how things like magnets are actually supposed to work?
help 2019-01-16 19:27:19 I've gotten pretty mixed results. So it's been hard to figure out if I'm doing something wrong or...
help 2019-01-16 19:29:15 Also, if there is a change log or dev blog somewhere? I've seen updates from devs saying weld is working "better". I am looking to understand when magnets are supposed to weld, things like that
help 2019-01-16 19:30:15 I have a deck that unfolds, and I want it to weld when it's in position. Sometimes maybe it seems like it does
help 2019-01-16 19:34:55 It has welded unaligned sometimes. There have been times where random blocks became unaligned from those next to them. That's rare.
help 2019-01-16 19:35:58 It's hard to test whether they are welded or but, so sometimes I don't know until it gets bumped. Doing reliable scientific experimentation has been hard
help 2019-01-16 19:36:25 So even if it drops into the exact right position, weld can go wrong?
help 2019-01-16 19:37:57 Yeah. That's been approximately what seems to work. Unfold, activate magnet, then bump the motors a few more times... Then maybe I see a weld ... Or a false positive
help 2019-01-16 19:38:18 Does toggle work better or not?
help 2019-01-16 19:38:40 I use magnets only to get a magnet to magnet link
help 2019-01-16 19:40:57 Has anyone considered putting up a wiki for this stuff?
help 2019-01-16 20:17:49 Hmmm. If I started a wiki, would that be a bad thing?
help 2019-01-16 22:49:01 I did find an amount of wiki:
help 2019-01-16 22:49:02 http://plane-crazy.wikia.com/wiki/Basic_VTOL(hovercraft)_building_guide
help 2019-01-18 18:41:11 I have a question about the culture of getting upset that someone is copying your creation. Especially when there is no copy/paste tool and building anything is extremely manual
help 2019-01-18 18:41:29 If somone copies your creation, they are likely to make a copy error and it's not really the same.
help 2019-01-18 18:42:02 And. 97% at least of anything anyone is making is a copy of something else - either real life or a variation on an existing creation.
help 2019-01-18 18:42:33 Very rarely is anyone making something so unique in plane crazy that it could be called original.
help 2019-01-18 18:42:56 So... where does this idea that copying is upsetting or ban-worthy come from
help 2019-01-18 18:43:07 Does this happen on other roblox games?
help 2019-01-18 19:49:50 IDK. "most builds are a copy"
help 2019-01-18 19:50:08 is basically how music has worked for the last few hundred years
help 2019-01-18 19:51:19 Understanding physics games can have a steep learning curve. 5 people building the same thing helps people get started
help 2019-01-18 19:51:35 Eventually, the designs diverge or evolve.
help 2019-01-18 19:52:43 "too many complaints and too many arguments" - now that makes sense
help 2019-01-18 19:53:42 Even if it's a symptom of many roblox players being much younger - if you make copying a bannable offense, and someone is offended, the argument is much shorter.
help 2019-01-18 19:55:20 Because it's a lot harder to fix the people who are offended over... not so much
bug-reports 2019-01-20 23:07:02 Can I put messages here?
bug-reports 2019-01-20 23:07:10 Yep.
help 2019-01-20 23:07:37 Does anyone know how to reset your spawn location?

bug-reports 2019-01-21 18:49:58 I have a corrupted save. Is it possible... to have it uncorrupted? Is this a bug with a recent update?
bug-reports 2019-01-21 18:51:05 Big Quad Carrier V3.10 has 3366 parts, V3.11 has 3466 parts.
bug-reports 2019-01-21 18:52:06 I finished the 4th rotor between V 3.10 and 3.11
bug-reports 2019-01-21 18:52:57 This is 3.10 - 4th rotor is not attached or complete
bug-reports 2019-01-21 18:54:08 Here's 3.11 from yesterday.
bug-reports 2019-01-21 18:55:01 3.11 test flight did something I've never seen before (this was the result of a magnet glitch)
bug-reports 2019-01-21 18:56:04 Roblox never came back from this position. I clicked on the return arrow to go back to build mode, but my client never responded.
bug-reports 2019-01-21 18:57:45 Another player on the server did see my ship go back to build mode and was able to stand on it, though I still saw blue sky with Speed: inf on my client
bug-reports 2019-01-21 18:58:28 Point of view from MarbleArkMecha's client
bug-reports 2019-01-21 18:59:19 I had to kill roblox since it wasn't responding to pressing esc to get the leave game menu even after a couple of minutes
bug-reports 2019-01-21 18:59:35 When I went into a game and loaded 3.11, I have this:
bug-reports 2019-01-21 19:00:42 Random pieces are missing, even though V3.11 has a block count of 3466, it's clearly not as many as V3.10
bug-reports 2019-01-21 19:01:24 I'm bummed, but I guess it's just 100 blocks.
help 2019-01-21 19:02:34 I'm considering that I should probably put less time into creations if it's not possible to pay to put creations into safe storage.
help 2019-01-21 19:03:00 Either downloading them or publishing them into a catalog (like robocraft) or something.
help 2019-01-21 19:05:17 Bummer.
bug-reports 2019-01-21 19:06:00 The actual block count seems to be 2302 if I save in a different slot.
bug-reports 2019-01-21 19:29:29 Not sure if that's trolling?
bug-reports 2019-01-21 19:30:05 The final screen shot where I load slot 9 and save into slot 10 is over the save limit.
bug-reports 2019-01-21 19:32:02 After that, I erased slot 10 before I exited. In the game where I saved 3.11, I got up to 259.440, so I deleted a creation to get back down to 230 - exited, joined another server, loaded 3.11 with the 4th rotor complete.
bug-reports 2019-01-21 19:33:19 I had a string of glitchy games that night with misplaced build plots and other oddities. But I went into the game where a magnet glitch tore my ship to shreds with all 4 corner rotors complete.
bug-reports 2019-01-21 19:35:18 
bug-reports 2019-01-21 19:38:18 So in the game I was in that caused corruption - I was at 230something save data, came in with 3401 parts, added some, did some keybinding tweaks, saved with 3466 parts and plenty of save data - but I re-used slot 9 and kept the version number at 3.11.
help 2019-01-21 19:40:11 I didn't go over the save limit. To be clear.
help 2019-01-21 19:40:58 There was a session last week where I went over the save limit and what I found was my progress was erased next time I joined a server.
help 2019-01-21 19:42:02 Which made perfect sense to me. There was another session where I went over the limit, delete a creation to get under, saved again, exited the server. Joined another server to check - and all my progress was kept.
help 2019-01-21 19:44:22 Makes sense. There was another session where I saved some updates, was well under the save limit, but didn't realize my laptop charger wasn't plugged in to the wall.  My laptop hibernated without exiting the server. When I turned my laptop back on, the changes from that session were lost.
help 2019-01-21 19:46:06 That sucked, but I can see how the server side script might not be triggered to save to persistent storage if my roblox client stopped communicating without disconnecting.
help 2019-01-21 19:48:43 All that is (for better or worse) understandable. What happened yesterday seems much more like a bug. I came in to a server with 4 rotors on my creation, saved an update, then next time I loaded, the 4 rotor save slot was corrupted with absolutely random blocks missing. Luckily I had a backup in a different slot with just 100 blocks missing.
bug-reports 2019-01-21 19:50:59 I think that just means god is watching your server. Also this god slightly favors yaaru over paulinho132010.
help 2019-01-22 18:43:33 Does anyone know if there is a way to avoid keybinds firing when you're in chat? I've had some unfortunate things happen during flight just typing messages.
help 2019-01-22 18:44:53 Seemed to creep in sometime in the last week. Before that, I could chat without triggering motors/magnets/etc
bug-reports 2019-01-23 00:15:53 <@!328989346411839488>  - You might need to press your Fn key (somewhere between CTRL and ALT) when you press F9
bug-reports 2019-01-23 00:30:20 Huh. I get something like that on my slot that won't load all it's blocks:

help 2019-01-24 18:25:51 Do you have Lock checked on the motors?
help 2019-01-24 18:39:50 It looks like the wings are taking on some pretty intense forces.
help 2019-01-24 18:40:09 And that may just be from hitting the ground
help 2019-01-24 18:40:38 Can you try moving your back landing gears forward so you can pitch up before you run out of runway?
help 2019-01-24 18:41:06 Or taxi onto the area in front of you, turn right and use the longer runway to get speed befor eyou take off?
help 2019-01-24 18:42:27 You could also try putting some rockets on the nose pointed down to force it up.
help 2019-01-24 18:43:03 It's possible your center of lift is a little behind your center of mass
help 2019-01-24 18:43:53 You could put a canard near the nose to add some more forward lift, and control surfaces on the canard to get more control authority for pitch.
help 2019-01-24 18:44:36 I'm not sure that V tail is giving you any control authority for pitch at all
help 2019-01-24 18:45:21 I don't disagree XN, but not hitting the ground would help.
help 2019-01-24 18:46:18 If the V tail control surfaces are set to mouse control (automatic), I'm not sure thier position after moving into V matters.
help 2019-01-24 18:46:32 I get that it's obviously a UAV (extremely not to scale)
help 2019-01-24 18:46:46 But he needs to troubleshoot where his problem is.
help 2019-01-24 18:47:15 OK. Yes, exactly.
help 2019-01-24 18:47:35 Soory, I did not know how much experience NooBaris had
help 2019-01-24 18:47:51 But that plane is clearly pitching down hard when it runs out of runway
help 2019-01-24 18:48:06 vipEmpire - I saw your chat log yesteray
help 2019-01-24 18:48:37 Yes, that was my first suggestion.
help 2019-01-24 18:50:58 Is there a video of the wings glitching that doesn't involve hitting the ground hard first?
bug-reports 2019-01-24 20:36:13 It's not super fun, but you can work around it NooBaris
bug-reports 2019-01-24 20:36:45 1x4 beams mostly work, and you can place one next to it. Then build off it
bug-reports 2019-01-24 22:03:00 Rick - if you want more more shot to fix that loading error, cool.
bug-reports 2019-01-24 22:03:20 But I gotta overwrite that slot soon if it's not going to get fixed. It's nearly half my savedata
bug-reports 2019-01-30 17:17:27 I'm looking forward to the next release. I just confirmed my slot 3 still has the load error

bug-reports 2019-02-02 23:11:11 Is it unfair to ask when an update might come? days? weeks? I do understand it will be done when it's done.
bug-reports 2019-02-02 23:11:33 Is there a dev version to test on?
help 2019-02-04 13:45:48 I've been doing some measurements on rotor thrust output
help 2019-02-04 13:45:53 
help 2019-02-04 13:46:50 Some time ago, I thought I found that I got better thrust from super rocket engines than I did from a motor. But my current observations do not agree.
help 2019-02-04 13:48:03 If the number of blades isn't enough to slow down the motor, motor does get better thrust.
help 2019-02-04 13:49:21 If the drag from the blades is enough to slow the motor, adding thrust from rocket engines will increase thrust some.
help 2019-02-04 13:50:10 (deleted because bad facts. Above is true, though)
help 2019-02-04 13:56:07 When measuring the vertical thrust of rocket engines at full throttle vs pulsed rocket engines, they are identical.
help 2019-02-04 14:12:39 Does anyone know if it's possible to change default roblox keybinds? I would like to use i and o for keybinds, but they zoom the camera in and out
bug-reports 2019-02-04 14:20:05 Would you consider it a bug if the middle engine here produces considerably more thrust:
bug-reports 2019-02-04 14:20:10 
bug-reports 2019-02-04 14:21:20 Am I that dumb? How can you tell the difference?
bug-reports 2019-02-04 14:25:56 Yep. I messed up. That fixed it. Thanks!
help 2019-02-04 14:26:23 My observations above were all wrong. I was comparing rocket engines to super rocket engines. XD
help 2019-02-04 14:52:51 Running two motors (at max torque) produces less thrust than just one. On my scale 1 motor gives me 2.5 thrust. 2 engines both running gives 2.2. Running 1 of the 2 gives  1.35 thrust. Running either motor with "lock" checked also reduces thrust output.
help 2019-02-04 14:53:21 So why do people run propellers with multple motors?
help 2019-02-04 14:54:12 Also, I can tell I've reached maximum RPM with one motor because adding thrust from the rockets does not increase lift. At lower torque, I do get less RPM, and adding thrust from rockets increases thrust.
help 2019-02-04 15:31:18 I have a creation that needs power
help 2019-02-04 15:31:22 
help 2019-02-04 15:31:50 Switching to motor power instead of rockets on the rotors increased my thrust and lifting power by - and this is a rough but conservative estimate:
help 2019-02-04 15:32:15 1 bajillion-fold. The main lift rotor is now putting out enough thrust to lift on it's own
help 2019-02-04 15:33:34 The main lift in the center has a ton of rockets, but they can't touch the power of a single motor mount
help 2019-02-04 15:35:58 At long last, I have defeated gravity
help 2019-02-04 15:36:16 
help 2019-02-04 15:38:42 Oh, have you seen it on a server? To be clear: I am the one who is making it. It's far from made
help 2019-02-04 15:39:03 I've spent a few weeks working through each of the technical challenges
help 2019-02-04 15:39:36 I'm almost there now.
help 2019-02-04 15:40:08 Oh. I'm sorry if I lagged your server figuring things out. I've made it less laggy from time to time.
help 2019-02-04 15:40:23 Figuring out the magnets helped a lot. And getting a more reliable unfolding sequence.
help 2019-02-04 15:40:51 The stability on the rotor-tilt is still a pain.
help 2019-02-04 15:41:09 It's sitting at 3923 right now, I think.
help 2019-02-04 15:41:59 Another 200-400 blocks will get it to full functionality. Then probaly another 800 or so to finish the hull plating and some basic interior.
help 2019-02-04 15:42:08 It's a hover carrier
help 2019-02-04 15:43:06 I started off making a full-size  quad rotor that I could control with my joystick (and joystick gremlin)
help 2019-02-04 15:43:23 And everyone wanted to land on it all the time. And it also had a lifting platform underneath it.
help 2019-02-04 15:43:47 So I revemped it with a more powerful lift motor and added a legit carrier deck.
help 2019-02-04 15:44:26 The quad-rotors need to reach far to the corners for attitude and roll control.
help 2019-02-04 15:45:08 Also - they need to be fairly large? People make big planes so... just had to scale up.
help 2019-02-04 15:48:11 I think I'd like to ask Rick for motors that have adjustable throttle the way jet/rocket engines do. That would make rotorcraft hovering a lot easier.
creations-chat 2019-02-05 13:19:47 Out of curiousity - does anyone think it would be hard to make a hovercarrier? I was thinking maybe like a quad-rotor tilt-rotor hover carrier with an unfolding deck.
creations-chat 2019-02-05 13:25:43 That's the highest speed I've seen that is not just "inf"
creations-chat 2019-02-05 13:30:58 I will admit - I was hoping someone would talk me out of it. But it's too late. :/
creations-chat 2019-02-05 13:31:06

bug-reports 2019-02-05 19:41:47 <@!253999566444167171>  - I was on that same server earlier. I spawned on the black quad carrier spot. It's been there since 7AM this morning.
bug-reports 2019-02-05 19:42:46 I thought it was funny I was coming in to flight test my quad carrier, which can fit the ghost/glitch carrier in it's cargo bay.

creations-chat 2019-02-05 23:49:09 Submitted by @mgmchenry : MGM X-3 VTOL CloudCarrier
Type: VTOL Tilt-Rotor Quad Carrier and Heavy Lift transport
Parts: 4,063 blocks
Speed: Classified
Time to build: 30-50 hours maybe?
Ranks Requested!: VTOL Master, Server Exterminator, Inventor, Floating Fortress

Features: 
- Central lift rotors produce enough thrust alone to put the ship into the sky before unfolding.
- Unfolding landing deck can accommodate very large craft comfortably and VTOLS of any size
- 4 quad rotors with independent control for pitch and roll adjustment, as well as extra lift for cargo
- For maximum control authority, quad rotors extend outward and back when unfolding.
- For yaw control and for level forward thrust, quad rotors tilt to a near-vertical orientation.
- The carrier can hover and flip entirely from vertical to horizontal. (It accidentally went nose up when I was not paying attention once. It had the power to level out from pointing straight up without loosing much altitude. I have not yet attempted a full flip or barrel roll.)
- Magnets safely weld unfolded parts for stability and to reduce lag
- 4 adjustable helium anchor bouys lock the carrier into position for landing approaches (also to reduce lag when smaller craft are landing)
- Loading bay on lower level can be lowered to pick up wheeled or walking vehicles
- Personal purple noob plane on deck for the captain's use
- There is an aircraft elevator for small/medium craft to move from deck down to second level

I should probably make a youtube about it? I love how people love to land on it, whether I'm ready or not.
creations-chat 2019-02-05 23:49:49 Re-submitted to clarify ranks requested
creations-chat 2019-02-05 23:52:44 Rank creds:
VTOL: Yep. It goes up. It goes down. It flies around.
Server Exterminator: 4000+ blocks. If I don't have magnets engaged to lock down loose parts, no anchors engaged, and someone tries to land on the deck - gravity and time nearly stop for any pilots on deck.
Floating Fortress: I have had 4 planes on the deck. I've also had planes land in the lower cargo bay. I'm not thrilled when planes land *ON* the quad rotors. I did build grills above them to protect them. "Entire flight deck must be above water in order to qualify." - technically, yes! It's well above the water! I can take a picutre of it floating if I have to...
Inventor: The port and starboard sides each have a linked pair of quad rotors. Each pair of side rotors is always *parallel* (edit: not perpendicular). Left side pair can go forward while right side goes back or stays level. There is a suspension+rope return-to-center mechanism with adjustable tension (tighten the ropes) to lock the rotors into level position for hovering. (or to overcome the stress when some yahoo lands on the actual rotor! XD ) That took some trial and error and several scrapped ideas to get right.

bug-reports 2019-02-07 05:57:18 OK.
bug-reports 2019-02-07 14:25:01 XD
bug-reports 2019-02-08 03:05:32 Oof. Looks like this update killed my CloudCarrier. Before snow update, I got 60FPS before spawning my carrier, then 25-40 after I launch. Occasional dips to 10fps while I unfold and latch the magnets.
bug-reports 2019-02-08 03:07:24 Now, it's just...  death. 20FPS before even launching while still in build mode. 0.5 to 5FPS where I used to be getting 25 to 40 only 24 hours ago.
bug-reports 2019-02-08 03:12:20 Liftoff at 2FPS is painful
bug-reports 2019-02-08 03:12:43 Also, when I spawn it, everyone on the server gets zero FPS for several seconds.
bug-reports 2019-02-08 03:13:04 So... CloudCarrier is on hiatus until there is a lag fix release
bug-reports 2019-02-08 03:21:01 Does Moore's Law still work? I'll be back in 2025 when computers are fast enough for this...
bug-reports 2019-02-08 03:21:04 
bug-reports 2019-02-08 18:38:40 That's a relief. I went poking through the microprofiler to get some clues why things were so much slower for me.
bug-reports 2019-02-08 18:40:14 On a PC where GPU was def not an issue with a higher clock speed than my main, no surprise - better FPS, still one CPU core pegged for Roblox.
bug-reports 2019-02-08 18:40:23 All the time spent in physics
bug-reports 2019-02-08 18:48:10 doWorldStep, newStepContacts, and stepContacts taking up most of that.
bug-reports 2019-02-08 18:49:16 With a high enough CPU clock, I can still get enough FPS to fly my lag carrier, but I won't load it into public servers - when I launch it locks up other clients sometimes for a few seconds.
bug-reports 2019-02-08 18:49:30 Looking forward to the fix!
bug-reports 2019-02-08 18:59:03 Sure did! I'm comparing right now.
bug-reports 2019-02-08 19:04:27 Opposite here: The plane on the deck of my carrier has has it's automatic roll control broken since the last build. Mouse didn't roll any more. Now, it's suddenly fixed.
bug-reports 2019-02-08 19:04:39 Build before last broke it, sorry
bug-reports 2019-02-08 19:29:01 Lost control - but physics surprisingly dead:
First load - control was good. FPS OK
got distracted for a minute before physics started glitching
... returned to build mode
Second load - Can't control anything with keybinds
- microprofiler shows physics system not doing anything at all
bug-reports 2019-02-08 19:29:07 I'm seeing if I can recreate it

bug-reports 2019-02-10 18:24:28 I posted a video yesterday of jumping out of craft, motors going berserk.
bug-reports 2019-02-10 18:26:03 It's legit. I took a minute to level my carrier, then get out to talk to someone on deck. Then my motors went so fast, they broke the magnet welds that hold them steady

bug-reports 2019-02-10 18:28:20 Those 4 motors are on 4 different keybinds, and I def wasn't pressing them when I jumped out.
bug-reports 2019-02-10 18:30:02 Actually, in that run, I had already exited my main pilot seat, noticed the deck was crooked - then say down in the control tower pilot seat, leveled out and anchored the deck
bug-reports 2019-02-10 18:30:56 Upon jumping out of the non-main seat: that's when it went crazy.

So maybe it's from getting in and out, or maybe just the non-main seat

bug-reports 2019-02-14 13:26:10 For both of you, Roblox is using about 50% of four logical processors.
bug-reports 2019-02-14 13:26:59 One of you is seeing that thread activity spread out a little
bug-reports 2019-02-14 13:28:37 Some Intel processors (I think common with I5) have two hyper-threaded cores, which is almost like having 4 CPUs, but not
bug-reports 2019-02-14 13:29:54 Some Intel processors can run at a higher clock rate by temporarily turning off hyperthreading
bug-reports 2019-02-14 13:31:28 So for anything that has a single thread maxing out a CPU, the processor decides it can run faster by boosting clock speed and running fewer concurrent threads
bug-reports 2019-02-14 13:31:45 In other words, it's complicated
bug-reports 2019-02-14 13:32:53 And I'm pretty sure Roblox physics engine isn't set up to take advantage of multiple cores - not more than 2, anyway
bug-reports 2019-02-14 13:46:11 It depends. With Roblox, you def get more out of boosted clock speed than turning on more CPUs.

bug-reports 2019-02-20 17:57:03 Possible workaround for "Roblox physics" ragdoll insanity: maybe keep track of the players "sane" position every .1 seconds or something. As long as the speed and acceleration of the playermodel is sane, keep updating it. Something like

sanePosition = playerCharacter.HumanoidRootPart.CFrame

Then once acceleration or speed becomes insane and they are not in a vehicle seat, do something like
playermodel:SetPrimaryPartCFrame(sanePosition)
And then kill all the players velocity.

This would protect against parachute glitches, players flinging off of parts unexpectedly, and trolls griefing the server with flinging machines.

The only issue then would be if the place you were .1 seconds ago is now inside something else and you get stuck inside a block.
bug-reports 2019-02-20 17:59:02 I think the benefits would outweigh the inconvenience of being thrown into outer space unless you're in a creation going for the lightspeed rank
bug-reports 2019-02-20 19:49:48 Here's a magnet fix request/suggestion: a   only, weld, and align all checked and the magnets are about to weld, see if you can set the position of the location with lower mass aligned with section of the part with higher mass, with the magnets squared up face to face.

Maybe put a BallSocketConstraint between them with limits enabled or a spring constraint with free length set to zero, then disable any other constraints between the two for a moment while it settles into aligned position before welding.
bug-reports 2019-02-20 19:54:01 Roblox physics workaround again - the "bug" is when after unfolding a creation and I toggle the weld magnets on, it can glitch warp out of the known universe. I've learned to decrease the chances of that by a lot, but there is still a good chance it will weld into a glitchy position that only gets worse when I unweld. Especially if the magnets are intersecting a little bit. Then I have to despawn and start over.

Once everything is welded, things go pretty well, though!
bug-reports 2019-02-23 20:01:31 Spring length setting is not quite right.
bug-reports 2019-02-23 20:04:48 Spring lengths are 3(minimum value), 5, 7.5, 10, and 15

bug-reports 2019-02-25 01:49:13 Huh. Nevermind. Since the last update, I can load something else, load the big one back, spawn, and keybinds work again.

bug-reports 2019-02-25 02:49:52 Right click for block picker when you're in the build tool would be even better
bug-reports 2019-02-25 03:33:40 Right click could do both

bug-reports 2019-03-01 18:53:19 I was able to glitch out of the spot with some work, but the ghost acted like it was anchored in that spot - which is what it would do if the other creation was in build mode, come to think of it.

bug-reports 2019-03-01 18:55:17 You can use this time to investigate locking down folds with magnets. Or latches.
