**Comment:** This was originally a prototype ship to test water physics using motor-driven paddles and wing rudders. Pleased with the results of the speed and handling, I went on to fashion this into a pirate ship. Eventually by accident and against it's original intents, it could waddle on relatively flat land! So it could conquer sea and land... but what about the air? That's when I decided to slap on a massive balloon and it flew... badly. It can fly, just not steer very well.
creations-chat 2019-01-21 20:53:53 **Continued**
Nonetheless, it has been my largest and most adaptive build I have ever done. Unfortunately the time has come to throw anchor on it. With the physics engine throttling to 12% on large builds and being outcompeted by more advanced builds and the short save space means I cannot work on it any longer.

help 2019-02-12 00:25:36 I'm not expert but I believe attaching tnt to some magnets inside a barrel might do the trick. I suggest 1x0.9 blocks for the barrels if you don't want the projectile to stick!

*The Matilda is a heavy cruiser designed by me. It sports 2 main calibre Mk IV turrets and one auxiliary Mk I turret capable of dishing out tremendous firepower with good accuracy. The powerhouse of this cruiser remains classified but can give a great top speed of 96 on full  speed astern.*
creations-chat 2019-02-13 12:27:15 I called it a heavy cruiser cos of the large turrets

Build name: Python Turboprop
Part count: 145 (Including test rig)

Comment: Behold! The Armstrong Siddeley Python turboprop engine that features contra-rotating propellers!
In game, there are no need for extra motors to counter the 1st set of motors speed for the second set! It has been tuned to be relatively stable from physical shocks. The test rig carries 8 ballast beams set to 40 due to the sheer acceleration it dishes out.

creations-chat 2019-10-26 21:30:07 Anyway, I expected people to be salty with my new engine so I'll take it a step further
creations-chat 2019-10-26 21:31:36 I'll be square - people don't like a lot of my creations.
creations-chat 2019-10-26 21:31:57 And that includes my airship hybrid which is +3500 blocks
creations-chat 2019-10-26 21:33:08 He said that cockpits are easier to design than swashplates
creations-chat 2019-10-26 21:35:20 Before my final design, I used pistons
creations-chat 2019-10-26 21:35:27 Oh my god were they stupidly weak
creations-chat 2019-10-26 21:35:45 So I switched over to using motor2s and levers

creations-chat 2019-10-26 21:44:32 So I have a different method of swashplate?
creations-chat 2019-10-26 21:45:04 Well it works, but there's this annoying gyroscopic effect that restricts movement

creations-chat 2019-10-27 08:04:51 No
creations-chat 2019-10-27 08:05:03 The truth is that people set their expectations *way too high*
creations-chat 2019-10-27 08:05:46 That's the community's opinion
creations-chat 2019-10-27 08:05:56 Which can easily be biased at any time of day
creations-chat 2019-10-27 08:06:31 Although if you think it's "basic", at least give some construction criticism instead of leaving creators in the dark
creations-chat 2019-10-27 08:08:44 Some ships can be like that, usually interceptors or blockade runners
creations-chat 2019-10-27 08:12:38 Instead of wedges, maybe use half-blocks?
creations-chat 2019-10-27 08:13:19 I can relate - I intend to make most of my builds simple
creations-chat 2019-10-27 08:13:51 But at the end of the day, I just have to keep experimenting

creations-chat 2020-04-29 17:31:42 Racing Jet Aircraft, Blizzard Mark III
Top speed: 602 (642 w/ T-Booster, 694 at 90' Dive)
Block count: 78
Max fuel consumption rate: 13/s (Capacity: 2700)
Design inspired by the book *Hover Car Racer* and the game *Jet Ion GP*. 

The mark I had large rear wings and used regular control surfaces. Unimpressed by the unnecessary drag caused by the rear wings, The mark II introduced an overhaul to the control system and wing design, with elevation trimming and movable horizontal stabilisers, achieving 500 speed.
Mark III was introduced to resolve the loss of control at speeds greater than 450. Better stability increased max speed to excess of 600.
*(There was an experimental mark IV featuring stylised wings. Flight performance concludes that it had an negative impact of top speed and roll rate. Turn rate however, improved marginally.)*
