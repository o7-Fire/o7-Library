plane-crazy 2020-07-24 07:59:51 People complaining how laggy their vehicles are while I'm sitting here trying to optimise my 100-block jet because physics is a fool
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 21:02:33 But that's coming from the guy who kept searching for aerodynamics of a cow
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 21:01:49 If only roblox wasn't so resource intensive, then we could have every single block have aerodynamics depending where they are placed
plane-crazy 2020-07-15 21:38:42 Doesn't seem to be a delta wing?
plane-crazy 2020-07-15 21:31:46 But the problem is that doing so will lead to the terrain being unrecognisable
plane-crazy 2020-07-15 21:31:20 I'm tempted to delete terrain textures too
plane-crazy 2020-07-15 21:31:02 Deleting textures makes the game run marginally faster
plane-crazy 2020-07-15 21:30:46 I've probably deleted the universe aside the earth
plane-crazy 2020-07-15 21:30:26 I just found a weird side effect for deleting textures in roblox files
plane-crazy 2020-06-24 09:50:35 Roblox doesn't deserve my money
plane-crazy 2020-06-24 09:50:18 But I can't do that via robux otherwise I'd also be giving money to roblox as well
plane-crazy 2020-06-24 09:49:58 I understand that game devs need money
plane-crazy 2020-06-05 13:08:09 Which is 1225 walkspeed
plane-crazy 2020-06-05 13:08:03 We've already went through about what's roblox's speed equivalent to the speed of sound irl
plane-crazy 2020-06-02 12:55:45 Center it with a space before it
plane-crazy 2020-05-30 14:22:05 He literally means 100 bombs, but no specification in mass
plane-crazy 2020-05-28 17:26:41 I'd say functionally, it's good
plane-crazy 2020-05-28 17:25:18 A question?
plane-crazy 2020-05-28 17:07:14 For me, it's small, optimised and functional
plane-crazy 2020-05-28 17:07:00 It depends your definition of nice
plane-crazy 2020-05-28 16:37:24 Like you have to go through waypoints
plane-crazy 2020-05-28 16:36:56 I wish there will be an aircraft "racetrack" on the new map *if* it's being developed
plane-crazy 2020-05-28 12:15:01 Imagine wanting to build something sizable but as soon as you build something larger than 120 blocks, the physics speed slowdown kicks in
plane-crazy 2020-05-28 12:11:15 Not only the fabric made it lighter, but it made it extremely prone to the slightest bit of general lag
plane-crazy 2020-05-28 12:10:17 But what's interesting is that I tried to give my biplane a fabric skin and the physics went haywire
plane-crazy 2020-05-28 12:08:11 And I never had an issue with sleeping parts once
plane-crazy 2020-05-28 12:07:35 Even it struck me as odd because even when I jumped on the blocks just to be sure, they all appeared similar
plane-crazy 2020-05-28 12:06:44 Problem is that this image was made months ago and I don't have the save anymore
plane-crazy 2020-05-28 12:05:49 I'm definitely sure
plane-crazy 2020-05-28 12:05:37 All of the parts moved when I spawned them in
plane-crazy 2020-05-28 12:05:28 That's not the case
plane-crazy 2020-05-28 12:04:13 Yeah fabric makes normal blocks weightless apparently
plane-crazy 2020-05-28 12:03:47 
plane-crazy 2020-05-28 12:03:24 Let me check here
plane-crazy 2020-05-28 12:02:39 "Fabric material has no weight"
plane-crazy 2020-05-28 10:48:14 Ballast blocks are basically almost weightless at their minimal spec
plane-crazy 2020-05-26 16:53:29 Not using conveyor drives because it's really laggy when they're not being used
plane-crazy 2020-05-26 16:53:06 Should I use a magnet drive instead of a hover drive because it's underpowered?
plane-crazy 2020-05-26 10:24:40 How does a hover drive work?
plane-crazy 2020-05-26 10:19:44 How does a hover drive work?
plane-crazy 2020-05-25 20:44:52 In theory for Plane Crazy, the speed of sound ingame is 1225 walkspeed
plane-crazy 2020-05-25 20:22:55 Aye
plane-crazy 2020-05-25 20:22:52 So 16 walkspeed is 4.48 m/s but must find the value of 1 walkspeed
plane-crazy 2020-05-25 20:21:24 It's 343 m/s according to google
plane-crazy 2020-05-25 20:21:15 Eh I've rusted
plane-crazy 2020-05-25 20:20:42 *I think
plane-crazy 2020-05-25 20:20:40 The speed of sound irl is 20566 m/s
plane-crazy 2020-05-25 20:18:18 To put that into roblox universe, guess I divide 1234 by 4.48
plane-crazy 2020-05-25 20:17:56 So the speed of sound is 1234 irl
plane-crazy 2020-05-25 20:16:50 In comparison, a jog/near running pace is 12 kph
plane-crazy 2020-05-25 20:15:25 How about treat 5 studs as 1m
plane-crazy 2020-05-25 05:28:33 ...so I've made a working breech and barrel although I had to use a piston to correct the height offset by the rocket launcher so it lines up with the barrel. That's fine on paper.. Reality though is that the piston never stays in position and locked mode causes the piston head to freeze and not want to follow the bottom part
plane-crazy 2020-05-24 19:04:10 /e breakphysics
plane-crazy 2020-05-21 10:37:08 This guy is racist
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 22:41:01 Because it's so easy to disable outlines
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 22:40:42 I'm putting a grudge against them
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 22:40:37 If anyone says that they're glad that outlines is gone
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 19:51:52 What makes siren head relevant
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 19:51:15 Ikr
plane-crazy 2020-05-18 15:54:13 Like a crane
plane-crazy 2020-05-18 15:54:10 That roblox's physics allows parts from one's building to be localised to another building
plane-crazy 2020-05-18 15:53:30 I wish
plane-crazy 2020-05-18 13:24:22 *Roblox: The game with the worst physics engine?*
plane-crazy 2020-05-18 13:23:56 I can already see this in the headlines
plane-crazy 2020-05-18 08:40:15 Owned by you
plane-crazy 2020-05-18 08:40:08 It is your plot
plane-crazy 2020-05-18 08:39:28 What am I looking at the gif?
plane-crazy 2020-05-18 08:36:50 Which is concerning
plane-crazy 2020-05-18 08:36:45 I'm seeing *a lot* of people saying *What's new update* despite the game already telling them that it's bug fixes
plane-crazy 2020-05-18 08:24:45 I noticed that my plot wasn't registering me as the owner
plane-crazy 2020-05-18 08:24:29 <:KEKW:670310537300672528>
plane-crazy 2020-05-18 08:22:07 Which ironically is a fix
plane-crazy 2020-05-18 08:21:45 There goes my save data
plane-crazy 2020-05-18 08:21:39 Bruh update
plane-crazy 2020-05-18 07:58:29 It sounds like the wind from Natural Disaster Survival except heavily edited
plane-crazy 2020-05-18 07:57:47 I just realised something about the sounds the rocket engines make
plane-crazy 2020-05-18 07:40:39 Anyway I doubt they'd add bombshells
plane-crazy 2020-05-18 07:39:49 Most bombs use TNT or Amatol
plane-crazy 2020-05-18 07:39:03 Explosive blocks are bombs?
plane-crazy 2020-05-17 19:35:14 Cos it seem to detect mouse movement when it goes out of the window
plane-crazy 2020-05-17 19:35:02 Are you in fullscreen?
plane-crazy 2020-05-17 19:33:14 Motor doesn't seem to respond
plane-crazy 2020-05-17 19:32:27 I need to see how it behaves
plane-crazy 2020-05-17 19:31:34 This is something I could look into
plane-crazy 2020-05-17 19:31:18 I see now
plane-crazy 2020-05-17 19:31:16 Ohhh
plane-crazy 2020-05-17 19:28:40 No?
plane-crazy 2020-05-17 19:27:01 What? Motor2 is capable of following the mouse when servo is unticked
plane-crazy 2020-05-17 19:25:59 You can only swap between mouse aim mode and servo mode
plane-crazy 2020-05-17 19:25:28 I kept calling motor2 as servos
plane-crazy 2020-05-17 19:25:14 Actually no
plane-crazy 2020-05-17 19:25:04 Yep
plane-crazy 2020-05-17 19:21:38 I don't seem to have it
plane-crazy 2020-05-17 19:21:30 Anyway, what's this control panel I hear about?
plane-crazy 2020-05-17 19:21:06 Sounds like it was deleted or made private by the owner
plane-crazy 2020-05-17 19:19:59 Great for control surfaces
plane-crazy 2020-05-17 19:19:48 Servo is basically motor except you're limited to a set angle it can travel to
plane-crazy 2020-05-17 19:15:35 Which coincidentally updated the client the second the update went live
plane-crazy 2020-05-17 19:15:15 Blame roblox for negating it
plane-crazy 2020-05-17 19:14:15 That gets updates
plane-crazy 2020-05-17 19:14:09 You can ask the same question to every game
plane-crazy 2020-05-17 19:12:12 ?
plane-crazy 2020-05-17 19:10:31 Was it an event item cos I'm sure I obtained all the seasonal items
plane-crazy 2020-05-17 19:09:22 I don't have it
plane-crazy 2020-05-17 19:07:51 What control panel?
plane-crazy 2020-05-17 19:03:45 Control panel?
plane-crazy 2020-05-17 19:03:33 It's for a flying aircraft carrier where weight changes are frequent
plane-crazy 2020-05-17 19:03:06 I mean, there's servo for that, but it limits to just 2 positions
plane-crazy 2020-05-17 19:02:45 Is there a way to change the propeller pitch without the motors going out of sync?
plane-crazy 2020-05-17 18:14:02 Well, come to think of it I think I can double-stack propellers by salvaging the technology I used for my contra-rotating turboprop engine
plane-crazy 2020-05-17 18:13:02 What peeves me is that you have to make the variable-pitch propellers large because the motors can't handle the rpm
plane-crazy 2020-05-13 16:31:56 Cos I'm now getting frame drops
plane-crazy 2020-05-13 16:31:40 Tbf I think the roblox update negated the performance improvement update
plane-crazy 2020-05-13 15:41:51 If it keeps up, I won't be able to play roblox anymore cos it's so unoptimised
plane-crazy 2020-05-13 15:41:31 Jesus Christ roblox
plane-crazy 2020-05-13 15:07:58 I don't have the patience though
plane-crazy 2020-05-13 15:06:49 Seriously, roblox really needs a built-in translator
plane-crazy 2020-05-13 15:03:26 But it always annoys me when people speak in a language I can't read
plane-crazy 2020-05-13 15:03:08 I have this annoying urge to show the chat every time it has this red marker on it
plane-crazy 2020-05-13 14:57:49 God damn it save system... now I can't remember how I built my fighter
plane-crazy 2020-05-13 14:57:04 My guess is that the loading system is trying to load something empty which answers back as invalid and breaks itself
plane-crazy 2020-05-13 14:56:24 I can load
plane-crazy 2020-05-13 14:52:44 The save system failed
plane-crazy 2020-05-13 14:52:40 Welp... there goes my work
plane-crazy 2020-05-13 14:38:19 Also I'm working on a new fighter and I just realised the save button isn't working
plane-crazy 2020-05-13 14:37:50 Oh
plane-crazy 2020-05-13 14:37:19 And the creations upload requires you to take a full screenshot, not cropped
plane-crazy 2020-05-13 14:36:50 Most likely low effort build
plane-crazy 2020-05-13 14:35:01 I think the save button broke
plane-crazy 2020-05-13 14:34:55 Er guys
plane-crazy 2020-05-13 14:30:33 I accidentally made an X-Wing
plane-crazy 2020-05-13 14:30:26 Uh
plane-crazy 2020-05-13 14:07:26 It has to be mid to late June
plane-crazy 2020-05-13 14:07:19 Bruh
plane-crazy 2020-05-13 14:07:02 Okay the creations are loaded
plane-crazy 2020-05-13 14:06:46 3 updates
plane-crazy 2020-05-13 14:06:05 And then I get ID-17
plane-crazy 2020-05-13 14:05:56 Starting now
plane-crazy 2020-05-13 14:05:37 Hold up a sec rickje I'm still updating
plane-crazy 2020-05-13 14:05:09 uwot
plane-crazy 2020-05-13 14:04:54 I think roblox went out to patch a leak or something
plane-crazy 2020-05-13 14:04:05 What pistons?
plane-crazy 2020-05-13 14:03:25 My creation vanished and then the playerlist vanished
plane-crazy 2020-05-13 14:03:14 Bruh
plane-crazy 2020-05-11 15:03:30 In b4 a flying killbox destroys it in seconds
plane-crazy 2020-05-11 15:00:38 Pontoons
plane-crazy 2020-05-11 09:21:09 It's like school dealing with bullies all over again
plane-crazy 2020-05-11 09:19:50 So now roblox's studio is a hostile workspace
plane-crazy 2020-05-11 09:19:08 *I can only see menu chats*
plane-crazy 2020-05-11 09:19:02 I'm talking about the deprecated safechat
plane-crazy 2020-05-11 09:18:44 What?
plane-crazy 2020-05-11 09:18:07 I would prefer safechat over that unde chat filter
plane-crazy 2020-05-11 09:17:55 Ironically speaking
plane-crazy 2020-05-11 09:17:33 Oh, and roblox now moderates the game coding and scripts the devs wrote
plane-crazy 2020-05-11 09:16:57 I can see how *terribly infuriating* the underage chat filter is
plane-crazy 2020-05-11 09:10:29 The default sound ID better not be raining tacos though
plane-crazy 2020-05-11 09:10:01 You can mute individual user's speakers
plane-crazy 2020-05-11 09:09:23 Why not round to 300?
plane-crazy 2020-05-11 09:09:12 But why a specific price tag
plane-crazy 2020-05-11 09:09:07 Wait, not what
plane-crazy 2020-05-11 09:09:02 Yes what
plane-crazy 2020-05-11 08:48:35 I've built a jet designed for endurance, speed and agility
plane-crazy 2020-05-11 08:48:11 Must be a lot of lag and a fuel guzzler
plane-crazy 2020-05-11 08:48:03 Wew
plane-crazy 2020-05-11 08:47:45 Eh, I use 5 or 6 super rockets to get up to 642
plane-crazy 2020-05-11 08:47:13 Must be using a drive
plane-crazy 2020-05-11 08:46:48 Cos I did so in a steep dive and I got up to 1100 speed before hitting -4800
plane-crazy 2020-05-11 08:46:16 I forgot to add the lines of *In level flight*
plane-crazy 2020-05-11 08:45:39 I don't think anybody can exceed the 700 speed barrier with wing panels and reasonable stability
plane-crazy 2020-05-08 11:54:39 👀
plane-crazy 2020-05-05 19:33:54 There's no dome shapes which is a problem
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 20:01:33 It would wobble all over the place
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 20:01:18 I did a TOW missile once but it had controlling issues
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 20:00:36 They're launched using maxxed out suspension
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 20:00:25 I can't record but here's a screenshot of a 5-round grenade launcher http://prntscr.com/s9dldg
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 19:53:47 I just need to mount the assembly onto a pivot
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 19:53:17 I made a grenade launcher
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 19:51:44 And now I made a new weapon
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 19:51:37 Someone inspired me with that sci-fi AA thing
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 19:46:54 Heck, I'm in Plane Crazy cos the last active Build & Race was shut down
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 19:46:33 Studio's better than plane crazy ngl
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 19:46:11 You gave me an idea
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 19:45:24 But it's a glass-cannon
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 19:45:18 I have a turret that wields 2 miniguns and 6 rocket pods
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 19:45:04 I have
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 19:44:52 Too many details to cover
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 19:44:44 I can't do modern builds
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 19:43:57 This one
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 19:43:44 I almost said 3 cos of the rocket-assisted ejector
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 19:43:32 I have 2 designs of ejector seats that were tried and tested and works
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 19:42:42 Armoured Car, Anti-Aircraft
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 19:42:32 I think it's called AC AA Mk II
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 19:41:48 But it was ineffective against a manned rocket firing rockets
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 19:41:32 I did an AA-tank
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 19:41:06 I can't make an ejector seat without it being 25% reliable
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 19:25:47 I feel like that the jetpack bug patch has also introduced a wing panel bug
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 19:18:24 I'd record it, but roblox uses so much resources that it spares nothing for my recorder to encode
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 19:17:37 Nope, didn't work
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 19:16:10 I'll see
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 19:15:43 I even tried magnet and magnet
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 19:15:33 Nor are 1x0.9?
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 19:15:05 And that's to lift a pilot seat
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 19:14:59 I want to point out that the superstrength magnet failed at one job
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 19:14:12 On my custom jet interceptor, yes
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 19:11:40 I hate how conveyor drives will eat your frames until you activate them
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 17:21:42 It seems impossible to fly level at 700 speed without sacrificing so much handling that it's not worth flying
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 16:26:35 It has a similar vibe to it
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 16:26:29 Is that War Thunder?
plane-crazy 2020-04-30 19:17:36 Sodastream: Hol' up
plane-crazy 2020-04-30 18:45:17 This magnet doesn't want to do anything
plane-crazy 2020-04-30 18:40:34 I thought by unticking it, activating it causes the block attached to the red area to break weld
plane-crazy 2020-04-30 18:40:10 Oh I see
plane-crazy 2020-04-30 18:39:27 What does weld do on magnets?
plane-crazy 2020-04-30 18:26:21 **Curb your Enthusiasm**
plane-crazy 2020-04-30 18:24:04 I'm trying to teach people for god's sake
plane-crazy 2020-04-30 18:23:39 I'm dead confused
plane-crazy 2020-04-30 18:23:37 When I tried to challenge against its filtering here, the staff told me it's roblox, except it isn't roblox
plane-crazy 2020-04-30 18:21:29 Somehow they don't like the word "Ejection" or "Ejector" but "Eject" is okay???
plane-crazy 2020-04-30 18:20:09 For once, the text blocks don't annoy me http://prntscr.com/s8syue
plane-crazy 2020-04-30 17:35:01 Nope
plane-crazy 2020-04-30 17:34:49 Acts as main pilot seat
plane-crazy 2020-04-30 17:34:26 This is really awful when I want to highlight blocks for new players http://prntscr.com/s8s52n
plane-crazy 2020-04-30 12:06:33 Not Top Gun
plane-crazy 2020-04-30 12:06:29 Okay the plane I mentioned comes from the Mission: Impossible scene
plane-crazy 2020-04-30 12:02:41 Okay nvm that was from another movie
plane-crazy 2020-04-30 12:01:31 Especially that one scene when Tony chases an aircraft trundling down the runway
plane-crazy 2020-04-30 12:00:56 If I see a Top Gun scene in <#609381270237216768>, you'll have my vote
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 17:38:06 I probably overdid the description in <#384025409945337856>
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 17:34:47 My largest ship is about 3000 blocks and I will speak from experience, it hurts to ride on it
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 17:33:57 X to Doubt
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 17:33:39 Large builds are nice and all, but they aren't practical
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 17:33:03 Something tells me that the majority of the community prefer large builds over micros
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 16:40:36 You have something loose inside?
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 16:34:52 I've sorted out the front undercarriage on the racer and it looks better
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 16:22:19 It's inspired by the book Hover Car Racer and the game called Jet Ion GP
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 16:21:43 A jet racer
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 16:20:58 Anyway, I don't know if I can improve on the nose without severely affecting the flight characteristics http://prntscr.com/s846f8
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 16:20:13 That opens during the Winter
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 16:11:29 I just hope my suggestion gets implemented, cos I need that reactionary response from my engines in order to have effective air brakes
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 16:08:16 I actually come here to find help rather than <#478584971670454284>
plane-crazy 2020-04-28 20:43:07 Is there a group that associates with jet aircraft built for speed?
plane-crazy 2020-04-28 14:52:44 Why do conveyor drives cause framerate lag?
plane-crazy 2020-04-27 20:05:45 *Never gonna give you up...*
plane-crazy 2020-04-27 19:56:44 Although it was some serious modification
plane-crazy 2020-04-27 19:56:34 I've managed to convert one of my biplanes into a floatplane
plane-crazy 2020-04-27 19:02:01 Hmm I got an idea for a floatplane but I don't know if the physics behind it will work
plane-crazy 2020-04-24 21:55:48 Is that a mechanical calculator?
plane-crazy 2020-04-22 17:15:59 I wonder what the effect is named
plane-crazy 2020-04-22 17:15:47 Aw it doesn't do the splat sound
plane-crazy 2020-04-22 17:09:24 I need it to check if my sound override is working
plane-crazy 2020-04-22 17:09:14 Is there a machine that purposely triggers the humanoid to "trip"?
plane-crazy 2020-04-22 14:50:31 Looks like a V1
plane-crazy 2020-04-22 14:50:05 My new experimental Mark V Airborne Torpedo has passed performance tests for flight handling and deployment http://prntscr.com/s41oki
plane-crazy 2020-04-22 14:47:09 That's gonna leave a headache
plane-crazy 2020-04-22 14:46:11 Reminds me of that haunted piano in Super Mario 64
plane-crazy 2020-04-22 14:34:46 Right now I have a variant of the Sea Damsenfly TF Mk 23 as the Sea Damsenfly Mk 24, Heavy Torpedo Carrier
plane-crazy 2020-04-22 14:33:23 I wish I can name vehicles better...
plane-crazy 2020-04-22 13:29:50 Huh stereos? Finally something that gives personality to my silent running steamship
plane-crazy 2020-04-22 08:42:30 I'm gonna have to rebuild one cos it's borked
plane-crazy 2020-04-22 08:41:41 My helo is incredibly unstable in flight
plane-crazy 2020-04-22 08:40:52 He's speaking the language of the Gods
plane-crazy 2020-04-22 07:55:03 Bringing my steamer and MBT
plane-crazy 2020-04-22 07:53:51 Where's the vip server? I keep forgetting where it is <:kek:652566605028524033>
plane-crazy 2020-04-22 07:50:46 I should send help in my gunboat
plane-crazy 2020-04-22 07:48:59 Dam the steamer looks really good
plane-crazy 2020-04-22 07:23:55 Ah, more slots mean more variations of the same biplane I've been working on for roughly 2 years <:pogey:651848693842182144>
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 20:31:42 *Back to the Future reference*
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 20:31:24 A flying DeLorean?
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 20:29:50 If you were falling, I'd be playing Tom Pretty's Free Fallin' in the background
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 20:26:53 A suspension system that holds a block that holds a row of trapdoors
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 20:26:04 It's simple, really
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 20:23:01 Somehow I always miss the line
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 20:22:46 I've built an arrestor system to bring fast-moving aircraft to a stop on carriers
But...
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 19:44:38 http://prntscr.com/s1y3w0
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 19:43:17 It's a prototype so not much detail is used
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 19:42:38 I made an aircraft catapult that is actually reliable and functional; and doesn't get wheels stuck in the gap where the catapult moves across the deck
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 19:41:49 Lads I think I've done it
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 19:33:02 Anyone having issues with landing gears getting stuck until you retract them?
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 15:50:37 Broke the english only rule <:pogey:651848693842182144>
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 15:50:28 This man
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 15:49:45 I'm pretty sure that 70% of the gaming community doesn't use punctuation
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 15:49:42 So who know if that is an actual question or not
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 14:36:00 Every time I tried to make a small aircraft move fast, they would start spazzing out past 400
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 14:35:35 I wasn't finished talking yet
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 14:35:02 How do I build a small plane that is actually fast?
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 14:11:12 Wow I just saved around 80.000 worth of data <:pogey:651848693842182144>
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 08:21:08 Actually on second thoughts, I haven't really designed a gyroscope that is actually useful
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 08:19:08 In simple terms of what a gyroscope is, it's a heavy mass, spinning really fast
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 08:15:47 Put a gyroscope on it?
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 19:10:36 That's a lot of cameras
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 19:09:34 Make a gif of that
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 07:11:00 Nothing hurts me more than seeing 25% or less PhysicsReal
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 07:08:23 That tells the speed of your physics
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 07:08:11 Look for PhysicsReal
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 07:07:55 You have a deathwish?
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 07:06:03 My physics start chugging at 400 ish blocks
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 07:04:45 You can check the physics speed by shift + F4
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 07:04:31 Mostly due to large creationss
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 20:34:19 I'm just seeing a single white pixel on the website
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 20:33:09 The gif doesn't seem to be working
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 20:29:17 It involved glitching through the base plot with ropes I can't remember anything else
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 20:28:53 I'm trying to remember what contraption I used to reach the speed of light before
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 20:26:52 Other than that, I've reached near infinity when the *Speed of light* role existed
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 20:26:29 I've reached up to 12000 before my control surfaces started to fly away
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 20:25:51 I'm like *Bruh, torpedoes are relatively easy to build*
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 20:25:31 A guy posted a suggestion stating that they want torpedoes
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 20:24:00 It's a side effect for roblox's physics
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 20:21:54 Bruh your discord ping in the video made me become self-aware
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 22:40:00 Apparently I had to reintroduce my javelin to the cobra in order to considerably slow down when using the jump drive
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 22:21:21 Oh god my control surfaces rip off very easily
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 22:17:14 A bit of lag actually causes you to spazz out, speaking from experience
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 22:16:58 Fabric isn't friendly on laggy computers
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 22:16:44 And the control surfaces had been ripped off
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 22:16:21 I went over 12k speed
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 22:14:56 Oh sweet jesus
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 22:10:02 Like this? http://prntscr.com/ryqbr0
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 22:09:33 Alright
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 22:08:13 Behind the 2x2 rockets which I use to display afterburners
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 22:07:48 But whereabouts?
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 22:06:38 My javelin seems to be smaller than that aircraft above http://prntscr.com/ryq9w1
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 22:04:30 Also my javelin jet is surprisingly too small to fit a conveyor drive
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 22:03:52 Seem to fly like a boomerang
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 22:02:48 I see
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 22:02:20 Can't really see what I'm looking at tbf
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 22:01:24 Turned out to be horribly inaccurate and often times the rail gets stuck inside the barrel
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 22:00:37 Although one of my deleted guns used cutters and 4 blocks as rails
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 22:00:10 I fire out explosive balls
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 21:59:28 Although wouldn't work if the gun's sideways or upside down
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 21:59:05 It is what it is: Ammo is fed into the gun breech using gravity
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 21:58:00 Are there any magazine-type systems that don't require the ammo to be gravity fed?
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 21:50:23 Making a jump drive?
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 21:49:51 Er, my biplane has it but it wasn't necessary
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 21:49:27 It's a compromise for lots of speed and acceleration
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 21:49:01 Before conveyors, there were magnet drives
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 21:48:29 Exploiting roblox's physics by creating infinite energy
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 21:47:47 Alright
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 21:46:26 They work great in unjamming the hopper
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 21:46:14 The only build I've used conveyors on is my tennis ball serving machine
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 21:44:02 If you meant the fireworks then you just missed the winter event
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 21:43:36 There's no flare block
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 21:42:48 It doesn't have conveyor drives
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 21:41:50 I'm not ingame but I have an old video demostrating the prototype https://streamable.com/srh45
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 21:41:06 Want to see it? It might shatter your mirrors though
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 21:40:48 Possibly
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 21:40:21 I've seen helicopters here do +300 without missing a beat
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 21:39:53 It also doesn't like to hover either
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 21:39:39 Controls get saturated when I exceed 190 speed and I just flip over and fall out of the sky
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 21:38:54 I'm ripping my hair out from my helicopter
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 21:26:39 Blame roblox
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 21:01:41 Hyperbot autonomously checks the age on roblox?
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 16:24:55 I just realised that one of my ships actually rock in the water
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 15:17:06 10 guns, 12 rockets, a white plastic box on wheels
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 15:16:47 How to be that annoying kid on PC's pvp server starter pack
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 15:16:07 Wth are those rocket pods?
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 15:13:43 Cos physics
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 15:13:30 My torpedoes carried by my aircraft uses aircraft propeller engines instead of water props
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 15:12:58 Funny that you mention torpedoes
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 14:56:17 Are now the bane of my existance
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 14:56:10 Fabric control surfaces
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 14:43:28 Changed the material to sand and the problem went away
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 14:43:13 It was fabric-covered control surfaces that was causing the problem
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 14:42:53 Oh my bloody god
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 14:36:56 I'm changing my material of the wings to something else
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 14:36:11 Plastic aka default
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 14:35:19 Cos it was covered in fabric
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 14:35:11 So is that the source of the spazzing my biplane had?
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 14:34:54 Wait, what?
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 14:33:53 The rest weigh the same as plastic
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 14:33:11 Fascinating... Diamond plate, fabric, foil and ice weighs the same as air
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 14:30:09 I even checked if the physics were sleeping
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 14:29:48 Diamond plate surprisingly weighs the same as fabric
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 14:28:58 Apparently foil and ice weigh nothing compared to air
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 14:28:02 Yes, and the left-most suspension is just air
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 14:27:41 Apparently roblox tagged "Ice" so I used the words "Frozen Water" instead
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 14:26:52 http://prntscr.com/ryhjsf
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 14:25:54 I'm gonna reduce the strength of the suspension to 0.5
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 14:24:02 That's why there's sandbags
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 14:23:36 http://prntscr.com/ryhh2s
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 14:23:33 Omg you're right
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 14:12:10 I'll test that theory rn
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 14:11:53 Shame ballast blocks can't use different materials
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 14:10:54 With the exception of ice and fabric of course
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 14:10:41 But in PC... material is just a texture change
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 14:10:25 I expect it to do so as it's rather dense irl
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 14:08:00 So at maximum speed, the motor could chug out roughly 480 rpm
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 14:06:54 Although not measured accurately cos I was only using my eyes to lap each revolution for roughly 10 seconds
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 14:05:36 Apparently the RPM of the motor at 1 speed is 9.6
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 13:48:15 Anyway I need to build a more reliable explosive ball hopper so I can consistently feed a single ball into the breech
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 13:45:58 For instance, my tennis ball serving machine has a lot more stress on physics and lags a lot more than my prototype fullauto gun
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 13:45:16 It shouldn't be
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 13:44:28 And I lost connection before I saved...
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 13:43:55 And a minute ago, the motor responsible for the gun elevation was just seesawing the entire thing, while the horizontal drive motor would spazz the whole creation by the slight]est touch
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 13:42:04 Motors are bloody weird cos half of my creations work fine with them, while some just spazzes out
plane-crazy 2020-04-12 21:19:12 Absolute mad lad
plane-crazy 2020-04-12 19:51:14 Although I haven't tested for self-destruction in pvp yet
plane-crazy 2020-04-12 19:50:46 I just realised how much fun you can do with explosive balls
plane-crazy 2020-04-12 19:20:08 I see
plane-crazy 2020-04-12 19:16:32 Could someone expand on what it means of the option "Ignore Self" on explosive blocks?
plane-crazy 2020-04-12 08:10:48 Actually nah, but it's close to it though
plane-crazy 2020-04-12 08:08:13 When it wasn't designed to do
plane-crazy 2020-04-12 08:08:02 Apparently I accidentally made my jet able to do a cobra
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 21:16:36 Even then it'll be unstable in flight
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 21:15:17 Yea
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 21:14:13 Also what's with people saying they liked this game and not the other? I feel like they're biased to one game they like because they have more experience with it
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 21:13:15 *No.*
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 21:13:11 Most likely yes irl, in game...
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 20:48:54 Yep
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 20:48:33 With gyroscopic effect
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 20:48:06 The point of adding ballast between the wheels and the motors is to increase the wheel's weight, forcing the wheel down onto the ground more to gain more traction
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 20:47:06 It makes the effect worse
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 20:45:32 If I remove the ballasts and add 5 more pairs of 5x5 fabric cylinders, it won't sag as much, but the effect of acceleration is less
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 20:40:00 Believe me I tried
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 20:39:41 If I add any more, it'll start to sag from the weight
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 20:39:18 http://prntscr.com/rxhp1f
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 20:38:52 Them motors can only hold so much
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 20:38:43 I can't add any more
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 20:38:13 I just can't get enough acceleration with 10 fabric 5x5 cylinderss
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 20:37:40 I hope the new PC map has a baseplate that stretches out for miles
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 20:32:08 10 5x5 fabric cylinder wheels aren't good enough to gain acceleration
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 20:31:46 I could only get up to 720 speed before I reached the end of the plots baseplate :T
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 19:57:25 But it might look hella ugly
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 19:57:15 Oooh I got an idea that could work for my dragster
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 19:53:36 If I were to build the fastest car, I'd gonna need a big enough runway so I can safely accelerate without crashing
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 19:51:21 What I don't like about roblox's water physics is that it's so non-viscous that it's so difficult to create floatplanes
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 14:24:29 oof
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 14:23:54 Can magnets stick to other people's builds?
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 12:35:44 Because roblox has no "air resistance", engines are mounted at the top
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 12:27:54 Turns out the fan mesh isn't symmetrical
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 12:26:22 Ugh I got OCD with the easter island's turbine fans
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 12:22:16 I need to make 6 or 8 of em for one of my ships
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 12:21:59 Anyone got good small designs of a carronade/long gun?
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 12:04:59 That or just plainly rubberbanding
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 12:04:13 I guess it's the result of the actuation of control surfaces that don't get updated nearly enough to prevent overcompensation
plane-crazy 2020-04-07 10:09:15 Normally there's a memes channel but this server rebranded it as the dump
plane-crazy 2020-04-07 10:07:06 I'm gonna drop the biggest nostalgia trip in <#495286269459300364>

plane-crazy 2020-04-07 09:09:19 Problem is that I'm very limited on how big a vehicle can be, owing to sensitive roblox physics speed throttling
plane-crazy 2020-04-07 09:08:30 This is my first experimental helicopter http://prntscr.com/rul2jq

plane-crazy 2020-04-07 08:23:12 Oh I see there's something under the metal dome with rusted bits of pipe
plane-crazy 2020-04-07 08:06:00 Ugh great there goes two of my most reliable aircraft...
plane-crazy 2020-04-07 08:02:54 Shortly after taking off, it would spazz out
plane-crazy 2020-04-07 08:02:28 I don't know what else was added, but I know that now my biplane's flight model has a temperamental behaviour
plane-crazy 2020-04-07 07:36:35 My God wingtip vortices
plane-crazy 2020-04-07 07:36:28 Took discord ages for me to see the latest media contents in development
plane-crazy 2020-04-06 22:14:21 VALVe: First time?
plane-crazy 2020-04-06 22:14:08 So it's been radio silence
plane-crazy 2020-04-06 22:11:30 What's that floating island?
plane-crazy 2020-04-06 22:08:16 Although you might need to fiddle with the motor2 configs, like make both of them the same numbers
plane-crazy 2020-04-06 22:07:42 I had that issue before
plane-crazy 2020-04-04 18:46:28 Looks like image rendering broke
plane-crazy 2020-03-27 22:06:24 I wish I had my own Fairey Swordfish but I don't have the building skills for one
plane-crazy 2020-03-27 20:15:44 Cloud-9 references?
plane-crazy 2020-03-27 09:27:42 And apparently fireworks love to lag behind creations when physics is being throttled
plane-crazy 2020-03-27 09:23:18 I originally thought fixed would be like smoke particles would be static
plane-crazy 2020-03-27 09:22:37 That's funny cos I see no difference
plane-crazy 2020-03-27 09:21:26 I don't get it?
plane-crazy 2020-03-27 09:15:33 What does fixed do on smoke/snow pipes?
plane-crazy 2020-03-26 10:47:05 Also for some reason guns doesn't appear to be working in pvp
plane-crazy 2020-03-26 10:44:02 Theyre not attached by ropes but with disconnectors
plane-crazy 2020-03-26 10:25:04 TFW you want to get ranks for your airship hybrid but this godforsaken rule of having all blocks attached to your vehicle
plane-crazy 2020-03-25 22:50:30 alright now I'm sad again cos I keep reminding myself that I'm subpar with builders here
plane-crazy 2020-03-25 22:49:57 Even though ik it's not gonna be pretty
plane-crazy 2020-03-25 22:49:38 I should try make a motorbike tomorrow
plane-crazy 2020-03-25 22:44:45 I won't win contests
Not by a long shot
plane-crazy 2020-03-25 22:06:56 Very paper light indeed
plane-crazy 2020-03-25 19:10:30 I've built and tested an arrestor hook on the train station roof and seems to work quite well
plane-crazy 2020-03-25 19:09:49 Do anyone use some sort of arrestor wire or catapult on their carriers?
plane-crazy 2020-03-22 18:23:54 likewise
plane-crazy 2020-03-22 18:23:04 I remember the time I was so into a roblox game that I actually subconsciously swore in the chat when I screwed something up quite badly
plane-crazy 2020-03-22 18:22:07 so quad j's confuse the filter?
plane-crazy 2020-03-22 18:20:51 I don't think you can say "Beavis and Butthead"
plane-crazy 2020-03-22 18:20:04 It's weird that any word that relates to the LGBT was censored but it's mostly lifted 2-3 years ago
plane-crazy 2020-03-22 18:19:31 Other letters?
plane-crazy 2020-03-22 18:17:44 Cos crap isn't actually strong enough to be a swear word
plane-crazy 2020-03-22 18:17:14 Somehow in the catalog, badass isn't censored despite the word in part of that word
plane-crazy 2020-03-22 18:16:04 Roblox: Goes out of their way to make their website more accessible for other languages
Also roblox: Slaps the censor on almost every foreign word on chat.
plane-crazy 2020-03-22 18:13:28 So roblox is racist?
plane-crazy 2020-03-22 17:19:12 Most of the time it won't work
plane-crazy 2020-03-22 17:18:49 I have problems with ice
plane-crazy 2020-03-22 17:18:22 It's connected to nothing except the disconnector
plane-crazy 2020-03-22 17:17:58 Now it won't move out of the tube
plane-crazy 2020-03-22 17:17:45 My torpedo tube worked fine until I added disconnectors to improve framerate
plane-crazy 2020-03-22 17:17:21 My god what's wrong with the game
plane-crazy 2020-03-22 13:30:21 nvm the propeller engine seems to magically weld to the block in front that isn't supposed to touch
plane-crazy 2020-03-22 13:28:05 Cos I'm having trouble keeping 1x1 tubes compact
plane-crazy 2020-03-22 13:27:32 Do blocks weld to conveyors?
plane-crazy 2020-03-20 10:08:42 And in most cases... it just gets stuck on the ramp
plane-crazy 2020-03-20 10:08:31 And it's a pretty big missile as well
I even need to give it a ramp to take off
plane-crazy 2020-03-20 10:07:44 But for some reason it likes to wobble uncontrollably at medium speeds
plane-crazy 2020-03-20 10:07:24 I have a mouse-guided missile
plane-crazy 2020-03-20 08:56:37 I hate an engine that has tight tolerances which is next-to-impossible to iron out
plane-crazy 2020-03-20 08:54:20 I build something else that's big-ish and it starts buffeting madly past 100
plane-crazy 2020-03-20 08:53:24 I build something big but it gets throttled back
I build a small aircraft and the top speed is harshly impoverished by the severe buffeting
plane-crazy 2020-03-20 08:52:43 Also physics is very weird on me
plane-crazy 2020-03-20 08:51:44 Already have that
plane-crazy 2020-03-20 08:49:21 If I go any bigger, my frames will drop significantly
Also the physics is throttled down to 12% cos of how big it already is
plane-crazy 2020-03-20 08:48:06 I can't
plane-crazy 2020-03-20 08:45:45 It was a lengthy process of figuring out how to get as much horizontal angle out of it without damaging the looks too much
plane-crazy 2020-03-20 08:43:37 Kinda awkward to get a good camera angle but here it is: http://prntscr.com/rjhjyp
plane-crazy 2020-03-20 08:41:20 I've got 2 working turrets which includes the tail gunner
plane-crazy 2020-03-20 08:34:41 It's not really fun when 75% of the pvp servers always contain at least one killbox
plane-crazy 2020-03-20 08:32:18 I'm surprised you use engines instead of harnessing roblox's water physics
plane-crazy 2020-03-19 19:10:45 How can I request a rank from creations?
plane-crazy 2020-03-19 19:09:08 I smell *Pestilence*
plane-crazy 2020-03-15 20:46:32 I just noticed that you can now shut off the rocket engines from emitting particles
plane-crazy 2020-03-15 20:25:22 I guess it makes sense cos most people join with ideas but their dedication drains extremely quickly
plane-crazy 2020-03-15 20:21:18 Does it mean by overall playtime of players?
plane-crazy 2020-03-15 20:21:06 What does most engaging mean?
plane-crazy 2020-03-15 20:19:59 Maybe by average?
plane-crazy 2020-03-01 17:02:39 What causes the aircraft to buffet violently at high speeds?
plane-crazy 2020-02-29 10:31:35 It reminds me of the book *Hover Car Racer*
plane-crazy 2020-02-29 10:30:33 You have a decent point, although wheels are really underpowered when it comes to inclines
plane-crazy 2020-02-29 10:29:50 I fear the hover blocks will be overshadowing the wheels because of their excellent ability to traverse terrain
plane-crazy 2020-01-14 18:29:39 I just noticed the hammer emoji on the game name - Does that mean the map expansion is currently underway?
plane-crazy 2020-01-10 19:17:44 This is gonna be interesting when I strap a rudimentary GAU gun to a Javelin
plane-crazy 2020-01-10 19:13:17 Cos apparently it causes the rounds to scatter depending on the speed of the spin
plane-crazy 2020-01-10 19:11:46 Say, against air targets
plane-crazy 2020-01-10 19:11:38 in terms of combat effectiveness, how effective is strapping a load of guns onto a rotating 3x3 cylinder
plane-crazy 2020-01-01 23:01:46 People keep telling me to get a new pc but that's easier said than done
plane-crazy 2020-01-01 23:00:43 Physics throttling is the main issue
plane-crazy 2020-01-01 23:00:31 But due to the nature of roblox, I can't fly it properly
plane-crazy 2020-01-01 23:00:12 I have built a heli based on the swashplate
plane-crazy 2020-01-01 22:13:59 And somehow rockets no longer self-detonate
plane-crazy 2020-01-01 22:13:32 I thought I could use them as flak but it's pitiful
plane-crazy 2020-01-01 22:13:16 I generally still use rockets because fireworks just don't have the range
plane-crazy 2020-01-01 22:12:35 What made them obsolete
plane-crazy 2020-01-01 22:12:28 Well yes but that's not what I mean
plane-crazy 2020-01-01 22:12:04 What do people mean that pvp rockets were obsolete?
plane-crazy 2020-01-01 22:00:42 Firework rockets make excellent flak... if only the range was significantly increased
plane-crazy 2019-12-07 21:24:20 Discord API was failing
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 15:11:24 I use the old anchor block so my creation doesn't lag when it's stationary
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 15:10:52 Also what's with the anchored block?
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 15:02:22 Why is it even called the Great war when the Battle of the Somme slaughtered hundred thousands?
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 15:01:49 Just like in the Great war
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 15:01:40 No you're right
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 15:01:16 Last one went dead because roblox changed their save system
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 15:00:52 Well anyone heard of Build & Race
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 15:00:34 Bruh a suicide mission is just an excuse to distract the opponent
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 14:59:32 Ignore it or accept it
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 14:59:26 Well that's up to you
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 14:59:00 You have my word
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 14:58:48 I foresee that in the next decade there will be another world war
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 14:57:59 I'm gonna check my 8-ball to see if my foresight is true
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 14:56:34 I just don't trust anyone anymore
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 14:56:21 Good point because I don't have faith in humanity
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 14:55:45 Otherwise get the heccin outta here
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 14:55:34 Everyone should get their fair share
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 14:55:26 It's about equality
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 14:54:37 If you like try take over the entire text channel then I would be bothered about it very much
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 14:54:18 What I mean by that, is the frequency of content
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 14:53:55 In fact they're all the same
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 14:53:31 I'm in no position to hate or like furries
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 14:52:56 That's a shame cos I had potential
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 14:52:29 Oh well...
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 14:52:17 Wait a minute
Didn't I apply for a mod several months ago?
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 14:51:12 I need to go upload some images to get the two ranks I should have gotten several months ago
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 14:50:57 Now if you excuse me
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 14:50:05 And so that rank was gone
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 14:49:48 Cos everyone was like
*Hey let's go ask Clang to send us twice the speed of light!*
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 14:49:06 But it was made obsolete
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 14:48:58 I *had* a rank
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 14:46:07 But I can't because every time I go build it, I immediately get depressed because I keep thinking about <#384025409945337856>
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 14:45:35 Speaking of design, I always wanted to build a replica of a fighter-bomber from the 40's
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 14:44:33 Where's the art in that?
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 14:44:27 They make a box on wheels, slapped some guns and stuff on it and called it a day
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 14:44:05 But at the same time, those *bloody killboxes* ruin the fun
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 14:43:52 PvP is great because I can durability test my aircraft and effectiveness of my AAA against fast targets
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 14:43:16 When I spawn it in, it spazzes the moment it touches the ground
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 14:43:04 But it was useless because... well
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 14:42:57 I did have a plane that had a tighter turn circle of less than 1s
plane-crazy 2019-11-25 20:22:32 A die is nice and all, but I respect the 8-Ball more than the fair-sided die
plane-crazy 2019-11-25 20:21:49 What's with the bot that randomly posts an image of a dice
plane-crazy 2019-11-24 22:30:00 Y'know I've seen a mending book being traded for 7 emeralds and a book
plane-crazy 2019-11-24 20:05:04 Not saying I could use a hand here
plane-crazy 2019-11-24 20:04:46 Well that's handy
plane-crazy 2019-11-24 20:04:15 Are those hands?
plane-crazy 2019-11-24 20:01:12 Next time sing along the number line all the way to infinity
plane-crazy 2019-11-24 14:14:07 o look a good boi
plane-crazy 2019-11-23 20:12:04 I don't usually play minecraft outside modding
plane-crazy 2019-11-23 20:10:48 Concealing your age is obviously an offense
plane-crazy 2019-11-21 20:23:37 I see roblox has finally implemented that ugly new robux icon
plane-crazy 2019-11-20 20:36:04 FTW you want to move your camera in first person but the seat is either too low or too high from the windscreen to see properly
plane-crazy 2019-11-20 20:27:28 Oh my
plane-crazy 2019-11-20 20:27:08 Doesn't everybody build a car bomb at least once in the game?
plane-crazy 2019-11-20 20:25:46 Ah well, nobody's perfect CForce
plane-crazy 2019-11-20 20:24:51 And to this day, I no longer have a clean record... oops
plane-crazy 2019-11-20 19:53:30 Unless you're going perfectly straight, it'll try to shake you off like rodeo
plane-crazy 2019-11-17 11:10:13 Oh dear
plane-crazy 2019-11-15 18:02:22 Theory: Rickje is a relative of John Wayne
plane-crazy 2019-11-15 18:00:26 Kat-ta-dam
plane-crazy 2019-11-15 17:58:39 Despite the J in it
plane-crazy 2019-11-15 17:58:30 I always pronounced it as Rickie
plane-crazy 2019-11-15 17:58:21 Eh
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 23:16:23 That's still a lot from my perspective
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 23:16:14 Bruh
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 23:08:13 I just realised you can ping a colour
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 23:07:25 Committing tax fraud
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 23:00:25 I can't seem to find any vip servers here
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 22:58:15 I have another plane in the works but I'm not motivated to build it cos nobody gives me constructive critism on my older builds
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 22:57:17 Not easy trying to make a build that everyone will like
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 22:32:41 But I cant put my finger on it
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 22:32:35 That music sounds familiar
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 22:31:37 Is it run by a human that has working hours?
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 22:15:05 <:RapidUnscheduledDisassembly:592979206800146472>
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 22:12:51 You have regretti
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 22:07:48 The Italians kept changing sides during the war
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 22:07:00 Long range strat bomber, The Lancaster
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 22:06:44 Although the stall speed is relatively high
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 22:06:21 My cruising speed for my bomber is around 420
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 21:53:33 Ms. Frizzle! I think we're going the wrong wa-
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 21:52:40 Is that a community server
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 21:48:50 I don't mean to get controversial but what is a explosive block?
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 21:47:02 Isn't oatmeal porridge?
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 21:46:14 I always made it bitter somehow
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 21:45:53 Until 2 weeks ago, I couldn't get my tea right
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 21:37:24 Funnily enough, even speed plays a role with the overall strength of the motor
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 21:36:58 Maybe the servos/motors don't have enough torque or speed
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 21:36:11 wdym by breaking
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 21:35:47 Yep my current javelin model has a maximum stall speed of 220
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 21:34:10 I always come back to base with a branch from a tree that's not planted locally
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 21:33:43 They're a nuisance even when I fly a plane at tree-top level to ground-pound
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 21:33:15 I don't see the point in trees other than being an obstruction for larger builds
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 21:32:02 The new map concept is basically an extension
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 21:29:21 So now it's 240 ish
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 21:29:11 But since then, I removed the canards because I repositioned the main thrust engines to help with the heavy nose
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 21:28:08 My old Javelin without canards could do 350 before the nose got too much authority
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 21:26:47 Also is that airstrip long enough for some rookie engineer's aircraft that has a stupidly high stall speed?

plane-crazy 2019-11-06 21:19:36 fps and limited aim speed doesn't mix well for me
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 21:19:25 I have it on xbox but...
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 21:18:17 on second thoughts it doesn't stop me from showing it WIP
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 21:17:15 I would but I'm currently rebuilding the wings to fit in retractable landing gears
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 21:16:40 Although the model shown is several months out of date
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 21:16:20 Bigger than this
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 21:12:41 Blimey the bombers easily trump my lancaster

plane-crazy 2019-10-28 19:59:41 I hate to see the terrain still being attempted to render at +4000m at quality 1
plane-crazy 2019-10-28 19:59:19 Like, an actual render distance slider
plane-crazy 2019-10-28 19:59:05 I really wish roblox would be more specific with graphic controls
plane-crazy 2019-10-27 11:09:14 Underaged children
plane-crazy 2019-10-27 11:08:52 ^
plane-crazy 2019-10-27 11:08:40 Yeah - especially those that don't belong in discord.
plane-crazy 2019-10-27 11:07:45 Please, let this be a more civilized community
plane-crazy 2019-10-27 11:07:12 Indeed. It had a bad history
plane-crazy 2019-10-27 11:06:41 If you don't know if you're going to get warned for saying something, don't say it
plane-crazy 2019-10-27 11:05:17 The weight different isn't that significant though
plane-crazy 2019-10-27 11:04:25 But they probably didn't notice that fuel blocks change their weight based on the amount of fuel inside
plane-crazy 2019-10-27 11:04:02 Funnyingly enough, people complain that this game isn't realistic
plane-crazy 2019-10-27 11:03:29 <@!435864400235200522> Yes they can at red fuel stations, even those that aren't connected to the vehicle
plane-crazy 2019-10-27 11:02:58 But now it's a symbol everybody needs to forget
plane-crazy 2019-10-27 11:02:48 It used to be a religious symbol
plane-crazy 2019-10-27 08:46:36 WHat the my engine does 1018 speed compared to super rockets 668
plane-crazy 2019-10-27 08:22:35 Why does adding a few propeller blades cause the entire build to spazz out?
plane-crazy 2019-10-27 08:09:54 I wonder when we'll receive double-sided motors? Y'know, act as ball bearings or 2-n-1
plane-crazy 2019-10-26 21:49:29 It's rolling coal
plane-crazy 2019-10-26 21:49:25 Nah
plane-crazy 2019-10-26 21:48:55 That's gonna fail its MOT test
plane-crazy 2019-10-26 21:34:33 Your cat just huffed catnip
plane-crazy 2019-10-26 21:33:57 Teeth are real, I'm just not convinced with that blurry looking ring on it
plane-crazy 2019-10-26 21:14:51 Ideal for restricting angle to prevent builds from glitching out
plane-crazy 2019-10-26 21:14:23 Servo disables the motor2 from moving by mouse movement
Instead becomes more or less like a motorised hinge
plane-crazy 2019-10-26 21:00:24 Lmao I'm upvoting that suggestion just because it's funny to add a quote
plane-crazy 2019-10-26 20:58:57 Anyway I'm gonna go play WT with the Wyvern
plane-crazy 2019-10-26 20:55:42 Wait you're thinking about the Taranto raid?
plane-crazy 2019-10-26 20:54:58 No that's the Lancaster with their Tallboy bombs
plane-crazy 2019-10-26 20:53:31 If you're thinking about the Bismarck, just remember the time that all it took was a squadron of swordfish to cripple her
plane-crazy 2019-10-26 20:51:20 Because we are so good that we have to always give our enemies a sporting chance
plane-crazy 2019-10-26 20:50:20 wydm many ships are NSFW?
plane-crazy 2019-10-26 20:44:49 Although I liked the HMS *Illustrious* cos it carried Fairey Swordfish biplane torpedo bombers
plane-crazy 2019-10-26 20:43:59 Ah yes. She's a beast.
plane-crazy 2019-10-26 20:43:36 Ark Royal? Sounds familiar
plane-crazy 2019-10-26 20:31:59 So is mine, but it will be used for another build
plane-crazy 2019-10-26 20:30:06 Also why is one propeller spinning faster than the other?
plane-crazy 2019-10-26 20:29:20 That's not exactly fashionable is it?
plane-crazy 2019-10-26 20:29:04 Eh?
plane-crazy 2019-10-26 20:25:03 Only Pingu <:Noot:557284820246331394> <:Noot:557284820246331394>
plane-crazy 2019-10-26 18:54:14 I think this next creation of mine will give me the inventor rank :)
plane-crazy 2019-10-26 15:12:20 Really? That complicates things...
plane-crazy 2019-10-26 15:11:42 What is the max range in blocks can a magnet reach?
plane-crazy 2019-10-26 14:55:47 How does one build a hoverboard ingame
plane-crazy 2019-10-25 21:22:30 They should have just named it attract and repel
plane-crazy 2019-10-25 21:21:48 Which way on the magnets is forwards and backwards?
plane-crazy 2019-10-25 21:18:32 Which way on the magnets is forwards and backwards?
plane-crazy 2019-10-25 20:43:37 I wish I can materialise the magnets into ice
plane-crazy 2019-10-25 19:51:02 Why? Only fly-tippers go there
plane-crazy 2019-10-25 19:50:43 It's a bit top heavy especially when it attacks
plane-crazy 2019-10-25 19:50:33 Oh well, I'll just use that to fine-tune my battlebot
plane-crazy 2019-10-25 19:50:19 Oh...
plane-crazy 2019-10-25 19:49:33 It's already over? 🙁
plane-crazy 2019-10-25 19:36:49 I want to participate
plane-crazy 2019-10-25 19:36:41 Darn it I'm late
plane-crazy 2019-10-25 19:36:07 Is that battlebots?
plane-crazy 2019-10-25 19:31:03 I'm just about to be finished with my first battlebot
plane-crazy 2019-10-25 19:30:49 Cool
plane-crazy 2019-10-25 19:30:38 No ballast blocks either?
plane-crazy 2019-10-25 19:26:46 Does the battlebot have to be within 10x10x10 space?
plane-crazy 2019-10-25 18:58:43 What are the requirements for battlebots, aside the cutter limit?
plane-crazy 2019-10-25 18:55:17 Cos the entire blade is made entirely of cutters
plane-crazy 2019-10-25 18:54:47 You know why?
plane-crazy 2019-10-25 18:54:40 I just realised my bulldozer can't make it into the battlebots arena ;(
plane-crazy 2019-10-25 18:53:28 I need to test it with my biplane later - it's prone to spazzing out from physics lag
plane-crazy 2019-10-25 18:53:12 Yes
plane-crazy 2019-10-25 18:53:04 I don't have a computer to control the heli to stop it from falling out of the sky
plane-crazy 2019-10-25 18:52:36 At least I switched over to motor2 but I still have another problem
plane-crazy 2019-10-25 18:51:44 Even ice just won't cut it
plane-crazy 2019-10-25 18:51:38 My heli requests super strong pistons
plane-crazy 2019-10-25 16:15:33 I'm working on a prototype helicopter, and no matter what I do, it always tries to pitch up, even the COM is center of the main rotor's motor
plane-crazy 2019-10-25 16:11:48 How compact are retractable custom landing gears?
plane-crazy 2019-10-25 15:26:13 How compact are retractable landing gears? Cylinder 2 2x2 or 3x3 as wheels
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 08:18:37 Cos I'm stuck *requesting server*
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 08:18:24 Anyone getting issues connecting to the game?
plane-crazy 2019-10-23 18:37:57 I'm gonna try make my first VTOL jet. I'll see how that goes
plane-crazy 2019-10-22 16:32:02 Ship as in boat
plane-crazy 2019-10-22 16:31:52 I can in fact land a ship on top of a carrier
plane-crazy 2019-10-22 16:29:53 If ye have an aircraft carrier, my naval biplane can land and take off easily
plane-crazy 2019-10-22 16:28:17 Thatta be the last thing you wanna do to them
plane-crazy 2019-10-22 16:27:52 Oi don't diss the HRs
plane-crazy 2019-10-22 16:27:31 Locking motors help
plane-crazy 2019-10-22 16:26:47 Cos 12% physics speed is anything but fun
plane-crazy 2019-10-22 16:26:38 So how do I make roblox think that my pc is faster than it is
plane-crazy 2019-10-22 16:26:15 I'm pretty sure "bigger map" was already suggested
plane-crazy 2019-10-22 16:25:18 Across the sea
plane-crazy 2019-10-22 16:25:11 Actually that'll be fun, flying from airport to other airports
plane-crazy 2019-10-22 16:24:46 I wanna go on a cruise flight
plane-crazy 2019-10-22 16:24:35 ikr
plane-crazy 2019-10-22 16:24:10 Although I'm throttled to 33% physics speed so I wasn't actually doing 662 speed
plane-crazy 2019-10-22 16:23:14 So I've accidentally made my replication of the *Javelin* which is a subsonic FAW, a supersonic FB ingame
plane-crazy 2019-10-22 16:21:35 Quite frankly, in order to fly faster than that barrier, I need to build an aircraft big enough to not buffet to oblivion past 450 speed
plane-crazy 2019-10-22 16:20:57 Except it doesn't stabilise the aircraft when it exceeds the barrier
plane-crazy 2019-10-22 16:20:23 I just realised that I have my own "physical barrier" similar to the sonic boom
plane-crazy 2019-10-08 20:45:20 Because of physics lag, I can't build it so small that physics can't keep up, nor build it so big that physics starts throttling back
plane-crazy 2019-10-08 20:44:41 Building the perfect fighter jet is more complicated than I thought
plane-crazy 2019-10-08 20:09:19 Isn't this plane crazy channel designated for plane crazy discussions only?
plane-crazy 2019-10-08 20:08:14 How does one build a rocket with engines at the bottom instead of being at the top where it is more stable
plane-crazy 2019-10-08 19:18:34 Ironically speaking, nothing is stronger than pistons
plane-crazy 2019-10-05 16:13:43 Ah beg your pardon
plane-crazy 2019-10-05 16:13:17 It isn't? Clarkson design it didn't he?
plane-crazy 2019-10-05 16:12:56 Well.. the Peel P55
plane-crazy 2019-10-05 15:26:03 I'm not complaining or anything but magnets and their "superstrength" is just far weaker than I expected
plane-crazy 2019-10-05 14:39:59 They aren't exactly superheroes though
plane-crazy 2019-10-05 14:39:46 Magnets with "superstrength"
plane-crazy 2019-10-05 14:22:37 I was trying to replace the pistons which are too weak
plane-crazy 2019-10-05 14:22:24 Absolutely nothing except trying to lag the server
plane-crazy 2019-10-05 14:21:24 It did nothing what I expected
plane-crazy 2019-10-05 14:21:20 Seriously though
plane-crazy 2019-10-05 14:20:01 What is superstrength on the magnets?
plane-crazy 2019-10-05 14:04:36 Either I'm using it wrong or it's just not strong enough compared to half-pistons
plane-crazy 2019-10-05 14:03:54 What's superstrength on magnets?
plane-crazy 2019-10-04 21:37:50 *Do you like anime?*
That's a complicated question.
plane-crazy 2019-10-04 19:44:08 It's impossible for me to go past 550 spd without experiencing loss of controls
plane-crazy 2019-10-04 19:43:36 Welp there goes my plans to make a high speed interceptor
plane-crazy 2019-10-04 19:42:34 Left to right yeah
plane-crazy 2019-10-04 19:41:31 What does it mean when my aircraft fishtails at high speeds / near large builds?
plane-crazy 2019-10-04 19:37:15 What does it mean if my aircraft fishtails left to right at speed?
plane-crazy 2019-10-04 19:28:36 Would be nice if the strength of pistons would be buffed or rope have an acceleration slider
plane-crazy 2019-10-02 17:53:30 TFW you try to make the EE Lightning ingame but 1x1 and 3x3 engines are too large/small
plane-crazy 2019-10-02 17:52:49 Hmmst
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 17:27:50 Now it's tripled
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 17:27:42 Like the latest creation which last year might be expected 2 dislikes
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 17:27:07 I mean
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 17:25:55 Is it me or people started to expect higher expectations in <#384025409945337856>
plane-crazy 2019-09-30 22:00:35 They have a mafia?
plane-crazy 2019-09-29 18:44:03 It took me a while to realise the lava is gone
plane-crazy 2019-09-29 18:12:45 I killed a motor!  http://prntscr.com/pcjk5s
plane-crazy 2019-09-29 10:35:54 Reminds me of the time I had an orange screen of death during the heatwave
plane-crazy 2019-09-29 10:35:34 Missing or corrupt kernel page so it's a storage drive related issue
plane-crazy 2019-09-29 10:34:21 That BSOD
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 17:33:28 I kinda ashamed that I won't be roleplaying in the badlands anytime soon
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 17:02:53 Or by the amount of hashtags they are spewing out
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 16:59:37 Whitelist has been suggested a lot but is not planned atm
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 16:59:13 Yeah
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 16:54:56 Turn off servo for mouse aiming
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 16:54:46 Bruh
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 16:54:34 In motor2?
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 16:54:14 I can't fit it inside a jet because of how big suspension is
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 16:54:05 Suspension is more reliable than springs but
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 16:53:55 Oh for goodness sake
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 16:51:31 I thought it's released
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 16:51:28 Eh?
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 16:42:59 Spring is basically suspension except pre-tensioned
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 16:42:23 And only one works reliably
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 16:42:12 I got a number of ejector seats prototypes built
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 16:41:21 Suspension too big in build mode
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 16:41:04 I have to wait until it retracts and then activate again for the full strength
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 16:40:42 I hate how the spring becomes either stupidly weak or not work at all when it activates with *break weld*
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 15:52:09 Those gear wheels just slide all over the place
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 15:51:58 Cos I have to apply downforce to my plane in order to steer sufficiently enough
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 15:51:25 I wish the gear wheels have more friction
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 09:34:14 I just realised that you can make a working periscope cos the water is always opaque on both sides
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 09:26:30 Furry is a religion?
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 09:19:49 That's why I said that in <#384021699466756107>
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 09:19:39 ingame
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 09:19:22 Cos sonar technology isn't here yet
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 09:19:11 Anyone know how to increase the fog distance underwater?
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 18:31:27 You're after the dark grey colours right?
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 17:52:36 Funny how I can't replicate a plane from irl deliberately but can by accident
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 16:02:21 Oh gosh you should
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 16:01:37 No, he meant that he made a piano that coincidentally falls on top of people during science experiments
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 16:00:18 It'll float for a few seconds and then the buoyancy fails
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 16:00:00 If it was a flannel and you throw it at a body of water
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 15:59:44 Tablecloth? Makes sense
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 15:59:23 Or is that what I think - Adjustable on the fly?
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 15:59:09 Don't we already have ballasts?
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 15:58:26 It's from Final Fantasy but I prefer the roblox one better
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 15:57:26 Why does that image remind me of the music *One Winged Angel* ?
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 15:56:53 Right
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 15:55:51 Only issue is that the propeller which counters the torque twisting of the main rotor is causing the helicopter to drift horizontally
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 15:54:52 So I did a swashplate experiment and it has promising results
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 15:50:56 It's crazy world
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 17:12:29 I see. I can't stand getting an eyesore so intense that it would hurt less staring at a television that my mother used to complain
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 17:10:49 I did have a look with BTRoblox but their custom themes were only half-baked
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 17:09:41 That's been fixed though?
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 17:09:03 But who cares to a person who has a robux cash flow of a ditch in the drought season
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 17:08:17 Although it comes with limited notifier
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 17:07:58 *Quite frankly, I've became increasingly disappointed in the last few months*
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 17:07:41 Or ROBLOX+ if you paid premium for dark theme
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 17:06:40 Even ROBLOX+ finally pulled the plug on the OBC theme
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 17:06:05 And their website theme which is nothing but a slapped on two-tone office theme
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 17:05:37 How? Take roblox's motto which is "Powering Imagination"
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 17:05:16 That is *ironic*
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 17:05:09 Let's be clear
plane-crazy 2019-09-21 14:15:42 http://prntscr.com/p93dn7 Future generations growing up not knowing what a floppy disk looks like
plane-crazy 2019-09-21 12:44:47 G O O S E
plane-crazy 2019-09-21 09:49:39 Real veterans know what freebuild is
plane-crazy 2019-09-21 09:33:14 You can't change the shape of the suspension in build mode?
plane-crazy 2019-09-21 09:26:28 *In build mode*
plane-crazy 2019-09-21 09:04:00 Or as many suspensions so the catapult can actually reach near the edge...
plane-crazy 2019-09-21 09:03:04 I wish there are taller suspensions in build mode so I don't have to put down as many ropes which can potentially spazz out when I tension the springs
plane-crazy 2019-09-21 08:56:47 Is good
plane-crazy 2019-09-20 22:12:27 <:OkBuddy:518518403686989856>
plane-crazy 2019-09-20 22:10:35 Why do we want R15 in the game when all that processing could have been better spent on rope physics
plane-crazy 2019-09-20 22:10:03 Let's face it
plane-crazy 2019-09-20 20:17:48 What's Restitution?
plane-crazy 2019-09-20 20:15:29 Could someone explain what Restitution is for ropes?
plane-crazy 2019-09-19 20:40:31 Don't you hate it when you use suspension and when you drive over rough terrain, it sometimes collapses and can't move back into position
plane-crazy 2019-09-19 20:39:29 *Wheeze*
plane-crazy 2019-09-19 20:39:09 What's 42?
plane-crazy 2019-09-19 20:38:27 The wall of shame
plane-crazy 2019-09-19 20:37:49 I literally can't hear anything unless I turn my camera against the sound sources
plane-crazy 2019-09-19 20:37:22 Also what's with roblox forcing on spatial sound
plane-crazy 2019-09-19 20:36:58 Just stick to using the iron cross
plane-crazy 2019-09-19 20:36:33 Ironically it used to be a religious symbol which used to be *good.*
Sadly other people had ideas...
plane-crazy 2019-09-14 16:47:08 And other games are fine
plane-crazy 2019-09-14 16:46:58 I never used speakers
plane-crazy 2019-09-14 16:44:41 Like I can't or barely hear footsteps or engines even at 100% volume
plane-crazy 2019-09-14 16:41:20 Now why is my roblox so quiet
plane-crazy 2019-09-14 16:31:17 Correction: 400 spd
plane-crazy 2019-09-14 16:30:23 I think I got an idea
plane-crazy 2019-09-14 16:29:58 So 200 spd at lvl slight and 600 block creation being powered by a single prop engine?
plane-crazy 2019-09-14 08:24:43 I think I'll go get some ranks today
plane-crazy 2019-09-14 08:23:30 Anyone know how to increase the force of pistons? I need at least two of them to counter a motor turning at 0.1 torque and every time I add another piston, I will lose controllability of the helicopter
plane-crazy 2019-09-14 08:21:32 Really nice pixel art
plane-crazy 2019-09-14 08:20:24 I like your building style
You crudely make out the basic shape and when you're satisfied with it, you shift up a gear
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 18:15:46 Yes heli are basically VTOL but that name only applies to fixed wing aircraft
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 18:07:10 Your silence speaks volumes
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 18:06:09 Anyone tried making a heli without engines?
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 18:23:38 I kinda want to design it around the classic rotor and propeller system
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 18:22:07 Like how would it balance
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 18:21:37 Is it possible to build a heli that doesn't use engines to control
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 16:55:48 Right
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 16:55:33 How many shots of the gun does it take to destroy a block?
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 16:42:32 Anyone know why this http://prntscr.com/p4cucy keeps happening every time I jump out of my seat
plane-crazy 2019-09-09 20:51:26 Thanks to the new guns, my airship can be more defensible
plane-crazy 2019-09-09 20:49:45 *Here he comes!*
plane-crazy 2019-09-09 20:49:36 I think Rickje likes motor motor
plane-crazy 2019-09-09 20:49:24 Look out!
plane-crazy 2019-09-09 20:49:11 Motor2
plane-crazy 2019-09-08 20:33:54 Oh that's cool
plane-crazy 2019-09-08 20:33:35 There's always that one person who spams the crap out of random blocks or make a killbox
plane-crazy 2019-09-08 20:33:17 Yes.
plane-crazy 2019-09-08 20:32:13 Well actually I don't need to worry about it cos mine is a hybrid
plane-crazy 2019-09-08 20:31:57 Is an airship considered a ship by rank?
plane-crazy 2019-09-08 19:04:08 That's why my airship is behaving weird lately
plane-crazy 2019-09-08 19:03:07 Right...
plane-crazy 2019-09-08 19:02:45 Center of mass of the vehicle?
plane-crazy 2019-09-08 19:02:32 With helium, what does it mean by "Apply at Centre"?
plane-crazy 2019-09-08 13:39:27 Why are the planes asymmetrical by the tail section?
plane-crazy 2019-09-08 13:03:21 Now I have to open task manager for the bloody third time
plane-crazy 2019-09-08 13:03:10 Oh for God's sake...
plane-crazy 2019-09-08 13:03:02 *ROBLOX silently crashes in the background*
plane-crazy 2019-09-08 13:02:06 Replace the head with a motor
plane-crazy 2019-09-08 13:00:00 It's Megamotor!
plane-crazy 2019-09-08 10:51:26 I do not appreciate that joke <@530800381794451487>
plane-crazy 2019-09-08 10:37:18 Nobody told me that was fixed
plane-crazy 2019-09-08 10:37:12 ...oh.
plane-crazy 2019-09-08 10:37:03 can't*
plane-crazy 2019-09-08 10:36:46 Me and some other people can
plane-crazy 2019-09-08 10:36:39 Well rip
plane-crazy 2019-09-08 10:36:27 Can you people hear engines?
plane-crazy 2019-09-08 10:25:08 That boat's a ninja
plane-crazy 2019-09-08 10:24:29 For some reason that reminds me of Jaws
plane-crazy 2019-09-08 10:22:38 Oof now it can't accelerate in a slight incline
plane-crazy 2019-09-08 10:18:29 I'll just paint the entire bottom part metal
plane-crazy 2019-09-08 10:18:15 More weight...
plane-crazy 2019-09-08 10:17:43 It's actually 2.5 blocks tall, counting the rear spoiler
plane-crazy 2019-09-08 10:17:30 I glorified about my car's height a bit
plane-crazy 2019-09-08 10:13:55 Downforce helps significantly but it drastically decreases max speed and still has a critical speed where downforce doesn't prevent a roll-over
plane-crazy 2019-09-08 10:13:06 I would do that, but that would strip its ability to keep all wheels on the uneven ground
plane-crazy 2019-09-08 10:12:25 And I've already put the ride height so low I would scrape the marmalade off the toast
plane-crazy 2019-09-08 10:11:43 Unfortunately my car is only 1 block high
plane-crazy 2019-09-08 10:11:23 Yes
plane-crazy 2019-09-08 10:10:49 What would help with anti-rolling, 100 stiffness or 50 stiffness on the suspension? My car has a low center of mass
plane-crazy 2019-09-07 10:17:48 I wish the gear legs were thicker so it doesn't go right through blocks
plane-crazy 2019-09-07 10:08:29 The angle indicates how wide the beam will be
plane-crazy 2019-09-07 10:08:10 "Can't allow that"
plane-crazy 2019-09-07 10:08:00 But roblox physics be like:
plane-crazy 2019-09-07 10:07:54 I was gonna build an airport tug
plane-crazy 2019-09-07 09:29:32 Do winter wheels provide more traction than regular wheels without snow?
plane-crazy 2019-09-07 09:21:31 That also means my torpedo won't make the cut either
plane-crazy 2019-09-07 09:21:17 That's a shame
plane-crazy 2019-09-07 09:20:20 Has anyone made a pushback truck yet
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 22:00:52 And ball wheels
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 22:00:38 Seriously I don't know why gear legs spazz out on my biplanes
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 21:59:52 If speed demon was still around, all you need is gear legs and a biplane with a seriously low stall speed http://prntscr.com/p2uzg0
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 21:00:41 But not to all my other planes
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 21:00:12 For some reason the landing gear wheels start to spazz out on my biplane specifically
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 22:13:12 <:OkBuddy:518518403686989856>
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 22:12:22 nevertheless, performance improvements are always a big welcome
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 22:11:33 Although I was expecting the control surface hinge to be attached to the adjacent and opposite sides
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 22:10:17 Although more round than the delta wing

plane-crazy 2019-09-03 22:10:03 Here it is
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 22:09:08 Ah... the Mark IX
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 22:07:06 Well the engine sometimes spits flames when it starts up
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 22:06:14 Can a Spitfire spit fire?
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 22:05:21 Speaking of which, I added some ballasts to my torpedo and now it looks like a mini submarine
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 22:04:37 Like, 2 plane steering, under surface guiding, wire controlled
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 22:03:23 How much practicality can you put into a torpedo before it becomes unpractical
plane-crazy 2019-09-02 16:09:59 I can't seem to hear any engines ingame. Is it just me?
plane-crazy 2019-08-26 19:45:05 Doctor you could glitch yourself in with the build move tool
plane-crazy 2019-08-26 19:44:24 Sounds like you're jealous of the Arctic Facility
plane-crazy 2019-08-26 15:31:37 I've got mixed answers ranging from damaged harddrive to software update
plane-crazy 2019-08-26 15:30:35 Like figuring out why I had an orange screen of death with a stop code "Unexpected Store Exception"
plane-crazy 2019-08-26 15:30:15 Anyway I've got more important things to do
plane-crazy 2019-08-26 15:29:54 I might but I don't know the command
plane-crazy 2019-08-26 15:29:14 Nobody's stopping you right?
plane-crazy 2019-08-26 15:29:06 Suggest it then?
plane-crazy 2019-08-26 15:28:34 And this morning my laptop just did an orange BSOD
plane-crazy 2019-08-26 15:27:19 I hate killboxes
plane-crazy 2019-08-26 15:26:19 Yeah... although I don't want my missiles to passively suck all my fuel after they exploded
plane-crazy 2019-08-26 15:25:28 But if you disconnect a fuel tank from the main build which still has fuel, it should influence the overall fuel capacity
plane-crazy 2019-08-26 15:24:27 Is when they're empty, they become dead weight
plane-crazy 2019-08-26 15:24:03 Yes?
plane-crazy 2019-08-26 15:22:59 Anyone think that fuel drop tanks are impossible ingame cos fuel somehow magically teleports to your engines from several miles away?
plane-crazy 2019-08-26 10:03:18 What's with scam bots in the game? They should know that it's been going on for several years and it's obviously not going to work now
plane-crazy 2019-08-04 13:07:10 It works the same as following
plane-crazy 2019-08-04 13:06:46 use that
plane-crazy 2019-08-04 13:06:27 There's a teleporter in settings for that
plane-crazy 2019-08-04 13:05:58 I had a similar thing when I tried to take a shortcut to pvp instead of going to the original game first
plane-crazy 2019-08-04 13:05:15 you tried to play on the fake gameplace?
plane-crazy 2019-08-04 12:56:01 Probably just a fluke
plane-crazy 2019-08-04 12:55:40 Ye
plane-crazy 2019-08-04 12:55:34 hol' up
plane-crazy 2019-08-04 12:55:03 Look at the likes counter
plane-crazy 2019-08-04 12:54:13 Those upcoming boat paddles are gonna challenge my steamboat's paddles which allow it to accelerate up to 120 spd
plane-crazy 2019-08-02 09:19:20 Where does it go?
plane-crazy 2019-08-02 09:19:15 It's a meme
plane-crazy 2019-08-02 09:15:28 I'll have to redesign it so it can fit 2 motor-driven propellers then http://prntscr.com/ondihy
plane-crazy 2019-08-02 09:13:36 My small monoplane is struggling to stay above the critical angle of attack
plane-crazy 2019-08-02 09:12:27 Historically speaking with the way biplanes are designed
plane-crazy 2019-08-02 09:10:05 Anyone else think that the jet and propeller engines are quite underpowered, especially with a pair of them
plane-crazy 2019-08-02 08:43:58 A base that gets flooded?
plane-crazy 2019-08-02 08:42:36 Oh right...
plane-crazy 2019-08-02 08:42:02 When it should have been invisible
plane-crazy 2019-08-02 08:41:53 In fact when I was parachuting down to the ground, it keeps trying to render the ground from 2800m
plane-crazy 2019-08-02 08:41:30 For some god-forsaken reason, graphics 1 does not mean render distance is set to minimal
plane-crazy 2019-08-02 08:41:08 Yeah
plane-crazy 2019-08-02 08:39:50 Would be nice if roblox can allow us to change render distances without beefing up the detail
plane-crazy 2019-08-01 20:26:48 15 mb
plane-crazy 2019-08-01 20:26:41 Oh boy...
plane-crazy 2019-08-01 20:25:24 How does one design a rocket-propelled bomb?
plane-crazy 2019-08-01 12:49:17 memes stay in the dump lads
plane-crazy 2019-08-01 12:47:20 Suspension stiffness was rated at 5
plane-crazy 2019-08-01 12:46:47 But only *slightly*
plane-crazy 2019-08-01 12:46:32 Myth confirmed: Empty fuel tanks weigh less than being full
http://prntscr.com/omz8lg
plane-crazy 2019-07-03 22:25:09 Enabling outlines help you build without being blinded
plane-crazy 2019-07-03 22:24:47 i don't get why people want outlines disabled
plane-crazy 2019-05-27 20:27:49 Ladders take a long time to build and aren't practical on builds that require constant changing
plane-crazy 2019-05-27 20:27:15 So you're saying that I have to *buy* something to gain that similar accessibility?
plane-crazy 2019-05-27 20:26:54 ...I've been using the ragdoll glitch for ages so I can get on top of my aircraft
plane-crazy 2019-05-27 20:25:07 ..You've had me dead to rights
plane-crazy 2019-05-27 20:24:32 *Who needs the jetpack when you can fly?*
