creations-chat 2020-03-30 01:14:46 SO it has been decided that the basic of the basic shall be used (non rendered sadly) while I am currently working on getting the watermark brightened in the bottom left hand corner. This here is the final product as of now, it has taken of total 5 hours and 26 minutes. (drafting,rough drafts,decisions etc.) and has been finished thanks due to the help of <@!409676438682206218> and you guys!I was hoping to add more but I feel that adding more may make it loose some of its atmosphere and it is open to editing for a thumbnail if it must be. Photoshop the hell out of it and thank you guys for making this possible!

creations-chat 2020-03-30 12:41:33 for all of you curious as too what the man was building in the picture this is the final product of the small but artistic get around VTOL being incredibly nimble and very deadly in battle but yet very stable as well as a great stunt plane.It has a top speed of 315 speed and and take a direct vertical climb at 130 speed.It can stop in 3.5 seconds from 315 speed  and land vertically and horizontally (yes I didn't get that wrong it can land on its nose)

creations-chat 2020-03-30 14:11:33 
creations-chat 2020-03-30 14:11:34 One of my most prideful VTOLs/creations,The Armageddon flying VTOL fortress is a giant super armored VTOL for fighting those spawn killing noobs and small planes.It is stupid effective for ground support and ship battles but not the best with air to air combat.It is fast for its size and requires more than 20 large rocket engines and 8 super rocket engines to propel it off the ground.Its fully equipped with 5 turrents (including rear turrent) 2 being 6 missile turrents, 1 being close range fireworks, the final one being a hell raining bullet sprayer that just rains bullets and the rear being a 2 missile attack turrent.It has 6, 3 dynamite bombs as well.

The giant craft can handle upwards of 12 missile strikes to every part as long as it has its wings, if 6 of the 20+ engines on one side are destroyed thrusters on the opposing side can help to support it.It can easily stabilize even after being heavily struck and missing massive chunks of the cabin and cargo hold. In the case that one wing is blown off or an engine is destroyed completely then I can blow off both engines to cruise down safely and land. It can hover so well mid flight that the craft can be walked around mid hover for any reason in any condition (as long as the 6 engine rule isn't broken) It can easily go into flight mode and the engines turn forward taking it too a top speed of upwards of 275 speed.Its incredibly thicc and heavy but has only 2067 parts making it better for cheaper computers to handle without causing enormous lag spikes (lag matters in fights) don't let its appearance fool you for its competence,resilience and maneuverability.

Note: This this can take a 90 degree vertical straight up incline without a problem taking it to very high heights

Okay basically if you don't want to read it all its a huge flying armored VTOL fortress.
