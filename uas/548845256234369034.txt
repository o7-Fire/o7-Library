creations-chat 2020-11-17 14:52:52 what the hell
creations-chat 2020-11-17 14:56:39 it's shit it's worse than my car that got 90 or more upvotes SMALL DETAILS WHERE THE HELL ARE THEY
creations-chat 2020-11-17 15:00:02 it's more shit than this that i and my friend made (front is so shit you don't even want to see it)
creations-chat 2020-11-17 15:01:32 are you guys mentally disabled or what? how does it look so good to you? that is arguably the worst car I have seen
creations-chat 2020-11-17 15:20:05 my feedback is : delete it, it is horrible reasonable standards are wayy higher than that
creations-chat 2020-11-17 15:21:55 > it's almost like people have to start out with less skills and build them over time
<@!673397945764151336> 50 fucking upvotes, are you dumb? that deserves 50 downvotes, I wouldn't care if it didn't have 50 upvotes. I would just ignore it and pass it off as a *regular car*<@!673397945764151336> so our opinions don't matter?
creations-chat 2020-11-17 15:23:26 > 
> <@456226577798135808> it helps A LOT to get other people's opinion to improve
> <@!519320539538522116> only when someone with actual skill helps you, not people with designer 3 and under
creations-chat 2020-11-17 15:25:50 > <@!548845256234369034> depends how bad your are, if you are like me even people who don't have special pixels next to their name can help me improve my build
<@!519320539538522116> someone that is dogshit at building (the guy with the horrible ford gt) wouldn't help you, someone that is mediocre (like me) would actually be able to help
creations-chat 2020-11-17 15:27:44 it doesn't deserve 50 fucking upvotes though, the build is horrible
creations-chat 2020-11-17 15:29:42 they do
creations-chat 2020-11-17 15:32:11 this was a "good" build at the time i posted it, it's pretty bad right now. It got 44 upvotes which is reasonable I'd say.

creations-chat 2020-11-17 15:39:30 > But your criticism should be constructive and reasonably detailed
<@!519320539538522116> if the build is two blocks and gets over 100 upvotes and is not a "joke build" according to the person who posted it, how should you give constructive criticism?
