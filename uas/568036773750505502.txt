creations-chat 2021-07-19 03:16:17 Personally if anyone can make a gyro stabalizer, I will be happy :>
creations-chat 2021-07-19 03:20:04 I mean like I think it’s possible with hover thrusters and motors and stuff, it’s jus gonna be weird cause like I can think how to do the pitch part so it stays flat, but rn can’t think of ways to do the roll rn,       Edit: I mean it’s similar to the way you jus do the pitch so I jus thought of how to do it, so am gonna try it rn
creations-chat 2021-07-19 03:47:36 ok some progress on that gyro, I have made the roll adjuster, now jus gotta make the pitch adjuster
creations-chat 2021-07-19 04:19:56 my brain left the chat reading that

creations-chat 2022-12-05 19:36:03 can anyone tell me whats wrong with my build like im being left in the dark it would be nice to know
creations-chat 2022-12-05 19:38:26 need to be lvl 3
creations-chat 2022-12-05 19:46:07 thats why i put mini, like its a mini build for a reason, but it does look like it wym?
creations-chat 2022-12-05 19:49:14 fair i see what u mean by the f-35 it does look more like it tbh, but sheesh hard critiism (also there is motorlock)
creations-chat 2022-12-05 19:53:23 yea i can understand that but jus saying it will take eons to get good, like u could be a bit supportive instead of being mean (ik its not u who said it but still, u could give advice etc) like i do take critism and what i could to make it better but still its not advice when ur jus saying that a person is crap
creations-chat 2022-12-05 19:56:06 couldn't of said it better, suggestions rather than statements
creations-chat 2022-12-05 19:58:07 fr worse player consideration than nintendo (and we all know how much they care about their players)

replying to comment below: yea but how, what are some things u would think i could do to improve
creations-chat 2022-12-05 20:00:52 ^
creations-chat 2022-12-05 20:03:39 this is what im talking about and thanks for the good advice imma go try and see if I can implement those things now :)
creations-chat 2022-12-05 20:09:43 already fixed one of the exposed motorlocks with springs cause i totally didnt know about them until 2 weeks ago x.x
creations-chat 2022-12-05 22:19:17 based
creations-chat 2022-12-05 22:22:42 then why is there other wip in that channel? also i could jus remove the wip n say its jus the turret i wanted to make cause that was the original thing
creations-chat 2022-12-06 12:34:07 Another based build
creations-chat 2022-12-06 16:06:18 Your the one in the friend group who only messages once every month to say hi then when u hang out say that u “needed it”
creations-chat 2022-12-06 16:09:24 Make a mini build but with the wrong paint job since I modded an old build
creations-chat 2022-12-06 16:28:05 bro got called out 💀 damn bro didnt mean to hit a bad memory
creations-chat 2022-12-06 16:39:00 then why u here still talking... like if u had better things to do who cares about what goes on here (also np bro :> dont take this stuff seriously enough to care either)
creations-chat 2022-12-06 16:46:41 also fr jus double looking at my plane it does not look like the su-75 at all im actually so confused tryna figure out what this is lmao

edit: figured it out, its su-57 (jus repainting now no idea how I didnt realise sooner x.x 🤣) 

~~edit 2: scrap that~~
creations-chat 2022-12-06 16:51:45 im so confused, is this a su-57 or su-75 im tryna find out but nothing is helping
creations-chat 2022-12-06 16:54:20 so what I have seemed to have made is a combo of the 57 and 75, wild lmao (single engined 57 basically)
creations-chat 2022-12-06 16:57:00 the elevators are the back wings (which I though was how it was) [if not ill fix it rn)
creations-chat 2022-12-06 17:02:51 https://streamable.com/v3qooh
creations-chat 2022-12-06 17:05:08 ? (elaborate Im on not much sleep rn)
creations-chat 2022-12-06 18:17:24 its a combine we alr figured out, su 57 + su 75
creations-chat 2022-12-06 18:19:49 only jus reached t3?
creations-chat 2022-12-06 18:45:17 how many times do I have to say we've already sorted it
creations-chat 2022-12-06 22:44:43 looks like n F4

creations-chat 2022-12-06 23:13:15 U joined 2 months ago <:tr:951592944752820264>
creations-chat 2022-12-06 23:15:19 I have 5 <:tro:840399331354083408>
creations-chat 2022-12-06 23:17:37 2019
creations-chat 2022-12-06 23:19:43 I cannot even process this lmao
creations-chat 2022-12-07 00:26:08 Ok then keep seething I do not care about your opinion, I’m making it how I want too
creations-chat 2022-12-07 00:28:11 I will gladly thanks :) I mean I put in the desc how much people hate it when I upload that build lmao
creations-chat 2022-12-07 10:39:02 <@456226577798135808> Are those wing panels? cause I cannot imagine the drag it will cause
creations-chat 2022-12-07 10:41:07 jeez ur gonna need a decent chunk of engines to get that goin, also <a:nerdglasses:1026297220112318475> <@748539835484078130>
creations-chat 2022-12-07 15:22:22 Fr this community very bias and mostly rude with the few exceptions, I post my build in creations to get flak from people who are only on here to shit on builds and never actually say smth good
creations-chat 2022-12-07 15:25:35 The scale is purposely small I’m not trying to make a Goliath 1.5k-3k build, I’m tryna make sub 600-700 builds that are compact, also I know the maus is off scale but that one I’m too lazy to fix since it was such a pain, the others though are relatively to scale (that’s if you ofcourse made them smaller)
creations-chat 2022-12-07 15:30:17 If u gimme like 5 mins I can show u the unlocked vers but it’s completely custom.       Also I jus ignore the downvotes no since they are demotivating fuck
creations-chat 2022-12-07 15:36:03 Tbh same but is also nice seeing cool builds n that now tho they were fun, goofing around with treads n stuff or makin the wacky botes
creations-chat 2022-12-07 15:50:11 Proof the F-14 isnt tut: https://streamable.com/k4mltr
creations-chat 2022-12-07 15:56:30 make one urself then
creations-chat 2022-12-07 15:58:53 same lmao, cant have shit without shit takes following
creations-chat 2022-12-07 16:01:58 fr, also mods be treating ppl like shit too so cant do anything abt it when they encourage it
creations-chat 2022-12-07 16:08:01 if a build is bad and all you do is shit on it then the person wont improve, nor will the build. All you achieve is detering the player from playing the game, if the builder thinks it looks like its accurate but its not then correct them dont jus say "shit build get better"
creations-chat 2022-12-07 16:11:07 nah jus classic PCC argument cause of stuck up 14 yr olds thinking its life or death if u put something half a block wrong
creations-chat 2022-12-07 22:15:14 ill try its quite hard alr to get it to lock into right postion, also thanks for the compliment ur prolly the first on this discord who has actually said smth nice about it instead of saying smth bad about it only :)
creations-chat 2022-12-07 22:40:46 he must be clinically insane
creations-chat 2022-12-07 22:42:56 you poor poor soul I cannot imagine how long that must've took
creations-chat 2022-12-07 22:45:40 how long we talkin
creations-chat 2022-12-07 22:49:26 Jesus I jus make a build on one session for like half a day and tweak over time but weeks, that’s mental
creations-chat 2022-12-07 22:53:53 I mean I think the most time I’ve spent on builds is around 40 hours give or take a few for some but on mobile I jus can’t imagine doing it for sges
creations-chat 2022-12-07 23:00:28 Oh same most of mine are mid but I have been getting way better recently I’ve been playing since 2019 but have only like 20 days total playtime over the 3-4ish years lmao
creations-chat 2022-12-08 00:15:48 Lmao, over engineered shredder
creations-chat 2023-01-07 23:08:44 idk if i should be happy or annoyed at this but its a good outcome either way
creations-chat 2023-01-07 23:29:31 like this..
creations-chat 2023-01-07 23:31:33 if im being honest idek what roscale means i jus assume its small scale
creations-chat 2023-01-07 23:33:47 fixed, i do have a roscale a-10 tho if u search up my name with images it will appear
creations-chat 2023-01-07 23:37:08 bold of you to think that im not
creations-chat 2023-01-08 00:16:10 aint talkin bout that
creations-chat 2023-01-08 00:22:54 im talking about the speechbubble smartass
