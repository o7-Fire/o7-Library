help 2021-10-05 17:23:49 since the landing gear we have rn in pc1 is bouncy when you land i was thinking maybe they'd add suspension to the landing gear in pc2?
help 2021-10-05 17:27:01 i know you can put suspensions on the landing gear or make custom landing gear but having landing gear in pc2 with suspension can save some of your space

basically gonna be the length of an entire plot
creations-chat 2022-07-06 08:59:10 what?
creations-chat 2022-07-06 09:50:20 how?
creations-chat 2022-07-06 09:52:31 the only problems i see is that the 2 engines should be further out to the side and they are kinda rough on the sides
creations-chat 2022-07-09 20:57:07 looks kinda  nice
however you should probably make those signs a lighter color or something... not lighter than the body
creations-chat 2022-08-06 21:19:34 dont ask why i posted a trolley in <#384025409945337856>
i just posted it for some reason
creations-chat 2022-08-06 21:22:03 i told you not to ask about it. but you did
why did you ask
creations-chat 2022-08-08 16:46:21 anyone know how i can make motors stronger?
creations-chat 2022-08-08 16:48:37 im tryna make a bomb bay but the doors usually get stuck (the motors are at maximum torque)
creations-chat 2022-08-08 16:55:47 fixed
creations-chat 2022-08-08 17:03:53 the doors on my bomber still get stuck. even after making some parts ice

help 2022-09-01 14:05:02 hold on
help 2022-09-01 14:07:27 also i cant  add more control surfaces
creations-chat 2022-09-01 16:46:26 hmm... is it just me or does it seem like the creation is very underrated?
creations-chat 2022-09-01 16:50:11 i dont doubt that at all
creations-chat 2022-09-01 16:55:11 yeah for some reason
unless it looks good
but even sometimes when it looks amazing it gets like a lot of downvotes for some strange reason
creations-chat 2022-09-01 16:57:17 yup .-.
creations-chat 2022-09-01 17:11:46 xd
creations-chat 2022-09-01 17:14:17 its not the shaders
i just think the jet looks nice
creations-chat 2022-09-01 17:20:39 i think its because the creations blacklist means you cant post a creation in <#384025409945337856>
creations-chat 2022-09-01 17:42:23 okay that is actually true
creations-chat 2022-09-02 06:59:02 anything i should change on my custom ACE?
creations-chat 2022-09-02 07:01:34 not sure how ill make better landing gears or vertical stabilizers for it but ill try
creations-chat 2022-09-02 07:21:37 vertical stabilizers fixed i think
and same for the guns
creations-chat 2022-09-02 07:57:56 why doesnt my posts in <#384025409945337856> get any upvotes or downvotes sometimes?
bug-reports 2022-09-02 09:07:15 i think hyperbot crashed
posts in <#384025409945337856> dont get any votes
creations-chat 2022-09-02 20:07:27 anyone know what ww2 inspired ACE aircraft i should make?
help 2022-09-02 20:17:13 for some reason whenever i upvote/downvote a creation in <#384025409945337856> i automatically undo the vote i made
help 2022-09-02 20:17:18 idk why
creations-chat 2022-09-02 20:53:52 seems like some people arent so happy about how my plane looks... what else should i change on it?
creations-chat 2022-09-02 20:56:22 true i guess
creations-chat 2022-09-02 20:59:45 and im not sure how im supposed to change literally everything on my plane
creations-chat 2022-09-02 21:03:35 well i wasnt gonna remake it, i just wanted to know what i could change, but that doesnt mean litteraly everything
creations-chat 2022-09-03 11:19:02 seriously what do i change on my plane? im not gonna change the whole aircraft if thats what you guys want
creations-chat 2022-09-03 13:08:29 good idea! not sure how the hell ill do it tho
bug-reports 2022-09-17 17:09:41 i would be very glad if i had the ability to open my locked trap doors but that probably wont happen : (
bug-reports 2022-09-17 17:42:10 well i made a giant wall that you can only get past by jetpack, going past the wall (meaning driving on grass) or by aircraft
bug-reports 2022-09-17 17:42:20 and to make the wall i needed to use motor lock fold
creations-chat 2022-09-18 09:22:26 so uhh... i wanna make a border thing in plane crazy but i think the walls are lacking a TON of details... anyone know what i can add on the walls or at the walls? (also dont ask why i made it)
creations-chat 2022-09-18 09:34:17 well its supposed to be based in 1950 but okay... also i already have 2 guard towers on both ends of the wall
creations-chat 2022-09-18 09:45:32 alright ill try
creations-chat 2022-09-18 09:49:51 also how do i add grass...
creations-chat 2022-09-18 09:59:40 i guess you can add small screens? so people know when the next train is coming and all that stuff (using text but idk if you even have space .-.)
creations-chat 2022-09-18 10:18:16 but how am i supposed to add grass to the wall?
creations-chat 2022-09-18 10:29:09 yes but how am i supposed to add grass in such a narrow area?
