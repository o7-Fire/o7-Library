help 2022-01-28 19:01:11 great
help 2022-01-28 19:01:44 but i kinda worried about if it works on terrain
help 2022-01-28 19:01:48 i mean offroad
help 2022-01-28 19:03:00 this was what i expected,but mini tanks also have advantages for pvp
help 2022-01-28 19:03:29 they are fast and if u put some explosive block armor,it be unstoppable (literally)
help 2022-01-28 19:03:59 also does this F-16c look good
help 2022-01-28 19:04:41 why?
help 2022-01-28 19:05:22 what should i add/change (this is a 189 blocks mini build so dont think it can be more detailed)
help 2022-01-28 19:05:49 and has the top speed of 1900
help 2022-01-28 19:07:19 yes but i said its a mini build,if you want a cylinder copy like the real one the motorlocks will go outside the body
help 2022-01-28 19:07:35 u can see there is no more space to motorlocks,look at inside the canopy
help 2022-01-28 19:08:27 yes now u are right
bug-reports 2022-05-01 16:46:49 Hi.Im a plane crazy player literally for 4 years but for last year,I got a problem that still never fixed.My plane crazy data is somehow  broken and I can't use my pvp rockets while moving/flying.That made me to stop using pvp mode and I start getting bored.I just want to ask the developers:Can you fix my problem?I would be really happy if it gets fixed. Greetings.
bug-reports 2022-05-01 16:47:47 I tried both
bug-reports 2022-05-01 16:47:51 nothing changed
bug-reports 2022-05-01 16:48:04 that happening me for second time
bug-reports 2022-05-01 16:48:23 2 years ago that happened again but it get solved after the "data fixed" update
bug-reports 2022-05-01 16:48:31 so I can say its because of data
bug-reports 2022-05-01 20:57:45 but it got fixed when it happened for first time
bug-reports 2022-05-01 20:58:04 now its just happening for 2nd time long time later
bug-reports 2022-05-01 20:58:11 so its

bug-reports 2022-08-05 08:56:11 guys when I spawn a big ship and save it,next time I open the save the build doesnt load correctly
bug-reports 2022-08-05 08:56:16 I mean some blocks missing
bug-reports 2022-08-05 08:56:37 like that
bug-reports 2022-08-05 09:01:45 so I had to wait more?
bug-reports 2022-08-10 13:39:23 my ship's blocks randomly gets deleted everytime I leave and join the game after saving (and I wait like 5 minutes to be sure that I won't leave before save gets completed.).Also that doesn't happen on my other builds.Please help I don't want to remake 100 blocks of the ship.
bug-reports 2022-08-10 13:39:40 as you can see from the helipad and missing motorlock parts
bug-reports 2022-08-10 18:06:40 that is the saved one
bug-reports 2022-08-10 18:06:59 and yes the autosaved one has also deleted blocks
bug-reports 2022-08-10 18:07:36 but not on helipad,on motorlock tower
bug-reports 2022-08-10 18:08:14 like how many days ago?
bug-reports 2022-08-10 18:08:35 if its like a few days ago,then might be good news for m
bug-reports 2022-08-10 18:08:38 e
bug-reports 2022-08-10 18:08:47 mines is like a week,maybe even 5 days
bug-reports 2022-08-10 18:09:33 also how did you solved it?
bug-reports 2022-08-10 18:09:43 did it fix itself or something else?
bug-reports 2022-08-10 18:09:52 k
bug-reports 2022-08-10 18:09:55 thanks
bug-reports 2022-08-10 18:10:27 you gave me some hope that i wont back out from plane crazy completely
bug-reports 2022-08-10 18:10:36 yes,
bug-reports 2022-08-10 18:59:48 I saved it already
bug-reports 2022-08-10 19:00:01 and both autosave and normal save have deleted blovks
bug-reports 2022-08-10 19:00:04 bocks*
bug-reports 2022-08-10 19:00:06 blocks*
bug-reports 2022-08-10 19:00:44 its a vip server,do i still need
bug-reports 2022-08-10 19:01:44 ok
bug-reports 2022-08-10 19:02:12 ok,also thanks for your info already
bug-reports 2022-08-10 19:02:33 no
bug-reports 2022-08-10 19:03:40 but there might be something different about it,i wanna say but I don't think I should say it at this channel,can I DM you?
bug-reports 2022-08-22 18:58:44 should it fix if i save to other slot?
bug-reports 2022-11-13 20:41:18 whenever the motorlock/piston lock of my tank gets destroyed,my game crashes (and not even a big part of motorlock like 2 small piston locks).Here is footage of my motorlock tower to make you realize the amount of them
bug-reports 2022-11-13 21:04:37 known? I couldn't find anything written about it
creations-chat 2022-11-18 11:22:55 just wanted to build a circular nose,why does it look like that
creations-chat 2022-11-18 11:39:36 yes,i was a 1 block-wide builder. So what should i use and how should it look like in build mode
creations-chat 2022-11-18 12:27:42 btw does it make the plane bad for pvp since so many blocks
bug-reports 2023-06-20 16:00:23 ik that its not the perfect channel to report them but those 2 dumb people have been lagging the server intentionally for literally an hour and they literally caused my game to crash,teleported to the same server and still going on
bug-reports 2023-06-23 14:05:25 solution:10 robux
help 2023-07-12 11:41:16 so back to my 3rd motorlocked jet from roughly a year and two months ago. Tho its 1 block wide seems like it has some pvp potential
help 2023-07-12 11:41:48 i wanna "modernize" it in terms of looks while retaining the performance
help 2023-07-12 11:41:57 any ideas?
help 2023-07-12 12:53:43 well i remember some of them
help 2023-07-12 12:54:13 destroyed my friend's tutorial f22 over 5 times and pretended as if i didnt know it was him
help 2023-07-12 12:54:50 destroyed a few russian destroyers from 80s because they were drinking vodka instead of pure american democracy
help 2023-07-12 12:55:38 and disrespected a namnam style su 35 by pulling cobra in a10
help 2023-07-12 12:55:51 anyway
help 2023-07-12 12:56:01 that thing looks outdated
help 2023-07-12 12:56:09 waiting for ideas
