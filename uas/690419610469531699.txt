creations-chat 2020-10-19 03:51:10 checking up on this feed is like looking through an abandoned facility where something horrifying happened and just finding scraps of information as to what happened

creations-chat 2020-11-05 21:13:09 the verdict is clear...it is ground shredder
creations-chat 2020-11-15 03:31:46 yes, the missile is fully functional
creations-chat 2020-11-15 03:40:35 the missile probably isn't maneuverable enough to recreate that quick turn
creations-chat 2020-11-15 03:51:01 ay, fonnexfoxx we're in the same server
creations-chat 2021-02-21 07:49:09 <@!587393222855229457>* You're not important enough for that information*
creations-chat 2021-02-21 07:59:01 dang it i realized the second dialogue option worked better...but i'm not going to save scum, so take that sergeant arch dornan!

creations-chat 2021-04-02 03:26:13 any feedback on my helicopter? - i was just preparing to scrap it so i reverted to more or less my original design so it'd look its best (this is due to my lacking helicopter knowledge and not being able to make it work no matter what i did), i'm seeing a few downvotes so i think i should explain that it's more of an exploration of potential designs in a world where the axis won world war two.
creations-chat 2021-04-02 03:30:55 if my design (which granted is non-functional, but as i said that wasn't my main intent although i wish it was functional so i'm replacing it with something more functional) was worse than i thought i just want feedback (however harsh) so i can improve future designs
creations-chat 2021-04-02 03:40:04 can i get criticism on my helicopter's design?
creations-chat 2021-04-02 03:54:46 can someone criticize my helicopter?
creations-chat 2021-04-02 03:57:22 very much agreed, it was hard picking angles for it so i kind of just defaulted to the generic side and front right view
creations-chat 2021-04-02 04:01:23 yeah, it's hard to see but it does have a white bottom (just obscured by the airfield) and i did try it with that dark blue and red, but yeah it could use more variation...i am proud of my the colors i came up with though
creations-chat 2021-04-02 04:09:41 is it possible i could receive further criticism, such as the way i introduced the vehicle in it's description or anything else that may not be coming to my mind, i don't really build a whole lot of helicopters (this being the third helicopter i've built since i started to play this game, and second one i am at all happy with)
creations-chat 2021-04-02 04:26:57 can i receive feedback on the way i introduced my helicopter? i have a bigger build in the works getting fairly close to completion and i was wondering whether or not i should do something similar when i finish that and post it
creations-chat 2021-04-02 04:29:31 yeah, i'm aware of some of it's design issues as i already received feedback on that...i was more wondering about the text i put with my images
creations-chat 2021-04-02 04:33:26 gorgeous, can't say what to add since i know nothing about trains but it is a very nice looking train front
creations-chat 2021-04-02 04:35:54 just out of curiosity, how long did that take you?
creations-chat 2021-04-02 04:39:44 dang, i struggle to even work on a single build of mine for more than an hour (part of the reason my current build has lasted almost half a year...but hey, every inch of it is lovingly crafted as a plus)
creations-chat 2021-04-02 04:42:45 ay! relatable!
creations-chat 2022-02-28 06:03:20 i check the creations tab one last time before going to bed and this is what i see...yikes:
