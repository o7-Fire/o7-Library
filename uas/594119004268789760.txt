creations-chat 2021-11-13 19:04:01 Well bigger are better 100% for things you mentioned, but the thing is - they are easier targets and I wanted to make mine lighter and faster.

I will remodel it to a bigger one Sunday

creations-chat 2022-05-04 17:16:35 ? I am back in this server after like half a year
creations-chat 2022-05-04 17:18:20 Like what did I do wrong? I just posted an image of a build I made. Like others are allowed too, so idk why I can't do it
creations-chat 2022-05-04 17:21:30 Just because it looks bad? It is my first that kind of plane smh. Why are all of you so toxic instead of helping or something?
creations-chat 2022-05-04 17:27:05 This is quite good *compared* to the builds I see in public servers(kids or very new players I suppose). Now I understand why others called this server toxic :/. Like when I first joined - people wrote suggestions or tried to help me build something instead of calling it goofy or cancerous. I know that it is not good,(not talking about what others make) but it is my first of that kind(and with no motorlock or other stuff).

Edit - well it is not a very good pvp plane, but can work as one, or at least was trying to build that
creations-chat 2022-05-04 17:29:52 Umm I wrote that my build is not good, but at least I could get help or something instead of just being toxic. Maybe I wrote that wrong, but still
Edit - yes, I did. I thought that it will stop after your message, but I was wrong.
creations-chat 2022-05-04 17:33:03 The thing is - I don't care about upvotes, I just posted it so I can get help(well I kinda got, but still) and just for fun. It is building game after all
Edit - <@757760986848559256> smart? English is my 2nd language and I am trying to seem as understandable as posssible.
creations-chat 2022-05-04 17:35:01 As I wrote - I might have wrote that wrong and not as I intended while thinking about this stuff
Edit - <@683847069890510887> Exactly, that is why I needed help to make something better,(which I wrote several times) but I was wrong
creations-chat 2022-05-04 17:40:46 Well just calling it shit and goofy without normal tips to at least make it better is not very good feedback in my opinion
Edit - well finally I got some help(acttualy 2nd time).
creations-chat 2022-05-04 17:43:48 Umm I think that rockets should be exposed like in real life(I am not talking about how ugly it looks, but the idea of it)
creations-chat 2022-05-04 17:45:40 Well I tried to make delta wings
creations-chat 2022-05-04 17:50:42 What about this?
creations-chat 2022-05-04 17:54:10 Sure, should I  place coloured block or something?
creations-chat 2022-05-04 17:56:02 
creations-chat 2022-05-04 17:58:35 <@685909594932773033> üëç , I will build new things after some time and will see how much this will help - thanks!
