help 2021-08-31 04:19:12 Remove the part that folds and then rebuild it but pointing up and then have the motor join the main wing and the folding 0art together at either the back, front or middle of the fold line
help 2021-08-31 04:19:29 And make sure the motor can fold the wing tip
help 2021-08-31 04:23:00 Also have something that prevents the wing tip from folding too much too

the-dump 2021-09-01 05:14:30 Took picture of Ikea toilet back in 2019
the-dump 2021-09-01 05:15:24 My shoe is in the picture
the-dump 2021-09-01 05:15:45 I took a selfie in the bathtub too
the-dump 2021-09-01 05:15:54 I don't have the selfie tho
the-dump 2021-09-01 05:15:59 I deleted it
the-dump 2021-09-01 05:16:25 I have these tho
the-dump 2021-09-01 05:17:02 
the-dump 2021-09-01 05:17:12 Absolutely cursed image
the-dump 2021-09-01 05:17:20 That's from a few weeks ago
the-dump 2021-09-01 05:17:37 I found a picture of the bathtub tho
the-dump 2021-09-01 05:18:02 
the-dump 2021-09-01 05:19:03 On an Xbox 360 with a PS1 controller or something and a HP keyboard and monitor
the-dump 2021-09-01 05:19:33 Almost all of those shouldn't be there together
the-dump 2021-09-01 05:19:40 The monitor could be
the-dump 2021-09-01 05:20:56 Never too old to troll
the-dump 2021-09-01 05:23:00 Bite in the arse
the-dump 2021-09-01 05:31:43 Nokia case
the-dump 2021-09-01 05:32:15 I didn't even get to hear what it said
the-dump 2021-09-01 05:32:22 My sound is muted
the-dump 2021-09-01 05:33:02 Halal anime
the-dump 2021-09-01 05:34:01 What was the sound tho
the-dump 2021-09-01 05:36:07 DM the video I'm curious about what the audio was but I'll have to listen later
the-dump 2021-09-01 05:37:15 That's my aim
the-dump 2021-09-01 05:38:01 Idk I still have volume muted so idk
the-dump 2021-09-01 05:41:49 Thought it's just me but I guess it's all of discord (took 2 or 3 resends to send that)
the-dump 2021-09-01 05:43:13 Discord has gone oof again
the-dump 2021-09-01 05:43:24 Like usual
the-dump 2021-09-01 05:43:32 Oh I think it's fixed
the-dump 2021-09-01 05:44:08 Back on the wheel thing
the-dump 2021-09-01 05:44:20 Generating power for the servers
the-dump 2021-09-01 05:44:35 Probably was a shift change
the-dump 2021-09-01 05:44:55 Evening shift hamster left and night shift Hampstead came
the-dump 2021-09-01 05:45:04 But night shift hamster was late
the-dump 2021-09-01 05:46:28 If both hamsters run then power overload and discord becomes dwascord
the-dump 2021-09-01 05:46:44 Simple
the-dump 2021-09-01 16:28:12 right its cursed
the-dump 2021-09-01 22:45:17 Downloaded it and looked at it all frame by frame
the-dump 2021-09-01 22:46:09 Most worrying part is that some of the even most random stuff I've done before
the-dump 2021-09-01 22:46:32 
the-dump 2021-09-01 22:46:57 Right how many days have I been doing that for
the-dump 2021-09-01 22:47:05 I lost count
the-dump 2021-09-01 22:47:18 
the-dump 2021-09-01 22:47:25 Uranium
the-dump 2021-09-02 03:07:48 Yes that seems to happen sometimes
the-dump 2021-09-02 03:08:51 Literally when physics is like
the-dump 2021-09-02 03:09:02 Physics.exe has stopped working
the-dump 2021-09-02 03:09:21 And then the build just goes plop
the-dump 2021-09-02 03:09:32 Or plop at really high speed
the-dump 2021-09-02 03:09:44 Just depends how fast it was going before
the-dump 2021-09-02 04:52:47 As they have stated they are still proud of the moment so I guess they found a way or just searched the words in the discord search thing
the-dump 2021-09-02 18:33:40 More than 2 years ago
the-dump 2021-09-02 18:34:40 Nearly 3 years
the-dump 2021-09-02 18:42:56 
the-dump 2021-09-02 18:43:02 Ultimate faceoff
the-dump 2021-09-02 19:29:36 It's gold I think
the-dump 2021-09-03 04:57:07 OwO
