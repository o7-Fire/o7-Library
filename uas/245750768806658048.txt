the-dump 2020-12-15 18:05:31 funtime drake what the frick!
creations-chat 2022-07-05 09:19:57 wait nvm what do you mean
creations-chat 2022-07-05 09:23:38 it does use some basic motorlock but it does reach the height limit due to its wingspan. i still made the damn thing though it took days. granted i did build it around early 2020 so its been sitting in my saves
creations-chat 2022-07-05 09:28:36 idk my building has always been pretty shotty but motorlock is used in alot of the rest of my stuff because i ususally build small. but since this is big it uses like i think 4 actual locking motors. all the others rotate the pannels to make it nice and smooth
creations-chat 2022-07-05 09:32:47 damn dude thats better than my ornithopter i never finished. it creates the same motion in a space thats way more compact. i hope it doestn bug out as much as mine
creations-chat 2022-07-05 09:35:07 plus yours seems to work as intended too whereas mine acts more like a glider somehow.
