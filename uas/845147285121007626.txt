creations-chat 2022-07-23 05:03:05 i mean its not bad its goofy
creations-chat 2022-07-23 05:07:34 yes i understand my plane is absolutely garbage but that boat does not need in the hundreds of upvotes, its good i mean its a boat you cant go wrong. but in every creations i see not that bad jets getting absolutely clowned on for like 3 blocks while that boat is absolutely fine but im not mad at it being upvoted im mad about the insanity of the creations channel
help 2022-07-23 05:23:14 what do plane builders mean by 1 wides? do they mean the cockpit or the entire plane
help 2022-07-23 05:24:24 wouldnt the cockpit not be centred then?
help 2022-07-23 05:24:34 also why would people want that
help 2022-07-23 05:25:21 fair point

help 2022-07-23 05:40:41 im not sure how it apply's to plane building but i understand the main part
help 2022-07-23 05:45:26 im tryna get my plane to look as realistic as possible but its hard when i have barely used motorlocks yet + i will try with my next plane (because they look really goofy rn)
help 2022-07-23 05:46:45 yeah but thats the problem with actual jets because they are mostly solid color except a few stickers

help 2022-08-04 03:41:14 is the landing gear motorlocked (like is there a block half way through that would make the wheel go into a block?)
creations-chat 2022-08-04 03:43:28 canadian busses are goofy
help 2022-08-04 03:44:16 yes but is there a moving block (landing gear) in a non moving block
help 2022-08-04 03:45:56 thats probably why, save the build and delete the block then try it, if it doesnt work then im wrong but if it does work then there is the fix to your problem.
help 2022-08-04 03:47:19 did it work?
help 2022-08-04 03:47:45 O_O
creations-chat 2022-08-04 04:21:23 its not even motor locked O_O

creations-chat 2022-08-06 04:40:11 bro what is that üíÄ
creations-chat 2022-08-06 04:44:23 i mean it would work but if your mig isnt WASD then when you try to aim the missile the plane will follow the missile (wouldn't you just follow the bomb because it has the same controls as plane?+ if you miss you gotta steer and not crash the plane and the bomb)
creations-chat 2022-08-06 04:47:04 building massive ships is pain (im tryna make a large battleship and im now trying to fold upwards) are upward folds even possible? (this was edit part)
creations-chat 2022-08-06 04:49:55 oml i just checked the about me is absolutely goofy üíÄ
help 2022-08-06 04:50:53 with building big ships is it possible to fold upward?
creations-chat 2022-08-06 04:54:26 i hope that its a joke and if its not they are the most goofy person alive (also what is that plane üíÄ
creations-chat 2022-08-06 04:56:39 but memes are meant to be funny O_o (and not concerning)
creations-chat 2022-08-06 04:59:20 +its slightly disturbing
creations-chat 2022-08-06 05:08:56 how 2 fold upwards
creations-chat 2022-08-06 05:14:37 okie dokie
creations-chat 2022-08-06 05:16:39 oh naw you cant talk
creations-chat 2022-08-06 05:19:47 ooooohhhhhhhh (thanks!)
creations-chat 2022-08-06 05:22:32 idk if it would be rude to ask but im planning on making a large battle ship, do you have any tips on making massive ships?
creations-chat 2022-08-06 05:24:46 k (thanks for helping)
creations-chat 2022-08-06 05:27:07 that emoji gives me ptsd from annoying people üíÄ
creations-chat 2022-08-06 05:29:08 yes+ someone in a server just posted "ü§ì ‚òùÔ∏è " after every text
help 2022-08-07 02:38:29 is there a good ship i should try to build? ( im tryna learn to make large ships and well idk how)
help 2022-08-07 02:39:53 sure
help 2022-08-07 04:48:31 motor locking is a setting inside the motor settings that says "lock"
if you put 2 locked motors together (stacked) they fuse the blocks attached to them.
if you make a tower of these in different patterns you can make blocks, designs and motors that you cant normally get.
help 2022-08-07 04:50:25 also motorlocks dont need to be used in every build like most boats only use little to no motor locks (its mostly the jets and planes)
help 2022-08-07 04:51:11 O_O
help 2022-08-07 04:54:54 oo i forgot about tanks (its just that motorlocks are only used for details on boats while it makes up half a jet)+ naw im just helping a new player get rid of their skill issue
help 2022-08-07 05:01:23 :(
creations-chat 2022-08-07 05:27:43 only if you're using a jet, boat and tank 1v1's are amazing
creations-chat 2022-08-07 05:30:11 i hate how big jets and planes are in the game, it is in the name but boats and tanks are so much better if you want to actually play the game (pvp tanks r rare sadly but pvp boats are a bit more common)
creations-chat 2022-08-07 05:33:02 fair point but i dislike the sort of obsession the game has with jets, I've seen 3 actual boats and about 200 jets that look half the same
creations-chat 2022-08-07 05:35:49 goofy opinion
help 2022-08-10 02:16:20 is 3x the plot big enough for a furutaka cruiser? (its a thin ship so its only horizontal folds)
creations-chat 2022-08-10 03:11:01 is 3 plot lengths long enough for a furutaka? (cruiser ship and its thin)
creations-chat 2022-08-10 03:51:14 i also want to see the goofy ahh mech
creations-chat 2022-08-10 03:56:31 yes,we all want the goody ahh mech
creations-chat 2022-08-10 04:32:27 i have asked like 80 times what is a normal size for a cruiser ship? (is 3 plots too long??)
creations-chat 2022-08-10 04:35:01 ok thx (im trying to make a furutaka and i dont want the ship to be too small)
creations-chat 2022-08-10 04:40:43 k
creations-chat 2022-08-10 05:08:26 mechs suck for pvp but they look cool
creations-chat 2022-08-10 05:10:59 no? the motors are not fast enough or specific enough to use any weapon unless you strapped missiles to the sides and spammed, a jet or tank can absolutely destroy a mech because they break and are 99% helium blocks and float
creations-chat 2022-08-10 05:15:48 have you ever heard of bombs? or any rockets at all? they are massive targets that cant do 2 things at once, they are useless to any bomber or just about anything that doesnt stand still.
creations-chat 2022-08-10 05:22:10 it is
creations-chat 2022-08-10 05:25:59 its a goofy block game where everyone has awful opinions, this is the most goofy chat in all of discord

help 2022-08-11 03:23:18 how do i stretch it..
creations-chat 2022-08-11 22:15:08 üíÄ
creations-chat 2022-08-11 22:18:09 i think its because its simple and there isnt anything to compare it to, unlike other builds
creations-chat 2022-08-11 22:20:44 i would assume? unless your kidding and it got downvoted to hell  this server votes on what it can be compared to and how hidden the insides are, like how a domino's someone made gets more upvotes than a not half bad looking jet.
creations-chat 2022-08-11 22:22:51 why does the camo look like camo and not spam painting random camo ish colors
help 2022-08-12 02:57:48 üíÄ

creations-chat 2022-08-16 03:24:50 over half the time ro-scale is a 2 block wide motorlocked to death creation that almost doesnt work
creations-chat 2022-08-16 03:27:05 BUT IT LOOKS AWFUL AND TAKES LIKE 2 DAYS TO HIDE THE LOCKS (also its painful to do but it can look good)
creations-chat 2022-08-16 03:36:34 standards are extremely low, there isnt even a jet with 98 downvotes
creations-chat 2022-08-16 03:39:03 ayyyyee the jet with 98 downvotes is finally here
creations-chat 2022-08-16 03:43:03 yep, im surprised you found that. the nose sucks and its mad goofy

help 2022-09-14 03:36:05 make motors with no power and only lock, place it so its facing up then one ontop of it facing down, look up the different towers you can use but motor locking is a way to make things the game didnt have, such as angles not normal to the game or just simple details on a build
help 2022-09-14 03:38:19 this is how it should look and work, its a way to compress and add detail and also buff pvp weapons such as bombs or guns
help 2022-09-15 02:03:23 alotta wedges and smart placement would make a good almost pixel pattern but if you want smooth just suffer and try to angle lock it
creations-chat 2022-09-16 00:39:28 agreed (also yes todays builds have been ass)
creations-chat 2022-09-16 00:41:34 motor lock smooth the front and make it more 3d also un cheese the wings with hollow wings and trapdoors, also attempt to motor lock some smaller details

help 2022-09-16 02:44:05 well yeah but if its meant to be a force field im thinking it opens real quick or in a area then closes fast
help 2022-09-16 02:48:36 i would say a smaller full version, if its too large then the force field is useless
creations-chat 2022-09-16 02:49:49 bruh
help 2022-09-16 02:51:34 how can i make the f-2 intake? (its like an f-16 but larger and slightly different shape)
creations-chat 2022-09-16 02:54:41 they do not know what a turboprop is because turboprob is a JET engine
creations-chat 2022-09-16 02:56:44 i hate the insane amount of tutorial f-14's i see in every pvp lobby + that heli is amazing
creations-chat 2022-09-16 03:01:21 im not sure but they called the engine "turboprop" and it killed me along with those goofy wings
creations-chat 2022-09-16 03:04:14 what hurts more is that turboprop is a type of jet engine
creations-chat 2022-09-16 03:17:20 üíÄ  also the wings look like ass, use control surfaces and trapdoors
creations-chat 2022-09-16 03:19:42 motor locking and yes its still a jet engine, do you call a turbo jet engine a propeller engine because it has blades?
creations-chat 2022-09-16 03:22:02 note the wiki saying the "turbine" and the "intake" that dont sound very prop engine like. Its literally listed as  a jet engine, if your gonna use wiki to back up your claims then atlease be right about it

also the engine dont matter it still looks like ass
creations-chat 2022-09-16 03:24:45 also still looks like ass
creations-chat 2022-09-16 03:26:59 bro your not even educated enough to know simple jet engines let alone building or judging others with your severe lack of skill with building or making a plane that works because you refuse better methods of making the wings

depends on the type of cheese, that could be a gift
creations-chat 2022-09-16 03:29:49 motor locking, if you want it fancy then add some angle locking. Use trapdoors and control panels for wings for faster turning and auto stabilizing, also builds are meant to look nice

also trapdoors are 49x lighter than disconectors, skill issue

the point is to be in the sky...
creations-chat 2022-09-16 03:32:20 im confused whether to call the plane good bad or weird (the b-58)
creations-chat 2022-09-16 03:41:46 yes but have you ever seen a 1block wide a-10? its awful
creations-chat 2022-09-16 03:44:12 gotta get 3 or 2 block wide for any bomber, maybe 2 for a-10
creations-chat 2022-09-16 03:46:14 no
creations-chat 2022-09-16 17:31:54 why is it sad+ goofy upvote
creations-chat 2022-09-16 17:35:37 the community expects things to look good because of all the different ways we can get things to look good, they downvote when something looks like ass because they didnt care or think to add small details that make a good build

also if it looks like ass nobody cares about how it works, they care about looks and the ways you can get it to look good
creations-chat 2022-09-16 17:38:36 skill issue+get better at building+ratio+build better
creations-chat 2022-09-16 17:40:41 annoying person is being rude to people who thought a bad build looked bad and people dont like that they are defending the worst build (also i hate creations chat cooldown )

help 2022-09-16 22:46:04 well with air just just tune your jet, if wobble sideways then add vertical wing panels inside the plane (front or back) same with wobble upwards, just add wing panels in front or back
help 2022-09-16 22:46:42 if on ground then it might be a broken angle lock, make sure to lock the motors when angle locking and or there might be a moving part within the motor lock
help 2022-09-16 23:05:11 you need to lock and power the motors that the moving parts are on, if the lock isnt on they just glitch out and break
help 2022-09-16 23:07:15 when you do a angle lock type thing your making you must lock the moving motors to prevent them from glitching
help 2022-09-16 23:08:10 use purple tool and turn lock on the motors that do the moving, move the motors where you want then use the disconnectors <@653563056034545674>

creations-chat 2023-04-09 01:03:22 its good, just feel it should be lower on the nose but that would be a bit complex to do
help 2023-04-09 01:04:22 are all your motor 2's facing the proper way? also because they spawn in different ways they could just be moving to face to your cursor
creations-chat 2023-04-09 01:07:04 HOF hasnt been added to for a long ass time even if your jet was worthy it prob wouldnt be added
creations-chat 2023-04-09 01:09:08 couple hundred, around 300-400 and needs to be given a star emoji thing also 4000 block im pretty sure or thats just the masters thing idk
help 2023-04-09 01:20:56 mech design is easy, just make sure it doesnt break the joints and make it look like a power ranger rip off and you'll be golden
help 2023-04-09 01:27:33 its because its a tutorial frame, make your own and it will save time
help 2023-04-09 01:28:03 its the same as double rotor, might have to make it spin a bit faster though
help 2023-04-09 01:46:28 fake rotor can work but i find it more complex to add alot of tiny propellers instead of just balancing/adding drag
help 2023-04-09 01:48:33 eh my current heli is single prop with real propellers and its going pretty good though i can see how it would be good with the fake propellers so not my place to say, kinda a preference
help 2023-04-09 01:51:17 no problem but what do you mean the basic ones?
help 2023-04-09 01:52:11 tutorial as in technique or straight copying
help 2023-04-09 01:53:22 nah, the rotor doesnt mean anything the heli is the hard part
help 2023-04-09 01:53:31 hold on
help 2023-04-09 01:55:47 like i would reccoment to watch these vids https://youtu.be/bKO2UPoR27M he doesnt show you how to copy but rather technique and heli basics
help 2023-04-09 01:56:23 its not a straight copy but he explains how to balance, different ways to make a heli and different rotors through the series
help 2023-04-09 01:57:09 yeah he does good vids, pretty sure its ep 4 or 3 that is the single rotor basics
help 2023-04-09 02:00:09 are you familiar with motor/angle locking?
help 2023-04-09 02:02:26 eh its not far off from motor locking but im just gonna say motorlocks dont effect the rotor so if you have any design ideas that works but also i cant really help with balancing because well its impossible through text but experiment, make it look good and watch his tutorials if your serious about heli making
help 2023-04-09 02:04:30 ah, make sure to remember that ballast and heilium blocks exist, helps a ton
creations-chat 2023-04-09 02:48:13 <@740033004604227614> is that really 344 blocks though?
(and if it is why specify it on that dollar store sabre)
creations-chat 2023-04-09 02:50:17 thats kinda my point, it looks good at first glance but its too blocky for it to be that dense for no reason
creations-chat 2023-04-09 02:54:48 <@743927557262671912> please delete that

help 2023-04-09 04:06:41 you cant polish or improve shit, its still gonna be shit
help 2023-04-09 04:08:16 when people mess up they try again they dont just keep adding on to it, its like saying a pizza gets better the more cheese you add and you just dont add anything else
help 2023-04-09 04:09:10 you cant polish a turd its still gonna be shit, u gotta improve and learn
help 2023-04-09 04:11:22 plane crazy has a steep learning curve but once you know how your golden for as long as you play
help 2023-04-09 04:12:14 3 years üíÄ
help 2023-04-09 04:15:22 use towers, when you can add horizontal towers, see an angle thats hard to do? learn a bit about angle locking, wanna add lines to your cockpit? do a little a both, gotta learn to get good
help 2023-04-09 04:16:02 nobody starts with talent and it isnt helping to deny the proper way of creating good shit
help 2023-04-09 04:16:29 just dont use nam nam
help 2023-04-09 04:16:39 never make a nam nam jet
help 2023-04-09 04:17:29 i hate nam nam and his jets, they cant do anything but turn
help 2023-04-09 04:18:57 fr
help 2023-04-09 04:19:12 they all look the same
help 2023-04-09 04:20:52 yeah but you have to help yourself first, learn the basics of motor and angle locking then you shouldnt have any actual bad builds, i mean they can still turn out meh but with angle and motorlocking (even piston locking) it only takes time
help 2023-04-09 04:21:39 eh i watch this series on heli basics
help 2023-04-09 04:21:43 helps alot
help 2023-04-09 04:23:17 ah im in the middle of my first detailed heli, going alright but still suffering
help 2023-04-09 04:25:22 ngl yeah, its a small touch that usually adds to the build
help 2023-04-09 04:28:23 eh i usually start a side and top outline and go from there
help 2023-04-09 04:28:34 always make a tower though
help 2023-04-09 04:28:41 you will regret not having one
help 2023-04-09 04:31:00 i can relate, my towers end up being dry but i gotta be filling the towers
help 2023-04-09 04:31:17 but also the bottom tower?
help 2023-04-09 04:31:22 why and how
help 2023-04-09 04:33:32 idk im thinking about making a ship with my heli because its naval based but i dont know how that works
help 2023-04-09 04:34:24 eh i have a bad habit of not making the most of a tower, like i can and do sometimes but occasionally its just bare and ugly lookin
help 2023-04-09 04:37:02 aw i do that all the time it hurts on a chrome
help 2023-04-09 04:38:59 also when you make an actual vehicle make sure to try to have every angle, like if you can find a free 3d model use it, if you can find real photo's use em if you can find blueprints find those too, always find things to base off of
help 2023-04-09 04:40:28 the thing is lemmy the best way to restart is to actually just restart, if you fix a bad build its still gonna be bad its just gonna be alright looking
help 2023-04-09 04:41:49 the whole ps5 block part and flat sides, people like detail when its possible and in a game of pc where there can be as much detail as you want they will expect as much as you can
help 2023-04-09 04:42:12 so when you or i deliver a shittly low effort build it isnt tolerated
help 2023-04-09 04:43:25 like ya see all the angles textures and things on that, that make it look good? when you leave those out your left with a ps5
help 2023-04-09 04:43:51 thats not your build though
help 2023-04-09 04:44:00 send your build photo
help 2023-04-09 04:46:25 like you see how your build looks bad with less angles less detail and has things missing? thats why people dont like it
help 2023-04-09 04:47:01 also how this is a 2 seater when your build is a one seater
help 2023-04-09 04:47:55 its missing a seat the front the engine the side wing the weapon holder the spikes
help 2023-04-09 04:48:22 thats exactly what you need
help 2023-04-09 04:48:31 what do you think teachers do all day

creations-chat 2023-04-09 22:11:34 If things move then the center of gravity moves
creations-chat 2023-04-09 22:14:11 Please delete this it‚Äôs beyond saving
creations-chat 2023-04-09 22:29:48 Why is it coloured like a 2016 Minecraft skin
creations-chat 2023-04-09 22:51:50 ‚úÖ what
creations-chat 2023-04-09 22:54:16 Like the m2m tutorial saved a few of my jets, though seeing 7 nam nam jets in a pvp server hurts my soul
creations-chat 2023-04-09 22:56:27 I mean the nam nam jets are good but they are horribly optimized to turn, I made one once and it did nothing but turn and I couldn‚Äôt edit or change anything after the main build, but they are so ugly now I realise what good jets are
help 2023-04-10 00:10:19 I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs alright but you should Thicken the wings a bit and make it more smooth
help 2023-04-10 00:55:34 learn how to motor lock, dont just cheat and ask people how it takes 5 seconds to learn
help 2023-04-10 00:56:34 yeah
creations-chat 2023-04-10 04:30:13 motor boat
help 2023-04-10 04:31:55 gotta ask how to angle lock angles of the outer shell of a heli without exposed/filling the room with locks, tryna make a transport heli and currently dying with angles and window lines
creations-chat 2023-04-10 21:13:57 i mean yeah you could say that but if you walked around with the symbol in a jewish area with a sign saying that is was peaceful would you be suprised to be kicked out
creations-chat 2023-04-10 21:16:06 well yeah but im just sayin people who say that are kinda stupid because well after a funny mustache man i dont think the meaning is the same at all
creations-chat 2023-04-10 21:22:02 im not gonna say im offended by it but you cant really say the windmill isnt offensive because after a very popular austrian commited mass genocide with that symbol it kinda out weights the "peace" part of it
creations-chat 2023-04-10 21:24:04 if your gonna go anywhere and protest the bad meaning of the windmill hope you know most people are gonna think your a na*i because well it caused MASS GENOCIDE and IS NOT A PEACE SYMBOL
creations-chat 2023-04-10 21:29:09 you cant use the cultural excuse because IT KILLED 7 MILLION PEOPLE, its just a bit beyond having culture save it after the war it caused killed over 20 MILLION PEOPLE, it aint  a good symbol you dunce
creations-chat 2023-04-10 21:32:01 i still do, that build was ass did you delete that shitty ukraine heli?
also <@989353863695966209> it doesnt matter imagine if the pope caused mass genocide that led to the deaths of around 30 million total, people wouldnt want to be christian because the would be associated with THE PEOPLE WHOLE KILLED AROUND 30 MILLION PEOPLE

creations-chat 2023-04-13 01:05:31 its low effort and shitty
creations-chat 2023-04-13 01:08:06 they coulda atleast added on a barrel or motorlock them together to make a lazer but its just 2 servo motors and some guns, its pretty ass
creations-chat 2023-04-26 00:05:16 its good tho
creations-chat 2023-04-26 00:07:20 its a swarm of good jets with good quality, it would be more strange if it wasnt upvoted, also how is it copyed?
