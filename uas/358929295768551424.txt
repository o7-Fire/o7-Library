plane-crazy 2020-05-30 14:59:36 > He literally means 100 bombs, but no specification in mass
<@!105723378949718016> adding 100 bombs to a small world war 2 fighter would make it a brick too heavy to even lift off the ground, especially my tiny ass j7w1
plane-crazy 2020-05-30 14:11:40 100 bombs as in kamikaze attack or 100 bombs as in 100kg bombs
