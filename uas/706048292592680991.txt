bot-central 2023-06-29 02:08:34 Oh
bot-central 2023-06-29 02:08:35 lets go
creations-chat 2023-06-29 03:04:23 alright thanks for the motorlock and color suggestions, ill use those soon. but for the proportions part, I researched pretty much every part, including the landing legs, and I think I built everything correctly
same goes for the engine layout
creations-chat 2023-06-30 06:42:10 Yeah, we both built it pretty similarly.

Look again though, I have a different engine layout, longer landing legs, the legs and grid fins are rotated differently, and the fairing is shorter.
If ur still skeptical, I can DM you the rocket in build mode and compare it to his. (I'm not home rn so it'll take a while)
creations-chat 2023-06-30 07:25:40 Oh, thanks
