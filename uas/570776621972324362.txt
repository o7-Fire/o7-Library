creations-chat 2020-09-26 22:06:48 this rips apart cutterbugs as they try to attack me.

creations-chat 2020-09-27 19:04:24 > No shut the fuck up and leave the discord
<@456226577798135808> 
I meant to say "anti cutterbug shredder"
creations-chat 2020-09-27 21:47:17 This is the frame for my new anti cutterbug shredder, all the gaps are gonna be filled with cutters(beside the wheel wells) i am officially joining the cutterbug rebellion
creations-chat 2020-09-27 21:47:55 thanks!
creations-chat 2020-09-27 21:48:35 should i make it tall or short?
creations-chat 2020-09-27 21:49:18 short it is.
creations-chat 2020-09-27 21:50:36 *oh no*
creations-chat 2020-09-27 21:51:56 im gonna use 1x1 blocks to build the walls of this thing, it wil make it harder to destroy as there are more peices evident.
creations-chat 2020-09-27 21:54:37 so the ww2 german symbol isnt allowed, is the hammer and sycle?
creations-chat 2020-09-27 21:58:14 should i use winter wheels or normal wheels if im building something heavy?
creations-chat 2020-09-27 21:58:34 oki
creations-chat 2020-09-27 22:11:29 they need to add a mirror mode...
creations-chat 2020-09-27 22:15:21 this is how im layering my cutterbug shredder, everything is a 1x1 block, so it takes longer to shred down to the core.
creations-chat 2020-09-27 22:24:32 IM OUT OF GOSHDARN CUTTERS
creations-chat 2020-09-27 22:31:04 who else thinks they should add cannons to the game? like tank cannons.
creations-chat 2020-09-27 22:32:34 what if i made a self propelled cannon that loaded itself very complicatedly?
creations-chat 2020-09-27 22:33:39 > Do we really this mf to have bigger guns?
<@456226577798135808>
creations-chat 2020-09-27 22:33:55 y e s. yes we shall.

It is 1/4 cutter and 3/4 1x1 block.
creations-chat 2020-09-27 23:31:08 > why not... just use BEAMS
<@484529511468236802> 
To make it harder for cutterbugs to shred through.
creations-chat 2020-09-27 23:32:51 My highest speed record is 622615572537677... and idk the rest of the numbers bc the speed gauge didnt show them
