creations-chat 2021-08-07 14:20:46 8/10
creations-chat 2021-08-08 00:34:10 Eh, to me, the design just looks bland, you should motor lock the gun, add details and such, and maybe make the aiming thingy (i forgot what its called) more accurate. Also, motorlocc it more <:4Weird:709084058721714324>
creations-chat 2021-08-08 00:40:10 Okay i get the gun, but the "aiming thingy" from what i can tell from the picture doesnt look accurate, as in, the accuracy isnt that good, if that makes sense to you
creations-chat 2021-08-08 00:42:12 This isnt accurate at all yk
creations-chat 2021-08-08 00:44:46 Oh okay. It doesnt matter anyways, its still a decent build. 6.5/10
creations-chat 2021-08-10 22:47:48 To the people who downvoted, please give feedback

Do roles really matter in this server that much, i could not give a fuck about them, they dont prove if your good at the game or not  üíÄ

Just something i noticed

Nah because i see lots of people with tons of roles, but like, they are ass
creations-chat 2022-06-03 01:45:24 I upgraded it and it looks 10x better now

I was too lazy to try and get roles from it

Istg if you take the design, its called the sa2 samson, please, copy that not my build

creations-chat 2022-06-03 01:52:56 Lol, i know, im just saying if you want a good build balance performance AND asthetics


I didnt invalidate your fact, its true, shaders make your build look better than normal, its just not... a bad thing
creations-chat 2022-06-03 01:55:49 Pretty cool but, it would be better if asthetics played a role too
creations-chat 2022-06-03 01:59:29 Also, ive noticed most of your builds dont actually really function like the real thing, (not your joke builds), if your not focusing on asthetics, or mechanics, what are you focusing on?
