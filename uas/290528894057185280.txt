creations-chat 2021-02-14 01:38:40 well i want everything to be accurate and thats what i could come up with
maybe it may change some time or maybe not. idk
creations-chat 2021-02-14 01:51:20 ye ill agree on that. im not good at taking good pics like u guys are lmao
creations-chat 2021-02-14 01:54:35 *mhm ima try again once i finish consooming f00d*
creations-chat 2021-02-14 02:10:38 wat would u think now?
creations-chat 2021-02-14 02:38:12 welp maybe something with the barrel is the tank's biggest problem then
creations-chat 2021-02-14 02:45:37 yes
creations-chat 2021-02-14 02:48:02 oh.... dang its apparently the same length as the tank itself XD
ima go ahead and decrease the length now
creations-chat 2021-02-14 02:55:44 alr now i plan to remake the barrel but its decreased by 5 blocks this time and it actually looks more fitting
creations-chat 2021-02-14 03:58:44 we need more tanks
creations-chat 2021-02-18 10:10:42 anything i could improve on this type 5 heavy tho?

creations-chat 2021-02-18 10:21:26 welcome aboard
creations-chat 2021-02-18 10:51:52 HOLLYY
creations-chat 2021-02-19 07:21:21 
creations-chat 2021-03-02 06:46:09 -see, i didnt want to replace the main gun with sparklers because i did that with the secondary gun on the side and i dont want them to be the same size
i agree with u on the other suggestions tho. ill get to working on it so it can be as accurate as possible. thanks for these suggestions too
creations-chat 2021-03-03 11:22:05 wat u guys think of my centauro mgs? its still a wip ofc cuz i gotta add the machine guns and crap but i wanna know if i did well enough so far?
creations-chat 2021-03-03 11:31:59 Yeah thats like some of the few things i need to add still...
creations-chat 2021-03-03 23:04:45 ye i have no idea how i can hide some of that motor lock crap in a barrel with limited space...
creations-chat 2021-03-03 23:12:58 yeah ill try to add more stuff although there isnt really alot on the actual tank itself
ill give it a bit of work tho
creations-chat 2021-03-09 07:28:50 bill nye the science guy
creations-chat 2021-03-25 22:03:16 so uh.... anyone can explain this new trend in <#384025409945337856> tho..?
creations-chat 2021-03-25 22:23:10 o god...
creations-chat 2021-04-29 20:52:45 hm i could try... i never really use materials like that on tanks tbh
creations-chat 2021-04-30 06:04:15 wtf is astrocraft
creations-chat 2021-05-20 13:30:07 wats wrong with it?
creations-chat 2021-05-20 13:32:23 lmao i dont even know. child's weird
creations-chat 2021-05-20 13:36:08 ill try... had just got done and wanted to see wat ppl's feedback would be
creations-chat 2021-05-20 13:39:31 dang.. sounds like either i need a re-do or just not make another kv2 at all ig...
creations-chat 2021-05-20 13:43:03 alr ill give that a try then. and ngl, i rly have trouble finding a good color for tanks so yeah... that may explain the trashy color
creations-chat 2021-05-20 13:48:48 o well thanks! thats just how this server works tbh but i barely care for a dislike. i just want to get feedback
the likes i get is also nice to see too
creations-chat 2021-05-20 14:07:29 not funny and it rly wasnt even that horrible if it still gets upvotes from some people
creations-chat 2021-05-20 14:09:45 again since u cant read, i said i just posted it after i was done with it for feedback. not as a final product....
also u rly dont have to be rude like that tbh
creations-chat 2021-05-20 14:11:47 mk but still. just saying u shouldnt have to go as far as saying its a "kaka-v2" its was highly uncalled for and i never said anything bad to u
creations-chat 2021-05-20 16:18:02 ok i gave my kv2 a bit of an upgrade as far as with color and other small stuff.
creations-chat 2021-05-20 16:29:27 anyone wanna provide feedback tho on my kv2 after i improved it?
creations-chat 2021-05-20 16:32:18 ye i try to hide it <:trollface:775024642104229898>
creations-chat 2021-05-21 15:20:49 ko
creations-chat 2021-05-25 16:36:53 good looking type 59 so far or needs work?
creations-chat 2021-05-25 16:39:09 ph yeah i havent connected those just yet so they fell off but when i do, youll probs see about half of it since theyre like front wheels
creations-chat 2021-05-25 16:52:34 i wonder wat kind of color should i rly go for tho...
creations-chat 2021-05-25 16:59:03 meh that can work then
creations-chat 2021-05-25 22:30:15 well if i did add another wheel, it would make the tank longer and i was thinking by then, itll be too long for its width
also i could agree with that turret problem. may fix it tomorrow though
creations-chat 2021-05-25 22:37:20 *oop rip...* i kinda just do the front first then the wheels here
creations-chat 2021-05-26 01:14:36 hotels tend to be bigger than motels
creations-chat 2021-05-26 01:17:24 basically yeah
creations-chat 2021-05-26 13:35:17 looks better than my type-59 post from yesterday?
creations-chat 2021-05-26 13:38:41 *couldnt think of a better one soo o well*
creations-chat 2021-05-26 22:56:16 un-ok
creations-chat 2021-05-28 19:37:29 any thoughts on this future M3A3 Bradley?
also, idk if this paint is good enough. i just tried to copy war thunder's original paint scheme
creations-chat 2021-05-28 19:43:14 makes me wish i still had my guns <:nooo:787097964946259978>
creations-chat 2021-05-28 19:57:53 accurate except not in my case cuz i got no planes
creations-chat 2021-05-29 16:01:02 thats just gonna be harder to work with a smaller turret tbh considering it was a challenge trying to cram a bunch of motors and stuff within my current one and also, that turret kinda looks smaller than what i used
creations-chat 2021-05-29 16:46:11 how do u run that on mobile? lmao
creations-chat 2021-07-13 19:51:02 its no where near a tutorial. do u want to see it in build mode?
creations-chat 2021-07-13 19:53:11 what should i fix on the abrams tho since it has more downvotes than upvotes?
creations-chat 2021-07-13 19:55:25 ??
