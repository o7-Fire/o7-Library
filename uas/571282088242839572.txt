creations-chat 2022-01-10 17:17:53 I dont own that emote sadly
creations-chat 2022-01-10 17:20:00 Theres some downvotes so i guess some people dont like AOT lol
creations-chat 2022-01-10 17:22:13 Why though? im curious
creations-chat 2022-01-10 17:26:29 So when a build is pretty solid but its based off a vehicle in an anime your opinion is:
''yoo this shit is trash! KYS?!''

(Aka you guys are children)
creations-chat 2022-01-10 17:30:06 Nah im talking to the guys who downvote purely cause theyre too smallminded and think its ass cause its from an anime
creations-chat 2022-01-10 17:32:49 ''Aight this airship looks pretty decen- YO ITS FROM AOT?? BRUH THIS SHIT IS ASS!!''
creations-chat 2022-01-10 17:39:16 That would be an actual alright argument,  But if you hate on it cause you hate anime (even though alot of people who do, do not have an argument to why they hate it, they just follow people who say its bad)  youre kinda a child
creations-chat 2022-01-10 17:42:29 tbh i shouldnt really expect something from someone named Poopymanlikespeetoo
creations-chat 2022-01-10 17:48:39 Not really neccesary ig since im not gonna argue anymore with someone who cannot grasp the simple concept of being a bit openminded since he is probably young
creations-chat 2022-01-10 17:53:54 Im calling him young cause i think he isn't very old since alot of young people are very set towards one opinion cause they think thats whats right even though theres no argument for it
And yes i do watch cartoons but that doesnt neccesarily mean someone is really young, though i am (16)
Also not all anime are specifically ''kids'' shows

creations-chat 2022-01-10 18:06:48 Yes but why do you think that?? i wont judge i am just curious about why you think anime is bad. like what aspects of it do you not like
creations-chat 2022-01-10 18:11:33 how so
creations-chat 2022-01-10 18:14:21 Valid argument imo, alot of anime fans are downright incels
