help 2019-01-01 18:31:08 I made a fish, since all the engines, apart from propellers, make it fly, so I decided to use propellers, now it doesn't fly, and it moves a good speed, but now it dives half-way underwater, or turns on it's side and constantly spins. :|
help 2019-01-01 18:33:19 Anybody know how to fix it?

bug-reports 2019-01-02 12:00:31 I found a glitch where you can fly in ragdoll, if you build a grid like this:
bug-reports 2019-01-02 12:00:35 
bug-reports 2019-01-02 12:00:41 Then start, and use ragdoll,
bug-reports 2019-01-02 12:01:18 When you stop, and start, and stop again (while in the seat), you will be ragdoll in a seat, then if you jump out, you just start flying.

creations-chat 2019-01-03 17:44:43 it barely went upwards without doing about a million barrel rolls
creations-chat 2019-01-03 17:46:06 It also wouldn't turn.
creations-chat 2019-01-03 18:12:41 Which is why I modified it
creations-chat 2019-01-03 18:13:23 No....
creations-chat 2019-01-03 18:13:38 I've added more than that.
creations-chat 2019-01-03 21:06:10 <@456226577798135808> Who said it had to look good?

creations-chat 2019-01-28 21:19:43 xd
bug-reports 2019-01-28 21:44:06 I know, but if the wing is touching the seat, shouldn't it be connected?
creations-chat 2019-01-28 22:01:31 No, it's not.
creations-chat 2019-01-28 22:01:38 I got the idea from the video,
creations-chat 2019-01-28 22:01:46 so I tried to make it smaller and better
creations-chat 2019-01-28 22:02:21 <@456226577798135808>
creations-chat 2019-01-28 22:02:45 I would have removed 3 blocks.
creations-chat 2019-01-28 22:02:52 Which I did not.
creations-chat 2019-01-28 22:03:24 I changed the blocks, so that the blocks were smaller, instead of a 1x2 control surface, I changed it to a 1x1, etc
creations-chat 2019-01-28 22:03:59 That would be removing 1 block
creations-chat 2019-01-28 22:04:00 not 3
creations-chat 2019-01-28 22:14:34 Okay, 4 blocks not changed, 2 changed, and 3 added, which is more than 50% of it 'copied'.
creations-chat 2019-01-28 22:16:59 Correction, 4 blocks not changed, 3 changed, and 4 added.
creations-chat 2019-01-28 22:28:15 Less than 50% of it copied*
creations-chat 2019-01-28 22:31:24 Still, I was accused of having '90%' of it copied, because people don't know what 'etc' means.
creations-chat 2019-01-28 22:57:35 Gonna have to get banned, Ravin. It's a low effort build.
creations-chat 2019-01-28 23:02:39 Also, how am I supposed to be banned, if I changed my name?
creations-chat 2019-01-28 23:03:00 sad
creations-chat 2019-01-28 23:03:04 I jusst checked
creations-chat 2019-01-28 23:03:07 On the player list
creations-chat 2019-01-28 23:03:34 Well, you said 'low effort builds and your gonna get creations banned'
creations-chat 2019-01-28 23:03:54 Ravin made a low effort build,
creations-chat 2019-01-28 23:04:01 <:lul:526445157847924736>
creations-chat 2019-01-28 23:05:28 No, it's hard work, try making a plane like that, which flies, does not tip over, does not crash every time, flies smoothly, not so it is constantly wobbling, etc.
creations-chat 2019-01-28 23:05:52 Any other variation I tried, failed.
creations-chat 2019-01-29 16:02:49 <@!295568493166985218> Gonna have to ban Rez, his plane only used a small amount of blocks, and apparently that's not allowed, well that's what you said to me anyway.
creations-chat 2019-01-29 16:14:50 Check <#504436696021204992> and scroll up a bit,
creations-chat 2019-01-29 16:14:59 because apparently small things are not allowed.
creations-chat 2019-01-29 16:16:17 *cough*
creations-chat 2019-01-29 16:16:41 And apparently planes that are small, are not effort.
creations-chat 2019-01-29 16:17:11 You said small planes are not allowed.
creations-chat 2019-01-29 16:17:35 So Rez has to get banned, just like you told me I would when I built a small plane :)
creations-chat 2019-01-29 16:19:35 I'm not trying to use your own words against you, I'm just saying that Rez has to get banned, because If I'm not allowed to make a small plane, which is diffent to a tutorial, nobody can.
creations-chat 2019-01-29 16:20:28 .
creations-chat 2019-01-29 16:20:34 So now planes have to look good?
creations-chat 2019-01-29 16:21:48 Still, why am I the only one who gets affected by a dumb rule which stops me making small planes that have to look good?
creations-chat 2019-01-29 16:24:04 So somebody who posts a picture of an entirely empty plot, is allowed to post it, because it's 'wonderwomans invisible jet'?
creations-chat 2019-01-29 16:25:09 Exactly.
creations-chat 2019-01-29 16:25:39 And that small plane, wasn't a 'joke build'.
creations-chat 2019-01-29 16:26:29 And I don't see the point of getting threatend to be banned, because I made a small plane.
creations-chat 2019-01-29 16:27:05 You said I was pushing it as gold.
creations-chat 2019-01-29 16:27:18 I just said I was building a small plane.
creations-chat 2019-01-29 16:27:43 You're banning me from creating small builds..
creations-chat 2019-01-29 16:29:30 And anyway, people can't be banned from the game, for making planes.
creations-chat 2019-01-29 16:29:47 The rules state that you can be banned from POSTING planes for 3 days.
creations-chat 2019-01-29 16:30:49 I saw that mistake.
creations-chat 2019-01-29 16:31:40 And I made it use more blocks, I changed it, and made it stop shaking.
creations-chat 2019-01-29 16:32:20 There was literally two blocks not changed.
creations-chat 2019-02-16 22:54:49 <@!511080180966752256> Funny, I saw that plane on youtube.
