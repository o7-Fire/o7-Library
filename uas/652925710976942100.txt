creations-chat 2021-12-13 01:32:01 Compared to the actual paint job it’s pretty spot on and the reason the canopy is a lil too pointy is because it’s a little challenging to angle it when I tnt lock it eventually

creations-chat 2022-01-21 16:14:59 <@!769636174259814440> You cant make small patterns out of text as its impossible. <@!640019398387564584> There are no lights that are as thick as a disconnector so blocky lights must be used. <@!723940197456281640> I dont make videos out of them because they are scenery mostly and dont have anything behind them, I do add a little story/context behind them tho.
creations-chat 2022-01-21 16:17:05 The lights must be hanging and sticking out like the og pic,
creations-chat 2022-01-21 16:21:41 Actually 🤓, the first level does eventually get more objects in them as you traverse further in. Office items such as desks and cabinets eventually start to appear.

creations-chat 2022-01-22 04:15:50 You should look at some of madvulpens guide's, they're very informative and overall helpful.
creations-chat 2022-01-22 04:22:34 Yep its a necessity for this game, as well as angle locking, using camera's, and tnt locking which imo is better than normal motor locking. Madvulpens vids should teach you most of that

creations-chat 2022-01-22 04:49:34 You are pretty good at scenery from your builds so I think that tye hotel would be awesome for you to do, also when I make my posts I get my camera angle exactly how it is in the og pictures so your's would look similar to sorry for shit quality i sent this from my tablet
creations-chat 2022-01-22 04:52:16 You don't have to make level tho choose any level that you'd feel comfortable doing, here have the link to the levels https://backrooms.fandom.com/wiki/Level_List

creations-chat 2022-01-22 04:56:49 Send progress! Good luck!
creations-chat 2022-01-22 05:01:15 First one for sure. The angle should be easy

creations-chat 2022-01-22 16:55:43 They should make a scenery/building rank for people that like to make stuff besides vehicles, there would be required blocks and upvotes for each rank so people couldn't build stuff that takes no skill.

creations-chat 2022-04-07 02:33:28 It looks really good besides the poo rudder coloring. I can see it being fixable tho
creations-chat 2022-04-07 02:36:40 Take the bottom left 1x2 delta should be flipped on the horizontal axis. Also change said delta into a 1x4 / 1x3. Doing that would fix the look entirely imo

creations-chat 2022-05-16 13:45:45 Angel lock?
creations-chat 2022-05-16 13:47:31 I’m just hyped as hell for the rescale tool tbh. It’s gonna help out so much.
creations-chat 2022-05-16 13:51:12 It’d be cool if they added a copy paste tool for blocks so you could copy parts of a build that need to be duplicated
creations-chat 2022-05-16 14:07:16 But with a mirror tool you’d need a mirror plane to choose how it’s mirrored and that could get complicated
creations-chat 2022-05-16 14:09:07 That’s what I’m sayin
creations-chat 2022-05-16 14:34:40 I mean ig yeah they would be more abundant but that just means more content for Gjsolo <:clueless:942802644043464734>
creations-chat 2022-05-16 14:46:09 Where sexy F-14???
creations-chat 2022-05-16 14:53:52 Have you given the pistons like 5 seconds after moving them? They need time to stabilize. It’s a well known bug that if you lock right after you move your pistons the whole build has a spasm

creations-chat 2022-05-16 19:52:14 Yes, Gran Turdismo 7 to be exact
creations-chat 2022-05-16 20:15:08 That’s laughable

creations-chat 2022-05-16 21:23:07 Angle locking exists. You can literally attach another tower onto it <:m_:778994206948589638>
creations-chat 2022-05-16 21:25:51 Good idea

creations-chat 2022-05-16 22:49:46 Indeed
creations-chat 2022-05-16 23:17:15 I wonder how hard it would be to make motors like cameras. In the sense of them being invisible when you spawn in
creations-chat 2022-05-16 23:21:44 Would that be beneficial to the game tho? I might make a suggestion
creations-chat 2022-05-16 23:26:36 Made the suggestion

creations-chat 2022-07-15 03:26:39 You could replace the 1x2 part of the lerx and make it a 1x3 then pull the 1x4 forward by 1 or .5
creations-chat 2022-07-15 03:30:27 Then make the 1x3 a 1x4 and pull the second 1x4 in the back forward, that should fill in the gap
