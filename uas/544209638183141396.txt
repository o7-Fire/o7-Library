creations-chat 2023-02-06 22:08:40 Most likely because the build is mediocre and most people here have high standards so most likely you will get downvoted unless u have a really good build or if the build is unique which a bus really isnt anyways. I guess the build is fine but its not  good good if you want to have a lot of upvotes spend a lot of time on your build, anyways   Like its alright but why are you complaining about spending 5 days, 5 days isnt that much for a plane crazy build, but anyways if you want a better upvote to downvote ratio put more effort in (im not saying you arent just more)

creations-chat 2023-02-06 22:13:36 Why are you so mad about a downvote? your build isnt the holy grail of all builds anyways youre having a childish overreaction youre gonna get downvoted so deal with it
