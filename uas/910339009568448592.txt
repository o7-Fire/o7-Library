help 2022-08-18 09:09:53 Okay so my plan is to re use the design idea ive been using which is using half blocks as much as possible to keep the plane looking as light but good looking as possible, use the new dragless wings and engine method, and find out how to make some sort of trim for my yaw axis
help 2022-08-18 09:17:39 Im also thinking that past 1k theres some sort of physics change in the way wings behave and I want to know if I can find a way to prove it, and find a way to get around the problem
