creations-chat 2020-10-13 03:24:41 Do i ping staff here to request hall-of-fame? I read the faq but V0xelBox's and purifiedwater's DMs are off
creations-chat 2020-10-13 03:25:51 who are the other moderators
creations-chat 2020-10-13 03:37:55 Who are the staff here besides V0xelBox, purifiedwater, Arjunn_, RoboRail1, and Yousuf?
I've contacted all them to request HoF but none of their Dms are on.
creations-chat 2020-10-13 03:40:10 oh hai mod
creations-chat 2020-10-13 03:41:29 tsunami's dm is off as well, why do the FAQ ask us to dm mods when all of their dms are off.
creations-chat 2020-11-30 06:42:39 I don't understand this dude’s thought process, you’ll still get warned even if it’s other’s build or ping the creator. Like everyone said, you posted it.
