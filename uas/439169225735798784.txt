creations-chat 2021-01-31 11:26:20 well, with that body, i couldnt really do much about it, as its a cylinder type of external tank, but thanks for the feedback though

creations-chat 2021-02-26 03:28:16 i want to drop a little boy on furry conventions, 1945 all over again
creations-chat 2021-02-26 03:30:24 we use the ultimate one, tzar bomba, drop 50 of these on each furry convention, that should do it
creations-chat 2021-02-26 03:33:25 alr heres a good plan, we capture furries, and torture them, giving secrets on where they are hiding, then we all put them in gas chambers, and have them all suffer
creations-chat 2021-02-26 03:37:05 actually, we do all of what i said, but instead of just putting them in gas chambers, we skin them alive first
creations-chat 2021-02-26 03:47:27 really? damn i thought theyd have more than that, at least a few hundred or so
creations-chat 2021-02-26 03:51:53 i mean, comparing it to a scale, like america, i thought theyd have more, to scare america, but im still surprised they only have one

V - 100 megatons would probably kill about 1/4 of the island its on
creations-chat 2021-02-26 03:54:50 it first went from having everyone against one furry for sending a single message, then turning into nuclear conversations, and here we are right now
creations-chat 2021-02-28 19:54:43 lol, i feel bad for u long
creations-chat 2021-02-28 19:58:28 nah hes probably sad (he lost court, thats why he has that pfp)
creations-chat 2021-03-01 03:17:58 the impossible has been done
creations-chat 2021-03-01 03:30:08 im genuinely impressed with that f-35, everything's perfect, the intakes, the intake fan, the after burner, and im still trying to figure out how to do the intakes on that thing, 5 stars man
creations-chat 2021-03-01 03:40:02 jesus christ... ive never seen motor lock so advanced before, how long did this take
creations-chat 2021-03-01 03:42:22 damn, i thought it took like 3 weeks or even a month, that looks really hard to make
creations-chat 2021-03-01 03:48:36 idk man, im literally shaking, that the impossible has been done, ive been trying to figure out how to do the intakes, for a while now
creations-chat 2021-03-01 05:53:26 guys, <@456226577798135808> is not a furry, he lost court, so he is forced to have a furry pfp for 2.5 months
creations-chat 2021-03-01 05:55:29 to back it up, here
creations-chat 2021-03-01 05:58:29 there was defendants, and a judge, there was no jury, due to lack of members, so just basically the judge was the jury
creations-chat 2021-03-01 06:01:05 defendants = attorney

no, the suspects were me and long,
and the attorney was our friends, my close friend, and longs close friend
creations-chat 2021-03-01 06:06:18 lemme explain, the whole thing was about long accousing me that i was a furry ,because i have a doge head or whatever, so then we said we would take it to court, and we decided what punishments and how long, we did a server vote, and it was furry pfp, and it was for 2.5 months, so we did court, longs friend had lack of evidence, because he said he was new, my friend had tons of stuff to back me up, so after, it was said that i was not guilty, and long was pissed, then now he has to have furry pfp for 2.5 months

<@!718006867808485447> yeah, this server hates furries, understandable though
creations-chat 2021-03-01 06:08:46 im not an alt though, ive joined in 2018, and long proves a point
