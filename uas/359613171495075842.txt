plane-crazy 2020-05-12 19:46:16 just noticed one is literally falling off lol
plane-crazy 2020-05-12 19:46:02 uh i think these tracks might need some tightening...
plane-crazy 2020-03-25 20:13:08 it works, it's just really slow
plane-crazy 2020-03-25 20:05:32 imma try it
plane-crazy 2020-03-25 20:05:08 you would have to un-anchor and re-anchor the blocks yourself, i don't mean that the pistons will just push the anchored blocks
plane-crazy 2020-03-25 20:04:16 that gave me an idea, would it be possible to make a flyingmachine like in minecraft using pistons and anchor blocks
