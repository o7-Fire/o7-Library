creations-chat 2019-11-24 09:07:45 Is there a way to make some sort of stabilizer to keep your creations from falling over or tipping?
creations-chat 2019-11-24 09:08:40 No

help 2021-02-13 09:36:34 How do I get image perms?
Also, How do you make very big creations float at regular gravity? Is there a certain amount of helium blocks you have to place in order for it to be almost like zero gravity, or is there an easy method?
help 2021-02-13 09:40:34 My build has about 4000 blocks in it (3919 to be exact), and I wanna know how to make it float before finishing it.
help 2021-02-13 09:41:02 It's only A Third done
help 2021-02-13 09:41:14 So I expect it to have about 9000+ blocks
help 2021-02-13 09:41:21 Maybe 10k

help 2021-02-14 16:23:26 Heyyaaaaa um, is there a quick way for anyone to explain how pilot seats work? I'm trying to make escape pods for my KFC Infinity
help 2021-02-14 16:24:04 I looked up on yt but nothing is there, just a lot of "ejector seat" tutorials
help 2021-02-14 16:24:20 Yeah, but when I try to control things with it, it doesn't work
help 2021-02-14 16:24:43 Are friends able to control it?
help 2021-02-14 16:24:54 Awww
help 2021-02-14 16:24:57 That's sad
help 2021-02-14 16:26:52 This game is hardcoded right? So would that get in the way of them making pilot seats useable by friends?
help 2021-02-14 16:33:43 Aight! Thank you, I don't mind how long it takes, so I hope if they were to change things they really take their time.
