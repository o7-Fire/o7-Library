creations-chat 2020-04-11 20:56:40 Decided to goof around with trails and ended up making this really cool rainbow.
creations-chat 2020-04-12 01:52:01 I made an airstrike drone. It can go really fast, hovers off of ground, and has a turret in the front for fighting. It has 248 blocks in total.
creations-chat 2020-04-12 01:52:14 This is how much blocks it has
creations-chat 2020-04-12 02:01:56 o
creations-chat 2020-04-12 02:01:58 ok
creations-chat 2020-04-12 02:14:42 could u not spam ur creation? we only need to see one angle of it; plus, it makes it so people cant see other creations above it
creations-chat 2020-04-12 02:54:42 cool
help 2020-04-14 03:35:46 when i activate the propellers using motors, they keep spinning to the right. how do i sto pthat from happening?
help 2020-04-14 03:36:20 uh
help 2020-04-14 03:36:31 they just spin the opposite direction
help 2020-04-14 03:36:36 ohhh
help 2020-04-14 03:36:40 ok, i will try that
help 2020-04-14 03:38:58 just did that, when i activate it, it does not go up or down
help 2020-04-14 03:39:04 it is basically as if i never turned em on
help 2020-04-14 03:39:27 right, will try
help 2020-04-14 03:39:43 well if i invert the blade, the same thing happens
help 2020-04-14 03:39:58 because when i make the blades normally go the opposite direction it goes down
help 2020-04-14 03:40:05 when they go the normal direction they go up
help 2020-04-14 03:40:18 so if there are 2 equal forces of down and up, it will basically be as if it is off
help 2020-04-14 03:40:59 this is why i hate when people dislike my drone just because it has hover pads
help 2020-04-14 03:41:14 where if i were to do blades, it would just be this wierd spinning thing
help 2020-04-14 03:41:59 k
help 2020-04-14 03:42:02 i will do that
help 2020-04-14 03:44:50 ah yes the same thing happens, it does nothing
help 2020-04-14 03:45:29 i just wanted to make an airdrop drone that drops explosives on stuff
help 2020-04-14 03:45:34 and i literally cant
help 2020-04-14 03:46:04 and if i put hover pads, the community hates it because they 'want to see more builds without hover pads'
help 2020-04-14 03:46:14 what does max torque even do
help 2020-04-14 03:46:26 and which blades should i do it too
help 2020-04-14 03:46:29 'to
help 2020-04-14 03:46:41 well all speed is set to 30
help 2020-04-14 03:47:00 so what should i set it to for the circled blades
help 2020-04-14 03:47:10 alright
help 2020-04-14 03:47:17 i will change the others to 25
help 2020-04-14 03:47:20 to make it half
help 2020-04-14 03:47:50 no
help 2020-04-14 03:48:11 the top motor is for going up / down with it, and the bottom motor is for hovering above planes and stuff
help 2020-04-14 03:48:20 rn i am only using the top motor
help 2020-04-14 03:48:24 and it literally does nothing=
help 2020-04-14 03:48:28 same result
help 2020-04-14 03:49:14 nope
help 2020-04-14 03:50:34 it is literally impossible to make a drone without hover pads. If i use thrusters for it, then when i am hovering and move forward, it will make the drone lean forward, so when i try to go up, it will literally dive right into the ground
help 2020-04-14 03:50:53 sur e
help 2020-04-14 03:50:54 sure
help 2020-04-14 03:50:59 i would like to i guess
help 2020-04-15 00:31:18 For the past 2 hours, I have been trying to fix my drone. Every time I made it go up, it spins to the right while going up. Not a single person so far has been able to solve this issue.
help 2020-04-15 00:35:03 o wow, thanks for the feedback!
help 2020-04-15 00:35:13 totally gonna help me!
