plane-crazy 2020-04-14 23:49:17 ?????
plane-crazy 2020-04-14 23:47:17 idk what or why it wont stop spinning to the right
plane-crazy 2020-04-14 23:47:03 the mass is completely centered
plane-crazy 2020-04-14 23:45:33 well, the left side of my drone has motors facing front. The other side has motors facing the back. It still keeps spinning
plane-crazy 2020-04-14 23:44:37 right
plane-crazy 2020-04-14 23:44:28 PRT SCR

plane-crazy 2020-04-14 23:42:10 this is the drone I am trying to make. It uses motors below and prop blades. When I activate it to go up, it keeps turning to the right
plane-crazy 2020-04-14 23:35:28 ik how to make the blades and controls, just idk how to stop it from turning
plane-crazy 2020-04-14 23:35:05 shut up
plane-crazy 2020-04-14 23:34:56 well i still aint learning anything
plane-crazy 2020-04-14 23:34:39 i was going to use the controls for my main build
plane-crazy 2020-04-14 23:34:10 it is from a tutorial
plane-crazy 2020-04-14 23:34:05 
plane-crazy 2020-04-14 23:33:11 ???
plane-crazy 2020-04-14 23:31:25 all of the tutorials either have hover pads in em or are outdated
plane-crazy 2020-04-14 23:31:11 i am making a regular drone with blades in each corner
plane-crazy 2020-04-14 23:29:32 i honestly do not know how
plane-crazy 2020-04-14 23:29:26 i have been trying for the last hour using motors, prop blades, and changing up the key binds
plane-crazy 2020-04-14 23:29:05 could u just tell me
plane-crazy 2020-04-14 23:29:02 ?????
plane-crazy 2020-04-14 23:27:03 ???
plane-crazy 2020-04-14 23:26:40 uh how the hell do you make a drone without hover pads?
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 03:14:35 thx
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 03:14:33 nvm
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 03:14:10 how do i edit the angle of motor2?
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 03:13:50 ok
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 03:13:23 what does motor 2 even do?
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 03:12:37 the water mark is from a website that reduces the file size, ignore it
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 03:12:22 so i built a vehicle that makes its wheels go into the car and come out. I am planning on turning it into a hover  car. How do i stop the wheels from extending below the car when i make the wheels go out of the car?
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 23:31:24 how
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 23:28:49 i wanna give it a paint job, just idk what to do to paint it
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 23:28:29 any way i can improve it?
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 23:26:27 how does my Gulfstream G650 look?
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 23:26:09 its good
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 23:26:07 idk
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 23:26:02 good
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 23:25:55 also i did not make the split down the front windows
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 23:25:43 
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 23:25:34 ok so i made the Gulfstream G650 and i would like some criticism on it. Is it good, bad, decent, tell me what you think of it and how i could improve it. The only difference from the real Gulfstream G650 is that theres 4 jets instead of 2.
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 23:22:56 e p i c
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 23:22:51 cool
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 23:22:13 epic
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 23:21:41 the base is good, just the wings need to be more spread out and big.
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 23:21:32 looks good, just the wings need to be bigger
