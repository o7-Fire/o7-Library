bot-central 2019-06-19 13:32:33 Oh for fuck sake
creations-chat 2019-06-19 15:10:23 Grumman J2F Duck coastguard plane (I cant wait to try and get this off the ground...)
creations-chat 2019-06-19 15:41:21 Its slowly being butchered as I try to make it fly
creations-chat 2019-06-19 15:41:32 I can make really nice planes but I hate how underpowered everything is
creations-chat 2019-06-19 16:52:17 You can barely see the plane
creations-chat 2019-06-19 16:54:43 shut up you smell
creations-chat 2019-06-19 16:56:01 How is this downvote worthy
creations-chat 2019-06-19 16:56:27 FUCK I DIDNT MEAN TO DO THAT
creations-chat 2019-06-19 16:57:32 huge planes are annoying to get off the ground
creations-chat 2019-06-19 16:57:47 the entire point of that hurricane was a test of how small I could make a nice and functional plane
creations-chat 2019-06-19 16:57:51 and it flies like a beast
creations-chat 2019-06-19 16:58:30 Its not bad it just looks British
creations-chat 2019-06-19 16:59:08 You dont need to fit massive amounts of detail such as a camo pattern if the plane actually looks how its meant to
creations-chat 2019-06-19 16:59:59 My Grumman Duck is about 290 parts and its like trying to make a 50 tonne block of lead fly
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:00:24 exactly
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:00:47 My Hawker is like 120 parts and I fucking struggled to get that off the ground too
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:00:54 On each of my planes I end up hiding like 5 jets
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:01:19 *Look at all those rockets*
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:01:45 I dont like using rockets because they leave a particle trail, have a bad noise, and end up being too heavy
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:03:07 I have a P38 Lightning with 137 parts, it has two propellors, like 6 jets, and helium too, and it doesnt fly
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:03:29 I have a Hurricane with 110 parts, 1 propeller, 3 jets, 1 thing of helium, and it flies amazingly
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:03:38 what is the logic
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:03:45 and the P38 has like double the control surfaces
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:04:13 You havent even seen the aircraft
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:05:28 I love the game too but everything is so underpowered
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:05:36 it takes like 20 jets to carry 50 parts
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:05:52 and you need about 10x the original amount of control surfaces too
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:06:19 otherwise it has the response time of an arthritic 100 year old tortoise
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:06:35 Because majority of the community make small builds
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:06:46 not everyone likes making 500+ part huge things
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:06:54 when small things fly well, look nice, and are quick to make
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:07:21 Just because you cant make small things or have seen many good small things doesnt mean every small thing is ugly
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:07:55 You got offended quickly
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:09:25 so yes
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:09:25 Well you're yet to show us one of your 'good small things' and you constantly keep dissing small builds and downvoting them
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:09:28 I assume you cant
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:09:47 size doesnt matter as long as you know how to use it
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:09:58 I dont give a shit about challenges
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:10:08 Im about to go eat and I play the game for fun
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:10:16 I make small things because I like making small things
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:10:43 they look satisfying and they fly well and im not amazing at getting things off the ground because I hate rockets
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:11:17 the game's weight system confuses me and everything is horrendously underpowered
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:11:18 so
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:11:39 I dont like them
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:11:49 theyre too powerful and make a god awful noise and the particles are bad
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:15:19 Not everyone likes coating their planes in layers of ugly jets, I try to make my planes look nice and function
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:15:46 Also its not beautiful but I achieved a thing that looks somewhat nice and looks like a Grumman Duck
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:15:51 
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:16:01 MEAN

creations-chat 2019-06-20 00:12:10 Just the sort of central engine idea of the MiG in general
creations-chat 2019-06-20 00:12:32 It started out as a normal I-16
creations-chat 2019-06-20 00:12:45 but then it had bad turning so I added the rear
creations-chat 2019-06-20 00:12:57 then it was slow so I added more engines instead of a prop
creations-chat 2019-06-20 00:13:17 and so on
creations-chat 2019-06-20 00:13:19 and thus
creations-chat 2019-06-20 00:13:52 the IA-167 was born

creations-chat 2019-06-25 00:05:52 Boeing P26A Peashooter with folding wings because why the hecc not
creations-chat 2019-06-25 00:05:56 When folded
creations-chat 2019-06-25 00:06:02 
creations-chat 2019-06-25 00:06:19 Wings drop down, fold under the plane's belly... ideal for carriers I guess
creations-chat 2019-06-25 00:25:46 Turns out putting the wings forward makes you turn really fast and putting them back at an angle makes you go down really quick
creations-chat 2019-06-25 00:26:01 and having your wings forward reduces amount of runway needed
creations-chat 2019-06-25 00:51:21 well my retarded ass didnt realise that and thought it was a miracle so
creations-chat 2019-06-25 00:52:17 ;c sad face people are downvoting

creations-chat 2019-06-25 00:52:42 and my fastest
creations-chat 2019-06-25 00:58:42 Like I said
creations-chat 2019-06-25 00:58:50 its my first folding wing creation
creations-chat 2019-06-25 00:58:57 and the plane itself is fine when it isnt folded
creations-chat 2019-06-25 01:02:31 I struggled enough getting a design which folded inwards nevermind fancy ass half folds and stuff like real life

creations-chat 2019-08-16 01:30:56 its better than the other Phalanx earlier
bot-central 2019-08-16 19:25:30 &suggest ***Cannons*** - People underestimate the use of cannons but lets face it nearly ever WW2 plane and beyond has them
2 blocks long unlike the 1 for gun (entire 2 blocks, not sat in the middle)
5x as powerful as gun
Has ammo
Twice as heavy
Limited to like 4 or something instead of 12 like the guns
Beefy pew sound
like 2 second intervals between each shot, but still automatic, like the gun.
bot-central 2019-08-16 19:25:46 that
bot-central 2019-08-16 19:25:47 didnt work
bot-central 2019-08-16 19:26:26 *That would have been nice to know earlier*
bot-central 2019-08-16 19:26:40 Well no, I already knew, I just thought it changed since you told me to try it myself
