creations-chat 2018-12-30 18:02:31 Epix's Bloxwork blender | EpixFatty311 | 509
- As a matter of fact, it can entertain an entire server
- There are 1x4 wing panels inside that can rotate via motor
-The balls that act as like some fruit you'd put in a blender
- You can't lie, it's fun when you ragdoll inside and get thrown around.
- Glass exterior so you can look at what's going on inside
- Can fit an entire server inside
Cons:
A bit of a frame drop comes in depending on your PC or Mobile device.
creations-chat 2018-12-30 18:20:12 Sandstorm APC - "Armadillo" | EpixFatty311| 291 blocks
- Uses the winters wheels (of course)
- Wheels are surrounded by pretty much what you can call armour
- Has about 5-6 seats
- Has a wing for downforce
- 2 super rocket boosters on each side to support climbing up inclines
- On top, there is a rocket turret that can turn side to side, and up and down
- It's very agile when it comes to making turns
- Pretty much unflippable due to its diameter and weight, unless it got somehow into the air and didn't land correctly
creations-chat 2018-12-30 19:40:29 Roblox brand toilet paper dispenser | EpixFatty311| 603 blocks | Modeller or Inventor rank?

- It actually lets down toilet paper
- Golden Toilet paper holder (Because why not?)
- A big wall I spent forever on
- A big roll of toilet paper that I spent forever on
- Disconnectors are used to show the illusion of the toilet paper coming off the roll
-Non-existent  lag despite the 603 blocks
-I used anchor blocks at the bottom to prevent the wall from tipping over

Cons:
For the current moment, I only made it to where one large piece of toilet paper drops

Note: If you want to see the authenticity that I actually made it, or that it actually drops a piece of toilet paper,
you can join my server and ask for me to do it whenever im in Plane Crazy

&
Im pretty sure no one has ever made a toilet paper dispenser and posted it on this discord, so don't hate on me if someone did.
creations-chat 2018-12-30 19:43:53 It's a gig.

creations-chat 2018-12-30 19:44:13 It was fun making it.
