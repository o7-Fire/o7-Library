creations-chat 2021-06-09 03:20:27 I built that lawnmower back in early 2019. Nothing's changed.

creations-chat 2021-06-09 05:38:16 Sorry man.
creations-chat 2021-06-09 06:15:19 I was bored and decided to make a box full of rockets. We don't need to act like it's a threat to our national security. lol
creations-chat 2021-06-09 06:17:52 I don't care about the hate though. I didn't know you could be blacklisted just for that. It's a creation whether it's trash or not. XD Alright <@!462820100098228224> Maybe. Alright, take care.

creations-chat 2021-06-10 21:24:02 The game is called Plane Crazy, but I don't see people putting wings on their boats.

creations-chat 2021-06-10 23:32:35 I made it in early 2019. It's never changed. I'm just gonna leave it alone. It was mainly for function. I was going to use it for PVP, but never did.
