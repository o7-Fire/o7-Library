creations-chat 2022-01-11 15:28:47 it really wasn't that hard to make, but it still isn't a no-effort build, it uses sparklers with the bases blown off, and it is actually 126 blocks

creations-chat 2022-02-02 04:16:57 It is a debated topic amongst the psychology community, still an uncharted territory in study due to it's such sudden and recent appearance.

creations-chat 2022-02-02 06:41:13 but, deep inside plot number 10, the furthest away from anywhere, arises a new faction: THE DEFAULT faction.  They do not have the appearance or invisible potential of the two glass factions, but they are far tougher, designed for war, they have to hide in the shadows so that they don't get swarmed by glass shredder bugs. They sneak around, destroying strategic locations, like dropping anchor blocks with "Never gonna give you up" radio's attatched to them.

(PC lore part 2 add on more)
creations-chat 2022-02-02 06:57:04 But if only the metal faction had known; in those cities lay a dormant creation, unused since the end of PC1, an ancient creation, still existing in save number 512 of a DEFAULT factions members... A lag machine, as the motor=-locked bomb hits the city it destroys the containment facility for the lag machine, unleashing it upon the world. and the bomber crew can only watch in horror as a knot of ropes, parachutes and springs grow in size from the centre of the city. they see their plane slow down and eventually stop, not continuing forwards, they can't escape it's wrath.
creations-chat 2022-02-02 07:00:10 And then a bacon hair joins, builds the tutorial plane and says "I am pro look at my awessum plane." The End.

creations-chat 2022-02-02 12:25:32 yes but ro-scale gets you more upvotes, and upvotes are the meaning of life, there is no purpose for existing other than squeezing more upvotes out of your build.

events-chat 2022-02-10 10:03:23 and are v-tols allowed?
events-chat 2022-02-10 10:03:54 yep, just rotating the engines using motors
events-chat 2022-02-10 10:04:55 yes but hovering
events-chat 2022-02-10 10:15:36 the yousuf is pretty much a helicopter anyway
events-chat 2022-02-10 10:15:57 slow moving, downward facing weapons, and a turret
events-chat 2022-02-10 10:16:53 are you allowed to build one from scratch that fits the perameters?
events-chat 2022-02-10 10:17:11 ok
events-chat 2022-02-10 10:19:46 and can you have a mix of the optional weapons? like one rocket and one firework
events-chat 2022-02-15 09:12:14 Ok, Defenders have to stay within range of their carrier, the Yousuf can fly slow, especially with modifications (I got it flying as slow as 27), and the Yousuf has a turret, which means it could go really really slow and just shoot the enemy carrier with the turret from outside the defenders range. 

But of course this would displease the almighty gods of PCC, and wouldn't be allowed
events-chat 2022-02-15 09:15:53 .



another genius thought...

There is no rules stating you can't take one of the yousuf's propeller's and strap it to the explosives, making a missile
events-chat 2022-02-15 09:17:45 .


and, then again, you could take the mounted turret on the yousuf and attach it to the missile, then remove the bomb, or add the bombs to disconnectors, making a yousuf, in the yousuf, that is disconnected from the yousuf
events-chat 2022-02-15 09:18:25 or 6 if you really wanted to, one for each propeller
events-chat 2022-02-15 09:19:02 same with the doof, that has 2 props, double doof
events-chat 2022-02-15 09:20:03 🧠 📈
events-chat 2022-02-15 09:23:58 ok, the final idea, make a 360 degree thrust vectoring on the yousuf props, and rotate them to face upwards, so the yousuf hovers like a rocket does, then using rockets underneath it, tilt the yousuf around to aim... now it has become a giant sky turret with rockets!
events-chat 2022-02-16 07:47:41 I have had another stroke of genius, anchor blocks aren't banned... 

So, attach your plane onto an anchor block using motor2 and you instantly have a sky turret from any plane that is anchored in place
events-chat 2022-02-16 07:48:16 and nor is helium banned
events-chat 2022-02-16 07:48:35 you could just "modify" a plane to become a zeppelin
events-chat 2022-02-16 08:50:27 👍
events-chat 2022-02-16 09:10:56 fun fact: that is an estimate of the max speed not a rule for the max speed
and if it was a rule then why would it be between two numbers? why not just one number stating the max speed
and why have any amount of max engines at all, why not just limit people to the speed that they can have with that build and then the engines are decided by them

and also if I misunderstood your message and you were talking about it as an estimate then why did you say that?
events-chat 2022-02-16 10:57:02 ok
events-chat 2022-02-16 10:59:29 you can delete it if you are going to
events-chat 2022-02-16 10:59:49 I understand why you dislike the build, it is not in the theme of the event
events-chat 2022-02-16 22:11:16 A serious question; when in the rules it says no motor-lock, is that no motor-locks only for pulling motors in by half a block or no motor-lock at all?

Is it allowed to have a powered locked motor that has been rotated so that it isn't pulled in by half a block?
events-chat 2022-02-16 22:24:58 ok thanks

events-chat 2022-02-20 03:08:41 ok I was kinda thinking like a 10 minute build time to build something then you battle, which would be cool, but that idea doesn't seem good
events-chat 2022-02-20 03:11:55 I have an idea for an event, but I don't know how much this will be liked

Sailboat races, you build a tiller steering sailboat (like these two: https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/384025409945337856/944457767647854603 and https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/384025409945337856/944044368065605642)
then you have to do laps around the water area; weaving in between the jumps, and just going around, and whoever gets to the end first wins
capped speed to, so the main part of it is being good at steering the boat and having a good steering boat.

events-chat 2022-02-20 03:22:45 either it is just an event about pushing the other opponent or it is a car battle, that is what the cow battles would be

events-chat 2022-02-20 03:24:09 just an airship battle but with weird builds
events-chat 2022-02-20 03:25:03 that is just dum
events-chat 2022-02-20 03:26:14 ok, so each player has a few explosive blocks on it, and I imagine if it is a cow battle then you would only ram the opponent once, so they would all go off at once

then what if you don't destroy the opponent in your one go?

creations-chat 2022-03-25 23:42:02 you physically can't downvote the Tiger-1 tank... that is why it is doing well

 MEME_LEGEND, that is a bad tank build, the barrel is waaay too wide for a light tank,and the shape is unrealistic, also those rollers are too big
creations-chat 2022-03-25 23:52:58 rollers are the cylinders in the tread that the tread rolls around, and it seems that you have used wheel 2x2 2 for fake rollers, unless you are making it a wheeled vehicle in which case then it is fine.

Shape still matters, the design looks bad, unrealistic tank
the front shouldn't be flat it should curve down slightly and the turret should be further forwards
creations-chat 2022-03-25 23:58:05 not the front front, but the area infront of the turret is completely flat (horizontal), even the ebr has slopes going up to the turret. and if the turret is too far back for you to make a slope go back there then move it forwards https://thedailybounce.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/WorldOfTanks_h202018-11-262013-41-08-28.png

9 cutters allowed in the head (mouth)
all movement (thrusters) must be built into the  head and the first segment
No hover glitch allowed
your snake must be longer than 1 plot

if you loose your snakes head you die

thanks
creations-chat 2022-04-23 11:13:13 Wow, ok... I did the maths and that wingspan is the exact ratio that it should be

well actually a little bit longer than it should be (it should be 26.267 blocks)

it does appear too short tho, so for anyone who hasn't realised it is the right length they will probably downvote

events-chat 2022-04-30 23:10:45 ... I will explain this

mauve had asked the question "what are you on?" intending it to be "what drugs are you on"

and you replied with mobile, which is taking the question in a different meaning, which I found funny because it is a stupid thing to have done

now I don't care that you are on mobile, I would have had the same  reaction if you said "laptop"
events-chat 2022-04-30 23:11:03 now stop talking about it

events-chat 2022-05-01 01:08:06 <@466793357318815744> I would agree, you should max out the tip speed of spinners, mine goes over 4,000 sps (4000fps (feet per second), or 2727 mph or MACH 2.2!)
the actual show maxes out tip speed to 250mph, but because of the increased scale maybe max it out to 2500mph or maybe 1000mph or even 500mph

events-chat 2022-05-01 04:36:28 if more than half the weight of your bot is unable to move then you are out, that is the rules (I think) there was a team with 5 mini-bots, no main bots and if they lost 3 of there bots then they are all dead

events-chat 2022-05-06 07:52:42 is the use of gears allowed? as in, you use a speed 40 power 5 motor, and you gear it up so that your weapon spins and the equivalent of a speed 200 power 1 motor?

events-chat 2022-05-06 12:27:49 but you can't have 4 motors powering your spinner
events-chat 2022-05-06 12:28:07 only 1 motor, to limit the fling, I don't care if it means your spinner sucks, mine takes 25 seconds to get up to speed now
events-chat 2022-05-06 12:28:41 and it looses all speed upon collision
events-chat 2022-05-06 12:30:33 idk, it doesn't seem to be in the rules but I think it is implied with 
**Change #2:** Your weapon motor torque should be like 5-ish or less

because if you have more than 1 motor is is technically more than 5 torque (unless they are stacked then it would be more than 40 speed; in violation of **Change #1:** Max speed on weapon motors for spinners is 40)

and also he told me personally in VIP 1 when I was testing my bot to unpower 2 of my 3 motors powering the spinner
events-chat 2022-05-06 12:31:15 specifically because he didn't want me to be winning simply because everyone gets flung from my spinner since that makes for boring fights

bug-reports 2022-05-19 06:48:59 It seems like it is to do with the air resistance script for the wing panels when the explosives blow them up or something, I am not rickje so I wouldn’t know but roblox probably updated

creations-chat 2022-05-27 05:53:31 they are right, you should just make better builds, my first few builds got horrible downvotes, since then I haven't had any negative score posts, I don't even make big things I mean this got 82 upvotes (back when 100 was incredible)
creations-chat 2022-05-27 06:03:48 needs more than 300 upvotes

<@297120728342331392> since when?
creations-chat 2022-05-27 06:08:11 not if you are building it, don't go for HOF, those builds take months to make; go for a positive upvote count if you are new, I have been in this server for over 2 years and I have nothing over even 3k blocks (my biggest build is from the battlebot event, that got me the event winner role)


<@673249949344989203> the first one looks like a shredder bug, the second has exposed propellers, and the last looks decent, but screenshot your photos, don't take them from a phone of your screen, I can't see them properly and it is an eyesore to look at, so screenshot them please
creations-chat 2022-05-27 06:10:32 150, as I just learnt (150 score, upvotes - downvotes = score)

creations-chat 2022-05-27 06:23:10 they have to DM a mod, the mod then puts the build up for voting by the VIP's, these people then vote on wether the build should be put into <#627195143040139264> if it does not get passed, then it does not get in, not everything gets into <#627195143040139264>

help 2022-06-08 11:03:01 late reply but:
what is  the scale? that could be star citizen sized nova tank size or a Bob semple sized tank
why are the cheeks (turret front) so flat, that tank has a small cheek angle of ~15  degrees which only increases effective thickness by 1.03 times  (I did the trigonometry for it)

help 2022-06-08 11:05:00 what?
help 2022-06-08 11:06:04 so from my understanding, you are asking how to imagine  a 4d world?
help 2022-06-08 11:06:44 It bends down
help 2022-06-08 11:07:53 oh ok, well spacetime doesn't actually "bend" in the common sense of that word, that is just a representation of how to imagine how gravity works
help 2022-06-08 11:09:37 are you talking about this? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTY1Kje0yLg?
help 2022-06-08 11:10:50 yeah it doesn't bend, and even it space-time was bending there isn't any external 'gravity' sort of force that pulls everything  down into the folds of the space-time fabric
help 2022-06-08 11:11:06 that is simply a way to visualise it
help 2022-06-08 11:11:52 cap
help 2022-06-08 11:13:12 it is a particle that gives everything mass, the Higgs-boson particle, these particles  are attracted to each other, which makes gravity, I don't know much about sub-atomic particles but that is what I think it is

creations-chat 2022-06-11 05:29:26 I was making a tiny f-15 out of piston locked wing-lights that would be smaller than your arm, it was going to be called ro-scale

creations-chat 2022-06-24 13:47:51 it is always the unique and/or meme builds that get high upvotes (for lower skill), and so a lot of people get their expert designer ranks that way, rather than a jet or tank (really common builds) that is just good quality

the-dump 2022-08-28 00:48:00 two of them are from the last egg hunt, and one was free
the-dump 2022-08-28 00:49:50 also it got those but it didn't notice that I have Rodan's Head, which isn't very furry like, but still more furry like than any of those
the-dump 2022-08-28 01:11:44 just search up furry detector

the-dump 2022-10-05 23:02:51 Go back through your badges, right to the start of the creation of your Roblox account, what were the first few games you played.
mine were:
1 Build a boat for treasure
2 Vehicle Simulator
3 Broken Bones
4 Plane Crazy
5 Elemental Battlegrounds
6 Ice-cream Van Simulator
in that order

just curious what stuff people have

events-chat 2022-11-11 22:01:04 does it have to start inside the build limit or be inside the build limit throughout the fight, or just be able to fit inside the build limit?

events-chat 2022-11-11 22:09:27 ok
events-chat 2022-11-11 22:17:09 rbk, so you made a few new rules last tournament because I had a giant spinner that would send you flying at 4k speed, are you going to put those rules back in?
events-chat 2022-11-11 22:17:39 also I am allowed to participate? because I won the last battlebot tournament
events-chat 2022-11-11 22:20:25 oh and are wings and helium banned?
events-chat 2022-11-11 23:41:57 anyone who wants to test do it in VIP 2, VIP one has big ships and is really laggy
events-chat 2022-11-12 01:01:50 <@434843195025653762> yes that design was flawed remember I won the last battlebot tournament, and it took me three completed battlebots until I made my first good one
events-chat 2022-11-12 01:03:49 things that would help: thicken the supports, add much more weight, your main spinner is blocked by your wheels so move it infront of your wheels, smaller less obvious wheels (rbk's design can get away with it because he has super thick wheels) and make the spinner heavier, almost all of my wins came from launching enemies
events-chat 2022-11-12 01:06:12 I'm not rbk but I have seen some interesting designs. There was one guy with a whole  bunch of mini bots each with only 1 cutter, they were ineffective and were destroyed easily, his main bot had no weapons.
events-chat 2022-11-12 01:07:11 no
events-chat 2022-11-12 01:07:13 he did that
events-chat 2022-11-12 01:07:57 I was also thinking of a design where I would fling these all over the arena (they are called czech hedgehogs)
events-chat 2022-11-12 01:08:25 due to motor torque changes I couldn't get a good launching mechanism
events-chat 2022-11-12 01:08:40 but it wouldn't have worked anyway
events-chat 2022-11-12 01:08:57 but if I can make a wall of them then my eenemy can't pass
events-chat 2022-11-12 01:09:22 and dropping them means I hvae to move around rather than placeing them anywhere in the arena
events-chat 2022-11-12 01:09:48 🧠
events-chat 2022-11-12 01:10:47 and not a dum design because it would work in actual battlebots, but anythign that requires enemies to go up a wedge on the front, builds don't interact with each other that well and they will probably just push you back or go through you
