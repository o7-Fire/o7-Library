bug-reports 2020-04-17 13:07:33 as soon as I start painting my building, I get this error of the Internet connection. This is already 4 times in a row. I checked the Internet connection, but everything was in order. This is something with plane crazy or roblox. and too much ping plane crazy when I paint the building. Auto save buildings still do not work. I am building a tank and I canâ€™t finish building it, constantly this disconnected after which I rejoin and see that nothing was saved. I have already spent 4 hours on this f ***** g tank. correct all these errors.
