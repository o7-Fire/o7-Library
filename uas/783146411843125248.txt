the-dump 2023-04-13 20:56:49 Su57 garbage, it has a bigger radar signature than a prop aircraft of the same size during ww2
the-dump 2023-04-13 20:57:22 You are not asking right
the-dump 2023-04-13 20:57:29 You must be trying to argue rn
the-dump 2023-04-13 20:57:34 Its official
the-dump 2023-04-13 20:57:41 It is bad
the-dump 2023-04-13 20:59:28 Whay
the-dump 2023-04-13 20:59:30 Why
the-dump 2023-04-13 20:59:39 Bruh
the-dump 2023-04-13 20:59:48 Okay let me retype it just a sec
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:03:22 First thing:
They are stuck with 90's production line aircraft manifacturing, and european to add to that at best (very important) 

-europe never did their own actually stealthy jet fighter aircraft on a mass scale

-russia can GET THE PLANS from hacked files and stuff like the plans to know WHAT THEY NEED TO DO and the specifications of the very very very small margines of engineering contraints they would need to respect. Thing is, tthey dont have the manifacturing equipment for that
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:03:46 Simple
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:04:54 So like it doesnt matter if on paper the su-57 is good or not, irl its a fancy 4th gen jetfighter
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:05:30 Reality aint a video game
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:07:25 American planes with radars did have accounters with it and like i stated it had an horibbly big radar cross section
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:07:41 We talking detecting it before you can see it with anything
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:09:02 They crashed a jet into a drone that cost half the price of said jet. You said?
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:09:30 Im pretty sure it was a su-57
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:09:48 Not like america is falling behind russia in anything
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:09:59 If Anything the russian are better than the usa is corruption
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:10:03 And that they are epic at it
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:10:45 Didnt state it was that accounter you dumb ass
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:11:00 I stated that russia flies their jet and do dangerous stuff with them all the time
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:11:15 Just the first time a crash like this is actually virale
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:11:46 Are you dumb
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:12:25 A plane is fragile that jet must have crashed too, they are so poor they are ready to waste it for a drone with 1980's tech. Wake tf up
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:12:50 Like bruh
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:13:03 Ik im like brain dead rn and cant type for shit
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:13:07 Slept 2h
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:13:25 Thats good for the scrap yard
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:14:14 Oh okay so because war thunder model of the aircraft is broken, and that idk a modern jet can fly with a single wing, you seriously think russia has great jets
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:14:22 When its 3 decades behind even china
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:14:28 Are you mentally challenge
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:15:22 The fuselage is compremised it was burned and detoriated its composition changed
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:15:27 They fixed it maybe
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:15:33 But the usa would NEVER
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:15:35 DO THAT
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:15:54 My idole
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:16:55 Tbh the warthog is shit too
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:17:04 And the usaf actually said so too
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:18:43 Like the only REASON why they keep operating them its that its a good cas aircraft if you have total control of the sky, which the usa with the biggest airforce in the wold by a large margine doesn't lack, otherwise, the warthog is slower than a late ww2 piston prop fighter
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:18:51 To say it sucks to begin with
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:18:56 Is a understatment
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:19:06 An helicopter does almost a better job
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:20:05 They dont, the friendly fire with the warthog was real bad (not as bad as some people pretend but still)
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:20:51 A plane was legit designed around that dumb ass gun
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:21:00 Thats the f problem with the warthog
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:21:10 The whole problem problem about it
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:21:13 Is that
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:21:36 Canada
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:23:21 Yeah lets just say that you are incredibly stupid
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:23:30 Lets put it this way
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:24:06 Np
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:24:41 We use all short of junk added to most modern jet fighters thx our primister for that cluster f
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:25:04 No
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:26:20 We had our jet fighters a while back, but like many thing went south including the usa having much bigger compagnies so they crushed the competition instantly when they say we had very good jets coming out
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:26:38 <@750066581874147389> now you know why
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:26:54 And we produce weapons for other country then our own
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:26:57 Thats how stupid
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:27:00 This is
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:27:33 There was one that could go like mach 2 or some bs
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:27:49 From avro yes
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:28:24 It had a sub in canada
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:28:34 But were fairly disconected
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:28:49 It was because ww2
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:28:57 It basically became its own thing slowly
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:29:42 Thing is that canada was manifacturing power house after ww2
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:30:15 Trudeau
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:30:19 <:clueless:942802644043464734>
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:30:30 -make canada indebt like anything else before
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:30:56 -fuck the military
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:31:46 We sent a good portions of our leopards 2
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:32:15 <:ch_politetea:782976917362966570>
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:32:39 Again you play too much war thunder
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:32:58 It has a package just like the tusk one and actually
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:33:11 The leopard is much MUCH MUCH MUCH MORE MODULAR than the abram
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:33:24 Some abrams were lost too before
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:33:29 Thats a leopard 2a4
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:33:33 Not a 2a5
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:33:34 Also
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:33:41 Thatw as probably the turkish
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:33:46 They used some like shit
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:33:54 Infront of infantry in urban combat
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:33:58 It didnt go too well
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:34:02 Their bad
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:34:06 Not the tank
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:34:18 The abram is a tank
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:34:29 Thx for clarifying this to me
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:35:03 Much
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:35:07 MUCH BETTER
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:35:16 IT WAS DESIGNED from the ground up
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:35:24 To fight in those conditions
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:35:29 Unlike the abram
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:35:42 The abram is more like
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:35:50 Gasoline ungry
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:35:53 <:clueless:942802644043464734>
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:36:03 And need insane air coverage
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:36:39 Like i stated the leopard is much more modular than the abram, it is meant to be buyer friendly
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:36:52 The swidish legit added like 49mm to the top of their tank
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:37:29 Top down attack on any thank that currently exist are deadly
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:37:32 Welcome irl
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:37:46 Most modern leopards have the trophy active protection system
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:37:57 And tusk equivalent and more package
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:38:03 Atgm wont touch it
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:38:47 Still waiting for it to be in the german tech tree in war thunder
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:38:53 It will be so broken
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:38:57 <:clueless:942802644043464734>
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:40:03 The leopard 2 pso is in the game filed thought
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:40:23 Meant for urban combat
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:40:29 Including a shorter barrel
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:43:00 
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:43:10 Feel the german steel
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:43:48 2010 pic so yes many 2a7+ are being and are produced already
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:43:59 It aint meant for urban combat thought
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:44:03 Unlike the PSO
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:44:20 
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:49:18 Yes
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:49:26 And turkey lost a bunch like morons
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:49:34 Used them as some short of wonder weapon
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:49:49 And trew them infront of everything
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:49:58 Into a very crowded city

the-dump 2023-04-23 00:46:15 So spanish
the-dump 2023-04-23 00:46:20 It aint
the-dump 2023-04-23 00:46:45 Portugues and spanish have SOME similar words idk if you knew
the-dump 2023-04-23 00:46:54 But they are very different in general
the-dump 2023-04-23 00:47:03 They just are similar in the way they work
the-dump 2023-04-23 00:47:39 Phoque (legit spelled like fuck in french) is seal in french
the-dump 2023-04-23 00:47:45 So basically <@1031276320769970227>
the-dump 2023-04-23 00:48:11 Phoque can be either a fucking seal if it is coming out of a french person
the-dump 2023-04-23 00:48:15 Or legit fuck

the-dump 2023-05-02 19:27:01 Stop another one of the blood vains in my head might blow up
the-dump 2023-05-02 19:27:16 So shit
the-dump 2023-05-02 19:28:13 How is that a fighter, how did a car compagny came about to make a space ship, tf
the-dump 2023-05-02 19:28:20 Originality -10
the-dump 2023-05-02 19:28:39 They look like clown cars
the-dump 2023-05-02 19:29:18 thats good
the-dump 2023-05-02 19:29:45 Everything else is like if i tried to build about good looking and fidnt even try when im already shit
the-dump 2023-05-02 19:29:52 No insult but it is bad
the-dump 2023-05-02 19:29:59 Even for my shit standard
the-dump 2023-05-02 19:39:28 Most future spaceship will msot likely feature much less colors than your spacecrafts, like in a lot of science fiction, for various reasons, the following mainly:

-theres no need to paint thermal tiles and anything that will be exposed to the atmospheric reentry tempereratures optained by a spacecraft
- despite certain surfaces not being exposed to those extreme temperature, most spacecraft are painted entirelly white or not at all and remain the color of their metal strucrture
the-dump 2023-05-02 19:39:49 This is due to the fact that well they are exposed to sun light
the-dump 2023-05-02 19:39:54 ALOT MORE THAN YOU AND ME
the-dump 2023-05-02 19:40:07 and any other color would absorb instead of reflect
the-dump 2023-05-02 19:40:11 Which aint the best
the-dump 2023-05-02 19:40:15 In a vacume
the-dump 2023-05-02 19:41:15 Conclusion: in the future we might see more dark, black grey ships, but then again they will most likely stick with this simple design for the color choices
the-dump 2023-05-02 19:41:25 For the reasons stated
the-dump 2023-05-02 19:41:39 So the dark tone would be the materials themselves
the-dump 2023-05-02 19:41:43 Not a paint
the-dump 2023-05-02 19:42:54 "Yesnt"
