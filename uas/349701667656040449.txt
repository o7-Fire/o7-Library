bug-reports 2021-08-23 21:24:33 Bruh all my builds require getting out of a chair and getting into another because they are mouse controlled, I literally can’t use any of my builds until they fix it….
bug-reports 2021-08-23 21:27:33 Ok I found a temporary fix to the bug, once you spawn in, press ragdoll and you should be able to sit
bug-reports 2021-08-23 21:39:21 There’s a temporary fix to it, look what I said above
bug-reports 2021-08-23 21:40:29 <@!700863951004762213> <@!707177889094697040>  once you spawn in, press ragdoll and get back up, then you should be able to sit down
bug-reports 2021-08-23 21:52:17 <@!700863951004762213> yeah I know but at least there’s a temporary fix. There usually isn’t with most bugs
creations-chat 2021-08-25 00:15:48 what can I improve? it preforms well but i, not very satisfied with the looks
creations-chat 2021-08-25 00:17:52 ok, i would like to keep the suspention cuz its supposed to be a bush plane, should I just try to thing the main silver part?   could you dm me a picture of yours? weasle?
creations-chat 2021-08-26 04:40:18 How's it lookin so far?
creations-chat 2021-08-26 04:48:55 what does wedgy mean
help 2021-08-26 22:32:17 im making an airbus baluga, for the main wheels how do I add the rotating shocks where the back wheels hit first and rotate while landing?
creations-chat 2021-08-26 22:33:54 how do I make the back wheels rotate when they hit the ground?
creations-chat 2021-08-26 22:36:07 no, like on a real plane, the back wheels hit and then the entire thing as a whole rotates foward and then the front wheels hit. its hard to explain
creations-chat 2021-08-26 22:40:50 yes, thankyou
creations-chat 2021-08-26 22:44:09 is there a way to add suspention so they have a little resistance? I think that may be a little too conplicated tho
creations-chat 2021-08-26 23:06:22 they were the same on both sides, ive made a lot of changes in the past 15 minutes tho
creations-chat 2021-08-27 03:28:47 how is it possible to even make this mistake..... im dumb
creations-chat 2021-08-27 04:02:12 does anyone have any suggestions on what to put in my beluga? I made the vehicle that carries the part, I just dont know what to make for it
creations-chat 2021-08-27 04:04:52 I guess I could fit that
