bug-reports 2022-12-08 03:00:02 I’m not a mod, but I do play on mobile so I know the mechanics when going up and down, so it’s basically simulating irl plane controls which is where every time you put it up the control surfaces go down as if you are going down, and vice versa but where’s the vertical stabilizer? If the thing on the back is it then that’s something else
