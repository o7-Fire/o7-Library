plane-crazy 2020-07-04 15:33:23 What do ballet blocks do
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 01:05:27 Will rickje add missile lock on the missiles?
plane-crazy 2020-06-24 08:29:40 When will crashing be a thing
plane-crazy 2020-06-23 01:21:41 Can anyone send me a good video
plane-crazy 2020-06-23 01:21:15 How do you make a swashplate for helicopters
plane-crazy 2020-06-23 01:13:00 Because co pilots are renewable
plane-crazy 2020-06-23 01:12:50 Build an ejector seat for the main pilot
plane-crazy 2020-06-23 01:10:20 So that’s the reason I want seats to have a compact parachute built in
plane-crazy 2020-06-23 01:09:55 Because the co pilot seat is touching the motor for my cockpit
plane-crazy 2020-06-23 01:08:18 And I have an f15 strike Eagle
plane-crazy 2020-06-23 01:08:08 Well I do
plane-crazy 2020-06-23 01:07:16 Like a custom half engine
plane-crazy 2020-06-23 01:07:07 Should rickje make the chairs have a little engine on the bottom and a compact parachute
plane-crazy 2020-06-22 19:14:17 He might make his own outlines
plane-crazy 2020-06-22 19:14:08 I know
plane-crazy 2020-06-22 19:12:08 And we could add outlines on certain blocks
plane-crazy 2020-06-22 19:11:58 If rickje adds lines back it would be cool if he could make it so we can color the outlines
plane-crazy 2020-06-22 19:06:21 Add 4 towers like that
plane-crazy 2020-06-22 19:06:06 No just don’t add 2 towers that are taller than all the others and look exactly the same
plane-crazy 2020-06-22 19:03:31 2001
plane-crazy 2020-06-22 19:02:51 From the month of setember
plane-crazy 2020-06-22 19:02:32 They would reenact a certain event
plane-crazy 2020-06-22 19:01:52 Should they add towns and cities if they were to make a new map
plane-crazy 2020-06-22 19:01:02 Like it snaps onto it
plane-crazy 2020-06-22 19:00:57 Which you can place things on halfblocks
plane-crazy 2020-06-22 19:00:11 What about a triple ejector rack
plane-crazy 2020-06-22 18:59:21 For bombs
plane-crazy 2020-06-22 18:59:18 Should I suggest ejector racks
plane-crazy 2020-06-22 18:30:50 What’s vip 1
plane-crazy 2020-06-22 18:12:14 It’s been there along time
plane-crazy 2020-06-22 18:12:06 Gotta config
plane-crazy 2020-06-22 18:11:43 <@!424656494949040129> there already are camera key ones
plane-crazy 2020-06-01 05:53:47 I love how when I put Maj. Justin H “Sweeper” is fine on my plane but when I put Maj. Justin H “Ricemen” it censors
plane-crazy 2020-06-01 05:52:15 Font*
plane-crazy 2020-06-01 05:52:08 That’s where don’t color comes in
plane-crazy 2020-06-01 05:50:39 <@!224513422161739776> try saying “the Second World War”
plane-crazy 2020-06-01 05:49:45 Rice man is censored
plane-crazy 2020-06-01 05:49:04 It filters “I”
plane-crazy 2020-06-01 05:48:58 It happens
plane-crazy 2020-05-30 05:55:06 Nvm I am stupid
plane-crazy 2020-05-30 05:50:11 it*
plane-crazy 2020-05-30 05:50:09 I never happens
plane-crazy 2020-05-30 05:50:05 why do I lag when I activate my plane
plane-crazy 2020-05-30 04:45:33 No mechanisms
plane-crazy 2020-05-30 04:45:23 he just filled an area of his truck with bombs
plane-crazy 2020-05-30 04:45:03 I was in build mode
plane-crazy 2020-05-30 04:44:59 no
plane-crazy 2020-05-30 04:44:49 he was trying to bomb me with a truck
plane-crazy 2020-05-30 04:44:39 wait I'm in a f-15 strike eagle
plane-crazy 2020-05-30 04:44:25 An a F-15 strike eagle
plane-crazy 2020-05-30 04:43:55 what?
plane-crazy 2020-05-30 04:43:36 he ended up bombing himself XD
plane-crazy 2020-05-30 04:43:28 with the truck
plane-crazy 2020-05-30 04:43:26 he tried to bomb me
plane-crazy 2020-05-30 04:41:13 nothing a normal truck'
plane-crazy 2020-05-30 04:40:51 a truck with no weaponry
plane-crazy 2020-05-30 04:38:49 He tried a comeback when I didn't take him seriously
plane-crazy 2020-05-30 04:37:42 because it's considered "bullying" when you kill someone in pvp
plane-crazy 2020-05-30 04:36:39 some little kid got mad at me
plane-crazy 2020-05-30 01:34:36 what
plane-crazy 2020-05-30 01:29:28 burner*
plane-crazy 2020-05-30 01:29:25 anyone know how to make a compact after bruner
plane-crazy 2020-05-29 21:56:13 I won’t be able to join you since I’m with my family
plane-crazy 2020-05-29 21:53:09 Or try and make custom control surfaces
plane-crazy 2020-05-29 21:52:48 Because maybe the thrust imbalance, where the wing and control surfaces are
plane-crazy 2020-05-29 21:52:06 <@!282973317202313217>
plane-crazy 2020-05-29 21:50:57 How tall is your plane
plane-crazy 2020-05-29 21:43:55 anyone know how to make the 1 by 2 after burner
plane-crazy 2020-05-29 21:41:27 yep
plane-crazy 2020-05-29 21:40:05 mostly around 80 fps
plane-crazy 2020-05-29 21:39:35 but when I'm building I get a tad over a hundred fps
plane-crazy 2020-05-29 21:39:18 around it
plane-crazy 2020-05-29 21:38:21 it happens when I fly my frames just drop to 30
plane-crazy 2020-05-29 21:37:58 aero*
plane-crazy 2020-05-29 21:37:51 I'm aeornautical engineer 2
plane-crazy 2020-05-29 21:36:35 I'm not an expert rank
plane-crazy 2020-05-29 21:35:40 I have a good pc
plane-crazy 2020-05-29 21:35:35 what is vip 1
plane-crazy 2020-05-29 21:34:22 getting low framrate when I fly
plane-crazy 2020-05-29 21:34:14 why is plane crazy so laggy
plane-crazy 2020-05-29 02:21:23 I need to know when I activate it I see no difference
plane-crazy 2020-05-29 02:21:13 what does fixed do on smoke
plane-crazy 2020-05-29 02:08:14 Same
plane-crazy 2020-05-29 02:07:39 what does fixed do on the smoke
plane-crazy 2020-05-29 01:54:32 am I right
plane-crazy 2020-05-29 01:54:29 Feminists
plane-crazy 2020-05-29 01:45:14 I think they didn't speak english or are just little 4 yearolds
plane-crazy 2020-05-29 01:45:01 bruh no thanks
plane-crazy 2020-05-29 01:43:40 I had 2 people so I black listed them 1 left but before they all ekpt jumping against the barrier to get in
plane-crazy 2020-05-29 01:35:03 This person keeps waiting for me to come out of my plot
plane-crazy 2020-05-28 19:05:26 Man it's totinos
plane-crazy 2020-05-28 06:11:43 An f-15E strike eagle
plane-crazy 2020-05-28 06:10:48 I said I built it on my own but he doesn’t believe me
plane-crazy 2020-05-28 06:10:34 Because some dude asked what tutorial I use
plane-crazy 2020-05-28 06:10:01 Is using a blue print considered a tutorial
plane-crazy 2020-05-28 02:45:29 <@!400465835845615616> I managed to fix the rocking I switched 2 super rcoekts with jet engines and added a few things to the back
plane-crazy 2020-05-27 23:56:11 Roger that
plane-crazy 2020-05-27 23:34:58 that's why I want Rickje to make it a tad stronger
plane-crazy 2020-05-27 23:34:24 but the motor 2 gets pushed down by the wings when going at 400 or above
plane-crazy 2020-05-27 23:34:04 it helpes my plane fly
plane-crazy 2020-05-27 23:34:01 
plane-crazy 2020-05-27 16:32:15 My phone has sinned, it doesn’t think shrek is a word
plane-crazy 2020-05-27 16:31:46 Shrek*
plane-crazy 2020-05-27 16:31:29 And shred
plane-crazy 2020-05-27 16:31:26 Isn’t that some video about the new speakers
plane-crazy 2020-05-27 15:35:41 Since it constantly wobbles when I go up and down to fast
plane-crazy 2020-05-27 15:35:23 Can rickje  make the motor 2 a bit tougher?
plane-crazy 2020-05-27 02:21:56 Is spawn camping against the rules?
plane-crazy 2020-05-26 02:31:14 how do you do the motor after burner
plane-crazy 2020-05-25 05:47:01 Should Stalling be a thing in the game?
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 04:26:05 using helium and hover blocks are considered cheating to me
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 04:22:54 because the outer pylons are air to air
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 04:22:40 the inner missiles and bombs are fine
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 04:22:31 missiles
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 04:22:27 The outer missiles are should be the custom
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 04:21:42 I say the "custom guided missiles" are basiucally cruise missiles
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 04:00:21 have the missiles drop from gravity then activate
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 04:00:00 I wonder if rickje can do a little animation for the missiles
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 03:54:20 who does the scripting for the game?
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 03:20:51 F
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 03:20:05 can we get a moment of silence for the magnet drive
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 03:19:52 F
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 03:18:51 lol
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 03:18:03 kinda think he plays adopt me
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 03:17:39 because he wanted me to add a seat'
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 03:17:30 I said no to somekid now he just spammed plz
plane-crazy 2020-05-15 20:08:02 Go with rice farmer
plane-crazy 2020-05-15 20:07:57 Nah
plane-crazy 2020-05-15 20:07:36 I’m on the ground and my desk is on the ground so it must be human
plane-crazy 2020-05-03 22:09:11 Change my mind
plane-crazy 2020-05-03 22:09:02 If Rick were to add flares for planes he would need to make the missiles lock on from a farther range
plane-crazy 2020-05-02 23:48:41 will there be a new and bigger map?
plane-crazy 2020-04-23 23:52:57 what's the point of a paint block?
plane-crazy 2020-04-23 23:31:28 For more detail on a plane you have to increase the planes size
plane-crazy 2020-04-23 23:28:23 not new blocks
plane-crazy 2020-04-23 23:28:18 idk paint issues and stuff
plane-crazy 2020-04-23 23:27:35 yep
plane-crazy 2020-04-23 23:20:54 ?
plane-crazy 2020-04-23 23:20:52 what if it's like a small plane>
plane-crazy 2020-04-23 23:20:18 instead of having that halfblock be poking out
plane-crazy 2020-04-23 23:20:05 because it would be cool
plane-crazy 2020-04-23 23:19:53 I wonder why there's no landing gear down
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 01:51:49 what'sm with the thrusters making the hwubbbah hwubbanhhjafuh
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 03:54:08 Wdym <@!437078588701933568>
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 03:49:19 <@!437078588701933568> the map was made 13 days ago
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 03:47:14 Plus I kinda do think there’s more can be added towards the map
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 03:43:48 Mad attacks video?
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 03:43:37 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h-rnMwdA5U is this a hint of a new map?
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 22:34:33 if I want a faster explosion have it lower or higher?
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 22:33:43 what does impact speed do on an explosive block?
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 00:43:20 control surfaces*
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 00:42:59 what determins if the wing panel goes up or down with your mouse?
plane-crazy 2020-04-14 18:06:28 Pretty good
plane-crazy 2020-04-14 18:06:18 I spawn on my plot panels are fine spawn at airport panels are inverted and can’t fly my plane
plane-crazy 2020-04-14 18:05:34 What’s with the control panels inverting randomly?
plane-crazy 2020-04-12 23:43:38 the best way to make a seat ejection system ina 1x3 space
plane-crazy 2020-04-12 00:14:51 now it's not
plane-crazy 2020-04-12 00:14:45 and that before it was just working fine
plane-crazy 2020-04-12 00:14:15 what's with the control surfaces going down when I move my mouse up?
plane-crazy 2020-04-12 00:08:06 I'll help upvote
plane-crazy 2020-04-12 00:04:07 i get why now
plane-crazy 2020-04-12 00:04:04 yeah...
plane-crazy 2020-04-12 00:03:48 has Rickje thought about expanding the map and adding cities?
plane-crazy 2020-03-07 01:21:40 Man I wish they made a diving animation while falling
