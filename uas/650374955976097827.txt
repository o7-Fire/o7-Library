creations-chat 2020-11-24 03:09:03 I feel like the back half is a little too big, it's extremely wide compared to the front

But I'm no plane expert so don't take my opinion for granted
creations-chat 2020-11-24 03:12:37 I probably shouldn't judge though since it's better than what I'll ever build

Same, I'll see really good creations get downvotes and it confuses me
