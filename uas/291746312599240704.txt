the-dump 2019-08-08 21:34:18 although  therare sepots where more oxygen are at
the-dump 2019-08-08 21:34:36 though i would have to agree with the tanks
the-dump 2019-08-08 21:35:25 flame go up because of the combusting materials
the-dump 2019-08-08 21:35:46 if u use a flame torch
the-dump 2019-08-08 21:35:53 then the flame will have a direction
the-dump 2019-08-08 21:36:13 possibly
the-dump 2019-08-08 21:36:52 why so
the-dump 2019-08-08 21:37:00 yep
the-dump 2019-08-08 21:37:10 but what does nitrogen do to stop it
the-dump 2019-08-08 21:37:16 just being there?
the-dump 2019-08-08 21:37:32 keeping it unpureoxgyen
the-dump 2019-08-08 21:37:35 rip grammar
the-dump 2019-08-08 21:37:45 so that it isnt pure oxygen
the-dump 2019-08-08 21:38:02 but that wont stop the station from exploding :d
the-dump 2019-08-08 21:38:06 anything can
the-dump 2019-08-08 21:38:17 except for the materials used to make fire
the-dump 2019-08-08 21:38:52 the idea of it is still the same with nitrogen as a gas
the-dump 2019-08-08 21:38:59 or any gas other than the flamable ones
the-dump 2019-08-08 21:39:19 doesnt need to be a gas to put out the fire which is obvious :d

creations-chat 2019-09-05 03:42:22 those graphics may just be turned up for the picutre itself
creations-chat 2019-09-05 03:42:29 as we have no clu on the fps
creations-chat 2019-09-05 03:42:37 xD
creations-chat 2019-09-05 03:46:03 honestly these block pictures prove almost nothing

creations-chat 2019-09-05 03:47:06 to get ranks bruhaps?
creations-chat 2019-09-05 03:47:20 but honestly they take too much time and effort to make
creations-chat 2019-09-05 03:47:21 lol
creations-chat 2019-09-05 03:49:13 it might be a sun set but that doesnt matter
creations-chat 2019-09-05 03:49:38 nice
help 2019-09-11 03:25:21 i do agree that it may either be too fat so more wings and or its too slow
help 2019-09-11 03:25:36 so more thrust
help 2019-09-11 03:26:02 unless if u speed is pretty fast then it would be because u have not enough  any control surfaces
help 2019-09-11 03:27:54 i honestly dont give a heck for ratios
help 2019-09-11 03:28:01 i just do enough everytime somehow
help 2019-09-11 03:28:06 :d
help 2019-09-11 03:28:24 just enough that it can fly to your liking i suppose
help 2019-09-11 03:28:30 eh
help 2019-09-11 03:28:36 maybe then it might be too much xDDDD
help 2019-09-11 03:28:40 aight
help 2019-09-11 03:28:56 xD
help 2019-09-11 03:29:11 also ping me and/or post here if u find the ratio :d

help 2019-09-11 03:30:17 how bout dat
creations-chat 2019-09-12 03:38:18 if only mouse aim had been in the game
help 2019-09-12 03:44:03 what is the close tracking option in the rocket
creations-chat 2019-09-12 03:44:10 xd
help 2019-09-12 03:44:33 is it for tracking players?
help 2019-09-12 03:57:56 is the range big?
help 2019-09-14 14:57:00 or you could have just told him to look at the pinned comments :/
help 2019-09-14 14:57:16 also why didnt you cange some of the words to make it easier for them to understand
help 2019-09-14 14:57:22 change
help 2019-09-14 14:57:39 cause now they think you are going to ban the accused xD
creations-chat 2019-09-14 23:17:31 i kinda agree
creations-chat 2019-09-14 23:17:48 a little sand wouldn't do any harm
creations-chat 2019-09-14 23:18:11 c:
creations-chat 2019-09-14 23:18:11 cause then it would look as if it came from a desert
creations-chat 2019-09-14 23:18:41 plus it looks like a humvee made for the desert
creations-chat 2019-09-14 23:18:59 so a lil bit of sand can tune it in more
creations-chat 2019-09-14 23:23:10 blocky at the bow?
creations-chat 2019-09-14 23:24:28 and it might be a better picture if it was taken *on the water*
creations-chat 2019-09-14 23:24:47 cause after all you made that ship for it to be used while on water right?
creations-chat 2019-09-14 23:38:17 other parts of the ship looks fine except for the bow
creations-chat 2019-09-14 23:38:19 :p
creations-chat 2019-09-14 23:38:37 and also those markings seem out of place unless if I'm wrong.
creations-chat 2019-09-14 23:39:11 is this a ship from real life?
creations-chat 2019-09-14 23:39:17 if so what is the name of it
creations-chat 2019-09-14 23:39:47 ooo nice

bug-reports 2019-09-15 19:34:08 ***YEESH***
creations-chat 2019-09-15 21:14:07 depends
creations-chat 2019-09-15 21:17:39 that is tombstone

creations-chat 2019-09-16 00:50:54 😄

creations-chat 2019-09-16 23:05:16 Nice
help 2019-09-17 05:18:31 oof
help 2019-09-17 05:18:50 it can always be done as a side project
help 2019-09-17 05:18:58 but who would even want to do all that work
help 2019-09-21 18:24:31 lol
help 2019-09-21 18:27:30 oof
help 2019-09-21 18:30:31 finally
help 2019-09-21 18:31:21 is your center of weight above the thrusters?
help 2019-09-21 18:31:24 that muight be why
help 2019-09-21 18:31:32 that it is tipping over
help 2019-09-21 18:31:52 since if your center of mass is under the thrusters then it would have self righted
help 2019-09-21 18:32:35 wait can u show us a video of u trying to start it up
help 2019-09-21 18:32:47 like the reaction of your creation as soon as it takes off
help 2019-09-21 18:33:05 aight
creations-chat 2019-09-21 18:34:20 isnt the bulb (forgot what it is called) suppose to be under the waves?
creations-chat 2019-09-21 18:34:26 although in real life that would also work
creations-chat 2019-09-21 18:34:39 but i see that u are trying to make a replica
help 2019-09-21 18:34:42 yep
help 2019-09-21 18:34:53 the better the quality of the test the easier it is so take your time
creations-chat 2019-09-21 18:35:46 yes helium to keep it upright
creations-chat 2019-09-21 18:36:14 well if u put too little then it would tip
creations-chat 2019-09-21 18:36:33 but u can walys put some ballasts on the bottom side of the ship to weight it down
creations-chat 2019-09-21 18:36:36 nice
creations-chat 2019-09-21 18:36:51 but the bulbous tip is still above the water line though
creations-chat 2019-09-21 18:36:57 but that isnt neccesarily bad
creations-chat 2019-09-21 18:37:01 aight
creations-chat 2019-09-21 18:37:06 some tips are to put ballasts
creations-chat 2019-09-21 18:37:16 just ballast and making the bottom heavy
creations-chat 2019-09-21 18:37:17 k
help 2019-09-21 18:37:33 ah
help 2019-09-21 18:37:49 yes
help 2019-09-21 18:37:56 just the angles of your thrusters
help 2019-09-21 18:38:16 which is the problem as u gotta find that middle line
help 2019-09-21 18:38:37 where they both can work together to not pitch the craft up or down
help 2019-09-21 18:39:03 yes weight is one of the problems
help 2019-09-21 18:39:15 maybe put more weights on the side tipping up?
help 2019-09-21 18:39:19 like the tail bit
help 2019-09-21 18:39:29 or just lower the thrusters
help 2019-09-21 18:39:35 or change them to the normal kind
help 2019-09-21 18:39:46 to reduce the ammount of force so they are balance
help 2019-09-21 18:39:49 yes
help 2019-09-21 18:40:25 wait a sec
help 2019-09-21 18:40:36 most of the weight is lifted by the front thrusters
help 2019-09-21 18:40:47 so u dont even need a lot of thrust from the back thrusters
help 2019-09-21 18:41:07 just enough to cancel the front thrusters from tipping the craft
help 2019-09-21 18:41:16 as the com is behind the center of the thrusters
help 2019-09-21 18:41:31 tell me
help 2019-09-21 18:42:39 there are two pairs the front and the back right?
help 2019-09-21 18:43:07 and there isnt any middle ones
help 2019-09-21 18:43:43 and it does a front flip everytime u run it
help 2019-09-21 18:44:32 do u think there is a balance as in the front and back cancel each other's rotations
help 2019-09-21 18:44:44 thecraft's*
help 2019-09-21 18:45:38 maybe just experiment more with the numbers of the thrusters and types of propulsion to find the balance
help 2019-09-21 18:46:57 u can try adding wings to the back to reduce the thrust in order to balance it out
help 2019-09-21 18:47:14 i see
help 2019-09-21 18:47:20 xD
help 2019-09-21 18:47:36 active counters dont work so try passive but u already did
help 2019-09-21 18:47:42 does it make any differences/
help 2019-09-21 18:48:09 i think i need to join u to be able to make sense of this XD

help 2019-09-21 18:51:03 hopefully
help 2019-09-21 18:52:08 btw can we get a pic of the entire thing while still in build mode?
help 2019-09-21 18:52:40 knew it
help 2019-09-21 18:53:00 ho are u gonna fly forward u got a different set of keys?
help 2019-09-21 18:53:49 so the roations of the thrusters are controlled under one set of keys
help 2019-09-21 18:53:57 so something like w & s
help 2019-09-21 18:54:11 and the thrusters are controlled differently
help 2019-09-21 18:54:14 same differences
help 2019-09-21 18:54:21 so two paris of keys
help 2019-09-21 18:54:35 something like a&q for the front pair and e&d for the back pair
help 2019-09-21 18:54:57 no just for the thrusters
help 2019-09-21 18:55:01 not th emotors

help 2019-09-21 18:57:36 eh

help 2019-09-21 19:15:47 k i actually gotta go B-2 Spirit Bomber mode
help 2019-09-21 19:15:52 c ya
help 2019-09-21 19:16:18 ah that xplane thing
help 2019-09-21 19:16:21 bye
help 2019-09-21 19:16:22 xD
help 2019-09-21 19:18:37 omg i just thought of something that would help u fix your balancing problems
help 2019-09-21 19:18:50 remember when u flew upside down into the void?
help 2019-09-21 19:18:57 wait
help 2019-09-21 19:19:00 eh
help 2019-09-21 19:19:02 well
help 2019-09-21 19:19:05 i just tell anyways
help 2019-09-21 19:19:25 while your plane was flying upside down into the void it wasnt very even
help 2019-09-21 19:19:40 that is because it was never even/balanced
help 2019-09-21 19:20:02 your tail was under your nose which suggests that u had more thrust in the back than the front
help 2019-09-21 19:20:12 and while it is flying down
help 2019-09-21 19:20:18 it didnt try to do flips
help 2019-09-21 19:20:40 which means that the problem was your thrusters being too powerful in the back
help 2019-09-21 19:21:09 so u might have to reduce thrust in the back or add more wings to act as air brakes (if u get what i mean  by airbrakes)
help 2019-09-21 19:22:01 yes but this method can be very useful for vtols so that u can identify if it is the thrusters or something else
help 2019-09-21 19:22:05 ok i typed too much
help 2019-09-21 19:22:07 bye
help 2019-09-21 19:34:08 <@456226577798135808> help <@!410465103058698264>

creations-chat 2019-09-21 23:42:31 what discorvery im confuse
help 2019-09-21 23:42:48 yes very chonky which is why the nose is hard
help 2019-09-21 23:42:50 :/
help 2019-09-21 23:43:13 we need better wedges and more of them
help 2019-09-21 23:43:50 eh not sure how that would help the game
help 2019-09-21 23:43:51 :p
help 2019-09-21 23:44:04 yeh
help 2019-09-21 23:51:20 im not sure if that is what we want
help 2019-09-21 23:51:26 as a whole
help 2019-09-22 18:27:43 I see <@!210150527692963840>
help 2019-09-22 21:08:36 even if the rotation forces do cancel out, the helicopter will still strafe sideways because of the tail rotor
help 2019-09-22 21:11:44 <@251079218333614080> just create a system that can drag the motor inside with it
help 2019-09-22 21:12:21 so that once the thing is folded into place, then that system just drags the motor and whatever is stuck to it into the other piece
help 2019-09-22 21:12:48 although i havent done anything like such, Im sure it is possible
help 2019-09-22 21:12:56 cause in my mind it is very possible
help 2019-09-22 21:13:17 although it will be soon when i actually need to use folding on my *BIG* plane
creations-chat 2019-09-22 21:25:43 I have a bad feelin about how the motor is sticking out on the small *turrets*
creations-chat 2019-09-22 21:39:50 them turrets will be useless without their base u know

help 2019-09-23 22:28:29 I had wanted that rank prior to being  removed
help 2019-09-23 22:28:40 Like since I started playing :/
help 2019-09-23 22:28:52 But I have a few ideas so Imma test it
help 2019-09-23 22:29:56 I mean like
help 2019-09-23 22:30:09 That is basically the same as using motors
help 2019-09-23 22:30:20 And motor is better anyways for function
help 2019-09-23 22:30:42 Well
help 2019-09-23 22:30:48 It takes up more sspace
help 2019-09-23 22:31:04 And I can use that space to add a lot more motors to make it more advance
help 2019-09-23 22:31:23 Motors take up less space and function the same
help 2019-09-23 22:31:29 :/
help 2019-09-23 22:31:37 Not rlly
help 2019-09-23 22:31:45 Esactly
help 2019-09-23 22:31:53 Which is why people hide the motors :/

help 2019-09-23 22:33:39 Wait just gimme me a few seconds
help 2019-09-23 22:33:59 What u invented here is very good for say battleships
help 2019-09-23 22:34:10 But not really for tanks unless if it is big
help 2019-09-23 22:34:19 Since the turret can be used to turn fast or turn slow
help 2019-09-23 22:34:34 Wait a minute the motors can also do the same thing :/
help 2019-09-23 22:35:37 Eh idk about that
help 2019-09-23 22:35:46 But if u can make it work then it doesn't really matter
help 2019-09-23 22:35:50 :D
help 2019-09-23 22:36:28 Well u can always use motors if space is a factor
help 2019-09-23 22:36:49 Anyways my break is up

bug-reports 2019-10-03 00:56:42 hehe it was just a joke cause we all know that it is almost impossible to place blocks in blcoks in the build mode
bug-reports 2019-10-03 00:57:10 try hovering your cursor on the block on the side
bug-reports 2019-10-03 00:57:24 see if that wall of block will let u place your wedge how u want it

bug-reports 2019-10-03 01:01:36 it has been here for a long time ithink
bug-reports 2019-10-03 01:01:47 just try saving your build to a different slot
bug-reports 2019-10-03 01:01:52 then clear the old slot
bug-reports 2019-10-03 01:02:05 idk if that is gonna work actually
bug-reports 2019-10-03 01:59:10 possibly
bug-reports 2019-10-03 01:59:26 u can probably replicate the bug by spamming the place block button

help 2019-10-15 05:15:26 possibly something to do with the surroundings of the seat
creations-chat 2019-10-15 05:27:00 i think that has already been made before
creations-chat 2019-10-15 05:27:40 the other one took advantage of the motor lock "glitch"

creations-chat 2019-10-16 04:24:22 ^ c:
help 2019-10-16 04:37:18 possibly because of your suspension is either too tight or not tight enough
help 2019-10-16 04:37:40 or the flaps are just pulled into another block causing it to glitch into it
help 2019-10-16 05:01:30 that im not sure of since it is something that is differenfent for different builds
help 2019-10-16 05:02:05 meaning that the stiffness is something that ust be experimented on since there isnt a reliablet table of weight to block ratio
help 2019-10-16 05:02:40 just a question
help 2019-10-16 05:02:51 are u using motor 2 for the angling of the flaps?
help 2019-10-16 22:31:48 <@355129846940303381> i think it's better if motor 2 is used
help 2019-10-16 22:32:13 Because then u can put it to servo and put a maxangle
help 2019-10-16 22:34:07 Ideal features of flaps would generally be: have a max angle (so holding it would not result in too much angle) and flaps reset back to original position after keybind is not used.
creations-chat 2019-10-17 01:39:44 duh its folded but size doesnt really matter too much if there is 1x7 and 1x1 blocks
creations-chat 2019-10-17 02:28:49 u mean prick our computers

creations-chat 2019-10-18 06:24:04 What I would call advance fold is a fold that is flushed
creations-chat 2019-10-18 06:24:21 Meaning u can’t see the motor from the outside

bug-reports 2020-04-27 22:54:17 Has anyone seen this whatever thing before?
bug-reports 2020-04-27 22:54:19 Everytime I unanchor, it makes me spazz out.
bug-reports 2020-04-27 22:57:53 I really hate it, it was somewhat fine a few moments ago, and then I did something and this happened.
bug-reports 2020-04-27 23:03:03 It might be due to too many blocks like pistons? or maybe it is because of the tnt balls I have in the magazine.
bug-reports 2020-04-27 23:04:42 I use both, but I don't think it is due to the springs, suspension Idk yet.
bug-reports 2020-04-27 23:05:36 Nah, suspensions don't seem to affect it.
bug-reports 2020-04-28 01:07:49 xd
bug-reports 2020-04-28 01:09:12 It seems when there is too much pistons attached to one motor, it really becomes buggy.
bug-reports 2020-04-28 01:09:55 As in, the piston base and head jumps up and down depending on the orientations.
creations-chat 2020-04-29 16:57:17 xD
bug-reports 2020-04-29 18:10:09 https://gyazo.com/61adc00ad9f77cc06416053b4d075822 https://gyazo.com/e39a93dd20d3617544982229daf95882
bug-reports 2020-04-29 18:10:48 It seems whenever I put on too many pistons on a  motor, it starts to spaz out and go crazy.
bug-reports 2020-04-29 18:11:29 And then the piston heads just jumps up and down rapidly which also affects the other lose items around it (such as the tnt balls which got flung).
bug-reports 2020-04-29 18:12:40 It also seems that whenever there is less tnt balls on the piston it functions better.
bug-reports 2020-04-29 18:41:14 Hm after some experiments I removed the magnets, and it seems to function better
bug-reports 2020-04-29 18:42:15 The pistons don't dance like crazy anymore every time I use it, but it still dances up and down but it isn't as gun breaking.
bug-reports 2020-04-29 18:42:50 Although I have to sacrifice some range to achieve reliability 😦
bug-reports 2020-04-29 18:49:51 After rejoining the game it seems to be better, either that, or the update helped a little.
bug-reports 2020-04-29 21:04:32 lol I hate the piston physics thing with passion xd.
help 2020-04-29 21:37:05 What does the physics option in the anchored block do?
help 2020-04-29 21:37:11 allow for moving things to move?
help 2020-04-30 01:39:08 yeah just find out what the rank requires, then compare, if it doesn't match then they probably won't give you the rank.
bug-reports 2020-04-30 03:20:59 So...whenever I unanchored my tank, its turret always moves to the right 45 degrees no matter where my mouse is. After that, the turret moves fine: https://gyazo.com/24470bb32f0c890411ce5162c15f8f2a
bug-reports 2020-04-30 03:21:26 Another example: https://gyazo.com/0a57c4e790418e50a75fb528e28325d2
bug-reports 2020-04-30 03:22:58 Probably a minor bug, but it does some times fling my tnt balls around which is annoying because I have to spawn it in again to be able to keep my magazine at full capacity. :/
bug-reports 2020-04-30 03:23:11 I don't know why it does so either.
bug-reports 2020-04-30 03:32:06 Soo...after I press the button that activates my magnets (my magnets don't have toggle on) it makes my tank continue moving despite not pressing nor holding the button that activates the magnets (yes the magnets are affecting the treads, that I know, but I don't know why the effects of the magnet stays even after turning off). It is also preventing me from using the magnets to extend my gun range :/ .Me pressing the magnet button and its effects: https://gyazo.com/1ad183c61532e3226a6f3e088e37d859 After pressing the magnet button and letting the tank do whatever it s doing: https://gyazo.com/0a70020588b197a3ef7b2cc2b7efcdf9
bug-reports 2020-04-30 03:32:55 Pressing the magnets again and again doesn't get rid of the after effects.
bug-reports 2020-04-30 03:34:52 I want to make it 1 : 1 scale :/
bug-reports 2020-04-30 03:35:32 rope treads are more simple than motor treads and easier to use and applying it to the tank.
bug-reports 2020-04-30 04:13:51 Hm that has never ever happened to me before (thank goodness), very interesting indeed.
bug-reports 2020-04-30 04:14:12 xD

help 2020-05-06 16:30:50 lol
help 2020-05-06 16:31:23 I see
help 2020-05-06 16:31:26 I do agree
help 2020-05-06 17:28:34 Which one seems to be more laggy (rope treads or motor treads)?
creations-chat 2020-05-06 23:21:56 What kind of thank you guys like?
help 2020-05-07 02:38:29 Hey what's yall's favorite tanks?
help 2020-05-07 02:58:14 I need help with my tank options because I have little amount of tanks that I know of.
help 2020-05-07 03:02:55 hm interesting
help 2020-05-07 03:24:06 ripperonies
help 2020-05-07 03:54:09 yeah and also helium blocks to counterbalance the ballast
help 2020-05-07 03:58:15 lol
help 2020-05-07 03:58:22 However much you need
help 2020-05-07 03:58:35 just experiement and see what works best in terms of speed and reliability
help 2020-05-07 03:58:40 and hieight
help 2020-05-07 04:20:11 XD
help 2020-05-07 04:20:18 that is why I suggested using helium at the top
help 2020-05-07 04:20:25 also, that thing is overweight
help 2020-05-07 04:20:26 :d
help 2020-05-07 04:24:23 aight
help 2020-05-07 04:24:30 or just use pontoons
help 2020-05-07 04:24:43 on the sides of the ship mostly though
help 2020-05-07 04:24:44 and
help 2020-05-07 04:24:47 about water level
help 2020-05-07 04:25:09 so that it helps with stability without risking capsizing
help 2020-05-07 04:35:02 if you put it in the middle, then it will make the ship more unstable
help 2020-05-07 04:35:04 because
help 2020-05-07 04:35:08 kinda like a seesaw
help 2020-05-07 04:38:52 there is only one point of rotation (which in the case would be the pontoons) which makes the seesaw easy to tip left and right.
help 2020-05-07 04:54:29 oh nice that is what I thought
help 2020-05-08 03:45:27 What do you think about the beginnings of my Maus turret?
help 2020-05-08 03:45:46 Here is a semi side view:
help 2020-05-08 03:58:28 yeah I know about the length part
help 2020-05-08 03:58:39 I already have the ratio recorded
help 2020-05-08 03:58:55 what I was working on was the frontal part of the turret and where it meets the barrel.
help 2020-05-08 04:04:41 <@!467565971918422017> what do you think about the front part of the turret?
help 2020-05-08 04:10:43 thx cause I'm trying to make a 1:1 scale functional Maus.
help 2020-05-08 04:12:14 hehehe I know what I'm doing.
help 2020-05-08 04:12:31 Although I do need a little more patience and need to keep my sanity, but that is all.

help 2020-05-09 19:18:44 Anyone have any tips for reducing friction between blocks?
help 2020-05-09 19:19:13 using ice and wedge blocks to reduce friciton and surface contact?
help 2020-05-09 19:19:25 Using gaps inbetween blocks
help 2020-05-09 19:19:33 anything else other than those?
bug-reports 2020-05-09 21:38:32 Are conveyors bugged?
bug-reports 2020-05-09 21:40:51 I'm trying to use conveyors to carry tnt ball into my cannon yet everytime I setup everything (especially letting the conveyors touch the cannon piece) it just starts to kill my fps.
bug-reports 2020-05-09 22:59:08 oof ok
bug-reports 2020-05-09 22:59:32 I will just use pistons then :/
help 2020-05-10 01:00:41 I need some opinions on the dimensions of my Maus Turret: https://gyazo.com/c019a6f864cfc26835d4554822e1fd89
help 2020-05-10 01:07:47 Is my Maus Turret too short?
help 2020-05-10 01:51:42 Your blades are still oriented the wrong way for the tail rotor
help 2020-05-10 01:52:17 The rotor is achieving a 0 net force.
help 2020-05-10 01:52:37 2 blades are cancelling the other 2 blades.
help 2020-05-10 01:58:58 In this picture: https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/478584971670454284/708852982686547979/unknown.png
help 2020-05-10 01:59:10 the top and back blades are cancelling themselves out
help 2020-05-10 01:59:34 the front and bottom blades are cancelling each other out
help 2020-05-10 02:00:07 all you need to fix is either reorient the top and bottom or the front and back blades.
help 2020-05-10 02:00:53 That way they are all oriented in the same position whenever you rotate the rotor 90 degrees.
help 2020-05-10 02:47:33 I may need to join you later xD
help 2020-05-10 02:48:01 fr?

help 2020-05-10 05:31:15 "Build a plane" "Plane Crazy"
help 2020-05-10 16:25:00 <@!531903658011394058> what kind of treads (rope/motor/any other) are you making?
help 2020-05-10 16:25:59 ah I see
help 2020-05-10 16:26:17 Have you use some kind of mechanism to tighten the tracks?
help 2020-05-10 16:26:39 How about some kind of "guard" to keep the tracks from falling off to the side?
help 2020-05-10 16:26:48 I see
help 2020-05-10 16:27:04 yeah tightening your tracks is the main reason why your tracks are loose
help 2020-05-10 16:27:08 not*
help 2020-05-10 16:27:32 by making the treads less slack
help 2020-05-10 16:27:35 basically
help 2020-05-10 16:28:00 extending your wheels forwards or backwards to the point where it can't extend anymore
help 2020-05-10 16:29:30 ah holdup lemme get yah a good youtube video that explains it
help 2020-05-10 16:29:45 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCApi3yy6bA
help 2020-05-10 16:29:50 if you look at 5:30
help 2020-05-10 16:30:23 see how the person in the video used suspension to extend the front wheel forward?
help 2020-05-10 16:30:47 and the back wheel backwards?
help 2020-05-10 16:31:04 that is how you can reduce the slack in your tracks
help 2020-05-10 16:31:36 you can also use other things such as pistons to extend it
help 2020-05-10 16:32:03 spring should also work as well
help 2020-05-10 16:32:20 probably piston or suspension
help 2020-05-10 16:33:16 yeah cause then you wouldn't be able to see the "spring" ppart of the suspension or spring
help 2020-05-10 16:34:45 np
help 2020-05-10 19:03:33 You can fix the motor holes in the wings by moving the motor down by one using half blocks to attach to the wing
creations-chat 2020-05-10 19:42:42 yeesh
creations-chat 2020-05-10 19:43:13 XD
help 2020-05-10 23:30:48 no not that
help 2020-05-10 23:30:53 but close
help 2020-05-10 23:31:37 From experience of trying to make a tnt cannon using springs, ignore self allows you to still do damage from explosion, but your tnt won't explode on your own creation.
help 2020-05-10 23:32:07 t will just explode when hitting an enemy creation and not yours.
help 2020-05-11 04:23:55 Yes I agree
bot-central 2020-05-11 04:24:49 !help
help 2020-05-11 06:09:53 or
help 2020-05-11 06:10:06 just bring the com below the thruster things
help 2020-05-11 06:10:29 it is a simple natural way to keep the build stable especially while hovering
help 2020-05-11 06:10:46 basically you make it bottom heavy past the thrusters
help 2020-05-11 06:15:44 Then it will act like a pendulum which generally always goes back to the lowest energy position (the bottom rather than staying at the sides)
creations-chat 2020-05-11 06:35:33 lmao
help 2020-05-11 15:23:53 Coaxial Helicopters do not count for Helicopter Technician right?
help 2020-05-11 15:24:10 But can I still build a chinook for that rank?
help 2020-05-11 22:51:48 Here is my WIP 1:1 scale Maus turret, what are your opinions on it?
Top view:
help 2020-05-11 22:52:06 Back-Side View:
help 2020-05-11 22:52:26 Front-Side view:
help 2020-05-11 22:52:58 Is it too long? Narrow?
help 2020-05-11 22:53:23 I just need to know if the shape of the turret is good or needs modifications.
help 2020-05-11 22:54:54 yeah I know, I can't do much about it.
help 2020-05-11 22:55:01 I can't even make the cheeks correct
help 2020-05-11 22:55:36 wut that
help 2020-05-11 22:55:37 well
help 2020-05-11 22:55:45 I want it to have a functional tnt cannon
help 2020-05-11 22:56:04 it works now I just need to know if I can keep my ammo the way it is or take out some and make (turret) shorter (in length).
help 2020-05-11 22:57:14 that is cute
help 2020-05-11 22:57:22 ??
help 2020-05-11 22:57:48 May I see what you meant in person ingame?
help 2020-05-11 22:58:43 Ah I see, when you can do you mind showeing me it?
help 2020-05-11 23:00:04 but what about the length and width of the turret?
help 2020-05-11 23:00:12 those are my main probing questions
help 2020-05-11 23:01:03 yep I feel that way too.
help 2020-05-11 23:01:31 but I don't wanna make it too wide because I wanna make it as close to scale using the seat size
help 2020-05-11 23:02:03 sure
help 2020-05-11 23:02:40 yeah
help 2020-05-11 23:12:36 looks like I now know my solution, to widen it a block left and right
help 2020-05-12 00:00:51 How about now <@!296280922771292170> ?
help 2020-05-12 00:01:00 Here is more:
help 2020-05-12 00:01:10 Back-Side:
help 2020-05-12 00:01:48 I increased the side by one and the length back by one.
help 2020-05-12 00:01:55 2* for the length
help 2020-05-12 00:01:59 oh ok
help 2020-05-12 00:02:05 how about the height?
help 2020-05-12 00:02:11 what do you think?
help 2020-05-12 00:04:20 hehehehe more ammo for the Mouse King.

help 2020-05-13 03:52:50 walking in many building games are a pain to make.
help 2020-05-13 03:53:02 my best advice is to keep experimenting.
help 2020-05-13 05:34:33 You can always try to make a simple walker first to understand how walking in roblox works, then you can apply what you find out when making a bigger mech that has to fully exploit roblox physics to work well.
creations-chat 2020-05-13 05:47:37 I challenge yall to make a b-52
creations-chat 2020-05-13 06:06:14 nice maus, Im also making a maus
creations-chat 2020-05-13 06:06:52 Once I finish, I wanna duel your maus, with my maus.
creations-chat 2020-05-13 06:10:09 Are you planning to add treads to it?
creations-chat 2020-05-13 06:24:23 it is probably red to make it easier to see when building
creations-chat 2020-05-13 06:24:48 I colored my Maus grey because white is too hard to see.
creations-chat 2020-05-13 06:25:12 Does the gun of youir maus move?
creations-chat 2020-05-13 06:30:57 you can post in <#384025409945337856> itself
help 2020-05-13 22:58:12 well
help 2020-05-13 22:58:19 are you using counter rotating blades?
help 2020-05-13 22:58:24 rotors whatever
help 2020-05-13 22:58:32 like
help 2020-05-13 23:07:40 the bottom rotates one way and the top rotates the other way right?
help 2020-05-13 23:07:57 so that your helicopter doesn't spin out of control?
help 2020-05-13 23:08:06 if that is the case then do:
help 2020-05-13 23:08:12 / at the top
help 2020-05-13 23:08:17 \ at the bottom
help 2020-05-13 23:08:21 vice versa
help 2020-05-14 20:14:26 Is inventor rank achievable anymore?
help 2020-05-14 20:15:07 ...
help 2020-05-14 20:15:10 well that shucks
help 2020-05-14 20:15:19 literally the only thing I'm good at.
help 2020-05-14 20:15:26 :p
help 2020-05-15 01:49:17 yeah sure, I will keep doing what I like.

help 2020-11-18 05:37:56 who's making accurate and not chonky B-52 landing gears? xD
help 2020-11-18 05:39:01 sure, mine is still very chonky and not compact enough for 1-1 scaled B-52.
help 2020-11-18 05:39:20 sure
help 2020-11-18 05:40:35 Here is a bit old gif of it working: https://gyazo.com/22f980f715d20859531888d5b49e15ad
help 2020-11-18 05:41:10 general design is still fundmentally the same, and if you want to see the components themselves, it will probably be easier to join me
help 2020-11-18 05:41:37 xD
help 2020-11-18 05:41:54 would you like to join me verthox?
help 2020-11-18 05:43:50 my thingy is a tad bit complicated to set the angles correctly, other than that, it is simply 1 button to extend and another to retract
help 2020-11-18 05:44:21 so I need clever solutions to reduce the size of the angle setting mechanism even further.
help 2020-11-18 05:52:25 sure thing, but I probably won't be able to go on later, so perhaps tmr?
help 2020-11-18 05:53:18 I will be on from about 3 hours from now, to the time right now.
help 2020-11-18 05:56:19 I can't play right now, and I probably won't be able to play tmr at this hour.
help 2020-11-19 05:26:14 <@!206891768233328640> One way of doing it is just let the ball/other explosive filled bomb spin, then once it is spinning, let the smaller bombs drop out to spread before impact.
help 2020-11-19 05:28:36 hm I see, then I'm not much of help with that then
help 2020-11-19 22:22:17 <@!462077072399925250> sails perhaps?
help 2021-08-10 06:18:18 You can try using motor lock to pull it out then disconnect it from the build perhaps?
creations-chat 2021-08-11 05:48:08 The glass bit at the back top seems a little too long (comparing the top and bottom, the bottom image has the glass piece going above the backseat but it doesn't go past it (curve) much) and the glass piece (compare the bottom of it to the bottom of the other image) itself isn't angled perhaps?

creations-chat 2022-10-18 02:43:00 This Mecanum wheel design could definitely be improved on (compactness, reliability)  as it was a quick build from me since I just wanted to get it working first.

If you guys want to improve on it then it would be great. : D, you can see the build screen in my YouTube demo link for reference
https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/384025409945337856/1031750420793671830
creations-chat 2022-10-18 02:45:33 😄
creations-chat 2022-10-18 03:02:06 I believe so because I only took 30 minutes to make it : P and I'm being serious too, I actually do have an idea of what I want to try next to compact further. As for reliability, if you watch the YouTube demo there is a section where problems occur and my entire build exploded when I was trying to fix the rotation of the small wheels (though it was mostly because I was also recording since normally that wouldn't happen). xD
creations-chat 2022-10-18 03:04:25 could you help explain to me what you mean? google ain't helping
creations-chat 2022-10-29 18:23:59 Yeah I tried that before, and yep it would be more complicated but more stable. However, getting them aligned correctly will be a pain since the locked motors like to drift so I will need a way to physically restrict its motion before locking it. : P
