creations-chat 2022-03-19 21:57:21 i was in the middle of building the intake and my desktop gave off a "Mr. Stark I don't feel so good." smell <:empty:794431705070174238>
creations-chat 2022-03-20 01:18:57 kinda thinking the f-22 types
creations-chat 2022-03-20 01:23:29 I fixed the wings, intakes, and minimized as much motor lock I could, as asked. anything else I need to preform?
creations-chat 2022-03-20 01:27:05 Is it the back or the front of the intakes that need fixing and does the wings need fixing in the back or the front as well, just wondering.
creations-chat 2022-03-20 16:23:29 ok also sorry for not responding so quickly i had to get this stupid rash on my body checked
creations-chat 2022-03-20 19:10:28 Put the exposed motorlock to rest, anything else needing fixing?
creations-chat 2022-03-20 19:14:27 Just wondering is there anything else I need to do. ik "putting the exposed motorlock to rest" sounds like a hate crime but what is there left to do?
creations-chat 2022-03-20 19:18:15 mig-35 edit: wait there's more than 1?

creations-chat 2022-05-27 22:46:57 what trouble has an f-14 in war thunder do to you
bug-reports 2022-06-02 04:06:00 just to say if your having problems with motor teleportation (regular locked motors, not motor2) were every time you move a motor it teleports back to place and never locks it could be 1: the motor is set to reset 2: an software in the background running on your pc could be causing it (for me with my f-14 it was razer synapse) 3: pc2 isnt out yet. i dont mean for it to fix basewars problem as of now but its something thats bugged my builds that id like to share ideas of how to fix.
creations-chat 2022-06-15 08:24:15 is this gonna be too small (its a mig-21 aerofred one seater)
creations-chat 2022-06-15 08:28:17 ok thx

creations-chat 2022-07-01 05:55:04 its ok if it sucks, that means theres plenty of room for improvement
creations-chat 2022-07-01 05:57:32 looks good i suggest using a picture to refrence from. a blueprint or 3d model maybe will work.
the-dump 2022-07-01 06:03:40 
creations-chat 2022-07-01 06:21:05 things can get better and maybe we will get better players but i think we might have to wait another 2-4 years ( ik my builds suck but i dont plan on improving, i cant get any better)
creations-chat 2022-07-01 06:27:19 all i can say is that as long as we can get and see improvement we can get the server back on track rn most of the server is whitenames but ill get better but remeber plane crazy isnt just a game its like learning to ride a bike or draw hype things, it takes time

creations-chat 2022-12-22 00:54:41 is this good for a mirage wing or should i just use regular wing panels?
creations-chat 2022-12-22 01:02:45 roblox's website doesn't have a Web.Roblox.com on it or is it just the private servers ðŸ¤” (mxrkava i didnt know that thanks for pointing that out)
creations-chat 2022-12-22 01:27:53 how does it looks so far? (Mirage 2000-5)
creations-chat 2022-12-22 01:34:30 only reason im using it is because you can see decals through it (might remove it though)
creations-chat 2022-12-22 01:38:35 ill probably use regular glass when uploading images of it since ik it triggers you guys <:FineTroll:626841259746656289>

creations-chat 2023-04-09 04:17:09 the same stupid high ping thing happened to my hind, got over pinged and died <:nooo:787097964946259978>
creations-chat 2023-04-09 04:20:17 could sending the springs to heaven fix it, or im just screwed cause i dont use private servers most of the time (edit: i had the idea to magnet push them to the dead zone under the map)
creations-chat 2023-04-09 04:23:50 its as shrimple as having no life<:clueless:942802644043464734>
creations-chat 2023-04-09 04:27:35 simple, just push the mass amount of springs off with a few magnets, send them to the dead zone to despawn under the map (reason not to send them into the sky is because it only makes it worse)
creations-chat 2023-04-09 04:33:55 although that was a random ping it doesnt bother me that much, understandable that it was a mistake
