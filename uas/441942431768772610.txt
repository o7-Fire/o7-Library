bug-reports 2021-01-06 18:17:12 if a server is laggy (wich it often is) impact bombs explore delayed and dont cause any damage 90% of the time. i know this is well known but it makes my missiles useless and i just want some way to have it fixed

so 99% of the time i cant use my custom missiles
bug-reports 2021-01-06 18:41:40 my missile is auto targeting so it really only works with on impact
bug-reports 2021-01-06 18:41:59 move this to dms or general if you wanna discuss this

creations-chat 2021-02-25 10:06:33 id say i did good for my second sub! i finished the build itself a few hours ago and ive been polishing it out a bit
creations-chat 2021-02-25 10:09:08 my sub carries a total of 8 torpedos that can all be remote controlled and steered towards the target! final block count 2540
creations-chat 2021-02-25 10:13:00 its my second sub. before this i havent done naval builds so this is uncharted territory for me! been playing since alpha tho but did have a long break from the game till beta
help 2021-02-26 11:27:23 how do i weaponize and make a ship more stable
help 2021-02-26 11:30:29 also would this be wide enough for a destroyers bottom? the 3D model has a wider one but this seems alright
help 2021-02-26 11:31:18 oh god
help 2021-02-26 11:31:25 so just make the bottom S Q U A R E
help 2021-02-26 11:31:41 alright thanks

help 2021-02-26 11:32:44 normal blocks right?
help 2021-02-26 11:32:50 idk if i should use halfs
help 2021-02-26 11:33:00 i normaly use halfs
help 2021-02-26 11:33:10 i used halfs for me submarine
help 2021-02-26 11:35:09 it would be my first "ship" (excluding submarine) so im being careful
help 2021-02-26 11:35:17 is this wide enough?
help 2021-02-26 11:37:03 this seems alright
help 2021-02-26 11:39:14 planning on doing that
help 2021-02-26 11:40:09 this is what i did
help 2021-02-26 11:40:30 i dont think it looks good like that
help 2021-02-26 11:40:57 il carry on and if it still looks bad with the other stuff then il remake the sides
help 2021-02-26 11:41:10 im going for a stealthy destroyer
help 2021-02-26 11:41:21 so i want the sides to be at a angle
help 2021-02-26 11:42:04 i am planning on doing that
help 2021-02-26 11:45:03 can you add a few regular wedges in the spaces on the side?
help 2021-02-26 11:47:29 after looking at the 3d model of the destroyer im tryna make i have realized that i cant make a stealth destroyer ***too complicated for me***
help 2021-02-26 11:47:47 so can someone give me a new idea for the shape of the side?
help 2021-02-26 11:50:47 new strat: im just gonna make the nose of the ship and build from that!
help 2021-02-26 11:51:56 question: h o w do i make the nose of the ship. i know wedges but h o w
help 2021-02-26 11:51:59 i
help 2021-02-26 11:52:10 i dont want it to just go straight up
help 2021-02-26 11:52:34 i wanna have it actually look good
help 2021-02-26 11:56:07 im trying
help 2021-02-26 11:56:13 but i dont know how to achive a curved shape
help 2021-02-26 11:58:02 alright
help 2021-02-26 12:02:46 15 blocks wide so now i start making the curve
help 2021-02-26 12:07:48 oh?
help 2021-02-26 12:10:34 so
help 2021-02-26 12:10:38 build the curve first
help 2021-02-26 12:10:43 then the wedges?
help 2021-02-26 12:26:23 i used alot of wedgeblocks in the shape but how am i supposed to pull this off now???
help 2021-02-26 12:26:27 its 2 blocks high
help 2021-02-26 12:26:38 and theres no 2x2 wedgeblocks
help 2021-02-26 12:27:25 oh wait im probably supid
help 2021-02-26 12:30:02 nvm that wont work
help 2021-02-26 12:34:44 F
help 2021-02-26 12:44:09 how far should i go up with the front?
help 2021-02-26 12:48:20 its already getting too wide
help 2021-02-26 12:51:18 one more block up and it will be 21 blocks wide
help 2021-02-26 12:51:33 im starting to think that this is gonna be a battleship instead of a destroyer
help 2021-02-26 13:16:36 how long should it go up for
help 2021-02-26 13:17:28 rn it goes 5 blocks up
help 2021-02-26 13:26:37 like 2 folds
help 2021-02-26 13:26:38 maybe
help 2021-02-27 00:11:18 will i have to remake the nose of my ship again? its getting really wide and i wanna have it not be 20 blocks wide
help 2021-02-27 00:11:32 ideal would be like 13 or 16 bocks wide
help 2021-02-27 00:12:11 and the nose is only 5 blocks high and i wanna have it go up a little more
help 2021-02-27 00:12:58 oh yeah
help 2021-02-27 00:12:59 sorry
help 2021-02-27 00:13:13 let me take a picture of the current bow
help 2021-02-27 00:13:40 
help 2021-02-27 00:13:56 i might have to remove some of the wedgeblocks at the front
help 2021-02-27 00:14:22 i want it to look good on the build when its finished
help 2021-02-27 00:16:29 more like a lemon
help 2021-02-27 00:16:48 yeah il remake it to make the very tip be not as flat
help 2021-02-27 00:17:55 how many blocks should it go up for
help 2021-02-27 00:18:04 so it dosent look like its half submerged
help 2021-02-27 00:18:35 i meant how high up should the ship go
help 2021-02-27 00:18:51 yours goes 9 blocks up
help 2021-02-27 00:19:03 doing that right now
help 2021-02-27 00:20:06 alright
help 2021-02-27 00:20:22 il work on the bow for a little bit and then let you judge how it looks
help 2021-02-27 00:20:40 my plan is to use wedge block then 1x2 wedge block and move up instead of having it all mixed up
help 2021-02-27 00:22:00 alright
help 2021-02-27 00:25:23 would this work better?
help 2021-02-27 00:29:52 or should i cut out the 1x1 wedgeblock
help 2021-02-27 00:32:47 im going for a destroyer or a cruiser if a destroyer is too hard for me to make
help 2021-02-27 00:33:01 so something thats not too wide
help 2021-02-27 00:36:31 modern

help 2021-02-27 00:37:30 america
help 2021-02-27 00:37:46 if i cant make a american one il make a German one
help 2021-02-27 00:38:40 well
help 2021-02-27 00:38:40 oh
help 2021-02-27 00:38:47 i have another one in mind
help 2021-02-27 00:39:42 this is also a ship i would love to make soon but i might just ditch the destroyer and make this now https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nordrhein-Westfalen_(F_223)
help 2021-02-27 00:40:06 i live in Nordrhein-Westfalen
help 2021-02-27 00:40:26 its a Frigate
help 2021-02-27 00:42:30 it has a 127mm gun and some harpoon missiles. and a anti air system
help 2021-02-27 00:42:51 il build it
help 2021-02-27 00:43:05 it seems like a easy enough ship to start out with
help 2021-02-27 00:43:24 why?
help 2021-02-27 00:44:22 il look for a top view
help 2021-02-27 00:46:02 theres also this from the side. maybe that will help with the bow
help 2021-02-27 00:46:34 do you have any advice on how i should start with this
help 2021-02-27 00:48:37 il probably sit here for atleast 2 hours trying to figure out the bow
help 2021-02-27 00:49:53 the ship isnt that big so maybe i wont need a fold
help 2021-02-27 00:59:26 every time i try to build the bow it just gets really w i d e at the front along the way
help 2021-02-27 01:03:33 i made it pointy at the start and it has devolved back to this
help 2021-02-27 01:09:00 i kinda managed to pull off the shape of it
help 2021-02-27 01:09:08 not the best but looks close enough
help 2021-02-27 01:09:47 the bulge wont be visible. people told me whats under water isnt important since it would capsize if you actully made the bottom rounded
help 2021-02-27 01:10:17 9 blocks wide is alright for a frigate
help 2021-02-27 01:12:45 no
help 2021-02-27 01:12:50 the ship itself irl isnt that big
help 2021-02-27 01:13:16 i cant place any blocks here
help 2021-02-27 01:14:31 that fixed it
help 2021-02-27 01:14:32 thanks
help 2021-02-27 01:19:56 the stern of the ship is a helicopte landing space and its lower than the other stuff so i made it only 2 blocks over the water
help 2021-02-27 01:20:02 its that enough?
help 2021-02-27 01:20:07 or should it be 3 blocks to be sure
help 2021-02-27 01:20:18 im scared that it will be under the water
help 2021-02-27 01:25:42 i just did and il raise it by 1 more block
help 2021-03-07 20:01:24 hey so uhhh i kinda wanna make a bomber zeppelin but i have no idea how to approach this project
help 2021-03-07 20:04:35 i know how il build the thing itself but how do i make it rise/sink
help 2021-03-07 20:04:44 do ballast tanks work outside water?
creations-chat 2021-03-18 16:15:04 Why is it so wide
creations-chat 2021-03-19 00:51:16 I kinda wanna start a new project but at the moment im way too lazy...
Maybe i should make a heli?
help 2021-04-05 21:08:14 so i have a missile inside my submarine that starts to wobble alot after a bit of flying it

i made the exact same missile outside the sub and it flies fine there. 

any ways to fix this? or is it just because the sub is big and causes lag wich might mess with the physics
help 2021-04-05 21:11:03 the missile that launches from the sub starts to wobble but you know what? i wanna make my sub fly now
help 2021-04-05 21:12:59 i switched out the super rocket engine with a normal one on the missile and now it flies fine? it used to fly fine with a super rocket engine before i put it in a submarine missile silo
help 2021-04-05 21:13:21 speed + lag + motors = bad i guess
help 2021-04-05 21:21:44 nevermind it still wobbles even after switching the s rocket engine with a normal one
help 2021-04-05 21:22:16 the missile works fine when not inside the sub
help 2021-04-05 21:22:26 but asoon as i launch it out of a sub
help 2021-04-05 21:22:30 it wobbles
help 2021-04-05 21:22:36 so lag makes things wobble?

help 2021-09-14 12:23:44 step 1 to me multistage anti sub missile is done, now i need a working torpedo. this one is absolute trash and just dies once it enters the water and dosent work unless its flat on the surface, i need it to be able to sink and roll properly, any tips?
help 2021-09-14 12:25:15 yeah the back ballast sinks first
help 2021-09-14 12:49:45 how
help 2021-09-14 12:49:45 well
help 2021-09-14 12:49:53 i cant really do that properly
help 2021-09-14 12:49:58 its attached to a missile
help 2021-09-14 12:51:16 i need it to be able to dive properly though
help 2021-09-14 12:51:46 it needs to be small
help 2021-09-14 12:51:52 and the weight cant be too big
help 2021-09-14 12:51:58 since the missile will be off balance
help 2021-09-14 12:52:23 il try to get it to work with ballast blocks
help 2021-09-14 12:53:51 well its also spinning
help 2021-09-14 12:53:53 wich is not good
help 2021-09-14 12:55:23 fixed the spinning
help 2021-09-14 12:57:27 now the rocket is underpowerd
help 2021-09-14 12:57:38 ballast block on 2 made the nose push down too much
help 2021-09-14 12:59:04 the torpedo works now
help 2021-09-14 12:59:21 but the missile dosent
help 2021-09-14 12:59:27 too much weight at the front
help 2021-09-14 12:59:36 the missile has 2 super rockets
help 2021-09-14 13:02:02 fixed the rocket up a bit
