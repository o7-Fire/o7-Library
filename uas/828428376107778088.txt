help 2021-08-30 01:33:41 check the weight distribution
help 2021-08-30 01:33:50 thats most likely the problem
help 2021-08-30 02:43:19 I have a SEVERE logic issue
help 2021-08-30 02:43:26 it is of the upmost importance
help 2021-08-30 02:43:39 the world as we know it depends on this one answer
help 2021-08-30 02:43:59 I have an escalator
help 2021-08-30 02:44:12 and I need to put a jar of mayo on it
help 2021-08-30 02:44:25 but the way it works
help 2021-08-30 02:44:44 in order to have the mayo welded to the escalator
help 2021-08-30 02:44:59 I would need to attach it to the actual step
help 2021-08-30 02:45:06 but
help 2021-08-30 02:45:17 
help 2021-08-30 02:45:41 they snap together and attaching the mayo to the bottom step sling shots it to the top
help 2021-08-30 02:45:59 and I cant put it farther down because the steps are flush against the bottom of the floor

creations-chat 2021-09-06 14:37:11 thanks for the upvote ðŸ˜„ but it just looked really fast when I tested it so I thought I would share the design for someone to test out
bug-reports 2021-09-06 15:25:56 get outta here with your scam
bug-reports 2021-09-06 15:33:02 welp my escalator works like butter when its unanchored. but its REALLY laggy. 
but then when I add an anchor block, the whole thing bugs out.
bug-reports 2021-09-06 15:33:52 
bug-reports 2021-09-06 15:34:16 sometimes it loads back
bug-reports 2021-09-06 15:34:28 but when it does the whole contraption is broken
bug-reports 2021-09-06 15:37:46 its an escalator for a reason lol
bug-reports 2021-09-06 15:38:08 also that was more just to report the problem rather than fixing it
bug-reports 2021-09-06 15:38:26 Im guessing it has something to do with the suspention
bug-reports 2021-09-06 16:15:21 huh

creations-chat 2021-10-17 15:19:46 yea lol I just wanted to have a working tie fighter
creations-chat 2021-11-18 16:34:32 Old. Not low effort.
creations-chat 2021-11-18 16:40:23 I was expecting less of an even split. surprising.
creations-chat 2021-11-18 16:44:23 It is Hawaiian pizza, although it doesn't fly. I do have one that does

Edit: LkaiBX2 shush
creations-chat 2021-11-18 16:49:34 lol. Just so you know that pizza has Canadian bacon and pineapple on it. Also pineapple on pizza is ok and can be good when paired with the right toppings.

Thank you ImaginTale
