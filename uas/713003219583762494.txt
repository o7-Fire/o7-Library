creations-chat 2022-07-01 18:44:04 <@706117664191414385> For this, what I would do is create a closed room with some sort of a museum feel and make some sort of platforms where u walk ontop of it, it would be really immerging for who ever is seeing it  `:D`
creations-chat 2022-07-01 18:47:00 I mean I like it because its creative and good, it makes me feel good when people use their creativity and create something good instead of looking at some cheep tutorial on a jet and use it for pvp
