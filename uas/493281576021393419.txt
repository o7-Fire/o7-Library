plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:14:16 cool plane
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 01:30:13 ur gonna need like 20 fingers to control it
plane-crazy 2020-06-26 07:00:43 wait, thats illegal
plane-crazy 2020-06-06 07:18:46 and the knowledge of locked motors
plane-crazy 2020-06-06 07:18:37 when you waste enough of your life on this game you suddenly gain the ability to build cool stuff
plane-crazy 2020-06-06 07:18:04 The carrier is cute
plane-crazy 2020-06-06 07:17:58 So many old building styles
plane-crazy 2020-06-06 07:17:48 lol
plane-crazy 2020-06-06 07:17:06 yeah the water is more like glue
plane-crazy 2020-06-06 07:16:01 how many block is plane
plane-crazy 2020-06-06 07:15:04 I sea
plane-crazy 2020-06-06 07:14:41 Das a good start
plane-crazy 2020-06-06 07:14:25 Like from different accounts
plane-crazy 2020-06-06 07:14:20 is there a way to lock 2 crafts together
plane-crazy 2020-06-06 07:11:17 ye
plane-crazy 2020-06-06 07:11:02 well atleat it’s not meant too
plane-crazy 2020-06-06 07:10:54 But that doesn’t fly
plane-crazy 2020-06-06 07:10:50 Some guy made a 12k block aircraft carrier I think
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 01:13:21 U need to make the front part the main part
plane-crazy 2020-05-22 03:50:11 how does i submit a suggestion
plane-crazy 2020-05-21 02:37:13 teams/factions is a good idea
plane-crazy 2020-05-21 02:36:07 so hopefully we get that oneday
plane-crazy 2020-05-21 02:36:01 its not impossible to hardcode a mirror mode
plane-crazy 2020-05-21 02:35:17 but maybe he'll change his mind one day
plane-crazy 2020-05-21 02:35:03 he already said he wont
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 23:56:22 np
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 23:55:57 although they r really small

plane-crazy 2020-05-19 07:03:47 lol
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 01:26:12 ok
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 01:25:25 im pretty sure the wing trail does that aswell
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 01:22:23 lol
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 01:05:20 the plane flys better when the wings are made entirely out of control surface
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 01:04:39 wait when did plane crazy go to mobile
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 00:33:19 rip
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 00:29:36 kk
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 00:29:07 do you need a specific rank for the vip servers or can it just b anything
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 00:24:46 in bot place
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 00:22:11 k
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 00:22:04 u trying to get a rank?
plane-crazy 2020-05-18 10:20:29 i joined a server and dont have a plot
plane-crazy 2020-05-18 09:49:42 i dont even know what happened here
plane-crazy 2020-05-18 09:12:31 from what i know fixing a hardcoded game is not that easy
plane-crazy 2020-05-18 08:46:21 lol rickje is probably having an aneurysm or something with all these bugs
plane-crazy 2020-05-18 08:39:13 whitelist teaser?
plane-crazy 2020-05-18 08:38:27 lol
plane-crazy 2020-05-18 08:36:19 i bet X Æ A-12 can read it

plane-crazy 2020-05-18 03:38:56 nice
plane-crazy 2020-05-18 01:57:12 it goes from very nice to thicc
plane-crazy 2020-05-18 01:38:53 ok
plane-crazy 2020-05-18 01:38:10 idk
plane-crazy 2020-05-18 01:38:02 maybe the wings aren't connected properly
plane-crazy 2020-05-18 01:36:04 its basically how strong the motor is
plane-crazy 2020-05-18 01:35:36 try reducing the torque as well
plane-crazy 2020-05-18 01:35:17 ye
plane-crazy 2020-05-18 01:34:16 whats the settings on the motor
plane-crazy 2020-05-18 01:15:58 and also motors and anchor blocks dont mix that well sometimes
plane-crazy 2020-05-18 01:15:32 what setting u got on the motors
plane-crazy 2020-05-18 00:03:44 lol
plane-crazy 2020-05-17 23:32:35 ok
plane-crazy 2020-05-17 23:27:31 building things 'to scale' is not as easy as originally anticipated
plane-crazy 2020-05-17 23:22:05 good idea imma add some cables to my carrier
plane-crazy 2020-05-17 23:10:04 kewl
plane-crazy 2020-05-17 23:07:12 ok
plane-crazy 2020-05-17 23:04:12 whats the servo option do on motor 2?
plane-crazy 2020-05-17 23:00:53 you'll get better as u go along
plane-crazy 2020-05-17 22:32:38 painting that must b painful
