help 2021-08-01 16:39:50 G'day lads. I was wondering if any of you could explain to me how to post my creations to "creations". I'm new around here.
help 2021-08-01 16:40:54 Right but i can't find the + icon to upload my files
help 2021-08-01 16:41:17 ah i see

creations-chat 2021-08-01 17:29:12 thanks for the kind words
creations-chat 2021-08-01 17:32:15 nothing wrong your opinion but the trashtalk is insane mate. What you have to show for it?
creations-chat 2021-08-01 17:37:54 Listen im new here i didn't know creations has this unwritten rule that you have to upload a masterpeace. I just made a jet within (as you said) a few minutes.(we can talk in priv if you want to)
creations-chat 2021-08-01 17:42:59 I thought that creations was where people share builds and just have a great time.Not a place where you upload an image and get critisized for it not being something that you aproove of. I don't want clout i dont want upvotes i just want to share a little jet i put together in a few minutes. I dont see any scummy tactics here...where do you?
creations-chat 2021-08-01 17:46:15 i have noticed, however you have not noticed that im new around here and i dont know a lot about the server. how about that?
creations-chat 2021-08-01 17:50:16 I get that, what i don't get is why so shallow critsism as "not well made" or "shitty". Feedback is what i wanted what i got was roasted haha. But for real do you beat up an infant bc it cant walk when its born? I hope you get the metafore.
creations-chat 2021-08-01 18:31:11 oh boy here we go

help 2023-01-18 20:33:42 
help 2023-01-18 20:33:45 like that
help 2023-01-18 20:34:50 adding wings usually works for me
help 2023-01-18 20:35:47 but then again it reduces maneuverabilty
help 2023-01-18 20:36:20 probably just a bunch of motors with every setting turned off

creations-chat 2023-01-24 21:10:30 i am new but, this is not constructive... you know that too
creations-chat 2023-01-24 21:14:56 I mean how hard can it be to explain that exposed motor and piston lock, as well as a blocky aesthetic doesn't look good...
