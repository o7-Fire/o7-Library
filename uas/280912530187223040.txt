help 2019-05-24 02:38:00 yo my rockets bug all the time
help 2019-05-24 02:38:11 when I start them the stop giving propulsion
help 2019-05-24 02:38:20 I use them in some missiles
help 2019-05-24 02:38:50 and whenever I dissconect them the missile stays still for some miliseconds and then falls with no propulsion being given by the rockets
help 2019-05-24 02:38:55 whyyyyyyyy
help 2019-05-24 02:40:04 I'm so frustratd of the hard work I've done in this big train and even more the engineering for the wheels and the missiles, and just now, things turn the oher side. I had never experienced this before, I even made other missiles in the same way and they worked perfectly

help 2019-05-24 02:44:20 theoretically, that mechanism wouldn't move..
help 2019-05-24 02:45:18 so what's up with my rockets?
help 2019-05-24 02:45:30 after they "turn off" they don't give any propulsion
help 2019-05-24 02:45:49 even if I start them or stop them repeatedly they won't give nothing
help 2019-05-24 02:46:00 same with on/off dissabled
