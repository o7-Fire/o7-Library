creations-chat 2020-11-01 19:30:56 100 Part Easy to control Wasp VTOL from Halo
creations-chat 2020-11-01 19:32:01 if i make them any bigger it looks ugly, so i just used the little ones for accuracy
why didnt it go on creations? is there a command for it
creations-chat 2020-11-01 19:48:28 yo whats wrong with the wasp
creations-chat 2020-11-01 19:49:31 <@456226577798135808> what's wrong with it
astf, that's because its 100 parts. its super small and i had to work with what i could get
it's probably 4 times the size of a robloxian so it fits the source material more accurately. its really small compared to your usual build, and i optimized it as much as possible
creations-chat 2020-11-01 19:50:41 what's motor lock
<@456226577798135808> i'll repeat myself, i made it small to fit the source material. plus, i specialize in really small builds
creations-chat 2020-11-01 19:51:42 i havent played this game in months but yeah i know what motor lock is, i had a different name for it though
however i have NO idea how to do it so ðŸ¤·
creations-chat 2020-11-01 19:53:56 older small builds
creations-chat 2020-11-01 19:55:03 yikes
creations-chat 2020-11-01 19:56:06 they're all from halo <@!724699963531198586>, all my builds are rather small and from halo 
holy fuck this slowmode is annoying
just edit ur previous message if u want to skip slowmode
creations-chat 2020-11-01 19:57:07 good fucking lord guys you like your motor lock dont you
motor lock is helpful sometimes but i kind of like the rough look on my little builds
creations-chat 2020-11-01 19:58:37 i've never used motorlock ever
which isnt actually something to brag about, i just dont fully understand how it works
creations-chat 2020-11-01 19:59:40 i legit havent played this game for ages
creations-chat 2020-11-01 20:01:02 i actually got 50-60 upvotes back when i posted the set of tiny halo vehicles, but it wasnt put in hall of fame because it was too "low effort" even though i spend hours on each one remodeling them over and over to get the details just right, and optimize the positioning/weight of it (which matters a lot more in small builds, especially vtols)
creations-chat 2020-11-01 20:02:13 i did, vilde
but the team considered it too low effort to be in hall of fame despite having well over the required upvotes
wrong post. i dont think it was the 6 part it might have been the 4 part
creations-chat 2020-11-01 20:03:50 it may not have been 60, but at the time 40 was the required upvotes for hof <@!655236433501618180> i dont know if it still is because i havent been back in a while

v i feel that
creations-chat 2020-11-01 20:04:51 low effort my asssssss dude
go for it dude cool ship

worlds weirdest flight system that is actually super easy to control
the fat thing in the middle turns it by spinning left or right
and the propellers do all the movement
creations-chat 2020-11-01 20:09:17 <@!368581738496131072> cool build but what does that have to do with me

creations-chat 2020-11-01 20:15:34 i think a tiny vtol is an accomplishment, do you have any idea how hard it was to perfect the weight/balance

<@!724699963531198586> at least 2 hours of balancing it out perfectly
tiny vtols are super hard
creations-chat 2020-11-01 20:20:09 https://gyazo.com/0778bdc4cebb090b8587602d1a8984d0
for size comparison
<@!655236433501618180> send pic
creations-chat 2020-11-01 20:21:11 the main body is only 3 blocks wide so i had to fit basically everything in there
creations-chat 2020-11-01 20:22:40 thats rather large chief
also thats not a vtol
just edit ur message to ignore slowmode
ok
creations-chat 2020-11-01 20:23:41 fucks a lift fan
dont breh me. im not an ultra nerd like you guys
creations-chat 2020-11-01 20:31:51 <@!655236433501618180> cool vibes but 
1. my hornet uses upforce to move forwards and backwards, along with hovering 
2. too thicc 4 me
