help 2022-08-18 22:14:25 How do I stabilize a build that keeps shaking when going higher speeds
help 2022-08-18 22:14:35 Is there a way to keep the high speeds but reduce the shaking?
help 2022-08-18 22:17:53 A single wing panel or a 1x4?
help 2022-08-18 22:20:31 It works
help 2022-08-18 22:20:34 Thanks for the help
help 2022-08-19 21:11:40 How do I fix the shaking on this plane without losing more speed / mobility?
I've put wing panels in the nose, in the body itself, and wings on the middile reduce speed greatly but it doesn't help stabilize it (Using 6 hover drives)

If losing speed is required to stabilize it I will try, but want to see if there are better methods before going that route.
