bug-reports 2020-01-09 22:16:04 I picked up the SparklePop but no matter what, I can't find it anywhere, people told me it was here but it isn't. I can't re-pick it up either since I got the message "You got SparklePop" before

bug-reports 2020-01-10 15:58:06 Even though I picked it up
bug-reports 2020-01-10 15:58:30 <@!510867573257273354> I think that's a problem with your computer

bug-reports 2020-01-12 18:33:57 Sometimes you slowly fall when on the Jetpack, sometimes you slowly go up, sometimes you stay in the same place. Sometimes you can't even equip it too.

creations-chat 2020-07-29 02:03:50 Eh, I think my car is good. People just seem to have incredibly extremely high standards and downvote anything that's not a giant plane
creations-chat 2021-04-12 21:38:27 Can I ask why you downvoted? I appreciate feedback rather than just trolls downvoting everything they see.

bug-reports 2021-05-12 03:01:16 Problem. When 3 or more motors are attached to eachother. It becomes a limp elephant trunk  (motor 2's). How do I fix this? Yes, the strength of the motors is all the way up
bug-reports 2021-05-12 03:01:22 Yet when I remove ONE motor. Everything is fixed.
bug-reports 2021-05-12 03:01:27 These are motor 2's
bug-reports 2021-05-12 03:02:54 Oh, I mean't
bug-reports 2021-05-12 03:03:11 When  TWO motor 2's are attached. Then a regular motor on top makes them limp
bug-reports 2021-05-12 03:05:09 And I think it's funny that rickje's old bio said "motors aren't  glitched" xD
bug-reports 2021-05-12 18:26:49 Here I'll explain in more detail now that I have more time. (i appreciate the help btw)

I have a BIIIG tank, and ontop of the tank shell is two BIIIIIG guns. However, the 2 guns are attached onto one platform using a motor 2. So the 2 big guns don't move independently, secondly, each big gun has it's own motor 2 to aim them (independently). That right there is 3 motor 2's. However, that itself works perfectly fine. But the very moment I put any kind of motor PAST the second set of motor 2's...it goes haywire. Even if I only put one motor of any kind (1 or 2), that single gun goes limp, yet the other one without the extra motor is stiff as a- leg. Confusing I know.
bug-reports 2021-05-12 18:27:34 Okay
bug-reports 2021-05-12 18:27:48 That's fine. I was simply explaining in more detail
bug-reports 2021-05-12 18:28:11 Alrighty then
bug-reports 2021-05-12 18:28:38 I'm on my Chromebook right now, otherwise I would just send a screenshot of the tank
bug-reports 2021-05-12 18:29:49 I was just explaining why I couldn't send a screenshot.
bug-reports 2021-05-12 18:29:59 No, not google play enabled.
bug-reports 2021-05-12 18:30:03 Or linux enabled)
bug-reports 2021-05-12 18:30:24 One of the first models of chromebook, yes.
bug-reports 2021-05-12 18:30:48 Pshhh. I dunno dude. Tricky question.
bug-reports 2021-05-12 18:30:58 I would just send a screenshot of the tank if it was gp enabled
bug-reports 2021-05-12 18:31:10 God no.
bug-reports 2021-05-12 18:31:13 Good god no
bug-reports 2021-05-12 18:31:22 Barely even YouTube at 1920x1080
bug-reports 2021-05-12 18:31:36 The Bluetooth feature just blew out
bug-reports 2021-05-12 18:31:40 Yep.
bug-reports 2021-05-12 18:31:55 Yep, 1gb of ram
bug-reports 2021-05-12 18:32:04 Athlon or Pentium process
bug-reports 2021-05-12 18:32:07 -or
bug-reports 2021-05-12 18:32:38 I have an entire windows computer upstairs.
bug-reports 2021-05-12 18:32:40 No no.
bug-reports 2021-05-12 18:33:00 I have another computer, I'm simply doing chrome work right now. The windows machine is in use
bug-reports 2021-05-12 18:33:24 Lol oh god no roblox on this fossil?
bug-reports 2021-05-12 18:33:47 oh and I do have another bug
bug-reports 2021-05-12 18:33:50 It's much easier to explain
bug-reports 2021-05-12 18:34:22 So I have this V-Tol that works actually really great.
bug-reports 2021-05-12 18:34:46 I have 4 motor 2's sticking out from a single block that turn a helicopter wing panel exactly 30 degrees
bug-reports 2021-05-12 18:35:02 and I have a second regular motor spinning at max speed and strength
bug-reports 2021-05-12 18:35:09 However
bug-reports 2021-05-12 18:35:47 Once I make the panels turn 30 degrees, they go all the way to the 30 degrees. But when I turn on the SPEED, they lose that 30 and go down to like...10 or 15
bug-reports 2021-05-12 18:35:55 Once the speed goes off, it goes back up to 30.
bug-reports 2021-05-12 18:36:15 The thing is, this Vtol worked perfectly last week, and I load it up yesterday and it's completely useless.
bug-reports 2021-05-12 18:36:39 and what do you know? there are more than 3 motors
bug-reports 2021-05-12 18:37:05 But.
bug-reports 2021-05-12 18:37:26 It looks a LOT like wind resistance...and it just worked last week. There wasn't some motor overhaul for wind resistance?
bug-reports 2021-05-12 18:38:37 I actually have footage of it completely working, then not working.
bug-reports 2021-05-12 18:38:49 and yes, I have the footage on me...Do you want to take a look?
bug-reports 2021-05-12 18:38:59 You do not have to if you don't want to
help 2021-05-12 18:42:32 Is that a gun or an entire ship?
help 2021-05-12 18:43:03 Looks like something out of half life alyx...You could make the entire side panel and just attach it using the traditional motor lock method?
bug-reports 2023-05-24 21:52:29 currently have this issue...i literally cannot join a pvp server
bug-reports 2023-05-24 21:54:14 how can i fix this?
