creations-chat 2023-02-26 22:18:59 <@375281006091173890> any feedback
creations-chat 2023-02-26 22:29:47 thank you. actual constructive critisism unlike <@765318482753224704> who says "it‚Äôs ass, that‚Äôs my feedback", i appreciate this and will work on improving the paint job on this build very soon, that was sort of what i thought would end up being bad about the build, not too great with stuff like that yk
creations-chat 2023-02-26 22:33:14 so what about it is ass? i would like to fix the issues with it that i at the time was unable to think of any others than the paint job which i will work on, that is why i posted it
creations-chat 2023-02-26 22:35:46 okay, thank you, is there anything else other than the paint you have any feedback on?
creations-chat 2023-02-26 22:39:14 no reason to delete it, it'll stay there, thank you for your concern i appreciate it very much
creations-chat 2023-02-26 22:45:55 bro really resent his message because nobody cared üíÄ (its the right reply)
creations-chat 2023-02-26 23:03:53 yes, i know, do you have any detailed/specific feedback?
creations-chat 2023-02-26 23:06:13 accurate representation of all pcc feedback
creations-chat 2023-02-26 23:08:17 okay, thank you, all the feedback (like 3 people) have all said that so i will be looking into it. i appreciate it thank you
creations-chat 2023-02-26 23:36:57 okay, i'll go with you're too lazy to give me feedback on how i could improve it, i deeply apologize if i have caused you any pain from seeing my horrendous build, have a great rest of your day
creations-chat 2023-02-26 23:39:37 as i have previously said, i am aware of this and im working on this build to improve it with said feedback. 
(also, side note, <@781989929076523009>, you aren't hard *nor* funny)
creations-chat 2023-02-26 23:41:42 further proves my point to the fact that you're lazy
creations-chat 2023-02-27 01:52:13 yeah i get what u mean, im gonna delete it rn so people dont give me anymore feedback cuz its all the same lol, im working on it rn (deleting because im making it completely different)

help 2023-03-04 17:09:31 any shorter and it wouldnt look good
help 2023-03-04 17:09:45 even if that means its not exactly like the irl one

help 2023-03-04 17:10:24 from the window outline to the back wheel it looks the same distance though
help 2023-03-04 17:10:45 if i made it taller it  would be proportionate
help 2023-03-04 17:10:55 but i dont think its horrible how it is rn
