explosion mode
other 
explosion mode would be a setting you turn on, and when you do the planes would explode if you crash. it would be like when you fly through the propeller on the floating island. you crash into the ground? your ship falls apart. land without landig gear? ship falls apart. it would make the game more challenging for people who want to make realistic planes, or if they are doing a flying challenge. so they would have to land carefully.
