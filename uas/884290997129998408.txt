creations-chat 2022-05-09 20:57:41 making this to be mini attack coaxial helicopter like ka52
creations-chat 2022-05-09 20:59:31 any ways to make it better ?
creations-chat 2022-05-09 21:28:12 i decided to revert from making it a coaxial rotor to a vtol with like futuristic v22 engines, pls any tips for making it look better
creations-chat 2022-05-09 21:30:17 ill make tail longer, and give it 2 tilted vertical stabilizers
aight ill stretcc
creations-chat 2022-05-09 21:36:30 i put half blocks on the sides to widen and also cover up some of the exposed motors
creations-chat 2022-05-09 21:55:40 this has gotta be one of the most confusing builds ive ever made
creations-chat 2022-05-09 21:57:37 i rlly like how it looks so far but theres some tweaks i still gotta do (its rlly small)
creations-chat 2022-05-09 22:01:07 yes lmao, im in public
creations-chat 2022-05-09 22:25:51 added some hover engines just to test how stabile it flies, living how it looks so far
creations-chat 2022-05-09 22:28:58 any other suggestion to make better (except of hiding the motor lock cuz idk how)

creations-chat 2022-05-10 01:01:51 girls youre all pretty pls shut up
creations-chat 2022-05-10 04:20:14 which is better coaxial or vtol (coaxial is intented purpose
creations-chat 2022-05-10 04:29:48 single rotor
creations-chat 2022-05-20 05:05:52 i made this rotor system thats alot more stabile than the other rotor systems i use because the blades arent providing upwards lift the hover engine above motor is
im prob gonna put this on the other helis i make idk
creations-chat 2022-05-20 05:07:44 its alot more stabile because small adjustments in the rotor blades tilts dont happen and it doesnt go totally haywire when you try to make it go up, it also looks rlly satisfying when its spinning cause it doesnt have any overengineered rotor characteristics
creations-chat 2022-05-20 05:09:58 i did tests where a car hit the rotor while it was going up and it didnt spin out of control it kinda just corrected itself
creations-chat 2022-05-20 05:11:44 im prob gonna use it for that lol, thinking on making tiny pvp ka-50
creations-chat 2022-05-20 05:20:20 i mean yeah now that i think about it your rotor can be taken out and you will still fly fine (or atleast should)
creations-chat 2022-05-20 05:22:47 im in the middle of grinding a game but i should be done with it in a couple days and then ill make a full prototype with a full body, I will definitely dm you or ping you when if i need help though!
creations-chat 2022-05-20 05:27:08 tbh its astonishing that the community values looks/complexity of the build more than the effort that the player put into it
creations-chat 2022-05-20 05:29:15 new player spends 5 hours on a build then makes the mistake of putting it in creations just to be ridiculed lmao
creations-chat 2022-05-20 05:31:47 rip man that sucks
creations-chat 2022-05-21 20:01:31 im making a AH-1 as a test for my rotor blade, is this good ?? i spent less than an hour on it but its rlly just a prototype
im gonna work on the tail rotor rn
creations-chat 2022-05-21 23:22:13 rotor system is a block wide and hidden by a ton of wing panels (idk how i made it a block wide and it works perfectly lol
creations-chat 2022-05-21 23:37:27 white name moment
creations-chat 2022-05-21 23:39:38 i will record a video of the slight movements in a sec

<@287454032250011649> I have an anchor block placed on it but thats only for when im motor locking it, if i dont it'll fall on its side and go haywire because the rotor spins automatically (hover engines) , but i'll make video of me spawning it and etc
creations-chat 2022-05-22 00:04:13 https://streamable.com/z2z0h2 
I tried about 10-11 times to correctly motor lock it without the extremely sensitive rotors hitting the ground and every single time the rotor hit the ground, and was unevenly angled. Im going to post a video of me doing it with anchor block and motor locking it in the air to show you the difference between the two.
creations-chat 2022-05-22 00:12:29 https://streamable.com/89i021 <@287454032250011649> this is with being anchored in the air and correctly motor locking it without ruining the stability of the rotor.
I also love how you guys are making fun of me purely by assumptions that im using anchor blocks to hover
creations-chat 2022-05-22 00:15:41 bro i literally made it as a prototype for the rotor blades and spent less than an hour and a half on it 🗿 <@287454032250011649>

creations-chat 2022-05-22 01:28:51 i dont rlly like making my builds wider than 1 block cause its just more work, also i keep my builds under 300 blocks most of the time
creations-chat 2022-05-22 03:10:10 https://streamable.com/lmeyxx comically large rotor with same ability to hover <:Troll:908238393085943878>

creations-chat 2022-05-22 04:08:31 https://streamable.com/4mobwb I made the comically long rotor blades longer, its still hovering like its impossible. should i make the blades longer <:Troll:908238393085943878>
creations-chat 2022-05-22 04:16:58 theres 2 ways of upwards thrust/lift, theres hidden hover engines above motors that have seperate controls than the actual rotor blades to have like a backup rotor and it helps balance out the thrust of the helicopter perfectly. and then theres the normal rotor that kinda just does normal rotor stuff
creations-chat 2022-05-22 04:19:14 the hover engines are directly under the rotor so its just for more thrust but it balances out the helicopter insanely. the engines are hidden by wing panels and they just require small increases of power to balance. its also why everyone refused to believe that i wasnt using anchor block since its rlly balanced when hovering
creations-chat 2022-05-22 04:20:56 that is the rotor system, the hover engines are supposed to provide more power for the rotors and the one being at the back evens it
creations-chat 2022-05-22 04:23:12 This is proof theres only 4 hover thrusters.
and I usually use hover engines to power my rotors because they make it spin alot faster and alot smoother than motors do, cause you can make it look like youre powering up your engine. Hover thrusters make your rotors spin at 400 speed i think?? or something like that
its overall more satisfying to me using hover thrusters tbh
creations-chat 2022-05-22 04:28:14 also hover thrusters can alternate in rpm and it makes it alot easier to add collective / reduce collective simply by slowing down the rotors, since in this game if you try to change the rotors angle while theyre at full speed the motors go crazy and the rotors obtain a mind of their own <@434843195025653762>
creations-chat 2022-05-22 04:33:49 lol i would love if rick fixed them it'd be rlly awesome having seamless rotors
creations-chat 2022-05-22 04:58:29 hi ya ik lol, how u been, thats awesome! aight im adding it rn

creations-chat 2022-05-22 05:16:09 man i literally went though this already
creations-chat 2022-05-22 05:19:13 I have one anchor block, its used for being able to lock the motors in the correct spots (since they're all custom angled)
I will post all the videos again.
https://streamable.com/z2z0h2 (without anchor for motor locking)
https://streamable.com/89i021 (with anchor for motor locking) 
https://streamable.com/wwkecy (small movements while hovering)
if you want me to record a video of the difference between hovering without anchor and with anchor i can totally do that as im hovering above my friends build rn
creations-chat 2022-05-22 05:23:32 If i dont have the anchor block the helicopter tips over on its side and the rotor becomes a uneven angle from the other one making it extremely unstabile before i can even lock the motors correctly (the landing skids also become uneven)
creations-chat 2022-05-22 05:27:51 <@622531211499143178> this is the version with comically long rotors but they both preform the exact same way https://streamable.com/ycu0ji This is without anchor block
creations-chat 2022-05-22 05:29:35 https://streamable.com/t5ggs2 This is with anchor block and physics enabled (see how theres alot less movement)

creations-chat 2022-05-22 13:07:03 da mini blackhawk
creations-chat 2022-05-22 13:17:04 i feel like its a tad bit too long

help 2022-05-22 20:54:57 it doesn't need a counter spin, you take two motors put one in bottom one on top with both powered off and they both spin freely
help 2022-05-22 20:56:04 the bottom motor cancels out the counter spin

creations-chat 2022-05-29 13:16:47 i would say 4 or 5, 6 might work
creations-chat 2022-05-29 13:24:54 the nose should be a tad bit longer (by like 2 blocks) then theres the part that follows behind the canopy

creations-chat 2022-07-06 12:04:54 im making an f16 and i just wanna ask if these wings look too big or if its just me
creations-chat 2022-07-06 12:07:28 still contemplating what the nose should look like + i havent finished the alerons just put them there so i can see wing scale
OH LMAO
creations-chat 2022-07-06 12:11:32 trying to figure out how to add blueprint to it, only done it once over a year ago

my brain is telling me to bring the wings backward half a block and make them a block shorter
you can overlay
creations-chat 2022-07-06 12:15:37 the plane veers left cause theres a spring stuck inside it
can take a wider screenshot if u want
creations-chat 2022-07-06 12:18:36 thank you
ill fix wings and shit rn
creations-chat 2022-07-07 10:33:24 just finished my f-16 (ignore paint, im working on it)
pls feedback
took about a day of brain mush
creations-chat 2022-07-07 17:32:24 no ❤️
creations-chat 2022-07-07 17:35:09 i would try to do that but i managed to be such a dumb fuck that i made this thing as compact as possible so i cant modify the canopy without completely redesigning the upper portion of the fuselage (which i can totally do in a matter of like 3 hours, but ive been awake for like 8 hours doing this shit)
will prob try in like 8-12 hours
creations-chat 2022-07-07 17:42:22 oh yeah btw a majority of it is custom angled
creations-chat 2022-07-07 17:49:33 intake from control surface is too fat (tried that first and sat for an hour trying to find a good design for intake but got lazy) for the fuselage + 1.5 is sorta goofy in my brain soz bro
honestly i could get a good intake design for it from my friend but hes been offline for a while so id have to contact him
creations-chat 2022-07-07 18:10:22 lol what
creations-chat 2022-07-10 23:44:47 its 1.4 blocks wide
creations-chat 2022-07-11 00:01:44 real

creations-chat 2022-07-18 11:34:03 increase the landing gear height by like a block or two cuz that thing would snap faster than a stick
creations-chat 2022-07-18 11:36:19 btw l1011???
that is a rlly fucked up a320 nose ngl
creations-chat 2022-07-18 11:38:51 yeah incrase the gear size by a block cause a320 hase insane ground clearance and also bring the nose forward cuz that looks rlly goofy
creations-chat 2022-07-18 11:41:58 id say bring the nose forward a block and make the nose connect to the windshield at a less steep angle
that would look rlly good with how the a320s nose is shaped so yeah ig might be a little pain in the ass to make into shape though
creations-chat 2022-07-18 11:49:11 LMFAOOOOOOOOO
ok maybe try custom angle + piston lockcause that doesnt look very normal
bring it back half a block and keep the tip of the nose in a similiar shape but def fix the angling 😭 😭
creations-chat 2022-07-18 11:53:38 make the top of the nose at steeper angle and bottom of the nose at a more rounded angle but not steep
i would say try to fit custom angling in there but maybe if it works yeah
that would actually work i think
creations-chat 2022-07-18 11:57:55 ok lol anything but that unholy nose
real
creations-chat 2022-07-19 02:41:59 no that looks fine

creations-chat 2022-08-14 23:43:48 pls guys rate the nose (737)
creations-chat 2022-08-14 23:47:40 mr sir 90% of the motor locking is hidden behind those windows and there is 0 space for any detail (plus it looks hella stupid with clear windows)
creations-chat 2022-08-14 23:51:34 real
<@447788748495650816> I have a completely different motorlocking style then you and I have made this thing as compact as possible (as i usually do) because im leaving room for very detailed wings
creations-chat 2022-08-14 23:54:18 ^^^
its really easy to make very insane exterior detail when you dont need to focus on interior
creations-chat 2022-08-15 00:05:14 ty for approving seed i appreciate it alot
also <@447788748495650816> i can definitely make a fully detailed cabin just not the cockpit cause there isnt nearly enough room
creations-chat 2022-08-15 00:15:40 idk if its roscale but i appreciate the feedback
creations-chat 2022-08-15 00:30:33 idk i think its a little small for roscale but if it is thats great
creations-chat 2022-08-15 00:35:01 (i wasnt trying to make it roscale anyway just using an old nose design)
creations-chat 2022-08-15 00:55:36 mr sir planes are huge
60 tons of metal isnt small
creations-chat 2022-08-15 00:58:45 i spend a lot of time on the ramp at a pretty nicely sized airport and even general aviation planes are bigger than most cars you see
creations-chat 2022-08-15 01:02:12 Boeing 737
even a beechcraft bonanza is big compared to a person (like a person standing next to a mini school bus)
creations-chat 2022-08-15 01:05:13 real
creations-chat 2022-08-15 01:09:25 1 and have every single writing/detail on it
creations-chat 2022-08-15 01:12:35 yeah its not roscale cause its 6 blocks tall and 6 blocks wide
<@996799001858940988> i've stood next to the planes that youre talking about and they are absolutely huge (im 5'11)
creations-chat 2022-08-15 01:14:41 ive stood about 5 ft from a 737 and ive also flown on them, theyre pretty big
i do aviation photography and i fly general aviation.
ive also stood under a 787 and not been able to touch the fuselage (planes are huge)
creations-chat 2022-08-15 01:19:01 my point is that airplanes, especially airliners are NOT small at all while also giving my credibility on the topic
<@456226577798135808> also yeah the gun doesnt even stretch back halfway of the a-10s fuselage either
creations-chat 2022-08-15 01:23:11 ive updated my 737 nose ❤️
creations-chat 2022-08-15 01:26:00 <@581220756697120805> im pretty sure u can help this guy (i forgot if it was you who had the hueyvenom)

7x7
creations-chat 2022-08-17 03:00:25 7 blocks by 7 blocks and looks something like this (theres not much i can edit on the nose without remaking the entire plane)
creations-chat 2022-08-17 03:03:05 im not restarting fresh (ive been working on this for about 5-4 days now) + it looks fine not a big deal
creations-chat 2022-08-17 03:05:37 just to give you an idea on how terribly i decided to lock this (literally the entire body is locked in the nose)
and on the making it more round thing that is the same thing as starting fresh cause i gotta re make the nose into the fuselage + less room for detail
creations-chat 2022-08-17 08:19:35 737-800 body that ive been working on for the last couple of days, gonna start working on the wings and landing gears now that im done with the body
anything I should add?? note: the hump near the vertical stab is the wifi bump so dont go off on me "omg you need to fix that hump !!1111!!!1!!"
my friend <@876288263386714163> made me a pro engine design so cant wait to see how that looks (he also helped on things like doors)

creations-chat 2022-08-17 11:30:37 idk why but it kinda looks cooler as a high wing its so weird
also yes a little high (only 4 blocks)
creations-chat 2022-08-17 11:37:47 heres a bit of constructive criticism:
that looks so shit i suggest you delete it and look at other players noses and take inspiration from it (very constructive)
creations-chat 2022-08-17 11:41:51 im almost done with my 737 wings pls tell me if i should make them bigger/smaller cause honestly idk

creations-chat 2022-08-18 05:20:00 rate the dog <@401530469952389130>
creations-chat 2022-08-18 05:26:46 they somehow made the F-35 more effective at ground attack then a-10 however its less accessible to ground troops
(higher payload capacity + most technologically advanced airplane on earth)
creations-chat 2022-08-18 05:32:24 mostly only cause F-35 can carry 18000 lbs of combined weapons while a-10 only does 15-16k
<@401530469952389130> yeah F-35 isnt very efficient at ground strikes but very precise, while a-10 can circle around the target for a long time because higher range capability
creations-chat 2022-08-18 05:36:25 no we have healthcare, it just costs as much as beverly hills real estate
creations-chat 2022-08-18 05:41:23 yeah its kinda insane but yk we need nuclear carriers all over the ocean
making life easier for your citizens? no how about 700+ billion dollar military budget!
creations-chat 2022-08-18 05:43:25 we need to kill them communist fish
honestly i wouldnt be mad if arsenal bird was created that would be hella hype
creations-chat 2022-08-18 05:45:59 if it was nuclear like in the game it wouldnt need a runway (nuclear power can keep a plane going for over 1000 years)
supply planes getting shot down like on that one mission
creations-chat 2022-08-18 05:49:13 yeah prob around the same time (im a fucking idiot mb)
but prob a bit longer cause carriers are made out of metal and weigh an absolute fuck ton while most aircraft are made out of extremely light materials like carbon fiber, just guessing tho
creations-chat 2022-08-18 05:51:59 my g f35 goes through 27k USD per hour and f-16 goes through 7k USD what are you smoking

creations-chat 2022-08-20 00:39:25 prob one of the better f-4s ive seen
creations-chat 2022-08-20 00:42:27 ngl i still prefer 1 block over wider cause most of the time the wider ones be ugly as shit, but alot more of the better 1 blocks are very satisfying
for fighter jets only tho
examples: 
ritualfishy f-14 (before remade)
fuzzythewookie f16
landruy_eater a-10
creations-chat 2022-08-20 00:47:06 rituals F-14 before he remade it was pretty good
also fuzzy's f-16 was 1 block

<@567763933952475157> theres a lot more imperfections on wider fighter jets like open spaces between angle locks because not enough room
example: ThatOne_Bloke's f-35 nose.
<@883063424614006878> its literally his f-16 with a different paint job and wing (he fucking says it in his post)

creations-chat 2022-09-09 08:15:52 you spent a couple months of your life for a plane thats too laggy to fly

<@876288263386714163> sadly knows what im talking about (rip f-14)
creations-chat 2022-09-09 08:31:43 still one of the most accurate F-14s ive seen in the game even though you cant spawn it
creations-chat 2022-09-09 08:35:18 no wings
creations-chat 2022-09-09 08:52:23 its two wide
creations-chat 2022-09-09 09:07:32 they smooth 🥶
creations-chat 2022-09-09 09:55:54 
creations-chat 2022-09-09 10:03:14 wait something feels weird about that

F-22 nose is 2 wide and the nose width is similar
creations-chat 2022-09-09 10:24:45 a roblox stud is 0.28M and a block is 2.5 studs wide
meaning 2 blocks is 1.4M (which is 4.59FT)
the widest point of f-14s nose is around 3.8-4FT 
your calculation of 3 wide is 6.8FT
youre hilariously off its under two wide technically

sorry if it took me a minute to respond was calculating
https://devforum.roblox.com/t/how-many-studs-is-there-in-a-meter/103417 if u wanna confirm for urself
creations-chat 2022-09-09 10:32:28 nah but 7ft wide f-14 and f-22 when
creations-chat 2022-09-09 10:34:41 i thought we were talking about accuracy here

superxenonfirezz accuracy W once again 💪
creations-chat 2022-09-09 10:37:43 bro evaluated the accuracy of a fighter jet off of 3 nose facing photos
creations-chat 2022-09-09 10:42:46 if it was 3 wide it would take up most of the space between both of the vertical stabilizers
remember that 3 wide is 7 ft

we were talking about accuracy (how wide the jets nose is)

help 2022-09-10 02:31:33 so what im trying to do is add in trails on the outlines of the wings 
cant rlly do that without camera lock and idk how to do camera lock correctly + i dont think i have enough room to add motors to motor lock them in there

anything i should add/work on?
creations-chat 2022-09-10 07:02:00 should i angle the nose down?

alr ill angle the nose down and add trap doors on the bottom
creations-chat 2022-09-10 07:15:47 ok i angled the nose downbut i didnt make the nose wider cause it removed the wedge thing above the intake and thats a piece of detail i like having there
now i feel like the canopy is too large lol

<@876288263386714163> this thing is a gigantic improvement from my other one
creations-chat 2022-09-10 07:19:04 this is how it looks now with the nose angled and i like it more
more accurate spacing between nose and intake but the canopy is overpowering now
creations-chat 2022-09-10 07:39:41 i tried this and didnt rlly like how it looked, it looks weird cause the nose is 1 wide at its thinnest point
creations-chat 2022-09-10 08:17:31 canopy is big yeah i agree but i dont see anything with the intake

creations-chat 2022-09-18 02:45:31 tuff luck for him, still a hot falken 🙂

<@699681364731232456> make the canopy pop out a bit more it looks like it has a tumor
creations-chat 2022-09-18 02:49:46 if you can fit another piston lock or too try to move the canopy up like .3 of a block and then try to blend the spine into the vertical stabilizer by possibly using camera lock w half circles & half blocks locked into the bottom half. 
hope you got enough space 4 it tho

nvm as i can see youre an expert at compactness like me and its going to be like fixing a deloreans engine to add stuff into that
creations-chat 2022-09-18 02:52:32 i've taken 3 months to fit 690 blocks into a 20 by 7 block tall structure F16

creations-chat 2022-09-25 13:18:35 roscale

you suck at taking jokes
creations-chat 2022-09-25 13:20:45 my honest reaction to that information
creations-chat 2022-09-25 14:55:42 mounted the props & rudder + painted the superstructure
two things left to do
1. blend the midship hull into bow 
2. make uscg livery
creations-chat 2022-09-25 15:01:20 i dont know i might make bow just a block and a half longer and motor lock the area infront of bridge a lil more
just so it doesnt look clumped

if i make it any longer i fear that i will have to make new camera locks
creations-chat 2022-09-25 15:07:18 add some more detail
creations-chat 2022-09-25 15:18:21 headlights
add a ⚫ sign near the back of the turret for shell ejection 
possibly engine exhaust if theres not already
repair supplies

if it fits
creations-chat 2022-09-25 15:22:34 nice, Goodluck
creations-chat 2022-09-25 15:30:03 i extended it, will send screenshot here in a sec just fixing something]

creations-chat 2022-09-25 15:33:36 <@678986403153182772> longer bow

creations-chat 2022-09-25 15:40:52 just realised that the mast is fucked up and i kinda wanna scream

<@514333972189151233> yes

creations-chat 2022-10-01 01:10:04 a330 neo

a330 has upgraded version called trent-7000
creations-chat 2022-10-01 01:12:50 no trent 7000 is a little bit bigger (284cm compared to trent 700s 247cm fans)
creations-chat 2022-10-01 01:14:57 since your a330 is a 200 variant yes 
youd have to make it longer for neo iirc (even though neo is superior)
creations-chat 2022-10-01 01:17:17 a330-800 yea
creations-chat 2022-10-01 01:20:39 <@876288263386714163> plus air greenland has the a330-800
