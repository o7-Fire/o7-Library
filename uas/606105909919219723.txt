creations-chat 2020-09-25 02:12:39 Not really, <@456226577798135808> , could use a runway tho

Welll..... Not in that sense
creations-chat 2020-09-25 02:13:25 you said it was a carrier?
creations-chat 2020-09-25 02:14:02 If it was a VTOL aircraft carrier a runway would be neccessary, or a catapult
creations-chat 2020-09-25 02:15:23 Sure, but a catapult may be more space efficient. Or, if you really wanted a runway, you could flatten the top, and put a hangar lift from the hangar onto it
creations-chat 2020-09-25 02:15:41 but it's your choice, Really cool so far Nick!
creations-chat 2022-05-03 10:04:37 tried it, became a submarine.

creations-chat 2022-05-03 10:34:34 I have a more recent ship that's better and that i'll post like tomorrow.
