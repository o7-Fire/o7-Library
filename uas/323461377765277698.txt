creations-chat 2019-06-07 03:48:45 Another micro plane for the Microscopic Engineer role... Kinda hard to control but should be good for the job... the propeller at the back has reverse thrust on...

bug-reports 2019-07-23 00:48:00 is it ok if i post a quick video clip of my bug?
bug-reports 2019-07-23 00:48:14 or does it have to be gyazo or something like that?
bug-reports 2019-07-23 00:54:02 anyways, I find these 2 things with the motor pretty annoying... 1st is the motors rotate on their own when launching your creation and 2 the motors can get really shaky when they have the reset thing on.
bug-reports 2019-07-23 01:03:33 This is a clip of the motors moving when not supposed to at launch
bug-reports 2019-07-23 01:04:05 and this is a clip of the motors shaking hard when they have the reset box checked
bug-reports 2019-07-23 01:18:04 no
bug-reports 2019-07-23 01:18:15 should i have it on?

creations-chat 2020-08-11 17:58:59 I tried making a BT-5 from scratch without tutorials, unoriginal probably but im happy with the results
bug-reports 2020-08-21 19:10:05 this is just a clip of the bug the person above was talking about, roblox runs perfectly fine until you move your creation. there's also nothing that appears in the debug logs on roblox right when roblox crashes
bug-reports 2020-08-22 03:15:41 ye it is, its the liset prime
