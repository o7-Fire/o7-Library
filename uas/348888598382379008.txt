bug-reports 2019-12-26 01:16:01 I want to report that motor2 always glitch in my heavy creations, this could be related to low fps. (It always glitches when I get low frames / ~50fps)
bug-reports 2019-12-26 01:16:51 We all know it, thats sad.
bug-reports 2019-12-26 01:17:32 The problem is, I didn't created anything that can fly with motor2.
bug-reports 2019-12-26 01:17:54 It works perfectly for me while I'm with normal fps rate.
