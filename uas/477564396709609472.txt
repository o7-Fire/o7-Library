help 2022-06-24 02:33:19 Anyone think they have a solution? I added over a thousand new blocks to a massive 19k block build (making it 20k blocks) and when I rejoined, all new backup saves and progress through the entirety of the day has been completely wiped. I cannot find a way to recover this, is there a solution?
help 2022-06-24 02:36:20 One way or another, I'm getting that back
