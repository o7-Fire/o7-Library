creations-chat 2021-12-15 23:01:50 Why do people downvote creations so much?
creations-chat 2021-12-15 23:07:21 Why u gotta hate me so much? Why you gotta be so toxic? It was my first submarine anyway, if your gonna talk trash, why don't you guide me on how to make it better?
creations-chat 2021-12-15 23:10:35 Well I mean, this server is just so damn toxic that they gotta bring down people trying to get better at the game.
creations-chat 2021-12-15 23:14:48 Or perhaps maybe you could offer to help me make the build better? Instead of shaming me?
creations-chat 2021-12-15 23:17:54 How about we all start over and never talk about this ever again? I feel like im about to be known and hated by the entire community and I don't want that. I just want to learn to get better at the game. I am down in the dumps today okay? Had a long ass day.
creations-chat 2021-12-17 14:09:41 FACT: 75% of people that downvote creations most likely do it in an act of jealousy. (Go ahead and criticize me for it, you and I both know it's true.)
creations-chat 2021-12-17 14:12:52 Heh, even you know it's true.
creations-chat 2021-12-17 14:15:50 Well considering tiktok has done many bad things to this world im going to have to agree on this one.
creations-chat 2021-12-17 14:19:20 still though, A lot of the downvoted creations I see are not that bad to me. Considering that some people dont know how to motorlock which is basically shaming them for it.

creations-chat 2021-12-18 23:14:06 Ok let's all be real here. Who actually uses stairs in creations? (Buildings don't count.)
creations-chat 2021-12-20 14:29:24 <@!521855442608193537>  The only problem with your suggestion is that you are basically rushing rickje to finish PC2. You have to give him some time to make it perfect. If he releases it too early, major bugs could occur, it is possible we could lose creations/data. which is why it's good to wait until the game is ready to play without it being unstable.
creations-chat 2021-12-20 14:31:32 He could do that, but like I said. There could be major bugs that may occur that could possibly wipe creations/data. Anything can happen. So it's good to let him finish up. The plane crazy we have is good as it is for now.
creations-chat 2021-12-20 14:35:26 I agree. It would make me much more hype for the release if he showed progress, but maybe he is staying silent for a reason. Maybe he doesnt want us to see what the game is really like yet

bug-reports 2022-11-12 00:22:18 Incorrect.
bug-reports 2022-11-12 00:22:33 Not even sound effects work.
bug-reports 2022-11-12 00:22:55 I tried to use a minigun sound effect which is on sale in the library and it doesn't play any more.
bug-reports 2022-11-12 00:24:08 BUG REPORT: Camera no longer looks through parts when deploying your vehicle
bug-reports 2022-11-12 00:24:32 This makes it impossible to view in third person if your plane or vehicle is enclosed without transparent parts
bug-reports 2022-11-12 00:25:17 I feel like the recent update broke a crap ton of stuff
bug-reports 2022-11-12 00:25:44 Maybe the update should just be reverted to the previous version so rickje can make some improvements
