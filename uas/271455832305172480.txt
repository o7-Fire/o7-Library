[PVP]
One may ask, "Why would you want to nerf cutter blocks?" And for my answer, 2 words: *Shredder bugs.*
To the 2 people in this server who don't know what shredder bugs are, they're creations that can fly incredibly fast and use cutter blocks to decimate creations in a matter of seconds. There's very few ways to counter these, hence why I'm trying to nerf cutter blocks, as they rely on them.
I have a few ways to nerf cutter blocks, listed below:
1. Add a block that cannot be destroyed by cutter blocks, but would still be vunerable to other weapons, that you can only place a few of in each creation.
2. Make cutter blocks have a limit to how many blocks they can destroy.
3. Make cutter blocks take some time to destroy a block, the same way guns can't instantly destroy blocks.>

bot-central 2021-01-29 01:05:19 &suggest An item search. This appear as a bar next to the materials button in the build tab, and it would search categories (as in like the "Half Blocks", "Helium Blocks" or "Wedges" categories). That's about it.
