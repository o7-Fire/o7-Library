The Tale of edzactly (162156549978980352)
creations-chat 2020-03-30 09:12:45 Half-Life: Alyx just came out a week ago and I decided to recreate the iconic Combine Gunship that you find in both HL:A and HL2.
creations-chat 2020-03-30 09:15:35 To be honest I could've made one main rotor but since idk how to make swashplates, I used two to stabilize and make it flyable lol
creations-chat 2020-04-01 06:41:35 Stryker ATGM and Stryker LAV. Both have separate controls. I move the Stryker ATGM with WASD (which is my main) and the LAV with TFGH. The Stryker ATGM can fire up to 9 missiles while the LAV uses guns for support.
creations-chat 2020-04-01 06:42:19 The Stryker LAV can also carry eight other people (and possibly another driver to control this one using the secondary pilot seat).

the-dump 2020-04-21 06:56:21 lel have you seen their recruitment posters?
the-dump 2020-04-21 06:56:28 literally using anime girls on the posters lmao
the-dump 2020-04-21 06:56:37 even got sponsored by an anime
the-dump 2020-04-21 06:56:53 anime is Gate
the-dump 2020-04-21 06:57:09 it won't be surprising if their military is composed of otakus
the-dump 2020-04-21 06:57:22 so much for self-defense force
the-dump 2020-04-21 06:58:37 speaking of self-defense, I remember there were talks of having an article in them that is being abolished or something. basically that article prevents Japan from going into wars, thus their *Self-Defense* force
the-dump 2020-04-21 06:58:45 people are debating over it though
the-dump 2020-04-21 07:01:40 smh there are still a lot of stuff that Japan didn't acknowledge
the-dump 2020-04-21 07:01:49 just like the shit that they did in my country back in WW2
the-dump 2020-04-21 07:03:10 Not sure if it's ok to talk about this here but some of them are war crimes that Japan did, such as the Bataan Death March
the-dump 2020-04-21 07:03:23 literally hundreds of PoW Americans and Filipinos were forced to march under the sun
the-dump 2020-04-21 07:03:26 bruh

creations-chat 2020-04-24 05:50:01 and it flies lol
help 2020-04-24 05:50:44 You'll need a lot more propellers or something to move it on water
creations-chat 2020-04-24 05:52:40 epic
help 2020-04-24 06:19:20 Yeah because the speedometer is showing the top speed of the engines or propellers on your build, but due to how water affects builds, it moves slow.
help 2020-04-24 06:20:21 Can you show a picture of your build?
help 2020-04-24 06:23:29 Hmm
help 2020-04-24 06:23:47 Yeah it moves slow because of friction from the build and the ground.
help 2020-04-24 06:24:04 What you could do is either put wheels on it or set the blocks at the bottom to ice material.
help 2020-04-24 06:24:26 Yeah but you said it also moves slow when not in water lol
help 2020-04-24 06:24:29 Oh I see.
help 2020-04-24 06:25:34 Oh when it's on the surface of the water
help 2020-04-24 06:28:36 I'm not really sure what to say about this, but comparing both builds doesn't matter since they're differently built. One thing I could say, the reason why the shark moves slow out of water is because of roblox physics.
help 2020-04-24 06:29:08 Or maybe I'm not really just the right person to ask about that <:GWchadMEGATHINK:366999806343774218>
help 2020-04-24 06:30:19 Yeah lag also affects the speed of your build
help 2020-04-24 06:30:34 Though if a big build moves with high speed, it tend to lag
help 2020-04-24 06:32:08 ?
help 2020-04-24 06:33:15 Either add a lot of rocket engines or add a conveyer engine
help 2020-04-24 06:33:29 My 1706 block A-10 uses 48 super rocket engines to fly lol
help 2020-04-24 06:33:51 You'll need a lot of power to move bigger builds
help 2020-04-24 06:34:15 How many rockets does it have
help 2020-04-24 06:35:06 super rocket engines?
help 2020-04-24 06:35:28 Wait so it moves slow but it can still fly?
help 2020-04-24 06:36:08 Because to be honest, if you wanna fly faster, you can straight up use a conveyer drive
help 2020-04-24 06:36:19 Conveyer drives moves really fast
help 2020-04-24 06:36:42 bruh
help 2020-04-24 06:46:54 I don't exactly remember how to build one though but it comprises of two conveyer blocks and a piston
help 2020-04-24 06:47:08 Also it shouldn't interrupt it
help 2020-04-24 06:47:29 There's tutorials on how to build one
help 2020-04-24 06:47:34 It's a relatively small module
help 2020-04-24 06:50:11 Not really, as long as you keep the speed of the conveyers slower, because speed of 5 alone is already fast.

help 2020-05-15 08:57:05 <@!290002582276014082> I can't really provide an example right now, but what you can do is motor lock a bunch of blocks with one disconnector each and when a rocket is near you, activate the disconnectors.
bug-reports 2020-05-15 14:26:08 Odd. I use a conveyer drive (1 conveyer + friction block) to accelerate my aircraft. It used to be able to do perfect barrel rolls without tilting to the sides. It also used to not wobble unless I use rockets instead of the drive. Conveyer speed is 22, and I can hit a stable max speed of 800-1000.

Now, I put it on speed of 5, it accelerates slowly, but then it gradually increases up to 2k and I lose control of the aircraft build :c

bug-reports 2020-05-16 02:51:39 <@!217336009455566848> This may or may not be of interest to you regarding the conveyer drives. I did some testing again today this morning and I found out the reason why my aircraft is so janky when using a conveyer drive.

Turns out that small landing gears are the root cause of this. Here's a video clip of the aircraft **without** the small landing gear doing a full barrel roll. Conveyer speed is at 22 and I press E to roll the aircraft.
bug-reports 2020-05-16 02:52:23 And here's a clip of the aircraft **with** the small landing gear. Again, same conveyer speed at 22, same keybind. All I do here is roll but the plane seem to fly in another direction even though I'm just rolling.
bug-reports 2020-05-16 02:53:19 I'm not holding other directional keys on the second video, only my right-roll key "E"
bug-reports 2020-05-16 02:58:00 Conclusion, small landing gears literally makes the aircraft build uncontrollable and unstable. That's why the plane keeps spazzing out when doing turns last night on your server :l

creations-chat 2020-05-22 10:58:37 You can use TNT if you have enough.
creations-chat 2020-05-22 10:59:33 Basically what it does is that the motor locks pull the treads into the wheels. Once it is fitted, you activate the BreakWeld on the springs (or det the TNT) so it unwelds from the treads.
