help 2021-01-05 12:34:19 the automatic control surfaces on the rudders ig you would call them arent gonna help too much for steering imo
help 2021-01-05 12:34:38 so you could replace those with plain wings and try with only 2 control wings
help 2021-01-05 12:35:58 though i dont have experience with rockets, try using manual controls
help 2021-01-05 12:36:21 or make bigger control surfaces using motor2
help 2021-01-05 12:36:38 those solved a big problem on my largest plane
help 2021-01-05 12:40:20 technically if u use motors 2 on each wing you should have full control
help 2021-01-05 12:40:42 also use control surfaces as smaller wing panels
creations-chat 2021-01-05 12:41:12 guys i got a quick question whats a motor lock?

creations-chat 2021-01-05 12:46:41 aaah ok ty
help 2021-01-05 12:47:14 no i mean how can i fit even more plane in the plot

help 2021-01-05 12:48:08 you gotta hold the buttons pressed cuz the power increases incrementally
help 2021-01-05 12:48:19 its not toggle
help 2021-01-05 12:48:26 oof kay
help 2021-01-05 12:49:13 would engine lock be useful for making a longer plane?
help 2021-01-05 12:49:29 i never used that mechanic before so idk what i can do with it
help 2021-01-05 12:50:08 lmao dude dont make the whole wing a control surface
help 2021-01-05 12:50:14 ok ty

help 2021-01-05 12:50:41 make only a 1*2 per wing or something
help 2021-01-05 12:50:59 and limit the angle to something smaller like 15

creations-chat 2021-01-05 12:51:35 ty
help 2021-01-05 13:01:57 xd
help 2021-01-05 13:39:37 guys anyone got a design for a plane hatch
help 2021-01-05 13:39:49 the kind that lowers as a stepway?
help 2021-01-05 15:30:01 dont think so
help 2021-01-05 15:30:20 i have seen flying boxes before
help 2021-01-05 16:43:30 lmao how bad can it be
help 2021-01-06 09:58:07 ranks..?
help 2021-01-31 20:04:48 you got no rear rotor your heli is spinning out of control without it
help 2021-01-31 20:05:28 or add a second rotor on top of main one spinning the opposite way
help 2021-01-31 20:05:44 yeah but they also keep you from spinning the way the main blades are spinning
help 2021-01-31 20:06:21 the double rotor could work i saw some people pull it off
help 2021-01-31 20:06:57 idk honestly, im still struggling to build helis but you're surely missing something to keep you from spinning out of control
