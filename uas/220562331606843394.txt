help 2018-11-09 20:32:40 That’s complicated
help 2018-11-09 20:32:48 I’ve tried to do that and I’m still not done
help 2018-11-09 20:33:13 You need to use the swashplate mechanism if you’re only using one top rotor instead of two I believe
help 2018-11-09 20:33:19 plane?
help 2018-11-09 20:34:50 https://i.gyazo.com/f2eb3b32abcbf5d2b6c631a50e271ea7.mp4
Here’s the mechanism I use to move it forward back left and right
help 2018-11-09 20:35:49 The problem is that the rotor has too much torque and it makes the body spin in the other direction
help 2018-11-09 20:36:29 and using the tail rotor to counteract it makes it unbalanced
help 2018-11-09 20:39:52 See if you can use any ideas from this https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=884569010

creations-chat 2018-11-11 03:52:03 ignore the weird suspension snug at the end
creations-chat 2018-11-11 03:52:05 I fixed that
creations-chat 2018-11-11 03:52:09 *I hope*
creations-chat 2018-11-11 04:10:37 I won’t until I get it balanced correctly. It’s embarrassingly bad right now.
creations-chat 2018-11-11 04:13:01 it can go forward back left and right but it won’t stay upright unless I continually counter the tilting until it falls over
creations-chat 2018-11-11 04:15:15 it has to do the torque created by the main rotor which rotates the body the opposite direction
creations-chat 2018-11-11 04:15:31 And using the tail rotor to counter it
creations-chat 2018-11-11 04:15:41 messed up the balance
creations-chat 2018-11-11 04:20:50 It’s controllable
creations-chat 2018-11-11 04:20:57 it’s not that much of a spin
creations-chat 2018-11-11 04:21:18 when I get home
creations-chat 2018-11-11 04:21:57 If I make a Chinook I won’t have this problem
creations-chat 2018-11-11 04:22:26 Since the blades spin in opposite directions
creations-chat 2018-11-11 04:23:54 dual main rotors

creations-chat 2018-11-12 22:49:44 because it does not start spinning
creations-chat 2018-11-12 22:58:43 top to bottom as in front to back?
creations-chat 2018-11-12 22:59:25 I haven't added the rear pair of nacelles yet
creations-chat 2018-11-12 23:00:18 but its not gonna spin
creations-chat 2018-11-12 23:01:00 I know how to properly use rotors. How to make it move in all directions and turn only using the motors and rotors in the nacelles
creations-chat 2018-11-12 23:01:26 to make it turn left you speed up the front left and back right
creations-chat 2018-11-12 23:01:29 for example
creations-chat 2018-11-12 23:01:39 *let me double check*
creations-chat 2018-11-13 21:36:00 *reee you cheated and used thrusters to spin the rotors*
creations-chat 2018-11-13 21:38:22 I hope you at least used the rotors for Pitch and Yaw
creations-chat 2018-11-13 21:39:11 Good
creations-chat 2018-11-13 21:39:55 I hate when people make VTOLs and have it basically all thrusters and the rotors are basically for decoration
creations-chat 2018-11-13 22:05:29 <@!264769733021270016> I agree
creations-chat 2018-11-13 22:10:16 why do you keep capitalizing every d a m n word
creations-chat 2018-11-13 22:10:22 r e e e e
creations-chat 2018-11-13 22:12:36 Do helicarriers count as VTOLs
creations-chat 2018-11-13 22:14:23 so they do
creations-chat 2018-11-13 22:15:47 Wasn’t there a competition for VTVL rockets?
creations-chat 2018-11-14 04:21:22 I got the top deck flush except for those holes the piston takes up I might figure out a way to fix it later
creations-chat 2018-11-14 04:22:49 heres it while in build mode
creations-chat 2018-11-14 04:28:59 oml is your plane like 4 times longer than the wings are in width?
creations-chat 2018-11-14 04:29:12 w h y
creations-chat 2018-11-14 04:29:19 oof
creations-chat 2018-11-14 04:30:04 two point folds are better than three point folds to be honnest
creations-chat 2018-11-14 04:30:20 it allows for more width to work with the wings
creations-chat 2018-11-14 15:36:46 Too bad I can’t show a short video of my helicarrier folding together because it takes a long time to get the nacelles in their slot as I have to kinda rest it on the gap and it slowly slides in
creations-chat 2018-11-14 18:01:04 <@456226577798135808> what did you replicate? It’s a completely out of proportion ship.
bug-reports 2018-11-14 18:02:33 <@456226577798135808> you gotta be smart with how you do the folding. So if the wings are up and you fold em down they would fall into a slot which prevents them from moving and stuff
creations-chat 2018-11-14 18:04:07 but what ship did you *try* to replicate

creations-chat 2018-11-22 07:33:20 if only ball bearing joits were added
creations-chat 2018-11-22 07:37:42 whats the mechanism that you did to get it working
creations-chat 2018-11-22 07:38:07 wait nvm
creations-chat 2018-11-22 07:39:18 I looked back at your posts before
creations-chat 2018-11-22 07:39:38 so you used ropes?
creations-chat 2018-11-22 07:39:50 strange
creations-chat 2018-11-22 07:41:19 I was trying to build the swashplate like how its done in besiege as I've made a few helicopters but it cant translate into this game because we are missing hinges and ball joints
creations-chat 2018-11-22 07:43:19 the problem is that to get the same function of a hinge that bends instead of turns is that withought hinges you need to use three blocks to get the same effect

creations-chat 2018-11-22 07:45:45 how did you manage to properly cancel out the torque?
creations-chat 2018-11-22 07:46:29 since the way its built in this game means the actual main rotor is creating way more torque becuase of how big the swashplate is
creations-chat 2018-11-22 07:46:50 ah lol
creations-chat 2018-11-22 07:46:56 that tail blade lol
