creations-chat 2020-09-24 04:51:24 Hey Can you guys tell me what I did wrong with my F-35? I got a lot of downvotes
creations-chat 2020-09-24 04:51:37 Is it the paintjob?
creations-chat 2020-09-24 04:52:14 good to know
creations-chat 2020-09-24 04:52:16 thanks
creations-chat 2020-09-30 23:27:46 I swear every time I look in this chat there is always a picture of a tank barrel pointed at the camera
creations-chat 2020-09-30 23:28:25 And I envy them because I can't build tanks
creations-chat 2020-09-30 23:29:24 I just cant. Its weird. I can build air vehicles fine, but tanks for some stupid reason just never turn out the way I want then too
creations-chat 2020-09-30 23:29:45 oof
creations-chat 2020-10-03 04:22:54 right
creations-chat 2020-10-03 04:24:50 What did I do wrong with my hi-24? Everyone hates it. Can someone tell me?
creations-chat 2020-10-03 04:25:51 Then why do I have 6 downvotes and no upvotes?

creations-chat 2020-10-04 17:53:16 bruh stririf you didn't even look at the video before downvoting it. Jeez
creations-chat 2020-10-04 17:54:58 you were first
creations-chat 2020-10-04 17:55:41 and you posted your downvote not even 2 seconds after the video loaded. And true, it is stubby.

creations-chat 2020-10-10 18:18:47 So I joined a lobby, right? after about 5 minuets, some guy starts BUILDING in MY plot. Its my plot, its says my name, but he is building in it. I can build on his build, and he can build on mine. I'm so confused
bug-reports 2020-10-10 18:21:23 This guy started building in my plot. I could build on his build, and he could build on my build. When I launched my build, his build stayed.
creations-chat 2020-10-20 04:29:49 Sometimes, I don't understand this discord. I made a f/18c, And got a like to dislike ratio of 2. And this guy made a crappyish f-4 and gets a ratio of 5.25
creations-chat 2020-10-20 04:32:01 This is the f-18 that got 24 upvotes and 12 downvotes. I get that Its hard to make a f-4 that small, and it looks fine, but I don't think this f-18 deserves more downvotes than the f-4
creations-chat 2020-10-20 04:33:10 And you don't think that the f-4 has room to improve?https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/384025409945337856/767941227437621288/RobloxScreenShot20201015_125819524_2.png
creations-chat 2020-10-20 04:36:14 Still, this f-4 has over twice as many upvotes and half as many downvotes as my f-18
creations-chat 2020-10-20 04:38:44 Ok, what about my b-26? it has 20 upvotes and 6 downvotes
creations-chat 2020-10-20 04:42:09 I'm not saying that the f-4 doesn't deserve those 48 upvotes, its just I'm jealous that I can't do the same with builds. Its just disappointing
creations-chat 2020-10-20 04:46:32 Half wedge(the one in normal wedges), then half wedge in half wedges motor locked into a half wedge 1x2

creations-chat 2020-10-20 04:56:13 I hope your ocean is also 1/2566th scale
creations-chat 2020-10-20 04:57:19 No, it was an educated guess
creations-chat 2020-10-20 04:59:19 Technicaly, if your boat there is 5 feet long, then your boats are more like 1/256th scale(Assuming the carrier is based after the USS enterprise)
creations-chat 2020-10-23 02:42:37 How should I paint my snake? I just made it, and I have no Idea what color to paint it

help 2020-11-23 22:48:18 Hey, I noticed that my helicopters no longer worked. They now don't take off, and I think it has something to do with today's update. I also noticed that my elevators and alerions on my fighter jets are kinda buggy too. Any ideas what's going on?

creations-chat 2020-12-07 04:57:19 Just finished an AC-130, but I don't want to post it yet. It's kinda late and I won't get that many upvotes. I am posting it here to see what I might get though, kinda like a forcast
creations-chat 2020-12-09 20:44:53 You guys think I got a shot at the contest?
creations-chat 2020-12-09 20:52:51 I got 5th once with a coast guard heli, lost to a guy with another coast guard heli. Maybe it will happen again, But this I'm even more confident about.

creations-chat 2020-12-19 17:26:43 I might motorlock a panel in that place to get a smooth line, my motor tower is right there
help 2021-01-06 18:48:25 I build a large b-17. It looks good, but flies way too slow to be useful in a pvp setting. I have tried motor locking super rockets into the engines and a conveyor engine. In case you are wondering, the bomb bay uses disconectors, not the laggy ball bombs, and blocks count is almost 3000. I believe the issue is coming from the large size, or something of that matter. Any tips would be appreciated.
