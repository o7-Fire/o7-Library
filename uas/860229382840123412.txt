bug-reports 2022-04-30 16:53:26 I havnt taken any screenshots yet, but when I damage someone's creation sometimes it freezes in place while only a couple blocks are still moving. Damaging the frozen creation doesn't do anything...

creations-chat 2022-05-01 17:58:18 For detail what should I add? I'm stumped. And what colors do you suggest? I'll try to smooth the angles out a bit.

creations-chat 2022-05-22 21:56:15 How do I make a good build.
