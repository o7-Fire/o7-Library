creations-chat 2023-07-18 13:15:59 I would say 5 to 7 blocks wide, depends on which version you build. Is it the truck based one or that on  tracked GM-352 chassis?

help 2023-07-18 15:36:12 How does the scoring system for creations work? Is score of twenty like 28 upvotes and 8 downvotes?
help 2023-07-18 15:45:42 I get that but how is the score counted? Is it just the number of upvotes or number of upvotes minus number of downvotes?
