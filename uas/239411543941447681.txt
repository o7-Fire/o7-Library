creations-chat 2022-12-14 10:13:21 Testing with a scale made using a free-floating motor and a long symmetrical beam, the block with the disconnector plates seems to be heavier than the plateless block. I believe this may have something to do with how magnets themselves affect different blocks instead, since it's not always entirely consistent.
creations-chat 2022-12-14 10:38:21 Magnets do be funky
Among other things, they can be used for ECMs that can deflect tracking rockets fairly reliably, at least when moving at decent speed
help 2022-12-14 10:43:00 Yeah, in the tab with the gears, you'll find it by scrolling down a little
help 2022-12-14 10:45:19 Here.
creations-chat 2022-12-14 10:47:18 Well there's a certain type of magnet drive that will amplify magnet range and I believe strength too(unsure about that one), and for some reason once that has been activated once it can affect rockets even when the magnet isn't enabled in any direction

Hard to explain exactly, and on top of that I don't really want to end up leaking tech that could maybe cause chaos in the wrong hands

And no, it doesn't involve disconnectors
help 2022-12-14 10:48:52 No problem man, happy building ðŸ‘‹
creations-chat 2022-12-14 10:54:38 Oh yikes, the physics lag lol
Uhh dunno what part of that involves said tech? What am I looking for in here-
Also I would post footage of the ECM tech in action, however I, a pesky whitename, do not have embed access outside of just a few channels. I can post the media link here in a bit maybe, but it won't be embedded
O wait what must've missed it since it looked uneventful so I was skipping through it. Where exactly in the video is that?
creations-chat 2022-12-14 10:58:49 Woah that's interesting
Oh yeah, here, if you want to see the ecm thing in action https://streamable.com/yl2kdi
Ofc it only works against tracking rockets, but it's pretty neat and useful nonetheless
creations-chat 2022-12-14 11:01:53 Nice nice
Well, good luck lol
help 2022-12-14 12:40:10 Try increasing the dampening slider
if that doesn't work, you can try to put hover thrusters with drag in the thing. If you do that just make sure to lower their throttle to zero during setup

creations-chat 2022-12-14 13:23:23 The duck cutter did it
creations-chat 2022-12-14 13:25:51 Huh lol

creations-chat 2022-12-21 14:07:08 Very precise angle locking, is my guess
creations-chat 2023-03-28 06:31:12 Hull looks fairly pro imo, turret feels a bit bulky but that might just be me
creations-chat 2023-03-28 06:37:33 Eh understandable. Maybe later ig
creations-chat 2023-03-28 06:46:27 Yeah that too, detailing is lacking for sure.
help 2023-03-29 06:33:27 Just chat enough to get to level 3
help 2023-03-29 06:34:54 Like a week at most if you're active, if you're decently active it won't take long at all really.
