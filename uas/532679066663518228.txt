help 2021-12-20 21:24:50 huh
help 2021-12-20 21:44:26 Ok I think I found the issue it’s that you can’t motor lock them but I wonder if you used tnt it would be possible without a negative effect
help 2021-12-20 21:47:17 Probably because motors aren’t really real blocks
help 2021-12-20 21:47:51 And thus not “connected” to the aircraft and not accounting for its speed
