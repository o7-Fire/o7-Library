creations-chat 2021-02-04 22:51:34 is there anything i could improve here?
creations-chat 2021-02-04 22:53:55 i wish
creations-chat 2021-02-04 22:56:34 just a custom plane of my own design, aside from motorlocking ofc
creations-chat 2021-02-04 22:59:03 the fuselage is kinda wonky to fit in the ejection system and as for the paint, im really just not good at coloring stuff
creations-chat 2021-02-04 23:10:00 yeah definitely not a viper

creations-chat 2021-02-17 18:15:12 this cooldown is killing me

<@!287454032250011649> the barrel is thick so i can conceal the 10 pvp guns lined up back to back
<@!449956273127948290> ill probably build a version of this with no rockets
<@!569298230983131137> sure give me a sec
creations-chat 2021-02-17 18:18:12 wouldnt it look worse to have exposed guns? i could try motorlocking all of the guns into one space and having the locked motors act as the rest of the vulcan barrel maybe?
creations-chat 2021-02-17 18:26:14 oh i get what youre saying now
