creations-chat 2022-09-07 17:53:13 I prefer 2 because imo colours that a duller and darker with military vehicles/aircraft looks pretty nicer to look at (there's exceptions but this one's good enough)
creations-chat 2022-09-07 17:55:14 maybe make the paint have gradiant so it will blend well and try hiding the gaps if possible
creations-chat 2022-09-07 17:58:40 The darker one, add a little bit of blueish tone to it 
Example: 126, 125, 126. Reason why red is also there because to make it more cyan (or yellow i honestly forgot how to do colour codes) but experiment the colours till you get the right one
