creations-chat 2022-03-10 00:19:06 <@!765318482753224704>  I figured out how to make the front of kitt
creations-chat 2022-04-03 18:15:22 does anyone have suggestions to make white wall tires for my delorean?
creations-chat 2022-04-03 18:17:44 <@!792863390392385556>buster123 THE delorean
creations-chat 2022-04-03 18:19:51 i tried to make it to scale
creations-chat 2022-04-11 01:13:40 i put the guns to weaponize it like in the movie, and put legacy glass so you can see the blue quill in the cockpit
creations-chat 2022-04-11 01:16:06 well, yes. not exactly proud of that.
creations-chat 2022-04-11 01:17:48 im not very good at camera and motor locking
creations-chat 2022-04-11 01:20:37 well, i met a guy named DestructiveLogic, and he inspred me to upgrade my DeLorean and start basic motorlocking, even tho he is on a higher skill level than i am
creations-chat 2022-05-01 15:09:46 yea, i know
creations-chat 2022-05-01 15:11:33 i recolored it to a picture i saw of a crossover between the ecto-1 and delorean time machine. i have both cars separate, but all my builds get downvoted for some reason
creations-chat 2022-05-01 15:17:33 that looks so good! heres a picture of mine
creations-chat 2022-05-01 15:30:17 i also built ecto-1 from ghostbusters afterlife, and ecto-1a from ghostbusters 2
creations-chat 2022-05-02 21:14:10 ok you didnt have to say that. i do the best i can because im not very good with motor lock
creations-chat 2022-05-02 21:16:10 i'd like to see you try. scale, function, and shape. it was a sh*t show making the DeLorean
creations-chat 2022-05-02 21:17:51 i've only been playing for 2 years
creations-chat 2022-05-02 21:19:35 well i dont really experiment with motor or camera lock and i keep things basic, but good so i dont have 14 mental breakdowns in one build
creations-chat 2022-05-02 21:21:30 why are you guys being so mean? i came here to share my builds, get feedback and get positive build reviews
creations-chat 2022-05-02 21:23:27 this build uses both motor locking and camera locking
creations-chat 2022-05-02 21:25:23 i use exposed motor lock as detail
creations-chat 2022-05-02 21:27:04 no
creations-chat 2022-05-04 20:36:27 ya know what? i m gonna revisit an old build and make a better one.
creations-chat 2022-05-04 20:38:15 i'm gonna remake tordbot from Eddsworld
creations-chat 2022-05-04 21:03:47 <@690017479006748791>  sure, i have a DeLorean time machine tutorial if you wanna build that. Warning: takes 2 hours to build
creations-chat 2022-05-04 21:05:29 yeah, the video is an hour long and it takes longer cuz u have to pause and build frequently
creations-chat 2022-05-04 21:07:36 well, what can i say execpt you need time and patience to build it. i just record and upload after nonstop building
creations-chat 2022-05-05 22:03:37 thats not a good thing
creations-chat 2022-05-05 23:33:02 old tordbot vs progress on the new one (old on the left, new on the right)
creations-chat 2022-05-05 23:35:03 also yes, there is a full interior for the cockpit
creations-chat 2022-05-08 16:41:29 yea
creations-chat 2022-05-08 16:43:49 technically its not a repost its just another screenshot
creations-chat 2022-05-08 16:45:43 eh i dont care too much. haters gonna hate and i dont have the time or patience to care
creations-chat 2022-05-08 16:47:25 that looks really good
creations-chat 2022-05-08 17:05:06 still, i dont care
creations-chat 2022-05-08 17:07:44 yeah, so? thats just what i do. my builds may be simple, but thats just how i do it
creations-chat 2022-05-08 17:10:31 eh i figure stuff out as i go on. i met destructivelogic in a server on accident and taught myself simple motorlocking after seeing his complex delroean so i tried to take it simple and maybe in some time from noe, i'll be a better builder

creations-chat 2022-07-08 01:08:13 <@836207315937656872>  thats a sick car!
creations-chat 2022-07-08 01:12:08 np
creations-chat 2022-07-24 22:05:30 no, its Team Fortress 2
creations-chat 2022-07-25 18:17:49 no, thats my delorean. i have a youtube channel, and I make tutorials.
creations-chat 2022-08-09 21:18:11 maybe you have. either in-game, or on my youtube channel
creations-chat 2022-08-21 19:11:02 well jeez, sorry that its my first build
creations-chat 2022-08-21 19:13:11 well not my first build but my first plane
I build cars
creations-chat 2022-08-21 19:15:13 i did
- DeLorean Time Machine
- ECTO-1
- K.I.T.T
- Cadillac
- Chevy C8 Corvette
- General Lee
- McLaren MCL36
creations-chat 2022-08-21 19:17:19 i know, but i already posted them as i built them throughout the year
creations-chat 2022-08-21 19:19:22 lemme think about it.

creations-chat 2022-08-21 19:45:04 I wanna hit a support cable with a wrench
thats how they did the star wars blaster sound, and I wanna hear it for myself
creations-chat 2022-08-24 00:23:59 does this look ok for the front of a 1957 Plymouth?
creations-chat 2022-08-24 00:26:01 alright, thanks
creations-chat 2022-08-24 00:28:21 that looks so good, it almost looks fake, good job! :D
creations-chat 2022-10-18 21:25:30 ill see what i can do. the flux bands were hard to pull off, or else it will disturb the roof and roofrack motorlocking.
creations-chat 2022-12-10 01:47:26 imagine not knowing that it's my tutorial that i modified
creations-chat 2022-12-10 01:49:32 i have my yt linked to my discord
creations-chat 2022-12-10 01:53:15 ok idk what happened but i had my yt linked to my discord
creations-chat 2022-12-10 01:56:01 yeah, I just checked, and it's linked. right click my profile and it's there on the bottom
creations-chat 2023-01-13 23:10:31 i don't repost. I update my builds and post a picture of the update with an update log included.
creations-chat 2023-02-03 01:53:30 <@813185366017310821>  I already had a 1959 Cadillac so I figured "Why not?" so I made it. I got lazy and didn't really think about it, so I didn't add all the dirt on the car. The engine was tricky to pull off because i couldn't find any good pictures, and the wheels and secondary Cadillac were definitely a challenge.
creations-chat 2023-02-08 21:18:51 this is true. I have the lego set on my desk, and I figured it would be easy to base off of. The interior is also based off of the set. Good eye for pointing it out tho, 'cause I was gonna reveal that when the interior was done.
creations-chat 2023-03-19 18:34:02 here's my Ferrari F40. any suggestions?
creations-chat 2023-03-19 18:43:08 it was hell to make
creations-chat 2023-03-19 18:45:11 plus on a 7-wide scale, limited wedge variety, and not the best at motor locking, make this harder to do
the-dump 2023-03-21 20:31:13 
creations-chat 2023-03-25 01:14:35 idk i think the bot died or smthn
creations-chat 2023-04-15 18:34:24 you're thinking of the wrong car. idk what this is, but I built a Ferrari F40, which is why the license plate literally says 'RARI-F40'
creations-chat 2023-04-15 18:40:15 average <:trollface:775024642104229898> activity
creations-chat 2023-04-16 17:19:01 motorlocking is a fascinating thing. If it's as little as 1 wedge angle off, it can mess up the whole thing and it won't work
creations-chat 2023-04-16 17:21:46 yeah. making these upgrades to the delorean was a challange, but  figured it out and everything works and looks good
creations-chat 2023-04-16 17:23:52 and making my Ferrari F40 was also quite a challenge but I got it done
creations-chat 2023-04-16 17:26:03 i try to conquer both in a build
creations-chat 2023-04-29 01:52:00 yeah, my tutorial. It was the first delorean I posted on the channel
creations-chat 2023-04-29 01:56:42 the new delorean shown in the picture is soon to be a tutorial, uploaded as mk4
the-dump 2023-05-25 21:14:46 blueprint posters for my delorean time machine and ecto-1
