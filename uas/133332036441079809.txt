creations-chat 2020-05-19 18:06:45 whats your definition of a swashplate?
creations-chat 2020-05-19 18:07:19 explain
creations-chat 2020-05-19 18:08:01 I thought a swashplate is something that encodes the blades as it processes around the aircraft.

creations-chat 2020-05-19 18:16:10 The challenge was not to make a "good" helicopter. If it can hover, go from point to point, and land, its good enough for me.
creations-chat 2020-05-19 18:18:18 pretty neat
creations-chat 2020-05-19 18:19:08 Dont know why they would do that.
creations-chat 2020-05-19 18:21:08 the main rotor is tilted to the side to cancel out the thrust from the tail cancelling torque. But in PC, because of the size of the entire swashplate assembly, its hard to tilt it inside of an airframe.
creations-chat 2020-05-19 18:23:05 Lol I saw it. Maybe pixel art overlapping text?

creations-chat 2020-09-07 05:11:41 define
creations-chat 2020-09-07 05:11:48 does that mean there were vibrations?
creations-chat 2020-09-07 05:12:04 or angular momentumn conservation thing?
creations-chat 2020-09-07 05:12:29 wdym rough?
creations-chat 2020-09-07 05:12:41 I am just curious. I have not seen blades with "dampening" before
creations-chat 2020-09-07 05:14:17 hmm
creations-chat 2020-09-07 05:15:15 Usually when I have blades hit the limit, I try to increase rotation rate or make the blades more massive for a larger correcting force. I will try out some suspension though.
creations-chat 2020-09-07 05:15:24 thanks for the idea
creations-chat 2020-09-07 05:15:54 Still,
creations-chat 2020-09-07 05:16:09 wouldnt just increasing the motor 2 hinge angles reduce the vibration problem
creations-chat 2020-09-07 05:16:15 sure it would have more flapping angle
creations-chat 2020-09-07 05:16:26 but it could save some space
creations-chat 2020-09-07 05:17:50 Technically with that design, I dont think you need a lag hinge
creations-chat 2020-09-07 05:18:28 because the heavy blades can just wiggle about the suspension,
creations-chat 2020-09-07 05:41:57 looks nice

help 2020-09-11 22:27:15 <@!586086848833519617>        maybe your heli does that cause there is a weird motor angle thing going on. Using vertical double motors on the lower swashplate made my heli have weird vibration issues and wildly flung the rotor in the AD, but it only had 1 double motor thing on the lower swash. Maybe you can just put rope? Probably smaller .

creations-chat 2021-08-16 19:36:56 Extremely accurate details and approximation on form, so great job. However, with roblox crude blocks, the effect is kind of clunky . It is definitely awesome and I prefer clunky, but others prefer less accurate just smooth stuff that is less perfect. Still, great job. Making an entire heli in this style is a way different take and I really like how it’s going so far so good luck. I’m actually making a MI26 halo right now too for the past months but a smaller scale with an 8 blade swashplate. Godspeed. Totally didn’t think this type of cockpit was possible
bot-central 2021-08-16 22:35:07 !servers
creations-chat 2021-08-17 16:57:20 Ayo you can do this with TNT balls. Literally the exact same thing but with 2 breech blocks. Very neatly made though. Made a BMP3 and armata loader using T-90 type loading. However, the bmp didn’t use an elevator. I guess the bmp3 is more t-80 styled though I really like how yours is so accurate though and the carousel labels are genius.
help 2021-08-19 00:24:25 Ayo not a help but a thank you. In the past year, the game seems to be working a lot better with motor interactions and ropes. My swashplates from 5 months ago don’t work anymore, but the new ones are so lag free even faster. Extremely bussin game

creations-chat 2021-09-15 05:00:32 just my opinion. A great tank, but if there was 1 glaring detail I would change it wouldnt be the tracks, the paint, the contours, but the barrel

bug-reports 2022-03-05 19:03:59 When they are spun, its as if they have more centrifugal force. This may because they are heavier, or because they have drag
