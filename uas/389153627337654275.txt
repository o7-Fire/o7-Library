plane-crazy 2020-05-17 01:39:02 I just created an origami abomination of a plane
plane-crazy 2020-04-06 18:39:43 I found it on my VIP server
plane-crazy 2020-04-06 18:39:35 idk
plane-crazy 2020-04-06 18:39:19 I hope you have a semi working plane
plane-crazy 2020-04-06 18:39:05 It's on the map
plane-crazy 2020-04-06 18:38:56 that completely removes the idea of it being an egghunt
plane-crazy 2020-04-06 18:38:46 I'll never give the exact location
plane-crazy 2020-04-06 18:38:02 exact opposite of where it is
plane-crazy 2020-04-06 18:37:57 not even close
plane-crazy 2020-04-06 18:35:34 Removes the fun
plane-crazy 2020-04-06 18:35:28 Why would I tell you
plane-crazy 2020-04-06 18:35:21 not telling any of you
plane-crazy 2020-04-06 18:35:16 super obvious
plane-crazy 2020-04-06 18:35:10 easiest find ever
plane-crazy 2020-04-06 18:35:03 seriously
plane-crazy 2020-04-06 18:34:52 Already found it
plane-crazy 2020-04-06 18:34:42 man imagine not being ranked
plane-crazy 2020-04-04 22:23:07 like that
plane-crazy 2020-04-04 22:23:05 yeah
plane-crazy 2020-04-04 22:23:03 oh
plane-crazy 2020-04-04 22:23:00 Could just make a mini version
plane-crazy 2020-03-31 19:19:39 It takes either a lot of helium, or a lot of magnets
plane-crazy 2020-03-31 19:18:13 in the end it basically sent my vehicle into the quantum realm
plane-crazy 2020-03-31 19:17:45 I wanted to see how many magnets it would take to break one of my creations
plane-crazy 2020-03-31 19:17:11 mine was a glitch
plane-crazy 2020-03-31 19:17:08 same
plane-crazy 2020-03-31 19:17:03 My highest broke the game
plane-crazy 2020-03-31 19:16:40 my current speed is 34k
plane-crazy 2020-03-31 19:13:58 on what
plane-crazy 2020-03-31 19:13:09 Could what I'm doing to my ship be considered torture
plane-crazy 2020-03-26 19:09:45 I just put the video in <#504436696021204992>
plane-crazy 2020-03-26 19:03:08 is there anything I can use to post a video of the ship moving
plane-crazy 2020-03-26 18:58:50 it has working oars as its main form of propulsion
plane-crazy 2020-03-26 18:58:37 Just made a longship
plane-crazy 2019-12-31 23:35:10 I think I got all of them but I just need to make sure
plane-crazy 2019-12-31 23:34:53 what are the event items
plane-crazy 2019-11-28 17:11:56 It works pretty well
plane-crazy 2019-11-28 17:11:52 I use a rudder type thing
plane-crazy 2019-10-20 23:11:00 work for it then
plane-crazy 2019-10-20 22:57:55 well that escalated quickly
plane-crazy 2019-10-20 22:48:31 alright let me see if I can find it
plane-crazy 2019-10-20 22:48:06 ok
plane-crazy 2019-10-20 22:47:55 Can I dm you the game that gave me the idea?
plane-crazy 2019-10-20 22:47:27 yeah
plane-crazy 2019-10-20 22:47:21 water
plane-crazy 2019-10-20 22:46:43 To be completely honest I don't think it would need to move at all
plane-crazy 2019-10-20 22:45:30 Do you guys agree with my suggestion?
plane-crazy 2019-10-12 22:26:00 F
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 23:36:09 is this plane crazy's 5th birthday?
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 23:35:58 so uh
