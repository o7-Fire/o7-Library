The Tale of agentux2 (435116494226063360)
help 2022-12-21 19:53:41 I'm trying to follow Namnam's guide for the airframe, but I'm a skill issue and cannot figure out how to make an F18 from this nose+canopy. The main issue I'm having is placing the wings so they go kinda in front of the cockpit, but that prevents me from covering with the trapdoors.
help 2022-12-21 20:24:29 Same with namnam. Some people just copy their builds block for block.
help 2022-12-21 20:33:26 Tbh, I really just want to make an aircraft that can fly, doesn't turn like a brick(so it can stand a chance in pvp), and is compact. I just want to blow crap up in an F18 made for pvp, that I didn't copy block for block
