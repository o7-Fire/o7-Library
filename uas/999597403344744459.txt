creations-chat 2022-09-12 06:03:43 my tie fighter might not look the best but it works beautifully in pvp
creations-chat 2022-09-12 06:16:48 it goes a little over 500 sps, 6 rockets deal damage, its very maneuverable because of the rocket stabilizers. small profile makes it hard to hit.
creations-chat 2022-09-12 06:19:16 the rocket stabilizers allow it to turn midair without needing to accelerate
