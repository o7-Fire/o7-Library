creations-chat 2022-02-04 17:06:02 less longer more fatter tanks
creations-chat 2022-02-04 18:38:43 almost got me until i checked the link
bug-reports 2022-04-02 14:40:00 Three Kind of bugs i found
bug-reports 2022-04-02 14:41:49 The overlapping (massless: [Fast]) gui is something ive never seen before
bug-reports 2022-04-02 15:29:48 is this a sercret?
bug-reports 2022-04-02 15:30:28 Plane crazy for me has been popping up random guis that i think have not been used
bug-reports 2022-04-02 15:31:12 these were the first one i found
bug-reports 2022-04-02 15:31:22 yh
bug-reports 2022-04-02 15:33:13 i onced got spawned as a noob avatar too
bug-reports 2022-04-02 15:33:51 sometimes, when i spawn on the water then quickly despawn, my avatr starts to swim mid-air
bug-reports 2022-04-02 15:34:20 is it common
creations-chat 2022-04-02 15:46:57 i dont think its for design, its more for explosion and dying
bug-reports 2022-04-02 15:53:26 when its roblox you know its going to take a while üòâ
bug-reports 2022-04-02 15:53:43 what do you think of this tho?
bug-reports 2022-04-02 15:53:53 or this
bug-reports 2022-04-02 15:54:37 im guessing parts of the game getting leaked (in plane crazy 1) is not a big deal right?
bug-reports 2022-04-02 15:54:56 becausepc2 will explode and no one will pay attention to pc1 too much anymore
bug-reports 2022-04-02 15:56:52 your pfp..
bug-reports 2022-04-03 04:12:37 not anymore
bug-reports 2022-04-03 04:19:05 but i think the problem is that theres guis that arent used yet in the starter gui that have visibility turned off but somehow when i played/entered plane crazy they were visible (some of them) and i think this is a important thing to fix and can be used in the next plane crazy, i think moving the unused guis to lighting or replicated storage at their own folder is a good idea
bug-reports 2022-04-03 04:19:52 so they are more secure
bug-reports 2022-04-03 11:13:01 Roblox servers caused it, but moving the unused gui will stop it
bug-reports 2022-04-03 11:13:34 Guis wint apear if you put them in pughting
bug-reports 2022-04-03 11:13:36 Lighting
bug-reports 2022-04-03 11:13:58 Its literally just moving from starter gui to lighting
bug-reports 2022-04-03 11:14:24 Yes it does
bug-reports 2022-04-03 11:15:07 It might leak more important "in development" guis that are not supposed to be shown in their future games
bug-reports 2022-04-03 11:15:17 Im just suggesting
bug-reports 2022-04-03 11:15:49 Yes im aware
bug-reports 2022-04-03 11:16:06 ...
bug-reports 2022-04-03 11:16:17 How can you be so sure it will be fix?
bug-reports 2022-04-03 11:16:22 Not*
bug-reports 2022-04-03 11:16:42 Its not scripting
bug-reports 2022-04-03 11:16:54 Its on properties of the gui
bug-reports 2022-04-03 11:17:04 If turningg off visiblity of the gui is not secure
bug-reports 2022-04-03 11:17:15 And can be turned on somehow by roblox problens
bug-reports 2022-04-03 11:17:25 Moving that unused gui to lighting
bug-reports 2022-04-03 11:17:30 Can make it more secure
bug-reports 2022-04-03 11:17:47 Its not fixxed
bug-reports 2022-04-03 11:17:54 Only me got this problen
bug-reports 2022-04-03 11:18:13 Not this problem
bug-reports 2022-04-03 11:18:29 This,
bug-reports 2022-04-03 11:19:05 Yes
bug-reports 2022-04-03 11:19:23 Because that gui that apeared
bug-reports 2022-04-03 11:19:27 Is still in starter gui
bug-reports 2022-04-03 11:19:34 And just had visibbilty truned off
bug-reports 2022-04-03 11:19:40 Yess
bug-reports 2022-04-03 11:19:43 Roblox caused it
bug-reports 2022-04-03 11:19:51 But it can be fixed in studio
bug-reports 2022-04-03 11:20:12 I will give you roblox dev forums link
bug-reports 2022-04-03 11:20:21 Its confirmed duhh
bug-reports 2022-04-03 11:20:25 Why?
bug-reports 2022-04-03 11:21:16 When will you learn that the problem does not require your scripting knowledge to fix
bug-reports 2022-04-03 11:21:25 Its literally just the properties
bug-reports 2022-04-03 11:21:37 (Drag the exposed gui to another tab)
bug-reports 2022-04-03 11:21:40 Its that simple
bug-reports 2022-04-03 11:21:55 Thats not the problem
bug-reports 2022-04-03 11:22:00 Its gui
bug-reports 2022-04-03 11:22:13 So you are sayying
bug-reports 2022-04-03 11:22:17 That the buttons
bug-reports 2022-04-03 11:22:20 On your screen
bug-reports 2022-04-03 11:22:23 Are not gui?
bug-reports 2022-04-03 11:22:47 And instead called (disapearing rockets or invisible builds)
bug-reports 2022-04-03 11:23:25 Is this not a gui?
bug-reports 2022-04-03 11:23:46 If you dont understand, thats not my problem
bug-reports 2022-04-03 11:23:53 But what im sayying is
bug-reports 2022-04-03 11:24:30 Roblox servers caused the problem (you just said it, and you are right)
bug-reports 2022-04-03 11:24:54 But within roblox studio plane crazy place, it can be fixed
bug-reports 2022-04-03 11:24:58 Finding that gui
bug-reports 2022-04-03 11:25:04 That was leaked in my screen
bug-reports 2022-04-03 11:25:11 In the roblox studio plane crazy placr
bug-reports 2022-04-03 11:25:21 And then moving it to lighting
bug-reports 2022-04-03 11:25:38 Instead of leaving it in startergui when its not even used
bug-reports 2022-04-03 11:25:47 Im not sayying this is required to do
bug-reports 2022-04-03 11:25:59 Im just sayying that it could be done in future projects
bug-reports 2022-04-03 11:26:22 To avoid the gui leak again
bug-reports 2022-04-03 11:27:14 And if i still face this problem again (even tho the servers are fixed)
bug-reports 2022-04-03 11:27:26 That means roblox itself wasnt involved
bug-reports 2022-04-03 11:27:32 But something triggering it
bug-reports 2022-04-03 11:33:31 Try to get someone else to do it

creations-chat 2022-04-03 15:47:12 What do you think would fit for a tripod build?
help 2022-04-03 16:07:14 If you add a resistance at the back of e plane and its face facing 45 dg it will make the back go down and the front go up, resulting to a yaw
help 2022-04-03 16:07:33 Watch how planes move in youtube first, before you play the game
help 2022-04-03 17:01:50 When you are in a car, open up a window, make your hand flat and facing where the car is facing, if you feel like something is pushig your hand  thats called wind/air resistance, now try making your hand face down or up, you will feel less resistance
help 2022-04-03 17:06:13 It is the reason for movement of a plane, you can see the aelrons moving when the plane wants to move, that moving flap is creating resistance, but since a plane is on the air not on the ground, it can freely move instead of the plane resisting the wind instead
creations-chat 2022-04-03 17:06:53 Okay thank you
bug-reports 2022-04-03 18:10:42 wow

<@685909594932773033>  thank you for your honest opinion, i will learn from it üëç this stupid slow mode is annoying
creations-chat 2022-06-23 16:02:05 idk i just felt like it, im a 3d artist i like recreating stuff and make them as accurate as possible i was a 5 year old ok? i dont think its neccecary to talk about my username
creations-chat 2022-06-23 16:04:15 i could probably export the helicopter from roblox studio to blender and make a gfx from it! but since roblox exports textures to blender really bad i haev to remake the textures aswell
creations-chat 2022-06-23 16:06:37 textures looks bad so far, but it will be finished soon.. like soon, hold on slow mode is still counting
creations-chat 2022-06-23 16:08:39 not.. in blender, in studio then i just imported it to blender wh- WHY SO MUCH QUESTIONS WHITH WTHIS STUPID SLOW MODE (this quewstion on top of me, yes i might make one)
