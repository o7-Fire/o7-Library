creations-chat 2021-07-01 07:27:03 He's just a fool. He thought it was very funny and original... nope
bot-central 2021-07-01 07:59:07 expert server kinda empty

creations-chat 2021-07-09 12:47:37 Progress does not stand still ~~for too long~~
i hate building mechs now tbh
creations-chat 2021-07-09 13:01:43 <@!441939688018935818> inspired by this devil
creations-chat 2021-07-09 13:04:47 Yes, the style. I just mean its just very difficult to see details, especially in shadow zones
creations-chat 2021-07-09 13:13:46 I will make normal arms instead those mad gatlings
creations-chat 2021-07-09 13:16:02 Whole mech is poseable as you can see... Only poseable, lol
creations-chat 2021-07-09 13:41:16 I would be happy to make 100% of the possibilities, but in this case, the game, as well as the number of keys on the keyboard will not allow me to achieve this.
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
creations-chat 2021-07-09 13:44:31 <@!712273624865701921> The last time I made a robot in another game (by the way, my first and last mech), it could move independently by itself, crouching, fight in action, and there was also a posing mode with almost all of the above features. Btw game is MachineCraft
creations-chat 2021-07-09 13:58:01 It can be possible only if we can do hotkeys instead single key for motors and others. Like Shift+Keybutton or Key1+Key2. I hope rick will add this into PC2

creations-chat 2021-09-18 09:39:06 #creations got manually hidden from everyone
creations-chat 2021-09-24 13:59:24 The rear view mirrors is pure harassment. The front lights should be round, and not with a sharp end on top. No turn signal lights. The shape of the hull is not very well... But anyway, not bad for start

creations-chat 2021-09-27 07:48:47 i wish to turn on outlines once again, so its much more comfortable to build...
creations-chat 2021-09-27 07:52:06 there is also almost no motorlocks... Today, people are too arrogant and dislike everything where there are no motorlocks
creations-chat 2021-09-27 08:35:42 <@!447221768520859659> just tell them what a boeing it was
creations-chat 2021-09-27 10:07:58 Jesus Christ... You guys like two children arguing about some misunderstanding. You think you both are right. You still will not convince each other and will not force you to change your point of view. At least go other channel. who complained about "Let other ppl use this channel" huh?

creations-chat 2021-09-28 09:30:32 it still exist, just **now** its harder to get than any X rank role
creations-chat 2021-09-28 09:32:42 same requirements, but standarts raised ***incredibly*** because a lot people got that role already

<@!401530469952389130> as i said, make an unique design
creations-chat 2021-09-28 09:35:14 No, its still a car
creations-chat 2021-09-28 09:37:18 uh, you dont understand me...
1) its not a design, just some mechanism
2) Sakura already did something like this but better ig
3) its too simple
creations-chat 2021-09-28 09:39:28 And it should looks very good. Last time voting for Designer role was of something what got in HoF. This guy *did not* get designer role anyway, even his craft was in HoF.

Maybe im saying something wrong, you guys better ask mods about it ~.~

it need more than 3x3 free space inside hull

creations-chat 2021-10-07 14:02:44 <@!718409831639154718> Did you literally mock him and expect him not to take offend at you? I think if you had refrained from silly ridicule, he would not have treated your helicopter so biased

creations-chat 2021-11-29 19:35:30 hi <@!466793357318815744>
creations-chat 2021-11-29 19:38:22 its a first build __in plane crazy__
Before i played MachineCraft and there is abonded 2016 craft:

so i cant say that t-34-85 is really so good for me (i just learned PC mechanics)
creations-chat 2021-11-29 19:44:39 and this is my 2nd ever (and last lol) tank in plane crazy. And *this* one i already like a lot, its neat even nowaday.
this pure chaos had reloading mechanism for 4 shells and ***no motorlock***
creations-chat 2021-11-29 19:47:53 ngl i have seen better (in some ways) t-80um2 (obj640) by ComradeZay. There it is (it was easy to find)
creations-chat 2021-11-29 19:54:29 Чел...

creations-chat 2021-11-30 12:45:07 thx
creations-chat 2021-11-30 12:48:27 you just made top part 15x16
creations-chat 2021-11-30 12:52:19 you forgot those pixels so you made it 15x16. Stop arguing
creations-chat 2021-11-30 18:24:43 what the how
creations-chat 2021-11-30 22:14:00 <@711511068760997931> im confused how community disliked your flankers more than my shitty t34 85 <:m_:778994206948589638>
creations-chat 2021-11-30 22:25:43 idk idk man, community is kinda biased nowaday. Look here, this su-30sm didnt had any motorlock
creations-chat 2021-11-30 22:28:36 i mean, people can downvote for little mistakes and wont even look at anything good. I remember how they just destroyed kinda accurate decent roscale ka-50, this moment was horribly unfair
creations-chat 2021-11-30 22:33:32 this ka-50 (i dont have any other images, they make this person even delete post)
he remade wings on finished
and hide most motorlocks
bruh just let my try to find it finished
creations-chat 2021-11-30 22:37:03 so people hated it so much just only for rotor <:m_:778994206948589638> 
btw he remade rotor with my advices but didnt post it updated version becasue dont wanted to be bullied here again
creations-chat 2021-11-30 22:41:40 <@!738064035135750224> the vtol is not bad but engines are meh. I cant believe that those engines can holds on such thin supports (on air lol?)
(and if its cargo vtol, why so much weapons 💀 )
also why tail rotor?
creations-chat 2021-11-30 22:43:51 yep i understand. But shouldnt it be at least believable? apocalyptic = lower quality materials (isnt it so? like hard to find strong enough support materials) => thicker supports
creations-chat 2021-11-30 22:46:04 yea, weapons and tail rotor is ok for custom, but those engines supports triggers me most
creations-chat 2021-11-30 22:56:23 i didnt harassed you, you asked for opinon
creations-chat 2021-11-30 23:59:21 What the fucking hell you're still arguing that vtol
creations-chat 2021-12-01 00:02:58 <@404632014189494293> its apocalyptic. Creators can have not enough knowledge and techs to make each engine independent. Ez explaining from me and idc if its wrong

creations-chat 2021-12-01 17:39:17 <@!678986403153182772> it should be like so
oh ok, understood
creations-chat 2021-12-01 17:44:19 tbh i liked previous design better. Wheels before looked more massive, more offroad-like imo.
People saying that using half cyl as rims is always bad, but i think sometimes its best for current vehicle, check my cars VVV
creations-chat 2021-12-01 17:47:00 its old abandoned project
bruh

creations-chat 2021-12-01 20:09:16 <@!738064035135750224> i didnt do anything bad from my side. Sorry if you taking jokes so serious. ||*but if you actually want i can make you feel worse with just single image*||
creations-chat 2021-12-01 20:11:21 It's "not nice" to take criticisms as an arguments. But simple jokes about words not even in your direction isnt so bad as you saying

help 2021-12-14 22:45:20 By motorlock towers i mean actual TOWERS. You made it too compact, so there lack of details. Dont be afraid to stack motorlocks a lot, thats normal nowadays
