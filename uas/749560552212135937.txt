creations-chat 2023-02-10 03:16:04 "the sequel to plane crazy will eventually come, but it will not receive as much attention as the original once had"
creations-chat 2023-02-21 21:21:35 3 years of experience lead me to this?
creations-chat 2023-02-21 21:33:59 Ah yes the quality just got better from 144p to 480p
creations-chat 2023-02-21 22:28:52 Looks like does Minecraft mods with almost zero effort done amirite?
creations-chat 2023-02-22 00:43:03 Understandable. For transformers in plane crazy you have to actually sacrifice atleast one of the alt modes to get good results for the other
creations-chat 2023-02-22 00:47:25 I sometimes make transformers that are more focused on robot mode but alt mode usually looks meh. (I usually just do them on their Cybertronian alt forms so I don't have to copy a certain vehicle)
