bug-reports 2020-05-19 15:58:06 My issue is that on this File, I am unable to place any more blocks unless I delete another one. What's strange is that this isn't my largest file, it's a little over 2500. (My largest file is around 3500.) My save Data is at 198.832, and when I manually save it to the AutoSave, it goes up to 223.
bug-reports 2020-05-19 16:00:01 Such as the 1x1's?
bug-reports 2020-05-19 16:00:24 I haven't checked that, let me see...
bug-reports 2020-05-19 16:02:44 Well, that was my problem. :/ I haven't ever really bothered to check how many blocks I have used. But I guess I should keep that in mind now.
bug-reports 2020-05-19 16:03:06 But thank you.
bug-reports 2020-05-19 16:03:34 I do have another slight issue though,
