plane-crazy 2020-07-04 15:33:31 cause it flies more like a plane but its main propulsion is rotors
plane-crazy 2020-07-04 15:33:20 idk
plane-crazy 2020-07-04 15:24:52 https://gyazo.com/a3cf7b649d1c06889697376ba454012d
plane-crazy 2020-07-04 15:24:52 help is this a helicopter or plane because it flies like a plane but its a helicopter
plane-crazy 2020-05-16 20:44:52 and not the actual real turret
plane-crazy 2020-05-16 20:44:46 why did you give it the wot turret
plane-crazy 2020-05-14 23:17:56 also, make the propellers using control surfaces
plane-crazy 2020-05-14 23:17:43 thats what i did with my quad
plane-crazy 2020-05-14 23:17:37 i would just make it with a skeleton frame
plane-crazy 2020-05-11 16:30:20 rip
plane-crazy 2020-05-11 16:30:19 not sure how to do it tho
plane-crazy 2020-05-11 16:30:18 i think i shouldve made the scanning radar a bit taller
plane-crazy 2020-05-11 16:27:46 https://gyazo.com/90b764347e257f2f67dcc732b2a69867
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 00:27:20 because i would rather not have my car bouncing constantly while im SITTING STILL
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 00:27:08 what suspension settings makes suspension less bouncy
plane-crazy 2020-03-25 17:09:33 a
plane-crazy 2020-03-25 15:49:49 i wanted to make it using hover engines
plane-crazy 2020-03-25 15:49:33 aaaaaaaaaaaa
plane-crazy 2020-03-25 15:49:32 helpp i dont know how to make this
plane-crazy 2020-03-25 15:49:17 
plane-crazy 2020-03-25 15:33:57 that looks like a nacelle
plane-crazy 2020-03-25 15:25:47 yak-15 is what i meant
plane-crazy 2020-03-25 15:24:18 hold on.
plane-crazy 2020-03-25 15:24:16 o
plane-crazy 2020-03-25 15:23:47 maybe that one yak jet with the jets on the bottom
plane-crazy 2020-03-25 15:23:39 uh.
plane-crazy 2020-03-25 15:23:37 o
plane-crazy 2020-03-25 15:22:55 ho 229 perhaps then
plane-crazy 2020-03-25 15:22:51 o
plane-crazy 2020-03-25 15:22:50 maybe one of the german jet bombers?
plane-crazy 2020-03-25 15:22:45 uhh.
plane-crazy 2020-03-25 15:22:39 i would reccomend using real measurements just to estimate the actual size
plane-crazy 2020-03-25 15:22:09 ive tried making that in stormworks
plane-crazy 2020-03-25 15:22:03 oh
plane-crazy 2020-03-25 14:49:36 well no shit
plane-crazy 2020-03-25 14:48:25 i wanted to ask him for some tips cause im still really new to trying to make ships
plane-crazy 2020-03-25 14:48:16 what happened to that dude that made a mini steam liner?
plane-crazy 2020-03-25 14:47:12 also nice
plane-crazy 2020-03-25 14:47:09 i would try to use wedges on your builds
plane-crazy 2020-03-25 14:46:54 one thing though
plane-crazy 2020-03-25 14:46:41 i think it was a cargo ship
plane-crazy 2020-03-25 14:46:35 i dont remember what my first ship was
plane-crazy 2020-03-25 14:46:25 yikes
plane-crazy 2020-03-25 14:46:13 cause im still used to making things solid rather than like that
plane-crazy 2020-03-25 14:45:47 i would make a ship but i really need to do my research into making folds
plane-crazy 2020-03-25 14:45:22 nice
plane-crazy 2020-03-25 14:45:21 tru
plane-crazy 2020-03-25 14:45:07 is that a ship or a house btw?
plane-crazy 2020-03-25 14:45:02 they should work like how ramming works in space engineers
plane-crazy 2020-03-25 14:44:43 and just flying off after they hit someone
plane-crazy 2020-03-25 14:44:38 plink
plane-crazy 2020-03-25 14:44:35 i wish cutters did more damage than just going like
plane-crazy 2020-03-25 14:41:52 ive had difficulties getting magnet guns working honestly
plane-crazy 2020-03-25 14:41:25 ye
plane-crazy 2020-03-25 14:41:11 yeah
plane-crazy 2020-03-25 14:41:03 <a:ThinkFall:405404435544801281>
plane-crazy 2020-03-25 14:40:57 can you use conveyors as a gun?
plane-crazy 2020-03-25 14:40:52 wait
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 07:56:49 i know ive said that like 5 times tonight but aAAA
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 07:56:32 i need to sleep anyway
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 07:56:10 i mean slightly better than the old version
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 07:56:03 no
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 07:55:21 i dunno
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 07:55:03 honestly i definitely think le bote rebooted is at least slightly better as far as balancing, it isn't too annoying to grind
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 07:54:07 yeah fair
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 07:52:53 not sure
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 07:52:50 oh wait i don't think that's in rebooted
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 07:52:25 cause they never die
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 07:52:18 actually i would argue that a carrier fleet with repair ships is more meta
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 07:51:29 but at least you progress faster
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 07:51:14 true
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 07:50:19 le bote rebooted is better
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 07:50:07 change my mind warships sucks
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 05:59:49 sorry my brain isn't working
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 05:59:45 oh wait
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 05:59:37 true but it just kinda looks weird and top heavy imo
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 05:59:23 like, reference something like the kiev
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 05:59:02 also serious critique of your boat tho. i would make it wider
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 05:58:49 why not make it go fast with just motor power
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 05:58:32 conveyor engine kinda ew tho
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 05:51:09 change my mind trimarans are cool
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 05:49:38 yeah there is
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 05:49:35 O
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 05:49:22 that's a helicopter carrier
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 05:48:54 also i read it
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 05:48:46 yes i have but ree
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 05:47:19 wasn't talking about the tog
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 05:47:13 yes i know
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 05:46:50 alot of them are paper tanks but yeah
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 05:46:20 tog 2
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 05:45:55 oh fair the kiev kinda isnt
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 05:45:41 yeah
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 05:44:04 there is, there's like a french one and a couple russian ones i know of
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 05:43:36 what
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 05:43:03 >has like 3 turrets with 4 guns
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 05:42:50 "light"
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 02:01:18 you were barely on tho
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 02:01:14 WAIT I REMEMBER YOU ACTUALLY
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 02:01:06 i know the original pe-
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 02:00:59 i dunno
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 02:00:57 at least i think it isnt
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 02:00:56 also oof that isnt your ship vip but it doesnt really matter, the game is old af anyways
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 02:00:16 yeah ik
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 01:54:48 though it tended to be weird and not connect accurately
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 01:54:29 a game i used to play called space construction had that
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 01:54:15 or like blocks that actually weld you rather than how magnets do
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 01:54:03 yeah those would be nice
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 01:53:07 oh wait magnets weld to stuff too dont they?
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 01:52:52 just kinda an idea for my zeppelin tho
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 01:52:45 magnets would work pretty well for folds tho, especially if like, the original fold motor gets destroyed
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 01:52:15 true
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 01:51:59 cause they like, pull in for some reason when you dont move them
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 01:51:45 instead of using suspension you can use locked motors
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 01:51:35 WAIT THOSE ARE ACTUALLY REALLY GOOD FOR MAKING STUFF THAT NEEDS TO GO DOWN
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 01:05:13 jesus
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 01:05:08 NHB5QJU9A59E45H
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 01:04:38 sure
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 01:04:28 reeeeee
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 01:04:26 that and i cant fold for shit
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 01:04:06 i would make the bismarck or something but i dont have jetpack, thats one thing thats really needed
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 01:03:38 noice
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 01:03:33 maybe ill think about doing that later
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 01:03:25 actually yknow what im just gonna go with what i wanted to do before
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 01:02:52 the loading stuff below it
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 01:02:47 yknow what i mean
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 01:02:45 well sorta
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 01:02:44 not just the turret tho, like, it has the decks below it and stuff
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 01:02:16 im probably just gonna wing it but reee
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 01:02:03 i wanted to make like, a battleship turret with details and stuff inside
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 01:01:53 OH i remember that idea i had a few hours ago
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 01:01:22 i need to get better at making a zeppelin tho
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 01:01:13 i meant something that could take hits and still be able to fly but look cool while its damaged i dunno
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 01:00:59 aaa nevermind
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 01:00:28 i dunno
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 01:00:22 like, i wanna make something big that can get shot at and just kinda look cool as it gets destroyed
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 00:59:41 aaaaaaaaaa
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 00:59:40 im too lazy
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 00:59:34 ive always wanted to make something big, like a zeppelin or something but
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 00:59:12 i mean it actually flies pretty nice tho but aaaaaaa
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 00:59:02 at least in like. design
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 00:58:47 https://gyazo.com/0c16ea85a573637c37103c610f31ceca
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 00:58:46 but i have so little mental energy the only thing i could make would be another variation of this
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 00:58:12 aaaaaaa i want to make a plane but like
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 00:57:50 i mean flash's 103 was the 103-0 anyways
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 00:57:36 oof
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 00:57:20 im dumb
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 00:57:19 oh wait its the 103-0
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 00:56:50 to check
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 00:56:45 im too lazy to get on wot
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 00:56:38 i  think its 103a
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 00:56:24 its like the 103a except with side skirts i guess
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 00:56:04 except mine has side skirts
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 00:55:54 oh yeah
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 00:55:14 its hard to make the weird fence thing on the front tho
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 00:55:01 yeah
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 00:54:47 kinda
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 00:54:44 hm
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 00:54:15 huh
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 00:54:06 but i added side skirts and lights and stuff
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 00:53:59 but yeah its basically flashfantom's strv
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 00:53:51 https://gyazo.com/3197f0e6f2c2d63a459b46a9f9c085a1
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 00:53:36 but i dont want to modify something ive already got
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 00:53:26 true
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 00:53:05 flashfantom
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 00:53:00 its literally just flash's 103 but he let me copy it
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 00:52:31 aaa
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 00:52:30 i could make that but i dont want to modify the strv 103 i already have
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 00:51:56 a fucking strv 103 hover tank
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 00:51:45 
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 00:51:42 oh my god i look up hover tank and the first thing i see
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 00:51:03 i might make a hovertank actually
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 00:49:06 i dont know what to make
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 00:49:03 no creativity
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 00:48:58 i have like
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 00:48:57 h
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 03:59:01 rip
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 03:51:29 like it was basically entirely made of cutters
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 03:51:20 i made a machine that was literally designed to tear holes through stuff by blacklist cutters
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 03:50:53 yeah blacklist cutters are super op
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 03:48:08 superstrength?
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 03:48:03 o wait hold on
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 03:47:52 it goes pretty slow
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 03:47:49 i just made it myself
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 03:47:41 it isnt that fast tbh
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 03:46:21 yeah
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 03:46:16 oh
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 03:46:05 well wall or platform
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 03:46:02 just make a big platform or something
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 03:45:45 you can i think
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 03:45:42 thing is shell ejection would be impossible
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 03:45:32 i wish there was explosive immune blocks so you could make like, proper guns
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 03:44:50 yeah.
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 03:44:49 rip
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 03:44:48 i dont think you can fit sabot in that sadly
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 03:44:27 its armor piercing fin-stabilized discarding sabot rounds
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 03:44:07 wait
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 03:44:07 okay no that would be too complex-
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 03:43:45 wait hold on i want to try making apfsds
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 03:43:06 hank if you can figure out a way to make those create recoil that would be insane
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 03:42:58 i dont think you can fit cutters in these tho
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 03:38:15 i guess?
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 03:38:09 sorta
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 03:33:13 shove them using magnets
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 03:33:10 just like
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 03:33:03 but you need a crap ton of it
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 03:32:59 yeah
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 03:32:32 thats interesting
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 03:31:52 hold up
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 03:31:50 shells?
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 03:31:47 wait
plane-crazy 2020-01-25 04:20:46 better than my first LMAO
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 16:55:52 nevermind
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 16:55:37 obcpro can i see how those thrust vectoring things work
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 16:55:28 aaaaa
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 16:52:58 i think i said that quote wrong lmao
