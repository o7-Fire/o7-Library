creations-chat 2018-11-07 14:44:29 and there's only the left seat
creations-chat 2018-11-07 14:44:44 middle console is ripped out too
creations-chat 2018-11-07 14:45:29 neither of the propellers are there either

creations-chat 2018-11-07 14:49:31 ill try and make a huey since ive had a personal experience with one
creations-chat 2018-11-07 14:50:55 i think the tail rotor is on the wrong side
creations-chat 2018-11-07 14:55:46 some training base in indiana has some broken huey

creations-chat 2018-11-07 15:20:16 id recommend adding propeller blades
creations-chat 2018-11-07 15:20:29 and have the rotors rotate
creations-chat 2018-11-07 15:22:17 half blocks don't generate lift
creations-chat 2018-11-07 15:22:25 the whole point of rotors is to generate lift

creations-chat 2020-03-25 14:05:01 i guess a car with like 3 wedges and no interior means effort to you?
creations-chat 2020-03-25 14:05:04 damn

creations-chat 2020-03-25 14:07:38 i could make a civic better than that kid but i dont want to because civics are SHIT
creations-chat 2020-03-25 14:08:09 was talking to noobdude
creations-chat 2020-03-25 14:08:28 since apparently he thinks that a car with about 2 wedges and no attempt at an interior is effort
creations-chat 2020-03-25 14:09:53 yes
creations-chat 2020-03-25 14:11:35 okay compared to the shit i used to make my mr2 is a million times better
creations-chat 2020-03-25 14:12:01 thats part of why im so defensive about that

help 2020-08-07 16:06:37 i wanna be able to use it in first person
help 2020-08-07 16:07:09 cause motor2s with cameras look weird
help 2020-08-07 16:07:18 well dont work
help 2020-08-07 16:07:38 yeah
help 2020-08-07 16:08:25 what do you mean by that
help 2020-08-07 16:08:28 aa
help 2020-08-07 16:09:06 no if you do that it doesnt stabilize
help 2020-08-07 16:09:18 or do you mean have it aim at the gun
help 2020-08-07 16:10:49 w a t
help 2020-08-07 16:11:02 how do you make it not turn
help 2020-08-07 16:14:00 i dont understand because the camera would still be connected to the turret
help 2020-08-07 16:14:10 or do you mean connected to the hull?
help 2020-08-07 16:15:17 it would still move because the suspension makes the hull bounce
help 2020-08-07 16:16:10 and thats why im trying to make it stabilize so i can use it in first person
help 2020-08-07 16:16:33 well actually i want to make one for its own thing tbh
help 2020-08-07 16:16:38 yes
help 2020-08-07 16:28:32 oh
help 2020-08-07 16:28:46 i meant like using a camera oof

help 2020-10-05 04:36:56 how do i fix the bug where my seat is attached to something with an excessive amount of motor lock
help 2020-10-05 04:37:22 like the gun on my tank has motor lock so i can have more detail
help 2020-10-05 04:37:55 and for some reason it just reaches this like, critical something where my seat is attached to it
creations-chat 2020-12-18 18:26:10 yeah no his is completely different
creations-chat 2020-12-18 18:28:13 similar size but made completely differently
that's the thing with my me 262, people think that its a tutorial as well cause its a similar size to a tutorial 262
creations-chat 2020-12-18 18:30:15 use a variety of blocks, not just cubes.
half wedges and stuff, longer wedges. just experiment with different blocks to see what looks better
creations-chat 2020-12-18 18:32:17 <:KEKW:670310537300672528>
creations-chat 2020-12-25 17:56:11 i wanna try making a harrier at some point
should i?
creations-chat 2020-12-25 17:58:19 i think i could do it considering my me 262's looks. old screenshot but still. also it aint a tutorial, made it from scratch
creations-chat 2020-12-25 18:01:08 im pretty happy with my 262, its one of my best builds, it looks pretty damn close to the real thing imo and its smol
also fair
creations-chat 2020-12-25 18:05:30 i think a good idea would be to reference some kind of 3d model of the thing youre making, or at least rely on multiple angles
the thing with the 229 is that the shape  sucks for pitch authority at least with plane crazy's physics
creations-chat 2021-12-17 23:39:23 i wanted to make like, one of the orbital mac stations from halo but my brain is too small to figure out how to make it move like the game
creations-chat 2021-12-17 23:58:05 nice
