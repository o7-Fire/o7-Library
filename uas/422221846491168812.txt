creations-chat 2020-06-10 20:01:50 it just seems like the only creations that get good vote ratios are recreations of vehicles that exist in the real world
creations-chat 2020-06-10 20:02:11 yeah
creations-chat 2020-10-23 12:33:39 let's see if this plane that i spent hours on still gets a heck ton of downvotes

creations-chat 2020-10-23 13:22:33 *clap clap clap*
creations-chat 2020-10-23 14:12:40 i'm not using it to get upvotes i might make an alt livery for it that isn't one of the flags that i identify with
creations-chat 2020-10-23 14:45:44 the first screenshot of my starship got 11 upvotes o=and only a couple down votes but the second got a bunch of downvotes and zero upvotes 😦
creations-chat 2020-10-23 14:48:45 what else am i supposed to do to make a plane fly well?

creations-chat 2020-10-23 14:53:25 ok
creations-chat 2020-10-23 14:55:09 ok

creations-chat 2020-10-23 15:20:31 how do i make custom wings not have a gap that's a whole block wide?

And I'm like "dang the downvotes on my starship got ahead of the upvotes" I don't know what to do to get people to actually like my creations. I feel like this community favors replicas of real life military vehicles and anything else doesn't do well
bot-central 2020-10-25 22:06:05 How do I suggest?

bot-central 2020-10-25 22:24:33 Wait it sent the first one anyways?
bot-central 2020-10-25 22:29:09 I'm so gonna get a warn for this
bot-central 2020-10-25 22:31:04 Or if one of them is removed pls leave the second
bot-central 2020-10-25 22:37:12 Idk what the mod pinging rules are
bot-central 2020-10-25 22:38:44 Ok so it's pretty relaxed
bot-central 2020-10-25 22:40:38 <@335599526414909451> hope you don't mind the ping. I accidentally sent a suggestion twice because I added an image link to my first and the bot said that the link wasn't allowed so I assumed the suggestion wasn't sent. I feel that the second one better explained my suggestion. Could you please remove the first?

bot-central 2021-04-27 19:14:40 !rank
creations-chat 2021-04-29 12:34:39 Pg99, squish it a bit
help 2021-05-05 22:11:57 why doesn't this rocket that i'm making fly stable?
help 2021-05-05 22:12:15 is it too many wing panels?
help 2021-05-05 22:14:50 yeah
creations-chat 2021-05-05 23:08:44 gonna make this multi stage. i think it looks good right now. it's futuristic so don't ask bout the floating landing engines
creations-chat 2021-05-05 23:16:02 hm those engines don't help..
help 2021-05-05 23:31:41 how do i keep a rocket vertical during propulsive landing?
help 2021-05-05 23:33:44 not even control helps, maybe i need propellers in addition to normal control surfaces?
help 2021-05-06 00:00:35 I got it working. That along with having the center of lift was the solution

help 2021-05-09 01:05:45 Because they don't have collision
creations-chat 2021-06-02 02:56:22 any tips on my Jumpship?
bot-central 2021-06-02 03:04:24 pirate jet is a good one
bot-central 2021-06-02 03:05:09 but i also like Sweepstakes and Empire Ants
the-dump 2021-06-02 03:36:10 My heckin ear
creations-chat 2021-07-25 18:47:18 not how feedback works
creations-chat 2021-07-25 18:49:22 to be fair, i did say that i suck at building anything that's complex :/
creations-chat 2021-07-25 18:51:59 well i know that
help 2021-07-25 19:44:46 i really can't wrap my head around the advanced motor lock stuff :/
help 2021-07-25 20:05:20 for example: lines on cockpits
help 2021-07-25 20:18:41 but i can't figure stuff like that out
help 2021-07-25 20:19:06 and i haven't seen stuff like that in the few tutorials i've watched
help 2021-07-25 20:28:24 unless i can do it with cam lock instead...
help 2021-07-25 20:29:51 nope
creations-chat 2021-07-25 22:28:07 Your homophia seems like a skill issue <:trollface:775024642104229898>
creations-chat 2021-07-25 22:31:21 Lmao you have some insecurities or whatever so you insult others that are living their best lives to cope

creations-chat 2021-07-25 22:46:35 Something definitely happened
help 2021-07-26 01:53:24 Oh I guess delta wings could work. Instead of trying to angle trail parts.
help 2021-07-26 02:21:41 definitely works
help 2021-07-26 02:26:45 just gotta accept some z fighting
help 2021-07-26 02:35:39 Piston lock? That's new to me
help 2021-07-26 02:38:10 how does it work?
help 2021-07-26 02:48:37 alright
help 2021-07-26 02:49:07 how do i lock on command without explosive blocks though?
help 2021-07-26 03:44:53 Think I've figured out piston lock
creations-chat 2021-07-26 15:54:31 any feedback for this wip Douglas X-3? it's going much better than the one i made yesterday so far though
creations-chat 2021-07-26 16:00:52 yeah :/
not really sure how to get that seamless merge
the-dump 2021-07-26 16:08:29 not that that one's enforced in my experience
creations-chat 2021-07-26 18:36:35 dont really care. it works
creations-chat 2021-07-29 20:12:22 futuristic VTOL that i'm working on. any tips? ("delete it" will not even be something that i'll consider) *also don't mind the anchor, it's temporary*
creations-chat 2021-07-29 20:19:38 i guess i brought that one on myself lol
help 2021-07-29 21:20:35 ok is piston landing gear just a bad idea and the game is trying to tell me not to do landing skis that way by breaking the front one?
help 2021-07-29 21:24:38 all jokes aside, is there a way to fix this?
help 2021-07-29 21:24:39 
help 2021-07-29 21:31:06 who needs landing gear when you have a dropdown cockpit seat
creations-chat 2021-07-29 21:44:36 tamibtianic
help 2021-10-28 14:04:30 There isn't a way to make motor 2s go through their restricted motion continuously is there?
help 2021-10-28 14:09:57 Like where it goes to one of its angles and then switches direction and goes to the other, all while holding a single key
help 2021-10-28 14:13:47 I'm guessing not because ornithopters could be much easier to make...
help 2021-10-28 14:13:49 And walkers...
help 2021-10-28 14:53:44 Like this mechanism works for the up and down wing movement but it's big and clunky
help 2021-10-28 15:05:19 I know motor 2 exists. It's not gonna be consistent if I can't hold a key and have the servo cycle while holding it though
help 2021-10-28 15:30:09 Same as you would with planes
help 2021-10-28 21:04:16 and to no one's surprise, motor 2s alone can't get an ornithopter off of the ground
help 2021-10-28 21:16:30 this is what i've got rn
help 2021-10-28 22:17:26 Not sure how to do that in a compact fashion
help 2021-10-28 23:27:20 reports aren't being accepted last i knew
help 2021-10-28 23:27:27 -underandom
help 2021-10-28 23:28:01 i can't work out the wing drive mechanism for my ornithopter
help 2021-10-28 23:35:19 like.. why
bug-reports 2021-10-29 00:13:51 ghost block. nice -_-
bug-reports 2021-10-29 00:14:10 wing panel 1x1 specifically
help 2021-10-29 01:44:45 by all means this should work but the suspension is being fussy
help 2021-10-29 02:09:00 yep
help 2021-10-29 02:09:10 and i figured out the issue up there
help 2021-10-29 02:25:46 noticed that everyone else was kicked
creations-chat 2021-10-29 15:06:16 Uhh
I think that's a war crime <:Thonk:509498568982134816>
creations-chat 2021-10-29 15:09:43 Oh I see
creations-chat 2021-10-29 15:14:07 Also a good loop hole
help 2021-11-01 03:21:33 Oh hey I'm doing the same thing lol
help 2021-11-01 03:21:40 It's not going great
help 2021-11-01 03:22:15 I'm trying to make a compact single seater type
help 2021-11-01 03:22:31 It kinda just flounders on the ground
help 2021-11-01 03:23:08 The wing shape is the least of your worries
help 2021-11-01 03:23:33 I don't think you'd be able to fit a good mechanism inside the body
help 2021-11-01 03:24:19 Definitely won't fit
help 2021-11-01 03:25:33 No I just got off
help 2021-11-01 03:27:35 Yeah
help 2021-11-01 03:27:46 Same reason I'm making a thopter
help 2021-11-01 03:27:59 Even though I haven't read the book or seen the movie
help 2021-11-01 03:28:12 I've done all kinds of searching on the internet
help 2021-11-01 03:29:44 I've also searched for ornithopters in the server to get an idea of the mechanisms used in them but they're hard to see with the moving and distance from the camera
help 2021-11-01 03:33:10 You should make it longer
help 2021-11-01 03:33:41 Make the back thin out more gradually
help 2021-11-01 03:37:22 It's just a bit inaccurate
help 2021-11-01 03:37:27 Not really sleek
help 2021-11-01 03:38:37 Ah
help 2021-12-20 22:28:28 why does it gotta be so difficult to make ornithopthers
help 2021-12-20 22:29:40 aircraft that are powered by wingbeat movement rather than propellors or jet engines
help 2021-12-20 22:30:30 alright then
help 2021-12-20 22:30:52 regardless people have made them in PC before
help 2021-12-20 22:31:02 they just aren't common
help 2021-12-20 22:31:10 and are very complicated
events-chat 2022-01-29 02:27:23 Hmm
events-chat 2022-01-29 02:27:40 Wonder what I should make
events-chat 2022-01-29 02:28:18 👍 
Obviously. Legs are gonna be digitigrade no matter what
events-chat 2022-01-29 02:31:29 Most likely to do a fox-like quadruped
events-chat 2022-01-29 02:40:34 Shouldn't be crazy hard
events-chat 2022-01-29 03:07:40 Make a mech
events-chat 2022-01-29 03:11:12 Oh that
events-chat 2022-01-29 03:11:28 Is already over
events-chat 2022-01-29 05:40:52 day one. very bare.
events-chat 2022-01-29 14:44:41 Alright
events-chat 2022-01-31 05:26:03 Gotta make something for this soon
events-chat 2022-01-31 05:28:44 Nope we've got a week
events-chat 2022-01-31 05:29:22 A week to fine time aesthetics and functionality. As some people may know, I'm bad at both.
events-chat 2022-01-31 05:40:34 No explosives for weapons
events-chat 2022-01-31 13:36:22 What's wrong with Minecraft?
events-chat 2022-01-31 16:04:50 Should I make an Imperial Eagle for the event?
events-chat 2022-01-31 16:05:21 It's a ship from Elite Dangerous
events-chat 2022-01-31 16:06:08 
events-chat 2022-01-31 16:06:24 It looks enough like a plane
events-chat 2022-01-31 16:14:25 Ok how about "a heavily Imperial Eagle inspired jet"
events-chat 2022-01-31 16:15:32 <:thconking:535171057649188865>
events-chat 2022-01-31 16:25:57 I'm not hearing a no :D
events-chat 2022-01-31 16:30:10 :c
events-chat 2022-01-31 16:36:10 That's-
events-chat 2022-01-31 16:36:46 A dumb question, I think that's more dumb of a question than my Imp Eagle question
events-chat 2022-01-31 16:39:04 Like I could've made the Imp Eagle without anyone but me knowing what it actually was
events-chat 2022-01-31 16:49:32 Like I think there are probably at most 2 other people in here that know what Elite Dangerous is
events-chat 2022-01-31 16:50:04 Though that is an entirely random guess, it's just not a very well known game
events-chat 2022-01-31 17:17:01 Like I said. At most 2 other people
events-chat 2022-01-31 17:25:54 Is it actually good?
events-chat 2022-01-31 17:26:13 That just looks very unbalanced
events-chat 2022-01-31 17:29:50 Lol
events-chat 2022-01-31 17:32:35 Mine will likely mostly use vectored thrusters for turning
events-chat 2022-01-31 18:38:29 Yeah pretty much
events-chat 2022-02-01 22:34:28 what have i done
events-chat 2022-02-01 22:34:44 why is it acting like it is attached to weak helium
events-chat 2022-02-01 22:35:04 
events-chat 2022-02-01 22:35:57 guess so
events-chat 2022-02-01 22:36:14 i'm just trying to learn camera lock and this happens
bug-reports 2022-02-01 22:38:25 just me or is camera lock acting weird?
events-chat 2022-02-01 22:39:45 well that's something
help 2022-02-01 22:50:22 learning
help 2022-02-01 22:55:24 make the edges slant in more, more clearance = tighter possible turn radius
help 2022-02-01 22:56:59 you're at least gonna want to use wedge 1x2
help 2022-02-02 02:44:49 I don't think ignore self prevents destruction. I think it just prevents the tnt from chain reacting.
help 2022-02-02 02:45:08 You need private server to turn of tnt destruction
bug-reports 2022-02-02 04:21:03 Guess so
bug-reports 2022-02-02 04:21:12 I seem to have worked it out
contest-chat 2022-04-03 16:52:27 Space :3
contest-chat 2022-04-03 16:53:17 So either gonna restart my Imperial Eagle, or build something like my Arrow Ships that I've made in TerraTech
contest-chat 2022-04-21 01:28:12 Water just said, "I reject your reality and substitute my own!"
events-chat 2022-04-26 01:36:03 Spaceship
events-chat 2022-04-26 01:36:45 Dang
