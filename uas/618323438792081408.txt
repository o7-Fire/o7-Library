The Tale of syuvi (618323438792081408)
creations-chat 2019-10-30 02:55:54 The Tumbler 1.6 is finally completed! This spacecraft can be used as a rocket, a plane, a car, or even a submarine! This 224 blocks creation is called "the Tumbler" because it always flips upside-down after taking off and will always stay upside-down no matter what happens. By activating all engines while diving down, it can achieve an incredible speed of 660! It has 2 modes, normally it is at air/water mode, by press down the"K" key, it turns on landing/car mode (though still can fly).
