I dont know how to name this 

Please fix the fact that bullets go through the ground, i was playing with my friend in a pvp match. I was on the mountain beside the airport and noticed that bullets from guns can shoot through the landscape. I also heard from a friend that if you are under the map you can shoot bullets from under the map to the top...
