Post the finished product in <#384025409945337856> when its complete, as of now try adding better railing with trails and extending structures forward (like in the picture) and maybe a radar dish on top and some detail with trails aswell.

creations-chat 2022-03-08 00:06:08 Thanks for saying why, I dont really find the exposed lock too bad infact I think it adds detail although I would have hid it if it was a newer build. im aware the belly is a bit blocky but If I add wing panels there it would look really weird and at the moment I dont have motivation to angle lock it also, could you clarify what you think needs piston locking please?
