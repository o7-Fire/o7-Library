creations-chat 2021-12-21 19:10:45 It’s not
creations-chat 2021-12-22 00:16:50 The front of the build could be a little bit better because it looks like a wedge and that’s it but it looks cool anyway
creations-chat 2021-12-22 00:20:46 We’ll never mind it is just my opinion so it doesn’t matter : l

creations-chat 2021-12-22 14:42:18 It’s a catamaran for racing lol it’s supposed to look flat and I didn’t do an inclosed design so that’s why
creations-chat 2021-12-22 14:44:26 <@!584447833214681101> feedback please
creations-chat 2021-12-22 14:46:31 It’s supposed to be I don’t like it with a lot of detail because then it takes longer to load
creations-chat 2021-12-22 14:48:42 I could I guess I will add details but it’s not gonna be the catamaran I was going of of from irl
