creations-chat 2022-11-20 04:30:21 or maybe roblox's regular shading is meant for little kids with outdated computers
which makes pretty much every build look off one way or the other
creations-chat 2022-11-23 00:09:13 me when the f-35a and the f-16 both have a limit of 9gs
creations-chat 2022-11-23 00:13:33 ima be frankly honest all of that is classified and we dont really know jack shit about the f-35 or su-57
creations-chat 2022-11-23 00:18:13 the f-35 (depending on variant) does about 4-5 sustained gs but to be fair you really dont wanna go too high in Gs anyways cause the speed bleeds way too much
<@610990270846074880> the f-35 is more maneuverable than the f-16 at higher combat loads cause its all stored internally=less drag
also higher AOA limit for the f-35 aswell so remember that too
creations-chat 2022-12-05 15:41:22 china vs having original designs (impossible)
creations-chat 2022-12-05 15:45:14 they totally didnt steal classified f-35 documents to use on their own aircraft
creations-chat 2022-12-05 15:48:27 also that one time they shamelessly copied the sensor system (while stealth limits designs very much there is a good amount of things that just get blatantly stolen)
creations-chat 2022-12-06 04:34:51 the engines on the b-52 are pretty wonky
creations-chat 2022-12-18 03:41:08 intakes are tiny, wings dont sweep, no full moving elevator, exposed lock, canopy makes up 50% of the length, also if it were mini it shouldnt have a 2 wide nose and alot more
creations-chat 2022-12-18 03:45:58 see how the intakes squares and not circular and the wings are higher up than the elevators
creations-chat 2022-12-18 03:53:59 a beter idea would be to use piston lock so you dont have to have the delta wings
creations-chat 2022-12-20 20:18:17 that front view looks goofy asf
creations-chat 2022-12-23 10:45:14 too bad most things that do well in pvp look like dogshit, plane crazy is pretty much about making the most realistic shit you can with the VERY limited resources given at this point
creations-chat 2022-12-23 10:47:59 pvp is a dying gamemode tbh, its just cancer to play cause every plane has the turn rate of an ace combat mig-29 on steroids
i can be glad plane crazy introduced me into learning shit about aviation cause if it hadnt i would have never downloaded dcs

creations-chat 2022-12-26 05:38:09 anyways before i was so rudely interrupted by dyno, the Z will probably teeter on the line for as long as this war is relevant (which probably wont be long, this war is pretty small)
creations-chat 2023-01-03 23:19:00 should be a 3 wide ü•±, u know how big an f-15 is right???

creations-chat 2023-01-03 23:35:07 ive changed my mind, your f-15 should be a 4 wide
creations-chat 2023-01-03 23:37:24 you have my respect for doing the math, i change my mind, <@862160384206962749> do it, it would be funny i think (you could probably make a pretty cool detailed cockpit

creations-chat 2023-01-27 05:07:08 <@842474302585831474> proportions=correct, scale=like 1/3rd bigger than it should but its fine
creations-chat 2023-01-27 05:10:01 imo it looks big enough in game to be acceptable
creations-chat 2023-01-27 05:13:26 now all i have to do is add engines and the elevators which is gonna suck cause im running out of space and the engines are gonna be locked
creations-chat 2023-01-27 05:23:04 man i also dont have enough sparklers available to make the engine designs i wanted to üò≠
creations-chat 2023-01-27 07:49:51 that was hell, time to do it again üêó
creations-chat 2023-01-27 08:21:15 "its just a big cylinder with wings, how time consuming could this possibly be?" - me about 11 hours ago <:stuff:908917207986208828>
creations-chat 2023-01-27 08:40:50 the hard part is getting the engines to align correctly because issues, the design still isnt done cause i gotta add the scoop under the thingy
creations-chat 2023-01-27 08:54:57 yeah, but the wingspan was about 150 blocks long and it took like 4 hours
creations-chat 2023-01-27 09:00:48 just motor lock an extra delta wing on like this

creations-chat 2023-01-28 20:07:04 u should try an fw190, havent seen alot of those
creations-chat 2023-01-28 20:09:56 also finally got the nose gear to go all the way into the fuselage
creations-chat 2023-01-28 20:12:43 dragimo, i might try to add a little cockpit detail

creations-chat 2023-01-29 06:18:22 cause it conflicts with the angle lock i cant do much about it, <@495210490172014612> if u can find a better nose design i will 100% do it

creations-chat 2023-01-30 22:31:20 corsair didnt turn out how i wanted it to so im scrapping it for fw190 dora nine
creations-chat 2023-01-30 22:35:42 it is NOT the most detailed shit, theres other people 100% worth that title lol. i usually dum down my builds cause i want them to actually load in anything but an empty private server
creations-chat 2023-01-30 22:40:31 only thing i got goin for me is that i build fast, thats about it
creations-chat 2023-01-30 22:43:09 i dont usually count but i made my 262 in like maybe 5-6 hours
creations-chat 2023-01-30 22:46:07 either way i usually get all the structual stuff for builds done in less than one day, for painting im just lazy lol. <@695737395961659464> go to a museum for aircraft or something then build it in the game, thats what i did once and it worked pretty well
creations-chat 2023-01-30 22:48:30 if thats how it is i dont really got any tips, it just kinda  happens for me and then i take like a 2 month break
creations-chat 2023-01-30 22:53:19 it isnt bad, its just kinda average like 99% of everybody here, thats just kinda how it is though and going from average to pro is something that takes alot of dedication. i consider my stuff pretty average since its simple asf
creations-chat 2023-01-30 22:57:07 tbf i thought about how to build all this stuff during my burnout so ive kinda got an advantage, also the 262 im actually proud of is a remake of the one i did a day before
just keep trying with it, ive had like 2 builds fail today. my corsair and another fw190 that i started on
creations-chat 2023-01-30 23:16:46 dont worry bout it, at least the 229 got into creations

creations-chat 2023-02-04 01:55:24 average shitty f-14 builders when feedback ü§Ø
creations-chat 2023-02-04 02:01:27 elevators in the wrong place + too small, wing sweep could use the hinge being more inward + piston lock and probably shouldnt be a half block thick because that makes it ugly asf, canopy is too short and the vstabs shouldnt be 1x2, they should be 1x1. theres alot more to overall improve but this is just a start

creations-chat 2023-03-01 18:09:26 idk im not really able to do that type of nose paint due to how i built it

also i might just revise the whole thing like what i did with my 262, only cause theres alot of lock thats unnecessary and driving up the lag. also the canopy isn't the right shape. also the intakes are a little messy and hard to work with because

creations-chat 2023-03-04 11:37:45 my wip f-14 that im considering restarting on has like 20 pistons already

yeah, honestly i think im just gonna wait til pc2 to start on another one so i can go all out and use like 60+ pistons without killing my game
creations-chat 2023-03-04 11:53:44 i put in the engines last (i also built this in like 18 hours overnight so i was tired asf) no
anyways the engines couldnt fit the way they should have so i had to individually motorlock them into the right position, which made a mess

creations-chat 2023-03-04 12:42:11 i messed up the entire section here because its too tall and the canopy makes that more obvious

creations-chat 2023-04-29 21:39:52 how have you spend 14 hours on that young man
creations-chat 2023-04-29 21:42:35 i expect your tomcat to be finished in 14 hours, this took me less than 12 ü•±  too bad i cant spawn it anymore
creations-chat 2023-04-29 21:45:57 i would remake it with a shorter fuselage here along with better intakes cause they are kinda ü§¢ also find a way to get half block thick wings
forgot to mention, i wouldnt use nearly as much piston lock aswell
creations-chat 2023-04-29 21:48:21 yeah this part right here is way too flat and needs an extra angle lock to round it out a little bit
the reason the nose is weird is cause it kinda expands out in a weird way so it makes it a little odd from other povs
creations-chat 2023-04-29 21:52:25 honestly i dont really wanna make another tomcat, f-4e sounds like a much more fun build but i'm afraid it would look very similar to srs
frankly you cant get much better than sr's f-4 lol
creations-chat 2023-04-29 21:56:04 also i dont put like 70% of my day into pc anymore so yeah lol, it would take forever to finish since i have actual hobbies now (insane)
<@456226577798135808> weird nose that i dont feel like doing tbh f-20>
creations-chat 2023-04-30 00:41:07 its quite round young man
yes because the super hornet has a totally different nosecone (its exactly the same)
creations-chat 2023-04-30 00:43:51 also if you care about realism just dont play plane crazy lol
if you care that much about one angle on the nose idk what to tell you
creations-chat 2023-04-30 00:46:51 also i just looked at your original build and you have ALOT more to worry about than just the nose
please discover half blocks please
creations-chat 2023-04-30 00:49:33 the nose also isnt 3 blocks wide
make it 2 blocks wide and your fuel tanks are goofy asf
creations-chat 2023-04-30 00:51:39 looks 2 blocks wide to me
creations-chat 2023-04-30 00:54:48 what are you babbling about, sticknubs f-18 looks fine and its 2 blocks wide
dont use blueprints, they are very misleading because of perspective
creations-chat 2023-04-30 00:58:35 that 3d model innacurate asf just use this legacy hornet model+ irl pictures of a super hornet https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/fa-18-bd-hornet-ec3b72e281b3478199775a0e96368943
i said use this LEGACY HORNET model and just change the inaccuracies with real images of a super hornet

creations-chat 2023-07-03 20:34:22 looking back this b1b was so shit lol
the spine should have been tapered also its way too long
creations-chat 2023-07-03 20:38:49 meh idk about that, that one f-15 in creations looks pretty good, theres just alot more shitty builds cause the new people dont feel as pressured to make something good since most of the good players cant spawn their builds lol
(fuck pistons)
creations-chat 2023-07-03 20:41:49 could use better nossle designs though, along with canopy supports
idk i might make an f-15 soon, the one i have rn is shitty only cause it was a test for variable intakes
creations-chat 2023-07-03 20:44:28 i liked the idea but it ends up taking more space than it has to
creations-chat 2023-07-03 20:47:54 why does your f-22 have draken wings lol, also i dont think stealth aircraft have american flags on em lmao

sorry to break it to you but that isnt quality lol
creations-chat 2023-07-03 20:51:04 how tf do you think these look the same bro

creations-chat 2023-07-03 20:57:26 if you call a pito tube an aerodynamic stick i dont think i should take advice from you

creations-chat 2023-07-03 20:59:59 no one cares about performance in this server because pvp is dogshit lol

creations-chat 2023-07-03 21:07:18 the bar is so low for pvp
this shit dominates, and looks like shit, but i dont play pvp because its shit
creations-chat 2023-07-03 21:12:25 this shit probably performs better than that f-22 amalgamation in pvp
and i wasnt even trying to make it for pvp lol, it was just a test bed for rope actuated wing sweep cause i was curious

creations-chat 2023-07-10 01:47:37 planning out a phantom that im actually gonna finish and put alot of effort in across a few days, not all in one night like alot of my other builds
creations-chat 2023-07-10 01:49:54 nah im prob not gonna participate, i dont feel like designing a custom jet since there are like 2 tri engine fighters that have ever been planned out
also free bad f-14 front half
yeah i saw that its god awful im not building that
creations-chat 2023-07-10 01:53:47 either i make the side of the front section 5 pixels off or piston lock it

i must become mcdonald douglas
creations-chat 2023-07-10 01:58:09 i should just finish the f-4 and put a engine on one of the hardpoints lol

creations-chat 2023-07-10 02:01:49 im done with making 262s, they are such a pain in the ass to get the front landing gear in
might consider the mig though
creations-chat 2023-07-10 02:03:52 its 19 cause of this thingy also the 19 has 2 engines and the 17 has 1
creations-chat 2023-07-10 02:07:00 also i havent ever really done this type of pre-planning when it comes to making stuff so its probably gonna be pretty accurate
creations-chat 2023-07-10 02:20:37 idk maybe, its just the livery on the thing im using so i can use any
i might make a few, turkey, SEA camo, germany, idk i will see
i do really like the refueling thing on the isreali version though
creations-chat 2023-07-10 03:05:16 yeah that one wasnt very efficient
creations-chat 2023-07-10 03:35:30
