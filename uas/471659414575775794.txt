creations-chat 2021-10-11 05:28:55 <@456226577798135808> just a suggestion, lower your saturation(maybe 75%) in your builds especially https://discordapp.com/channels/384021699466756103/384025409945337856/896858802459123722. it is too painful for the eyes and looks unnatural
creations-chat 2021-10-11 06:14:14 i'm not gonna judge you on that, but i meant your creation's colours, too high of a saturation is bad(which is why theres a lot of downvotes), at least in my view point. try to experiment with colour saturation and find the perfect balance.
creations-chat 2021-10-11 06:19:18 np, good luck building
