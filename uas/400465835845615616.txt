bug-reports 2019-12-08 15:48:23 i honestly dont care wat rick does with the game as long as the motor 2 flinging issue is fixed
bug-reports 2019-12-09 01:20:44 can u unupdate something
bug-reports 2019-12-09 01:21:05 cuz i rlly want to test my foldable battleship but i cant spawn it without getting flung

bot-central 2020-02-24 00:55:22 frick i forgot how to suggest
bot-central 2020-02-24 00:57:34 &suggest Add buttons/levers that can activate certain blocks. Make them so u dont have to sit in ur seat so u can interact with the build without the main pilot seat. This way you can open doors without have to run back to ur seat. If this is added, add an option to the buttons/levers that allows other players to use them too.
bot-central 2020-02-24 00:57:44 BRUH

bug-reports 2020-03-12 19:02:52 its updating
bug-reports 2020-03-12 19:04:01 
bug-reports 2020-03-12 19:04:02 its wip
bug-reports 2020-03-12 19:04:11 so the blue and red things r the "players"
bug-reports 2020-03-12 19:04:22 and the legit player controls it from underneath
bug-reports 2020-03-12 19:04:52 
bug-reports 2020-03-12 19:05:00 so the player gets in a closes the doors
bug-reports 2020-03-12 19:05:07 and then they can move using wasd
bug-reports 2020-03-12 19:05:16 and the box is connected to the "player" up top
bug-reports 2020-03-12 19:05:21 for me, the creator
bug-reports 2020-03-12 19:05:26 i can move around fine
bug-reports 2020-03-12 19:05:35 but for other players when they get in the box it barely moves
bug-reports 2020-03-12 19:05:40 btw the box was not my idea
bug-reports 2020-03-12 19:05:50 megladon made it for his game
bug-reports 2020-03-12 19:05:59 and no not a connection problem
bug-reports 2020-03-12 19:06:10 we switched boxes too
bug-reports 2020-03-12 19:06:18 normally i play blue but i went to red
bug-reports 2020-03-12 19:06:25 and both boxes work for me
bug-reports 2020-03-12 19:06:29 but not for other players

bug-reports 2020-03-12 19:10:44 so the other players box is always glitchy
bug-reports 2020-03-12 19:10:48 no matter which box i pick
bug-reports 2020-03-12 19:11:01 when they sprint for some reason they glitch through the box walls and end up outside
creations-chat 2020-03-12 19:12:10 boi
bug-reports 2020-03-13 01:30:21 its an anti lag mechanism i think
bug-reports 2020-03-13 01:30:33 but it identifies the wrong part of the creation sometimes
bug-reports 2020-03-13 01:30:49 so for anti lag it freezes the main body of the creation
bug-reports 2020-03-13 01:31:15 it would be nice if rick removed it
bug-reports 2020-03-13 01:31:21 id rather have functional pvp

bug-reports 2020-03-16 14:56:06 cuz most of the glitches with it occur when it ends up inside other blocks
bug-reports 2020-03-16 14:56:20 so basically allow parachutes to move through other blocks freely

bug-reports 2020-03-20 01:11:51 and then i press the keybind again and then the originally working pistons push and the supposedly broken pistons retract
