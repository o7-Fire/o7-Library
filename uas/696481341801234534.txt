creations-chat 2023-03-08 23:22:03 Is building anything below the waterline of a large ship a good idea? I‚Äôm planning on making a pretty large ship and I don‚Äôt really plan on building the underside since it‚Äôll be a static build for the most part (large ships and mobility do not mix very well for me)
creations-chat 2023-03-12 19:40:49 how are you gonna tell someone to be less toxic (over a joke nonetheless) and then tell them to kill themselves

creations-chat 2023-04-02 21:22:26 anybody have any tips for putting ladders at an angle like this
creations-chat 2023-04-02 21:25:44 that would be caused by the part of the hull directly above it

creations-chat 2023-04-09 21:01:15 added a dining hall to my ocean liner (probably going to take off the half wedges on the plant pots I dont like those)

creations-chat 2023-04-24 20:01:34 thinking about making a 2-account ship
creations-chat 2023-04-24 20:06:21 idk you get an alt account, you make the 2+ parts and then you put them together. how they do it is currently beyond me (as in, moving them together)
creations-chat 2023-04-24 20:58:36 whar?
creations-chat 2023-04-24 23:54:25 and so my journey of 2 account ship begins
paintjob isnt final, still deciding on whether to make it a pre-war or post-war (WW2) liner
creations-chat 2023-04-25 01:32:07 what the hell
creations-chat 2023-04-25 01:34:11 if anybody has any recommendations for what I could model this after I‚Äôm open to ideas
creations-chat 2023-04-25 22:40:29 new paintjob
creations-chat 2023-04-26 20:11:47 mfw I‚Äôm trying to put a superstructure on my ship but 3 floors is too goofy looking and 2 floors is too short
creations-chat 2023-04-26 23:45:29 You should do it again it‚Äôs even funnier the second time
creations-chat 2023-04-29 01:00:12 should I move the front of the superstructure forward
creations-chat 2023-04-29 01:03:16 im not basing it exactly off of anything but im using the SS Nieuw Amsterdam as reference
creations-chat 2023-04-29 01:05:47 I know, Im just not that skilled with camera/motor locking and such
And yes, that ship ^^
also, are you referring to the deck when you say angled?
creations-chat 2023-04-29 01:11:05 also my question still remains unanswered
creations-chat 2023-04-29 03:13:23 wow would you look at that the bow is angled <:noway:1021283202561744977> though i guess its kind of hard to see against the background
creations-chat 2023-04-29 03:55:22 one of my science teachers has a 13 year old son that's 6'4
creations-chat 2023-04-29 03:58:54 thats sick, good luck winning
creations-chat 2023-04-29 04:12:40 front half of my ship is mostly complete structure-wise, nieuw amsterdam influence really shines through in the funnel design/paint, I might change the upper hull to a light gray to more closely match the amsterdam
creations-chat 2023-04-29 04:22:32 opinions on light gray hull
creations-chat 2023-04-29 20:56:39 probably gonna start working on the 2nd half on my alt account, I'll get into the finer details and interior once both sections are structurally finished
creations-chat 2023-04-29 21:27:57 cant stand scallywags
creations-chat 2023-04-30 01:02:02 stern half hull is complete, probably the best ship stern I've built by far even if the rudder looks kinda funny
creations-chat 2023-04-30 02:22:15 rear half of the ship is complete
creations-chat 2023-04-30 03:23:39 I have both sections of my ship mostly complete but I cannot for the life of me figure out how I‚Äôm going to put them together
creations-chat 2023-04-30 19:46:30 with the power of 150-200+ rockets the 2 halves have become whole

creations-chat 2023-05-24 23:19:50 im thinking about making a city block thing and this is the road/walkway layout I have so far (2 accounts)
creations-chat 2023-05-24 23:23:31 most of its probably gonna be "prop" buildings so I don't run out of blocks
creations-chat 2023-05-24 23:53:29 yes
creations-chat 2023-05-25 00:20:46 black areas represent prop buildings, line down the middle road represents division between 2 accounts, going for a 1920-30s style. still thinking about what to make the bottom 2 buildings, don't want to make them shops since i think ive already got enough of those
also proportions will probably be changed and im probably bound to make a lot of changes along the way
creations-chat 2023-05-25 00:49:05 Alright here are the finalized plans. its a bit ambitious but I think I can do it. maybe
creations-chat 2023-05-25 02:07:03 what
