creations-chat 2021-12-05 19:23:44 i guess the reason why all my builds get negative points is because i joined the server this weekend and havent learned what kind of builds yall like

creations-chat 2022-02-27 04:09:54 idek it was in refrences lol. i sadly didnt have enough skill or space to make them retractable.
creations-chat 2022-02-27 04:12:44 there engines are under the wings. They're hard to see since they're the same color as the body
creations-chat 2022-02-27 04:27:01 tbh idk much about planes whats a fuselage?
creations-chat 2022-02-27 04:30:17 well they're not so much stuck to the fuselage as they are stuck to the wings, very close to the fuselage
creations-chat 2022-02-27 04:32:33 one block away from fuselage.
creations-chat 2022-02-27 04:39:44 looks great! thanks!

help 2023-02-17 00:43:59 sorry u were too late i already started work on the first one
help 2023-02-17 00:44:20 i might make the second one later on
help 2023-02-17 00:44:42 i like the first two because they have itneresting tails instead of the basic three pointed model
help 2023-02-18 05:40:44 anybody know how to fix this plane?

help 2023-02-21 03:53:25 do yall know how to make a tandem rotor heli stop spinning?
help 2023-02-21 03:53:42 it has fake rotors but still spins when it goes upwards
help 2023-02-21 03:53:52 i havent finished the controls yet but i've noticed this on test runs
help 2023-02-21 22:12:40 no
help 2023-02-21 22:12:53 like a real tendem rotor they spin in opposite directions
help 2023-02-21 22:16:34 it looks kinda bad but this shows how it spins
(ik i didnt fly up but it still showcases how the rotors cause it to spin drastically)
help 2023-02-21 22:25:04 i tried reversing the rotors but it only helped slightly
help 2023-02-21 22:25:18 (making them move the same direction
