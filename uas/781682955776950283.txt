creations-chat 2021-08-29 22:34:36 I searched up some saturn v tut and it looks so alike, prob just deleted some stuff and posted
creations-chat 2021-08-29 22:36:49 But its meant to look like the irl one like the other tuts and showcases so can't really be saying much here
creations-chat 2021-08-29 22:42:14 Ever heard of anger therapy?
creations-chat 2021-08-29 23:24:02 I could if you want but it seems to not be a tut after further searching stuff

creations-chat 2022-07-23 17:34:10 <@803343720048230411> Posted a tutorial build and claimed it as his, and now thinks he‚Äôs entitled to not reading the basic rules of a server

A warship that I‚Äôve made to combine looks with functionality (PVP)

(Zacattack got the footage of my warship btw)
creations-chat 2022-08-25 06:17:07 Very accurate
creations-chat 2022-11-26 14:37:27 It‚Äôs a PVP warship, those are like that for a reason
creations-chat 2022-11-26 14:40:31 Take into consideration that motor lock makes weak points for durability, and durability is needed for it to survive in PVP. Plus, the weaponry will stay the same because that‚Äôs how it fights back, but I might fix some of the radar areas. Also, the stern has large cruise missiles, so it does look quite bland there
creations-chat 2022-11-26 14:50:43 If you don‚Äôt care, I don‚Äôt see why you‚Äôve given other reasons
creations-chat 2022-11-26 14:52:59 And my warships are built to be combat capable against other warships, not just mope around looking pretty
creations-chat 2022-11-26 14:55:07 So‚Ä¶ your saying balancing functionality (pvp wise) and looks isn‚Äôt some form of creative challenge? If so‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm not too sure what you‚Äôre on about so imma just let you say what you want since you won‚Äôt be very helpful
creations-chat 2022-11-26 15:17:33 It seems as if they‚Äôre mocking you for being a furry, if that wasn‚Äôt obvious enough as is. People just tend to look at the questionable furries and go ‚Äúall bad‚Äù
creations-chat 2022-11-26 15:22:50 Sounds about right
creations-chat 2022-11-26 15:25:34 Uncanny how he asks for compassion when he completely dissed somebody earlier and complained how they got more upvotes than him
creations-chat 2022-11-26 15:34:10 So‚Ä¶ because something has some similarities to your build means it should have the same upvotes? Huh?
creations-chat 2022-11-26 15:36:36 You‚Äôre clearly implying said thing but sure
