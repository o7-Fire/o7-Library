creations-chat 2022-08-01 03:53:04 feedback on my F-4 phantom so far? (it does have landing gear it's hidden well though)
creations-chat 2022-08-01 03:55:09 it's my second ever angle locked plane so far so its not the best
creations-chat 2022-08-01 03:58:19 what did i do wrong
creations-chat 2022-08-01 04:00:24 does mine look good so far? I want to make good planes as my last one, my A-10, looks kinda good and has ungodly amounts of angle lock, but is literally 1 block wide and looks bad because of it
creations-chat 2022-08-01 04:05:54 i've been playing plane crazy for like 1 and a half years now but i made my first angle locked plane not long ago, the A-10, which i don't like (for obvious reasons)
creations-chat 2022-08-01 04:08:23 actually the phantom isn't my 2nd its my third, i forgot i started a C-130J a while ago, i'll post the pics under this
creations-chat 2022-08-01 04:11:13 is this a good or a bad oh ok
creations-chat 2022-08-01 04:16:46 now you can violently murder people and show your pride
creations-chat 2022-08-04 05:56:30 I'm working on a Lockheed L-1049 Super Constellation, a old 4 prop engine airliner
help 2022-08-04 05:57:33 anyone wanna help me improve or just get feedback on my wip plane
help 2022-08-04 05:58:54 in <#504436696021204992>
help 2022-08-04 05:58:57 just posted it
help 2022-08-04 05:59:09 i posted more info about it there
help 2022-08-04 05:59:29 yeah i couldn't find anything else
help 2022-08-04 05:59:54 it does rotate though but idk what to do about the emojis
help 2022-08-04 06:00:11 💀
help 2022-08-04 06:01:03 yeah those are good ones but the L-1049 has only one center screen (which idk how to fit in but i'll figure it out)
help 2022-08-04 06:01:26 i used the dials and slider emojis a lot
help 2022-08-04 06:01:32 as well as a lot of the clock emojis
help 2022-08-04 06:01:41 the stopwatch censors so i can't use that
help 2022-08-04 06:02:11 oh btw, i'm also making the plane ro-scale, as in meters to plane crazy blocks
help 2022-08-04 06:02:54 haven't made an airliner in about a year now i think
help 2022-08-04 06:03:08 made one a year ago when i was newer and it sucked (obviously)
help 2022-08-04 06:03:28 I wanna try again at it, although they're very laggy for me cause chromebook
help 2022-08-04 06:03:45 do you think the plane itself looks good so far though?
help 2022-08-05 04:54:39 added more things to interior and added landing gear that hides itself well, any thoughts?
help 2022-08-05 04:55:33 i'll make the landing gear look better in a bit its still a big WIP
help 2022-08-05 05:17:17 it's a lockheed L-1049, look it up if you wanna see more of its design
help 2022-08-05 05:17:28 yeah but i have some limits with that
help 2022-08-05 05:17:53 its as good as i can make it without not being able to make it angled locked
help 2022-08-05 05:20:46 it already is pretty complicated with angle lock and lots of motor locking on just the front, i want to save space on it as much as i can
help 2022-08-05 05:21:21 i don't wanna put too much then lose motivation to continue because i put all my energy on the front of the plane
help 2022-08-05 05:21:48 plus it doesn't need to be spot on
help 2022-08-05 05:22:02 i just wanna have a airliner to take people on trips with
help 2022-08-05 07:38:05 Idk how we'd do that
help 2022-08-05 07:38:24 Ohh
help 2022-08-05 07:38:32 Alr
help 2022-08-05 07:38:43 I can friend you tomorrow as I'm not on my computer rn
help 2022-08-05 07:38:53 Tomorrow
help 2022-08-05 07:39:00 it's not super complicated so far
help 2022-08-05 07:39:04 but it looks good
help 2022-08-05 07:39:36 If you wanna find some good liveries search Lockheed L-1049
help 2022-08-05 07:40:10 Btw, this is one of my first airliners as Im not good with planes
help 2022-08-05 07:40:46 I'm on Chromebook so I lag a lot but I'm getting a actual PC soon
help 2022-08-05 07:40:57 so I won't be lagging really bad forever
help 2022-08-05 07:42:02 The joystick steering things move but I hid the motors so they're hard to see
help 2022-08-05 07:42:17 I've never worked with someone when making a plane before
help 2022-08-05 07:44:41 oh I didn't save pictures but I made the landing gear look a lot better
help 2022-08-07 23:33:56 
help 2022-08-07 23:34:10 how does it look so far
help 2022-08-07 23:34:45 (this pic was before all the new stuff but it has opening doors
help 2022-08-07 23:35:14 It's a Lockheed L-1049 Super Constellation
help 2022-08-07 23:35:25 the longer version of the constellation
help 2022-08-07 23:35:42 it's an old 4 prop airliner
help 2022-08-07 23:36:11 made in 1940's-50's
help 2022-08-07 23:37:05 here's some inside pics
help 2022-08-07 23:37:17 i don't have a picture of the front fully angle locked let me get on rq
help 2022-08-07 23:37:33 
help 2022-08-07 23:37:47 it has landing gear too that is well hidden
help 2022-08-07 23:38:42 (ignore the spring)
help 2022-08-07 23:39:08 yeah some people called it the best prop airliner ever
help 2022-08-07 23:39:19 very pretty plane
help 2022-08-07 23:40:42 yup it did
help 2022-08-07 23:41:10 yeah all the seats were first class
help 2022-08-07 23:41:30 they made an economy one later on but it had few of them built
help 2022-08-07 23:42:08 i only have the stewards area done, i believe that's what it is
help 2022-08-07 23:43:05 the disconnectors are gonna be painted white and it'll look better when finished
help 2022-08-07 23:43:19 still got a lot of seats to place
help 2022-08-07 23:43:32 it can hold over 100 people from what i remember
help 2022-08-07 23:44:08 47-106 apparently
help 2022-08-07 23:44:31 including the 5 crew
help 2022-08-07 23:44:41 so i need to place 101 seats
help 2022-08-08 00:34:55 sorry but if i want to do a good landing in it i cannot remove that suspension
help 2022-08-09 00:05:17 dude this is one of the coolest things i've ever seen in plane crazy
creations-chat 2022-08-16 19:38:30 it's not bad
creations-chat 2022-08-16 19:40:46 that's awesome looking, most ro-scale stuff looks like a kids toy cause of how small it is

help 2022-09-03 04:27:53 sound good? good
help 2022-09-05 22:59:13 does anyone know why people are downvoting my huge
help 2022-09-05 22:59:18 idk what i did wrong
help 2022-09-05 22:59:31 it's as close as you can get in plane crazy to the real thing
creations-chat 2022-09-11 02:27:16 shut up
creations-chat 2022-09-11 02:32:35 K cool cry harder
creations-chat 2022-09-15 03:41:45 looks great but i wish it had treads, although extremely impressive you're on mobile
the-dump 2022-09-16 23:32:08 
creations-chat 2022-09-18 00:12:24 ok i will fix it
creations-chat 2022-09-18 00:14:45 stupid there's stuff behind it, how else would it explode you absolute fucking idiot
creations-chat 2022-09-18 00:17:05 - fucking idiot
creations-chat 2022-09-25 00:37:26 ok go make a better one with no angle lock, i'll wait
creations-chat 2022-09-25 00:40:32 how u talking when this is the kinda shit you make
creations-chat 2022-09-25 00:42:58 that means it's hidden well, if you didn't need glasses as big as the fucking empire state building you might see the obviously locked angles
creations-chat 2022-09-25 00:45:05 not all of it the same color, there's darker and lighter accents that you can't see unless you're in game, also the headlights and pillars are all locked, pillars are each locked twice (one inward one rotated)
creations-chat 2022-09-25 00:47:37 alr
creations-chat 2022-09-25 00:50:05 i'm not fighting anymore
creations-chat 2022-09-25 00:53:19 because i'm not gonna continue an argument with someone who's mind hasn't developed past 6 months old
creations-chat 2022-09-25 00:56:41 i'm not responding to you anymore, goodbye, shut up, leave me be, go find someone else to annoy about how their build isn't accurate because "you missed this by 0.0001 meter 🤓"
creations-chat 2022-09-25 00:59:37 that's a different story, actually bad builds are downvoted for a reason
creations-chat 2022-09-25 01:03:27 my entire life crumbling before my eyes becuse queasysquiddy told me my build wasn't good:
creations-chat 2022-09-25 01:32:43 ALSO i forgot to say i also angle locked the hood

creations-chat 2022-10-04 04:10:30 your builds look like ACTUAL dog shit compared to everything i've made, you literally build like someone who started playing the game a few weeks ago
creations-chat 2022-10-04 04:14:39 if i mentioned angle lock to you your head would fucking explode you idiotic moron, you say i lack motor lock skills, i see no motor lock in any of your builds
creations-chat 2022-10-04 04:16:53 bet none of you fucktards have seen the real thing other then clay of course, he's been in game with my V-1 and with a real life V-1
creations-chat 2022-10-04 04:18:56 "heavily detailed front" literally looks as simple as control panels and blocks, and also it would not be 1x1 unlike all of your "ro-scale" planes that look like RC planes for kids
creations-chat 2022-10-04 04:20:59 it's hard to tell when all your builds look like jokes
creations-chat 2022-10-04 04:23:13 wow you sure have a lot of room to talk when your cars look like a 3 year old's drawings of what a "truck" looks like
creations-chat 2022-10-04 04:25:56 wow bro you really managed to make something look like absolute shit and put so much motor lock in at the same time!!
creations-chat 2022-10-04 04:29:43 bro what the fuck is that, lets just see your absolutely shit truck compared to my good truck
creations-chat 2022-10-04 04:31:49 says the one who's literally never posted in creations , heres more pictures
creations-chat 2022-10-04 04:33:56 i never said it was easier, i said it was stupid to try and make something look good when your arms stick out of it because it's the size of a hotwheels
creations-chat 2022-10-04 04:36:12 you think 1x1 is ro-scale so yes, as clearly stated by the multiple accounts of photo and text proof of you saying 1x1 is roscale

creations-chat 2022-10-14 23:50:44 preparing to be scolded by a nerd
creations-chat 2022-10-14 23:53:09 "🤓"
creations-chat 2022-10-14 23:55:16 imagine being mad because "enginge look bad!!!111!!!" in a block building game where things aren't supposed to look perfect as well as being mad because "not roscale@!!!!!1111 amrs need to sticksa out!!!!!111" and because it doesn't look like a kids toy
creations-chat 2022-10-14 23:57:21 from what i've seen of your builds you make children's toy car scaled builds so shut the fuck up kindly
creations-chat 2022-10-15 00:00:55 lmao no it looks nothing like that you fucking special ed
creations-chat 2022-10-15 00:03:01 the tail is thick? really? its 3 blocks and ends at 1 you fucking dipshit
creations-chat 2022-10-15 00:05:04 they look absolutely nothing alike, the bottom one is way taller and way shorter, it sounds to me like you just are trying to justify your absolute fucking idiocy
creations-chat 2022-10-15 00:07:41 they look almost exactly the same apart from mine being slightly taller at the end point
creations-chat 2022-10-15 00:09:53 you think smaller means better when in reality everything i've seen that's roscale is terrible and looks like the worst thing ever to touch planet earth, you the type of person to look at a build with someone's arms sticking out and upvote it
creations-chat 2022-10-15 00:11:59 THAT is proper ro-scale, most ro-scale is way smaller then real life and it usually looks terrible
creations-chat 2022-10-15 00:16:03 pretty sure the main complaint was the back, is this better?
creations-chat 2022-10-15 00:18:17 <@984694509772357662> <@448677698773057547> now are you happy, is there anything besides the front to fix
creations-chat 2022-10-15 00:20:51 you're right about the front, is there anything besides the front i can do to make it better?
creations-chat 2022-10-15 00:26:58

creations-chat 2022-12-08 03:03:54 i am sorry yall had to see the first pic i realized how wrong i got some things, here's a more accurate one
creations-chat 2022-12-08 03:06:12 it looks ok for a one wide, but i think one wides are ugly  and they make me want to throw up so i'm probably not the best person to ask
creations-chat 2022-12-08 03:08:28 btw, idk if you're good with prop planes but how does my BF 109 look (second pic not first one)
creations-chat 2022-12-08 03:10:51 yes you are correct it does look kinda big now that i see it, can someone but the bp for the BF-109 over my side view? i would but idk how
creations-chat 2022-12-08 03:16:42 nvm but i am pretty close to being accurate, just need to move some things (i physically cannot move the propeller in sadly)
creations-chat 2022-12-08 03:20:13 what??

creations-chat 2022-12-23 21:18:08 even if you are basing yours off "the one from war thunder", it's still inaccurate
creations-chat 2022-12-23 21:20:30 big≠good
if you're gonna make something big you have to make it look good or else the bad things are just even easier to notice
creations-chat 2022-12-23 21:24:00 wtf you mean, im saying you can't make something shitty and big then call it good cause its "to scale" idiot ☠️ ☠️  i was literally saying that because it's to scale doesn't make it good
creations-chat 2022-12-23 21:26:10 yes that looks like shit too
creations-chat 2022-12-23 21:28:50 that one sucks i deleted that version
creations-chat 2022-12-23 21:31:32 at least my builds are accurate to what they try to remake
creations-chat 2022-12-23 21:33:50 sorry i let you know your builds suck  ☠️ (they do)

creations-chat 2022-12-23 21:39:35 as you can see, a wild shader user is in it's natural habitat, sending unfunny responses because they got called out
creations-chat 2022-12-23 21:41:40 damn bro that was mad funny 😐
creations-chat 2022-12-23 21:43:47 wings are too thick, also not shaped correctly, tail wings are way too small, the top window doesn't even have any separators at all, propellers look to be wrong as well, the engine covers are supposed to be thicker than the wing, no lettering on the wings, and the nose is misshaped
creations-chat 2022-12-23 21:45:48 oh yeah thanks for showing me, the wings also aren't angled up like in the photo you just sent to show us how "accurate" yours was (you can very clearly see a bend in the wings from the real photo you sent)  <:clueless:942802644043464734>, also yes them are some minecraft ass wings

creations-chat 2022-12-24 10:05:14 honestly best creation there so far lets get it to HOF
creations-chat 2022-12-24 23:09:34 hugo
creations-chat 2022-12-24 23:11:41 cause they want people to feel bad for them and upvote, they aren't old enough to understand that's  not how it works
creations-chat 2022-12-27 09:58:56 <@636205229905281024> dodge challenged
creations-chat 2022-12-28 10:06:06 
creations-chat 2022-12-28 11:00:50 we cant see functionality in a picture, plus nobody here cares for function they care about looks
creations-chat 2022-12-28 11:03:04 i make sure to mention flaps and landing gear but in reality its just a waste cause nobody really sees stuff for functions
creations-chat 2022-12-28 11:05:09 i myself enjoy seeing functionality and looks together, best of both, but if something looks bad and has good function im a lot more likely to downvote but if it has good looks and bad function im more likely to upvote ONE EXCEPTION is swashplates/mechanical functions showcases, those i just upvote cause they aint supposed to look good
creations-chat 2022-12-28 11:07:41 most of that looks good but that nose is enough to kinda ruin the whole thing, if you just fixed the nose with some angle lock it would probably get a lot of upvotes
creations-chat 2022-12-29 08:31:27 are the vertical stabilizers supposed to be straight
creations-chat 2022-12-29 08:43:21 nvm then
creations-chat 2023-01-01 01:09:09 yeah you can
creations-chat 2023-01-01 01:11:11 you only need 1x2 space for a hover engine, seeing how you set those props up you have plenty of space for a hover engine
creations-chat 2023-01-07 00:05:08 i knew the first 5 seconds after i posted someone would complain ☠️
creations-chat 2023-01-07 00:08:13 oh dang thats funny coming from you
creations-chat 2023-01-07 00:10:34 can't have exposed lock when there is no lock ☠️
creations-chat 2023-01-07 00:12:38 you using a motor 2 to angle the "side pipes" doesn't count as angle lock ,that's just angling also i see a exposed motor <:trollface:775024642104229898>
creations-chat 2023-01-07 00:14:43 wowie you used one simple angle lock, yet it still looks like shit! amazing! you're welcome
creations-chat 2023-01-07 00:27:33 would you rather me have no suspension?? i couldn't fit any other suspension in
creations-chat 2023-01-07 00:29:39 still has it though, if im gonna race at the airport let's say i'm gonna need some suspension to not get launched when i hit the corner of the tarmac or concrete parts
creations-chat 2023-01-07 00:31:46 i made the ride height better for you hunny 🥺 🥺
creations-chat 2023-01-07 00:36:50 barely still means it's there..??
