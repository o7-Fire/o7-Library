help 2022-10-04 23:13:46 its pretty much impossible for me to fill up the gaps because when i add more angle locks the motors teleport to a different angle

help 2023-04-07 00:48:29 is there any fix to this issue
help 2023-04-07 00:48:42 it isnt anchored its just stuck in mid air
help 2023-04-07 05:48:29 i fixed it, apparently the problem was i was detaching the missile with disconnectors and by using springs it did the trick
help 2023-04-07 05:48:49 no idea how that was an issue but its fixed now
