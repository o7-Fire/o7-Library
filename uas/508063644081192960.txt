creations-chat 2020-08-18 20:44:25 ok
creations-chat 2020-08-18 20:44:32 but I recommend longer horizontal stabilizer

creations-chat 2020-08-18 20:44:48 aka elevator
creations-chat 2020-08-18 20:45:51 ok are you trying to make a Learjet

creations-chat 2020-08-18 20:48:29 <@!628417889606565889> your wings should extend from the engine to like the half of your fuselage
creations-chat 2020-08-18 20:48:44 just use this template <@!628417889606565889>

creations-chat 2020-12-20 17:16:01 any feedback on my creation
help 2021-04-19 16:01:19 damping is energy absorption. higher the dampness, the more stable and smooth it is
help 2021-04-19 16:01:44 if you want it to extend smoothly without kinks put up dampness to 100
help 2021-04-19 16:01:49 same goes for wheels
help 2021-04-19 16:02:27 add a counterforce
help 2021-04-19 16:02:35 tail rotor or another propeller spinning other way
help 2021-04-19 16:12:13 do you have any wings on it
help 2021-04-19 16:12:19 its very unaerodynamic
help 2021-04-19 16:12:24 use cylinders
help 2021-04-19 16:12:25 not wings
help 2021-04-19 16:12:33 also add hover thrusters and set them to max drag
help 2021-04-19 16:12:35 itll stabilize
help 2021-04-19 16:13:28 hover thruster on the side works for pitch control but
help 2021-04-19 16:13:36 this one doesnt work,
help 2021-04-19 16:13:40 neither does this
help 2021-04-19 16:13:47 why idk
help 2021-04-19 16:14:09 alright
help 2021-04-19 16:16:27 center ur CG
help 2021-04-19 16:16:37 did you add hover thrusters
help 2021-04-19 16:17:02 add them and if it doesnt work use the hover thrusters to trim pitch
help 2021-04-19 16:17:08 you just
help 2021-04-19 16:17:10 place them
help 2021-04-19 16:17:13 inside
help 2021-04-19 16:17:43 ok
help 2021-04-19 16:21:34 you can try to add space using motorlocks, if that doesnt work
help 2021-04-19 16:21:42 you need to align your rocket vertically to your CG
help 2021-04-19 16:21:48 or close to it
help 2021-04-19 16:22:09 you can add control surfaces as a last resort to control it
help 2021-04-19 16:22:33 just make sure it its farthest away from the CG if you're doing that
help 2021-04-19 16:22:38 or CL idk
help 2021-04-19 17:58:02 thats normal because of the way it spins
help 2021-04-19 17:58:07 you need a counterforce
help 2021-04-19 17:58:11 either by adding a tail rotor
help 2021-04-19 17:58:30 or a secondary counterclockwise or whatever opposite direction of the original rotor
help 2021-04-19 17:58:56 ur plane is broken
help 2021-04-19 17:59:50 ive never heard of it but your motors are misaligned
help 2021-04-19 17:59:57 its broken
help 2021-04-19 18:00:08 check for misaligned or motors that dont belong where they are
help 2021-04-19 18:00:27 ill draw brb
help 2021-04-19 18:00:51 im using a mouse so expect to look like bad lines
help 2021-04-19 18:03:04 
help 2021-04-19 18:03:22 i cant draw tail rotor from top down because its facing vertically
help 2021-04-19 18:03:52 this is why if you look at tail rotor failures in helicopters irl the heli start to spin
help 2021-04-19 18:04:21 another option is to make a counter rotating rotor on top of the main one
help 2021-04-19 18:04:47 it produces more lift but it almost virtually removes horizontal stability unless you have fins

help 2021-10-02 03:58:53 It’s illegal to use 1x1s instead of 4x1s when possible for block requirements right?
