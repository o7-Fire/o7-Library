The Tale of darmagon (311638025308209154)
creations-chat 2020-08-08 23:28:11 I am making a thing, anywhere that you guys think needs improvement?
creations-chat 2020-08-08 23:30:16 Here it is folded
creations-chat 2020-08-08 23:31:12 the outer layer and beginnings of the first floor of a large complex, from the second layer upwards a large turret will be installed
creations-chat 2020-08-09 00:15:52 Are people saying that WIP things cannot be placed in creations-chat?
creations-chat 2020-08-09 00:16:16 but it very clearly states in rules to put them there
creations-chat 2020-08-09 00:16:30 
creations-chat 2020-08-09 00:17:19 ok, just wanted to see clarification as I never saw an exclusive mention that <#384025409945337856> was being discussed
the-dump 2020-08-09 19:30:59 -4.2 frames
creations-chat 2020-08-09 20:02:13 Anybody got a better workaround for deuterium oxide than hh oxide? The sign filter is quite strict and even blocks out molecule names
creations-chat 2020-08-09 20:03:04 I don't wanna say heavy water because there's already a water pipe and that might get confusing
creations-chat 2020-08-09 20:03:36 literally any number gets instantly erased
creations-chat 2020-08-09 20:05:12 I don't think I've made a folding craft, might try that some day
creations-chat 2020-08-09 20:07:53 I understand the pain of painting ladders, my trick is to angle the camera and do it in groups of 1-2 or if you can, angle the camera so it's just without visible gaps and paint it like a wall
creations-chat 2020-08-09 20:08:58 this is a good angle for a straight ladder
creations-chat 2020-08-09 20:09:39 and yes it is yellow, that's because it's temporary until construction is finished
creations-chat 2020-08-09 20:09:50 it is a ladder btw
creations-chat 2020-08-09 20:15:16 when submitting a creation to <#384025409945337856> should I ensure it is a full screenshot or can I crop things like other plots out?
creations-chat 2020-08-09 20:16:16 ah whatever, here's the cropped, finding a better angle and taking a full
creations-chat 2020-08-09 20:18:00 I can assure you this is a public server and I am too broke to buy a single gamepass atm but I'll do a full
bug-reports 2020-08-09 20:58:55 Can't quite be too descriptive but it happens everywhere: Lights hate moving, rotating spotlights have random chance to get 'stuck' where a piece of the spotlight stays on an area passed over, any moving light with shadows (and possibly without) has a high chance of randomly turning off and sometimes gets stuck like the spotlight but the light doesn't copy itself, the glow just freezes in space.
creations-chat 2020-08-09 21:27:13 this is the least safe runway ever
creations-chat 2020-08-09 21:29:16 you have about 28 blocks to go from flying to stopped
creations-chat 2020-08-09 21:29:26 and the safety catch has not yet been installed
creations-chat 2020-08-09 21:46:00 Something has gone wrong.
creations-chat 2020-08-09 21:46:28 the game flung me, took off my head, and welded it back on upside down and backwards
creations-chat 2020-08-09 21:47:07 and forgot to return the eye

help 2020-08-12 00:06:41 I'd say if it's doing that on its own that's probably some physics intersections with something else
creations-chat 2020-08-12 00:11:37 I wonder what kind of things rickje makes
creations-chat 2020-08-12 00:11:43 searching chats
creations-chat 2020-08-12 00:21:45 I like this community, it's nice.
creations-chat 2020-08-12 00:23:57 Mechs are too cool for me to make properly
creations-chat 2020-08-12 00:24:56 I mean I made one, it was missing legs though
creations-chat 2020-08-12 00:26:15 this thing barely qualifies as a mech
creations-chat 2020-08-12 00:27:10 It's a manned vehicle that can punch stuff
creations-chat 2020-08-12 00:30:31 yeah, those pricks that don't even think about the fact that something you are making might be WIP and assume it's supposed to be missing half the front and proceed to call it bad drive me insane sometimes
creations-chat 2020-08-12 00:31:18 also what's with the sudden love for making siren head builds? I see them everywhere now
creations-chat 2020-08-12 00:32:43 If someone out of the blue insults my skill I usually just save my work and load this thing or my attempt at a mech
creations-chat 2020-08-12 00:33:29 something else as a break from my other things while shoving their words down their throat
creations-chat 2020-08-12 00:34:23 it's basically an improved non mech battle focused base
creations-chat 2020-08-12 00:34:59 my old outdated mech gets targeted and obliterated before it can even go through the startup checklist
creations-chat 2020-08-12 00:36:08 so far this is practically ram proof and any attempts at cutting through the walls leave a cutter filled hole too small to fit through
creations-chat 2020-08-12 00:36:59 additionally it will have non pvp abilities such as a parking garage and very short airstrip
creations-chat 2020-08-12 00:38:02 the plan is to bury many missile turrets inside the walls and have a main gun above it all
creations-chat 2020-08-12 00:38:31 aka: you are not getting in forcefully yet unharmed
creations-chat 2020-08-12 00:39:19 I'll stop talking about how I plan on beating up things that break in now.
creations-chat 2020-08-12 00:42:19 also, the level of detail is just me trying to draw attention away from the tactical stuff while being armor, also it's just fun to make
creations-chat 2020-08-12 00:43:30 it's 8:42 PM and I talk about as good as a kazoo sometimes when tired

the-dump 2020-08-12 00:55:21 Quite a mech, how specifically does it move? I've seen a lot of people just spam thrusters to move the feet but it appears there's too little space for that

creations-chat 2020-08-12 21:03:33 when you
creations-chat 2020-08-13 13:42:59 I made a thing!
creations-chat 2020-08-13 13:43:23 aka: I put a thing on a cart!
creations-chat 2020-08-13 13:44:32 it's technically an octocopter with an excessive all terrain system
creations-chat 2020-08-13 13:53:42 though the report system would need to return and it'd add to the horrible mess of code this game consists of, an image block would be nice, gives a lot more options at the cost of some people abusing it, maybe if you blacklist someone it hides their images.
creations-chat 2020-08-13 13:55:01 figuring out the format an-
creations-chat 2020-08-13 13:55:09 don't you need a rank to suggest?
creations-chat 2020-08-13 13:55:34 I very much do not have a rank but will try anyways
creations-chat 2020-08-13 14:03:01 alright how does this sound? I just want to check it before I make an irreversible submission, I could've missed a grammar error or something similar
creations-chat 2020-08-13 14:03:05 [Image (1x1/1x2/2x2/1x3/3x3)]
[Configurable]

A panel similar to a sign or text panel but displays a selected image, the library for such images may range from roblox decals (spawn platform decal, roblox square icon, etc...) to a custom library (upload custom decals) at the developers discretion.
creations-chat 2020-08-13 14:04:03 tl;dr - images, idk where from but images
creations-chat 2020-08-13 14:05:36 yay
creations-chat 2020-08-13 14:07:56 Rollercoaster tycoon 2 did it with a lightly moderated library
creations-chat 2020-08-13 14:08:47 ah yes, so basically allow everything no matter what
creations-chat 2020-08-13 14:09:40 like how one person I had seen was detailing a male reproductive organ yet according to the community that is allowed and if I don't like it I leave the server
creations-chat 2020-08-13 14:10:43 a flawless game without moderation is worse than a flawed one with moderation
creations-chat 2020-08-13 14:11:17 apologies
creations-chat 2020-08-13 14:11:25 I had not noticed reports was back online
creations-chat 2020-08-13 14:11:45 yay this game is enjoyable
creations-chat 2020-08-13 14:13:18 it's called being unranked
creations-chat 2020-08-13 14:14:14 great job polluting the player base then, just hate every new player for noticing flaws in a game
creations-chat 2020-08-13 14:15:30 bruh
creations-chat 2020-08-13 14:15:44 olind you very clearly took part in this hatred towards me
creations-chat 2020-08-13 14:16:22 the flaws are that I cannot stop people from putting nudes on a house
creations-chat 2020-08-13 14:16:53 especially now that I see reports is here but deactivated
creations-chat 2020-08-13 14:18:58 you see, the more players you keep shuffling around with the stupid "if you don't like the rule breakers then leave" the more players dislike the playerbase and the fewer innocent there are, the trolls stay and keep annoying people causing them to shuffle
creations-chat 2020-08-13 14:21:50 it was literally a single idea a single concept of one mind that I had thought would be neat and good for exponentially multiplying the capabilities of signs but for *unknown reasons* everyone assumes it is 100% a pornography printer
creations-chat 2020-08-13 14:24:22 I literally thought: "what if signs but better?" and came up with image panels, the suggestion of which the community approved of enough for someone else to copy it and apply it for me, if you dislike it don't bully me, just give a good reason I cannot easily counter and it is gone.
creations-chat 2020-08-13 14:25:24 then I have an alternative idea
creations-chat 2020-08-13 14:26:44 paint sheet
building

A panel that consists of 4 paintable squares on a 5th paintable thin block, about the thickness of a sign
creations-chat 2020-08-13 14:27:21 it's harder to do bad things with fewer pixels, it'll still happen but in lesser quantity as it requires effort
creations-chat 2020-08-13 14:28:00 I used paint blocks a while back while designing a plane
creations-chat 2020-08-13 14:28:33 1 block thick yet 6 paintable sides is beautiful for designing detailed interior and exterior while keeping mass low
creations-chat 2020-08-13 14:29:31 that's because of the 4 unpainted walls
creations-chat 2020-08-13 14:29:58 kinda wish paint blocks had the ability to preset color but again
creations-chat 2020-08-13 14:30:01 code is spaghet
creations-chat 2020-08-13 14:30:46 I still cannot wrap my head around the monumental tangle they describe it as
creations-chat 2020-08-13 14:31:06 did they at least section the individual blocks off?
creations-chat 2020-08-13 14:32:32 How do people put multiple images in one message?
creations-chat 2020-08-13 14:33:19 I've got 4 images and don't think they each deserve a vote system as they are all for the same vehicle
the-dump 2020-08-13 14:38:48 https://tenor.com/view/helitank-gif-14340016
the-dump 2020-08-13 14:39:14 I wonder if anybody actually made something like that
the-dump 2020-08-13 14:39:36 knowing the community someone very much did
creations-chat 2020-08-14 00:49:32 Why am I allowed to say deuterium oxide but not write it on a sign?
creations-chat 2020-08-14 00:50:21 *cries in sci fi reactor*
creations-chat 2020-08-14 00:51:33 bruh it doesn't even approve of dihydrogen monoxide
creations-chat 2020-08-14 00:51:42 literally the science words for **water**
bug-reports 2020-08-14 01:00:31 copy paste stops working on every window except Plane Crazy if copy paste is used for settings transfer
bug-reports 2020-08-14 01:05:55 I usually save my stuff and rejoin to get the ability back, sadly any special moments caught by screen snip cannot be caught as it actually blocks the copy to clipboard function
creations-chat 2020-08-14 03:57:16 I just had an idea: Chimera Laboratory on a mech
creations-chat 2020-08-14 03:57:36 you literally take different mech parts and weld them to eachother
creations-chat 2020-08-14 03:59:04 basically this but less horrifying
creations-chat 2020-08-14 04:00:36 and it can be applied to literally anything, a smart car with a locomotive engine, a plane spliced with a semi trailer
creations-chat 2020-08-14 04:01:22 rope bridge and boat dock
creations-chat 2020-08-14 04:01:41 you see
creations-chat 2020-08-14 04:01:50 you take the rope bridge though
creations-chat 2020-08-14 04:01:58 and you make it a boat dock
creations-chat 2020-08-14 04:02:52 office building and hamster wheel
creations-chat 2020-08-14 04:03:06 k
creations-chat 2020-08-14 04:04:44 I'm gonna try to take a copy of my octocopter and mix it with a plane to make some strange monodirectional heliplane thing
creations-chat 2020-08-14 05:36:58 alright
creations-chat 2020-08-14 05:38:02 because devs screwed up the code beyond repair and nobody feels like letting me recreate plane crazy after I learn programming I'm gonna create an in game fix
creations-chat 2020-08-14 05:38:49 My motto is "one way or another, it's gotta be done"
creations-chat 2020-08-14 05:38:58 so...
creations-chat 2020-08-14 05:41:14 current plan is to generate a stable bearing that can support the motor being in any position on a 5x5 cylinder
creations-chat 2020-08-14 05:41:27 but if that fails I'm gonna start learning programming
creations-chat 2020-08-14 05:42:15 well, if there's an actually active dev team and organized code then the suggestions list can be quickly completed
creations-chat 2020-08-14 05:43:16 first I'm gonna try to create a hyper compact motor lock BASED motor lock fix
creations-chat 2020-08-14 05:43:52 after all it's fine if motor lock is fixed breaking the thing as it was there to work around motor lock in the first place
creations-chat 2020-08-14 05:44:50 it's kind of funny
creations-chat 2020-08-14 05:45:33 either plane crazy
fixes motor lock
I find a compact solution
or
I rebuild plane crazy with a fix
creations-chat 2020-08-14 05:46:36 actually it seems like a lot of the community believes a complete rebuild is required so I might begin taking lessons even if I find a solution or plane crazy fixes
creations-chat 2020-08-14 05:48:14 starting testing
creations-chat 2020-08-14 05:52:26 test 01 confirms that the motor lock bug is present
creations-chat 2020-08-14 06:00:20 Candidate 01: Spring, 1x1, can be stretched beyond 1x1 position, continuing testing
creations-chat 2020-08-14 06:01:23 Candidate 01 failure, non locked motors are too weak to resist tension
creations-chat 2020-08-14 06:03:12 suspension has passed tension test, proceeding to next testing phase
creations-chat 2020-08-14 06:19:38 one moment
creations-chat 2020-08-14 06:20:53 first functional stability prototype
creations-chat 2020-08-14 06:21:09 compressing and field tests shortly
creations-chat 2020-08-14 06:31:47 It appears this is as compact as it gets with minimal risk of breaking if there happens to be a relock error
creations-chat 2020-08-14 06:32:57 red parts can be welded to eachother safely, blue parts are the output, and purple is mechanical and must be kept clear of
creations-chat 2020-08-14 06:46:42 compact partially enclosed unanchored debugged locked motor
creations-chat 2020-08-14 06:47:31 I could compress it exponentially more by destablizing it
creations-chat 2020-08-14 06:47:45 when a motor is set to locked it contracts
creations-chat 2020-08-14 06:48:12 I built a structure that completely removes that effect from the output
creations-chat 2020-08-14 06:49:11 so now you have a rotational point that ignores all outside forces when not in use that also does not have any glitchy side effects
creations-chat 2020-08-14 06:49:41 preforming load test
creations-chat 2020-08-14 06:50:39 no unintended effects shown from high torque application and stall
creations-chat 2020-08-14 06:50:53 well
creations-chat 2020-08-14 06:51:04 one was just found that is likely easy to counter
creations-chat 2020-08-14 06:51:24 when stressed the motor moves the housing perpetually
creations-chat 2020-08-14 06:53:00 was fixed with no side effects by applying grip material to the base
creations-chat 2020-08-14 06:54:12 ok that's a compact motor lock fix, I'll begin looking for programming lessons shortly, what language does roblox script use?
creations-chat 2020-08-14 06:55:49 dammit
creations-chat 2020-08-14 06:55:59 how similar is it to regular lua?
creations-chat 2020-08-14 07:00:49 nope
creations-chat 2020-08-14 07:01:02 just did some research and found lua is just very very configurable
creations-chat 2020-08-14 07:01:29 and as it is not object oriented they configured it to allow objects to exist
creations-chat 2020-08-14 07:01:45 if that is the meaning of object they are using
creations-chat 2020-08-14 07:02:15 so I'm learning code to hopefully some day design a similar game with a fixed motor lock
creations-chat 2020-08-14 07:02:42 yes
creations-chat 2020-08-14 07:04:53 alright then
creations-chat 2020-08-14 07:05:05 adding on to thing I was typing
creations-chat 2020-08-14 07:06:40 I have assembled a list
0: Preform 1, 3, and 4 with java script oriented version of 2
1: Learn basics
2: make some things in studio
3: learn advanced stuff
4: design a small scripted game
5: start working on a replacement for plane crazy
creations-chat 2020-08-14 07:08:03 assembling a coding hobby/subcareer backup plan in case my intended one fails in a special career server I will set up now
creations-chat 2020-08-14 07:08:30 this will literally take a chunk out of my life because I am too angry at plane crazy's poor coding
creations-chat 2020-08-14 07:09:14 but hey it's also organizing my life a whole lot better than the plane crazy scripts
creations-chat 2020-08-14 07:13:24 <@!311638025308209154> I pinged myself because nobody has mentioned me with intent to help
help 2020-08-14 09:12:40 I have read the rules and it appears there is a corresponding rank, am I missing a requirement or is a bot bugged or...?

creations-chat 2020-08-14 13:07:26 I got bored so I'm making attempt of an engine
creations-chat 2020-08-14 13:07:53 the push part will be at the bottom
creations-chat 2020-08-14 13:11:59 yes
creations-chat 2020-08-14 13:12:30 just freestyling, goal is something that at least produces fake rotation
creations-chat 2020-08-14 13:14:37 the interesting part is that the propelling force will come from the bottom and turn something at the top
creations-chat 2020-08-14 13:19:24 hmmmmmmmmm

creations-chat 2020-08-14 13:22:16 what sides of this motor connect to the light colored small rectangular prism
creations-chat 2020-08-14 13:23:52 yes

creations-chat 2020-08-14 13:25:01 > <@!311638025308209154> they need blood
Correct
creations-chat 2020-08-14 13:26:23 my solution is simple: be too defense to give them satisfaction, if they take 5 years to chew through a wall then they will get bored.
creations-chat 2020-08-14 13:27:18 I have a stationary base and it holds up damn well
creations-chat 2020-08-14 13:28:40 once they figure out that when anchored no parts will fall down satisfyingly they give up only having blown a small breach into the defenses
creations-chat 2020-08-14 13:37:52 getting there
creations-chat 2020-08-14 13:44:06 I built a thing
creations-chat 2020-08-14 13:44:45 the jet based power is so annoy to use so currently I am just using motor power
creations-chat 2020-08-14 14:06:54 I found a cool use for the thing
creations-chat 2020-08-14 14:07:04 as a pendulum drive for a wipeout course

creations-chat 2020-08-17 03:40:54 I wonder how many people will hate me if I say this
creations-chat 2020-08-17 03:41:20 but I use rgb values that are multiples of 25
creations-chat 2020-08-17 03:44:20 125 125 125 is a good light grey
creations-chat 2020-08-17 03:45:21 I use them in multiples of 25 so I can choose similar yet different shades of grey/gray
creations-chat 2020-08-17 03:51:14 I don't get why people are so amazed by a 1x8 wedge

creations-chat 2020-08-17 04:01:30 hmmmmmmm
creations-chat 2020-08-17 04:02:06 I'll just add engines and see if that helps

the-dump 2020-08-23 01:10:48 2: spawn in a rift generator
the-dump 2020-08-23 01:11:03 3: spawn in my least fun to destroy thing
the-dump 2020-08-23 01:11:26 4: do not spawn stuff
the-dump 2020-08-23 01:11:29 5: exit
the-dump 2020-08-23 01:11:42 the plan only advances a step if I get bored
the-dump 2020-08-23 01:12:02 or
the-dump 2020-08-23 01:12:04 ya know
the-dump 2020-08-23 01:12:12 anchored base
the-dump 2020-08-23 01:12:26 it takes minutes to chew through my walls
the-dump 2020-08-23 01:12:50 and no part of the walls will satisfy, only sting with embedded cutters
the-dump 2020-08-23 01:13:11 and then I freeze them in the wall
creations-chat 2020-08-25 04:07:08 Caution: Rather warm

creations-chat 2020-08-25 22:14:47 circles are strange in block based building games
creations-chat 2020-08-26 17:50:56 who else thinks cutters were not made well and should be remade to prefer repeated ramming instead of sawing?
creations-chat 2020-08-26 17:51:55 the only reason shredder bugs exist is because the knife block does not behave like a knife and more like a laser drill of absolute destruction

creations-chat 2020-08-29 02:42:06 WHERE
creations-chat 2020-08-29 02:42:21 I want to peel them.
creations-chat 2020-08-29 02:43:51 a funny counter is
creations-chat 2020-08-29 02:44:07 for a lot of my bases
creations-chat 2020-08-29 02:44:24 it's hard to tell when they are in build mode
creations-chat 2020-08-29 02:44:34 so they just KTHWACK against it
creations-chat 2020-08-29 02:45:17 question:
creations-chat 2020-08-29 02:45:28 how good are cutters against cutters?
creations-chat 2020-08-29 02:45:36 what determines damage?
creations-chat 2020-08-29 02:46:12 anchored cutters?
creations-chat 2020-08-29 02:46:44 I have

creations-chat 2020-08-29 02:48:15 angry sky not yet implemented
creations-chat 2020-08-29 02:48:25 but blacklist can fix that
creations-chat 2020-08-29 02:48:38 for now
creations-chat 2020-08-29 02:48:54 I want to avoid the easy built in no melee walls
creations-chat 2020-08-29 02:54:54 how strong is diamond plate?
creations-chat 2020-08-29 02:58:35 I just thought of a challenge that is completely stupid
creations-chat 2020-08-29 02:58:45 r o u n d
creations-chat 2020-08-29 02:58:59 you can only use blocks from the cylinder and ball category
creations-chat 2020-08-29 02:59:56 it gets worse if you try to make something with interiors tho

creations-chat 2020-08-29 03:33:21 I recently learned about "***the smoke pipe glitch***" and I am unimpressed.
creations-chat 2020-08-29 03:33:42 it's literally just getting the smoke pipe wedged between your head and torso

creations-chat 2020-08-29 03:34:59 please tell me that speaker does not do anything related to the theme of the tank
creations-chat 2020-08-29 18:33:00 if I were to choose how blocks are implemented
creations-chat 2020-08-29 18:33:36 you place the block in the appropriate class folder and the block holds its script
creations-chat 2020-08-29 18:34:15 when placed it clones the block into the build area, and on launch runs the script
creations-chat 2020-08-29 18:34:49 but
creations-chat 2020-08-29 18:35:02 do ballast tanks change mass when in air
creations-chat 2020-08-29 18:36:03 Idea
creations-chat 2020-08-29 18:37:07 helium pumptank, the first block that interacts with a specific other block, it controls the power of all helium within a set radius
creations-chat 2020-08-29 18:37:45 and why are we in creations chat?
creations-chat 2020-08-29 18:38:36 here's one of my fairly awesome ideas
creations-chat 2020-08-29 18:40:56 gun is a special connected block, it has 3 modes, standard, machinegun, or rifle, machinegun increases spread and decreases damage while multiplying fire rate for every gun added, rifle decreases spread, increases damage, decreases fire rate, and adds penetration for every gun added, standard has no effect for guns added
creations-chat 2020-08-29 18:41:47 I just had another cool idea
creations-chat 2020-08-29 18:42:00 artillery and artillery barrel
creations-chat 2020-08-29 18:42:33 artillery fires a REALLY BIG BULLET and the barrel controls range + accuracy

creations-chat 2020-08-30 00:11:40 painting hover thruster rings is so annoying
creations-chat 2020-08-30 00:12:40 I feel like the ring should be extended to a little cutout on the back of the thruster so you can reach them without shoving your camera into the thruster
creations-chat 2020-08-30 00:12:56 or better yet
creations-chat 2020-08-30 00:13:10 a small hole cut into the sides so you don't need access to the back

creations-chat 2020-08-30 20:28:46 there's the main hull zone with all the movement and gunness

creations-chat 2020-08-30 20:49:42 I use WSAD for all torpedo steering
creations-chat 2020-08-30 20:49:48 I detach one at a time
creations-chat 2020-08-30 20:56:18 it appears 6 directional magnet drive will work for the air torps
creations-chat 2020-08-30 20:58:47 Please relabel these to push and pull
creations-chat 2020-08-30 20:59:04 (forward pulls for some reason)
creations-chat 2020-08-30 21:05:51 because plane crazy dislikes my everything I will have to use horizontal rail launch torps

bug-reports 2020-08-31 21:14:26 fix rail junctions
bug-reports 2020-08-31 21:16:03 there is no excuse to use copy and paste junctions where absolutely none of them have the proper connected rails to smoothly function.
bug-reports 2020-08-31 21:18:09 you forgot to highlight this one where when you go around the turn and try to take the (in this case) above split, it is practically impossible to not derail
bug-reports 2020-08-31 21:18:22 to clarify
bug-reports 2020-08-31 21:19:14 1: go over top rail
2: take the very sharp 180 to the lower area

help 2020-09-04 08:05:37 I guess the game will die not by bugs but lack of moderation
help 2020-09-04 08:06:08 so basically
help 2020-09-04 08:07:05 "we won't do anything to try to fix the obvious problem so you need to keep switching servers every 10 seconds"
help 2020-09-04 08:08:54 Let's count the problems with the players that could be fixed with base level moderation and balance patches
cutter bugs
non pvp spinners
generic trolls
unreported exploiters
help 2020-09-04 08:10:18 shredder bugs are basically the #1 kill everything solution right now, if cutters were simply rebalanced then actually creative things could exist
help 2020-09-04 08:12:30 also
why the hell does this game even consider allowing exploiters? it's directly against the roblox TOS to the point that there's a specifically crafted option in the roblox report system

the-dump 2020-11-08 08:15:43 Ok so
the-dump 2020-11-08 08:15:51 Really psychological question here
the-dump 2020-11-08 08:16:16 If there is
True
And there is
False
the-dump 2020-11-08 08:16:52 Is a mixture of true and false, one or the other? both? neither? a new thing?
the-dump 2020-11-08 08:17:23 If one or the other then how far towards the opposite until it switches?
the-dump 2020-11-08 08:18:25 Or did I accidentally make another impossible question

bug-reports 2020-11-09 11:41:17 The game tends to randomly erase the anchored part of my creation
bug-reports 2020-11-09 11:42:47 Might have something to do with the shredders bouncing off it repeatedly
bug-reports 2020-11-09 11:43:01 but it just randomly gets erased
bug-reports 2020-11-09 11:43:08 some form of debris cleanup?
bug-reports 2020-11-09 11:43:47 I saw it vanish in sections, it was erased from top to bottom
bug-reports 2020-11-09 11:50:58 It doesn't lag when I reset, indicating the very inefficient script trying to unweld the anchored blocks is not unwelding anything, the blocks vanished
bug-reports 2020-11-09 11:51:17 not like pushed off the edge vanished because it still lags when that happens

the-dump 2020-11-12 00:05:55 Due to the collapse of the chain, I can stop finding leak points for today's meme list
the-dump 2020-11-12 00:06:05 Resuming normal activity
the-dump 2020-11-12 00:06:18 
the-dump 2020-11-12 00:07:33 Due to recent interruption the meme list was reconfigured, before undoing these changes I will install a small statement
the-dump 2020-11-12 00:12:08 In the event <#495286269459300364> is obstructed by a chain of which erases unrelated messages, we are physically unable to keep posts in <#495286269459300364>, this presents a very sensitive situation of which adds slack to the line of rule 4 of which, if utilized correctly, may completely dismantle the points of rule 4.
the-dump 2020-11-12 00:12:42 The loophole in this situation is how
the-dump 2020-11-12 00:13:07 We are instructed to move a material to a location
the-dump 2020-11-12 00:13:23 if that location is unavailable, we cannot follow that instruction
the-dump 2020-11-12 00:13:41 this instruction is tied to the entirety of the no memes rule
the-dump 2020-11-12 00:14:40 if manipulated correctly it may completely dissolve rule 4 whenever an appropriate message is deleted from <#495286269459300364>
the-dump 2020-11-12 00:15:36 Suggested action: Introduce a second dump chat, as a chain cannot bridge between chats this will completely seal the loophole
the-dump 2020-11-12 00:16:24 I'm discussing how if that chain continued for longer I may have stumbled upon a loop hole that allowed everyone to put things similar to memes everywhere

bug-reports 2020-11-15 09:46:51 > [BUG REPORT] Sometimes when I join a Plane Crazy server, when I build, **the blocks do not appear before I place them**, which makes building difficult since I’m rotating the object blindly. _[DEVICE INFO: iPhone 7 Plus with iOS 14.1, Roblox Version 2.455.413788.]_
Similar but probably known issue: When in first person build mode, both the block and helper arrow vanish, the green lines remain, odd issue...

bug-reports 2020-11-19 02:26:38 Anchored trapdoors cannot open or close.
bug-reports 2020-11-19 02:27:04 Might be useful but still important to point out
bug-reports 2020-11-19 02:28:41 The point of the anchor block being there is usually because it's attached to a large base
bug-reports 2020-11-19 02:30:09 I mean
bug-reports 2020-11-19 02:30:17 they find what they are attached to and anchor it
bug-reports 2020-11-19 02:30:47 but if motors are excluded, why doesn't the trapdoor, another rotating part, get excluded
bug-reports 2020-11-19 02:31:35 Unless it's because rickje decided to spaghetti and broke the concept of motors also getting anchored

bug-reports 2020-11-19 03:25:50 New option for anchor blocks "Unanchor on break or cutoff"
bug-reports 2020-11-19 03:27:38 Just occasionally asks blocks anchored by that anchor and no others "Am I attached to this anchor?" and if not, unanchor.
bug-reports 2020-11-19 03:29:38 If a block is anchored by multiple anchors, it goes down a list of connected anchors, once all are crossed off and damage was taken, pop
bug-reports 2020-11-19 03:30:09 Oh, also run the check whenever a disconnector activates
bug-reports 2020-11-19 03:31:40 Trying to come up with an optimized solution but I just find it annoying that my bases cannot be destroyed satisfyingly as the anchored sections like to stay anchored

the-dump 2020-11-19 19:42:58 Here's a delicious tutorial that I will probably never use: https://youtu.be/c3iVKTENKwA
the-dump 2020-11-19 19:43:20 Instantaneous downvote
the-dump 2020-11-19 19:43:38 is there a bot that auto downvotes the word tutorial
the-dump 2020-11-19 19:44:23 also, the chain was moving slower than a turtle glued to the floor of a cryogenic stasis pod
the-dump 2020-11-19 19:44:44 so a chain break wouldn't have started that
the-dump 2020-11-19 19:45:37 Here's a fun fact:
the-dump 2020-11-19 19:45:41 School is a tutorial
the-dump 2020-11-19 19:45:49 we all operate under a tutorial
the-dump 2020-11-19 19:47:00 so you just managed to manifest your knowledge of + - * / when you were young
the-dump 2020-11-19 19:48:03 Who made the hamburger
the-dump 2020-11-19 19:48:34 Then the reasonable conclusion is that a fast food employee made it
the-dump 2020-11-19 19:48:59 that employee likely went to a school to easily learn how to make that burger
the-dump 2020-11-19 19:49:22 thereby the burger was a modified tutorial creation
the-dump 2020-11-19 19:49:43 In the event that god made the burger
the-dump 2020-11-19 19:50:37 The initial quantum fluctuation that resulted in the big bang and thus our manifestation of a god
the-dump 2020-11-19 19:51:21 likely resulted from noise of previous universes or multiverse interference
the-dump 2020-11-19 19:51:53 thereby the total collective of noise generation assembles into a tutorial of how to start a universe
the-dump 2020-11-19 19:52:03 and everything is now a tutorial
the-dump 2020-11-19 19:52:13 including god which is the burger
the-dump 2020-11-19 19:52:55 And thus I have validated my reason to define a video as a tutorial
the-dump 2020-11-19 19:52:56 anyways

the-dump 2020-11-19 20:01:06 because you people are lazy and just want an excuse to yell at me because "haha tutorial bad"
the-dump 2020-11-19 20:01:15 let's do the fast version first
the-dump 2020-11-19 20:02:09 Anyways
the-dump 2020-11-19 20:02:23 subsidiary of PepsiCo.
the-dump 2020-11-19 20:02:36 pepsico was founded on a location on earth
the-dump 2020-11-19 20:03:09 earth was founded by the explosion of stars
the-dump 2020-11-19 20:03:28 stars were founded by the explosion of a singularity
the-dump 2020-11-19 20:03:54 this singularity formed the universe
the-dump 2020-11-19 20:04:13 see my previous explanation for how the universe was a tutorial
the-dump 2020-11-19 20:04:47 well
the-dump 2020-11-19 20:04:51 here's my reasoning
the-dump 2020-11-19 20:05:04 for the stars to exist the universe has to exist
the-dump 2020-11-19 20:05:16 with the big bang the universe was formed
the-dump 2020-11-19 20:06:45 to conclude: because the universe was a tutorial, doritos.

the-dump 2020-11-21 21:59:45 <@!454809803223465984> "And a downvote is feedback"
That's like saying "You suck" without a single reason, how is that real feedback
the-dump 2020-11-21 22:01:09 It just seems odd that you have the time to downvote but not the time to think of a reason why
the-dump 2020-11-21 22:04:27 Lmao
the-dump 2020-11-21 22:05:08 A lot of those were generic insults with no backing
the-dump 2020-11-21 22:05:51 There's repeats of insults
the-dump 2020-11-21 22:05:54 lmao
the-dump 2020-11-21 22:09:55 Should I not respond to someone saying "Here's 12 reasons as to why you suck and I hate you" and the creator didn't even put in the effort to make 12 reasons.
I'll say this: I can justify a few but invalidate a lot more of those reasons, my major trigger is people deciding to attempt to degrade others with no backing and I am fully ready to counter, additionally I must remind others that this argument on both my side and theirs is verging towards rule 1, so I'll stop now.
the-dump 2020-11-21 22:12:27 <:KEKW:670310537300672528>
the-dump 2020-11-21 22:13:39 Exactly the point I'm going for here, neither of us are in the right, because the feedback system encourages non-constructive criticism and making others provide the constructiveness later
the-dump 2020-11-21 22:15:05 This is the reason as to why most online purchase sites make you write a complaint before reviewing

the-dump 2020-11-26 00:23:02 To conclude: To avoid embarrassing yourself or risking a potential warn (Mods are nice so I doubt it) I recommend not sending the requested image.
the-dump 2020-11-26 00:24:06 Knowing the salt in this server and how aggressive some of the silent ones here are
the-dump 2020-11-26 00:24:22 For security reasons I output minimal information on areas i can be traced back to
the-dump 2020-11-26 00:24:51 if you for some reason believe you should take that photo I suggest covering up things that can identify key security information or location
the-dump 2020-11-26 00:26:39 My thoughts exactly, I've seen many people get doxxed in roblox groups such as this one
the-dump 2020-11-26 00:26:58 To the point that their location was sitting as a point on a map in an image on the main chat
the-dump 2020-11-26 00:29:27 [Information has been erased to minimize doxx activity]
the-dump 2020-11-26 00:31:20 I wonder if there's a drain on garbage trucks
the-dump 2020-11-26 00:31:58 Cause they have no reason to clean the inside of the truck
the-dump 2020-11-26 00:32:22 so your blood would probably sit at the floor of the truck for quite some time
the-dump 2020-11-26 00:35:47 **Once again, I do not condone the action of loading yourself into a garbage truck's compaction system, in this system there is very little chance of survival and the crushing plate of the vehicle will shatter your bone, do not load yourself into the compaction system of a garbage truck, in the event it is absolutely required then alert all staff, have the vehicle's ejection door open, empty the contents, and shut down the truck, engage all other safety mechanisms available, and enter with a plan to escape as quickly as possible should anything seem out of the ordinary.**

the-dump 2020-11-26 01:42:55 Seriously, who thinks "Oh these people are screaming and their lives are in danger, haha car funny"
the-dump 2020-11-26 01:44:06 Until the stresses applied to the bus cause it to break, considering how much force is being put on the front wheels those are likely to buckle first
the-dump 2020-11-26 01:44:26 and then they soar off the mountain into the rock pile below
the-dump 2020-11-26 01:45:04 Call it dark humor next time you find debris at the bottom of a cliffside road
the-dump 2020-11-26 01:46:51 Even if it all worked out, do you still find it ok that the passengers did not agree to this?
the-dump 2020-11-26 01:47:23 https://discordapp.com/channels/384021699466756103/495286269459300364/781332568116822066
the-dump 2020-11-26 01:47:44 I am not ok with torture and this is borderlining it
the-dump 2020-11-26 01:48:08 None of the passengers agreed to this as you can hear from the constant screams
the-dump 2020-11-26 01:48:36 People were yelling to pull the E brake and throw him off the seat
the-dump 2020-11-26 01:48:44 but they couldn't
the-dump 2020-11-26 01:49:51 Seeing as the level of concentration required, doing such a thing would cause the bus to crash
the-dump 2020-11-26 01:50:16 It's called choosing my words
the-dump 2020-11-26 01:50:41 Right now I'm very angry so I need to rewrite with a calm tone
the-dump 2020-11-26 01:51:55 The compounded effect of forcing the passengers into stress, the stop button risking potential crash, and the effects of such, creates a scenario almost similar to holding 24 people at gunpoint
the-dump 2020-11-26 01:52:43 Now
the-dump 2020-11-26 01:53:07 Explain why it is ok to do such an act as to unwillingly hold people so close to death
the-dump 2020-11-26 01:53:22 one slight of hand away from heaven
the-dump 2020-11-26 01:54:11 one could say that making a wrong turn is as simple and as deadly in that scenario as pulling a trigger
the-dump 2020-11-26 01:55:32 
the-dump 2020-11-26 01:56:07 "A chance of survival"
the-dump 2020-11-26 01:56:33 What if you were sitting in the front row of a bus and I told you that 2 flips of a coin could decide if you live or die
the-dump 2020-11-26 01:57:07 Would you just be ok with a "Chance of survival"
the-dump 2020-11-26 01:57:22 That changes the scenario
the-dump 2020-11-26 01:57:32 there's 24 revolvers pointed at 24 people
the-dump 2020-11-26 01:57:42 all are loaded with 2 bullets
the-dump 2020-11-26 01:57:52 spun to random position
the-dump 2020-11-26 01:58:28 Would you still be ok that at any moment one spin of a wheel could pull the trigger of every revolver?
the-dump 2020-11-26 01:59:04 In fact
the-dump 2020-11-26 01:59:13 I don't even need to specify an exact round count
the-dump 2020-11-26 01:59:28 for front to back the number varies from 1 to 5
the-dump 2020-11-26 02:00:06 Let's consider this across 2 comparative scenarios
the-dump 2020-11-26 02:00:23 You just boarded the bus with 24 other people
the-dump 2020-11-26 02:00:31 the driver parked normally
the-dump 2020-11-26 02:01:29 but as you started travelling through the forest, you noticed they were getting faster and faster, taking turns sharper than a professional racer
the-dump 2020-11-26 02:01:41 you did not sign up for some crazy rollercoaster
the-dump 2020-11-26 02:01:46 there are no safeties
the-dump 2020-11-26 02:02:15 they continue to accelerate, you plead to god to be kept safe
the-dump 2020-11-26 02:03:28 at any moment if they went off the road you've got a fair chance of death, possibly higher, possibly lower
the-dump 2020-11-26 02:03:51 Tell me then
the-dump 2020-11-26 02:04:28 if the point of the video isn't that the passengers are screaming, tell me why there are passengers, tell me why their every cry is captioned for the world's review
the-dump 2020-11-26 02:05:38 The one man who decided to record a video, risking their life to grab the evidence required to lock that person up
the-dump 2020-11-26 02:06:39 Witnesses alone cannot win a case
the-dump 2020-11-26 02:07:10 Reasonably you could tell a group of 24 people to randomly go after a bus driver
the-dump 2020-11-26 02:07:34 that bus looked to be an old model that didn't have a built in camera
the-dump 2020-11-26 02:08:42 That makes me suspect that this was some form of casual operation with the co driver filming
the-dump 2020-11-26 02:08:46 but then again
the-dump 2020-11-26 02:08:52 HOW THE HELL IS THIS FUCKING CASUAL
the-dump 2020-11-26 02:09:08 EXPLAIN TO ME WHY IT IS OK
the-dump 2020-11-26 02:10:22 But still
the-dump 2020-11-26 02:10:36 the recording of this event proves that it happens so often it can be caught on film
the-dump 2020-11-26 02:11:34 Indicating that this driver risks a group's life
the-dump 2020-11-26 02:11:42 even monthy
the-dump 2020-11-26 02:11:48 even yearly
the-dump 2020-11-26 02:11:52 it still wouldn't be ok
the-dump 2020-11-26 02:12:08 this passed the point of dark humor
the-dump 2020-11-26 02:12:11 this is law material
the-dump 2020-11-26 02:12:30 I'm gonna try to reverse search this and get as much info as I can on that driver
the-dump 2020-11-26 02:12:53 Ya see
the-dump 2020-11-26 02:13:02 the humor falls off when it is no longer funny
the-dump 2020-11-26 02:13:19 in this case it isn't funny for any mentally sane human
the-dump 2020-11-26 02:14:22 Tell me now
the-dump 2020-11-26 02:15:01 Moderation can I ask this person if I can DM them a case similar to the one far above
the-dump 2020-11-26 02:15:14 except they crash

the-dump 2020-11-26 02:28:33 Hey
the-dump 2020-11-26 02:28:46 as they said dark humor can be as bad as dead people

bot-central 2020-11-26 17:41:23 Mee6 was made in 2016?!
the-dump 2020-11-26 17:42:04 Hey fun fact
the-dump 2020-11-26 17:42:20 <@!159985870458322944> is 4 years old
the-dump 2020-11-26 17:45:15 https://tenor.com/view/nope-nope-button-meme-gif-14240793
the-dump 2020-11-26 17:46:18 
the-dump 2020-11-26 17:46:38 
the-dump 2020-11-26 17:46:59 jam
the-dump 2020-11-26 18:29:19 
the-dump 2020-11-26 18:30:03 
the-dump 2020-11-26 18:34:03 So people disagreed with the previous tank design being bad
the-dump 2020-11-26 18:34:06 what about this one
the-dump 2020-11-26 18:34:08 
the-dump 2020-11-26 18:36:54 Ok I don't even know what this is
the-dump 2020-11-26 18:37:00 good or bad
the-dump 2020-11-26 18:39:16 if I were to design a tank
the-dump 2020-11-26 18:39:54 First thing I'd investigate is the potential for a simple way to compress and hide it in the ground
the-dump 2020-11-26 18:40:11 a pre-placed tank ready for battle is always good
the-dump 2020-11-26 18:41:20 In games where people build tanks there's usually track tensioning
the-dump 2020-11-26 18:41:37 Let's first try to collapse the abrams into a cube
the-dump 2020-11-26 18:41:42 what would be required
the-dump 2020-11-26 18:42:30 Well the internals of the turret have crewspace and probably some area for recoil dampening, if that space was used to slide the barrel assembly back then the barrel is out of the question
the-dump 2020-11-26 18:43:18 Considering track tension systems we could probably shift the track wheels around and pull the tracks in a bit so that's done
the-dump 2020-11-26 18:44:43 Ex: Remove any wheels not visible between that bottom and top wheel, move the top down halfway and put it between the next top and bottom set
the-dump 2020-11-26 18:45:09 I'm trying to compress the abrams into a cube
the-dump 2020-11-26 18:45:45 Goal is
the-dump 2020-11-26 18:46:44 A tank rivaling the common tanks that prioritizes having as many configurations as possible while still being able to be easily hid underground
the-dump 2020-11-26 18:48:11 then let's work on minimizing friction at the driving point
the-dump 2020-11-26 18:48:31 Quite a lot of options
the-dump 2020-11-26 18:49:22 Tank tracks are similar to a deflated wheel, the difference being a load of wheels are required to keep it in the specific shape
the-dump 2020-11-26 18:50:02 Trying to find which is better
the-dump 2020-11-26 18:50:12 multiple medium size wheels
the-dump 2020-11-26 18:50:30 or tracks with a lot more small wheels
the-dump 2020-11-26 18:51:34 Considering the goal is to minimize friction and fuel consumption for the high mass, wheels should be the option
the-dump 2020-11-26 18:51:55 Ooh
the-dump 2020-11-26 18:52:26 Wheels could also let me compact them easily due to SOFT
the-dump 2020-11-26 18:54:28 For variability, I'm thinking 2 possible options
the-dump 2020-11-26 18:56:23 Dumb idea but
the-dump 2020-11-26 18:56:32 Prefire
the-dump 2020-11-26 18:57:39 if there's a screw like pattern in a high speed spinning barrel, and a static key in the center with a firing activator at some point in the middle
the-dump 2020-11-26 18:58:23 the key could move to various positions to guarantee optimal firing power
the-dump 2020-11-26 18:59:20 I say it's a dumb idea because it completely missed an even greater concept
the-dump 2020-11-26 18:59:49 with the variable ignition point, you could make the shell effectively double jump through the barrel
creations-chat 2020-11-26 19:09:38 Mechs mainly exist with the purpose of power, not defense
creations-chat 2020-11-26 19:11:24 You wanna take this cargo container size thing from the top of this building and place it under a bridge? The mech can do that in a minimum of 15 seconds, much faster than the building to a tower crane to a truck to a loader to the bridge
Mechs are typically a mixture of a tank, legs, a crane, a loader, a forklift, and many other pieces of utility.
creations-chat 2020-11-26 19:13:17 (At the cost of being quite literally the largest active target available)
creations-chat 2020-11-26 19:14:58 Exosuits (aka: tiny mechs) are much more effective as they simply boost the armor, carrying capacity, endurance, and general strength of the wearer, allowing for things like wielding a minigun in battle
Sadly this is plane crazy not exosuit crazy so those aren't exactly possible

the-dump 2020-12-01 12:39:43 Though I understand it is a joke I'd advise against telling people to make mustard gas.
the-dump 2020-12-01 12:40:39 Well
the-dump 2020-12-01 12:40:43 very close to it
the-dump 2020-12-01 12:40:52 you will still die
the-dump 2020-12-01 12:41:06 in a similarly painful way
the-dump 2020-12-01 12:41:45 having your lungs disintegrate is usually quite bad
the-dump 2020-12-01 12:41:59 however
the-dump 2020-12-01 12:42:17 applying urine to the mixture also introduces mustard gas
the-dump 2020-12-01 12:43:28 
the-dump 2020-12-01 12:43:55 So now both your skin and lungs are being eroded
the-dump 2020-12-01 12:44:07 and eyes
the-dump 2020-12-01 12:44:09 and nose
the-dump 2020-12-01 12:44:13 and everywhere
the-dump 2020-12-01 12:44:47 actually I think it might even erode some objects
the-dump 2020-12-01 12:46:43 also I would recommend applying urine by
the-dump 2020-12-01 12:46:48 1: adding it to a container
the-dump 2020-12-01 12:47:06 2: attaching container to bleach container
the-dump 2020-12-01 12:47:12 3: releasing divide
the-dump 2020-12-01 12:48:09 "Health dangers. But chlorine itself is very reactive with the human body and very toxic. It irritates the eyes and skin and, even at quite low levels, can causes permanent lung damage even if it does not kill you.

the-dump 2020-12-18 03:25:42 I can't remember
the-dump 2020-12-18 03:26:11 Is that demon the one who breaks your knees to ensure you stay with them
the-dump 2020-12-18 03:26:20 or the other one
the-dump 2020-12-18 03:59:08 I've discovered a loophole
the-dump 2020-12-18 03:59:17 Though specifying earth seconds
the-dump 2020-12-18 03:59:47 it does not specify earth seconds relative to time elapsed from your perspective
the-dump 2020-12-18 04:00:03 so I could fall into a black hole and never have those 10 seconds pass
the-dump 2020-12-18 04:00:19 k
the-dump 2020-12-18 04:01:31 Well that was boring
the-dump 2020-12-18 04:08:14 
the-dump 2020-12-18 04:09:56 An extension to this is that if you are aware of a furry and have not attacked them during beat a furry day, you accept their presence in this world and consider them a friend
the-dump 2020-12-18 04:10:45 You are aware that then you will need to sit around with a corpse for 12 hours right?
the-dump 2020-12-18 04:11:06 and once again
the-dump 2020-12-18 04:11:25 the furry related action must be on your side
the-dump 2020-12-18 04:11:34 and be done in their proximity
the-dump 2020-12-18 04:12:46 So you must do a furry related action within proximity of the furry regardless of their condition
the-dump 2020-12-18 04:13:12 Do not remind me of him
the-dump 2020-12-18 04:14:59 All I can say without risking warn is

the-dump 2020-12-18 04:41:22 The timer image
the-dump 2020-12-18 04:41:38 is vulnerable to cards
the-dump 2020-12-18 04:42:19 So be ready to ping yourself if you try that crap again
the-dump 2020-12-18 04:43:12 Then again cards are vulnerable to cards so also be prepared for a reverse chain fighting under a timer
the-dump 2020-12-18 04:49:05 Tell me

the-dump 2020-12-18 04:49:36 Are those vertical cylinders on the truck or on the ground
the-dump 2020-12-18 04:52:54 Sadly, those two workers suffered severe injuries
the-dump 2020-12-18 04:53:08 they tried to defrost a valve with a blowtorch
the-dump 2020-12-18 04:53:22 not accounting that the empty truck may have fuel vapors left inside

the-dump 2020-12-20 02:28:15 starting off with simple tricks

the-dump 2020-12-20 02:31:07 
the-dump 2020-12-20 02:31:23 These do not symbolize objects, rather variables to identify
the-dump 2020-12-20 02:32:16 This gets confusing after around the 8th step
the-dump 2020-12-20 02:32:41 
the-dump 2020-12-20 02:32:51 
the-dump 2020-12-20 02:34:00 May as well start forcing you to do everyone's taxes too

the-dump 2020-12-20 03:36:22 hehe
the-dump 2020-12-20 04:51:47 
the-dump 2020-12-20 04:52:26 Hmm
the-dump 2020-12-20 09:05:37 Be advised
the-dump 2020-12-20 09:05:48 Fur day is now in effect
the-dump 2020-12-20 09:12:41 
the-dump 2020-12-20 09:12:56 
the-dump 2020-12-20 09:53:02 If any were curious as to why I was sealing loopholes in fur day
the-dump 2020-12-20 09:53:07 one simple reason
the-dump 2020-12-20 09:53:12 I don't got friends
the-dump 2020-12-20 09:53:25 0% chance of furry involvement
the-dump 2020-12-20 09:54:08 The event is designed around giving the introverted something to feel good about
the-dump 2020-12-20 09:54:58 Hm
the-dump 2020-12-20 09:55:17 Another loophole I will keep open is
the-dump 2020-12-20 09:55:26 you don't need to participate if you are the furry
the-dump 2020-12-20 10:24:13 I never got that
the-dump 2020-12-20 10:24:28 What is the problem with linking them parallel
the-dump 2020-12-20 10:24:51 too much power?

the-dump 2020-12-21 16:04:51 make non vaccine compliance result in continuous fines, then CPS and jail, in the event that they wish to become a biohazard by not vaccinating themselves then death penalty may be applied

the-dump 2020-12-21 18:07:44 Theoretically it can be classified as malicious but as it is harmless as long as it is not played
the-dump 2020-12-21 18:08:54 Note: Don't try to be a daredevil by starting and stopping the video, as long as the play button is clicked your client will freeze

the-dump 2020-12-21 18:16:26 The following messages will contain multiple redacted sections marked with a reference to "[unspecified]" instead.
the-dump 2020-12-21 18:18:26 It is very difficult to write a message about why the video will crash [unspecified] it is played on
the-dump 2020-12-21 18:22:06 The major function that breaks unprotected [unspecified] is the [unspecified], [unspecified] an effective infinite number of times at once near the end of [unspecified]. This presents a major flaw in many security systems as almost none have a defense against [unspecified] based attack, all it needs is an attached plan.
the-dump 2020-12-21 18:23:01 Good, this minimizes chances that you can recreate such an attack
the-dump 2020-12-21 18:25:50 To those who hold the words to fill in what I have redacted, please refrain from distributing it, the worst case scenario is that many duplicates are made and a surge of client crashing [unspecified] completely kills off trust of [unspecified] on discord until a patch is made.
the-dump 2020-12-21 18:27:17 It is my absolute priority to distribute warning without distributing means of creation, modification, or improvement

bug-reports 2020-12-24 02:12:09 Copy and paste does not properly copy recently changed settings
Steps to reproduce error
1: Place 2 Signs or text blocks (Recommend of same type to minimize variables)
2: Change text of first sign (Recommend "Old text A") and close the settings menu
3: Change text of second sign (Recommend "Old text B") and close the settings menu
4: Change text of first sign (Recommend "New text A") and **do not** close the settings menu
5: Press C (**Not** Ctrl+C, though it has similar effect it will break your ability to copy paste anything inside or outside roblox until you leave the game) (Without exiting the settings menu) to copy settings
6: Close settings menu and configure the second sign
7: Press V (**Not** Ctrl+V, effects untested, likely to break copy paste on your device similar to above note on Ctrl+C) to paste settings
8: Sign B should now read the text created before sign A was edited the second time (Recommended should result in "Old text A")

the-dump 2020-12-26 03:09:25 basically
the-dump 2020-12-26 03:10:27 I think the odd thing is how it transitions between near perfect orthographic and perspective
the-dump 2020-12-26 03:10:47 like someone tried to fake orthographic by taking a stupidly zoomed in photo
the-dump 2020-12-26 03:13:58 To me it feels like
the-dump 2020-12-26 03:14:12 some sorta
the-dump 2020-12-26 03:14:21 semiorthograph
the-dump 2020-12-26 03:14:52 like if you imitated ortho with low fov perspective and being really far away
the-dump 2020-12-26 03:16:15 but the ortho was created because at close with normal it appears stretched
the-dump 2020-12-26 03:17:02 like if someone took a really fucked up kitchen display and tried to make it look normal with camera position and angle
the-dump 2020-12-26 03:21:16 Basically
the-dump 2020-12-26 03:21:33 if you like seeing things use perspective
the-dump 2020-12-26 03:21:53 if you like making things using 4 different cameras use orthographic

the-dump 2021-01-02 17:07:51 The hate of furries has died aggressively
the-dump 2021-01-02 17:08:04 the source of the reason to hate was satire
the-dump 2021-01-02 17:08:10 It's just individuals
the-dump 2021-01-02 17:09:12 There's a difference between furries and zoophiles in case you didn't get the memo too
the-dump 2021-01-02 17:16:04 According to theories based on the current state of evolution and man's best friend
the-dump 2021-01-02 17:16:29 it is physically impossible to extract furries from humanity without killing every dog
the-dump 2021-01-02 17:17:24 So either deal with it or continue wasting time yelling, they aint' going anywhere
the-dump 2021-01-02 17:18:51 Actually there were
the-dump 2021-01-02 17:19:12 Technically you could even say there were furries in the Egyptian eras
the-dump 2021-01-02 17:20:00 As long as we can let other creatures into our living space there will be a constant inflow of furry psychology
the-dump 2021-01-02 17:20:40 And if you disagree with me then how about I start defending anime instead

the-dump 2021-01-31 01:14:19 This is one of many ways that you can tell such a 'video' is fake

the-dump 2021-01-31 03:27:53 But why is bob is ban
the-dump 2021-01-31 03:30:56 It is never a good idea to make a ban system where indefinite bans are non appeal-able at least the first
the-dump 2021-01-31 03:32:38 Even then I've been conceiving an idea where a group on a server can work together to appeal for someone
the-dump 2021-01-31 03:33:16 A good solution to keep public outcry to a minimum without having to completely murder a server

the-dump 2021-02-08 15:41:35 Birdwatching, or birding, is a form of wildlife observation in which the observation of birds is a recreational activity or citizen science. It can be done with the naked eye, through a visual enhancement device like binoculars and telescopes, by listening for bird sounds, or by watching public webcams.

Birdwatching often involves a significant auditory component, as many bird species are more easily detected and identified by ear than by eye. Most birdwatchers pursue this activity for recreational or social reasons, unlike ornithologists, who engage in the study of birds using formal scientific methods.
the-dump 2021-02-08 15:43:06 The early interest in observing birds for their aesthetic rather than utilitarian (mainly food) value is traced to the late 18th century in the works of Gilbert White, Thomas Bewick, George Montagu and John Clare. The study of birds and natural history in general became increasingly prevalent in Britain during the Victorian Era, often associated with collection, eggs and later skins being the artifacts of interest. Wealthy collectors made use of their contacts in the colonies to obtain specimens from around the world. It was only in the late 19th century that the call for bird protection began leading to the rising popularity of observations on living birds. The Audubon Society was started to protect brids from the growing trade in feathers in the United States while the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds began in Britain.

the-dump 2021-02-08 18:00:11 Spot the difference
the-dump 2021-02-08 18:00:48 Tip: look at the gap between grenade and spoon for both samples
the-dump 2021-02-08 18:02:47 I mean if you control breathing correctly you could at least kill the flame
the-dump 2021-02-08 18:03:12 if co2 proof then use pressure to eject from mouth
the-dump 2021-02-08 18:03:44 If forced in place then use pressure to force mouth open enough to release
the-dump 2021-02-08 18:04:59 If sealed then
A: Control pressure in timed release through nose, will likely fry mouth before burns out but will kill grenade
the-dump 2021-02-08 18:05:41 B: Sacrifice
the-dump 2021-02-08 18:06:21 it will destroy majority of mouth skin in process but unless your skin is stronger than a grenade body or superglue then its the only plan B
the-dump 2021-02-08 18:06:47 If arms are free then find glue release asap while following plan A

the-dump 2021-02-16 05:33:56 Subtraction is only to be performed for rank evaluation
the-dump 2021-02-16 05:34:04 upvotes count how many people like your stuff
the-dump 2021-02-16 05:34:21 you don't lose people liking stuff if someone dislikes it
the-dump 2021-02-16 05:36:23 In terms of the average degree of movement it does work
the-dump 2021-02-16 05:36:39 in terms of how many people like it enough to upvote you use upvotes
the-dump 2021-02-16 05:37:23 average degree of movements is by how much does it inspire people to hit one arrow over the other, if you have a very mild creation you will get fewer upvotes but also fewer downvotes
the-dump 2021-02-16 05:38:08 I say instead of raising thresholds, make it ratio based
the-dump 2021-02-16 05:39:36 If 25 people upvote, that's 25 people saying "This person deserves a reward for what they've created"
the-dump 2021-02-16 05:40:27 If 25 downvote that's 25 people saying "This contraption is below average in quality"
the-dump 2021-02-16 05:41:26 If 25 upvote but 25 downvote, that shouldn't be equal to an unnoticed submission
the-dump 2021-02-16 05:42:33 it means that 50% of people were moved enough by it to help decide its course
the-dump 2021-02-16 05:42:44 or rather
the-dump 2021-02-16 05:42:45 rewording
the-dump 2021-02-16 05:43:24 it means that lets say 100 people looked at it, half said "meh, its ok" and moved on
the-dump 2021-02-16 05:43:48 but 50 people said "I want to change the course of this submission"
the-dump 2021-02-16 05:45:45 One of my ideas was
the-dump 2021-02-16 05:45:55 once a set number of people have voted at all
the-dump 2021-02-16 05:46:05 it checks a ratio
the-dump 2021-02-16 05:47:54 Once the balance tips enough and is held there its position is locked
the-dump 2021-02-16 05:48:35 if it tipped > a set % then a set number of rank points are given
the-dump 2021-02-16 05:49:54 Once the balance has locked there's no need to look at it anymore
the-dump 2021-02-16 05:50:06 if you really need processing power then lock things older than 1 month
the-dump 2021-02-16 05:50:37 not like you need a 120 fps live feed on the balance
the-dump 2021-02-16 05:51:21 Did you not hear me when I said it requires a set number of collective votes to start checking
the-dump 2021-02-16 05:52:06 the locking is a side effect
the-dump 2021-02-16 05:52:48 Once again
the-dump 2021-02-16 05:52:52 this is the first prototype
the-dump 2021-02-16 05:53:24 Once again
the-dump 2021-02-16 05:53:28 this is the first prototype

the-dump 2021-02-16 05:53:52 this is the first prototype
the-dump 2021-02-16 05:54:17 The initial design was to create an anti cheat system
the-dump 2021-02-16 05:54:31 to prevent exploiting of the server's obvious design flaws
the-dump 2021-02-16 05:55:04 The secondary system however
the-dump 2021-02-16 05:55:24 rather than the excessive processing needed to get into hof
the-dump 2021-02-16 05:55:43 a simple "most popular of this week" page
the-dump 2021-02-16 05:56:12 attracted the most attention, got the most collective votes
the-dump 2021-02-16 05:56:17 upvotes + downvotes
the-dump 2021-02-16 05:57:17 Prob not gonna exactly give expert roles outta a popularity graph but its simple
the-dump 2021-02-16 05:58:14 at the end of the week hyperbot looks at the reaction counter for messages sent after the start of the week
the-dump 2021-02-16 05:58:29 easy to do too
the-dump 2021-02-16 05:58:54 I mean if you want you could get a special account running similarly to a bot

the-dump 2021-02-25 15:13:38 maybe full blocks actually
the-dump 2021-02-25 15:14:18 and then there's the fine pixel ones that consist of around an 8x8 grid that you can paint

the-dump 2021-03-09 13:25:35 Water constantly tries to regenerate from all directions but never in the middle of nowhere
the-dump 2021-03-09 13:26:24 End result is having no water in boats nor submarines

the-dump 2021-03-19 19:24:52 I'd like to note the google scorpion emoji

the-dump 2021-03-20 02:50:33 This also implies that dutch is poob
the-dump 2021-03-20 02:52:20 Would provide video but a video of a bee spinning its stinger out of someone's skin is probably classified as med-light nsfw
the-dump 2021-03-20 02:54:43 Also btw the sting juice pump tends to fall off with the stinger and will continue to try and pump
the-dump 2021-03-20 02:55:02 so it is good idea to remove stinger fast
the-dump 2021-03-20 02:58:11 Well its a barbed needle that needs to twist out of a human
the-dump 2021-03-20 02:58:24 Some people dislike needles and this would not help
the-dump 2021-03-20 02:59:46 I got shots monthly for about 4 years so I'm ok with needles but nobody is ok with random stings (except beekeepers)
the-dump 2021-03-20 03:00:44 I got stung when grabbing a fence, there was a bee/wasp on opposite side and finger was placed directly on
the-dump 2021-03-20 03:01:22 A way to describe it is that
the-dump 2021-03-20 03:01:31 spray on cut cleaning stuff
the-dump 2021-03-20 03:01:43 but the cutting item is coated
the-dump 2021-03-20 03:02:28 This stuff
the-dump 2021-03-20 03:02:55 There's a dead wasp nest outside window view from computer
the-dump 2021-03-20 03:03:13 Was sprayed and then entry tunnel smashed

the-dump 2021-03-21 23:48:31 Like setting a fuel silo on fire
the-dump 2021-03-22 03:17:03 Fun fact:
the-dump 2021-03-22 17:05:00 This means that according to them
the-dump 2021-03-22 17:05:45 If "You are what you eat" They must be vegetarian to not be furry
the-dump 2021-03-22 17:06:57 My defining system for what is furry:
the-dump 2021-03-22 17:07:31 Does not naturally have fur but obtained it through artificial means
the-dump 2021-03-22 17:07:58 Yes
the-dump 2021-03-22 17:08:11 Andre is the person that thinks a fox is a furry
the-dump 2021-03-22 17:08:16 For whatever reason
the-dump 2021-03-22 17:09:55 My defining system for at what point I am not ok with it:
Believes that the artificial fur is a part of them
or
Gets weird with it
the-dump 2021-03-22 17:10:13 Animal nice
the-dump 2021-03-22 17:11:26 Furry ok
Weirdness furries not ok
the-dump 2021-03-22 17:12:37 My interest in them is solely due to their tech
the-dump 2021-03-22 17:13:18 I predict in at most 500 years body modifications might start rolling out simply due to pull towards changing themselves
the-dump 2021-03-22 17:14:59 Like all it takes is a somewhat science orientated furry group forming an organization and that'd drive my estimations to around
the-dump 2021-03-22 17:15:13 90% chance for them to lead biomechanicals
the-dump 2021-03-22 17:15:29 Boop detection
the-dump 2021-03-22 17:16:13 My plans in that department are more internal
the-dump 2021-03-22 17:16:58 Turbines in blood vessels to create a consistently charging personal power bank at the cost of blood pressure changes
the-dump 2021-03-22 17:17:44 Yes but once the tech is out there it'll cascade quite violently
the-dump 2021-03-22 17:18:49 My goal is simply
the-dump 2021-03-22 17:19:15 create a way to use body to create energy without parking you on a bike or forcing you to jump and stuff
the-dump 2021-03-22 17:20:52 Way to think about it is
the-dump 2021-03-22 17:21:13 Mana but less fun

the-dump 2021-04-21 01:51:09 __**And as a counter to the tldr counter,**__ 1: isn't that a sin, 2: no matter what this always places you at a lower position in the world than that of the messenger and I'm basically on rock bottom, as another counter to the "who asked" I must clarify that this message is an answer to any future questions, yes this is the format of a prompted Q/A list

the-dump 2021-05-08 05:01:21 do you remember this video clip
of our robots working together using our
superior motion control?
the-dump 2021-05-08 05:01:45 If we didn't
impress you with that clip how about
this:
the-dump 2021-05-08 05:02:06 what do you say have you ever seen an
industrial robot moving with such
outstanding motion control as you can
see we've added another robot we've also
tightened up the tolerances
the distance between the cans and the
pin has been reduced to an impressive 1
millimeter and this isn't the limit of
the robot path accuracy it's the way the
cans are mounted on the tray how do we
get this fantastic motion by hours of
programming no way just program a path
of combined straight lines and circles
at normal slow programming speed
note the three robots moving together
when the programmer uses the joystick on
the teach pendant then run the program
in automatic mode up to full speed this
is our strength the path is speed
independent we show this by using the
manual speed control it's the same
program running no tuning needed what
your program is what you get
true mood for the best-in-class path
accuracy quick mood for the shortest
cycle times and you know what it's
delivered in all our robots as standard
superior motion control

help 2021-05-24 13:09:42 I get fps problems when using pistons to slide half blocks past one another and can fix this by using half wedges, try reducing the contact points of the folds

the-dump 2021-07-06 11:00:54 and that survival I'm counting wasn't even a commercial turbine that was a fighter jet but their clothes got caught in the intake before they made contact with it

creations-chat 2021-08-07 07:45:55 Why do you use blocky wheels
I used to use the 5x5 for a land transport for a drone and it shook so bad that it was hard to steer
And that was with 4 per side, how does a tank with 3 per side and rougher wheels even go straight?

creations-chat 2021-08-13 20:21:14 To get a good score in <#384025409945337856> you must design something that meets one of the following:
Achieves a record (Speed, Least of X, Most Y carried without hindering Z)
Looks really cool (Many ways to achieve this)
Looks very accurate to something
Has an absurd amount of motor lock (The use of motors with lock enabled to place blocks in places they usually are not allowed in)
Good photography (Don't just put 5% of the creation in frame)
Meme (May result in warn)
Misc (The people of PCC are weird and may randomly upvote something)

the-dump 2021-08-17 00:47:19 means that a wink is covered even a tiny bit by another wink. You can, however, play the top wink of any pile if it is yours and follow through to any wink directly under it.[6] [7]
the-dump 2021-08-17 00:47:42 - If someone pots out, the time limit no longer matters. The game continues until all winks of a partnership are in the pot. All squops must be squidged. Covering winks are moved to 2mm away from all other winks. Play continues in the regular order. First color to pot out wins.
the-dump 2021-08-17 00:48:01 - To play a squopped wink, you first play the upper surface of the unsquopped wink. Winks vertically below the wink you first touch can be hit by the squidger. The shot has to be short and continuous from start to finish. You could play a pile shot in which you send the enemy wink far away. This is called a boondock.

the-dump 2021-08-20 02:47:27 currently shredders are getting away with cutting things with the handle of a knife, when in reality it should do nothing
the-dump 2021-08-20 02:48:00 the point where it would do damage is when the cutter tip is driven directly into a block
the-dump 2021-08-20 02:48:37 best way to represent the cutter being driven into the block is to have multiple colliders
the-dump 2021-08-20 02:52:05 When traveling slowly, the left hitbox is used, a bump and some light damage, when traveling quickly, the right hitbox is used, if both prongs (extended for demonstration) are passed through before hitting the trapezoid then maximum damage will be given

the-dump 2021-08-22 12:17:33 This image is confusing me
the-dump 2021-08-22 12:30:53 Stupid idea I typed up for no reason and won't suggest because it needs more refinement and dedication than I have rn:
the-dump 2021-08-22 12:30:58 Fuel mode: [Required/Partial/Boost/None]
Required: Fuel is necessary to be able to send signals to your creation
Partial: Fuel is necessary to operate specific blocks such as propellers
Boost: Fuel is necessary to operate your creation at the highest possible level, it may operate slower without
None: Fuel has no effect on the craft, no performance boost, fuel tanks do not explode
the-dump 2021-08-22 12:31:38 
the-dump 2021-08-22 13:35:26 Hmm
the-dump 2021-08-22 13:35:46 Idea: Fuel blocks destroyed by explosives have a sort of "blast wave" effect
the-dump 2021-08-22 13:42:35 If an explosive block is next to a fuel block (on spawn, not when motorlocked together) its range is increased
the-dump 2021-08-22 13:43:39 an explosive can link to fuel in this range
the-dump 2021-08-22 13:43:54 fuel can only link to one explosive per block
the-dump 2021-08-22 13:44:20 fuel beams can link if 50% is in the link range
the-dump 2021-08-22 13:45:37 that should keep the '''realistic''' bomb makers happy
the-dump 2021-08-22 13:47:06 and technically it follows the same construction of a common nuke, a bunch of conventional explosives surrounding a core that combined create an intense explosion
the-dump 2021-08-22 13:47:20 and now the segment people get unhappy about
the-dump 2021-08-22 13:47:22 balance
the-dump 2021-08-22 13:48:54 to prevent you from spamming this, there is an arming period of between 15 and 120 seconds depending on power
the-dump 2021-08-22 13:50:23 this arming time is multiplied exponentially by how many modified explosives are present on the creation, so 16 max nukes takes an hour to arm, but 2 takes 3 minutes

the-dump 2021-08-24 11:40:00 And this is why pranks are not to be used as jokes, but attacks. Do not attempt to deceive someone with something seemingly very positive or negative as they may act upon that front.
the-dump 2021-08-24 11:41:39 Because it appeared to be the best thing that ever happened in their life according to their happiness, assuming the best.
the-dump 2021-08-24 11:42:31 Because you experienced the best moment of your life, perhaps held some resentment towards the old phone.
the-dump 2021-08-24 11:42:58 person likely gives no fucks
the-dump 2021-08-24 11:43:27 except the many examples where people died or got severely injured
the-dump 2021-08-24 11:44:20 
the-dump 2021-08-24 11:45:29 I've got 8 more examples of deaths and many more of injuries
the-dump 2021-08-24 11:46:45 most of which are not a clean death either
the-dump 2021-08-24 11:47:55 people suffered during their last moments, regretting their actions, or regretting the actions of others
the-dump 2021-08-24 11:49:28 To conclude, when preparing a prank against someone you do not fully understand, prepare for anything including death.
the-dump 2021-08-24 11:50:47 Well some people are inaccessible during the prank too
the-dump 2021-08-24 11:51:53 8th example a person committed suicide after being convinced that another person had when in fact they were perfectly fine.
the-dump 2021-08-24 11:53:51 the second example shows that it doesn't even need to be that intense of a prank
the-dump 2021-08-24 11:56:16 a █████ and friends were egging a random house, the ████ had died due to gunshot wounds
the-dump 2021-08-24 11:56:53 Someone had the idea of trying to claim that pranks were ok because they're "mostly" harmless
the-dump 2021-08-24 11:57:38 and Russian Roulette only has a 1 in 6 chance of killing you
the-dump 2021-08-24 11:58:30 the people that didn't die all did things on a similar level to the 2nd instance except got lucky
the-dump 2021-08-24 11:59:21 each time a negative action real or fake is performed against someone you are asking the question "are you willing to retaliate?"
the-dump 2021-08-24 12:01:00 How bout the legal
the-dump 2021-08-24 12:01:41 The law system has a way of handling idiots trying to be the "greatest pranksters"

the-dump 2021-08-25 19:13:53 1: Manage giveaway on trusted site
2: Legitimately execute giveaway
3: Robux must be distributed legally and must pass through official sites into the other account
the-dump 2021-08-25 19:15:03 The best way to complete #3 is to send a gift card
the-dump 2021-08-25 19:16:34 Sniper fails to completely neutralize threats
the-dump 2021-08-25 19:17:15 If changed furry dies they don't just become harmless goo, the goo is now a hazard as it will convert on contact
the-dump 2021-08-25 19:17:35 the best way to deal with it iirc is either
the-dump 2021-08-25 19:18:11 apply acid to goo to decontaminate areas where goo piles were found
the-dump 2021-08-25 19:18:25 or bring the specimen as a whole to an incinerator
the-dump 2021-08-25 19:19:43 latex is just a rubber, it can be destroyed through ways that destroy any other rubber material
the-dump 2021-08-25 19:20:47 at high temperatures it self ignites, when placed in the right type of acid, bacteria, or enzyme, the rubber will break down on a molecular level
the-dump 2021-08-25 19:23:54 the main thing to worry about is ensuring that every molecule is destroyed, the best cycle of action I've determined is
incinerate
capture smoke in filter
dissolve filter in solution
place container of solution in solid rock cave
collapse exits
melt rock near exits to seal gaps between rocks
the-dump 2021-08-25 19:24:49 alternative to rock cave for singular units is to enclose them in airtight titanium boxes welded shut
the-dump 2021-08-25 19:27:28 place boxes on stand (at least 1 foot high) in pit (at least 5 foot deep), fill pit with concrete, monitor site around pit 24/7, pit must be at least 25 feet above the water table and 1 mile from any known water sources
the-dump 2021-08-25 19:28:15 an important thing to note is the life cycle of the latex
the-dump 2021-08-25 19:29:22 they will occupy a host, without one, they will exist as a blob and 'hibernate', the maximum duration a blob can exist in hibernation for is unknown but likely limited
the-dump 2021-08-25 19:29:47 If you ensure the blob is trapped they will eventually starve.
the-dump 2021-08-25 19:31:11 the last thing humanity needs is the risk of the remnants of the creatures contaminating the water

the-dump 2021-08-29 22:28:10 Is dark green not a type of green?
the-dump 2021-08-29 22:28:31 Its literally just red but darker
the-dump 2021-08-29 22:29:33 Create a new word for every possible rgb combination with red value of 1 or higher
the-dump 2021-08-29 22:30:20 16,777,216 new colors are required for maroon to be not red
the-dump 2021-08-29 22:30:42 and that's just computational
the-dump 2021-08-29 22:31:06 you need infinity new words for colors as there's always another edge case

the-dump 2021-10-03 23:23:11 Have yet to see an actually crashed server
the-dump 2021-10-03 23:23:41 I'm thinking of an emergency mechanism to stop crashing though
the-dump 2021-10-03 23:24:15 If a person has a craft of x blocks, a minimum of y welds are to be expected
the-dump 2021-10-03 23:26:41 If they have for example 1000 blocks and 100 welds, on fly the vehicle is immediately returned to build with the note "Too Complex"
the-dump 2021-10-03 23:27:18 If they believe that the vehicle is actually legitimate, they can enter a bypass code given by mods after reviewing the item or go to the test server
the-dump 2021-10-03 23:27:48 If you have a massive ship, it probably isn't a thousand loose blocks
the-dump 2021-10-03 23:27:54 it is a thousand blocks welded together
the-dump 2021-10-03 23:29:30 if x% of the build is ropes and there is less than y actual blocks or z welds then it is assumed to be a lagmachine and will be returned with similar reason provided
the-dump 2021-10-03 23:30:53 Forgot that half of what they say is about among us or references it
the-dump 2021-10-04 00:44:57 I think "lieblingsfach" is referring to a 'preferred subject'
the-dump 2021-10-04 00:45:24 so they are saying "English is my preferred subject"

the-dump 2021-10-05 02:37:12 As this view is directly associated with hating furries, you declare that muscular chad man is actually a furry?

the-dump 2021-10-08 00:09:16 there has to be some form of other beings trying to get into the position of control for there to just be a powerful magic human there
the-dump 2021-10-08 00:10:06 Also why is heaven segregated by species
the-dump 2021-10-08 00:11:00 Sure a deer can go to heaven but what about a bull? An alligator? Ever seen something referencing the manifestation of such creatures in heaven?
the-dump 2021-10-08 00:11:35 The closest I've seen is a depiction of bulls from bull fights being released from hell
the-dump 2021-10-08 00:11:46 Not sure where they went tho
the-dump 2021-10-08 00:12:18 The logic behind the creation of the bible also is confusing
the-dump 2021-10-08 00:12:35 A guy says he wrote down the words of god and did a magic trick to convince people
the-dump 2021-10-08 00:14:02 To me it looks like a lot of it is just random children's stories stitched together into something official
the-dump 2021-10-08 00:14:33 "One day, the world filled with water, and two of everything was put on a boat to survive in the wasteland"
the-dump 2021-10-08 00:14:43 "This guy split a sea in half with magic"
the-dump 2021-10-08 00:15:04 "This water became alcohol"
the-dump 2021-10-08 00:16:36 Oh and some angels are supposed to be babies in gyroscopes made of eyes and are living wheels of a chariot that doesn't need wheels
the-dump 2021-10-08 00:17:21 Correct
the-dump 2021-10-08 00:18:35 Also I once saw a video mentioning a moth and it seemed biblical enough to actually be in one of the 31439571 bibles
the-dump 2021-10-08 00:19:42 I believe it may have had something to do with the creation of Icarus but there was no mention of the moth being made of material with a max temperature
the-dump 2021-10-08 00:20:23 cringe
the-dump 2021-10-09 06:08:36 You've pushed yourself into a corner for this one
the-dump 2021-10-09 06:08:52 If furries are to be treated as animals
the-dump 2021-10-09 06:08:58 they have the permissions of animals
the-dump 2021-10-09 06:09:26 by barring them from being civil they are no longer obligated to be civil
the-dump 2021-10-09 06:10:23 animal abuse laws apply to pretty much anything except insects and plants

the-dump 2021-10-11 20:55:49 System 32 is basically all of the critical stuff
the-dump 2021-10-11 20:55:55 your computer is bricked
the-dump 2021-10-11 20:57:48 I believe best option is
the-dump 2021-10-11 20:58:56 Have you tried pressing f8 while in startup and selecting repair
the-dump 2021-10-11 20:59:34 if other critical files were removed you may be unable to reach the startup to initiate f8
the-dump 2021-10-11 21:00:35 one option may be
the-dump 2021-10-11 21:00:48 to access the computer from another to restore it
the-dump 2021-10-11 21:01:15 the computer itself is unable to continue running but the not removed files should still be there
the-dump 2021-10-11 21:02:16 worst case it may be an option to transfer data off the computer, completely reset the computer, and put the data back on

the-dump 2021-10-11 21:04:12 a way to think of the scenario is that you have a car that had its engine removed, the car can still coast but its unable to propel itself, this is fixed by towing the vehicle with a functional one

bug-reports 2021-11-21 01:39:58 Unknown cause, indescribable moderately game breaking bug
https://vimeo.com/648170635
bug-reports 2021-11-21 01:40:23 Bug starts around 4:10
bug-reports 2021-11-21 01:42:47 Currently known effects listed in order of occurrence:
Craft flickers
Craft disappears
Player loses head
Craft reappears
Craft becomes partially intangible exclusively to owner
Craft partially returns to normal
Craft fully returns to normal
After some time (beyond video end), game crashes (Additional images attached soon)
bug-reports 2021-11-21 01:46:30 Bug is confirmed to be removed by:
Sufficient damage to craft
Bug may also be removed by:
Reset
Entering build mode
bug-reports 2021-11-21 01:48:19 After some time
bug-reports 2021-11-21 01:48:27 Error 260 appeared
bug-reports 2021-11-21 01:48:45 And game crashed upon attempting to reconnect
bug-reports 2021-11-21 01:50:01 My best guess is it has something to do with a 4 pronged cutter craft thing you can see bumping into me in the start, the glitch started moments after the craft touching me both times, the cutter craft also seemed to partially phase into my craft in normal gameplay, when attempting to toggle anchor on and off, the flickering occurred
bug-reports 2021-11-21 01:54:46 A very bad error I kept seeing was something like "HumanoidRootPart is not a valid member of "Workspace Darmagon3""
bug-reports 2021-11-21 13:23:26 My craft has:
No locked motor
About 15 or so unlocked motors
Anchor block(s)
About 15 or so pistons
One disconnector
12-24 suspension

From what I can tell the other person's craft has:
Multiple cutters
Explosives
Wheel blocks

They might be unrelated though
bug-reports 2021-11-21 13:24:57 Also forgot to say this earlier
bug-reports 2021-11-21 13:25:32 But I believe locked pistons when damaged crash your client
bug-reports 2021-11-21 13:32:58 Conditions that were present at time of locked piston crash:
Alongside other locked pistons
Extended
Possibly under stress at time of lock
Under stress at time of break
Zero gravity
bug-reports 2021-11-21 13:34:51 Unfortunately, all motors are used to turn something, there are some that can be removed without issue but shouldn't apply forces anywhere, and 4-8 that can be removed while compromising the central purpose of the craft
bug-reports 2021-11-21 13:38:32 Its one of those weird things that may have been caused by anyone or anything
Restarted network many hours before time of glitch
Was being repeatedly attacked by weird 4 prong thing immediately before each glitch
Craft uses non-physics anchors in a more strategic weird way which may conflict with the non-vital motors or the PVP environment, flickering appeared to respond to anchor
Craft is designed not to ride on the wheels but to grind against the floor while being pushed by wheels, every exterior surface that goes to the ground is a wedge of some form

bug-reports 2021-11-27 00:31:22 Seems odd that Roblox completely abandoned the color system for that, especially odd that it didn't start out with an rgb input
the-dump 2021-11-27 18:21:08 The final solution
the-dump 2021-11-27 18:22:04 This way if they introduce some form of "stop being a furry day" everyone will remain equal, placing everyone on the same level as previous furries
the-dump 2021-11-28 23:19:03 The issue is
the-dump 2021-11-28 23:19:19 By asking the question you call out to each individual person to make a decision for all others
the-dump 2021-11-28 23:19:34 The better option would be an anonymous vote
the-dump 2021-11-28 23:20:42 As with that, people only see the most popular choice, and people feel comfortable voting for a time that works for them as if people say otherwise then the opinion is discarded without any penalty to the voter

the-dump 2021-12-05 02:45:18 When a motor isn't supposed to be moving
the-dump 2021-12-05 02:45:29 It is welded
the-dump 2021-12-05 02:45:46 making it unable to move when it isn't supposed to be moving

bot-central 2021-12-25 09:13:31 Tip for minesweeper, if there is an arrangement such as:
bot-central 2021-12-25 09:14:43 Because 7 of 8 areas are confirmed to be safe, the top left square must be a mine according to the 1 in the center of the image
bot-central 2021-12-25 09:18:06 The more safe tiles unlocked around a tile, the more you know about the unknown center
bot-central 2021-12-25 09:20:30 Ahem
bot-central 2021-12-25 09:21:19 As you can see, the goal here is to learn more about the 7 covered tiles before making a guess
bot-central 2021-12-25 09:22:10 If complete tiles were ordered with 1 being top left and 15 being bottom right
bot-central 2021-12-25 09:22:30 Then tile 5 can be determined to be a mine because of the cornered 1 in tile 3
bot-central 2021-12-25 09:23:23 Because tile 5 is a mine and tile 9 is a 2, the only place for the other mine to be is tile 11
bot-central 2021-12-25 09:23:56 so now, the task is to identify the remaining 2 mines in the 3 tiles available
bot-central 2021-12-25 09:24:03 that is how minesweeper works
bot-central 2021-12-25 09:24:41 try it for yourself, all images have been taken from this game, I've tried to minimize the ability to use them for cheating but you could if you really tried

the-dump 2022-01-14 18:26:22 Cutter durability (Cutters take damage when a collision with another player's blocks is detected)
the-dump 2022-01-14 18:29:04 Kinetic damage penalty (Cutter damage reduced when weight of attached contraption is below ratio of cutters to mass)

the-dump 2022-01-14 18:30:08 Those are the 4 solutions that would directly solve shredder bugs and shredder spheres

the-dump 2022-01-14 18:31:37 issue is it may become the new shredder bug
