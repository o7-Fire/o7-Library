creations-chat 2021-12-05 02:07:08 I'm now working on an drift suspension with a race mode<:trollface:775024642104229898>
creations-chat 2021-12-05 02:18:03 I want it to go with no bounce,to get as much traction and go drag racing at other places like inside rails where it's pretty much alot of bumps so there's the suspension
creations-chat 2021-12-05 02:25:11 Plus when i get more speed my back suspension starts to slowly go down due to downforce once my front is angle up i getting more speed so i am using gravity to my advantage

Halo being hard to make i will ima let you away with that.what you could had done is to make the front wing rounder,make the rear wing have the holders for the wing and get rid of the barge board because due to the recent regulations changes they're going back to ground affect
