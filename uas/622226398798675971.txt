plane-crazy 2020-03-27 00:25:04 there I made it an .mp4
plane-crazy 2020-03-27 00:18:44 they should have been .mp4
plane-crazy 2020-03-27 00:18:30 idk why it downloaded as .wmv and not .mp4
plane-crazy 2020-03-27 00:17:49 lol ok
plane-crazy 2020-03-27 00:17:18 its deploying flares
plane-crazy 2020-03-27 00:17:12 plus (and idk why) the missile gets shaky when frames get low
plane-crazy 2020-03-27 00:16:43 My game drops frames while recording

plane-crazy 2020-03-27 00:16:29 Some footage of the missile
plane-crazy 2020-03-27 00:08:57 ?whois @[person's username]
plane-crazy 2020-03-27 00:07:15 The missile is big yes but its good quality, and you cant really size it down without making a crappier one
plane-crazy 2020-03-27 00:06:36 especially if you want a better performing missile
plane-crazy 2020-03-27 00:06:21 well its hard to get smaller
plane-crazy 2020-03-27 00:04:38 heres an example for a good missile
plane-crazy 2020-03-26 23:32:03 ill find/make an example to post here
plane-crazy 2020-03-26 23:30:43 the CL should behind the CG a bit (increases stability so it flies straight with no inputs) and obviously the control surfaces are there to steer. Those they are more effective the farther from the CG
plane-crazy 2020-03-26 23:28:56 Once you make the main part with the payload and engine you add control surfaces and flight blocks
plane-crazy 2020-03-26 23:27:37 Position of the CG is important in relation to your CL
plane-crazy 2020-03-26 23:26:59 What engine to use varies as each type has different weight that would effect the position of the CG
plane-crazy 2020-03-26 23:25:12 payload at the front and set to impact (obviously)
plane-crazy 2020-03-26 23:24:55 you need the thrust lift ( Center of Lift; CL), control, Center of Gravity (CG) and payload
plane-crazy 2020-03-26 23:24:28 <@!479273717609005059> Ive made a couple guided missiles
