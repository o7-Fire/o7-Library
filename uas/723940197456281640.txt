creations-chat 2021-04-13 04:32:23 <@!606731725959331840>  good tiger but you need to fix some stuff. The turrent muzzle ( if that is what is called ) should be smaller. The tracks look very lazy. Why do you only have The front sprocket, a wheel, and the rear sprocket??? The hull is very empty too. 

**Tip: Go to Sketchfab or any 3D website and refer to 3D models.**

creations-chat 2021-05-17 12:59:57 thats not really true. Its more like too much expectations but not that much expectation to make something impossible possible. Basically most people are not very open minded
creations-chat 2021-05-17 13:01:59 As someone said <#384025409945337856> is just elites flexing and there is no place for potential people.
creations-chat 2021-05-17 13:04:50 yea sure. I don't mind you not liking my tank. Everyone has opinion. I just think that sometimes people went too far
creations-chat 2021-05-17 13:06:52 I am not the best builder either. I need feedback to grow. So if you don't mind can you please tell me what you don't like about my tank? 😄

creations-chat 2021-05-18 05:03:04 Also why are you pissed about a guy giving feedback? Your problem is not being able to take criticism. Do you think these guys don't have to take criticism? The whole point of this channel is for feedback. You accept all the consequences when you post in creations
creations-chat 2021-05-18 05:05:40 Sure there are a lot of mean people in this channel but this isn't mean.
creations-chat 2021-05-18 05:07:41 Listen i will give you feedback. It looks great. The hull needs some tweaks. The front glass is weird. It just needs tweaks. Its not "ass". Don't let em discourage you.

creations-chat 2021-06-09 15:59:18 I changed my mind and i upvoted
creations-chat 2021-06-09 16:01:35 Same. I feel the pain. When I do something, i got downvoted but i get no feedback half of the time. 
I will probably never get Expert
creations-chat 2021-06-09 16:03:59 Build a good thing with one minor exposed motorlock and your build gets downvoted
creations-chat 2021-06-09 16:06:01 Its nice. You just need some more detail.
creations-chat 2021-06-09 16:08:15 I don't understand. I get help and feedback in the W.I.P stage and i fix what ever needs fix. And I still get downvoted. Maybe I suck. 

Also <@!642324788429324301>  i don't get why your build get downvoted. I mean you have good interior
creations-chat 2021-06-09 16:10:54 embed fail is like nightmare
creations-chat 2021-06-10 12:20:11 why builds with real effort get less likes but trash builds sometimes get more likes
creations-chat 2021-06-10 12:22:15 Can you elaborate please? I just don't get it. I thought PCC focus more on effort.
creations-chat 2021-06-10 12:24:30 Sure but why does those crappy "joke" builds get more likes then someone who put real effort in it.

Details are sometimes not enough i guess. <@!659514717496147969>
creations-chat 2021-06-10 12:27:05 ok then should i care about upvotes and downvotes in general.

creations-chat 2021-06-19 11:43:07 I changed the design of the turrent to make it slide down the hull and to put the stuff at the barrel.

creations-chat 2021-06-20 03:52:39 <@!407347404858458123>  Just change it to a white flag or a pirate flag ( to avoid controversy )
creations-chat 2021-06-20 03:55:14 Sadly Plane Crazy Community is not that fond of LGBTQ
creations-chat 2021-06-20 03:59:15 Don't get me wrong. I like your ship and I upvoted. Just telling that most people here can bash you for the smallest thing
I ignored the flag but I can't change other people's opinion and I respect their opinion
creations-chat 2021-06-20 04:02:00 Sure. Its out of place. We can't change the creator's decision. Its a minor thing for me tho
creations-chat 2021-06-20 04:05:13 A war machine with rainbow flag do is out of place tho ( i don't have any problems with LGBTQ )

creations-chat 2021-06-20 04:24:39 why not put a pirate flag it would fit more. If you don't want to, thats okay.
creations-chat 2021-06-20 04:26:47 I guess its fine then. The flag is not that of a deal for me at least.
creations-chat 2021-06-20 04:28:49 the wing control surface is too small i think. Make the control surface one block longer and put the motor on the front.
creations-chat 2021-06-20 06:14:30 Plane crazy moment. What troubles me is people caring about a flag and not look at the details
creations-chat 2021-06-20 06:29:57 LMao

creations-chat 2021-06-20 08:01:26 No one downvoted? Hyper bot is a bot its not counted as a downvote

Also Downvotes and upvotes are nothing
creations-chat 2021-06-20 08:03:30 You wont be able to hit anything with those rockets.
creations-chat 2021-06-20 08:05:35 Ranks serve no purpose. Its useless. You still get bashed even if you have the expert rank.
<@!594101576579416064>  When did i say anything about control surfaces? What I am saying is default rockets suck so bad it can't even track something 5 meters away
creations-chat 2021-06-20 08:08:19 nah most experts use white for troll reasons lmao
creations-chat 2021-06-20 08:10:21 Yea. Some people use mouse controlled rockets for a reason
creations-chat 2021-06-20 08:12:44 No no no. Use keyboard to control plane. Idk its your creation. Just saying that default rockets are bad
creations-chat 2021-06-20 08:15:31 <@!594101576579416064>  It looks better now. No need to thank me. I was not the first to address the issue
creations-chat 2021-06-21 03:40:58 It looks epic
creations-chat 2021-06-21 03:53:30 epic <@!682677856765214770> Looks great. Camo good. Cockpit good.
creations-chat 2021-06-21 04:00:23 <@456226577798135808>  Lower plane is better but i won't downvote
creations-chat 2021-06-21 04:17:21 paint camo
creations-chat 2021-06-21 04:19:39 ok
creations-chat 2021-06-21 04:26:04 yea blame me for the downvotes.
creations-chat 2021-06-21 04:28:06 seriously paint it a natural camo. The jet itself is good.

creations-chat 2021-06-21 06:36:04 Yes. If you want to know which one is better. go to <#384021699466756107>  or <#504436696021204992>
creations-chat 2021-06-21 06:50:26 yes
creations-chat 2021-06-21 07:05:34 <@!677258938772881429>  Delete the 3 upper guns.
creations-chat 2021-06-21 07:09:39 better. Now if possible make the jet engines look more like real jet engines. *check WW2 jet fighter pics* to get inspiration
creations-chat 2021-06-21 07:12:31 ok now. Science time. In 1944-1945 fuel supplies were low and you need to think of a way to generate electricity. 

There is a fan for the ME163 that generates electircity for the jet engine to work. Add something like that
4 engines mean a lot of fuel needed
creations-chat 2021-06-21 07:14:41 Oh. Sorry then. 

But my point is that he should add some details like that little fan that generates electricity
creations-chat 2021-06-21 07:17:03 fix paint too. Make it darker 
and make the lower body light grey or white.
creations-chat 2021-06-21 07:19:08 Not sure about that. 

I guess my knowledge about planes suck <:Thonk:509498568982134816>
creations-chat 2021-06-21 07:25:09 > It wasn’t a propeller, propellers are for propulsion. It was a ram-air turbine that drove an electric generator. 
Found this on Quora.
creations-chat 2021-06-21 07:27:20 I don't know. I go there to find facts and memes Dont judge me

creations-chat 2021-07-14 04:12:19 I think he looked at the wrong photo and mislabeled it happens often with Suhoi aircraft. 

I mean I once made SU 35 and everyone said i need canards but i can't find any canards in my referance photo. Then when i add canards it looks like a SU 37 so i just changed the save name.
creations-chat 2021-07-14 04:14:23 elevators are too angled. wing is fine. color is fine
creations-chat 2021-07-14 04:16:30 He gave some fair points bro. So I would learn from his roasts. He even gave you some blueprints
creations-chat 2021-07-14 04:18:40 It may look inaccurate but well I can see the effort. Just fix the elevator, and add some hull details.

the-dump 2021-07-16 07:35:16 you don't need speed reader too
the-dump 2021-07-16 07:35:45 radar is pratically useless
the-dump 2021-07-16 07:36:06 Plane crazy is not ace combat, war thunder or DCS
the-dump 2021-07-16 07:37:23 ok first off most jets and planes are big, second most carriers are not even that big to carry other player's plane
the-dump 2021-07-16 07:37:47 And people would not bother to slow down they would just straight up ram into the carrier
the-dump 2021-07-16 07:37:53 not now

the-dump 2021-07-16 07:39:34 and everyone would be lagging even if the ship is big enough
the-dump 2021-07-16 07:40:04 Radar would be cool but it doesn't really add any good thing or fun to the normal gameplay
the-dump 2021-07-16 07:40:53 yea but sadly these will not be added
the-dump 2021-07-16 07:41:16 i still want missles but these are a fantasy

creations-chat 2021-07-22 13:56:00 Don't care about downvotes, they will just break your confidence. care about the roasts and feedback.
creations-chat 2021-07-22 13:58:12 I don't usually curse the shit out of builds but yea you are still right.

I don't like how some people will argue with people giving feedback tho.
creations-chat 2021-07-22 14:00:20 Some people too arrogant to upvote a good build when they have like 1 expert rank. 
Some people will hold a grudge against someone just because the person went a little harsh on his build
creations-chat 2021-07-22 14:04:08 <@!642324788429324301>  damn thats some big brain calculations
creations-chat 2021-07-22 14:08:23 Many downvotes doesnt always mean bad build
Many upvotes doesn't always mean good build too. 

Some builds are underrated.
some builds are overrated

Honestly I would not care about upvotes, downvotes. Don't go too serious. Its a game. Try to have fun. This is the most important thing.
creations-chat 2021-07-22 14:11:12 Yea maybe i am wrong but as i said, the most important point of the game itself is to build creative things and have fun. <@!446538909963386883>  nice stug
creations-chat 2021-07-22 14:17:46 I maybe wrong but i think thats called un-openminded
creations-chat 2021-07-22 14:20:14 Dude they can build whatever they want. Mind the skill level too. Not everyone can make a goddamn airliner. Same applies to fighter jets. 

Your sentence is basically saying "these kids making what they want never think to make my preferred plane types. My plane type is better"
creations-chat 2021-07-22 14:25:02 I make crocodile robot get downvoted to kingdom come. I make small exploration custom submarine get downvoted to oblivion 

I suck at that time but when i try to be creative, I still get hated so I don't know what to do

creations-chat 2021-09-15 02:01:12 <@456226577798135808> feedback on my plane? 
I am trying to gather feedback but none of you white names don't respond or simply just straight up downvote for me having a rank
creations-chat 2021-09-15 02:04:56 Look.
i have asked others for feedback and one just straight up say i am higher rank than him and another say nothing i just downvote.
I already hidden the motorlock read the text bru 
how did i screw up the nose and cockpit i already overlapped blueprints on them and they are fairly accurate.
The carnard is big because its impossible to do it detailed with other wing types
creations-chat 2021-09-15 02:07:10 yea but still the fact that all downvoters are white names
creations-chat 2021-09-15 02:11:08 yea i was quite wrong about pinging them and asking for feedback sorry if i was intrusive.
but bruh one of them litterally refuse to give feedback and the other one said i am too high rank. more goes on.
creations-chat 2021-09-15 02:13:55 anyways i was rude and sorry about that. I just become mad because its a project i have been working for a while and i put a lot of effort into it.
creations-chat 2021-09-15 02:24:03 i had a very terrible upvote/ downvote ratio before and i cope 🗿 

now i post a build i have been working on say, 3 weeks. Procrastinating, gathering feedback, fixing stuff.

some people downvote but refuse to give any useful feedback  ( not saying you, you give good feedback actually )

I became mad and butthurt. I became rude <:nooo:787097964946259978> 

ye sometimes a small amount of more upvotes can boost ego

<@!523003901075521536>  cool
creations-chat 2021-09-15 02:30:29 lesson here is that you don't care too much about upvotes and downvotes .

creations-chat 2021-09-15 09:04:11 no offense and i know i am bad but 
Downvotes are just fake internet points as well as upvotes. if you care too much about them, its not good.
downvotes can hurt people's confidence sometimes but you need to cope 🗿 adapt and improve

creations-chat 2021-10-05 05:20:08 bro literally posted many build mode pics and other useless photos

Tip: don't post like "top view, front, back" etc

Just post a pic or two that shows clearly and a great angle
creations-chat 2021-10-05 05:24:18 most people don't know this but DO NOT post  top view, side views, etc ( except some cases ).
It really makes the builder look bad at photography. ( not saying you need to be a photographer,etc)

Take great angles that showcase the details not show them one by one ( floods chat and drowns other builds )
As bonus try to recreate some cool pics like this with a friend or edit your ships in the photo
creations-chat 2021-10-05 05:26:40 very cool and nice. Also add the little string or rope if you can
creations-chat 2021-10-05 05:29:12 also example 
This guy only did 3 pictures of his build that has great lighting, angle etc  

Instead of posting top view, bottom view, you should do this

creations-chat 2021-10-06 08:02:22 constructive criticism: color is a poor choice  use better colors like grey 
the canopy and spine is awful ( can't suggest fixes on this since i don't know the idea/ concept behind this
creations-chat 2021-10-06 08:05:11 litterally gave idea on how to improve color
I am sorry but if you want criticism listen to it instead of arguing
creations-chat 2021-10-06 08:08:45 ok if you don't understand. Apologies for my aggressive words.
1.  the color  looks out of place since it is a strange pattern of blue and white. ( can be improved by using a normal color like grey )
2. th ecanopy doesn't fit with the plane ( please refer to real life planes )
3. the angle of the rudder can be more angled

my S-323btw. I still need a good camo.

I am interested in MIG 1.44 i will build it tomorrow

<@!792842138999980034> thank you for the suggestion. S-32 is a concept plane so it is quite hard to find camo. I will combine the camo from Ace Combat and make it look more like a desert camo

creations-chat 2021-11-13 05:58:54 so uh I made a few changes
Currently, the plane has
-ejection seat
-working airbrake
-high G vapour effect

intakes are angled 
in this pic, I didn't angle it that well.
the spine looks quite rough because i wanted to fit the airbrake.

<@!582639638397845514> that will need a lot of angle locking and motorlocking

bug-reports 2021-11-26 04:36:35 In this "well mannered" server known as Plane Crazy Community, I am quite "disturbed" by your "unnecessarily formal" sentences. I, and my dear friends will appreciate if you would stop the "flex" and communicate with us in a non-formal way.
bug-reports 2021-11-26 04:39:32 Sir, check your "device" of any issues and please check your internet connection kindly, for this "bug" is a server ( or ) a connection issue. Tallyho!
creations-chat 2021-11-26 04:43:41 Visibility is poor. Kindly, take another picture with a better lighting and a better angle.
bug-reports 2021-11-26 04:45:23 Grammarly is great software, to be honest. However, it has some flaws. I prefer using my own English skills with the help of Grammarly occasionally.
creations-chat 2021-11-26 04:47:01 looks pretty great. Make the blue more dull and less bright to fit in with the rest of the colors
creations-chat 2021-11-26 04:53:24 yes but still short
creations-chat 2021-11-26 04:58:38 what the actual fuck

creations-chat 2021-11-26 07:27:38 Tip 1: do not cry about downvotes they are fake internet points
Tip 2: dont cause drama
tip 3: no one wants to hear you whining about people not liking your build

high ranks don't usually pick on lower ranks. In fact, they respect lower ranks too
creations-chat 2021-11-26 07:29:41 Oh my god
People dislike my build 
This community sucks

You know what i am gonna lie for snow flakes so that they don't think the community is shit
creations-chat 2021-11-26 07:32:25 ye man
 "ungrateful haters" 
Bro literally mocks people who have an opinion

<@!738064035135750224> people would if he doesn't start drama
creations-chat 2021-11-26 07:37:18 That is true though. People could have been less harsh <:Mhm:551152556324159488>
Fighting harsh standards is like fighting piracy. It is not effective and makes you look like a clown.
creations-chat 2021-11-26 07:40:22 I bet if I say remake the whole room to make it look like a reactor room, I would be called toxic.
Like bruh  make it a little more believable. 💀

<@!738064035135750224> that won't help him much 
its just general tips
creations-chat 2021-11-26 07:42:45 that is the problem. you lack reference material
You probably don't have a room plan too
creations-chat 2021-11-26 07:44:55 what i meant is if you are gonna make a tough project or a custom creative stuff plan it ahead
like I literally planned my Fenrir 5 hours ahead in MS paint 💀 
its just a sketch but it helps you visualize what blocks you wanna use 
Trust me it will be much easier to build if you have a plan

<@!401530469952389130> i only plan on hard as shit stuff like the xfa 33
creations-chat 2021-11-26 07:48:13 feedback on fenrir 💀  it hovers

creations-chat 2021-11-26 08:01:43 start of drama <:FineTroll:626841259746656289>
he did ask for feedback in a rather questionable way
He can't stand some fake internet points <:Downvote:490311668556103700> 💀
creations-chat 2021-11-26 08:04:23 I will recap the situation for ya

He post build
people downvote
he start drama
arguement
people give tip
some people cause more drama
me recapping

<@!451025784228806656> some feedbacks were kinda short one liners like "get good" 💀
creations-chat 2021-11-26 08:08:09 Tinon the problem isn't the harsh feedback
it is people not filtering the real feedback out of harsh ones
I am not saying harsh feedback is good and all people can stand harsh stuff
They usually confuse good but a little harsh feedback with bad feedback 
Good feedback need to have truth and the truth can be quite harsh

<@!660019099430289418> naise
creations-chat 2021-11-26 08:11:48 No they didn't. They just downvoted because it is their opinion. YOU Started the whole drama
creations-chat 2021-11-26 08:14:13 No one poked him. He is crying about downvotes from the start. He is calling it harassment and harsh to bad builds.
I don't feel like defending this guy anymore.

Ignoring feedback will not improve your skills.

creations-chat 2021-12-06 16:15:16 I don't think they are used for rolling
In my opinion removing 1 motor ( roll motor ) will make the elevator look better
creations-chat 2021-12-06 16:19:58 Fair enough.
I kind of think it doesn't use the elevator for roll since it has big wings and it will probably be used for turning maybe.

Why is it that people don't motor lock in some wing panels to fill gaps 😭
creations-chat 2021-12-13 08:30:49 Simple way to fix it make the tail wing that doesn't rotate has a gap to fit in the elevator

Motorlock in the elevator

firstly the nose should be a little tilted
second the rudder is too big

creations-chat 2021-12-17 02:12:34 you probably need angle lock for wing
creations-chat 2021-12-17 02:15:03 Yes
You already have good spine, nose and canopy
just make it so that it has bigger motorlock tower so you don't have to restart it again if you mess up 
I recommend 10 stacks of vertical lock for su 57
creations-chat 2021-12-17 02:18:54 well i use a lot of angle locks on my builds and use a lot of motor lock because I mainly build for looks but if you do it right you can make it good for PVP ( for example: adding conveyor drives, hover engines, more control surfaces etc

creations-chat 2021-12-17 08:54:48 no 
he could have just shortened the canopy by 1 block and increased the length
creations-chat 2021-12-17 08:57:11 increase = more ( make it longer )
By shorten the canopy i mean just the canopy not the entire thing

<@!404632014189494293> lmfao 
experts downvoting shitty planes is all because of jealousy its a fact!1111 
-some random low rank
creations-chat 2021-12-17 14:18:40 Well considering I don't like this build it is not downvoted because of jealousy
Well considering I like this build it is downvoted not because it is shit but jealousy 

|| yea ok ||
creations-chat 2021-12-17 14:20:59 still, though a lot of the downvoted creations I see are not bad to me. Considering that that some people decided to post there and agree to receive criticism which is basically shaming them for it
creations-chat 2021-12-17 14:23:03 You started this whole conversation crying about some fake internet points and yet here you are.
creations-chat 2021-12-17 14:25:05 Or the whole build is disproportionate and ugly as shit
These slight imperfections for you can be jarring flaws for others.
creations-chat 2021-12-17 14:28:05 <#384025409945337856> is meant to be fair. ranks and name colors doesn't change standards usually. If you don't want feedback don't post at all or ignore
creations-chat 2021-12-17 14:30:16 The "shit on bad builds" usually is constructive criticism you deem too harsh
creations-chat 2021-12-17 14:32:31 start over = the build needs a remake simple 
Its constructive criticism Its a suggestion

I love how most arguments here are people victimizing themselves to gain sympathy
creations-chat 2021-12-17 14:35:55 Stereotype but he got a point here.
some cavemen can't change from the your build is trash phase
creations-chat 2021-12-17 14:42:53 since argument die 
I need feedback 
plane is ( adfx 02 )
creations-chat 2021-12-17 14:46:43 You got a good point but I don't see the fault of the community in this situation.

creations-chat 2021-12-18 06:53:26 The build i don't like = 7987 upvotes 12 downvotes
The build I like = 14 upvotes 987 downvotes

This is how you sound. They get upvotes because maybe they are actually good and not some disproportionate "unique" plane
creations-chat 2021-12-18 06:56:11 The motorlock bs is totally funny

This is a non motorlock build lmfao
creations-chat 2021-12-18 07:01:45 I am tired of this conversation every single day with fucking idiots crying about fake internet points
1. Opinions exist, if you can't cope with them ignore them
2. Your opinion is not a fact and a good plane for you is bad for the other.
3. motor lock or not nobody cares
4. if it is good it gets upvotes, if it is bad it doesn't simple.
5. You agree to receive votes and criticism as soon as you post in <#384025409945337856>  if you can't cope with criticism ignore them

It is like 
"I agree to the terms of service"
Then proceeding to cry about it
creations-chat 2021-12-18 07:03:51 Show me the "neat unique plane" that gets downvotes and I will show you the fucking flaws in under 5 minutes
creations-chat 2021-12-18 07:31:11 I agree that <#384025409945337856> is harsh but its equal. 
Experts and low ranks get treated the same. If we low standards for those who are less skilled that will be inequality

creations-chat 2021-12-21 04:04:46 Close your mouth and stop bickering at once, person with the higher synthetic level. You are bickering about unnecessary "issues" that is just the whole build itself. It would make sense if you can build better than this talented individual.

creations-chat 2021-12-28 09:04:20 the nose is wrong
the wing is wrong
intake is not angled
a lot of exposed locks the canopy is short
creations-chat 2021-12-28 09:08:02 1. Make the plane bigger ( microbuilds are hard to shape and fix )
2. use angle lock to make a good nose 
3. the wing just need some adjustments
creations-chat 2021-12-28 09:11:25 I don't blame you or anyone for liking small builds but make the nose 2 blocks high nose scale ( this scale )

epic expert feedback 😎👌
creations-chat 2022-01-01 14:21:38 Conclusion: 
1) Do not assume someone is underage just because they are unskilled
2) Do not call someone giving feedback a dumbass

creations-chat 2022-01-01 14:26:45 It is hard to get feedback on the build when a large portion of the PCC  kind of assert dominance over less skilled people

I  agree with you 74%

creations-chat 2022-01-05 09:02:05 You are not famous enough to have haters
The color of the mech is pretty bright and the mech is shaped strangely
creations-chat 2022-01-05 09:04:53 Put your ego aside
the mech has a lot of problems. 
1. there is a huge gap 
2. the head is underdetailed 
3. the torso looks flat and plain
4. hands are large and shaped weirdly 
5. legs are fine
6. the paint
creations-chat 2022-01-05 09:08:22 Okay but other problems still exist
detail by adding antennas, armor and a better paint
Other than that I like the mech 

<@!765318482753224704>  :|
creations-chat 2022-01-05 09:11:43 You should make it bigger next time if you want it to look like this

creations-chat 2022-01-10 08:38:11 don't pre-make the length. I usually build a placeholder nose and a canopy then change the nose according to referances. Then I build wings or intakes depending on plane. if I finish the wing, I work on the engines and elevators.
creations-chat 2022-01-10 09:49:33 hey man your helicopter is great however this part looks a little messy.

creations-chat 2022-01-10 13:20:51 coming from a guy who can say no better than add more detail.
problem is most people don't realize feedback don't usually contribute much to a good build.
its the maker's skills that contributes most
creations-chat 2022-01-10 13:23:12 ok but how do you make something more complex a lil

I am gonna admit, I am kind of a hypocrite here as I also sometimes give these kind of feedback
creations-chat 2022-01-10 13:26:20 best way of giving feedback ( for me )is 
1) ask for a side view or a top view
2) overlay blueprint or top view image
3) give them a reference/ 3d model to work on
4) let the image speak for itself. you don't need to do much except saying stuff like make it longer, make it wider
5) if they can't understand how a part of the build needs to be constructed use diagrams and such
creations-chat 2022-01-10 13:29:45 👀
Blueprints are an easy and effective way to check accuracy ( if done right )

creations-chat 2022-01-18 05:53:20 i thought the standards are lower than usual this month
creations-chat 2022-01-18 05:55:51 to be honest, it is the lowest i have seen
not really complaing though new players get more useful feedback nowadays
creations-chat 2022-01-18 05:58:08 low normally but sometimes the standards spike up a lot.
some builds get caught up in that spike and gets more downvotes than they would usually

that is what i am witnessing as of now

and why would the air force put an inaccurate gun on something the troops are gonna have to rely on
creations-chat 2022-01-24 08:45:48 First off it is CAS or close air support which means you have to hit the enemy while your team is nearby. your weapon needs to be accurate not to hit your own team
Second even if the gun miss the shrapnel could probably hit you still

creations-chat 2022-01-28 02:26:04 To be honest, it is an easy target. It has a big silhouette and a rocket strike could wipe out all the weapons/ take the vehicle out as a whole. Shredders could avoid your "Saw" as well. It is not really a good defense against a shredder
creations-chat 2022-01-28 02:32:59 What the fuck is that logic

creations-chat 2022-01-28 05:10:49 panzer 3 looks very oversized 

Tiger and panther looks really small
creations-chat 2022-01-28 05:17:44 what scale did you use?
It kind of looks disproportionate in some way
creations-chat 2022-01-28 05:19:49 pretty cool but i think the propellers look small

<@456226577798135808> Sr's tank seem the most proportionate and to scale  with the 5'1" roblox character scale
creations-chat 2022-01-28 05:22:44 why rely on actual calculations tho
I understand you are trying to make it to roscale but it ends up looking stretched
( upvoted for cool camo and detail tho )
creations-chat 2022-01-28 05:25:02 fuck popular tanks

help 2022-01-28 07:26:13 Basically, put whatever you want to be called. 
But others can refuse to call you by your pronouns 

HOWEVER
The community here makes a deal out of someone just putting pronouns in their bio ( even if they don't even bother anyone or ask someone to call them by their pronouns)  

Most people assume that the person feels like he/she is special and superior to be asking to be called in a special pronoun but it is not true most of the time
help 2022-01-28 07:28:48 So if they are attacking you for no reason you are not in the wrong. 

But if you insist that you are called in your pronoun, people are not legally needed to do it.

the-dump 2022-01-28 07:43:50 Most people are confusing Joebama's award-winning fiction novel with real historical events.

creations-chat 2022-01-31 06:43:44 its not "mediocre" 

In my opinion, it is a weird build.

Some parts are really detailed and good but some others are not. 

The bad part is the rear and wings. The good part is the engine, cockpit etc
creations-chat 2022-01-31 06:46:40 better than my first ww2 plane by 200%
Just keep building more and you will soon get better
creations-chat 2022-01-31 06:49:26 compare 

1. the front of hull is kind of weird
2. the turret is too high up
3. kind of long

Thats all, i would say its a 6.8/10 build
creations-chat 2022-01-31 06:51:52 Its a good attempt in my opinion. Just improve it according to feedback and it will turn out to be a good build.
<@!401530469952389130> plane crazy is very limiting for a building game. The fact that you have to use a bug to get stuff right is depressing

creations-chat 2022-02-07 06:37:37 With due respect,that is wrong grammatically.

creations-chat 2022-02-07 08:32:18 what
creations-chat 2022-02-07 09:04:33 Why is it that something as simple as someone not being fluent at English lead to huge claims?
creations-chat 2022-02-07 09:07:08 Are we going to ignore that the person who is apparently in the "right" continuously posted these GIFs and replied to the other person with a childish response which is "Ok and".

I am not saying that anyone is right or wrong but we should see this from both perspectives.
creations-chat 2022-02-07 09:10:46 I mean the person probably didn't take the joke well since he responded with this.
creations-chat 2022-02-07 09:16:31 Firstly the cannon looks out of place. 
The torpedos are out of place too.  I understand you made that for PvP but the shape could be more round too.
creations-chat 2022-02-07 10:33:10 The word is filtered though. So that will be counted as a bypass.
creations-chat 2022-02-07 10:46:15 No, it is a cool game 👍

I was just commenting on someone's reply
creations-chat 2022-02-09 10:58:34 This wasn't even an argument to begin with. It was a normal chat between inventor and Kiernen. Kiernen had a misconception. I did some research and tell what I think is right to him/her. Then people talk and I comment on somebody else's reply.
creations-chat 2022-02-09 11:01:38 I do not understand why the blame is on me. The whole discussion was caused by inventor and kiernen in the first place. I just simply stopped by and commented on it twice

The build was amazing, featuring a 155mm barrel, three wheels on each side for extra mobility across any terrain, and even a commanders seat to lead his men in battle. Unfortunately, there was one problem with Chris's War Tank; there was a bad paint.

creations-chat 2022-06-03 13:52:01 I probably missed it. As I said I was quite dumb and inexperienced with sail boats so I didn't study the characteristics of a schooner that well. I just know it as a small ship with two masts. Now I am reworking it because the one in <#384025409945337856> was inaccurate to real life

creations-chat 2022-06-08 04:06:37 It isn't a debate in the first place you just barged in like a karen and had a problem by misinterpreting the joke.
creations-chat 2022-06-08 04:57:52 Do you know how wrong that is
creations-chat 2022-06-08 04:59:57 It is not just the technology the f22 has the shape to reduce its radar cross section size or something 
Su series planes has huge wings, huge nozzles and external weapons stealth would be impossible. Even the su 57 has a large radar cross section because of the huge engines.
creations-chat 2022-06-08 05:05:25 Try dcs and see how hard it is to actually out manuever one missile. let alone more than one. The sukhois are cool and all but the f22 can manuever as well as them too
The f22 won't even be known to exist to the su pilot with stealth
creations-chat 2022-06-08 05:07:56 the US maybe dystopian but their technology is undoubtedly ahead of russia. Russia has the upper hand with anti air and ground but not the sky itself
creations-chat 2022-06-08 05:10:20 The maybe advantage the sukhoi has is that there is a chance that indian pilots can outmatch the americans.

PVP scale is what I assume to be 1 wides but with blocky camos, disconnector and trapdoor spam, usually have a motor sticking out at the top of rudders and sometimes very exposed motorlock. 80% of the time cheese gratar and very disproportionate. 

Example: Namnam's su35 from one of his videos
the-dump 2022-06-09 15:10:35 wha
the-dump 2022-06-09 15:11:21 I think monks live in temples
the-dump 2022-06-09 15:11:38 as well as some old men who are just there because they want to
the-dump 2022-06-09 15:12:17 therefore muangwafter is an old monk

creations-chat 2022-06-10 04:14:59 only atg i see on google is this 
Looks nothing like the build unless i am missing something

<@733919777793507389>  very nice 3d model I am inspired
creations-chat 2022-06-10 04:48:07 the wide mouth part came from the right side
he probably hooked it to a cable system above and used cameras to join
NVM i think it is delayed lock https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/919868152278556706/984680560045719552/unknown.png
creations-chat 2022-06-10 13:20:12 the back part of wing needs to be more steep i think and the elevators bigger that is all
creations-chat 2022-06-10 13:24:31 how is 
Also how to add canopy frame to cylinder canopy
creations-chat 2022-06-10 13:26:33 oh alright thanks <:ElonApprove:589130525315301380>

creations-chat 2022-06-10 15:13:14 <@700596846493696032> why your nose long
creations-chat 2022-06-10 15:15:28 Bruh you don't need to be good to make the nose shorter
creations-chat 2022-06-10 15:21:51 
creations-chat 2022-06-10 15:38:17 Hello Infinity indeed
creations-chat 2022-06-10 16:17:39 doesnt matter how long a steak is cooked if it is bad it is bad
Same goes for builds

other than that everything is spot on <:ElonApprove:589130525315301380>
creations-chat 2022-06-11 04:39:43 add exposed motorlock and it will be spot on 👌
creations-chat 2022-06-11 04:42:01 No need overlay 
the plane is way too long and hide the motorlock inside the intake if possible
also f4 phantom is best at 2 wide
Not saying 1 wide f4s are bad but 2 wide f4s are generally easier to make and looks better
creations-chat 2022-06-11 08:42:13 feels weird without freebird
creations-chat 2022-06-11 08:57:13 Maverick was right, maverick was right memes are not funny
creations-chat 2022-06-11 10:45:21 I like the g force vapor
creations-chat 2022-06-11 11:44:23 so its stolen
creations-chat 2022-06-11 11:46:25 I see maybe report to mods for posting a copied build. The only thing i can do rn is downvote.
creations-chat 2022-06-11 11:53:36 still it is just a rebrand of an identical build
creations-chat 2022-06-11 14:04:03 does it look ok? 
Don't mind the color
help 2022-06-11 14:15:53 who told you that
creations-chat 2022-06-11 14:20:50 ye it look short right now because the spine is a place holder
creations-chat 2022-06-11 15:10:54 final count down mid ace combat chad
creations-chat 2022-06-12 02:40:49 Only good namnam pvp plane is f15 imo

creations-chat 2022-06-12 03:59:01 https://tenor.com/bzkeQ.gif
creations-chat 2022-06-12 04:23:46 <@706717603258957864> fix the intake by making it the right shape and making the blackpart wider. make the elevator bigger and wing should be wider to the back
creations-chat 2022-06-12 04:26:00 also cockpit is a little short other than that it is good imo
creations-chat 2022-06-12 05:50:49 put the video in slow motion and send it to tree factory and act like you recorded it again <:trollface:775024642104229898>
creations-chat 2022-06-12 13:24:09 bruh it should have 2 wide the wings actually look good
creations-chat 2022-06-12 13:26:13 what do you mean
The wings and elevators have good proportions and the shape is accurate mostly

5th gen planes ( fat noses ) and flankers are best made with 2 wide scale anything less than that simply look mid.
creations-chat 2022-06-12 13:28:39 idk its your chocie your su 57 just doesn't look chunky and fat like the real one
creations-chat 2022-06-12 13:34:36 1 wide isn't shit for american planes except f22 imo
fat nosed planes like su 35, su 57 and eurofighter just doesn't look good unless you are some demi god
creations-chat 2022-06-12 15:46:25 why people make a lot of dc 10s
creations-chat 2022-06-12 15:49:43 https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/919868152278556706/984841223586058310/unknown.png
creations-chat 2022-06-13 03:47:59 what is that
creations-chat 2022-06-13 03:50:10 make angle locked cockpit
Cylinder or wedge cockpit but angle lock
Increase spine length
creations-chat 2022-06-13 04:01:21 what plane ?
<@334473424355196938> that is not the problem the problem is that there is no 1x2 half triangle wedge and putting half triangle wedge is ugly
creations-chat 2022-06-13 04:03:31 way too short and the real one angles downward near the end
creations-chat 2022-06-13 04:05:47 What kind of tip is that
creations-chat 2022-06-13 04:07:50 doesn't make sense if you build a small vtol with the same shape and build the bigger one, there will be differences in weight because of motorlock and al that.
creations-chat 2022-06-13 05:11:25 wtf
creations-chat 2022-06-13 13:45:11 ye
creations-chat 2022-06-14 02:37:34 ngl that rc plane sick 
I have seen someone do super manuevers with the rc planes
creations-chat 2022-06-14 02:47:20 how do i fill the gaps at the near end of the wings?
creations-chat 2022-06-14 02:49:23 oh alright  thanks
creations-chat 2022-06-14 03:02:39 its an exact copy lol
creations-chat 2022-06-14 03:08:20 its an adfx 02 ( weird ace combat plane with forward-swept wings and a big stick on the engines for amateurs )
the-dump 2022-06-14 03:49:35 
creations-chat 2022-06-14 04:14:27 I would want to but the pistons are so glitchy that half of the times it goes wrong. thanks for the suggestion tho
creations-chat 2022-06-14 04:18:09 bruh 
that is not the problem
Pistons either reset when i lock or they go bollocks or they just don't move
creations-chat 2022-06-14 04:42:07 what is that

creations-chat 2022-06-14 08:59:35 how is
<@453015366281723905> yes
creations-chat 2022-06-14 09:09:51 gaps i know
creations-chat 2022-06-14 09:13:39 i am covering the gaps right now don't worry
creations-chat 2022-06-14 09:15:47 side + gaps covered. I feel like rudder looks weird
creations-chat 2022-06-14 09:17:49 thanks
creations-chat 2022-06-14 09:19:59 idk the real one looks very small
plus anything bigger than that will make the plane disproportionate
creations-chat 2022-06-14 09:22:13 it matches up?
<@693086613747793920> thanks
creations-chat 2022-06-14 09:24:15 sure I will do that right now
creations-chat 2022-06-14 09:30:45 Mig 25
creations-chat 2022-06-14 09:34:30 I think i made it way too long. I will make it shorter
creations-chat 2022-06-14 10:11:40 maybe add some fighter jets 
your carrier huge so i don't see why not
The bridge is a little too blank and simple 
other than that amazing and detailed

creations-chat 2022-06-15 12:34:21 bruh he has said again and again he is colorblind lol
creations-chat 2022-06-15 13:01:05 yea it sucks 
I also have mild Deutan or something like that even though it isn't as severe as what you probably have
creations-chat 2022-06-16 03:58:23 kinda harmful because of  the wonky nature of <#384025409945337856> 
More builds = more good builds
Good builds become average because there is way too many of them and standards sky rocket. It happened with mig-21 builds
creations-chat 2022-06-16 04:02:43 Top gun mav had F-18s i thought
creations-chat 2022-06-16 04:09:25 'A nice aircraft powered by two pieces of junk'
creations-chat 2022-06-16 04:11:58 lots of people hate f35 because it is expensive and not as "good" as f-22. If f-35 was not as expensive everyone would probably say it is the best fighter
creations-chat 2022-06-16 04:17:02 And another factor is that it is uglier than f-22.
creations-chat 2022-06-16 04:31:16 the su 33 just yeeted itself like physics are optional
creations-chat 2022-06-16 04:40:37 It can happen if the f22 and f35s are intercepting a su 57
But then it would be over in 5 seconds because one of them will stay behind and fire when the su 57s starts attacking
creations-chat 2022-06-16 04:45:41 "Intercepting"
They have to get close and like ask the plane to leave using plane sign language or something
creations-chat 2022-06-17 03:08:55 I doubt they need stealth. Their rival is probably the eurofighter, gripen and other european planes ( no stealth planes )
creations-chat 2022-06-17 03:11:17 That is true but still America and Russia would probably just engage in nuclear warfare
Idk for sure this is just my amateur opinion
creations-chat 2022-06-17 03:13:22 they will get detected before they get near jet screaming distance though. Especially since stealth planes can like fight each other 100km away or something
creations-chat 2022-06-17 03:15:26 True
Some slavaboos say it will lose because of that one incident where a su33 and f-22 were operating in the same space and the su33 detected the f22
creations-chat 2022-06-17 03:18:12 The us is gonna say it was a UFO to avoid war <:trollface:775024642104229898>
creations-chat 2022-06-17 04:33:39 disproportionate 
Short, not wide enough
creations-chat 2022-06-17 11:18:10 maybe f-15? but nose is quite short for f-15
creations-chat 2022-06-17 11:20:50 <@757887014388367401> i know its hard but is it possible to hide the motorlocks on the ropes? The rest is fine.
creations-chat 2022-06-17 11:24:34 if so it is way too big and ugly imo maybe used sparkler or a smaller object
creations-chat 2022-06-17 13:14:38 Get ready to see...

creations-chat 2022-06-17 13:17:21 Bro the stats are mostly classified or just not true.
Do you think the government would just reveal the true details of their weapons
creations-chat 2022-06-17 13:20:32 Let's reveal what our fighter is capable of so that the enemy knows they need to step up their game and possibly develop a counter based on that info!!!
creations-chat 2022-06-17 13:26:09 Apparently the russians did. They made a thicc jet with cruise missile engines because of a speedy bomber concept
creations-chat 2022-06-17 13:28:23 nah i am referring to the mig 25 which was made because of the xb 70 which was supposed to go mach 3  i think
creations-chat 2022-06-17 13:58:58 but doesn't it have higher maintenance cost since it has one more engine to it?
creations-chat 2022-06-17 14:01:27 ok but F-35 has a bigger number than F-22 so it is clearly better !!! ME262 is the best fighter jet because it has more than 200 number!!!
creations-chat 2022-06-17 14:07:18 no it has 22 more numbers than f-35 so it is clearly better than the f22 by kilometers ( 1000 ar 15s for americans )
creations-chat 2022-06-17 14:11:51 i think it is a camo/stealth joke like ply said
creations-chat 2022-06-17 14:15:15 F-18 has a gun that can go all degrees + unlimited flares and a WSO that can turn her head 360 like a demon

creations-chat 2022-06-23 15:39:40 dell Inspiron 5593 
Dell laptops have unreasonably limiting safety measures so i had to push the temperature limits and then overclock so I don't get 5 fps in demanding games ( very not recommend it can fry your gpu if you do something wrong )

And don't buy this laptop it is pretty shit and Dell handicaps it for no reason
creations-chat 2022-06-23 15:42:20 not worth it unless you have good cooling. I recommend undervolting though. it is safer and reduce temperatures + can improve performance. The worst thing it could do to your laptop is crashing into a bsod and it will reboot automatically.

i will never recommend dell lmao. It is a very controlling manufacturer who limits hardware capability for no good reason
creations-chat 2022-06-23 15:44:37 ye i think so maybe make the spine angle less steep but other than that it looks quite accurate

creations-chat 2022-06-25 03:12:06 Ok he will improve but that doesn't change the fact that the food he gave to me right now is bad. That is what this is all about. some people might shit on you but you must filter the actual criticism out of the shit instead of you know, ranting about it and causing a second 7 years war. Let's be real all right, you understood you will get some hate if you post the build. If you can't cope with it, just don't listen.

creations-chat 2022-06-25 03:20:38 I think we have a mutual understanding here. I do not support the shitting on new players bs and I wasn't targeting him either. Let's end this debate and hopefully ensure this wretched place get better <:bigyoshi:557242825301819423>

sometimes i think the game is bugged and the speed values are displayed incorrectly. it is a real annoyance for angle locking. or check if there is something blocking or rubbing against the motors

creations-chat 2022-06-26 06:00:25 its hard to explain without a pic but side motorlock is useful if you dont have space to place intake
creations-chat 2022-06-26 06:09:38 alright i will log on to hell crazy and show you how

The yellow is to pull the intakes 0.5 close to the fuelsalage
the blue one is the angle motor The other motors are unnecesary it is just to make a 1.5 wide intake

creations-chat 2022-06-26 11:57:56 I thought it was a custom. I just upvoted because I thought it was creative and it is not that bad
creations-chat 2022-06-26 12:08:33 1. said someone is jealous when they didn't like your build

creations-chat 2022-06-28 03:06:44 i am pretty sure chunk is much more than that
creations-chat 2022-06-28 03:15:43 Long story short
 
Chunk built fine builds some of which got a lot of upvotes in his early days
things started going downhill when he got the piss color name
He just started getting pissed when someone say he is wrong or something. he is real loud and aggressive for an expert 
He is kinda like "Dhar Mann"; his feedback is just pretentious and extra positive
creations-chat 2022-06-28 03:18:16 OMG you will be sent to the hell known as Chunk Theory's blocklist 😭

creations-chat 2022-06-28 03:25:58 tootipoodi ( rip ), ImHereForGam3, and 99eryay
creations-chat 2022-06-28 03:28:36 true but he doesn't post much in <#384025409945337856>  and i haven't seen him get hof

creations-chat 2022-06-28 03:53:41 it would be fine if the feedback wasn't the equivalent of dhar mann videos
creations-chat 2022-06-28 04:39:08 understandable.

creations-chat 2022-06-28 05:03:21 look above he literally said the feedback didn't matter because of the skill level
He wants criticism then rant about people being critical
creations-chat 2022-06-28 05:07:25 funny thing is all of this started because he didn't accept feedback and people just started giving angry feedback 💀 
zas originally said he needs to fix something and chunk ignored it then when someone else said that he accept and when zas pointed out the hypocrisy he said this
creations-chat 2022-06-28 05:09:29 bro he gets mad when someone like hars put word like shit fuck in their criticism even though he can ignore here is his response 
if he has common sense he should be able to ignore the insult and use the picture to improve
creations-chat 2022-06-28 05:12:13 maybe but the above person attached a photo with circles and people go out of their way to give feedback. I mean he usually start big arguments because of those kinds of replys
I can understand why people might agree with him but uh i don't like his passive aggressive high horse attitude
creations-chat 2022-06-28 05:16:04 yes but I think he still could have handled it differently
apart from it when someone points out the flaws of his build he still go rage mode 

I think both feedback givers and he is wrong here honestly
creations-chat 2022-06-28 05:18:08 He could be a good candidate for heated debates <:trollface:775024642104229898>   + at least he has the balls to apologise
creations-chat 2022-06-28 05:20:43 until the next argument <:largerabbit:772883550349426719>

the spine doesn't curve right away tho it maintains low angle for a short distance then curve normally
and the nose a little short maybe
creations-chat 2022-06-30 11:26:25 you must be in the warped vision phase where you don't see anything wrong and you somehow think something looks good. Don't worry though it is normal.

creations-chat 2022-07-01 04:34:07 I think I understand why people don't bother to give feedback now. 

Maybe it is because when given feedback they don't do what the person told to do and people aggressively defend their build.

creations-chat 2022-07-01 13:32:48 ye the cockpit a little small other than that the plane looks decent and finally it is not a f-14 or a f18
creations-chat 2022-07-01 13:42:30 the only underrated planes are wright flyer 1 and 2
creations-chat 2022-07-02 03:44:12 <@680299162901938217>  wing needs to be a tad bit shorter. Other than that it looks great

creations-chat 2022-07-02 06:28:28 we get it, you are gay,binary, pan, morse code whatever. But almost everyone is born with a gender ( either male or female )  and you can identify as a refrigerator later on, we don't care.

Figure it out
creations-chat 2022-07-03 12:03:17 wings are totally inaccurate 
Engines are comically large 
Proportions are eh
creations-chat 2022-07-03 12:09:48 Proportions are not about scale size.
Don't you learn this? It is in like grade 4,5 maths
in this case the engines are comically huge compared to the rest
creations-chat 2022-07-03 12:14:14 Why is it that you must retreat to the safety of mindless insults? Can't cope about being proven wrong with actual proof?
creations-chat 2022-07-03 12:17:48 I will just leave this here
creations-chat 2022-07-03 12:22:38 Hot take: 1 wide looks good, when proportional and accurate.
creations-chat 2022-07-03 12:25:50 This time some person said proportionate = ro scale so i proved him wrong and got mad
creations-chat 2022-07-03 12:28:17 no need for roscale just make it accurate. 1 wide, 2 wide, 3 i don't really care just make it proportionate 😩

creations-chat 2022-07-03 12:42:11 It is more or less because the experts slowly being inactive, leaving pcc or not play pc. standards drop. children can't stand feedback. a newbie revolution happening and literally tearing pcc into two.

creations-chat 2022-07-03 12:44:48 I agree with that.At least PCC isn't all hars wannabes no more but kinda feel like <#384025409945337856> is hitting a new low every day. But this is just my two cents. Two cents from a nobody

also why it was named after morgan is apparently because the whole game has all these king Arthur references and there was someone named morgan in the king arthur story so maybe because of that

creations-chat 2022-07-08 03:48:28 Who are you making a point to? I only see one guy who has elon musk pfp and say literally nothing concering idolizing him.
creations-chat 2022-07-08 03:51:54 You are saying you idolize whatever this thing is?
Like some people have xin jin ping pfps for the memes or some have putin
creations-chat 2022-07-08 03:55:34 Good point but like you should have dmed the guy.
creations-chat 2022-07-08 03:58:23 bro sent 4 articles of tesla harassment and child labor but nobody cares and he calling people ignorant
creations-chat 2022-07-08 04:02:36 Why do you even have a problem with his pfp? You wasted your energy by raising awareness here. You could have gone somewhere else  and actually raised awareness
creations-chat 2022-07-08 04:06:26 How would I know? You seem to be keen on educating us, random people in a roblox server about child labor.

creations-chat 2022-07-08 13:57:13 imo it would have looked better without shaders. because of the shaders you can see the outline of wedges and imperfections at the front
creations-chat 2022-07-08 13:59:15 Yeah of course. The shader is just my nitpick.

<@966987356852846613> it creates friction. slows things down
creations-chat 2022-07-13 03:17:19 No I asked.
creations-chat 2022-07-13 03:20:29 No bro, friction in real life acts on everything but in plane crazy friction block only works on the ground. If you want  friction while in the air, use wing panels and make the surface face whatever axis you want to slow down

creations-chat 2022-07-13 06:50:25 At this point people are just trying to prolong this argument. Just go home everyone.

creations-chat 2022-07-13 06:53:07 I apologize on behalf of both parties. It was clearly a misunderstanding. I am really getting irritated by this nonsensical argument.
creations-chat 2022-07-13 06:57:23 Let me explain. So there are 3 groups here. 2 extremes ( way too sensitive people and extremely toxic people) and there is a more neutral less extreme group. Since late 2021 the sensitive group grew in numbers and this channel experiences more arguments than before.

 <@564463541248065547> why are you pinging me i am not even supporting either sides i am just trying to defuse the situation
creations-chat 2022-07-13 06:59:26 Nas D*ily 

<@514501014368550912> yeah i can see that you are neutral. Your car is pretty nice too. maybe paint or hide the exposed motor in the back though.
creations-chat 2022-07-13 07:03:44 It is fine. I can understand why you are mad, commit die is pretty sad and it is not good to make fun of it but I will say it again, it is just a huge misunderstanding.
creations-chat 2022-07-13 07:06:30 A lot of people will just commit tax fraud, pirate software and movies and probably ddos people. I doubt they are gonna start killing

creations-chat 2022-07-15 05:07:21 he kinda is true. It is just extremely expensive. it can manuever fast and a fleet of those will kill anything and they have datalink tech and stuff so idk
creations-chat 2022-07-15 05:10:29 i mean it falls behind flankers but again it has stealth. as double said it is a nightmare logistically but in terms of performance it is certainly better than su 57.
creations-chat 2022-07-15 05:12:45 funny thing is flankers had off bore sight for decades since the su 27 i am sure. 
<@683015364975657024> dogfighting is still quite relevant tbh. eg. ukraine
creations-chat 2022-07-15 05:14:54 bro su 27 from the cold war had that technology. it isn't new
creations-chat 2022-07-15 05:18:03 Yes? the plane's short range missiles can do that.

And a lot of aircraft simulation games and full fidelety ones like dcs have it
creations-chat 2022-07-15 05:21:14 isn't it because f-35 only seen combat with clueless middle east insurgents 💀
creations-chat 2022-07-15 05:23:54 different planes 
A-10 is close air support, f-35 is multi role stealth fighter <:stuff:908917207986208828>
creations-chat 2022-07-15 05:26:05 that is true. what i meant to say is that. a-10 is primarily cas while the f-35 is the jack of all trades and is new so of course the a-10 would have more losses. Anyway i am no expert, this is just my opinion

creations-chat 2022-07-16 09:10:57 Top view and front view NOW!
creations-chat 2022-07-16 09:20:26 is the back part of wing angled
creations-chat 2022-07-16 09:23:44 there is a slight angle if you look carefully but it is just a nitpick
creations-chat 2022-07-16 09:34:29 fack yuo
creations-chat 2022-07-16 10:31:57 around 90-150 probably
it is proportionate and the camo seems nice
( yes i was here since like 2020 )
creations-chat 2022-07-16 10:34:25 which got 146?
Your plane or that f-18
F-18 not that bad but the engine and spine is kinda odd
creations-chat 2022-07-16 10:39:28 ngl the camo is a little odd at the mid section -> end but it is good plane
creations-chat 2022-07-16 10:41:35 not really. A critical person can look for mistakes even easier since ( most ) shaders posted here have some sort of lighting that makes the builds show every single imperfections. Even still if it is very disproportionate, you can still pick apart.
creations-chat 2022-07-16 10:44:42 You all make fair points. I have seen lots of disproportionate or low detail builds with shaders that have more upvotes than they should 
<@523003901075521536> wait these are shaders?? I didn't even know 💀
creations-chat 2022-07-16 10:48:20 I like shaders that look like the one used in the tank pic but not the ones that have extreme rtx god rays with 200 bloom

creations-chat 2022-07-16 12:46:03 props to the guy for matching lighting and textures in blender
creations-chat 2022-07-17 02:58:29 i think it looks ok but the back part needs to be angled
creations-chat 2022-07-17 05:13:12 why is it that any post that starts with "This is my friend's build" always have a doo doo fard creation

creations-chat 2022-07-18 03:00:34 what about water vehicles???
creations-chat 2022-07-18 03:29:27 a lot of people here are pretty confident like they call their builds hot or beautiful. Some of them actually looks good but a lot of them are just over confidence
creations-chat 2022-07-18 05:38:03 I think it is good. Maybe make the intake have a black piece inside to make it look more obvious from the front view
The hardpoints way too big imo
creations-chat 2022-07-18 05:42:10 maybe just put armaments instead of dedicated hardpoints

creations-chat 2022-07-18 08:56:37 You whine about a post not having the upvote button now though
creations-chat 2022-07-18 08:59:34 And the skill of someone giving feedback is also irrelevant mostly. You don't need to be able to perfectly cook steak to know that the steak you just paid for is burnt. 

( no offense to jack and his plane, i am not commenting on the build )
creations-chat 2022-07-18 09:01:55 Look, my point is that, you don't need to be expert supreme to know that a pile of blocks is bad since it seems that your skull is too thick to understand a common point.
creations-chat 2022-07-18 09:05:53 I never even said his plane is bad. I literally said " I am not commenting on the build"
creations-chat 2022-07-18 09:14:27 I was just tidying my room. I am not glued to my seat always. I never once implied or said that I was critiquing his plane at all. I was commenting on the fact that your argument on "someone needs to be able to build better to critique something" is really irrelevant.
creations-chat 2022-07-18 09:17:15 and my point was that it is irrelevant because unless out of jealousy or some kind of resentment it is perfectly fine to critique someone even if you are not better than them. Like do you shut up when a rich person harass you because he is better at you in terms of wealth??
creations-chat 2022-07-18 09:20:13 ok but your criticism of my argument is invalid because you have creations black list and i have more ranks than you. 

That is your logic
creations-chat 2022-07-18 12:46:02 ok rbk but funny thing is i exist here just to witness funny activity
creations-chat 2022-07-18 12:56:17 That is true. I will try not to go overboard next time
