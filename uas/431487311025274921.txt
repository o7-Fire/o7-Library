plane-crazy 2020-06-27 05:54:38 I haven't blacklisted my friend
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 05:54:32 negative
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 05:54:17 I don't think you understand english mate
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 05:53:00 but people who aren't in flight mode can't collide with trains anymore
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 05:52:47 made sense before
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 05:52:44 people in flightmode, sure makes sense
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 05:52:37 Collide with trains
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 05:52:35 PEOPLE WHO AREN'T IN FLIGHT MODE
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 05:51:45 why can players not collide with builds spawned at rails when not in flight mode
plane-crazy 2020-06-25 06:07:28 doesn't mean you need to be a good builder
plane-crazy 2020-06-25 06:07:20 well you must be creative
plane-crazy 2020-06-25 06:05:29 not spamming blocks
plane-crazy 2020-06-25 06:05:26 being creative is how you play a sandbox game
plane-crazy 2020-06-25 06:05:14 a lag machine IS NOT creative
plane-crazy 2020-06-25 06:05:10 you're meant to make something creative
plane-crazy 2020-06-25 06:05:04 but like
plane-crazy 2020-06-25 06:05:03 well yea
plane-crazy 2020-06-25 06:04:54 if you dont like the way you play a game, don't play it
plane-crazy 2020-06-25 06:04:46 idk how its so hard to just PLAY THE GAME properly
plane-crazy 2020-06-25 06:04:34 no need to ping me lol
plane-crazy 2020-06-25 05:53:11 This idiot made a lag machine. Nice that we cant even report users now
plane-crazy 2020-06-25 02:35:46 but very annoying
plane-crazy 2020-06-25 02:35:44 very slightly
plane-crazy 2020-06-25 02:35:37 <@!667756016116695040> I have the same problem with a boat of mine too, but its turning left
plane-crazy 2020-06-25 02:35:14 well it is symmetrical
plane-crazy 2020-06-25 02:33:18 Please explain why a symmetrical build is heavier on one side
plane-crazy 2020-06-25 02:23:31 ok nvm my problem is motors not being the weight of a normal block
plane-crazy 2020-06-25 02:18:35 ðŸ˜ 
plane-crazy 2020-06-25 02:18:31 Why are trapdoors not the same weight as a normal block
plane-crazy 2020-04-05 17:00:52 Anyone able to give me some kind of explanation on how to make planes that work? (a video would help too)
plane-crazy 2020-04-05 16:12:42 Is anyone with a rank willing to post a suggestion I have?
