The Tale of britishtrainspotting (431487311025274921)
bug-reports 2020-04-05 16:01:46 water propellers don't loop the spinning animation, they just get stuck and won't get unstuck until lowering the rpm, but the bug still continues after.
I have them on a platform attached to pistons, that may be whats causing the bug
After a couple of minutes the entire platform and most blocks connected to moving parts just "exploded" and disappeared (entire build flung)

bug-reports 2020-04-05 16:42:02 That would be useful in most cases though... Wish I had that bug, would help with alot of builds
bot-central 2020-04-05 16:43:17 %suggest Ability to change the grid placement, a 1 stud grid is cool and all but would be nice if we had some options (0.1 , 0.5 grid , 1 , 2 ,)
bug-reports 2020-04-10 19:55:10 why are all my planes now super back heavy?!
bug-reports 2020-04-10 19:55:22 none of my planes work after the new roblox update
bug-reports 2020-04-10 19:56:21 roblox did a bad update and sleeping parts exist again
bug-reports 2020-04-10 23:10:21 why are planes broken in every server? is this due to the roblox sleeping parts bug that has reappeared?
bug-reports 2020-04-10 23:29:50 roblox sleeping parts seem to be the problem
bug-reports 2020-04-10 23:30:05 just gotta wait for them to remove it again
bug-reports 2020-04-10 23:30:14 its not a 100% occuring "bug"

bug-reports 2020-05-17 02:43:57 Any cameras in an anchored build breaks the Entire build
bug-reports 2020-05-17 02:44:21 I cannot use cameras at all in my build
bug-reports 2020-05-17 03:05:57 I have a build with over 3k Blocks
bug-reports 2020-05-17 03:06:01 its mostly anchored
bug-reports 2020-05-17 03:06:13 it has some moving parts such as parts connected to motors
bug-reports 2020-05-17 03:06:34 wym
bug-reports 2020-05-17 03:07:50 he tried undoing it, it gave him an error

bug-reports 2020-05-17 03:09:40 I don't have time to upload to youtube

bug-reports 2020-05-17 03:12:34 imma upload shortly
bug-reports 2020-05-17 03:12:45 imma show a screenshot of what a SINGLE camera does
bug-reports 2020-05-17 03:12:55 
bug-reports 2020-05-17 03:13:05 this is an anchored build
bug-reports 2020-05-17 03:13:25 cameras are beasts
bug-reports 2020-05-17 03:14:31 inside
bug-reports 2020-05-17 03:14:40 the build is anchored
bug-reports 2020-05-17 03:14:47 all the parts that have glitched are anchored
bug-reports 2020-05-17 03:15:03 I'm reporting a bug
bug-reports 2020-05-17 03:15:10 I don't need the camera outside
bug-reports 2020-05-17 03:15:15 I need them inside
bug-reports 2020-05-17 03:15:43 I literally fail to see how a camera would do this, unless it was EXTREMELY poorly scripted or something
bug-reports 2020-05-17 03:15:55 its bizarre really
bug-reports 2020-05-17 03:16:00 but I just tested your theory
bug-reports 2020-05-17 03:16:04 its fine outside
bug-reports 2020-05-17 03:16:13 the camera is definately making a PHYSICAL link to something
bug-reports 2020-05-17 03:16:34 how do cameras "Connect"
bug-reports 2020-05-17 03:16:43 I placed one outside
bug-reports 2020-05-17 03:16:46 build was fine
bug-reports 2020-05-17 03:16:52 but camera was invisible / gone
bug-reports 2020-05-17 03:17:12 it was connected
bug-reports 2020-05-17 03:17:30 wait
bug-reports 2020-05-17 03:17:34 I might have found the problem
bug-reports 2020-05-17 03:17:51 or not
bug-reports 2020-05-17 03:18:06 outside seems to be fine
bug-reports 2020-05-17 03:18:10 inside, is another story
bug-reports 2020-05-17 03:18:37 any camera outside goes invisible
bug-reports 2020-05-17 03:19:03 ah
bug-reports 2020-05-17 03:19:04 
bug-reports 2020-05-17 03:19:08 so its broken when its placed inside
bug-reports 2020-05-17 03:19:12 its visible inside
bug-reports 2020-05-17 03:19:18 and, breaks the entire build
bug-reports 2020-05-17 03:19:36 I honestly don't know
bug-reports 2020-05-17 03:19:49 just
bug-reports 2020-05-17 03:19:51 Anywhere
bug-reports 2020-05-17 03:19:57 I've literally tried this 5 times yesterday
bug-reports 2020-05-17 03:19:59 different locations
bug-reports 2020-05-17 03:20:04 inside? goodbye build
bug-reports 2020-05-17 03:20:09 outside? fine
bug-reports 2020-05-17 03:20:20 atleast where I've tried it outside its fine
bug-reports 2020-05-17 03:20:28 imma try other places to see if its still the same
bug-reports 2020-05-17 03:22:10 
bug-reports 2020-05-17 03:22:15 The rocket in the centre is unanchored
bug-reports 2020-05-17 03:22:21 but I've tried before the rocket existed
bug-reports 2020-05-17 03:22:28 anywhere inside + camera
bug-reports 2020-05-17 03:22:30 = hell
bug-reports 2020-05-17 03:22:38 no matter where I place it
bug-reports 2020-05-17 03:22:40 on the floor
bug-reports 2020-05-17 03:22:42 on the ceiling
bug-reports 2020-05-17 03:22:43 on the wall
bug-reports 2020-05-17 03:22:48 near the border
bug-reports 2020-05-17 03:22:51 near the centre
bug-reports 2020-05-17 03:22:59 just anywhere inside
bug-reports 2020-05-17 03:23:04 the camera decides to become satan
bug-reports 2020-05-17 03:23:49 I think so
bug-reports 2020-05-17 03:24:05 most definately welding wrong, but idk how
bug-reports 2020-05-17 03:25:11 aight
bug-reports 2020-05-17 03:25:15 lemme get the camera back in place
bug-reports 2020-05-17 03:25:39 what the...
bug-reports 2020-05-17 03:25:42 the cameras fine now
bug-reports 2020-05-17 03:25:44 wait a minute
bug-reports 2020-05-17 03:26:21 this is strange
bug-reports 2020-05-17 03:26:23 its not acting up
bug-reports 2020-05-17 03:26:29 even though its in the exact same spot
bug-reports 2020-05-17 03:26:33 exact same orientation
bug-reports 2020-05-17 03:26:35 nothings changed
bug-reports 2020-05-17 03:26:39 except time
bug-reports 2020-05-17 03:27:17 nothing shows up in the F9 log when it happens
bug-reports 2020-05-17 03:27:20 imma send it anyway
bug-reports 2020-05-17 03:27:33 actually
bug-reports 2020-05-17 03:27:37 none of this is related
bug-reports 2020-05-17 03:27:53 if any errors are showing its defo in the global output
bug-reports 2020-05-17 03:28:16 Client outputs (what a non-dev sees) don't tend to show much
bug-reports 2020-05-17 03:28:22 its just stuff from when I joined
bug-reports 2020-05-17 03:28:26 shows every time I join
bug-reports 2020-05-17 03:28:46 Aight
bug-reports 2020-05-17 03:28:58 I'm as confused as you are
bug-reports 2020-05-17 03:29:11 I've never seen this happen before
bug-reports 2020-05-17 03:29:15 except with motors
bug-reports 2020-05-17 03:29:29 its not fixed
bug-reports 2020-05-17 03:29:40 I think its when I target it on a moving part
bug-reports 2020-05-17 03:29:45 but its welded to an anchored part
bug-reports 2020-05-17 03:29:48 that might be the problem
bug-reports 2020-05-17 03:29:51 but thats just a theory
bug-reports 2020-05-17 03:29:55 I'm still not entirely sure
bug-reports 2020-05-17 03:30:33 I'm going to test this a bit further
bug-reports 2020-05-17 03:30:45 I am starting to suspect its exactly what I said
bug-reports 2020-05-17 03:31:58 
bug-reports 2020-05-17 03:31:59 Like this?
bug-reports 2020-05-17 03:32:06 aight
bug-reports 2020-05-17 03:32:32 yeah its not broken
bug-reports 2020-05-17 03:32:42 I think its when a camera is welded to an anchored part
bug-reports 2020-05-17 03:32:47 and its looking at a movable part
bug-reports 2020-05-17 03:32:57 thats all I can suspect from my tests
bug-reports 2020-05-17 03:33:32 Do you still want me to get that video?
bug-reports 2020-05-17 03:33:41 aight
bug-reports 2020-05-17 03:34:14 aight , it's going to take a min or two
bug-reports 2020-05-17 03:34:24 yeah
bug-reports 2020-05-17 03:36:53 did you delete the block it was facing at/targetting?
bug-reports 2020-05-17 03:37:39 cameras are demons
bug-reports 2020-05-17 03:37:50 when/if this bug is fixed, I'd like a 3rd person camera too
bug-reports 2020-05-17 03:37:55 would be helpful for tracking rockets
bug-reports 2020-05-17 03:38:03 or just remotely controlling vehicles
bug-reports 2020-05-17 03:38:52 Should I test this bug on other builds?
bug-reports 2020-05-17 03:39:05 I can build some random things to see if its the same
bug-reports 2020-05-17 03:40:17 that would invalidate the result though
bug-reports 2020-05-17 03:40:26 so
bug-reports 2020-05-17 03:40:26 I don't have locked motors on my build
bug-reports 2020-05-17 03:42:19 I FOUND THE PROBLEM
bug-reports 2020-05-17 03:42:26 When a camera is facing a different way
bug-reports 2020-05-17 03:42:35 the blocks its welded to ROTATE to its orientation]
bug-reports 2020-05-17 03:42:50 and when anchored blocks come into it, well its gets more messy
bug-reports 2020-05-17 03:43:05 also https://streamable.com/rluxek
Its processing
bug-reports 2020-05-17 03:43:10 but yeah
bug-reports 2020-05-17 03:43:16 this is 99% certain the cause
bug-reports 2020-05-17 03:43:41 Anchored blocks aren't the cause / problem
bug-reports 2020-05-17 03:44:05 actually
bug-reports 2020-05-17 03:44:08 100% The cause
bug-reports 2020-05-17 03:44:39 very strange
bug-reports 2020-05-17 03:44:45 but we found the problem
bug-reports 2020-05-17 03:45:00 ~~when you speak to rick to get the problem fixed, can you ask for 3rd person cameras too?~~
bug-reports 2020-05-17 03:45:10 what do you mean helpful?
bug-reports 2020-05-17 03:45:24 true
bug-reports 2020-05-17 03:45:37 but its a glitch that breaks alot of stuff so
bug-reports 2020-05-17 03:47:56 also are you allowed to throw that request in
bug-reports 2020-05-17 03:50:51 fair enough

1. Materials
This is a simple one to add, please add all roblox materials into the game, the current list of materials is missing some very decorative materials such as bricks or the forcefield.
2. Please allow us to place wedges inside other wedges if in the opposite orientation (and other blocks that physically fit within the same blockspace) This would allow for some very awesome decorative abilities of which currently aren't possible
3. Weld Blocks, this will be similar to the paint block, but instead of allowing painting on all sides, allows you to choose which sides weld and which do not. Alternatively a way to break a weld connection from happening with touching blocks would also be very useful, alongside allowing the weld to be remade (A weld tool)

creations-chat 2020-06-29 05:23:28 bru
creations-chat 2020-06-29 05:24:14 its a roblox limit bruh
creations-chat 2020-06-29 05:24:26 if you could have infinite, you'd easily be able to make an exploit and break roblox
creations-chat 2020-06-29 05:24:36 or make a game that did such a thing
creations-chat 2020-06-29 05:25:02 I mean, if you run your game on your own server and not roblox's then you can have infinite if you so choose
creations-chat 2020-06-29 05:26:55 ok, making a mech is harder than it seems
creations-chat 2020-06-29 05:28:46 motors aren't glitched

bug-reports 2020-09-19 21:33:37 Due to a roblox physics update (I presume) motors now randomly glitch and builds containing motors are more or less broken
bug-reports 2020-09-19 21:34:13 to be specific any flush doors are extremely affected
bug-reports 2020-09-19 22:40:33 trapdoors are also client only
bug-reports 2020-09-19 22:40:41 they do not work for other players
bug-reports 2020-09-19 22:41:07 also when standing on anothers build you get moved along like its a conveyor
bug-reports 2020-09-19 22:57:28 kk
bug-reports 2020-09-19 22:57:34 screw roblox
bug-reports 2020-10-20 20:38:55 When a player is blacklisted in a game, they will remain blacklisted until you leave and rejoin the game. Not sure what causes the bug. Minor bug really.
bug-reports 2020-10-20 20:44:56 also trapdoors, engine sounds and engine animations are client only, they don't show for other players
bug-reports 2020-10-23 01:24:25 trapdoors are client only, their state only changes for the client whom is controlling the build with them
bug-reports 2020-10-23 02:26:43 they break everything lmao
