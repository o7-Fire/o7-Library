the-dump 2022-11-14 15:01:03 what'
creations-chat 2022-12-11 12:14:43 helping my friend build a T28
creations-chat 2022-12-11 12:17:44 probably if he can since he doesnt really use roscale on big tanks
creations-chat 2022-12-11 12:20:32 first of all if he uses Springs the springs would be stuck inside the tank second i told him to use camera because hes gonna use a angle lock for the front\
creations-chat 2022-12-11 12:27:59 dawg? you removed the springs
creations-chat 2022-12-11 12:30:03 PLUS we are making a bigger tank and sometimes the springs get stuck in big tanks but we cant do roscale so thats exactly not my Problem. nope i wont
creations-chat 2022-12-11 12:34:51 so I'm just gonna force my friend to use a dang spring since making him use TNT will blow up a build? no bro I won't force my friend for just a single spring
creations-chat 2022-12-11 12:38:43 I aint still making him use TNT blocks so I am not your peasant to do your orders
creations-chat 2022-12-11 12:41:23 great here we go again
creations-chat 2022-12-11 12:46:25 bro you really got to wait 6 days for realistic tracks? do you even use damn roscale when you use normal builds like that karl gerat you sent on the floatybox methclub
creations-chat 2022-12-11 12:48:43 see ur wrong your not even using like 1:5 roscales or smth you only use damn normal blocks i dont even see a damn motorlock
creations-chat 2022-12-11 12:50:52 all you do is build normal tanks and try to use tracks with it that tracks doesnt even have suspensions even milo's JG PZ E100 suspension's is better and look bro I cant do this anymore all you do is ask for help but your build is only a normal build with blocks or somethin you gotta change bro its like roscale is very easy YOU EVEN GOTTA WAIT 6 DAYS FOR A DAMN TRACK
creations-chat 2022-12-11 12:54:44 "Little tank" then explain why your karl gerat was over like 20-30 blocks
creations-chat 2022-12-11 12:57:20 I'm not forcing him to make Normal builds ALL i am saying that he only builds normal builds and he cant even do roscale when he doesnt even know angle lock with a damn  T-62M out of a T-62A
creations-chat 2022-12-11 13:02:20 IF HE WOULD make a roscale tanks would Floatybox be impressive for his first time? YES. but atleast we give a f about those details not even PCC players could handle in big tanks
creations-chat 2022-12-11 13:05:05 I AM AND LOOK HE WONT EVEN MAKE A ROSCALE TANK look <@901190057648603177> cant you justt make a single damn roscale tank so we can end this damn arguement
creations-chat 2022-12-11 13:08:34 they damn use the details we use
creations-chat 2022-12-11 16:41:26 what can i add to this? the tank body after the details of the turret. <@697870811117387899>
creations-chat 2022-12-11 16:44:19 <:BIG1:588443768806703124> <:BIG2:588443778554134540> 
<:BIG3:588443788721258534> <:BIG4:588443798842114088>  sadly I dont have gold bars. i can just use like a angle locked one. and I dont think M1A2 Abrams has bag because all I see is just a openable armor.
