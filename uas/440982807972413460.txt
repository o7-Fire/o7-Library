creations-chat 2020-12-18 04:25:12 Advice on my jet is appreciated!
creations-chat 2020-12-18 04:34:31 I did use the glass marital, I'll move the cockpit up.
creations-chat 2020-12-18 04:56:27 Ah, got it.
creations-chat 2020-12-18 04:59:12 Thank you.
creations-chat 2020-12-18 06:15:30 I know none of y‚Äôall liked this but apparently I can control crash this at under 200 knots with my entire rear end ripped off
creations-chat 2020-12-18 06:23:03 Nah, I‚Äôm not sure on how to do that, any pointers?
creations-chat 2021-01-25 05:48:13 It just looks thin
creations-chat 2021-01-25 05:50:15 Still It kinda just doesn‚Äôt look right for some reason imo
creations-chat 2021-01-25 14:12:29 tbh i was expecting downvotes, its better than how it looks ngl
creations-chat 2021-01-25 14:19:06 any feedback to those who don't like my build? If you can even call it a build, more of a gadget than anything.
creations-chat 2021-01-25 14:22:57 Mm.
creations-chat 2021-01-25 14:31:08 You can make it look like a cool display case with a train in it like some of the restaurants have
creations-chat 2021-01-25 14:43:14 If you do that it's an upvote from me :)
creations-chat 2021-01-25 14:46:36 Just make it a glass box, texture it up, put some wood around the case, and boom.
creations-chat 2021-01-25 14:52:47 LOL
creations-chat 2021-01-25 15:43:01 Ayyy nice!

creations-chat 2021-01-25 16:36:54 So you know that net contraption i made that everyone hated
creations-chat 2021-01-25 16:38:57 turns out it can take down a boeing if you place it on a wing the right way, and its great for ships and cars too, the cars like flip and stuff because the net gets caught in their wheels lmao

creations-chat 2021-02-20 17:16:27 I might try to dabble a little bit in naval
creations-chat 2021-02-20 17:18:43 I heard somethings are a pain though like balance and such, but I‚Äôve seen some things like cameras can help with that
creations-chat 2021-02-20 17:20:46 And I‚Äôm also interested in interior design and such so it‚Äôll be fun either way. Because some planes are just too small to do that with.

creations-chat 2021-03-20 15:38:31 <@!596386059986927647> It looks interesting, but it kinda looks like a tutorial
creations-chat 2021-03-20 15:40:32 It looks like you followed a helicopter tutorial imo
creations-chat 2021-04-02 19:03:42 I like it man, the intakes are a bit small, but with enough practice you can do it!

Dude the A-10 is so shit and would cost almost nothing to replace, multiple fighters exist and so to bombs, if anything, the upkeep cost of A-10s as well as maintenance is probably costing America more than switching or just decommissioning the A10
creations-chat 2022-08-18 05:28:36 ‚ÄúOh look it‚Äôs a flying boat I sure hope it doesn‚Äôt get taken out of the sky in seconds!!! Omg funny gun meme!!‚Äù

creations-chat 2022-08-18 05:31:27 I don‚Äôt, the thing can‚Äôt be used in any combat scenario nowadays besides when the US has complete air superiority, or if there‚Äôs no proper anti-air
creations-chat 2022-08-18 05:34:23 You‚Äôre calling it specialized when all it‚Äôll be good at in a battlefield going forward is die
creations-chat 2022-08-18 05:38:05 Nah just read, I meant to say:  from now on, the A-10 is gonna start rotting, and if it ever sees combat again, it‚Äôs just gonna do nothing but die
