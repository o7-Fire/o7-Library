The Tale of iamdohnut (843460060725641246)
help 2023-07-04 23:19:23 any clue on what to do?
help 2023-07-04 23:19:49 so, essentially, I wanted to build this sort of station thing, and I wanted to add a plane that I could fly to it
and the plane's main issue is that, lifting and going down are fine
but it doesn't turn, and it constantly leans to one side, even after setting a manual turning system
when I move the cursor to the right, all of the wings go down
when I move it to the left, all the wings go up

help 2023-07-04 23:22:20 Back fin isn't turning due to turning it off for keyboard controls btw
help 2023-07-04 23:23:16 Mouse controls, yea.
help 2023-07-04 23:23:30 I tried it with keyboard and it felt too clunky for my poor motor skilled hands
help 2023-07-04 23:25:37 this is a single plane
help 2023-07-04 23:25:45 every other mouse controlled plane has been fine
help 2023-07-04 23:25:47 it's just this one
help 2023-07-04 23:26:05 no the fuck it ain't
help 2023-07-04 23:26:11 look at them closer
help 2023-07-04 23:26:25 it shouldn't do that, though
help 2023-07-04 23:26:36 the plane is already separated from the building
help 2023-07-04 23:26:40 it should have it's own balance
help 2023-07-04 23:26:43 right?!
help 2023-07-04 23:27:37 that's dumb
help 2023-07-04 23:28:49 no?
help 2023-07-04 23:28:53 one side is supposed to go down
help 2023-07-04 23:28:57 the other one goes up
help 2023-07-04 23:29:03 not both sides
help 2023-07-04 23:29:36 my plane shouldn't be nosediving if I wanna turn right
help 2023-07-04 23:29:38 that's not how it works
help 2023-07-04 23:29:47 well take a look dipshit
help 2023-07-04 23:29:53 they are the control surfaces
help 2023-07-04 23:30:04 one's goes down, one goes up
help 2023-07-04 23:30:13 to turn, one goes down, the other goes up
help 2023-07-04 23:30:18 they don't all go at the same time
help 2023-07-04 23:30:45 okay then dumbass
help 2023-07-04 23:31:49 liar
help 2023-07-04 23:32:27 the exact same plane in a different build. block for block
help 2023-07-04 23:32:32 and look what's going on; THE WINGS ARE ROLLING
help 2023-07-04 23:33:10 why the absolute fuck does that matter?! the plane is separate from the building it's in, why should that matter?!
help 2023-07-04 23:33:33 I've been going at this fucking thing for two hours
help 2023-07-04 23:34:13 never learnt how to use it
help 2023-07-04 23:34:22 I'm a fuckin boomer when it comes to this game
help 2023-07-04 23:34:43 also, just a heads up.
help 2023-07-04 23:35:12 I've been playing since 2010
help 2023-07-04 23:35:23 a violently autistic man-child, is who.
help 2023-07-04 23:35:27 19
help 2023-07-04 23:35:39 but I shall repeat
help 2023-07-04 23:35:42 *violently autistic*
help 2023-07-04 23:35:58 I was coddled for 1/3 of my life full chris-chan style so IDK how to emotion properly
help 2023-07-04 23:36:17 the plane I'm working with is a slightly altered tutorial plane
help 2023-07-04 23:36:20 I still just
help 2023-07-04 23:36:24 why does it do that
help 2023-07-04 23:37:02 when I say "violently autistic" I don't mean "violent and autistic" I mean "so autistic it causes psychic damage."
help 2023-07-04 23:37:20 the yellow and the blue don't align AT ALL
help 2023-07-04 23:37:27 but surely that shouldn't matter when the build is
help 2023-07-04 23:37:28 y'know
help 2023-07-04 23:37:32 *in the air*
help 2023-07-04 23:37:55 it's connected to a disconnector
help 2023-07-04 23:38:18 that's bullshit, man. <:hahaa:773727260539617280>
help 2023-07-04 23:38:52 already did earlier
help 2023-07-04 23:39:12 it's the exact same fuckin plane
help 2023-07-04 23:39:20 except one's in a building, one's on a square.
help 2023-07-04 23:39:53 SHOW ME HOW TO FUCKIN SCREEN RECORD AND I WILL
help 2023-07-04 23:41:26 if we're going by urban dictionary, then by technicalities, I am an "unde" or whatever tf that is.
help 2023-07-04 23:41:31 since it does say
help 2023-07-04 23:41:34 "extreme man-child"
help 2023-07-04 23:41:42 which definitely defines me
help 2023-07-04 23:41:52 in that case, no
help 2023-07-04 23:41:56 not an unde
help 2023-07-04 23:42:12 I'm a __man__-child
help 2023-07-04 23:42:29 coddled
help 2023-07-04 23:42:32 he spelt it weird
help 2023-07-04 23:42:40 soell
help 2023-07-04 23:42:50 ü§ù
help 2023-07-04 23:43:03 either way, though
help 2023-07-04 23:43:22 it's kinda dumb that the plane has to be centered if it's actually, y'know, not attached to the build.
help 2023-07-04 23:43:33 any suggestions to fix it? or..
help 2023-07-04 23:44:02 oop found the record button
help 2023-07-04 23:44:04 1 sec then lads
help 2023-07-04 23:44:19 so for the video, I'm going to attempt to go up, and then turn right.
help 2023-07-04 23:45:41 cringe ass motherfucker <:KEKW:670310537300672528>

help 2023-07-04 23:49:43 nope. I went straight right
help 2023-07-04 23:50:42 well you absolute waste of oxygen
help 2023-07-04 23:50:44 as I said before
help 2023-07-04 23:50:49 moving the mouse to the right
help 2023-07-04 23:50:53 makes it lift
help 2023-07-04 23:50:56 moving it to the left
help 2023-07-04 23:50:58 makes it go down
help 2023-07-04 23:51:11 it is not curving
help 2023-07-04 23:51:20 look
help 2023-07-04 23:51:20 I'm not fucking good at remembering this
help 2023-07-04 23:51:28 if you really think you're smarter than me about this
help 2023-07-04 23:51:31 then fucking fix it
help 2023-07-04 23:53:51 what if I told you that at 30 seconds in, I was trying to turn left
help 2023-07-04 23:54:10 it doesn't fucking matter, so are you going to help me fix this damned thing?
help 2023-07-04 23:54:18 turning left makes me go up
help 2023-07-04 23:54:21 turning right makes me go down
help 2023-07-04 23:54:29 turning up makes me go up
help 2023-07-04 23:54:37 turning down makes me go down
help 2023-07-04 23:54:48 the plane isn't connected at all to the building
help 2023-07-04 23:55:24 it ain't rolling it's throwing me down
help 2023-07-04 23:55:26 rolling means
help 2023-07-04 23:55:28 one side up
help 2023-07-04 23:55:29 other side down
help 2023-07-04 23:55:35 on this damned plane
help 2023-07-04 23:55:41 left is up
help 2023-07-04 23:55:43 right is down
help 2023-07-04 23:55:54 I'm tired of fucking arguing this
help 2023-07-04 23:56:08 how many times do I have to say it to drill it into your concrete skulls?
help 2023-07-04 23:57:01 flipped the control surfaces
help 2023-07-04 23:57:02 same
help 2023-07-04 23:57:03 fucking
help 2023-07-04 23:57:04 thing
help 2023-07-04 23:57:06 left is up
help 2023-07-04 23:57:08 right is nothing
help 2023-07-04 23:57:45 I tried building the plane up here and the mouse controls just straight up didn't fucking work
help 2023-07-04 23:58:27 you've gotta be fucking kidding me
help 2023-07-04 23:58:31 found out the issue
help 2023-07-04 23:58:39 and it's because that fucking yellow dot isn't where the plane is
help 2023-07-04 23:58:56 no no
help 2023-07-04 23:58:57 that is
help 2023-07-04 23:59:20 I placed a fucking control panel on the right side of the building
help 2023-07-04 23:59:30 when I moved it right
help 2023-07-04 23:59:38 the wing panels on the plane went down
help 2023-07-04 23:59:42 the one on the building went right
help 2023-07-05 00:00:03 on the plane itself
help 2023-07-05 00:00:05 have you
help 2023-07-05 00:00:14 not been staring at the screenshots AT ALL?
help 2023-07-05 00:00:42 how the crap do I fix this without scrapping the building or the plane? helium and ballast blocks on the plane aren't working
help 2023-07-05 00:00:53 or should I just give up with the plane idea
help 2023-07-05 00:04:23 honestly
help 2023-07-05 00:04:26 I'm just gonna give up
help 2023-07-05 00:04:29 I'm tired of all of this
help 2023-07-05 00:04:35 and I just want something to work for once
help 2023-07-05 00:04:53 all I wanted was to just create a building that could fire things and shoot out a drone, but alas.
help 2023-07-05 00:06:04 I did rebuild the plane
help 2023-07-05 00:06:05 thrice
help 2023-07-05 00:06:24 
help 2023-07-05 00:06:30 to hold guns, duh
help 2023-07-05 00:06:40 guns don't look right attached to wings
help 2023-07-05 00:07:24 whatever it is, it didn't fix the plane.
help 2023-07-05 00:08:45 so wtf do I do
help 2023-07-05 00:09:08 I REMOVED THE BLOCKS AND IT DID THE SAME FUCKING THING
help 2023-07-05 00:09:14 I KNOW what I'm on about
help 2023-07-05 00:09:18 I know what the problem is
help 2023-07-05 00:09:24 what in sam hell is the solution?
help 2023-07-05 00:10:35 it's not the plane
help 2023-07-05 00:10:43 I have the exact same plane
help 2023-07-05 00:10:45 in a different build
help 2023-07-05 00:12:25 too much hassle, but look.
help 2023-07-05 00:12:29 it's built slightly different
help 2023-07-05 00:12:35 but it's the same fuckin plane
help 2023-07-05 00:12:53 not now matat
help 2023-07-05 00:12:54 fuck off
help 2023-07-05 00:14:42 I hope your closest family member dies on christmas eve with you as the sole culprit
help 2023-07-05 00:15:26 I'm just fucking tired of all of this
help 2023-07-05 00:15:46 I'm trying to get this stupid fucking thing to work, but it's not working.
help 2023-07-05 00:19:08 IK it works fine
help 2023-07-05 00:19:12 it's because of the balls
help 2023-07-05 00:19:20 have you seen the balls

help 2023-07-05 00:21:36 we know the problem
help 2023-07-05 00:21:40 it's because of the fucking building
help 2023-07-05 00:21:42 how do we fix it
help 2023-07-05 00:21:50 because using QA-ED controls is fucking awful
help 2023-07-05 00:23:07 man this shit just hurts

help 2023-07-05 00:25:07 as the saying goes
help 2023-07-05 00:25:11 dipshits don't fly
help 2023-07-05 00:26:27 man not even a car will work
help 2023-07-05 00:26:32 wtf do I put in the garage area
help 2023-07-05 00:26:40 tired of building boats

help 2023-07-05 00:27:31 it just made me sad and feel worthless
help 2023-07-05 00:28:12 I am not taking a break until I build something that I want to build that works!
help 2023-07-05 00:31:34 fuck off and fuck you, I'm not leaving until I do something I want to do, and it works.
help 2023-07-05 00:51:53 and do that I did, I made a small car with a turret and I love it
help 2023-07-05 00:58:35 and I'm happy, and thankful that you did!
help 2023-07-05 00:58:47 I just get a bit toddler-tantrum-y when angry
help 2023-07-05 14:28:53 if I had to guess, add some helium blocks to the top of it.
