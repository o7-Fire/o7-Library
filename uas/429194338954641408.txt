help 2020-08-10 02:39:44 Speaking of breaking the game, I had a very complex creation but had to dumb it down a lot due to springs and ropes and suspension clashing so much that my creation would freeze completely but I could still jump out of it and watch others and I had no lag or connection problems, just wondering if the issue was caused by all three together or too many of just one individually?
