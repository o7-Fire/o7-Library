creations-chat 2022-01-14 15:54:41 <@!487056388451729418> dude how did you get the afterburners on that Mig-25?
creations-chat 2022-01-14 15:58:05 I like the bow and the superstructure but I think it would look pretty cool if you make it like a destroyer escort like the John C butler class

creations-chat 2022-01-14 17:27:06 dang shipwright is really easy to get, I have like 8 ships that all fit into the categories
creations-chat 2022-01-14 17:30:15 the paint job is horrible, the turrets are decent, but I think that this thing can do very well in PVP. | wait it's decorative? legit thought the turrets held like 4 missiles each | shows that the paint job is so bad that I can't even see if it clearly has PVP stuff lol
creations-chat 2022-01-14 17:35:43 how do you guys do the stacking sentences? like making it all stack vertically <@!739369649971527720> camo is really nice, though the turrets are kinda lacking *and the bow
creations-chat 2022-01-14 17:42:29 how's my kamoz Ka-41? 
I'm trying to make it like an osprey + Mi-24 but I'm having problems with the painting and balancing because I don't know what camo I should use
creations-chat 2022-01-14 17:51:30 can someone send me a pic of thatHornet?  
Hornet looks good and better than what I could make but not enough for HoF
creations-chat 2022-01-14 17:55:06 Is my camo for my helicopter good?
I'm not good with camos at all
<@!714878625484243101> alright
<@!725358947904651335> I'm going for a Mi-24 style of camo
creations-chat 2022-01-14 17:58:01 something that looks like this <@!725358947904651335> It's my first time doing this camo and I don't typically paint my creations
creations-chat 2022-01-14 18:01:06 looks real nice, if you're adding turrets what would it be? I'm thinking of Fletcher class style of turrets
creations-chat 2022-01-14 18:05:30 is this considered overlocking? because I think it is
creations-chat 2022-01-14 18:10:31 I mean this is how big my helicopter is
forgot to send the picture
creations-chat 2022-01-14 18:13:06 so here's my helicopter
I don't know if something this big would be considered over locking
creations-chat 2022-01-14 18:15:42 I think it could be an issue because then, you take up more space for motor towers and cause more lag for something that can be achieve with less blocks
creations-chat 2022-01-14 18:19:01 ayo I was just testing my helicopter's controls and one guy joined and had a big ghost galleon
creations-chat 2022-01-14 18:22:11 is it possible for you to make it like this?
like Fletcher class style of turrets
creations-chat 2022-01-14 18:28:31 you can
you just copy the base of the turret like 20 blocks upwards and find a way to make it move to the middle
creations-chat 2022-01-14 18:37:36 looks really nice, can I see what you're best build is right now? <@!469528043850039296> same bro

creations-chat 2022-01-14 23:49:27 dang you really went all out on the rating
creations-chat 2022-01-14 23:58:14 it looks good but not accurate to a real phantom
creations-chat 2022-01-15 00:06:57 here's what an F4 phantom nose looks like
creations-chat 2022-01-15 00:09:30 truly
creations-chat 2022-01-15 00:12:53 *most accurate right now
creations-chat 2022-01-15 00:15:43 the one block wide part is the minigun hold and yeah it looks bad
creations-chat 2022-01-15 00:18:20 it was supposed to be the F variant and I made the nose a bit short 😦
I'm trying to look at it right now but roblox keeps making me disconnect every 5 minutes
creations-chat 2022-01-15 00:21:14 here's the nose at another angle
I want to but I can't because internet is breaking
also I think I found out why it's so short because I made it a year ago and wanted it to be 1:1 scale
creations-chat 2022-01-15 00:24:33 I don';t think I can even do that without causing more exposed locks, the ones in the air intake are for the angle of the wings
my phantom is essentially spaghetti code now
help 2022-01-15 00:25:33 uh oh
creations-chat 2022-01-15 00:39:18 what's that

I MADE THE PBY 2 YEARS AGO WITH LIKE 2 MOTORS FOR MOTOR LOCK
creations-chat 2022-01-15 15:48:18 no wonder why, they dislike every average builds but like good builds with almost no dislikes

average builds always get a 1/3 like to dislike ratio while good builds have 80/1 like to dislike ratio
creations-chat 2022-01-15 15:58:31 I figured it was the paint but I can't do good camos for some reason

creations-chat 2022-01-23 04:20:37 I really like these battles that I make with microsoft paint
So I got an idea of making something like a big explosion when the ammo rack explodes in paint 3d.

creations-chat 2022-01-23 05:13:05 I think you should add like a big air intake ontop of the hood
creations-chat 2022-01-23 05:19:17 oh, probably to the side at like an angle above the wheels
creations-chat 2022-01-23 15:46:39 I suck at making plane pictures lol
I'm gonna stick with warships sinking with the boom and flames

<@456226577798135808> I know but the plane is pretty much lost because that was when I made motor lock planes pretty bad.
creations-chat 2022-01-23 16:07:36 I'm sure you can see it clearly
creations-chat 2022-01-23 16:11:55 I'll try but I only use paint 3d and I don't think I can reverse much of it

I can reverse the filters and I'll try to reverse and revise it

creations-chat 2022-01-23 19:45:31 how do I improve on this?
creations-chat 2022-01-23 19:51:20 you know that flash suits prevent people from getting on fire from the sparks of a gun?
that's one of the reasons how the battle of jutland caused the british to lose many of their ships because they didn't wear flash suits, causing the sparks to ignite the ammunition
<@!460531752033845258> it's the best word I can use but if you got anything better, I'll change it
creations-chat 2022-01-23 19:54:30 stuff like court marshalling

<@!460531752033845258> no I mean like if they're caught in the turrets without a flash suit, they get punished
sort of like if you break a bunch of rules that are for your safety, you'll still get punished
oh ok
creations-chat 2022-01-23 19:59:30 big covenent ship
creations-chat 2022-01-23 20:24:56 I know that the ships were definitely undetailed and old but those were the only finished ships I had that was sundan navy
creations-chat 2022-01-23 20:30:29 Understandable,
The first carrier was made in less than a day and very rushed, the second carrier was the oldest ship out of all of them so you can see the god awful paint scheme.
The light cruiser is the only one that I can get the commitment to fix and add an interior, but the deck sits very low in the water so I'll have to fix a few things before making an interior.

creations-chat 2022-01-24 00:23:23 did you ever think of being able to just punch or puncture light tank armour if you had a pickaxe or something?
early light tank armour was like 10mm lol
creations-chat 2022-01-24 00:26:41 well yeah, but 10mm is 1cm and 1cm is pretty small
like 1cm is about the size of this [][][]
and I sometime think that if a tankette or something goes on very uneven ground, is it possible for the thing to just have it's body slant and stuff?
creations-chat 2022-01-24 00:33:25 well most pickaxes have a pointed end like this

creations-chat 2022-06-03 03:52:11 most people don't know how big an F4 phantom is, legit it's bigger than a B-25 Mitchell medium bomber in terms of length

mine is ugly as hell but the size is somewhat accurate
looks like I made the width too fat
but the length is better

creations-chat 2022-06-05 03:39:01 two terrible photos, but my F4 phantom has more accurate scale on the actual one
I don't get why roscalers make the F4 so small
creations-chat 2022-06-05 03:45:11 I saw it too and my F4 phantom definitely is fatter, but I think the length and cockpit width on most roscale F4 phantoms are lacking

I saw someone say his F4 phantom is roscale, but the fuselage and air intakes are too thin, I'm saying like 2 blocks total wide
creations-chat 2022-06-05 03:47:33 most western MBTs look like that, like the Leopard 2A4 and Type 90

creations-chat 2022-06-09 18:06:25 sweet mother of god what the hell is that rudder
creations-chat 2022-06-09 18:08:27 atleast the jet can VTOL and has the correct landing gear on the fuselage, nothing else to say about it positively after that
creations-chat 2022-06-09 18:10:50 very old harriers but still, they look worse

creations-chat 2022-06-09 18:12:55 he said nothing about how old the harrier could be <:trollface:775024642104229898>

also <@845396941373833226> , harrier works good but man could it use something to atleast make it look better
creations-chat 2022-06-09 18:19:03 that's why I like everything other than terrible builds that don't have a lot of effort put into them

https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/384025409945337856/984506422895214653/unknown.png

creations-chat 2022-06-26 20:00:53 He has a point though
creations-chat 2022-06-26 20:06:00 No, his point is that you cannot say "That F-15 is utter disappointment and you should delete it", it is not proper criticism. Even if it is to you, it doesn't help the person who made the build in any real way, saying stuff like "That F-15 is utter disappointment but if you fix the wings, air intakes, and the nose, it could be somewhat better" is actual criticism
creations-chat 2022-06-26 20:08:55 <@458012038594166795> holy jesus use sentences, I can't even read a damn word because all I see is creations and innovation

<@456226577798135808> With most builds beyond repair, it's often that it is someone's first time, you can't just say that their build is terrible, and leave it at that.
because then, they don't fix it because they don't know what to fix, so their builds just stay awful

creations-chat 2022-06-26 23:49:30 it isn't, I do have a ship that has details everywhere, but I don't like it as much because it lags the hell out of my PC, it takes longer to load, and doesn't look as good compared to another ship I made

creations-chat 2022-06-27 19:41:25 Amethyst is cool but seeing amethysts in geodes remind me of how snot crystalizes in the nose, it's weird I know

<@652968737485357056> but you can use jade in jewelry too
creations-chat 2022-06-27 19:44:18 Though yes, emeralds are more shiny, jade is cooler because you don't have to cut at a precise angle

Like cutting an emerald into a cube will make it very weak, but you can do the same with jade and it will stay the same

creations-chat 2022-07-22 01:54:29 Pickles and tomatoes on hamburgers 🤢
creations-chat 2022-07-22 01:56:38 Pickles are too sour for hamburgers, and they're really only two slices so you're eating those slices on at a time instead of a small bite when you're eating a burger
Tomatoes are too sweet and tart for a hamburger along with the fact that it's largely made out of water so when you bite it, all you taste is tomato water and tartness
creations-chat 2022-07-22 01:58:43 homemade burgers is sort of an oxymoron, because when you're usually buying a burger, you have to eat it while on the go, at a job, or unable to be using a table
so when you have the time to make a burger at home, you probably wouldn't need to use it while going somewhere

creations-chat 2022-08-16 20:53:08 it's literally impossible right here, any custom landing gear would need to remove the half 1x2 wedge
creations-chat 2022-08-16 20:55:40 that only solves it partially, you need to find a way to find room in order to have the cylinder fit into the aircraft
and with the massive amount of motor lock, that would straight be impossible

creations-chat 2022-08-20 23:04:24 bro why do people like this thing
creations-chat 2022-08-20 23:06:31 <@821642310491570196> , make it 2 days
contest-chat 2022-08-20 23:06:55 😭
contest-chat 2022-08-20 23:07:00 this is already my 2nd week of school
contest-chat 2022-08-20 23:07:03 1st week started on a thursday
creations-chat 2022-08-21 19:31:45 bur kali
creations-chat 2022-08-21 19:39:03 fr didn't even try to make it mini
<@527653676022628353> grey is bland though
creations-chat 2022-08-21 19:41:41 ngl warsaw radio mast would be pretty cool, this one photo gives me the creeps for some reason
creations-chat 2022-08-21 22:42:55 it looks good but it ain't HOF quality
creations-chat 2022-08-21 23:18:48 HoF is just good big builds
creations-chat 2022-08-21 23:22:37 <@448677698773057547> other than the king tiger, I agree with you

yeah with stuff that requires folding, it's usually included with massive amounts of buildings/detail

<@821642310491570196> so you're telling me that the space shuttle is good but not amazing?
creations-chat 2022-08-21 23:25:34 Yes, the Buran itself isn't amazing but it's like saying the gun on your king tiger isn't amazing
creations-chat 2022-08-21 23:50:21 Tiger II looks nice but for so little details on a big build, I'd say it wasn't hof worthy
creations-chat 2022-08-22 20:40:25 HOW IN EVER LOVING HELL DOES THIS GET THE LIKE TO DISLIKE RATIO SO UNEVEN
DO PEOPLE NOT KNOW WHAT A PANZER III IS?
creations-chat 2022-08-22 20:44:12 TURRET ISN'T EVEN in THE CORRECT DAMN SPOT!
IT LOOKS LIKE A LAGO MORE THAN ANYTHING
creations-chat 2022-08-22 20:46:29 why is this thing liked, I normally would have liked something like this but jesus christ, atleast fix the gaps on the engine root
creations-chat 2022-08-22 20:49:16 HOW DOES THIS THING GET LESS LIKES/DISLIKE RATIO COMPARED TO THE CRAPPY PANZER III
creations-chat 2022-08-22 20:51:20 because genuinely decent builds get worse likes/dislikes ratio than a crappy panzer III with the turret in the wrong place and the Engine Cowling with baby teeth gaps
creations-chat 2022-08-22 20:55:13 even then, that many people shouldn't be liking the panzer III as much as they did
creations-chat 2022-08-22 21:07:58 how can you not say this thing is ugly and inaccurate as hell?

Red, Turret is put way too forward way too much
Orange, Panzer III's Armour is not angled at all yet on the PC one it's angled
Blue, Exposed Propeller Engines though I'll excuse that one
Purple, literally only two wheels and an exposed motor 💀
Yellow-Orange, No reason for the Rack, No reason at all
creations-chat 2022-08-22 21:10:35 Hell, the only hull that has angled armour similar to the PC panzer III is a a StuG
creations-chat 2022-08-22 21:17:24 Even if people change and that many less people are at 10 AM or 3 AM, it still doesn't matter that the Panzer III got that high of a ratio as it did, the person who made it didn't even bother with adding roadwheels and yet it still has high positive to dislike ratio
creations-chat 2022-08-22 21:20:35 For what? a demented Panzer III that looks like it came out of Hungary or Sweden instead of Germany?
creations-chat 2022-08-22 21:24:26 even if it is just a "bad" tank, I can get riled over it as it is because inherently, it is something that shouldn't be able to even get positive likes to dislike for something just mediocre
creations-chat 2022-08-22 21:30:45 the big deal is that it exists in the first place and almost no feedback other than mine and another guy's, and that I'm disappointed in it more than anything
creations-chat 2022-08-22 21:35:02 <@720937847317725195> remember the tips man, also please remove the rack on the back, it makes no sense, it has no purpose, and all it does is compromise the looks for nothing
creations-chat 2022-08-22 21:37:50 https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/829737438964351056/1011388701236023307/attachment.gif
creations-chat 2022-08-22 21:40:24 when people know that it shouldn't exist
<@803292176418078720> yeah, any of the speechbubbles I send is free for anyone to use
creations-chat 2022-08-22 21:43:32 and that saltiness is justified
creations-chat 2022-08-22 21:45:54 even if it's the guy's first build, he already shows he has the skill and power to make it better, but chooses not to before uploading
creations-chat 2022-08-22 21:48:23 as if the angle lock, motor lock, and even breaking a jet engine apart to make the gun doesn't make it anymore obvious
creations-chat 2022-08-22 21:51:19 my mom chk s my pc every daye!!!!@!!!! 😭
creations-chat 2022-08-22 21:56:51 😭😭stop swoering meanie heads!!!!!!@1$1!!
creations-chat 2022-08-22 22:00:10 sort of, also, he could have done atleast the roadwheels because what's holding up the tracks? definitely not the air
creations-chat 2022-08-22 22:03:07 yeah, and he can reset and do it over again
literally only takes 5 minutes of building and then an extra 2-3 minutes of posing
if he doesn't want to, then that's just pure laziness at it's greatest
creations-chat 2022-08-22 22:09:23 and I'm tired of trying to convince you it's a piece of crap and that you shouldn't be defending it, I'm gonna go leave too

the-dump 2022-08-23 22:16:13 yeah
the-dump 2022-08-23 22:16:17 and he said it's a panzer 3

the-dump 2022-08-23 22:51:57 TNT and a jet engine
creations-chat 2022-08-23 22:52:16 🤮
the-dump 2022-08-23 22:54:08 no idea
creations-chat 2022-08-23 22:54:31 not anymore <:clueless:942802644043464734>
creations-chat 2022-08-23 22:57:00 can bully him too hard if his Zero looks this bad (bro didn't even try to make the seat at the right area
creations-chat 2022-08-23 23:11:49 even worse (it's apparently a "panzer 3")
creations-chat 2022-08-23 23:15:06 are you supatodla14 or supatodla
help 2022-08-23 23:18:40 refer to the above
creations-chat 2022-08-23 23:23:35 why is the forehead so big on the king tiger
creations-chat 2022-08-23 23:28:20 it's the slant on the turret upf plate that's making it look weird
creations-chat 2022-08-24 00:25:06 I don't care if it was big, he put it way too far forward and then made a rack that didn't even exist in any panzer III variants
creations-chat 2022-08-24 19:55:52 Stuka looks nice and all but why the random guns and the cheese grator wings
creations-chat 2022-08-24 19:58:40 Bottom looks nicer
creations-chat 2022-08-26 01:10:03 Eggstar
creations-chat 2022-08-26 01:12:17 bro wtf is this F22 and YF23
HOW IN GOD'S NAME DOES THE YF23 HAVE 25 UPVOTES
creations-chat 2022-08-26 01:14:55 This is the fall of creations, we need double and ritual back
creations-chat 2022-08-26 01:17:42 Ritual sucks with his F-14 but atleast he gave decent criticism
creations-chat 2022-08-26 01:24:14 
creations-chat 2022-08-26 01:28:12 only thing need to be said about the current state of the PCC creations standards
creations-chat 2022-08-26 01:32:27 1, Frontal Armour that is flat and where the bow machine gun is, is angled where in reality wasn't even angled 15 degrees.
2, Turret is placed way too far forward, and the Rack that's placed on top of the engine deck is nonexistent in ALL variants of the Panzer III and the guy added it for no other reason than why not.
3, Creator posted the Tank with only two wheels, and when someone pointed it out, he said he was too lazy to do it.
4, There are two propeller engines straight up jutting from the front of the tank, and the guy who made it did no attempt to hide it other than the colour.
creations-chat 2022-08-26 01:34:44 Angled Armour is *very* easy to fix and only needs the replacement of three blocks, that's it, three blocks
creations-chat 2022-08-26 01:36:47 Lets also talk about how the UPF and LPF literally juts out from the tracks
easy fix too, just remove the front 3 half blocks and you already fixed it
contest-chat 2022-08-26 01:38:37 <@999599719275823134> I highly suggest you use custom colours other than the prebuilt orange and yellow
creations-chat 2022-08-26 01:40:05 This Rack thing didn't even exist on ALL variants of the panzer 3
creations-chat 2022-08-26 01:44:29 
creations-chat 2022-08-27 01:19:34 <@695804183500161065> no way is it the rea jiammy
creations-chat 2022-08-27 15:14:04 🥵
creations-chat 2022-08-27 16:08:46 just use propeller engines instead to control the balance
creations-chat 2022-08-28 23:26:19 supersonic coal jet 😎
creations-chat 2022-08-29 20:50:37 how the hell...
creations-chat 2022-08-29 21:02:52 yeah, literally just one or two motor towers with tow fuselages
creations-chat 2022-08-31 23:30:00 respectively, what the hell is with the piston engines
creations-chat 2022-08-31 23:32:21 jesus christ what the hell... the propeller isn't even properly painted

creations-chat 2022-09-02 20:25:10 it's cute yeah but this is more than sub par lmao, the only redeeming factor is the cockpit and even then, it's not that crazy
creations-chat 2022-09-02 21:18:48 upscale the fuselage and wing length, keep the wing thickness the same and make the guns not be too far up
creations-chat 2022-09-03 17:00:47 
creations-chat 2022-09-03 17:02:50 semi crappy plane gets 90 to 16 ratio, krm defends it by saying it's cute, goes on to say this tank is poop even though it has more effort with the motor locking hiding
