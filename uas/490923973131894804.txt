the-dump 2021-07-26 04:02:39 Build a Boat is a better game for building

*but after that, you leave these ships to rot since theres no pvp system* <:crazylaughzeg:764919988468973599>

creations-chat 2021-12-26 04:38:23 Me sipping cocoa while I watch these blatant lies

***satisfaction***
creations-chat 2021-12-26 04:41:17 Send me critical analyses of Build a Boat for Treasure, and I‚Äôll send,

Also the straws were for mixing, not that much of a masochist^^‚Ä¶
creations-chat 2021-12-26 04:47:29 Was asking the first question to someone else who wanted the cocoa lol

Was at a restaurant, so just used a straw for convenience

As for BABFT, I‚Äôm (ig an hr) an would like opinions from a similar game
creations-chat 2021-12-26 04:52:36 I‚Äôm an hr, ig since we don‚Äôt use that term really, I‚Äôm a mod for babft, and for the hot cocoa *I elaborate* I used a straw because it was closest to the styrofoam cups,
creations-chat 2021-12-26 05:09:57 I see^^‚Ä¶ and what are your thoughts about babft as a game? Just me personally asking people from other similar games to see what we could improve on 

Ik a lot about the paywall already as a main complaint lol

the-dump 2022-01-01 03:52:51 Most of our server would be banned for breaking the under 13 tod
the-dump 2022-01-01 03:52:53 Tos
the-dump 2022-01-01 03:53:01 Its for their mental insecurity
the-dump 2022-01-01 03:54:10 Nope, if theres an argument it lasts a long ling tune
the-dump 2022-01-01 03:54:12 Time
the-dump 2022-01-01 03:55:10 If theres an argument
the-dump 2022-01-01 03:55:19 It has to be done cleanly
the-dump 2022-01-01 03:55:25 Meaning no cursing
the-dump 2022-01-01 03:56:08 Even our hall of fame staff fights lasts weeks

the-dump 2022-01-01 03:59:09 But it could prosper if we had a dedicate creations feedback channel
the-dump 2022-01-01 03:59:16 Or a babft topic channel
the-dump 2022-01-01 03:59:25 Like I said, our actives no longer play babft

creations-chat 2022-01-01 04:08:50 What if I send babft creation to <#384025409945337856> ??
the-dump 2022-01-01 04:11:11 I‚Äôm seeing how we square up
the-dump 2022-01-01 04:11:54 95% of ppl who play babft are 9 year olds
the-dump 2022-01-01 04:12:19 If you can get that into your skull, you‚Äôll understand why our pro to noob population gap is massive
creations-chat 2022-01-01 04:16:18 I‚Äôm confused as well

the-dump 2022-01-25 04:54:45 
the-dump 2022-01-25 04:55:04 Ignore flying tank
the-dump 2022-01-25 04:55:12 Ground backgrounds are not my forte
the-dump 2022-01-25 04:55:25 I can beat any ship or aircraft however
the-dump 2022-01-25 04:55:56 Mine is only ‚Äúcompetitive‚Äù
the-dump 2022-01-25 04:56:01 No where near best
the-dump 2022-01-25 04:57:38 
the-dump 2022-01-25 04:57:51 Most recent build yes
the-dump 2022-01-25 04:58:18 Its just the grind
the-dump 2022-01-25 04:58:28 I payed nothing to get where I am today

the-dump 2022-01-25 05:01:26 Aesthetics yes
the-dump 2022-01-25 05:01:40 If thats unanchored, would crash the server
the-dump 2022-01-25 05:02:01 Their merkava is made really well
the-dump 2022-01-25 05:02:28 *doubt*
the-dump 2022-01-25 05:02:40 Plane crazy has its own charm
the-dump 2022-01-25 05:02:49 We can just use studio f3x
the-dump 2022-01-25 05:03:37 Pc s post build implementation is amazing
the-dump 2022-01-25 05:03:52 In babft, we can‚Äôt do anything with out builds after its done
the-dump 2022-01-25 05:04:11 Its like spend 3 months building, finish, dont touch again
the-dump 2022-01-25 05:04:18 Our pvp mechanics are abhorrent
the-dump 2022-01-25 05:04:51 Our jet turbines can outrun our only cannons
the-dump 2022-01-25 05:04:58 We do?
the-dump 2022-01-25 05:05:05 A lot
the-dump 2022-01-25 05:05:09 You get 3 free
the-dump 2022-01-25 05:05:13 Menu
the-dump 2022-01-25 05:05:24 You can have up to 100 I believe
the-dump 2022-01-25 05:05:27 3 free
the-dump 2022-01-25 05:05:35 Others unlock with gold
the-dump 2022-01-25 05:05:38 Or robux
the-dump 2022-01-25 05:05:53 I just cram 5 ships in a single slot
the-dump 2022-01-25 05:06:08 Just leave the afk grinder on overnight
creations-chat 2022-04-08 22:23:54 I don‚Äôt get motorlocking babft player btw
Its like saying blocky<microblock different ppl, different styles
creations-chat 2022-04-08 22:30:11 Will PC2 add rotations? Similar to F3X
creations-chat 2022-04-08 22:31:54 For gods sake, stop you two, next topic
Will PC2 have more F3X features? Or is nothing really released yet


<@!793132196810588200> I‚Äôm asking a question?‚Ä¶
creations-chat 2022-04-08 22:36:33 Will PC2 keep on relying on motorlocks? Or will rotations be added

the-dump 2023-01-17 03:16:41 
the-dump 2023-01-17 03:18:09 Agreed
the-dump 2023-01-17 03:18:19 We also have a community of less toxic people
the-dump 2023-01-17 03:18:34 The people here are like xbox kids
the-dump 2023-01-17 03:18:50 I play on iPad
the-dump 2023-01-17 03:21:07 But we can build better
the-dump 2023-01-17 03:21:19 I don‚Äôt know why you hate the game so much
the-dump 2023-01-17 03:21:29 They‚Äôre too different
the-dump 2023-01-17 03:22:00 Watch this, I‚Äôm going to upset the status quo by posting babft in <#384021699466756107>

the-dump 2023-01-17 03:48:01 I‚Äôm in a babft military server
the-dump 2023-01-17 03:48:08 So the entire community makes great stuff
the-dump 2023-01-17 03:48:29 Lol, the grind takes a while
the-dump 2023-01-17 03:48:32 But after that
the-dump 2023-01-17 03:48:35 So worth it
the-dump 2023-01-17 03:49:32 We cant do that
the-dump 2023-01-17 03:49:39 Exploiters run amok
the-dump 2023-01-17 03:49:49 All the good builders stay in vip servers
the-dump 2023-01-17 03:50:31 Top 1% never go outside of vip servers if theyre building
the-dump 2023-01-17 03:51:06 They copy builds
the-dump 2023-01-17 03:51:13 Theft of intellectual property
the-dump 2023-01-17 03:51:16 Theyre everywhere
the-dump 2023-01-17 03:51:27 Huge issue, no ingame mods tho
