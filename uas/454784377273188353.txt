the-dump 2020-09-02 18:56:42 Does anyone wanna hear a bedtime story. Ok so once a pig was walking through the forest. A giant Barack Obama came and picked him up and threw him across the forest to where Donald Trump was and they played catch until the pig threw up on Donald Trump and he fell in a 6ft hole. Good night.
