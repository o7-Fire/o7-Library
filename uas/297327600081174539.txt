creations-chat 2019-01-07 22:11:38 mb
creations-chat 2019-01-07 22:11:38 well it is the space shuttle
creations-chat 2019-01-07 22:12:10 btw how do I suggest something
creations-chat 2019-01-07 22:12:12 do I just type it?
creations-chat 2019-01-09 18:00:58 the anime thing is good btw
creations-chat 2019-01-16 14:59:29 So first of all, yes, this is the F-16 most of you may know from youtube, but the only thing I copied is the shape since I'm not really good with the shapes for planes, everything else is changed and modified by me, the back wings have motors that can move them and changes the way the plane flys mid air, it has vertical landing and veritcal takeoff, and a few other things I added. (Don't start saying oh u copied this from youtube cause I literally said it at the beginning)
creations-chat 2019-01-16 15:01:06 welp here we start
creations-chat 2019-01-16 15:01:40 most people do know it so I mentioned that
creations-chat 2019-01-16 15:27:48 <@427466925275217931> I dont even think you read what I said lmao, I love how you say "slightly", like, the only thing I took from the vid is the shape of the plane, literally everything else about it is different made by me and I added other stuff to, so I guess that's slightly huh?
creations-chat 2019-01-18 15:28:03 This is my Boeing 747, not the best but I tried, and it the front gear and back gears are all just like irl. (The 2 little blocks on the bottom in the middle are so it it holds the plane up when I launch so the gear can get in place)
creations-chat 2019-01-19 09:32:06 My version of the F-22 Raptor, with the back wings that can move to change the way it flies mid air, and vertical takeoff/landing.
creations-chat 2019-01-20 14:22:59 its not stupid if it works
creations-chat 2019-01-21 17:20:09 F-22 Raptor, I added bombs to it, and missles (has vertical takeoff/landing, and the back wings can move so the jet can change the way it flies midair)
creations-chat 2019-01-21 17:20:47 Lights off

creations-chat 2019-03-29 20:11:14 Boeing 737, first Boeing I've ever made, surprisingly flies, and I still need to move and make the wings a bit longer, and a few other stuff, but rest I just wanted to put my progress out. Tell me what you think.
creations-chat 2019-03-29 20:13:01 i based it off cargo boeing 737 not the transport one
