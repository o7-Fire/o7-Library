creations-chat 2022-12-24 06:52:42 <@1002450692969070633> why did you go on a rampage? did you experience some unequality here or did you just wake up and decided that its trolling time?

Cool build and all but the wings look like this (not like it matters that much bc its really minor)
creations-chat 2022-12-25 18:43:56 Vip 1 wot that?
creations-chat 2022-12-25 19:25:54 What a Nice mig-29 Ive been doing lately. Hopefully nobody looks under it <:clueless:942802644043464734> didnt mean to reply to you it was set as replied from before and I didnt remove it cus I didnt notice it sorry
creations-chat 2022-12-25 20:47:37 it looks really nice and it has nice detail with some minor "pro gaming" but like It looks like f-25 (f-35 and f-22 mix up if you would put in a "noob" cockpit
to add more to it it has some really cool things like the custom engine intake and the rear end but then like the rest is made with like just super glueing stuff into it and not a lot of thought
creations-chat 2022-12-25 20:50:32 well that one wasnt exactly "roscale" I fixed it to be more accurately sized but like I personally like making 2 wide's so much more than 1 wide or 3-10b wide
creations-chat 2022-12-25 20:53:23 this is actually false because by cnp'ing the cockpit next to each other in stuff like paint I get similiar length results in cockpits as I get with blueprint its not 1:1 but more like 1,1:1,05 ish
creations-chat 2022-12-25 20:57:25 because the perspective fucked it somewhat up in that picture also why did I take those pictures so far away? idk why tbh
creations-chat 2022-12-25 20:59:27 oh my god you have enlighten me by a lot thank you for correcting me bro what was I thinking (oh well cant be assed to give a fug) just think of this as a idfk a "plushie jet" or some shiz

creations-chat 2023-01-02 13:57:28 like I can see why but I just see those images as like hella hilarious
creations-chat 2023-01-02 21:04:56 "im not that good"
 also the "im not that good" dudes details
(and yeah I understand you didnt say "you are not that good" just using you as a example to point out about those people who do say that)
creations-chat 2023-01-03 12:10:14 its more of a people over hyping buildings that tbh arent that great
Example: https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/384025409945337856/1059707265537540159

creations-chat 2023-01-03 12:23:45 fr like tf actually
creations-chat 2023-01-07 07:14:42 so I finally learned what I have been doing wrong while angle locking so decided to start doing a A-10 is this build ok?
creations-chat 2023-01-07 08:22:18 Bro I looked up pictures of F-16 to compare for the image on the bottom and found the image on top pretty high up
creations-chat 2023-01-07 08:57:57 yes I think that thing will fly worse than a boulder with all taht shiz
creations-chat 2023-01-07 09:00:00 yes
creations-chat 2023-01-07 09:04:54 yeah but lets focus on the point "why the long face" <@706717603258957864> (pls answer bc thats a bit too long)
creations-chat 2023-01-07 09:09:03 it just looks longer with the referene image
creations-chat 2023-01-07 09:12:44 my own take on this is while I have a bad habit of making my planes too short you have a habit of making them too fucking long
creations-chat 2023-01-07 09:31:43 if thats flat then jesus maybe planet earth is flat after all

creations-chat 2023-01-07 10:37:27 aight thanks for explaining
creations-chat 2023-01-07 10:41:59 I see. I really never looked for tutorials and instead learned like 50% of the things I use in my builds by improving to my own liking or replicating things ive seen other people use and the same happened with the cockpit

creations-chat 2023-01-07 12:26:58 Bro zoom in its finnish flag + bc im from finland so I want to add the flag there to show my nationality on my build just for the extra bit of spice
creations-chat 2023-01-07 17:42:20 1. yes I build that backwards 2. A bit rude of ye to gang up and shit on the build and 3. I got advice on why the build looks like shit and have improved upon it (its still not great its just now that class where it would get a 1:2 ratio on downvotes over upvotes
creations-chat 2023-01-07 17:44:53 well I am aware of that point and I knew my build is seen as dog shit here but I posted anyways because I want to improve and I got the advice on how to make it better and now I know how to make it better thus im working on improving it so idk im not sad or shiz over it (also yeah the subreddit is a prime example of people taking harsh critism as an end of the world (there is also even more looser the rules dead ass one mf posted his concentration camp build with a dead ass gas chamber in there)

1. READ THE FUCKING RULES (racial slur)  (homophobic slur) YOU FUCKING (slur mocking handicapped people)
jokes aside no W.I.P in creations thank you very much
2. its just overall ugly and lazy looking even at my standards, wings look weird with bad custom control surfaces.
3. it just kinda has little clutterfuck bs in it tbh but I can be wrong because of only a single angle
4. It makes no sense for it to be "10th gen stealth fighter" when it has very little thought on the minor lore in it as 1. cockpit is just a knock off SR-71 2.  Intakes where are they? are they in the bottom or idk 3. just to add into it none of the shapes here makes sense for how they could reflect radar
5. im not gonna talk about "UhhHUH HoW IS iT GOnNa fIRe wiTHOuT GunS?+????+? bc like they can be annoying to do
now the positives
1. the idea sounds cool to try to think off a modern plane
2. it looks pretty good for a beginner build
thats about it
creations-chat 2023-01-13 20:28:16 bro forgot new players in his pov this prolly took him some time and effort
<@842474302585831474>  like yeah same here simply said its just that what I think is high effort is like a fucking piece of dog shit compared to everyone doing these insane 5 billion block 2 block wide jets just like for him thats high effo even tho for the rest of us its well a steaming smelly fat piece of dog shit

creations-chat 2023-02-15 12:10:35 wait what this build has motor lock??? I didnt come to think of it just entirely because of how the prespective we got showed a really basic un motorlocked build

+ you could just have a single motor lock tower on the middle and then just have 2 angle lock motors on the towers sides

creations-chat 2023-02-15 13:48:19 ok let me rephrase it then. atleast build something before you ask help you know build the general shape or build just the darn shape and then ask help when you have some base on what to ask help for like experiment a bit before you are looking for the 100 step all ready and easy to follow guide to make your builds
creations-chat 2023-02-15 13:55:34 my brother in christ do you want me to go back to doing what i was doing or wanna reel me back to the conversation

Also just add more thrust <:clueless:942802644043464734>

Just decrease thrust or add engines to push it if you bad

Holy hell just use hover drives
creations-chat 2023-02-18 20:52:06 1st you add wheels. then you add 1 hover drive strip at the back that rotates and 1 hover drive strip at the middle to give balanced push. Add wings and boom now you can Vtol and if it isnt going down just add more weight or something to push it down

Ok im gonna sleep if you cant figure out how to do a vtol then I recommend crying about it

I honestly refuse to believe that like 90% of the F-14's look almost exactly like that because its not even accurate at all
creations-chat 2023-02-22 12:49:40 how do I know

<@448677698773057547> the picture shows the average gj solo plane yk the cheese grater wings and all that
creations-chat 2023-02-22 12:54:44 bc custom control surface too hard !1!11!11!! so we must make cheesegrater wings + angle lock is every tut makers kryptonite
creations-chat 2023-02-22 12:57:47 well the new ones do have and i am not exactly all that much familiar with vulpens planes
also to add to it yeah your right it looks really similiar

2nd off "GUYS LOOK HAHA I AM SO FUNNY GAY BAD GAY BAD WHY ARENT YOU ALL LAUGHING!1!1!11!!111!!"
3rd off wdym toxic?
Inorder to respond: if in your opinion like this kind of edgy humor is funny then alright be it have fun but like please realise that not everybody has the same humor as you and when you say something offensive and someone says its not funny then like... idk? just stop, go tell your jokes somewhere else?
creations-chat 2023-02-23 14:08:53 another thing to clear up. the joke you said. was offensive yes. it was not very offensive correct and I am not saying that its the end of  the world. and to be honest other people have different ways to take something as offensive. and nobody here said its offensive but still. Its offensive and there are a lot of example of places where the jokes are supposed to be offensive or clean where those places lose their meaning or what it used to be was gone and like thats all fine and shit and doesnt relate to this pretty much at all I have no idea why I said this but I said this anyway so like idk <:Shrugje139:652564379577090074>

TL;DR everything is offensive if you put into the right group of humans and this isnt according to my own understanding and according to what the bot is saying not a place where the running joke is transphobia homophobia or any of that shit but idk I could be wrong

there are you now happy?

Ultimate TL;DR try to say the N-word and see what the bot thinks about it.
creations-chat 2023-02-23 14:11:24 which one I honestly cant tell but I for some reason think you talking of me not sure tho

if you were then you were i am just curious on who you are targetting that on there really is nothing else interesting with me asking that

creations-chat 2023-02-28 11:52:36 hmm maybe I could do a F-15 that could be fun
creations-chat 2023-02-28 14:12:50 in my own personally opinion the Su57 looks really nice. but like it really should have been obvious that its not a stealth fighter even though they claim it bro. like it has 2 intakes in the bottom a good amount of smooth cuts instead of sharp and "cutty-ish" example tail, nose, and hatches. so yeah if you have like atleast tooken a single second to know why stealth fighters like F-22 or F-35, B-2 or hell even the F-117 its not because they look nice its because they use these specific things while making it inorder to avoid reflecting radar ray's or whatever back to the radar and other stuff that I am not smart enough to explain
creations-chat 2023-02-28 14:18:31 yeah I know its not a stealth fighter. Infact id like to believe that a lot of people dont think its a stealth fighter but for some reason people think its a stealth fighter because it kinda. Maybe ig???? looks like one you know if you squint your eyes and look at its features and compare them to something like the F-22 you can kinda think its a stealth fighter ig so there have been a lot of clowns who also prolly think that Horton's Ho 229 is a stealth fighter bc it looks similiar to B-2 or shit

creations-chat 2023-03-01 16:24:17 rule (doesnt exist <:KEKW:670310537300672528> ) of the internet. if you do not know what you are talking about then shut the fuck up about it. while yes it is arguable that the F-14 is good but looking how it has been a very big propaganda device for the USA and 99% of the things told about it is just cnp cnp cnp. I really dont want to take anything that is said off of it seriously. also I am too lazy to research it more closely. but basically in military groups if an opinion is popular then.  its 80/20 chance that its all built up on bullshit.
creations-chat 2023-03-01 16:26:31 how I feel when my text is longer than 15 words
creations-chat 2023-03-01 16:49:26 saying that people who dont like F-14 are felon fan's is like saying if you hate muscle cars then you love cyber trucks like ??? huh ??????

mmm... arguable. its not a good plane but its not a horrible plane. just way over hyped. just how people were taking all these russian bs (just like me) and when they found out that they are not really that good then they go to the normal conclusion of so all the russian shit must be dogshit when its more of a just mid. not good. not bad just mid.
creations-chat 2023-03-01 16:53:14 this. the same thing with A-10 it was super good and big gun go BRRRRRRRRRRRRRT and all that shit but. oh turns out its not really that good. so it must mean its dogshit like no. there are not only 2 sides of a coin. its more of a scale
creations-chat 2023-03-01 16:55:58 you are correct but its a trope with the russian army to design good shit but cut corner and good shit is bad. example. modern russian army, T-34. and thats about it on the list of overhyped because of the blueprints and hard factors

wrong. they cut corners because russian elites need that black super yacht broom broom ship size of a mansion or some stupid shit. thats why russians are using some dogshit radios or explosive reactive whatever the fuck armor I dont know I am not a tank maniac and instead know pretty surface level shit, is replaced with rubber instead of explosives. not because they dont have the money. and not because they mass produce these. no they dont actually. thats like the biggest misunderstanding in russian and soviet army. its because putin had no way to check if the money actually goes where its supposed to
creations-chat 2023-03-01 17:02:39 hey thats cool. who would have guessed that the F-35 is stealthier than felon. now show me the comparison between felon and Mcdon

no you still cant post unfinished builds I am sorry to tell you this <@567763933952475157>

pretty sure you cant but thats still a insane build. sad it never got finished
creations-chat 2023-03-04 13:32:04 did you look at what he said about the build?

"Train I was making a few months ago but got deleted"
creations-chat 2023-03-04 13:35:09 yeah its extremely suspicious how he absolutely ignores when asked about other pictures off the ship
creations-chat 2023-03-04 13:37:36 pan crazy

creations-chat 2023-03-04 15:35:56 what is up with the amount of build stealers today
creations-chat 2023-03-04 18:38:33 ever heard of a thing called "its not good just because its not easy" it needs to actually look good

oh boy hopefully it was just because my computer was overheating and roblox servers are not actually dying. it would be very sad if that was the case
creations-chat 2023-03-04 18:42:22 bro literally the only part about that which would end up taking effort is balancing it
creations-chat 2023-03-04 18:44:24 yeah but it still is ugly.

also no its not I hope you are actually not serious with that last statement
creations-chat 2023-03-04 18:49:43 I know damn well. but like simply said its still ugly. and no its not even close to the only one that can pvp while standing
creations-chat 2023-03-04 18:52:26 yeah but its style is ugly.
creations-chat 2023-03-04 18:56:39 1. its really rigid and blocky.
2. it has a weird shape 
3. the colors do not fit at all. the top is too vibrant and makes it look stupid.
4. The rocket mounts are extremely ugly like they do not look good at all
5. the legs do look nice tho
6. the whole entire build just suffers from you not experimenting at all. leaving a lot of the detail look lazy and rushed

you just fixing the paint job is not gonna miraculously fix it. its still gonna suffer from the 4 other problems
creations-chat 2023-03-04 19:03:30 aight ill join there ig...

creations-chat 2023-03-04 19:29:51 I just have to say. this.
creations-chat 2023-03-04 19:49:38 1. read the damn rules
creations-chat 2023-03-04 19:53:58 then you would know to not post damn reference images in <#384025409945337856>  now wouldn't you?

yeah sounds like you didnt read the damn rules.

next time someone tells you to read the rules dont try to act like you smart or shit just like read the rules and try to look what someone is trying to point out to you bro
creations-chat 2023-03-04 19:58:50 when? I told you why people are not upvoting your mech. because its bad? because its not good??? idk. you asked me to show whats wrong. I showed whats wrong. and then I trash talked you when you were lagging a server where you should not have been. I reinforce rules inorder to spite you yes. but im just keeping it as a small. hey dont do this next time as you should not do it. and you start to act all high and mighty and shaming me for it like ok bruh
creations-chat 2023-03-04 20:02:06 breaks 2 rules.
gets told not to break rules
"WOwW YoU ARe aLl sO ToXic"
<@584060481522761728>  first line of the rules
creations-chat 2023-03-04 20:04:54 I DONT FUCKING KNOW???? IN COMMON SENSE?????? WHEN HAS TAKING CREDIT AND REWARDS FROM OTHER PEOPLES WORK BEEN LIKE A GOOD THING TO DO????????

like bitch think. use your fucking brains.
creations-chat 2023-03-04 20:07:17 I got mad because thats literally the level of. "who says I cant copy this random persons work and monetize it?? where is the rule for it??" like literally I told you to read the rules like atleast twice today and you read it exactly 0 times
creations-chat 2023-03-04 20:09:40 I DONT CARE WAAA WAAA WAAA. if someone tells you to break the rules do you do it because "he asked me to" like I asked you the same question earlier and you still cant like connect your brains into it. like literally if you do a crime because someone tells you to do it you are still getting punsihed. same thing here. I am literally going mad because you are so STUPID
creations-chat 2023-03-04 20:11:48 actually please shut the fuck up already. you are just digging your grave

I am not trying to ruin your day also i am just venting my anger that I have built up from seeing you spit dumbass shit

creations-chat 2023-03-04 20:18:31 well I didnt admit I was dumb and idc if I get my ass warned or banned I just like really hate you and I hate you entire because you are absolutely delusional like how are you going to say that you want people to like you and be with you when you are constantly saying some dumbass shit. example this chat log.

tbh we 2 are really similiar we both are assholes and really hateable. the only difference is that I understand it you dont
creations-chat 2023-03-04 20:22:46 oh yeah we are not similiar. you annoy every single person on the server accidentally because you never read the fucking rules and cant understand that you are not as great as you think you are.

I annoy a single person by being a asshole and a miserable person to talk to

<@798762760460173333>  frfr no cap on god
creations-chat 2023-03-04 20:25:35 oh so it was you you fucking shit bag. your build can be high effort for you but its still 1. ugly and 2. easily recreatable. and same to you read the fucking rules thank you very much now allow me to ignore the rules

<@463762925325123594>  in my opinion. you could be a piss stain from a random ass ring in jupiter or shit. I dont care where you are from. I care that you are not so blood boilingly stupid

I refuse to calm down.

ok cool but it still sucked ass at the time.

creations-chat 2023-03-05 09:16:44 I am assuming you are telling me to delete the build??
creations-chat 2023-03-05 09:19:33 1. that sadly came a bit too late so ill just like try to fix it without changing it a lot or something
