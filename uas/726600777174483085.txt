bug-reports 2020-11-15 09:22:35 [BUG REPORT] Sometimes when I join a Plane Crazy server, when I build, **the blocks do not appear before I place them**, which makes building difficult since I’m rotating the object blindly. _[DEVICE INFO: iPhone 7 Plus with iOS 14.1, Roblox Version 2.455.413788.]_
bug-reports 2020-11-15 09:57:37 Yes, very. Not only odd but really annoying.
