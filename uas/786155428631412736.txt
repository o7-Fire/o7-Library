creations-chat 2021-06-12 06:05:30 Yeah, nah. This is just racist. And stfu you have no power over me.
creations-chat 2021-06-12 06:08:08 Stfu dude we're talking about planes not goddamn boats
creations-chat 2021-06-12 06:11:25 ðŸ¥± this is getting boring. Summary? You all should stfu, mind your own damn business, and lastly. *Your opinion doesn't matter.* Nope
creations-chat 2021-06-12 06:15:29 U literally crashed. And for the record <@593888896719519744>, You literally have a game/meme pfp. He literally insulted mine first. I really don't think a lot of you don't have skills irl
creations-chat 2021-06-12 06:19:23 Excuse me? You all have been harrasing me since I've been chatting here. And also, I haven't been crying, I'm been silent here for the last hour.
creations-chat 2021-06-12 06:21:33 Couldn't care less.
creations-chat 2021-06-12 06:23:45 I *am* not bragging. I **am** merely saying, I **do not** care about your opinion, I merely am defending my creations.
creations-chat 2021-06-12 06:30:56 Dude, I know what an F-22 looks like
creations-chat 2021-06-12 06:33:34 Shredders suck.

the-dump 2021-06-12 08:37:36 *confusion*
creations-chat 2021-06-14 14:32:27 Yes, I know, And **thank** you for the feedback, People literally just harrass me for terrible builds
creations-chat 2021-06-14 14:34:29 True true, Question, any thing that needs fixing to make it looks like an F-22?
creations-chat 2021-06-14 14:36:50 Ikr, people regularly snap at so-called mid-level builds, Yes, I know an F-22 isn't mid-level (imagine having to edit messages just to reply<:KEKW:670310537300672528>)
creations-chat 2021-06-14 14:40:35 I guess I don't mind? btw I used a conveyor engine and the Jet usually has problems controlling. Any thoughts on how to keep it from turning randomly?
creations-chat 2021-06-14 14:44:24 Dude, I am *struggling* to even make a decent one. (lol part of my mind is trying to downvote the thing)
creations-chat 2021-06-14 14:46:26 I literally had to use the longest wedge just to make it long, Anyways, Thanks for all the tips (seriously) I appreciate it I'm probably gonna try to create it
creations-chat 2021-06-14 14:52:43 Quick Question Btw lol, How exactly do you make the Vertical Stabilizers Diagonal, My last build included motors to make it diagonal
creations-chat 2021-06-14 14:54:50 Cool cool, thanks
help 2021-06-17 14:58:49 Any suggestions on how to keep a conveyor-engine-powered Jet controlled?

creations-chat 2021-07-17 14:26:09 **pain**
bug-reports 2021-07-17 14:44:59 Ah yes, the Funny
creations-chat 2021-07-17 15:10:52 Maybe a few cylinders with a smoke pipe / Hover Thruster, Try making it look bulkier with some extra [albeit unecessary] blocks
creations-chat 2021-07-17 15:14:33 Definetely Add more blocks to the turret.
creations-chat 2021-07-20 10:36:29 RIP to all slow planes
