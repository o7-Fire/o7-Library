[Building]
Add a function that allows to “open” the building on your plot for your friends. So people could cooperate when they build something very big. Maybe there could be like special list, where the chosen players get permission to cooperate with you.
Also a function allowing to “Download” a certain build, basically copying it, but the person whose build is being downloaded must allow that in settings.

bug-reports 2022-03-09 08:20:27 There is a bug regarding cutters and pistons. If a cutter block is attached to piston, it just stops working.

[OTHER]
Make it possible to make certain creations possible to copy for other players so people could kind of share their builds. The sharing function could also make it possible/impossible to add more blocks, set mechanisms up differently or recolor. This would give us the possibility to give others our builds without needing to tell them how it works and what must be done to build such things.
