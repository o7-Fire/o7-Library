creations-chat 2018-12-06 22:20:13 how do you submit creations in <#384025409945337856>
creations-chat 2018-12-06 22:20:45 oh
creations-chat 2018-12-06 22:22:25 oh ok
creations-chat 2018-12-06 22:22:38 i just wanted to post my first working aircraft
creations-chat 2018-12-08 14:29:23 my plane superior
creations-chat 2018-12-08 14:30:34 literally my first working aircraft
creations-chat 2018-12-08 14:31:30 the problem is
creations-chat 2018-12-08 14:31:37 apparently physics arent the best
creations-chat 2018-12-08 14:31:44 because its virtually weightless inside
creations-chat 2018-12-08 14:31:49 it just fails to lift for some reason
creations-chat 2018-12-08 14:32:02 i was trying to do it realistically
creations-chat 2018-12-08 14:32:25 i mean now that I think about it it does have an interior
creations-chat 2018-12-08 14:32:39 a good amount of leather seats, countertops
creations-chat 2018-12-08 14:32:40 tvs
creations-chat 2018-12-08 14:32:43 a lavatory
creations-chat 2018-12-08 14:32:46 two bedrooms
creations-chat 2018-12-08 14:32:55 i already built the interior
creations-chat 2018-12-08 14:33:06 xd
creations-chat 2018-12-08 14:33:23 surprisingly only 644 parts
creations-chat 2018-12-08 14:34:06 i tried to replace those rockets at the front with jets but they didnt produce enough lift
creations-chat 2018-12-08 14:34:24 not to mention there's also a rocket in the back to add downward thrust so I can get off the ground
creations-chat 2018-12-08 14:34:29 super rockets
creations-chat 2018-12-08 14:35:04 I did do something to provide a lot of extra lift though
creations-chat 2018-12-08 14:35:25 underneath the cockpit the floor is made of wing panels with a half block slope leading into it so it just looks like an elevated floor at first glance
creations-chat 2018-12-08 14:35:42 when really it gives the plane extra lift
creations-chat 2018-12-08 14:36:41 xd
creations-chat 2018-12-08 14:37:11 also if you see anyone who posted a dornier 328 work in progress in creations
creations-chat 2018-12-08 14:37:17 im the original creator

creations-chat 2018-12-08 14:38:49 what if I just cover the side with more half blocks lmao
creations-chat 2018-12-08 14:39:09 I'm fine with people copying my dornier
creations-chat 2018-12-08 14:39:12 just expanding the fleet

creations-chat 2018-12-08 14:44:29 I got bored so i thought

creations-chat 2018-12-08 14:44:34 so i did
creations-chat 2018-12-08 14:44:58 It's so heavy it doesn't even float anymore

creations-chat 2018-12-08 14:45:32 I just started it yesterday
creations-chat 2018-12-08 14:45:37 but I already reached the max height
creations-chat 2018-12-08 14:45:56 I might make the taller parts fold onto it
creations-chat 2018-12-08 14:46:54 then I have to figure out how to cram a housing unit, helipad, 2 lifeboat launchers, ship dock, and a crane all onto this
creations-chat 2018-12-08 14:50:59 lmao

creations-chat 2018-12-10 21:44:25 first of all why do you have rockets on the outside of the craft and why are there even visible 90 degree angles too
