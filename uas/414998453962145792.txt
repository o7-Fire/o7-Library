plane-crazy 2020-07-29 17:13:09 Suggestion water tight blocks

so if your building a sub you add those water tight blocks or wedges so you dont have to swim around in the sub bumping into stuff that's annoying so theres the water tight blocks and wedges where theres no water inside the build so you dont got to deal with swimming and just walk inside a boat or ship or sub! And when it hits a sharp object like a rock or something the build will flood with water and sink without having to use motors and ballets tanks to sink your own build and it saves more time and less blocks so you can use the blocks! that's my suggestion the easy way for people that needs good boats and subs!
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 22:56:58 I got a Suggestion water tight blocks and water tight wedges where if your build like a ship boat or a submarine you can walk in it without having to struggle to swim in the below decks under water or in a submarine!
