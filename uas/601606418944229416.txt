help 2022-01-24 21:13:49 i would motor lock cylinders into place though you probably wouldnt be able to make a glass cockpit then because the motors used to angle the glass would be visible

creations-chat 2022-01-26 15:39:52 i dont really feel motivated to finish this hstv-l, anyone have any ideas
help 2022-01-26 16:25:46 how would i do the gun for the hstvl?
help 2022-01-26 16:26:54 alright
help 2022-01-26 17:40:09 its going to be quite a small gun as the vehicle itself is fairly small
help 2022-01-26 17:40:39 as of now the hull is far from completion and i still need to cram in a few details
help 2022-01-26 18:39:02 do you mean something like this
help 2022-01-26 18:39:23 with how the engines are integrated into the wing?
help 2022-01-26 18:40:12 so what plane are you currently working on
help 2022-01-26 18:40:25 wing shape depends on the plane
help 2022-01-26 18:40:37 i would look at some cold war fighters for inspiration
