The Tale of chidge (226063395021914113)
help 2019-05-24 18:41:02 I keep seeing youtube videos of tutorials and when they fly, they can use their cursor to fly, instead of using keys. How can I change this setting?
help 2019-05-24 18:56:50 How do I set that up?
help 2019-05-24 18:59:09 yes?
help 2019-05-24 20:13:53 <@!495186126055931904> I figured it out, everyone words it so weirdly. Basically when you place a control surface, don't edit any of the boxes (manual controls), leave it blank. It will automatically follow your mouse when flying.
help 2019-05-25 21:12:10 If you set your material as metal, does it become heavier? I had a perfectly working aircraft until I painted it all metal, and feels heavy and will not take off.
help 2019-05-25 21:20:28 My aircraft will not take off, no matter how many engines there are, it doesn't lift..

help 2019-05-25 21:20:40 Any suggestions?
help 2019-05-25 21:22:29 "heard of wings" <@!456238251204935690>
help 2019-05-25 21:22:59 So to make them thicker, don't use wing panels, use actual blocks?
help 2019-05-25 21:23:34 No, I genuinely did not know at that point.
help 2019-05-25 21:23:43 Don't how the physics in the game work.
help 2019-05-25 21:24:46 üëè I'll pas.
help 2019-05-25 21:24:49 But thank you.
help 2019-05-25 21:25:10 There's nowhere to make them to do another layer either
help 2019-05-25 21:25:30 Even bigger?
help 2019-05-25 21:25:53 I thought they were all ready oversided, I'll double the size of em then. üëç

help 2019-05-25 21:26:56 I'ma just spam a lot of rockets, to see if that is the problem
help 2019-05-25 21:27:32 I got to around 400 mph, no lift.
help 2019-05-25 21:27:48 So it's to do with wings.
help 2019-05-25 21:28:38 Oh I just realised what it was..
help 2019-05-25 21:29:07 Apparently this nuke weights 200 tonnes.
help 2019-05-25 21:29:09 When I dropped it, everything was overpowered.
