creations-chat 2021-07-01 09:32:32 looks good so far, does it fly well?
creations-chat 2021-07-01 09:40:50 I would try to make the wings solid, and fix some of the edges
creations-chat 2021-07-01 09:44:36 looks like it flys pretty good though

creations-chat 2021-07-01 09:46:38 I've definitely made worse
creations-chat 2021-07-01 09:49:08 I more make ships than planes so it would make sense :/

creations-chat 2021-07-01 18:45:36 it looks more like a cargo ship with a flat top imo

creations-chat 2021-07-01 19:32:47 what do you guys think?
creations-chat 2021-07-01 19:35:18 I'll have to look into that, any thoughts on how I can improve it?

creations-chat 2021-07-01 19:43:09 <@!714878625484243101> I have the cannons actually protrude from the ship, but do you mean something else?
creations-chat 2021-07-01 20:33:47 maybe half wedges
creations-chat 2021-07-01 20:51:04 oof
creations-chat 2021-07-01 20:53:10 thanks for being honest I suppose, I'm fairly new to motor locking so I left the train mostly bulky

creations-chat 2021-07-02 02:06:57 It was my first train build so I wasn't going for realism to be honest, but I still see what you mean

creations-chat 2021-07-03 19:33:40 <@!805650482940477451>  I like the slope of the jet, looks good
help 2021-07-25 10:09:22 hey so, on my ship I have four main guns and 3 of them aim correctly with motor 2s but my fourth wont aim up for some reason
help 2021-07-25 10:09:26 
help 2021-07-25 10:09:38 is there any reason for this?
help 2021-07-25 10:10:34 <@!504577008383033344> not in reverse
help 2021-07-25 10:10:47 and I'll try spawning it at the base and water a couple of times to see if it changes
help 2021-07-25 10:16:00 yeah they seem to be working now
help 2021-07-25 10:16:12 
help 2021-07-25 10:16:22 good tip on the reverse though if they start acting up consistently again
help 2021-07-25 10:16:30 didnt think of that for some reason
help 2021-07-25 10:16:40 thanks

bot-central 2021-07-27 03:44:46 yikes
creations-chat 2021-08-07 07:29:49 <@!758525515362992160> Despite it being a strip club I actually think the interior/lighting is pretty good, nice job
creations-chat 2021-08-08 03:44:02 <@!99607451300548608> Very cool concept and good execution, if you were to make another but a little smoother I think it could look extremely good
creations-chat 2021-08-08 03:53:25 <:Upvote:490311647492309004> :)
creations-chat 2021-08-31 21:44:22 <@!830883571119423539> That Metallica logo looks pretty sick man, good job
creations-chat 2021-09-10 23:50:28 <@!527653676022628353> you might be right, but the gun amount and sizes are comparable to a cruiser
creations-chat 2021-09-10 23:54:36 because the size of my ship, and the ship it was based off of aren't large enough imo
creations-chat 2021-09-10 23:58:40 I tried to recreate this
creations-chat 2021-09-11 00:01:21 <@!527653676022628353> I appreciate you calling me out on the details though, it's the little things that matter
creations-chat 2021-09-18 20:58:38 <@!431881268775616513> Nice river boat man, I always wanted to make one, well done
creations-chat 2021-10-24 20:53:41 my attempt at a flower corvette, what do you guys think?
creations-chat 2022-04-06 07:48:39 <@!683066163068010524> thanks, tried my best to make it accurate
creations-chat 2022-04-06 08:13:32 <@!720891502108344360> not willing to redo all the camera locking atm, but here some pics on the plot
creations-chat 2022-04-06 08:15:48 glad you liked her
creations-chat 2022-04-06 08:18:23 <@!721103577380159490> Thank you, hardest part was getting the shape right, and the color palette, I'm pretty happy with how it turned out though
creations-chat 2022-07-03 14:49:49 <@385421093969854465> The ship looks pretty good, and nice job on the rigging, I would just add more detail to the hull
