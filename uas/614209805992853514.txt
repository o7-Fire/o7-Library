The Tale of plane_crazy1010 (614209805992853514)
creations-chat 2022-06-03 02:28:54 I found a propulsion idea (i dont know if others discovered it) but its basically 4 hover drives with locked pistons around a block. it can be used for builds that need propellers that can propel aircraft. if anybody wants to use it feel free to.
creations-chat 2022-06-03 02:30:56 i can try to but its gonna be a long sentence
creations-chat 2022-06-03 02:34:06 So my idea consists of using a regular 1x1 block and 4 hover drives. the hover drives (with locket pistons instead of motors) spin the 1x1 block. this with a block with 4 propeller blades can create a propulsion device powering things like turboprops or other propeller aircraft.
creations-chat 2022-06-03 02:36:45 Im new to discord alright? i dont know how to share pictures on this.
creations-chat 2022-06-03 02:38:47 oh great, how do i get that in a good amount of time?

the-dump 2022-06-03 04:15:57 im back yayy
the-dump 2022-06-03 04:16:10 i know
the-dump 2022-06-03 04:16:23 it was on purpose cause i was trying to c o m u n i c a t e
the-dump 2022-06-03 04:16:39 now i must go back to creation chat
creations-chat 2022-06-03 04:16:54 IM BACK!!!
creations-chat 2022-06-03 04:19:49 so umm it was just for communication and i got muted for spamming to get lvl 3 chat level "bruh idk if that is a thing" for sending photos of build ideas. anyways about my hover engine idea its like the hover drive tutorial but the hover drive drives a shaft that rotates and spins a propeller. i modified it with locked pistons to make it handel rpm faster. i really want yall to make it but i cant show you how because of level thing so umm.. i wanted to make this as big as possible so i get all my info in one sweep. im super sorry about the long message Lol
creations-chat 2022-06-03 04:24:43 What is unde. also i am gonna explain as simple as i possibly can to show you how to make the engine. The starting point is a motor. add 2 blocks on the grey part of the motor verticaly. next grab 4 hover thrusters and add them on the block closest to the motor around it and make them look like it can spin. next add a locked piston to power all 4. next add propeller blades and there ya go. any questions, ask me and i will answer them when the 2 minute timer runs out.

the-dump 2022-06-03 05:30:18 oh.
the-dump 2022-06-03 05:34:42 im at lvl 3 now but i got a problem
the-dump 2022-06-03 05:36:04 i did "print screen" and took a screenshot of my idea but idk how to find that idea to send it on the creations-chat
the-dump 2022-06-03 05:36:36 mostly not knowing where to look in files
creations-chat 2022-06-03 05:43:07 hey creations chat i need your help here, i dont know where to look in files to find a screenshot that i taken to show a idea. if anybody knows how to help please let me know..
the-dump 2022-06-03 05:46:16 no, i need help browsing the files to get the screenshot i took
the-dump 2022-06-03 05:49:54 aha!
the-dump 2022-06-03 05:49:56 thx
creations-chat 2022-06-03 05:52:09 Alright, so i found it. This is a experimental engine me and my freind made and it can be used to power any propellor aircraft that can support it. the pistons have to be locked and the downside is RPM breaks (basicly the engine breaking apart when it reaches a rpm it cannot handel)
creations-chat 2022-06-03 05:56:17 No, Motors make it less efficient. Based on countless tests with different builds it is worse at handling rpm. the locked pistons help prevent a major amount of that from happening.
creations-chat 2022-06-03 06:03:13 did it get fixed?
creations-chat 2022-06-03 06:05:15 your test was too close to the ground and the ground made it spin not the motors
creations-chat 2022-06-03 06:13:53 the motor variant works well with cars and other stuff
creations-chat 2022-06-03 19:48:16 i posted a b-29 in <#384025409945337856> if anybody wants to see it. (feedback optional)

bug-reports 2022-06-06 19:21:11 it is despawned

the-dump 2022-06-13 01:10:42 im having trouble getting a project to work. is it alright if i post a incomplete plane on this?
the-dump 2022-06-13 01:11:47 reason why here is cause its a place that  memes and other forms can go to.
the-dump 2022-06-13 01:17:46 Possibly trashed project: 1965 PIPER PA-28-140. does this require a remake or should I just keep building it.
the-dump 2022-06-13 01:18:40 alr thx
the-dump 2022-06-13 23:27:44 how to turn off rocket exhaust?
the-dump 2022-06-13 23:28:34 damn, I look ugly.
the-dump 2022-06-13 23:29:41 mmm
the-dump 2022-06-13 23:30:06 i think thats called turning off infinite fuel
the-dump 2022-06-13 23:30:30 yea probably
the-dump 2022-06-13 23:31:39 What's a unde, I keep seeing the same word almost every day and I don't know what it means.

the-dump 2022-06-13 23:56:36 at 2:53 on the scam destroying video i just got that message today on my own server. glad i reported it as spam..
the-dump 2022-06-14 00:04:36 science is awesome.. am i right?
the-dump 2022-06-14 00:06:37 no they are reselling for a reason that i forgot about.
the-dump 2022-06-14 00:14:07 I can see the frustration from here..
the-dump 2022-06-14 00:16:29 I still cant stop looking at this video, its just a very good explanation of the main purpose of a kinder surprise egg.
the-dump 2022-06-14 00:18:04 oh.
the-dump 2022-06-14 00:18:15 ive noticed something
the-dump 2022-06-14 00:19:03 he ate the surprise part instead of the chocolate.
the-dump 2022-06-14 00:27:10 wait is it acualy?
the-dump 2022-06-14 00:28:00 its from Texas.
the-dump 2022-06-14 00:34:00 
the-dump 2022-06-14 00:35:08 Then what to do with this..
the-dump 2022-06-14 00:35:42 I dont really do good with memes..

the-dump 2022-06-14 01:07:52 What is a meme?
the-dump 2022-06-14 01:11:05 btw I'm just posting random stuff I find interesting. nothing special about it.
the-dump 2022-06-14 01:12:37 well I dont know how servers work. so if i get banned or warned i will just be sad for a while
the-dump 2022-06-14 01:13:12 mistakes are always there and they will not stop comming
the-dump 2022-06-14 01:14:17 wanna know where i found the link of that video?
the-dump 2022-06-14 01:14:50 Aeronautica Community
the-dump 2022-06-14 01:14:57 nope
the-dump 2022-06-14 01:16:29 Im glad i made that 1965 PIPER PA-28-140 or in the austrailian sales market the Piper Cherokee 140
the-dump 2022-06-14 01:16:49 i can send a link to the plane if you want
the-dump 2022-06-14 01:25:12 How do I say things in this very server that doesn't make me a total idiot? anyways I'm always in this room just either watching tv or playing on this very pc. I have ideas that I wanna make on plane crazy but only under 25% of those ideas actually get made. but how do I even use this server? do I just sit here and do nothing watching the memes pour through and ask questions or do I just send memes that doesn't really make sense to me? I just don't know how to use a server and I am still learning. if this bothers anybody due to the size of this I am sorry but I'm just not very smart in socializing in a 30,000+ server. i wonder what i will get from the mods from that video i sent from the Aeronautica Community server.

the-dump 2023-02-01 22:31:22 Hello Gordon. I'm remaining to be quiet as there is nothing i can do currently. I feel like this message is gonna make people be real mad for no darn reason I don't care. We all have to start somewhere. either if we are noob or plane uneducated about plane crazy. if there is a person showing off their builds at least give them some thing that keeps them going so they can actually be "welcome" in the game. yall saying mean things about other people or their builds would drive players off, therefore making them think the game is filled with bullies. I don't care if you cuss at me or say mean things. all I am here for is to have fun and actually have something to do for once. Goodnight and enjoy a restful sleep.
the-dump 2023-02-01 22:34:51 i do eat pizza like sometimes but not all the time. im not fat either. its not like just because i sit on a chair means that im instantly fat. also, i cannot move pizza with my mind or anything else. thats just supernatural isnt that right?
