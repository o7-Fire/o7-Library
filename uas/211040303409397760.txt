creations-chat 2018-11-05 13:14:38 -and for sound I used propeller engines
creations-chat 2018-11-05 13:14:42 so it made a sound
creations-chat 2018-11-05 13:14:45 instead of silent wheels XD
creations-chat 2018-11-05 13:15:11 I need to add paint n such
creations-chat 2018-11-05 13:15:14 but its getting there
creations-chat 2018-11-05 13:15:18 over 500 blocks XD

creations-chat 2018-11-05 13:16:50 I even managed to get a door to work
creations-chat 2018-11-05 13:16:57 first version for the door failed
creations-chat 2018-11-05 13:17:00 it clipps the side
creations-chat 2018-11-05 13:17:03 so I used half blocks
creations-chat 2018-11-05 13:17:05 and fixed it
creations-chat 2018-11-05 13:17:10 the turret turns
creations-chat 2018-11-05 13:17:17 and the little piece to allow the camera to appear
creations-chat 2018-11-05 13:17:19 lifts up
creations-chat 2018-11-05 13:17:29 even the front drops down and the rear folds
creations-chat 2018-11-05 13:17:35 all I need is its side plates

creations-chat 2018-11-05 13:18:09 -unlike other games-
creations-chat 2018-11-05 13:18:45 for the rear wheels I put a half block so any dust can blow out
creations-chat 2018-11-05 13:18:49 so it dosent catch inside
creations-chat 2018-11-05 13:18:50 XD
