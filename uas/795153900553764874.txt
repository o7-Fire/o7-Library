bot-central 2021-06-13 03:44:01 I have literally no rank

creations-chat 2021-06-13 07:17:02 On which dimension?
creations-chat 2021-10-01 02:37:30 Advice?
creations-chat 2021-10-01 02:42:57 In what way do I add detail to a sub exterior
creations-chat 2021-10-01 02:48:31 Isn't that what a sub is? A tube with fins and rudder and block sticking out. I think I should add forward fins though
creations-chat 2021-10-01 02:53:14 I already used a lot of wedges in the form of half down wedges on the flat parts. It's just hard to see it in the photo. I also find rounding stuff in really hard on such a small scale like the tower

creations-chat 2021-10-25 05:12:13 <@685120060292989001> I would recommend changing the hull a bit to make it more smoother

help 2021-12-03 02:45:57 Unless you want to over complicate it

help 2021-12-03 03:16:33 Ah yes "movement"
