bot-central 2020-07-20 21:04:30 How do I suggest stuff?
bot-central 2020-07-20 21:04:37 ?shelp
bot-central 2020-07-20 21:10:26 &suggest Copy paste functions
[Building]
So basically copy paste functions (copy, paste and mirror) only for players with about 72 hours of gameplay or less/more (which can be seen in settings) to prevent spam, lag machines and actually be used professionally. It would help a lot with building in this game and would improve everyone's experience.

bug-reports 2020-09-09 22:39:27 A new bug: Basically, when you join a non/pvp game, there's a big chance you won't be able to enter ANY plot at ALL without even being blacklisted, it's very annoying for pvp having to rejoin like 3 times to fix it. Since the update  the blacklist broke, <@217336009455566848> and now the barrier has a chance to be activated in every plot since the beginning (not visual) . Do you know anything about this bug?
bug-reports 2020-09-09 22:40:04 It's been annoying me for days
bug-reports 2020-09-09 22:43:09 Smh that moment when Rickje goes offline to ignore you

bug-reports 2020-09-10 12:25:42 also <@!217336009455566848> this thing has one more bug, I'll try to record it
bug-reports 2020-09-10 12:26:48 
bug-reports 2020-09-10 12:26:57 I have no idea what led to this, rick but it might break the game in the future
bug-reports 2020-09-10 12:27:08 just be careful about it.
bug-reports 2020-09-10 12:27:31 this vehicle has 3 god damn bugs in itself

bug-reports 2020-09-10 12:28:56 <@!217336009455566848> When I'm in the mood, I'll record and probably post some of the bugs.

bug-reports 2020-09-12 20:37:51 There's a new bug, <@!217336009455566848> . The parachute messes up and turns the player into a torso and a head sometimes. from how many times it happened per how many parachutes I did, I can assume it's around ~1% chance for this to happen. I'll be offline so I won't be able to join any private server for this.
bug-reports 2020-09-12 20:38:38 very weird bug

creations-chat 2021-06-14 16:40:25 okay put wings on it, make it a rocketship, make it work on water, retractable wings and tail, retractable landing gear, add a vibrating ram on its front, add a huge ass spoiler, add conveyor engine, add tnt inside of it to lag servers <:trollface:775024642104229898> , turn it into a aircraft carrier, add retractable pvp weapons with full arsenal add a huge magnet shotgun on it.

creations-chat 2021-09-22 20:06:24 sorry for not making it a 1 block wide pancake
creations-chat 2021-09-22 20:08:57 what he just said is a personal opinion, not feedback. I asked if he had a problem with a specific part but he said the whole front
what would I do? remake the entire plane
creations-chat 2021-09-22 20:11:13 i get what you mean but that's not something I'm willing to "fix"

I wanted to see what you would tell me about, in case it was something minor but personally I like how the front looks so im not changing it
creations-chat 2021-09-22 20:15:07 Let me rephrase:
I asked for feedback so I could see what he didn't like, although I personally had no problem with how the front looked so I have no reason to change it
creations-chat 2021-09-22 20:18:32 To see what you didn't like? I would have changed it if it was something that wouldn't affect the weight, look and design too heavily, though changing the whole front is probably gonna mess up how it works.
If you mentioned anything about landing gear, tail, angles, or stuff like this, I would have taken a look at that part and probably changed it
but since it was the front,which I like as is, I have no reason to change it.
Because I ASK for feedback does not mean I am going to implement it.
creations-chat 2021-09-22 20:20:50 that would sound personal

creations-chat 2022-03-20 22:00:36 will motorlock engines to be 0.5 blocks away from the main frame, will try to shorten the canopy, front of the wings is angled, just not visible from the angle i took the ss at, still have not decided gun design, am gonna try to fix the other problems, ty for feedback
creations-chat 2022-03-20 22:02:50 -there will be blood shed
creations-chat 2022-03-20 22:07:06 Back in 2020, outlines were a thing, motorlock didnt exist, custom angles couldn't even be predicted, our builds sucked (a lot) because of our block restrictions.
now we have all these tools available, and I'm not gonna lie, we overreact and downvote perfectly fine builds into oblivion, but we gotta evolve a little in our building skills.
but yea we go freaking oonga boonga on everything posted in creations

will work on that in the future
creations-chat 2022-03-21 09:38:23 it kinda will due to the wing's custom angle, the angled part of the wing slightly penetrates the straight one

creations-chat 2022-06-09 18:34:34 better but not great. remove 1 block from its height and make it so that there's no 1x1 wing above the 1x4 on the back. Just remove 1 block off the top and the left side and make sure the 1x4 has nothing above it for a sharper look. Also try making it to scale with your own build, not take literally everything out of mine as my harrier is bigger in size
