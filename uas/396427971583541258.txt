creations-chat 2021-10-07 02:35:48 nah i think its pretty accurate so far, itll look a bit longer when the rudder and wings. the afterburners i have on my plane rn are just temporary btw
creations-chat 2021-10-07 02:38:03 oh yeah i just realized the intakes are quite long, gonna fix change the intake from a 1x3 wedge to a 1x2, should help it a bit

<@!723940197456281640> alright im gonna do that rq
creations-chat 2021-10-07 02:40:19 im gonna fix the nose

also lol

how do u guys think i should improve the nose, add a bit of angle lock to it maybe?

i see
creations-chat 2021-10-07 02:42:47 alright guys thx for the feedback, im gonna work on it later tho its a lot of work <:OkayChamp:709084018485887096>

the f14 is such a cool plane
creations-chat 2021-10-07 02:45:06 yeah i was actually thinking the canopy was a bit weird, since the back seat wasnt really fitting into the plane that well
creations-chat 2021-10-07 02:47:15 all I can say so far is to change the lights to something other than books, can you show us a different angle?

okay definitely lock the guns into the car instead of having them on the front
creations-chat 2021-10-07 02:51:22 ooohh, okay that makes a bit more sense, maybe make them pop out a bit less

actually pretty smart how u used the tips of the guns as headlights, i might use that for something
