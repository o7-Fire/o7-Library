bug-reports 2020-03-12 04:53:43 Hover thrusters and motors don't work well together trying to make a spinner with hover and motors to just barely turn them to face the ground control of speed and it randomly turns the motors without input hover are all set to 0 drag motor is set to powered
bug-reports 2020-04-08 22:53:05 The blue lines for plane info doesn't show up at random it some times does but a lot of the times it doesn't why is this?
bug-reports 2020-04-18 01:18:36 So the automatic controls on the control panels is what causes the camera to be annoying? So what if I'm not using any flying blocks at all? What's the cause for the camera to still be annoying?
Edit: so wheels count as a flying block to make the camera annoying I just checked all  control changing blocks and the wheels were the only one to have the set auto controls
bug-reports 2020-04-18 01:24:07 A new um big the wheels just flat up are broken without the auto control they have fully locked themself in the turning form
bug-reports 2020-04-18 01:24:48 The arrows are facing forward
bug-reports 2020-04-18 01:25:29 I placed the wheels the same way I have on all my other builds this is the first time it's broke and the first time I turned the auto setting off
bug-reports 2021-03-11 23:51:58 I dont know what i did but i somehow managed to perma glitch the main pilot seat so that it never stays where its normally placed. Ignoring blocks as well so it can glitch into other blocks and the game thinks its fine somehow
