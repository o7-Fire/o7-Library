plane-crazy 2020-05-09 23:40:52 I noticed it rotates without moving so I wanted to make a "blackhole" aka a sphere that just spins fast
plane-crazy 2020-05-09 23:40:12 I'm still confused
plane-crazy 2020-05-09 23:36:32 That doesn't make sense
plane-crazy 2020-05-09 23:35:44 How does the physics option work for a anchor block?
plane-crazy 2020-05-09 23:12:41 Big build energy
plane-crazy 2020-05-09 23:11:20 Legit it made me get out of the seat and yeet me to the other side of the map perfectly
plane-crazy 2020-05-09 23:11:01 Um my glitchy build yeeted me out of the seat
plane-crazy 2020-05-09 23:08:44 Hmm I think Harvard would like a word with you XD
plane-crazy 2020-05-09 23:07:46 A form of thrust with rope?
plane-crazy 2020-05-09 23:07:26 No force being applied at all and they just expanded
plane-crazy 2020-05-09 23:07:02 Um I dont know how but I broke suspensions with no force
plane-crazy 2020-05-09 23:05:30 The fastest I've hit when using just a really glitchy build is 3e38
plane-crazy 2020-05-09 23:05:07 How would you hit inf
plane-crazy 2020-05-09 23:04:49 That's 14 zeros
plane-crazy 2020-05-09 23:01:35 And it helps when you are yeeted at a few quintillion speed
plane-crazy 2020-05-09 23:01:18 There technically is it's just really far
plane-crazy 2020-05-09 23:00:55 I have a build that yeets you out of the world border XD
plane-crazy 2020-05-09 23:00:34 And how fast is your hyper sonic?
plane-crazy 2020-05-09 22:59:49 Bruh I flew into the giant death blades on the island I survived with my seat I jumped and it made me go into it
plane-crazy 2020-05-09 22:54:46 Aka lazy mode
plane-crazy 2020-05-09 22:54:41 3 degrees if I turn them on
plane-crazy 2020-05-09 22:54:30 The motors are to give it a little angle
plane-crazy 2020-05-09 22:52:26 The blocks are ballast at lowest density
plane-crazy 2020-05-09 22:52:13 It's mass it's insanely low
plane-crazy 2020-05-09 22:51:37 But I have build a super tiny plane with basically the same build and it flys in anyway I want it to even straight up this one on the other hand refuses to turn it can go up down straight up upside-down even
plane-crazy 2020-05-09 22:48:47 Here ya go
plane-crazy 2020-05-09 22:48:42 Discord on PC is extremely laggy so not happing if you want a mobile pic though
plane-crazy 2020-05-09 22:48:02 You want a phone picture?
plane-crazy 2020-05-09 22:47:35 It's the most stabile line glider I have ever seen to you could be angled 45 degrees and it still goes straight
plane-crazy 2020-05-09 22:46:59 I have built a plane that either has reversed flying controls aka you go left and it goes right or it just can't turn
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 10:40:14 The only thing I seem to be good at making are very fast spinning blades that wack people to a new dimension
plane-crazy 2019-05-24 16:28:07 That was a fast and random answer
plane-crazy 2019-05-24 16:27:44 Ok so anyone have a good answer as to why motors all facing the same way with the same keybinds can spin in a random direction when powered?
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 01:25:07 h
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 01:25:02 because i could?
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 01:24:42 could you just join me and look at it?
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 01:24:25 and right now the bottom ones are set to speed 1 where as the rest are speed 20
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 01:24:00 they are all facing the same way though
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 01:22:56 well its blocks spinning connected to more motors making heigher ones spin faster
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 01:21:48 i have everything set to defualt keybinds for the motors
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 01:21:23 like could explain if you looked at a build why one doesnt spin?
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 01:21:11 do you know them very well?
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 01:20:48 ?
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 01:20:45 do you know motors in plane crazy
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 01:19:56 idk you said it
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 01:18:55 could anyone know like really knows motors help me with a motor not spinning problom
