creations-chat 2018-12-16 21:00:45 The lorry is based off of the Volvo FH and has 3 trailers: a low loader, vehicle transporter and a DHL box trailer. All trailers are attached to the truck with magnets. Requesting expert builder and expert engineer

creations-chat 2018-12-16 21:00:47 
creations-chat 2018-12-16 21:00:47 
creations-chat 2018-12-16 21:04:38 It's a magnet that's connected to a non-powered motor
creations-chat 2018-12-16 21:05:06 Sometimes it can be a pain to hitch the trailer because there is only one specific spot where it welds
creations-chat 2018-12-16 21:05:24 Yeah I tried doing that and it was somewhat glitchy
creations-chat 2018-12-16 21:06:10 I see
creations-chat 2018-12-16 21:06:42 It worked on the Low loader because it's light but the DHL box one is super heavy and it breaks the pistons
creations-chat 2018-12-16 21:06:53 So I just switched all to magnets
creations-chat 2018-12-16 21:07:50 Well I like using the magnets because once they weld it's not coming off
creations-chat 2018-12-16 21:08:07 Even though sometimes it won't come off even after deactivating the magnets lol
creations-chat 2018-12-16 21:08:24 They work but unreliable af
creations-chat 2018-12-16 21:09:06 no
creations-chat 2018-12-16 21:09:22 I'm still making changes to the truck as I go
creations-chat 2018-12-16 21:09:47 The lights are supposed to be at the far edges of the truck but it looks ugly because of the light shape
creations-chat 2018-12-16 21:10:52 Oh they don't
creations-chat 2018-12-16 21:11:03 I have a little skidplate thingy

help 2019-01-16 19:29:07 Magnets are quite laggy and unreliable
help 2019-01-16 19:29:16 What are you using them for?

help 2019-01-16 19:31:10 Does it kinda 'teleport' before welding?
help 2019-01-16 19:35:42 Yeah it happens to weld unaligned a lot
help 2019-01-16 19:36:11 You need to fully unfold it, activate the magnet and then 'feather' the folding
help 2019-01-16 19:36:15 If that makes any sense
help 2019-01-16 19:36:32 yeah
help 2019-01-16 19:39:43 Basically all folding creations use magnets to lock the fold
help 2019-01-16 19:39:54 And I don't think toggle is really good for this

help 2019-01-16 19:42:44 it's mostly aimed at starters though
creations-chat 2019-01-17 07:32:24 It should, I think
creations-chat 2019-01-17 10:14:15 easiest way to get light speed is to: 
1) load a folding creation
2) go to your motors' torque and set that bitch to a 1000
3) spawn and don't let go of the unfold button
4) ????
5) profit
creations-chat 2019-01-17 10:17:57 yeah but helium is if you really want the rank
creations-chat 2019-01-17 10:18:12 and you can't get lightspeed with it

creations-chat 2019-02-13 23:51:30 M60 AVLB (Armored Vehicle Launched Bridge)
Based off of the M60 Patton, this tank has a portable folding bridge mounted on top of it.
The bridge is used to bring other tanks/vehicles across very rough terrain or deep holes.

-The tank has a top speed of 100 SPS with the bridge on top of it and about 150 without it.
-Deploying the bridge is very easy and takes around 30 seconds (motors were slowed down on purpose)
-After getting to the other end of the bridge, the tank is able to pick the bridge up and continue on it's way.
 
No suspension as of now, I'm going to add it soon though.

creations-chat 2019-04-19 21:25:13 if you needed 100+ parts for the rank, a land vehicle would need 200+
creations-chat 2019-04-19 21:26:35 you can still get ranks for land vehicles, such as designer, if i remember correctly

help 2019-04-26 20:03:02 so there's not enough friction between the cylinders to the pillar
help 2019-04-26 20:03:30 you can either put some pressure on it using springs, but that'd make it pretty unreliable and glitchy at times
help 2019-04-26 20:03:46 or use helium to make it lighter

creations-chat 2019-05-11 14:28:56 true, but 'unique' isn't really a word i'd use to describe it
creations-chat 2019-05-11 14:29:06 you're essentially using ropes to lift something
creations-chat 2019-05-11 14:29:32 what

creations-chat 2019-05-11 14:32:49 that is unique, and is not just using ropes to lift something
creations-chat 2019-05-11 14:33:36 if you think that you can get inventor for that door, i can ask for inventor if i made a trampoline with some springs
creations-chat 2019-05-11 14:33:43 yeah ok i'd like to see you make one
creations-chat 2019-05-11 14:38:18 some variations of doors can get you inventor
creations-chat 2019-05-11 14:38:23 but not JUST a single motor
creations-chat 2019-05-11 14:38:37 uhhhh
creations-chat 2019-05-11 14:39:06 although that looked nice, i'm not the one who decides whether you get inventor or not

creations-chat 2019-07-10 21:33:22 i couldn't care less about bad builds
creations-chat 2019-07-10 21:33:25 what i do care about
creations-chat 2019-07-10 21:33:38 is the fact that they think that it's worthy of submitting it to <#384025409945337856>
creations-chat 2019-07-10 21:33:47 looking at their build going "yeah that's good"
creations-chat 2019-07-10 21:33:52 and it's total shit
creations-chat 2019-07-10 21:34:43 the funniest thing is when people are surprised that they're getting downvoted
creations-chat 2019-07-10 21:34:59 thinking that their plane is apparently the gold standard for PC
creations-chat 2019-07-10 21:36:31 i don't really care about people asking for ranks even though they don't qualify for it

creations-chat 2019-07-10 21:37:31 i've seen (and built) good looking interiors before
creations-chat 2019-07-10 21:37:37 though some people just can't do it
creations-chat 2019-07-10 21:37:49 yeah that too
creations-chat 2019-07-10 21:38:10 that's one of the downsides of having the majority of your server around 13 years of age
creations-chat 2019-07-10 21:38:18 people's sense of humor is just crap
creations-chat 2019-07-10 21:44:02 interiors are great because you can add lots of detail
creations-chat 2019-07-10 21:44:21 and usually it's a massive boost to upvotes
creations-chat 2019-07-10 22:24:34 we aren't supposed to OFFER criticism, you're supposed to ask for it
creations-chat 2019-07-10 22:24:45 this channel is for showing off, not helping you build

creations-chat 2019-07-10 22:26:25 if i see someone that actually tried, i might give criticism
creations-chat 2019-07-10 22:27:04 many creations here were made by peopel who started playing days ago
creations-chat 2019-07-10 22:27:18 they barely know anything about it and have little to no experience
creations-chat 2019-07-10 22:28:11 when they try posting their not-so-good creations in the chat meant for pure flexing of course no one will care and just leave a downvote
creations-chat 2019-07-10 22:30:15 the only creations i bother to upvote are ones that actually impressed me
creations-chat 2019-07-10 22:31:55 just realized that what i said made no sense ok
creations-chat 2019-07-11 08:40:15 posting a block in creations for the 1.644563e+16th time is not funny

creations-chat 2019-07-12 19:55:25 same thing
creations-chat 2019-07-12 19:55:38 you're asking for modeler with a mechanical focused creation
creations-chat 2019-07-12 19:55:56 for modeler you need a unique design
creations-chat 2019-07-12 19:56:05 that stabilizer has no design whatsoever
creations-chat 2019-07-12 19:56:23 yes
creations-chat 2019-07-12 19:56:37 but giant tanks have already been made before
creations-chat 2019-07-12 19:56:44 so it's not unique
creations-chat 2019-07-12 19:57:14 "anyways though is that too bad for modeler at least?"

creations-chat 2020-02-26 20:35:51 >  idk... seems like everyone downvotes everything...
when will people come to terms with the fact that some builds look bad and therefore will get downvoted
creations-chat 2020-02-26 20:36:11 nobody downvotes builds for no reason
creations-chat 2020-02-26 21:17:14 you can find the answer right in your question
creations-chat 2020-02-26 21:17:17 > pixel art
creations-chat 2020-02-26 21:17:42 and it's not subjectively cool, people who downvoted didn't think it was cool
creations-chat 2020-02-26 21:17:56 most pixelarts are just copies from the internet which take little to no effort
creations-chat 2020-02-26 21:18:02 and they're boring
creations-chat 2020-02-26 21:18:16 so what
creations-chat 2020-02-26 21:19:30 your definition of cool is not what other's is
creations-chat 2020-02-26 21:19:57 the 3 other people who downvote it probably thought that pixelarts are lazy and unimaginative
creations-chat 2020-02-26 21:20:03 because they are
creations-chat 2020-02-27 16:52:38 because the bot posts every image file that's sent here

the-dump 2020-02-27 20:32:54 what's the threshold for it then

creations-chat 2020-03-13 20:27:29 you can think that it's jealousy but if you scroll up you can see very good builds with little to no downvotes

creations-chat 2020-03-14 16:49:44 it's nice to give your builds some lore but bruh who's going to read all that
creations-chat 2020-03-14 19:30:29 if you got lots of downvotes you can take it as a sign that you need to improve
creations-chat 2020-03-14 19:30:43 downvoting everyone else's builds for no reason won't help you build better
creations-chat 2020-03-14 19:31:04 and saying that everyone else is toxic as well is a pretty bad excuse as to why you're doing it
