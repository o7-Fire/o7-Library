bot-central 2020-07-20 19:54:14 &suggest [TITLE] - Technical Concepts
[CATEGORY] -  [Server]

[DESCRIPTION] - We should add a channel to the discord that is about technical concepts or tricks for building. For example, folding, fine meshing, and conveyer engine tutorials or descriptions could be put in the channel. I think this would help newer players learn more advanced techniques of building faster and therefore would output cooler and cooler builds.

help 2020-07-20 21:16:50 When it says "[3] All blocks must be attached to the creation.", does this mean folding isnt allowed?
help 2020-07-25 18:38:35 does your character weigh anything when your in the airplane?
help 2020-07-25 18:39:19 You sure?
help 2020-07-25 18:40:14 okay, thank you
help 2020-07-26 19:56:14 Does the green parts of the camoflauge look okay or do you have tips to paint better camo
help 2020-07-26 19:57:39 Yeah I thought of that too but the leading edge of the wing has a 1x4 delta wing so it either would extend a little bit or not go all the way to the edge
help 2020-07-27 16:30:31 After I drop bombs, the CoM gets thrown far forward, is there a way I can counterbalance this? I was thinking ballast tanks in the back but idk if that works in the air
help 2020-07-27 18:44:22 Whats a good way to protect against rockets?
help 2020-07-27 18:46:55 oh okay, thx
help 2020-07-28 19:19:30 Set their distance to max
help 2020-07-28 19:20:53 You might be able to pull it with ropes and lock it with magnets but id much rather have pistons sticking out under my carrier
help 2020-07-28 19:32:32 Shep, try magnets. Ive never used them but idk lol. Ballast blocks add weight to your craft, very useful to balance planes
help 2020-07-28 19:34:02 I couldn't tell ya. Id look up some videos about how they work and see if they're an option that could work
help 2020-07-28 19:34:49 Otherwise, maybe adding weight to it would help lock them in place or just holding down the fold button. Isn't there a toggle button on the motors/
creations-chat 2020-08-02 03:17:39 Click "plane crazy"
creations-chat 2020-08-20 17:10:15 maybe put canards at the front?

help 2020-09-03 13:43:42 how would I go about having an image on my phone and making a pixel art of it?

help 2020-09-06 19:58:51 stupid question, do water propellers give thrust even in air
help 2020-09-06 19:59:22 oh okay
help 2020-09-07 14:17:04 Which angle of attack on the blade has the most thrust? These are propeller blades
help 2020-09-07 14:28:18 ^I tested it and apparently I need to change some engines lol. The blades on the right producted more thrust.
