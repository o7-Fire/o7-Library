creations-chat 2021-04-09 15:54:17 I’m new at this
creations-chat 2021-04-09 15:57:02 I think you don’t know that, but I would like if you were to use a word other than trash as I can easily see that as being rude. 
I know my vehicle looks like rubbish but doesn’t exactly mean I can become an instant expert overnight.
Now, are you willing to change your words?
creations-chat 2021-04-09 15:59:45 The stabilizer is painted red because I based it off an actual B-17G’s paint. I do think the the main coat of paint should of been darker but yeah that’s it. 

Also I do think that was rather rude. If I were to say that about your builds, you’d be in a hissy fit.
creations-chat 2021-04-09 16:01:49 A hissy fit is like when your toxic energy just comes out of your body. 


Just remember, I am still new at this. I’m not perfect, but neither are you. It doesn’t justify your words tho.
creations-chat 2021-04-09 16:04:12 All I’m saying is if you are gonna give me feedback. It’s best to say “Needs some work” or “Ehhh.”

Anyways I wanna see your builds now <:WhatChamp:775044367022555166>
creations-chat 2021-04-09 16:06:14 Will do. <:trollface:775024642104229898> 

Also I’d like some feedback on my PT Boat. Tell me where I need to improve.
creations-chat 2021-04-09 16:08:15 It has a life boat on it.
creations-chat 2021-04-09 16:10:17 1. What’s a pcc builder?

2. I was building from memory <:trollface:775024642104229898>
creations-chat 2021-04-09 16:12:37 1. I wasn’t offended. I was actually focusing on the feedback.
2. Will do now.
3. Give me a definite answer for what a pcc is.
