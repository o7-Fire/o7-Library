bug-reports 2022-06-03 09:25:53 My rockets on my airplanes havent been working for a very long time now. I do not think this is on my end because I have a stable wifi connection and I run at 60 fps. The rockets do however work when I am standing still. They only dont work when I am moving in my planes.
