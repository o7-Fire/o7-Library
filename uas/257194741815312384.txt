creations-chat 2019-12-03 21:30:32 if it didnt have that mouth as a skin would be better
creations-chat 2019-12-03 21:30:59 ok
creations-chat 2019-12-04 14:24:08 <@!210141202698338304>  the reason i designed the torpedo like that was because the top would flip over without those wings at the back and change direction
creations-chat 2019-12-04 14:24:16 and i had to stabilise it
creations-chat 2019-12-04 14:25:41 and the cutter that i use as a warhead is to atleast penetrate one piece of armor (if possible) and then detonate the torpedo inside the ship causing more damage
creations-chat 2019-12-04 14:26:04 i can improve the design soon
creations-chat 2019-12-04 14:26:14 just to make it look more torpedo-like

creations-chat 2020-08-02 12:15:48 is this high enough for a kv-2 turret lol
creations-chat 2020-08-02 12:16:33 ok lets see what happens
creations-chat 2020-08-02 12:17:29 this is when i raise it by 2 blocks
creations-chat 2020-08-02 12:17:37 it think 1 block lower would be perfect
creations-chat 2020-08-02 12:23:50 lol
creations-chat 2020-08-02 12:26:33 well it is blocky
creations-chat 2020-08-02 12:26:38 oh the mantlet
creations-chat 2020-08-02 12:26:39 hmm
creations-chat 2020-08-02 12:27:05 huh
creations-chat 2020-08-02 12:27:06 oh
creations-chat 2020-08-02 12:27:08 yes
creations-chat 2020-08-02 12:28:27 i need to make the turret 1 block lower again
creations-chat 2020-08-02 12:28:44 
creations-chat 2020-08-02 12:29:12 ok then i will make a custom mantlet instead of using cylinders
creations-chat 2020-08-02 12:35:05 this doesnt look right
creations-chat 2020-08-02 12:36:45 if i move the breech down 1 block then i will be satisfied
creations-chat 2020-08-02 12:37:52 im doing the 1940 variant not 1939

creations-chat 2020-11-23 21:21:02 opinions on this plane? its custom but it may look quite similar to some other planes
creations-chat 2020-11-23 21:22:43 
creations-chat 2020-11-23 21:24:13 wdym you mean i should make custom landing gear?
creations-chat 2020-11-23 21:26:35 the plane is quite small tho if i tried i probably would have delete some rocket engines
creations-chat 2020-11-23 21:35:33 outlines
creations-chat 2020-11-24 09:12:09 opinions on this fuselage?
creations-chat 2020-11-24 09:13:39 thanks i got help from a friend to make that ill mention them when im done with the plane
creations-chat 2020-11-24 09:50:23 seems like i have to cancel it because i cant fit enough rocket boosters to actually make it go fast enough
creations-chat 2020-11-24 09:51:58 it did not react well to a conveyor engine it kept spinning around and glitching
help 2020-11-24 09:52:49 how do i make this thing go faster i have run out of space in terms of rocket boosters and when i place a conveyor engine it goes crazy and glitches out and spins around
help 2020-11-24 09:53:07 all i know is that its quite heavy
help 2020-11-24 09:55:08 could try that
help 2020-11-24 09:55:11 this is what happens
help 2020-11-24 09:55:33 yes
help 2020-11-24 09:56:32 also i cant place rockets where you said
help 2020-11-24 09:56:47 because those disconnectors arent a part of the plane when i disconnect
help 2020-11-24 09:56:57 only way i can use is the one i used while making my me262
help 2020-11-24 09:57:08 that is to motor lock the fuselage so they merge together
help 2020-11-24 09:57:15 i can place rockets to both parts
help 2020-11-24 09:57:18 so it doubles
help 2020-11-24 09:59:16 yes
help 2020-11-24 09:59:19 as they are supposed to
help 2020-11-24 09:59:48 they are only to keep the motors from locking until im able to turn the propellors to their positions
help 2020-11-24 10:00:22 like this
help 2020-11-24 10:03:36 i guess theres no way of fixing it anymore
help 2020-11-24 10:03:44 other than *that*

creations-chat 2020-11-24 10:17:31 i tried to do the same thing i did with my me262 but its not working in this one
help 2020-11-24 10:37:11 i've did this so far but it only reaches 300 max does anyone have an idea how can i add more thrusters?
help 2020-11-24 10:38:24 i tried that already
help 2020-11-24 10:38:31 doesnt work
help 2020-11-24 10:39:17 or atleast idk where exactly to put them
