bug-reports 2022-03-07 20:54:49 joined a public server when I saw a build I never built, can't be destroyed, able to place blocks on/in it, can't move it using the moving tool, and be saved or deleted, and I'm also able to load build on top of it and despawn. I've even tried blacklisting everyone in the server and it was still there. Images below.
