creations-chat 2020-05-06 18:53:19 is that
creations-chat 2020-05-06 18:53:50 blackhole bomb. it works just lika a real blackhole with some physics and magnet testing. it can also collapse lol
creations-chat 2020-05-06 18:54:18 when it collapses
creations-chat 2020-05-06 18:54:19 like
creations-chat 2020-05-06 18:54:25 all
creations-chat 2020-05-06 18:54:26 hell
creations-chat 2020-05-06 18:54:28 breaks loose
creations-chat 2020-05-06 18:57:24 
creations-chat 2020-05-06 18:57:26 it now glows
creations-chat 2020-05-06 20:55:24 im working on a mech currently and its already 1800 blocks and tis just for the head
creations-chat 2020-05-06 20:55:49 cool.
creations-chat 2020-05-06 20:56:02 yeah i found a way to make mechs that isnt dumb
creations-chat 2020-05-06 20:56:16 powered motor mechs i found to be slow and difficult
creations-chat 2020-05-06 20:56:31 so i found a way after someone suggested it to make a mech with only unpowered motors
creations-chat 2020-05-06 20:56:49 basically i made the knee joint move and then suspension n stuff to act as bracers and sort of "muscles"
creations-chat 2020-05-06 20:56:51 and boom.
creations-chat 2020-05-06 20:57:08 oh yeah you also put helium in the torso
creations-chat 2020-05-06 20:57:12 so it keeps it up
creations-chat 2020-05-06 20:57:20 and you use wing panels for stabilizing
creations-chat 2020-05-06 20:57:23 its difficult af.
creations-chat 2020-05-06 20:57:54 because instead of normally building the skeleton of your mech and then everything around it, with this you have to build the shell first and then the skeleton
creations-chat 2020-05-06 21:01:12 oof.
creations-chat 2020-05-06 21:02:03 yeah ive made 8 mechs, 4 were like mini-mechs
creations-chat 2020-05-06 21:03:03 its gunnna require the legs to be in a sitting position and the arms to be folded in half
creations-chat 2020-05-06 21:03:07 i can send a screen-shot
creations-chat 2020-05-06 21:03:49 
creations-chat 2020-05-06 21:03:59 That large
creations-chat 2020-05-06 21:04:01 aack
creations-chat 2020-05-06 21:04:17 Its also to be faithful to the original source materials tis from,
creations-chat 2020-05-06 21:04:22 so it has to be able to be deployed
creations-chat 2020-05-06 21:04:23 via water

-Finally, switching from slow pistons to a different mechanism that shoots the fists out for punching like in actual pacific rim.

bug-reports 2020-09-06 02:21:26 https://gyazo.com/e2a1d701b7cf3f3365599adfd802f609
bug-reports 2020-09-06 02:21:29 idk if it shows it
bug-reports 2020-09-06 02:21:32 but the pistons wig out
bug-reports 2020-09-06 02:21:38 
bug-reports 2020-09-06 02:21:39 and sometimes it does this
bug-reports 2020-09-06 02:21:40 and just
bug-reports 2020-09-06 02:21:43 kills everything
bug-reports 2020-09-06 02:22:13 and its killing my mech because i NEED the poseability for fighting and i cant exactly fight properly if i cant even reach my own chest..
bug-reports 2020-09-06 02:23:10 idfk if this has anything to do with it but it popped up in the dev console
bug-reports 2020-09-06 02:23:12 
bug-reports 2020-09-06 02:23:14 also thanks tooti
bug-reports 2020-09-06 02:25:07 it didnt happen on my other giant mech
bug-reports 2020-09-06 02:25:09 and only this one
bug-reports 2020-09-06 02:25:16 and it only started happening recently
bug-reports 2020-09-06 02:25:26 when it was just a small part of the arm it worked fine
bug-reports 2020-09-06 02:26:01 and decreasing weight SHOULD have no affect since it isnt the arm itself being buggy, its bugging out the fold ontop and the pistons inside
bug-reports 2020-09-06 02:26:10 
bug-reports 2020-09-06 02:26:12 this is how its folded

creations-chat 2020-09-12 04:19:34 I love breaking into people’s ships and stealing rockets n crap
creations-chat 2020-09-12 04:20:02 I once mined into a ship and cut a person’s seat out of the hull and ran off and drowned them

creations-chat 2020-09-12 04:23:36 <@!708185644706431038>  cherno alpha from pacific rim
creations-chat 2020-09-12 04:23:44 Full scale is impossible
creations-chat 2020-09-12 04:23:59 Mines 6 fold
creations-chat 2020-09-12 04:24:01 lol
creations-chat 2020-09-12 04:24:20 cherno alpha can PVP surprisingly
creations-chat 2020-09-12 04:24:33 I fought my friends carrier in the ocean since mine can walk in water
creations-chat 2020-09-12 04:24:45 I basically got my right arm blown off by a Yamato
creations-chat 2020-09-12 04:24:54 So I slammed my left arm on the front of the bow
creations-chat 2020-09-12 04:24:58 And flipped it over
creations-chat 2020-09-12 04:25:03 and then jumped on top of it
creations-chat 2020-09-12 04:25:14 And sunk it
creations-chat 2020-09-12 04:25:16 B)
creations-chat 2020-09-12 04:25:45 I’m a god at mechs but if you aren’t used to extremely complex key under you can use it
creations-chat 2020-09-12 04:26:51 Just for maneuvering my cherno alpha and all my other mechs use q, e, w, s, a, d, z, x, r, and f
creations-chat 2020-09-12 04:27:13 So I can pull some crazy maneuvers and put people into headlocks especially my PVP mech
creations-chat 2020-09-12 04:27:31 I once snapped a mechs head off with cutters along the side of my arms when I got it into a headlock
creations-chat 2020-09-12 04:27:37 my pvp mech is all physical

creations-chat 2020-09-12 04:27:57 <@!572411935669354528> in bed
creations-chat 2020-09-12 04:28:08 Also don’t use textures for it
creations-chat 2020-09-12 04:28:35 I don’t like when people use rust
creations-chat 2020-09-12 04:28:36 It’s bad
creations-chat 2020-09-12 04:28:44 Ugliest thexture
creations-chat 2020-09-12 04:28:49 You know when textures we need
creations-chat 2020-09-12 04:29:00 We need, force field, and every other texture
creations-chat 2020-09-12 04:29:26 We also need a tool that can adjust reflectance
creations-chat 2020-09-12 04:29:43 too far
creations-chat 2020-09-12 04:29:46 Ruins the game

creations-chat 2020-12-13 20:46:33 but i have a question for ya'll. should i do proper treads or fake treads. one is more laggier than the other and can severly impact the viability for it to function.
creations-chat 2020-12-13 20:48:34 my pc can handle it but its not about me, its about wether roblox can handle it or not lol. because server lag exists aswell, and i know tank treads can get laggy pretty fast from all the part collisions rather than in roblox studio where it'd just be an animated part with a standard car rig

creations-chat 2021-01-12 21:00:24 In general it’s to dark. The executor and the ravager were the standard imperial grey. And yeah the back is too short. Also imo you can add more detail n shit to the superstructure/city area, but in general it looks pretty good. Can’t wait to see it finished.

Edit: if you want extra points for shits in giggled or hof add the several hangars that’s on it and if you can maybe mini ties as small as you can make them. That’d be lit. Send me a picture with your engine block if you want critique on how it should look
creations-chat 2021-01-12 21:05:38 Follow official images. I can find a relatively accurate 3D model to follow for you. Also refer to my critique cuz I gave some more advice from a ship builder. https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/executor-b641f58d0b1046328b9300b0b48d779a (this one looks ok but your best bet is using official images from return of the Jedi)

help 2021-05-19 19:38:06 does anybody have a good locking mechanism that would work with a turret on say a battleship?

help 2021-05-19 19:38:24 making one with pistons breaks it from the sheer amount of motor locking on my battleship
help 2021-06-13 02:06:04 tryna make a single prop ww-2 inspired plane and apparently as expected plane crazy is unrealistic and the wings dont balance out the torque of the prop
help 2021-06-13 02:06:14 and decreasing the torque itself does nothing
help 2021-06-13 02:06:22 and adding a propeller to the back is ugly and unrealistic
help 2021-06-13 02:06:24 any ideas?
help 2021-06-13 02:07:13 or well tilt is a better
help 2021-06-13 02:07:15 word
help 2021-06-13 02:07:20 not a full rotation but i tilt
help 2021-06-13 02:07:38 i dont see a way to realistically keep the integrity of the fighter but also make it fly and look realistic

help 2021-06-13 02:13:17 also its only angled up because planes at the time landed like that. i made it fly without the propeller entirely fly straight

creations-chat 2021-12-20 00:55:55 i mean theres a good chance it probably looks super similar to something someone made but other than that ive been using GAU-8
creations-chat 2021-12-20 00:59:38 bro they look similar but not a copy you numbnut. i have sparklers in the middle and i dont have any of that back casing, and the whole assembly spins so whats your point???

its not like theres multiple methods for achieving a gun that looks like a GAU-8. pretty much only one way and if anything yours is better

creations-chat 2021-12-20 01:19:56 give opinions on the ship i posted in <#384025409945337856> please its my first proper ship that isnt dog shit
creations-chat 2021-12-20 01:27:26 thanks, the whole issue with rockets was  i wasnt sure how to hide without removing the ability to have an interior on my turrets, and also the destroyer is supposed to be small, hence the big biplane
creations-chat 2021-12-20 01:30:32 its a habit to crop things, also why is a stern torpedo bad just wondering, I mean i never saw it on real warships but i wanna know why its not good,
creations-chat 2021-12-20 01:32:54 ah alright. my next ship which is probably gunna be another destroyer, won't have that issue. though at the time i assumed it would be ok since i could fire it from the side
creations-chat 2021-12-20 01:34:56 i play warthunder, so that should be an explanation enough as to why im not knowledgeable in ship weapon placement. (because all naval is on warthunder is just aids and kamikaze attacks <:empty:794431705070174238> )
help 2021-12-20 01:35:25 just dont use suspension blocks imo making your own is better
help 2021-12-20 01:35:34 its fairly simple to make a decent design

creations-chat 2021-12-30 17:36:45 Regardless at the time due to the scale I built it at I had to use cylinder 2 2x2 which have the weird building bounding box and made treads difficult plus I intended on using this for pvp so using pistons to get precise spacing would be a bad idea
creations-chat 2021-12-30 17:38:47 I finished the tank awhile ago, and couldn’t add treads at that point so it just uses them like wheels and attempted to make up for it with detail though it’s not my best

Here it is. Mines somewhat similar to yours but I used suspension instead of strictly pistons on my wheels
creations-chat 2021-12-30 17:47:32 Oh I didn’t see the suspension, nice. I intend on later on returning to this and making a treaded version with the proper suspension systems

creations-chat 2022-04-08 00:45:10 <@!352986350565457921> that a wing is fairly good but it needs some work. the guns don't stick out as much and need to be less chunky, the engines are a bit iffy, the vertical stabilizers are angled inwards top and bottom slightly, and also don't end abruptly at the front, the crack in the center is more of a V than a cube, cockpit looks a bit big, landing gear are meh, the a wing is too thin and would be about half a block thicker, and on the side front their are vents present.

tldr; use a 3D model next time
creations-chat 2022-04-08 00:49:14 maybe a ton of builds under one theme is kinda meh, i would rather see you attempt to recreate something from the mystery flesh pit, something like this image from the official website

creations-chat 2022-05-14 21:50:20 i love it keep going it looks beautiful. i guarantee HOF for kamata-kun if its finished
events-chat 2022-05-15 13:16:42 No
events-chat 2022-05-15 13:17:05 Your not. I had 400 grav and also 2 full ballast beams because chomp is a heavy weight of 550 lbs in battlebots
events-chat 2022-05-15 17:49:42 it was great until jrst shows up
events-chat 2022-05-15 17:49:58 i wish we had rules limiting flippers because rounds end so early with his flippers
events-chat 2022-05-15 17:51:05 ok cheater
events-chat 2022-05-15 17:52:24 exactly
events-chat 2022-05-15 17:53:03 it should be an auto-disqual accident or not. 

im going to ask rbk for footage of madcat's fights and see if his spinner deaccelerated at all in any of them when hitting
events-chat 2022-05-15 17:53:41 (it should with low torque)
events-chat 2022-05-15 17:55:17 im sure i didnt because rbk checked both chomp and abrams over twice and he said it was good
events-chat 2022-05-15 17:56:20 it was supposed to be 5 but due to size and other factors rbk allowed a torque of 19.98 for the hammer
events-chat 2022-05-15 17:57:12 even if chomp didnt walk for mine atleast i did purposely limit it
events-chat 2022-05-15 17:58:34 i can look. im asking rbk for his footage to see if his motor deaccelerated at all when hitting, it should if the torque was as low as it should be.
events-chat 2022-05-15 18:18:47 <@315262125113081856> rbk showed me jrt's fight with yours
events-chat 2022-05-15 18:19:05 https://streamable.com/qvuunc
events-chat 2022-05-15 18:19:26 just watch, you can see his spinner never deaccelerating when hitting
events-chat 2022-05-15 18:19:45 and then theres this

https://streamable.com/jkrkav
events-chat 2022-05-15 18:20:02 ill let yall review yourself but
events-chat 2022-05-15 18:20:48 no duh but when comparing it to rbk's huge, his saw after hitting doesnt instantly start up. his takes a few seconds again
events-chat 2022-05-15 18:22:08 hm
events-chat 2022-05-15 18:22:25 hes not but ok.

events-chat 2022-05-15 18:24:37 bruh
events-chat 2022-05-15 18:26:29 no
events-chat 2022-05-15 18:26:50 my guy the whole event was around you building a battlebot that functions like the real thing. not do whatever fantasy land thing you want to do.
events-chat 2022-05-15 18:27:28 and before you say anything about chomp, i gave chomp wheels because walking was too difficult for my to do at the time and doing legs would just make it harder for myself to make a version of chomp that isnt massive
events-chat 2022-05-15 18:29:04 no? all it did was make it so i can build it smaller. chomp is about as slow as it would have been with legs. and the turret is the exact same. whats your point?
events-chat 2022-05-15 18:29:36 plus rbk approved that adjustment, last i checked he didnt approve your flippers
events-chat 2022-05-15 18:30:20 LETS GO I TOLD YOU
events-chat 2022-05-15 18:30:37 <@456226577798135808> W MOMENT LETS GO
events-chat 2022-05-15 18:31:04 i told you.
events-chat 2022-05-15 18:32:04 man, this event was a cluster fuck. next time we should have pre-battle checks and better more defined rules
events-chat 2022-05-15 18:32:31 theres a big difference between being inaccurate and adding a feature that isnt there
events-chat 2022-05-15 18:35:02 I hope the guy that had his win stolen wins. DNC that I lost I just want him to win
events-chat 2022-05-15 18:36:05 
events-chat 2022-05-15 18:36:50 1. High grav was approved
2. Nobody went over cutter limit.
3. What?
events-chat 2022-05-15 18:37:15 that last part was approved by rbk so take it to the boss

creations-chat 2022-05-26 18:14:07 Because they’re ass most likely. Excusing the few random downvoters, if someone’s downvoting they have a legitimate problem with your build.

creations-chat 2022-05-27 12:12:14 Well part of getting in to hof is having a good camera position. That’s the reason I lost HOF with cherno ages ago. they cried because they couldn’t see the legs under the water so
creations-chat 2022-05-27 12:14:33 obc told me it was declined because they couldn’t see the lower half of my legs because my only shot of the jaeger was walking in water. Though I do agree looking back on it now it is a bit ass and most of it comes down to me using 0 motorlock and also shitty folding
creations-chat 2022-05-27 12:16:42 When pc2 comes out I might make another cherno but for now with how broken my game is and how Rick refuses to fix it even if I reinstall roblox, im gunna wait. For big mechs motors will just not work even if I’m in 0g and have no anchor because of client side bugs.


Basically the same bug as what happened with my rockets and fireworks which still pisses me off. Don’t work if I’m moving
creations-chat 2022-05-27 12:19:13 true. I did say if pc2 isn’t out by the end of June I’m gunna dip from the game and move on cuz I’m tired of waiting

events-chat 2022-06-02 13:44:44 they all have to use tank tracks with a maximum of 4 individual tracks
events-chat 2022-06-02 13:45:19 Only one wheel powers the whole track, loss of movement in both tracks = death
events-chat 2022-06-02 13:45:36 it would be fun to do + basic tank tracks aren’t hard
events-chat 2022-06-02 13:46:29 Suspension isn’t necessary anyways since the terrain is flat on the train tracks

events-chat 2022-06-02 14:34:02 yeah but regardless it’ll still be an interesting event and give a chance for more advanced players (no whitenames or cheaters) to participate
events-chat 2022-06-02 15:08:40 Makes it more fun
events-chat 2022-06-02 15:09:08 Plus my og tonka-tank used tracks and had no flinging problems, just don’t make the tracks tight
events-chat 2022-06-02 15:09:33 That and only having 2 tracked vehicles spawned isn’t very laggy if there’s only one motor powering the drive train
events-chat 2022-06-02 15:10:36 That and there’s always the ability to make it a best 2 out of 3 situation for every fight
events-chat 2022-06-02 15:11:55 plus fights will be longer as people will take less risky fights than if they were using protected wheels

creations-chat 2022-06-02 23:49:21 True but the only issue is most no ranks provide useless critiques or hell get upset when their own build is critiqued. I don’t disregard no rank opinions. I’m jokingly racist towards whitenames

creations-chat 2022-06-07 14:25:16 yeah but still overrated and built.

I vote on the actual concept behind the build so if it’s overbuilt even if it’s good it’s a downvote, only exception is if there is something special to how it’s presented or designed

creations-chat 2022-07-01 01:11:57 1 wide planes are still bad though. lazy in design and boring to look at and also stupid as a concept, and an excuse to not add detail or build roscale

creations-chat 2022-07-02 21:19:31 ok what am i giving feedback for
creations-chat 2022-07-02 21:21:32 <@401530469952389130> colors look mid, could have some very slight weathering which would make it better aswell as making the color of that fuel jug a darker color, plus i feel as if the wheels and the body of the humvee are too far apart. looks good but those are just some changes i reccomend to make it 100% 10/10

creations-chat 2022-07-10 03:53:21 Me when I show the car enthusiast that their “V8” engine isn’t cool because a v12 exists and it’s in airplanes and also tanks (tank engines are also 10 times more powerful than a V8 and could propel a car of the same size much farther)
creations-chat 2022-07-10 04:02:07 Yeah you have the mental capacity of a goldfish. V12’s will be around for a long ass time because tanks exist
creations-chat 2022-07-10 04:08:24 I’m not talking about cars
creations-chat 2022-07-10 23:25:03 1 block wide is lazy simply put. because then you can summarize the hull instead of putting effort into a smooth accurate hull

contest-chat 2022-07-15 01:18:15 unpopular opinion: that helicopter that was just submitted is boring
contest-chat 2022-07-15 01:18:32 no, undetailed, you had a whole other 500 blocks you could've abused to make it better
contest-chat 2022-07-15 01:18:58 i will give the helicopter tiger thing credit, they used the max amount of blocks they were allowed
contest-chat 2022-07-15 01:19:11 if you want a better chance, sorry this might sound harsh but
contest-chat 2022-07-15 01:19:15 redo it but better
contest-chat 2022-07-15 01:20:49 still has problems
-unsmooth design which could be fixed easily
-boring lazy coloration
-no weathering of any kind to make it look used,
-the viewport is undetailed as fuck and makes it look like a chinese copy of a tiefighter without the signature octagonal viewport
contest-chat 2022-07-15 01:21:07 most of these issues require starting over/building at a bigger scale
contest-chat 2022-07-15 01:21:17 sorry but basically im saying, remake it but better
contest-chat 2022-07-15 01:21:20 i can
contest-chat 2022-07-15 01:21:31 ill make a tiefighter for the contest if you want to prove i could do one as good
contest-chat 2022-07-15 01:21:41 ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

contest-chat 2022-07-15 01:22:32 jeez
contest-chat 2022-07-15 01:23:08 its too small to do any weathering tbh
contest-chat 2022-07-15 01:23:33 personally i dont like to make my builds look like theyre right off assembly line sort of thing, i like to make it look lived in or used
contest-chat 2022-07-15 01:23:37 it looks so much better
contest-chat 2022-07-15 01:24:03 the tie defender is the best looking tie fighter tbh

contest-chat 2022-07-25 02:23:36 if you ever want i can help you make a better walking system
contest-chat 2022-07-25 02:28:18 well
contest-chat 2022-07-25 02:28:21 main suggestion is
contest-chat 2022-07-25 02:28:26 rely less on motor 2's
contest-chat 2022-07-25 02:28:35 and try to use wing panels to make the walking more organic
contest-chat 2022-07-25 02:28:49 and also, suspension is your best friend in inverse-knee mechs
contest-chat 2022-07-25 02:30:21 like
contest-chat 2022-07-25 02:30:24 its hard to explain but
contest-chat 2022-07-25 02:30:33 drag = slower movement in certain joints
contest-chat 2022-07-25 02:30:46 motor 2's are only reccomended for where the knee would be
contest-chat 2022-07-25 02:32:11 <@401530469952389130>
contest-chat 2022-07-25 02:32:17 its best to model the legs like you would a humans
contest-chat 2022-07-25 02:32:34 either make up or find where the human-related joints would be and it becomes much easier
contest-chat 2022-07-25 02:32:45 plus my gripe with your at-rt is the leg structure is
contest-chat 2022-07-25 02:32:48 almost nothing like it

creations-chat 2022-08-20 00:51:47 the arm ticks me off and i dont know why, just seeing the players arm makes it a billion times uglier and it pisses me off beyond belief

like if your gunna put the effort in to willingly embarress yourself by making a 1 wide (unless its the actual scale) atleast put a tiny bit more effort and remove the arms..

contest-chat 2022-08-20 04:06:07 Yeah so
contest-chat 2022-08-20 04:06:12 I’ve run into a  bit of an issue
contest-chat 2022-08-20 04:06:23 Physics
contest-chat 2022-08-20 04:06:43 I made an engine like yours not valve based but
contest-chat 2022-08-20 04:06:51 it struggled to bring it up a small hill
contest-chat 2022-08-20 04:07:03 And that’s when it’s only powering 1 drive wheel
contest-chat 2022-08-20 04:07:06 Yours
contest-chat 2022-08-20 04:07:14 We need a way to power 4
contest-chat 2022-08-20 04:07:20 Cuz I found out 4 is needed
contest-chat 2022-08-20 04:07:31 yeah it was inline so it did vibrate a bit but
contest-chat 2022-08-20 04:07:49 I need the 3 upper road wheels, the big wheel and the rear idler to rotate on each track
contest-chat 2022-08-20 04:07:50 Which
contest-chat 2022-08-20 04:07:56 I’m not 100% sure if that’s even possible
contest-chat 2022-08-20 04:09:24 so then why did it just
contest-chat 2022-08-20 04:09:25 not
contest-chat 2022-08-20 04:09:50 I’m off for the night
contest-chat 2022-08-20 04:09:58 cuz I got work tomorrow
contest-chat 2022-08-20 04:09:59 but
contest-chat 2022-08-20 04:10:11 How much torque does your engine produce
contest-chat 2022-08-20 04:10:15 Because I need a lot
contest-chat 2022-08-20 04:10:42 My tracks aren’t wide enough for intentional reasons so they struggle to grip even with just motors in use
contest-chat 2022-08-20 04:12:02 Can you do like a
contest-chat 2022-08-20 04:12:09 Pseudo test
contest-chat 2022-08-20 04:12:24 Because I don’t wanna make that complex engine and gearbox and just have it not be able to move under its own power
contest-chat 2022-08-20 04:12:30 ok that’s fine
contest-chat 2022-08-20 04:12:34 What time will you be on tomorrow
contest-chat 2022-08-20 04:12:45 I allocated enough space in my design in theory for the engine if not I can make more
contest-chat 2022-08-20 04:12:53 uhhh not the afternoon?
contest-chat 2022-08-20 04:13:09 i have the early morning shift and don’t finish till 11:00 am 🗿
contest-chat 2022-08-20 04:13:15 ok that works
contest-chat 2022-08-20 04:13:19 I’ll be in vip-1 at 5
contest-chat 2022-08-20 04:13:27 ill copy the engine and gearbox then
contest-chat 2022-08-20 04:13:32 Quick question though
contest-chat 2022-08-20 04:13:51 Do I need 2 engines 1 per track Mark 5 tank style
contest-chat 2022-08-20 04:13:54 Or no
contest-chat 2022-08-20 04:14:31 hopefully you can because
contest-chat 2022-08-20 04:14:49 Saying fitting 2 is hard is more than an understatement
contest-chat 2022-08-20 04:15:18 my brain died on that sentence
contest-chat 2022-08-20 04:15:55 Since I’m making everything full real should I make an auto loader for my 100mm howitzer
contest-chat 2022-08-20 04:16:05 I know an easy Russian style auto loader
contest-chat 2022-08-20 04:17:05 Well witj how large the turret will be I should have space for Atleast a 5 stage loader
contest-chat 2022-08-20 04:17:17 Worst case scenario I downgrade to a 76mm
contest-chat 2022-08-20 04:18:15 Or I can cheat a little and do a magazine style
contest-chat 2022-08-20 04:18:21 And just use shorter rounds
contest-chat 2022-08-20 04:18:37 Only issue is doing magazine style limits my elevation and depression

creations-chat 2022-08-20 15:30:12 Yeah that’s what I meant by it could be smaller. It ain’t powered by magnets or hover thrusters
creations-chat 2022-08-20 15:32:22 that’s hot.

I should try and make a full on tiger 2 running gear and tracks and see if I can make the over-engineered gearbox to go with it

contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:17:17 The exploit with .mov files is patched
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:17:30 that is steampunk
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:18:04 God damnt I’m gunna spam mov files

contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:19:43 Nah I don’t think so
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:19:56 not unless I make mine more steampunk because I think people are too picky
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:19:57 so
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:20:30 I’m gunna rework the coloring, detail more, give it a more dirty look and give it pin-shading and a dirt wash and make it look worn
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:20:35 So it’s more steampunk-y
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:20:56 Like what do you mean chunky
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:21:01 Are you talking about the mud
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:21:02 Oh
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:21:23 I can try but I am running into issues with block count
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:21:36 already at 11k blocks after optimizing too
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:21:37 So
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:21:45 and it gets pretty laggy past that
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:22:06 7-8k
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:22:16 Not my biggest build
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:22:43 my biggest was around 14-15k and it was when I was making a ship from warhammer
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:22:57 I tried optimizing by using beams and eveurhting but
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:23:09 Best I could do without effecting the look of coloring
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:23:36 People who post as early as possible scare me
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:24:04 like why don’t people just wait till the end and just, make the effort to keep improving and working on it with the extra time
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:24:07 Make it better
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:24:25 BLAAAHHHHHH

contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:25:39 People who do weathering and use colors more than 3 levels are crazy I
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:25:53 I only change the RGB values by 3 max up and down to get my weathering spectrum
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:26:08 Any more and it’s too much contrast
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:26:28 ngl having a tank and gunpla modeler’s mindset with painting plane crazy stuff helps
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:26:54 well, first off don’t even touch corroded metal
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:26:55 It’s ugly
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:27:01 Second off, no.
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:27:05 your colors contrast too much
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:27:10 go study color theory and get back to me

contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:28:43 The contest theme was *steampunk* and only *steampunk* no other sub genres or any of that that’s how this works
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:28:58 If you don’t like it then just don’t participate and suggest that theme after
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:29:15 you don’t understand the contest do you
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:29:54 <@697878770484510831> I’ll explain this once and only once. The concept idea was to take a 20th century vehicle car thing whatever, and make it look steampunk
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:30:28 You have 3 days then, you better make it good
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:30:35 2 individual submissions per person
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:30:36 But
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:30:41 i doubt he’ll make use of the 3 days

contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:31:27 They’re stubborn
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:33:28 Yeah I like the idea but half this server is Turkish and can’t read so
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:33:40 It’s like giving a dyslexic kid a presidential speech
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:34:03 Yeah you can’t read

contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:37:57 True though to a certain point it becomes obnoxious, sometimes it’s too much

contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:49:21 .mov files can’t be hacked anymore bruh
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:49:26 no reason discord patched it
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:49:55 <@466793357318815744> tell the mods to fix this shit because I can’t send any media files from  my phone because of it
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:52:41 Can’t send videos from my phone because iPhone automatically converts to mov and sends them as mov
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:52:50 And the bot blocks mov files for some reason
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:52:59 Even though the exploit involving them was patched awhile ago by discord

contest-chat 2022-08-30 11:20:38 <@928218139345420288> you know it’s supposed to be something that exists
contest-chat 2022-08-30 11:20:54 That doesn’t look like no airship from that century
contest-chat 2022-08-30 12:18:49 Ngl I think most people just
contest-chat 2022-08-30 12:18:55 Forgot about the 20th century part
contest-chat 2022-08-30 12:18:56 So
contest-chat 2022-08-30 12:19:04 at this point it doesn’t even matter
contest-chat 2022-08-30 13:01:32 no

creations-chat 2022-08-30 13:11:33 no weathering or anything, Atleast add slight color variation, maybe a difference of 2 in brightness and darkness so it looks like it has a pinwash if that makes sense
creations-chat 2022-08-30 13:23:29 we all start somewhere, it was shit but Atleast better than some other planes at the time
contest-chat 2022-08-30 14:27:18 yeah

contest-chat 2022-09-01 13:55:07 how
contest-chat 2022-09-01 13:55:09 he can’t
contest-chat 2022-09-01 13:55:11 not a mod
contest-chat 2022-09-01 13:55:25 Even then his panther is still really nice
contest-chat 2022-09-01 13:55:30 Even if he was a bit cheesy
contest-chat 2022-09-01 13:55:47 I haven’t heard from night in awhile sadly
contest-chat 2022-09-01 13:55:51 He was a fairly chill guy
contest-chat 2022-09-01 13:56:16 fair
contest-chat 2022-09-01 13:56:25 <@466793357318815744> are you gunna end the contest
contest-chat 2022-09-01 13:56:28 Or let someone end early bro
contest-chat 2022-09-01 14:23:19 Ah
contest-chat 2022-09-01 14:23:24 it be like that
creations-chat 2022-09-01 14:24:15 I mean it looks good but it’s an f104.. the f104 is super ugly already but
creations-chat 2022-09-01 16:14:57 50 cals are on the wrong side I think also you should have added a pintle mount MG. Including that sexy coincidence rangefinder is awesome though, you rarely see it
creations-chat 2022-09-01 16:17:28 I’m thinking of the t34 then, my bad. That or the t30 one of them has the 50’s swapped
creations-chat 2022-09-01 16:28:50 Added tracks can make a difference since it’s an extra 20-40mm of spare armor. And in a hull down or angled position it can make a hit you normally won’t survive, survivable
creations-chat 2022-09-01 17:11:11 Cry all you want, hull is not smooth at all, cheese grater wings, camo is not smooth and blocky, jet engines look ass, the AAM’s are just default rockets, and the cockpit/canopy isn’t accurate at all. That’s why I’m downvoting
creations-chat 2022-09-01 17:13:13 That too I could keep going but at that point it’s overkill to keep explaining why
creations-chat 2022-09-01 17:38:58 FYI your Hubble had no zoom. It’s possible with anglelock to make a proper scope that legitimately works. My anti-ship MAC gun has an adjustable manual sight
creations-chat 2022-09-01 18:14:03 Anglelock. Curving glass = magnification
contest-chat 2022-09-01 18:41:25 Rbk is a day late

creations-chat 2022-09-01 23:10:11 It’s an overbuilt build
creations-chat 2022-09-01 23:39:25 No?? It means it’s not original and it makes it boring. You know people rate your build off of its concept right?
creations-chat 2022-09-01 23:41:30 It’s good looking sure but you could’ve chosen something original mate, but you didn’t.
creations-chat 2022-09-01 23:46:42 someone’s mad my steampunk tank is winning.
Also your fine to build whatever but it’s still fine to rate a build off of its originality. Your logic is basically like saying if someone copied the Mona Lisa but almost a direct copy but with a monster energy in it does make it good

contest-chat 2022-09-08 02:21:33 Owned
contest-chat 2022-09-08 02:55:36 No
contest-chat 2022-09-08 02:57:01 Au-1 is the Corsair produced by vought, F2G is ford/Goodyear and F4U is whatever
contest-chat 2022-09-08 02:57:20 They’re all the same minus a few minor differences which are because of different manufactures
contest-chat 2022-09-08 10:52:24 They won’t win anyways
contest-chat 2022-09-08 10:52:28 so
contest-chat 2022-09-08 10:52:56 even if someone builds a really good a-10 it’ll lose anyways because of unoriginality
contest-chat 2022-09-08 14:01:54 You have no idea how scale works
contest-chat 2022-09-08 14:02:06 Personally I’d say no multi role only dedicated
contest-chat 2022-09-08 14:02:32 remove the grey areas so people don’t cheat
contest-chat 2022-09-08 14:03:03 The only exceptions should be stuff
contest-chat 2022-09-08 14:03:08 Like the f117
contest-chat 2022-09-08 14:03:15 Or the f111 aardvark
contest-chat 2022-09-08 14:03:38 attack/bombers are pretty much the same as a dedicated attack aircraft
contest-chat 2022-09-08 14:03:46 only difference is one lacks guns and the other doesn’t
contest-chat 2022-09-08 14:03:59 no
contest-chat 2022-09-08 14:04:11 f111 aardvark is a strike/attack plane
contest-chat 2022-09-08 14:04:26 American equivalent to the mig-27
contest-chat 2022-09-08 14:04:44 though your not wrong
contest-chat 2022-09-08 14:05:10 F111 was multirole in the fact that it had different models for different purposes such as an electronic warfare variant so if someone builds the ground attack model
contest-chat 2022-09-08 14:05:13 Then it’s ok
contest-chat 2022-09-08 16:06:29 Not player scale
contest-chat 2022-09-08 16:06:33 Too small
contest-chat 2022-09-08 16:06:41 You’d have to scale it up by half a block
contest-chat 2022-09-08 16:06:48 in all dimensions
creations-chat 2022-09-08 16:30:25 yo homie how old are you, just curious if your like not English as your first language or whatever
creations-chat 2022-09-08 16:32:46 oh what country dude <@982637637816950835>
contest-chat 2022-09-08 16:52:20 you forgot that
contest-chat 2022-09-08 16:52:25 there’s armor in the tank
contest-chat 2022-09-08 16:52:38 Sure if it’s like paper armor then yeah you can fit 5 dudes into that
contest-chat 2022-09-08 16:52:47 But the Sherman was a spacious tank,
contest-chat 2022-09-08 16:53:03 You’d have to scale yours by .55-.60
contest-chat 2022-09-08 16:53:15 in order for it to be accurate
contest-chat 2022-09-08 16:53:37 or in lamemens terms, scale it up by half
contest-chat 2022-09-08 16:53:57 which is wrong
creations-chat 2022-09-08 16:54:13 4 bladed propellers are easy
contest-chat 2022-09-08 16:54:25 1. That’s not how scale ratios work
contest-chat 2022-09-08 16:54:29 2. It’s inaccurate
contest-chat 2022-09-08 16:54:52 look at any multi crew tank combat game and you’ll have an idea as to how big tanks really are when compared to the roblox player
contest-chat 2022-09-08 16:55:10 (assuming the roblox player is an average middle man height of 5’5)
contest-chat 2022-09-08 16:55:57 block ≠ meter
contest-chat 2022-09-08 16:56:18 Though for buildings sake for non-roscale things 1 block = 1 meter is a workable scale if you wanna math out the proportions
contest-chat 2022-09-08 16:56:29 i do that for my builds to get precise angles
contest-chat 2022-09-08 16:56:35 thank Pythagorean theorem
contest-chat 2022-09-08 16:57:19 If your gunna do roscale,
contest-chat 2022-09-08 16:57:20 Do it
contest-chat 2022-09-08 16:57:30 send a screenshot of your progress
contest-chat 2022-09-08 16:57:44 easier to figure out if you got a roblox player next to it

contest-chat 2022-09-09 13:14:10 Unless your proven good at the game, making something custom is just a crutch

contest-chat 2022-09-13 03:08:26 Ill share it tomorrow
contest-chat 2022-09-13 03:08:34 Works decently well and keeps its angle of attack decently

contest-chat 2022-09-13 12:21:48 no problems
contest-chat 2022-09-13 12:22:11 the only thing is it has to be built for the explicit purpose of **attack or strike**
contest-chat 2022-09-13 12:22:18 If there’s any grey area it’s a no
creations-chat 2022-09-13 12:46:51 No he just reposts builds and is annoying sometimes. And also we are about the same skill level so that argument doesn’t apply + your not pug so respectfully, shutup and mind your business <:clueless:942802644043464734>
creations-chat 2022-09-13 12:49:34 you do not understand English my friend. I said he just reposts builds and *is annoying* not it’s. argument defused <:clueless:942802644043464734>

Also it’s not like he’s Darkz and everyone hates him, nobody genuinely hates him we just find him kinda annoying and reposting builds is kinda cringe in general unless you actually updated the build

the-dump 2022-09-14 00:27:27 breaking bad intro
contest-chat 2022-09-14 03:42:34 it is true but
contest-chat 2022-09-14 03:42:52 There’s a big difference between strike/attack fighters and pure fighters
contest-chat 2022-09-14 03:43:28 but for this case most fighters are multirole but for this contest to eliminate grey areas it’d prolly be best for no multirole period
contest-chat 2022-09-14 03:43:50 Because as mentioned above by someone else, then it gets sticky with stuff like the su-57 or the f-22 or f-35

contest-chat 2022-09-14 03:51:44 The phantom would not be allowed for the contest since

contest-chat 2022-09-18 19:41:02 the thing is
contest-chat 2022-09-18 19:41:10 theres no visible difference between the strike and fighter versions
contest-chat 2022-09-18 19:41:12 thats the issue
contest-chat 2022-09-18 19:41:38 its like building an f15, submitting it as an f15SE because there is no visible difference between the two minus small details

contest-chat 2022-09-18 20:37:22 that looks exactly the same
contest-chat 2022-09-18 20:37:27 just seems boring and cheesy to me
contest-chat 2022-09-18 20:37:45 + its not "dedicated" because its a modification of an existing plane to adapt it

creations-chat 2022-09-19 15:35:46 <@294980570885390346> looks good but my god those missiles completely ruin it. That and the color scheme is bland and for an all aluminum skin it’s way too clean, the nose is coloration is blocky and uneven and you should make the engines have interior detail
creations-chat 2022-09-19 15:39:38 If I were you I would just make missiles that look authentic and good instead of ones that work because unless your showing them working they’re not really necessary since your just showing image forms of the build

Overall well made build but a boring one.

contest-chat 2022-11-06 16:14:40 <@866848584888877077> would ornithopters count
contest-chat 2022-11-06 16:14:43 because its driven by a rotor
contest-chat 2022-11-06 16:15:06 but instead of the lift-generating "propeller" spinning a full 360 its spinning a smaller amount
contest-chat 2022-11-06 16:15:18 i already did once
contest-chat 2022-11-06 16:15:20 ill do it again

contest-chat 2022-11-06 16:18:08 only difference is a ornithopter like the ones in dune, which i will be making most likely, fly by flapping wings at a very high speed
contest-chat 2022-11-06 16:18:24 as opposed to spinning a propeller

events-chat 2022-11-08 04:28:17 no I just don’t like loophole abusers. The last event went to shit like last time because of loophole abusing
events-chat 2022-11-08 04:28:42 battlebots is honor system tournament, if you can’t follow them don’t participate
events-chat 2022-11-08 04:30:08 Yes that’s how you do layered armor on mechs but it’s super cheaty and I don’t think it should be allowed

events-chat 2022-11-08 04:30:49 do that it’ll be funny

events-chat 2022-11-08 04:32:52 Actually, now that I think about it, why not, just remove it from the rules
events-chat 2022-11-08 04:33:10 It’ll make fights longer and more of a slugfest so it’ll be more fun <@466793357318815744>

events-chat 2022-11-08 04:50:34 <@466793357318815744> here’s my idea, I take chomp right? And I make it it a spinner

events-chat 2022-11-08 04:52:56 Read
events-chat 2022-11-08 04:53:02 Stupid questions
events-chat 2022-11-08 04:53:15 if you won then no
events-chat 2022-11-08 04:53:27 hammers were not as fast last time either
events-chat 2022-11-08 04:54:49 I’m gunna be making a bot named PaK 40 and it’ll be my Abrams version of chomp but a spinner instead (gaming)
events-chat 2022-11-08 04:55:02 I’ll keep the really effective armor belt I made for chomp
events-chat 2022-11-08 04:55:51 take your argument to general bozos
events-chat 2022-11-08 05:05:41 
events-chat 2022-11-08 05:05:47 I don’t even moderate it
events-chat 2022-11-08 05:05:51 I just like bullying tooti
events-chat 2022-11-08 05:06:11 yeah rbk typo totally not mine
events-chat 2022-11-08 05:06:24 your talking?
events-chat 2022-11-08 05:06:54 or hear me out, I don’t care for grammar you absolute tongoloid
events-chat 2022-11-08 05:07:07 Walter white Jr headass @
events-chat 2022-11-08 05:07:20 more fun
events-chat 2022-11-08 05:07:27 Cutter armor should be banned though
events-chat 2022-11-08 05:07:32 Cutters can’t cut cutters head on
events-chat 2022-11-08 05:07:35 iirc
events-chat 2022-11-08 05:07:42 Only from the side
events-chat 2022-11-08 18:03:03 <@466793357318815744> so ive found minor issue
events-chat 2022-11-08 18:03:04 with torque
events-chat 2022-11-08 18:03:06 on spinners
events-chat 2022-11-08 18:03:08 heavy ones
events-chat 2022-11-08 18:03:11 what torque did huge have
events-chat 2022-11-08 18:03:17 beause i think the limit i set might be too low
events-chat 2022-11-08 18:03:28 1.5 makes any medium to heavy spinners impossible to spin fast
events-chat 2022-11-08 18:03:52 was testing the rules and found something
events-chat 2022-11-08 18:03:57 but
events-chat 2022-11-08 18:03:57 yeah cuz its big
events-chat 2022-11-08 18:04:15 when testing different blade sizes i found for heavy blades they spin slow as hell
events-chat 2022-11-08 18:04:32 your choice
events-chat 2022-11-08 18:04:35 i dont like rule bending
events-chat 2022-11-08 18:05:07 5 seems to work for me
events-chat 2022-11-08 18:05:11 maybe 7 max
events-chat 2022-11-08 18:05:12 something
events-chat 2022-11-08 18:05:13 idk
events-chat 2022-11-08 18:07:11 <:HOGRIDA:1006435257152716850>
events-chat 2022-11-08 18:07:12 oh yah
events-chat 2022-11-08 18:07:15 when are you back
events-chat 2022-11-08 18:07:19 i wanna show you the new armor i designed
events-chat 2022-11-08 18:10:29 ok
events-chat 2022-11-08 18:10:44 should we add a thing for
events-chat 2022-11-08 18:10:47 what class of bot
events-chat 2022-11-08 18:10:50 like spinner etc
events-chat 2022-11-08 18:11:01 i can do that
events-chat 2022-11-08 18:11:26 not sure
events-chat 2022-11-08 18:11:30 also i dont have an edit link
events-chat 2022-11-08 18:11:44 another row
events-chat 2022-11-08 18:11:55 ok
events-chat 2022-11-08 18:12:04 for ones that are multiple just put
events-chat 2022-11-08 18:12:12 "hybrid"
events-chat 2022-11-09 12:05:53 time to steal this design
events-chat 2022-11-09 12:05:57 <:HOGRIDA:1006435257152716850>
events-chat 2022-11-09 12:49:02 Yes but mind you it’s at rails
events-chat 2022-11-09 12:49:04 Limited space
events-chat 2022-11-09 12:49:18 And getting on the rails, even if it’s just a wheel starts the countdown
events-chat 2022-11-09 12:49:30 and your opponent can abuse your speed to launch you out
events-chat 2022-11-09 12:49:32 :)

events-chat 2022-11-09 15:59:46 you can do what rbk did last time
events-chat 2022-11-09 15:59:49 be the final fight
events-chat 2022-11-09 15:59:55 I was gunna offer to do that but
events-chat 2022-11-09 16:00:57 Pistons are allowed just don’t lock them
events-chat 2022-11-09 16:01:01 Otherwise it’s glitching
events-chat 2022-11-09 16:01:16 Or well using the glitch in combat
events-chat 2022-11-09 16:01:25 I wouldn’t use pistons though
events-chat 2022-11-09 16:01:33 Very easy to destroy
events-chat 2022-11-09 16:21:29 Good luck
events-chat 2022-11-09 16:21:44 If a bot is a heavy weight bot there’s not much you can do
events-chat 2022-11-10 12:03:24 I would armor the top my dude
events-chat 2022-11-10 12:03:36 Just like ice wave last event you are just asking for a knockout
events-chat 2022-11-10 12:03:50 One hit to the top and that bot is going flying
events-chat 2022-11-10 12:04:06 Slow down the spinning
events-chat 2022-11-10 12:04:25 For a big spinner max you need it going is 20
events-chat 2022-11-10 12:04:38 Anymore and it’s inefficient
creations-chat 2022-11-10 12:05:40 no you didn’t mid af expert rank headass 💀
events-chat 2022-11-10 18:57:01 lol yeah he does 3008 content
events-chat 2022-11-10 18:57:03 But who knows
events-chat 2022-11-10 18:57:11 Would be cool to have him commentate again
events-chat 2022-11-11 15:43:59 <@466793357318815744> when you get on today, I wanna show you the finished bot
events-chat 2022-11-11 15:44:09 I just gotta do some turret armoring, and color and I’m done
events-chat 2022-11-11 15:44:15 Besides fine tuning
events-chat 2022-11-11 16:32:06 I mean the hammer can consistently fling now
events-chat 2022-11-11 16:32:12 And it’s actually armored and heavier
events-chat 2022-11-11 16:32:51 what even is your bit
events-chat 2022-11-11 16:32:52 Bot
events-chat 2022-11-11 17:10:07 zero armor will make you lose lol
events-chat 2022-11-11 17:10:31 Atleast armor your blade
the-dump 2022-11-11 17:28:29 <@318892614378061824> I think your the stupid one

the-dump 2022-11-11 17:29:00 and then it’ll become the usual “deleted user #0000”
the-dump 2022-11-11 17:29:57 it’ll keep the tag of the original account for that week or so
the-dump 2022-11-11 17:30:09 discord doesn’t delete the pfp
the-dump 2022-11-11 17:30:19 So good chance bandgeek or whoever

events-chat 2022-11-14 17:14:51 And or record it
events-chat 2022-11-14 18:46:04 You said previously you own a computer did you not?
events-chat 2022-11-14 18:46:12 seems like an excuse in my eyes
events-chat 2022-11-14 18:46:22 It’s still a computer

creations-chat 2022-11-16 13:42:48 <@615232685916553218> you should add color detail, things such as fake shading, “pin washing” and also weathering and I think it’ll be perfect
events-chat 2022-11-16 17:02:16 It’s valid
events-chat 2022-11-16 17:02:20 Your bot is
events-chat 2022-11-16 17:02:31 Lacking in the creativity department
events-chat 2022-11-16 17:02:32 And colors

events-chat 2022-11-22 23:16:25 if those are cutters on your hull
events-chat 2022-11-22 23:16:27 you gotta remove them sorry
events-chat 2022-11-22 23:16:31 they count as cutter armor
events-chat 2022-11-22 23:16:52 only places you can put cutters is on a spinning tool/weapon, or a hammer or blade
events-chat 2022-11-22 23:16:58 aka anything moving in some way independent from the bot
creations-chat 2022-11-23 00:55:11 su-57 is a completed product. its just ass, get over it, they used wood screw in the wings and its just a redesigned su-27

also before you say no production-models have been produced, note that russia is poor, and cant make any of their new shit that theyve made because they simply cant afford it. T-14 armata, BMP-T, the list goes on
creations-chat 2022-11-23 01:05:26 Serial = post testing production, aka it’s complete

also prototypes wouldnt be listed as being in service, which the su-57 is listed as being in service
creations-chat 2022-11-23 01:07:28 proof? wheres your sources lol

also serial doesnt mean as in the plane had an ID, it means its in non-prototype production essentially, or in lamemens terms, a factory is making em
events-chat 2022-11-23 01:11:41 If I think it’s done in the form of armor you will still have to remove it
creations-chat 2022-11-23 02:02:33 You just said words where’s a link or screenshot..?
creations-chat 2022-11-23 02:08:50 Blueprints are inaccurate and only useful for reference, 3D models are better

events-chat 2022-11-24 15:33:34 ye
events-chat 2022-11-24 15:33:57 If you wanna keep the blade and the power but lose the flinging ability remove the hammer edge of the blade

contest-chat 2022-11-30 19:08:04 According to your rules
contest-chat 2022-11-30 19:08:15 I can submit my ornithopter if I finished it today
contest-chat 2022-11-30 19:08:34 and if my ornithopter was better you wouldn’t allow it
contest-chat 2022-11-30 19:08:38 You see the point?
contest-chat 2022-11-30 19:08:43 An exception for one applies to all
creations-chat 2022-11-30 19:10:22 I meant a proper piston engine with hovertrusters simulating a burn cycle
contest-chat 2022-11-30 19:13:57 I don’t even care about your Apache
contest-chat 2022-11-30 19:14:06 During the battlebot concept the same logic was applied
contest-chat 2022-11-30 19:14:20 nobody was given the exception
contest-chat 2022-11-30 19:14:45 Otherwise people would complain and say: “if he can do [blank] then so can I”
contest-chat 2022-11-30 19:15:46 Also <@559568621312147476> since gam3 brought it up, your Apache is good just needs color detail and more hull detail overall, like squad markings, weathering etc
contest-chat 2022-11-30 19:15:52 and maybe more detail with the weapons
contest-chat 2022-11-30 19:16:21 The rear propeller is kinda crap but the main rotor is good
contest-chat 2022-11-30 19:17:42 Oh wait nvm I forgot the Apache has a weird rear rotor
contest-chat 2022-11-30 19:17:47 nvm ignore that

contest-chat 2022-12-01 15:03:29 Allowing bobas sets a standard that builds started just before the competition are allowed to be submitted
contest-chat 2022-12-01 15:03:48 if that standard doesn’t apply despite what’s shown then remove boba’s
contest-chat 2022-12-01 15:03:58 Unfair to give one person a free pass and not the other

creations-chat 2023-01-05 15:14:31 Exactly, also there’s the issue that you’ll have to use so many trails to even get close to making it smooth and it’s still not smooth? Same with wings, I don’t think any aircraft with it is remotely expert rank worthy, your just filling a plot with repeating motorlock to make something mediocre.
