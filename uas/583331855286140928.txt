bot-central 2022-03-25 14:23:34 oof
creations-chat 2022-03-25 14:27:10 imagine
creations-chat 2022-03-25 14:30:26 its not easy to see it as an engine exhaust imo
creations-chat 2022-03-25 14:34:13 yeah maybe its just that
creations-chat 2022-03-28 08:32:14 Nice
creations-chat 2022-03-28 08:55:50 Lol can also mean 'laughing out loud'.
bot-central 2022-03-28 09:09:35 !rank
creations-chat 2022-03-28 09:13:14 The wings look good imo, but the front and the top don't have a nice shape
creations-chat 2022-03-28 09:16:28 I also think the colors need some improvement
creations-chat 2022-03-28 09:19:19 Rn it looks like grey and greyish red but the irl picture is more dark green and brown from the images I'm seeing here
creations-chat 2022-03-28 09:21:21 Yeah some times due to lighting it can look different.
creations-chat 2022-03-28 09:26:13 That might be hard to implement in such a small creation
creations-chat 2022-03-28 09:30:07 Yeah that looks good
creations-chat 2022-03-28 09:55:13 Very nice
creations-chat 2022-03-28 09:58:27 I like the use of sand to add texture
creations-chat 2022-03-28 10:18:14 Yes, roscale good
creations-chat 2022-03-28 10:39:03 The internet is filled with weebs of course theres gonna be anime stuff here
creations-chat 2022-03-28 11:11:37 People have a bias towards fashion over function. If you don't say that it doesn't work then they will just assume that it does. So if you want upvotes, just make something that looks really good. with that being said, if you state that it functions well then people will be less likely to downvote it.
creations-chat 2022-03-28 11:21:24 I prefer function over fashion. Making something that actually works is just so much better. Though afterwards I do try to make it look good.
creations-chat 2022-03-28 11:23:26 Roscale also feels more functional which is why I prefer that
creations-chat 2022-03-28 11:29:25 True, it can take a while before your build starts to look good. My first builds looked terrible, but I'm getting better now.
Plus new players don't know how every block works unless they test with it or watch a tutorial.
creations-chat 2022-03-28 12:14:03 Rip
help 2022-03-28 14:14:19 Blacklist everyone who could be the one causing it or check each one individually when they are on your plot and see which person it is as they will be teleported back to their plot.
help 2022-03-28 14:22:46 Are you building something functional or are you trying to replicate an irl vehicle?
bot-central 2022-03-28 14:24:59 ?rhelp
help 2022-03-28 14:25:48 I see
help 2022-03-28 14:26:18 Well I don't know much about mechanics unfortunately
help 2022-03-28 14:27:33 When I'm building something functional, I tend to keep things simple so there will be little that can go wrong.
creations-chat 2022-03-28 14:28:15 Lol
creations-chat 2022-03-29 06:08:06 929,544th
creations-chat 2022-03-29 07:31:51 From a quick Google search I looked at some images of this aircraft. I feel like the proportions of the wings compared to the hull could be better. Also add some colour to your build, people don't like uncolored builds.
creations-chat 2022-03-29 12:25:41 You could make a train.
help 2022-03-29 12:40:03 In what way does it destabilise?
help 2022-03-29 12:41:11 Maybe you can show a video of it destabilising
creations-chat 2022-03-29 12:42:28 There is a slight difference, but it's quite hard to tell
creations-chat 2022-03-29 12:51:00 Roscale best
creations-chat 2022-03-29 12:53:05 Your character is roscale, which means you hate your character aswell
creations-chat 2022-03-29 12:55:08 I see this as roscale
creations-chat 2022-03-29 13:06:02 If you want to make a functional train it has to be like 7 blocks wide, which isn't accurate to RL, but since it's the in-game scale/Roblox scale I consider it roscale, but not rlscale
help 2022-03-29 13:34:33 you need image perms and to get those you need to be lvl 3
help 2022-03-29 13:35:19 ok
bug-reports 2022-03-29 13:40:13 i believe that is just roblox rendering
creations-chat 2022-03-29 14:30:34 its an example
help 2022-03-29 18:39:13 what i think is the issue is that the centre of mass is at its lowest when capsized, so maybe lower the centre off mass and if that doesnt work try changing the angle of the hover blocks (i think youre using hover blocks right?)
help 2022-03-29 18:47:31 im highly certain that this is about the centre of mass being too high
help 2022-03-30 12:43:09 yw
help 2022-03-30 17:13:17 Airship or blimp
creations-chat 2022-03-31 14:19:38 Looks great.
Though maybe you should also add some longer containers.
