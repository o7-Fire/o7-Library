creations-chat 2021-08-06 04:58:22 The intake is way too big
creations-chat 2021-08-06 05:09:06 piston lock

when youre basing something off a plane it doesnt matter if it looks good or not it still should look like it
creations-chat 2021-08-06 05:11:22 and if it doesnt blend well then you need to make the fuselage shorter and skinnier
creations-chat 2021-08-06 05:13:43 not impossible to fix
creations-chat 2021-08-06 05:16:30 i cant tell you how if i didnt build every single block but if it were me i would delete the intakes and the entire side
creations-chat 2021-08-06 05:19:33 its not correct, and its possible to fit motorlock in 1 block wide space, you could try deleting the extra half block going out from it
creations-chat 2021-08-06 05:21:51 then just keep it how the real plane is while making the intake better?
creations-chat 2021-08-06 05:24:30 yes

<@!593249332262600725> if changing the intake of the plane messes up the back just fix the back
creations-chat 2021-08-06 05:28:47 dude the only thing u have to do is make the elevators smaller thats it

after making the fuselage 3 blocks wide instead of 4
creations-chat 2021-08-06 06:00:48 Our- nvm
creations-chat 2021-08-07 18:30:46 <@!736358133084979290> first off you should paint it, maybe light gray and faint blue. secondly you should reduce the control panels and ether make one big one using a motor 2 or only use the back row. you should try not to make the wings round and delete the weird bumps on the fuselage, and make it flat or replace with a spine, also angle the horizontal stabilizers

btw for the elevators delete every control panel, and use a motor 2 to spin the entire piece of the wing, its how modern jets work

creations-chat 2021-08-09 02:52:15 It is. There should only be 2 blocks in front of the turret, or you need to make the back longer
creations-chat 2021-08-09 02:56:05 i would say the exterior matters more but ok
creations-chat 2021-08-09 03:02:38 its 3 blocks from the front isnt it
creations-chat 2021-08-09 03:10:48 then make the back longer or make the front shorter

creations-chat 2022-08-19 19:54:32 Decals and paint is a no. My reference was the f-4ej kai II and had no decals, which im fine with. The paint is infact accurate. Im not changing the cylinder cockpit otherwise ill have to do way more for the support things. I know the electronic warfare looks a little bad, if i used half blocks i would need a piston, and theres no space to hide it in the 2 block wide part. I know i can work on the tail but i didnt really care and wanted to upload it
