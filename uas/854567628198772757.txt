creations-chat 2023-02-19 03:57:36 I would like to, but there just isn't enough space. I believe that 1/4th scale is the best scale you can construct it at because any smaller, it is impossible to add the fine and beautiful details in the towers construction, but not only that, building it at large scale allows for all the floors to be put in and all that other stuff. I do see your point though and I thank you for reaching out to me about that because I do get that question frequently. My first attempt was 18k blocks so I was able to cram a bit more detail off of my previous attempt.
creations-chat 2023-02-19 04:03:52 It took 4 months because it has every floor built into it, just the lobby alone took a week of planning and getting friends opinions of the "atmosphere" it created and ensuring that what I built wasn't going to be another common WTC attempt that we have all seen before, but a work of art that could be appreciated for the beauty and detail that I put into every square inch of the building. and then the addition and removal of different Ideas I had from friends like to build one of the reflecting pools in the place of where the other building would go to serve as remembrance to those who died during that day.
creations-chat 2023-02-19 04:08:52 I could do that I suppose, It's insane because my last attempt I got like 200 upvotes, got to go to the second stage and got so close to getting into HOF, but the judges said my photos didn't show the whole build so it got rejected. I hope it works this time. You can find my last attempt if you type WTC in the search and go back a  little bit. It was crazy getting that close and so it is an honor to hopefully have another shot at it this time...
creations-chat 2023-02-19 04:14:31 Thank you very much, I know it is a risky topic and idea to build around but there is still beauty in the architecture of these buildings, and I think it is one of the most important things to accomplish when building these buildings along with providing the respect to those who passed on that fateful day.
