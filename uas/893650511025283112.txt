bug-reports 2022-02-10 04:52:44 Speakers stop playing audio once i zoom out and zoom back in.
bug-reports 2022-02-10 04:54:08 And i cannot post video proof, great.
bug-reports 2022-02-10 10:34:19 You didnt read what i said properly. I zoom out and as soon as i zoom back in, the sound doesnt play, despite being on loop.
bug-reports 2022-02-10 10:34:32 I press the toggle keys, doesnt play either.
bug-reports 2022-02-10 10:43:04 Its never happened before, it started this morning and continued through the entire day.
bug-reports 2022-02-10 10:43:52 How though? I try to re toggle the noise and any other noise for that matter, and they dont play either.
bug-reports 2022-02-10 11:01:17 And what are those things it depends on?
bug-reports 2022-02-10 11:29:04 Glitch.
bug-reports 2022-02-10 11:54:15 Because i dont have perms because i just joined for help mate.
bug-reports 2022-02-10 11:56:02 I see, someone finally mentioned that there was an issue with them. Thank you.
bug-reports 2022-02-10 12:02:00 Some builds have the issue but some also do not.
bug-reports 2022-02-10 12:02:09 I have only discovered that recently.
bug-reports 2022-02-10 20:19:22 This is a bug report channel and I am reporting a bug. And yet you call me dumb, as said by jacekilla, Audio has permanence and continues to play when you zoom out and back in.
bug-reports 2022-02-10 20:19:26 Conversation ended.
bug-reports 2022-02-10 20:23:37 Same here.
bug-reports 2022-02-10 20:29:18 Well thats a fair enough fix, ill play without thruster noises until its gone.

creations-chat 2022-12-25 04:19:07 Suffering from success
creations-chat 2022-12-25 04:21:11 you can try setting a few motors to the same keys so you dont have to press so many buttons as well

and what is with this 2 minute timer even the <#384025409945337856>  doesnt have this slowmode

motor reset has been annoying the hell out of me because it goes asymmetrical
creations-chat 2022-12-25 04:25:28 who wants to see something trash
creations-chat 2022-12-25 04:27:36 bro this is what my ADF 11F used to look like before months of redoing it
creations-chat 2022-12-25 04:29:52 Damn how many blocks is that? I thought my 1.6K block plane was big
creations-chat 2022-12-25 04:32:04 Before you go ill ask one question

What is up with the slowmode here?
creations-chat 2022-12-25 04:37:14 You think you could make it the Rogue Nation F14?
creations-chat 2022-12-25 04:40:41 hidden 🤓  emoji (CIA classified)
help 2022-12-25 04:44:26 so im assuming your making an ADF 11, hows it going right now
creations-chat 2022-12-25 04:46:43 By far the best camo
help 2022-12-25 04:53:29 Alright, good luck on it
help 2022-12-25 04:53:39 And dont make the mistake of overlocking it like me
help 2022-12-25 04:53:48 It becomes a pain to make it perform decently
creations-chat 2022-12-25 05:31:59 Its kinda more a sudden straight transition, theres a little curve though
creations-chat 2022-12-25 05:38:15 Ive seen some before on youtube lol
creations-chat 2022-12-25 05:41:15 This shape is very annoying to make if your making a tiny one. Most of the time youd just have the entire wing move which makes it have a sharp edge and no small wings at the front because of how deltas work

Also all that motorlock was me angle locking 2 much
creations-chat 2022-12-25 05:43:59 True, hover drives kill my FPS in publics
creations-chat 2022-12-25 05:49:02 And heres a goofy work in progress HK Aerial (yes another one) using the Genysis design, and before you ask, NO i am not making that spider thing

creations-chat 2023-01-27 17:13:00 that f/a 18 is a masterpiece
creations-chat 2023-01-27 17:15:43 ok ill admit the shaders suck but the build is quite good probably hall of fame worthy if everyone wasnt so biased against real builds like that
whats a mirage 69420 and why does it matter in this situation? thats an F/A 18
creations-chat 2023-01-27 17:20:10 ive been forced to highlight the details
starting off with

engines
exposed lock
the sign with mcdonalds doodoo
those sick engines at the front (its a scifi F/A 18, so those engines make it look even more scifi)
fake maintenance person dummy to solidify the fact that this is an F/A 18, as F/A 18's need maintenance every now and then. since it is scifi, there is a crew member to fix stuff mid flight! cool as shit!

change my mind
