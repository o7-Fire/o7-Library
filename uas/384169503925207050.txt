the-dump 2022-04-16 22:24:47 north = 20 celcius = ok
the-dump 2022-04-16 22:24:56 south = oh man 20 celcius cold
the-dump 2022-04-16 22:25:56 that's like around 60-65 degrees fahrenheit I think
the-dump 2022-04-16 22:26:03 for context 70 degrees fahrenheit is comfortable
the-dump 2022-04-16 22:27:44 for some reason I feel like oolnubo is a troll
the-dump 2022-04-16 22:42:56 celcious is about 3x smaller than fahrenheit
the-dump 2022-04-16 22:43:09 20 celcious = around 60 or 70 fahrenheit
