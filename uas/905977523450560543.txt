bug-reports 2023-04-05 09:55:05 hover drives are broken
bug-reports 2023-04-05 09:55:08 not sure if its just me
bug-reports 2023-04-05 09:55:16 but whenever i spawn a build that uses them
bug-reports 2023-04-05 09:56:47 the build will either glitch out  on spawning, and my camera will sort of "drop", then return to place, and no matter how much i mash W, it wont move forward. and if i do manage to get it in the air before it glitches it will fly for a bit then do the camera glitch i mentioned, then it will drop like a lead balloon.
sort of like the build immediately gains a million trillion tonnes
and other glitch engines that should usually create a lot of speed dont work either :/
Not sure if its just me or not
