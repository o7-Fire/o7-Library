bug-reports 2021-09-05 09:27:19 I have a report!
bug-reports 2021-09-05 09:27:36 Motor 2 is bugged.
bug-reports 2021-09-05 09:31:48 When you put 180 degrees on motor 2, it will make F and R randomly have the same or different directions, I was building a giant spaceship with folding, and use motor 2, I apparently need to assist the mechanism to fold easier with rockets, yet I do not want any or all kinds of propulsion devices on my ship till I finish the design and other parts first, please try and fix it.

help 2021-09-05 10:26:45 Oh and, Mee6 says we should use "/rank" not "!rank", that is a sign of lazyness.
bug-reports 2021-09-05 10:40:24 The thing is it will be looser than motor 2, I cannot use regular motors they can easily unfold, motor 2 keeps a constant so when it unfolds by a some glitch or being hit, it will slowly come back to the normal position.

creations-chat 2022-01-28 14:15:08 What do you guys think of my builds I posted in <#384025409945337856>?
creations-chat 2022-02-01 16:23:46 This boi is about to go on a rampage, it will destroy.
creations-chat 2022-02-24 21:29:42 I need some feedback, is this a good car, it can drive and it can drift, it is loosely based on the Ae86.
creations-chat 2022-02-24 21:38:35 Maybe a bit farther away, and add a T section to the body to attach the engines.
creations-chat 2022-02-24 21:41:44 Make an extension to the side of the body like a sideways T for the engines.
creations-chat 2022-02-24 21:44:45 See the OG image, and how the body is made for the engines to attach, well add a sideways T frame, then put the engines, then build the shell around them.
creations-chat 2022-02-24 21:46:57 Sometimes when building a ship already made, you gotta make the frame then the components and last the shell, but make the components strong to lift with the shell on.

creations-chat 2022-03-28 16:48:25 I need something to prevent the wheels from folding.
contest-chat 2022-04-05 14:43:00 I have many ideas for spaceships, I have made my own book of basic shapes that I can build as a frame then make it into a basic form for my ships external greebling, engine placement, and even some interior work, the shape I chose was an H shape, I hope to finish in the next few days though or before the dead line.
contest-chat 2022-04-05 14:46:23 That or I might go for a knife shape, one of the 2, and by knife, I mean a vertical knife that has the seat at the top, or middle, half way down the hull.
contest-chat 2022-04-06 14:49:07 Its been 2 days since I have started working on my ship, and I love it, more needs to be done.
contest-chat 2022-04-07 10:49:16 RIP the AN-225 Antonov.
contest-chat 2022-04-07 10:52:17 Also I think I know how a shield bubble works.
contest-chat 2022-04-07 10:52:35 Its possible to build in real life.
contest-chat 2022-04-07 10:56:42 All we need is some powerful magnets that repel and attract, magnetic velocity gel that hardens on impact, and a lot of power to sustain such a structure, like fusion cores, the gel will be pushed to a certain distance while also being pulled back, so it will be locked into place.
contest-chat 2022-04-08 14:45:21 I am almost done, I cannot wait to show you guys the ship, I went for an H shape, if you look at the ship from a top down view, and draw a sort of skeleton of the ship, or an H, you will see it, just need some wings, rockets and landing gear.
contest-chat 2022-04-08 14:49:14 Is there a restriction against zero gravity?
contest-chat 2022-04-08 14:49:40 And hover engines?
contest-chat 2022-04-08 19:10:57 A contest can also have restrictions, and event usually will not have that many restrictions.
contest-chat 2022-04-08 19:11:52 I also asked if there were more restrictions not listed, I know this is a contest.
contest-chat 2022-04-09 14:33:35 Just finished my ship, wanna see it?
contest-chat 2022-04-09 14:34:21 Its a small ship so it was fast to build.
contest-chat 2022-04-09 14:36:34 The Helix Scout, manufactured by Helix.
contest-chat 2022-04-09 14:42:32 The ship has four rooms, the interior is done, but I mostly focused on the outside, there are more seats for those who want to ride, and it has working landing gear turning, no roll or any other kind of movement sadly, it can operate in low to zero gravity, and is fast going at 332 studs per second.
contest-chat 2022-04-09 14:44:17 I also have another ship to show soon, I also have the basic shape/frame ready to be used to build, cannot wait.
contest-chat 2022-04-09 14:45:23 I am using the triangle shape as the inspiration.
contest-chat 2022-04-09 14:50:18 Star Wars used the triangle shape for ships, because the shape was to give off the feeling of power.
contest-chat 2022-04-09 14:50:46 The Star Destroyer Class was the best example.
contest-chat 2022-04-09 14:54:30 Then you get one of my favorites, the best space yacht, the 890J from Star Citizen. I gotta say, its a beautiful ship.

contest-chat 2022-04-16 02:43:22 The newer show is just perfect, though I wish I could recreate the full Voltron combined mech and just fly around in Plane Crazy, maybe in PC2 I can do just that.
contest-chat 2022-04-16 02:46:44 Huh, at least if I did make it fly and even walk, it would be more of a monument to my hard work, but since things like the Lion is right now impossible for now, it will just have to wait.

help 2022-06-02 14:43:53 This guy here says otherwise, and I wonder what kind of crap they suffered, since they cannot be nice or say something nice, yes I know it is an opinion but to not start an argument, just do not say a thing if it is not nice, that kind of opinion to yourself please.
help 2022-06-02 14:46:56 I posted my mech after I built it, also no one ever called me a white name, since for the first few days of not posting and I got Expert Robotic Specialist.
help 2022-06-02 14:47:27 Here is the mech that got me my rank.
help 2022-06-02 14:48:35 Also I have not forgotten about you, what is your real answer?
help 2022-06-02 14:49:13 Ok, what have I ever done to you HMMMM?
help 2022-06-02 14:49:52 ITS A POD RACER, it is supposed to look like that.
help 2022-06-02 14:50:43 Ok, what do you think a pod racer is fundamentally?
help 2022-06-02 14:52:36 It hovers, it is fast and also has to have two engines that are connected by a coupler, a design is dictated by the components and aerodynamics, this pod racer is not to look like a specific one.
help 2022-06-02 14:54:11 This is not an answer that I asked for, I asked what a pod racer needs fundamentally to be called one.
help 2022-06-02 14:55:48 Fundaments, functions of a thing, and item with basic functions can be called fundaments that can be shared between different looking things that are classified the same.
help 2022-06-02 14:57:05 Well, I cannot make something look like it was welded with such details, nor scratching, carbon scoring on something that is made of blocks, since it is small.
help 2022-06-02 14:57:43 You try motor locking something like that and keep its balance.
help 2022-06-02 15:01:19 A lot more effort and difficulty, since motor locking with hover engines can be a balancing nightmare because the model design could be a problem, and also just to be clear, my pod racer is perfect anymore newer components could mess it up.
help 2022-06-02 15:02:16 What a solution that would do NOTHING.
help 2022-06-02 15:03:07 Ok, just let it be, all I cam here for is to classify it, you had to start this whole thing.
help 2022-06-02 15:03:39 You keep telling me to do more work with the build when I can fly it perfectly the way it is.
help 2022-06-02 15:05:47 Like when you are building something and you need help with classifying it, I will just be as rude and blunt about it, and say oh it is bad, even if you are still building it, I would not add a note saying when you finally finish it.
help 2022-06-02 15:06:52 Not yours, mister blunt block head.
help 2022-06-02 15:09:23 You weren't. [Grummn88} "What would my pod racer be classified as?" [vykmr}"bad"
help 2022-06-02 15:09:43 Is this helping me?
help 2022-06-02 15:12:36 Starting now, I am blocking you, since you said first time it was bad, and keep saying it is through out the whole time, and here and there you would follow what TheSmartFishy said, and nothing of your own volition.
help 2022-06-02 15:14:39 Yeah after you said something that could help me, and kept saying it was bad, so is saying something is bad and then following what someone else is saying and not something more constructive helping?
help 2022-06-02 15:16:14 I know that is why I came here to classify my pod racer and not get it called bad.
help 2022-06-02 15:17:40 As something of the real world, like a plane, a spaceship, a boat, or an experimental vehicle.
help 2022-06-02 15:18:04 Hovercraft?
help 2022-06-02 15:18:09 What?
help 2022-06-02 15:19:24 You came up with something to help me, but the other guy just followed what you said, agreed to what you said, and did not say something else to help but still said he helped, like really?
help 2022-06-02 15:20:26 What part of helping does calling someone's build bad first be considered be helping?
help 2022-06-02 15:21:15 I read, and when someone never respond, I said someone who is not an a$$.
help 2022-06-02 15:22:03 Well, I try not to.
help 2022-06-02 15:22:38 Key word try.
help 2022-06-02 15:24:38 Well, when no one else responded, I said someone who is not rude basically.
help 2022-06-02 15:25:39 And do I need to repeat myself on why some specific person was not helping me at all while another was?
help 2022-06-02 15:29:39 TheSmartFishy came up with something to help me, but the vykmr said my build was bad a second after me posting, asking "What would my pod racer be classified as?" and vykmr just followed what TheSmartFishy said, agreed to what TheSmartFishy said, and did not say something about what I should do to help but still said he helped, like really?
help 2022-06-02 15:30:47 One from someone I am not gonna enjoy.
help 2022-06-02 15:32:43 A list he never asked me first before TheSmartFishy did, the one who was nicer to me, and not calling my build bad right away.
help 2022-06-02 15:34:42 Well Ima forget vykmr said anything now.
help 2022-06-02 15:37:19 Oh yeah the list that you suggested one by one, and totally not TheSmartFishy who was actually helping me, you just quoted everything TheSmartFishy said.

bot-central 2022-06-06 15:39:09 ?suggest Ion and Hydrogen rockets, a new area outer space to use the new rockets, Ion works best in space, hydrogen works best in atmosphere, this can also be a good update to add the gravity boots/block idea, for the ball joint idea, add timer, and, or, X or, repeater, comparator gates so we can make the ball joints move at full potential, sensors for color and proximity, ball bearings to allow a build to have better configuration without using any glitches.
creations-chat 2022-06-07 09:26:55 B1-Sentry is getting a new pair of legs, and so far it is looking great, the legs that the mech will use are called digitigrade legs, most notable for their speed and jump force.
creations-chat 2022-06-07 13:35:53 My mechs legs are now built, time to put some functionality and paint it.
creations-chat 2022-06-07 13:41:25 Vykmr thinks he is giving "good advice" or "helping" others, but really he only just agrees to what someone else says that is actually helpful and says he is the one who said all of those helpful things, when really he calls someone's build bad or ass the second it was posted.
creations-chat 2022-06-07 13:45:31 Like me building a fun little pod racer as a side project with no real goal, and asking what I would classify it as one of the many vehicle classes, I never asked for help but vykmr just insisted.
creations-chat 2022-06-07 13:47:49 Because it is a good build? Dude tried his best, and honestly I do not see both of you doing something like that.
creations-chat 2022-06-07 13:51:14 In Plane Crazy, you really do not have much to work with, and even so, with motorlocking you still would not get any better than that.
creations-chat 2022-06-07 13:53:31 It looks the same, just at a different camera angle.
creations-chat 2022-06-07 13:55:37 Also has anyone seen my mech with its new legs? And I wish there was no slowmode.
creations-chat 2022-06-07 13:57:44 What- Ever
creations-chat 2022-06-07 14:00:21 First one is the old legs, second one is the new legs.
creations-chat 2022-06-07 14:03:19 I too play Bloxburg.
creations-chat 2022-06-07 14:07:52 Can that fly? Can you build that in PLANE CRAZY, not BLOXBURG, and does that A-10 have any relevancy to HOUSES? <@869034105625534474>
creations-chat 2022-06-07 14:11:57 I am still waiting till they add space to PC, maybe in PC2. For those without Gravity slider!!!

creations-chat 2022-06-07 14:37:28 I now need to make my mech here walk, I am calibrating the balance so it will walk and rest like it is in build mode.

creations-chat 2022-06-08 14:14:46 My mech walks really well, I am gonna have to redo the feet so the talons can stop folding under the feet, also I cannot wait to paint it after I make a few modifications.
help 2022-06-08 14:49:55 How many likes does a creation need to get into the hall of fame channel again?
help 2022-06-08 14:50:47 200? Was it 90 before?
help 2022-06-08 14:51:17 And I was so close at 86.
help 2022-06-08 15:04:10 OH, wait no, I am remembering the score for Expert designer.
help 2022-06-08 15:35:34 Yo, who ever even said you could predict the future? I can, with my mech, and probably other things.
help 2022-06-08 15:37:26 And I am close to getting Expert Designer V.
help 2022-06-08 15:40:48 86 - 90 Score, just a little more, but since then, I was able to make a completely new change to my mech. First image is the old version, second image is the new version.
help 2022-06-08 15:53:16 Whatever.
help 2022-06-08 15:54:59 I said, it is gonna get a paint scheme, and some details, did I ever say it was completely finished?
help 2022-06-08 15:57:01 You really do not need to say that, it is no use, since I am still working on it, and when it is finished completely, then I will post, you probably do not have skill at all to build a mech as fast as I did when making this one.
help 2022-06-08 15:57:39 Let alone making a mech like it.
help 2022-06-08 16:01:02 You just need to accept it that you are jealous that I have a mech with digitigrade legs, that can walk, and had more effort into it while still needing to be worked on, and if you say it is bad, just say something else other than "bad, ugly, low effort" or you will prove me right.
help 2022-06-08 16:02:47 Why? Because you called it bad, and I said nothing to you, never asked for you to say anything, and yet here you are, acting like Vykmr.
help 2022-06-08 16:03:43 Then act better then him, be useful.
help 2022-06-08 16:04:24 I have Expert Robotic Specialist.
help 2022-06-08 16:05:21 You should, since you are only one out of many who will think different, and also I am aiming for Expert Designer.
help 2022-06-08 16:06:27 But you forgot one thing, you have to add more blocks.
help 2022-06-08 16:08:11 Big legs to me = low effort no detail or any parts like a head, or different types of legs.
help 2022-06-08 16:09:35 This is digitigrade legs, they help make my mech fly, jump.
help 2022-06-08 16:10:27 Relevant to what we are talking about?
help 2022-06-08 16:10:31 No.
help 2022-06-08 16:11:10 I will ignore you now.
creations-chat 2022-06-09 12:13:52 <@567763933952475157> Shall I quote you? Since you said I do not have enough skill to add and finish my build here is something to refute that claim, the reason I have not painted the feet is, I will be redoing most of the feet.

creations-chat 2022-06-26 05:22:04 Guess what the name of the mech is, and who built it? Its a WIP btw.
creations-chat 2022-06-26 06:08:52 Ok, since no one knew what the mech was supposed to be, from the unique shape, or design, the character/mech I am making is General Franky, the Iron Pirate of the Straw Hats, from One Piece.

The mech is SUUUPER.
creations-chat 2022-06-27 03:26:09 This mech is becoming SUUUUUPER.
creations-chat 2022-06-27 03:31:12 <@812453587065372703>.
creations-chat 2022-06-27 03:49:05 Thats because this mech was made this way, do not ask me why, ask Toei, or Eiichiro Oda, also, the arms were painted, soon I will do the hands.
creations-chat 2022-06-27 04:08:18 Your name color is not far off, pink.
To me its pink.
creations-chat 2022-06-27 21:08:24 Boom, General Franky, the Iron Pirate!!!
creations-chat 2022-06-28 05:28:16 Drama be like.

creations-chat 2022-06-30 20:51:41 Man it sucks that you have no skill to recreate a character or vehicle so you talk trash about others to drag them down, what a waste of my time to even type this out.
You cannot make a paragraph always sound like a joke, and using the troll face does not help either since a lot of other toxic people uses it too.
creations-chat 2022-06-30 20:56:19 " man it sucks that you do not have skill because you suck yes  and you are shit at thsi game "  Are you blind? The reason I said "Man it sucks that you have no skill to recreate a character or vehicle so you talk trash about others to drag them down" is because there are so many toxic, hate everything players in this server, who uses troll face, and cannot say something else other than bad, ass, crap, trash.
creations-chat 2022-06-30 21:00:29 Did you not see what I said? Why I took what btd_bad10TrainsAcc said seriously? There are too many players who say, the standards for builds have gone down, or when someone posts a new build, another would hop over to see and instantly say its bad, so in that case I took it seriously since he could have been one of them, using the troll face, and saying nothing else but trash.
creations-chat 2022-06-30 21:05:41 Bruh.
creations-chat 2022-07-12 01:24:01 B1-Sentry just got new guns, Large Rapid-Fire, anti air/ground rounds.
creations-chat 2022-07-12 01:26:27 Thank you! <@866848584888877077>, well the mech is off the assembly line new.
creations-chat 2022-07-12 01:30:13 The mech is too big, but I may try doing it another way, I do not know if it is possible to do, but cropping the mech out and make a new build, like a hanger/launch hanger.

creations-chat 2022-07-31 07:12:18 I just went through all of the recent argument, and its cringe, Robert is being cringe for saying kid way too much, and has no idea what he said before, he said he would knock everyone down, when no one said they would do any physical harm to him wow, I am gonna need an inhaler for this one, because all of those messages from Robert were taking all of the oxygen outta my tank.
creations-chat 2022-07-31 07:15:11 Idk, maybe he was actually like that, and just has really bad cognitive dissonance.
creations-chat 2022-07-31 07:19:42 Like posting a build that was not that good, then people giving their own criticism and then him lashing out, saying he was bullied, and then he says he would do physical harm to those who were just mocking him with words that can make a super soaker look like a RPG.
creations-chat 2022-07-31 07:24:37 Btw do you have a good name for my WIP cargo transport spaceship?
creations-chat 2022-07-31 07:27:03 C-367, is a good part, but here is some of the things I saw in it looking like, a shark, and the arbiter from Halo.
creations-chat 2022-07-31 07:29:06 Well, I need a name that can also project its power to lift cargo crates.
creations-chat 2022-07-31 07:32:28 Helix StarLifter.
creations-chat 2022-07-31 07:47:27 I have a ship called the Red Storm and right now it does not have a ship construction brand, like car manufactures but for spaceships, and I have a few brands I made up, Helix is a company that makes light ships for most of the tasks, one of them you just saw got named, Helix needed a cargo ship class, then there is Bulk, the lockheed martin of ships, they build military class ships, cargo and or ships for offensive combat, Galaxy is a ship brand for making luxury cruisers.
Here is Red Storm.
creations-chat 2022-07-31 11:09:12 Idk man, would you uphold loyalty over anything else so you do not get some people wanting you gone? Or would you turn a blind eye for a friend, I would not be too harsh, but when it comes to being a person wanting a position of any power given, you might need to prove yourself, assuming you are serious.
creations-chat 2022-07-31 11:11:24 You would need a little more than just words, you need to hold your ground and do something about it, or report them to mods, and not just say "stop", make a log of all the people who break the rules and are just being too much for this channel.

help 2022-08-02 07:43:07 Something in my mech broke, and I did nothing to it though, I think Plane Crazy is broken right now, because the balance of the helium and balast blocks are off by a long shot.
help 2022-08-02 07:47:28 I think the devs changed how strong helium blocks are.
bug-reports 2022-08-02 07:51:32 Helium blocks just got stronger, and now all of my builds like my mechs are now wonky, please fix this.
bug-reports 2022-08-02 07:54:04 THIS CHANGE TO HOW HELIUM BLOCKS WORK IS A PAIN!!!
bug-reports 2022-08-02 07:56:46 I have to go through all of my mechs to rework them now which were all perfect from before, and fix them, <@&706009538897117185>, this new change will cause a large dip in players online, and I am one of them now, since the old system of helium blocks was not good enough, thanks guys, its been fun, cannot wait to see more players like me leave too.

bug-reports 2022-08-02 08:12:45 Like you do not understand, this new change, that IDK is a bug or not, will be the BIGGEST pain in all of us mech builders since we used the older system.
help 2022-08-02 08:37:02 Because those who built mechs and other vehicles using helium blocks have to go through fixing their builds that were already perfect, and the devs made a dumb choice for changing the system, when they can add a new setting for helium blocks to make it easier for me and those who are having the same problem.
bug-reports 2022-08-02 16:33:33 Omg, are you gonna fix it?
bug-reports 2022-08-02 16:33:41 Please?
bug-reports 2022-08-02 16:34:23 If so, I will hop on, and continue building mechs.

bug-reports 2022-08-02 16:50:41 It was perfect before, and now its ruined 😭
bug-reports 2022-08-02 16:50:56 My beautiful mech😭
bug-reports 2022-08-02 16:51:36 Ballast?
bug-reports 2022-08-02 16:52:24 Its like some of the blocks were changed, out of nowhere too, and how much they weigh.
bug-reports 2022-08-02 16:53:35 That or the grav slider is off and the whole game is just dealing with it?
bug-reports 2022-08-02 16:53:46 Nope.
bug-reports 2022-08-03 08:39:49 Its not just ballast blocks, I think its an overall glitch that happens to a bunch of blocks, like wings, helium and ballast.
bug-reports 2022-08-03 08:41:43 Also if Rickje139 cannot fix this glitch, its better to assume he could try and release PC2 and ask that we all just be mindful and understanding of the situation.
bug-reports 2022-08-03 08:42:21 And I will soon get a new PC, and buy Space Engineers.
creations-chat 2022-08-12 13:11:26 When B1-Sentry gets its own assembly, maintenance and holding area.
bug-reports 2022-08-13 17:40:43 So I was walking around in my mech, and sometimes the legs do not want to lift up, even though there are rockets trying to lift it up, I think it most be the ballast blocks, or it could be the fabric material, and the way fabric reacts to the environment, like the fabric blocks are rubbing against the air, or each other, that and also maybe the something is happening between both the fabric material and ballast blocks.
bug-reports 2022-08-13 20:35:58 I cannot, I need nitro to upload full vid, and it only happens when, well I do not know when or why it happens.
bug-reports 2022-08-13 20:42:04 I cannot right now, I am building a new vehicle I want to finish.
bug-reports 2022-08-13 20:43:11 "I am building a new vehicle I want to finish" Need I say more?
bug-reports 2022-08-13 20:48:18 And I was building a new vehicle, can you not understand?
bug-reports 2022-08-13 20:53:54 Its either I do one or the other, looking up a site to use it, or building a new vehicle, one or the other, and both can take time anyway since I would have to keep walking in my mech, just to see the legs acting up, all while recording it, just so I can make the video fit so I can upload, just to only be blocked by the bot for uploading a vid that PCC server does not support, or I just spend less time overall building something that is worth more time to work on since its so complicated.
bug-reports 2022-08-13 20:55:41 Spending less time on a build that is worth more time, meaning, I could be done with it faster than me getting a video, and editing it.
bug-reports 2022-08-13 20:57:23 Calling me a nerd, wow, so much simpler than I am.
bug-reports 2022-08-13 21:02:24 At least I am less miserable than you, and I have glaucoma, my eyes are slowing losing peripheral vision, and I am still having more fun with the short amount of time I've got, I came here to tell someone what is happening short and simple, and that someone is a helper/dev and you do not seem like a dev to me.
bug-reports 2022-08-13 21:03:52 Shredders are not bugs, they are builds that are annoying.
bug-reports 2022-08-13 21:05:37 At least you can see the world, while I am gonna soon be completely blind, meaning I will never get to finish my stuff I will have then, I have it worse, because I can see now, but going blind will ruin everything for me.
bug-reports 2022-08-13 21:07:27 Me not having to do something that I did not ask for directions to, and how I just said what I experienced about my mech being short and simple, seeing if someone else has the same problem.
bug-reports 2022-08-13 21:09:02 Seems like a lot of people will be doing that, since I am not used to having to rely on someone else for walking, or some stick I have to wave around in front of me for the rest of my life.
creations-chat 2022-08-21 02:59:10 I just tested out a way to steer my car, and this is how I made it look like IRL steering, almost, instead of turning the wheel from the end of the suspension closest to the inside of the frame, we put the steering motors over the wheels.
creations-chat 2022-08-21 03:01:55 If anyone knows a way to fix the steering while keeping the way it does, that would be nice, though it would be really complicated to make.
creations-chat 2022-08-21 03:03:59 When you make a car, the engine is usually above or behind the steering mechanism.

creations-chat 2022-09-09 11:27:43 Can you really back that up, when <@883063424614006878> was doing their best building a jet, whitenames really need to get expert roles and colored names.
creations-chat 2022-09-09 11:30:13 Whitename says wha-???

<@883063424614006878>, understandable, since you were probably busy with something else?

<@876288263386714163>, yep.
creations-chat 2022-09-09 11:32:41 Not that, its that a lot of whitenames without expert roles, or no roles at all, keep coming in, and just says the dumbest things ever about decent builds, without a shred of proof of their own skills being shown.
creations-chat 2022-09-09 11:34:43 Most of the time, since we spend more than a day or so making builds.
creations-chat 2022-09-09 11:36:52 Use your brain, and think about about what you just said, I did not mean days in a row, I meant builds having days spent on it, and other days off game.
Plus I spend more than 6hrs helping my dad build his dream cabin in the woods.
creations-chat 2022-09-09 11:39:53 Oh yeah it does, time is like something of a currency you spent on something new, and sometimes had to go through rigorous testing on something that can at best be complicated.
Sure its a game, but it still took time to make.
creations-chat 2022-09-09 11:41:56 For not having any reason for making some stupid remarks of a persons build, decent ones at that.
creations-chat 2022-09-09 11:44:12 I ask of all whitenames to at least have an understanding of an artists perspective of a creation.
creations-chat 2022-09-09 11:46:18 Pretty darn realistic, keep up the good work man.
Can you add a custom livery?
creations-chat 2022-09-09 11:48:49 That is if you want so many other players hating your builds you receive a creations blacklist because you do not realize you have made your impression as a rude builder here, and once you have a bunch of Expert roles, and post some of your creations in the server, you will have the same problem as I and so many other do, well that is it for now, Ima hop off.
creations-chat 2022-09-13 06:17:50 For real, I use proper grammar, because that is how I want to be, and how I was taught, it is like questioning the way you look with some disease that deforms the face.

creations-chat 2022-10-03 07:16:36 Monster trucks have a weird proportion of each part, the chassis is long, the wheels are fat.

The gradient does look nice right?
