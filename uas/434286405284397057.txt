creations-chat 2021-04-09 14:43:40 its a rule to not post wips in creations
creations-chat 2021-04-09 16:15:45 lets be honest we are all tryhards here that enjoy shaming people becuase they dont fit our standards and thats why this is so fun
creations-chat 2021-04-09 16:32:12 yea if we werent this toxic then there would be way more builds that are actually horrible
creations-chat 2021-04-10 19:21:04 <:KEKW:670310537300672528>

Looks like something made in minecraft and the mast and deck look empty and undetailed <@!619595458498789395>
creations-chat 2021-04-10 19:33:58 wedges exist btw
creations-chat 2021-04-10 19:42:15 someone asking why you downvoted is probably the most cringe worthy thing that can happen in this server <:trollface:775024642104229898>

in dms i mean
creations-chat 2021-04-10 19:45:27 if you say something like "what can i do to improve this" thats fine but dont go into peoples dms because they downvoted you
creations-chat 2021-04-14 13:27:09 good luck with the angled side skirts
creations-chat 2021-04-14 14:34:09 put something like pontoons
creations-chat 2021-04-14 15:08:08 shading some more detail and the colors look bad
creations-chat 2021-04-14 15:12:18 i mean that dont just use the basic white it looks horrible and add shading instead of just the flat color
creations-chat 2021-04-14 16:38:04 man that apache looks horrible, the rotors are too short exposed motolock exposed prepellers trash paintjob and looks like a tutorial
creations-chat 2021-04-14 21:52:53 <@!699039068633301082> iowa with german turrets <:empty:794431705070174238>
creations-chat 2021-04-14 21:57:08 its just a heavy cruiser turret/ any other german battleship
the bismarck isnt the only german ship
creations-chat 2021-04-15 19:15:10 nothing we just like being assholes
creations-chat 2021-04-18 03:28:25 that looks decent
creations-chat 2021-04-19 00:05:12 <@456226577798135808> dont be shy, show us a pic from the front
creations-chat 2021-04-20 11:58:00 its supposed to be a walker not a car with legs on top

creations-chat 2021-04-20 12:02:52 its a walker make it walk, and if if you have any skill you should know how to make it look decent and be pvp effective
creations-chat 2021-04-20 13:47:13 the mig 21 kid deleted the post <:KEKW:670310537300672528>
creations-chat 2021-04-20 14:09:46 waaaaa he sworeeee
creations-chat 2021-04-21 12:00:21 excuse me how did this thing get over 30 upvotes?

shape is horrible wing shape is bad fuselage is out of proportion no shading and exposed motorlock
creations-chat 2021-04-21 12:03:40 it is decent but this thing is only getting upvotes because it looks complex and no one can debate on that
creations-chat 2021-04-21 12:41:57 it is
creations-chat 2021-04-21 13:41:59 im not personally insulting him im just sayign that this server only likes overcomplicated stuff and votes based on that
creations-chat 2021-04-21 13:47:14 well yes but yes
your f104 is the same case, only complexity
creations-chat 2021-04-21 15:36:12 make a giant churchill tank
creations-chat 2021-04-21 16:16:03 looks overcomplicated so you will probably get a lot of upvotes
creations-chat 2021-04-22 16:56:29 not as oversized as the ones on your bf109 <:KEKW:670310537300672528>
creations-chat 2021-04-22 16:58:52 <:KEKW:670310537300672528>
creations-chat 2021-04-23 15:21:22 maybe some shading and remove the cheese grater wings
looks decent dont listen to that arse
help 2021-04-25 20:06:18 does anyone know how to stop motor 2s getting stuck?
help 2021-04-25 20:06:22 for a tank turret
help 2021-04-25 21:00:54 nvm i fixed it
creations-chat 2021-04-26 16:46:16 once you start looking at the details it just gets worse

maybe you could try to make the control surfaces hidded with motorlock instead of using control sufaces
creations-chat 2021-04-26 16:51:47 i dont know how your plane works but the gap is the main issue
creations-chat 2021-04-26 17:17:27 designer is still harder to get than terrain, air etc expert since you need people to actually like your builds, and chances are people will like your build if it looks good or looks like it took skill to make
creations-chat 2021-05-06 14:33:43 shading
creations-chat 2021-05-14 21:22:02 <@!376309548761481217> ayo can you tell me how you did that russian navy flag?

sick yak 38 btw
creations-chat 2021-05-25 22:04:55 pretty good
creations-chat 2021-05-25 22:08:42 on this episode of people crying over downvotes
creations-chat 2021-05-28 01:53:34 thats a stall not a cobra, in a real  cobra the plane drifts forward, in yours it just goes up, stalls then goes to a side without even going back to its previous flight path, very much just a stall
creations-chat 2021-05-28 01:55:40 the fact that you recorded a whole ass video just so people could prove you even more wrong is hilarious <:KEKW:670310537300672528>
creations-chat 2021-06-16 20:15:28 kids trying to hype up a trash build be like
creations-chat 2021-06-16 20:18:48 "can do the pugachevs cobra" how much do you want to bet that he just pulls up and stalls then calls it a cobra <:KEKW:670310537300672528>
creations-chat 2021-06-21 15:58:56 <@456226577798135808> did you actually just post madvulpen's a10 and how is it still not removed
creations-chat 2021-06-21 17:03:14 the first one is a joke and it was posted by a bot/mod and yours just looks like crap (its just satire)
creations-chat 2021-07-07 22:52:56 can i get some feedback for my sk60 (things that can be fixed without remaking)
help 2021-07-07 23:27:21 anyone know how to fix the sparklers spinning glithc
help 2021-07-07 23:27:33 when you save and load the sparklers change direction
creations-chat 2021-09-29 23:28:32 well i for sure hate them but regaldless of that its still shit pixelart
creations-chat 2021-09-30 00:19:39 the exposed motorlock is should be the least of your worries <:KEKW:670310537300672528>
creations-chat 2021-09-30 00:22:27 do you want me to tell you everything that is wrong? i can
creations-chat 2021-09-30 00:26:39 ok so first of all its very sharp and janky try to make it smoother, second the proportions are quite off try using paint 3d to overlay a blueprint of the real thing on your version, third try to make the stabilizers closer to the fuselage by either using piston lock or just locking them by half a block
creations-chat 2021-10-15 01:39:08 social credit points +100
creations-chat 2021-11-17 11:15:09 Even when you dont ask for it
creations-chat 2021-11-17 11:18:43 I dont care about upvotes or downvotes but when someone writes a whole essay  about how a single block in your build is unrealistic is kinda annoying
creations-chat 2021-11-17 20:14:20 roasted 🥶
creations-chat 2021-11-17 20:17:20 bro really went for pfps 😔
creations-chat 2021-11-17 20:19:42 yooo btd its me ericvidz7482
this is my alt account
creations-chat 2021-11-17 20:21:54 we made fun of some kid i think
creations-chat 2021-11-17 20:24:10 true true

i dont think i have any of the builds i had back then
creations-chat 2021-11-25 10:10:08 did that one kyle rittenhouse pixelart/mural get deleted?
creations-chat 2021-11-25 10:12:32 shame 😔
creations-chat 2021-12-13 15:40:24 post something better than a pvp spam turret and a shitty music spam thing ffs
creations-chat 2022-01-01 23:35:03 cheesegrater wings, very wonky and irregular looking, a lot of blocks in wings which you can fix by motorlocking signs and trapdoors a lot of things are out of proportion with the scale, the canopys shape could be better and a lot of unnescesarily exposed blocks and motors.
creations-chat 2022-01-12 00:36:54 when i downvote this post the downvote gets auto removed and it only happens in this post
creations-chat 2022-04-12 15:25:26 roscale is supposed to be proportional size compared to the roblox avatar but that f4 is nowhere near roscale as the f4 is huge compared to its pilot and 1 wide planes are basically rc plane scale in most cases
creations-chat 2022-04-12 15:41:35 for me roscale is 2 wide planes usually but never 1 wide
creations-chat 2022-05-23 22:40:39 bro that f117 is probably better than anything anyone here can make just stop looking for things to bitch about <:FineTroll:626841259746656289>
creations-chat 2022-06-14 23:01:07 give the poor guy some feedback <:FineTroll:626841259746656289>
creations-chat 2022-06-14 23:03:38 well he said its an f4c which has a stubbier nose but the rest seems reasonable
creations-chat 2022-06-14 23:20:35 this you? 💀
(lol)
creations-chat 2022-06-14 23:23:41 rbk based <:trollface:775024642104229898>
creations-chat 2022-06-14 23:26:08 come back when you get a rank that actually requires skill to get <:trollface:775024642104229898>
you get that for making a build with a certain amount of blocks not because its good
and look at my last creation post i can just get designer 4 when i want to
(lol)
creations-chat 2022-06-14 23:32:18 Tbh the whole downvote upvote systems just encourages people to be toxic and tryhardy a like systems would be way less conflict inducing
creations-chat 2022-06-14 23:35:08 The whole thing goes like this. Someone gets download because his build is slightly sub par then he gets angry and downvotes build that aren't even that bad and the cycle repeats eventually creating a toxic circlejerk of a community, with a like systems you just like it or don't, if you don't you can just ignore it, less ego building and less conflict.
Sorry for my bad autocorrect
creations-chat 2022-06-22 14:44:09 yeah the people who assume all people from a country are the same as what the country does are the biggest type of stupid
creations-chat 2022-06-22 14:46:52 oh myanmar
creations-chat 2022-06-22 14:52:38 honestly still better than being related to china since i get called a ccp spy and shite like that lol

creations-chat 2022-10-17 23:52:56 some advice for real 
never post on pcc if you are a beginner most people here have standards wayyyy to high for beginners and its also a literal circlejerk 90% of the time
creations-chat 2023-04-14 12:42:47 its just some text bruh what you on about
sorry but time spent doesnt make a build good and it would still be trash if it was a verse of the bible or any text for that matter, its simply an unoriginal and low skill build
creations-chat 2023-04-14 12:46:24 make the mecca or something if it looks good then i would upvote it
its not a thing of reigion making text is simply bad
creations-chat 2023-04-14 12:48:30 they made a board atleast <:FineTroll:626841259746656289>
creations-chat 2023-04-14 12:50:57 if it was a bad synagogue it would be the same as that poorly written sentence on the plot floor, make it nicer, add it on the quran or something, making text on the floor is simply just bad
creations-chat 2023-04-14 12:55:00 i do not care if you are a muslim or a jew you posted a poorly made piece of text on the floor and cried islamophobia because people said it was bad you need to stop with the self victimization
do you not remember in hannukah when people posted crappy hannukah candles they also got shit on
creations-chat 2023-04-14 12:57:55 what else did you expect in here lol
creations-chat 2023-04-14 13:01:46 i dont know about the tryhards on the server but i geniunely do not give a fuck about your religion or whether you are a whitename or not i repsect religions but that build was simply bad
