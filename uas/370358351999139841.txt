[TITLE] - Better control surfaces
[CATEGORY] - Configurable

[DESCRIPTION] - (Sorry if I put this in the wrong category) 
For control surfaces, you should have the ability to change what they do. In there menu thing, there should be three boxes labeled Yaw, Pitch, and Roll. These settings should be on by default, but if you turn on off the control surface wont do anything for that axis. For example, the ailerons on airplanes control roll, the elevators control pitch, and the rudder controls yaw. The ability to do this would greatly improve gameplay.
bug-reports 2020-05-19 21:30:26 please fix motor 2, its driving me insane. when i spawn my thing theres a 50/50 chance of the motor just going down at full force instead of following the curser. when theres a max angle it will get stuck when trying to turn around because of the way it works, they shouldnt be trying to go past the max angle, and go the other way instead.
bug-reports 2020-06-05 21:55:19 cant join the game
bug-reports 2020-06-05 21:55:38 not sure if this is actually a bug but i though i should report it just incase
bug-reports 2020-06-05 21:56:07 plane crazy loading screen :/
bug-reports 2020-06-06 15:53:33 It’s working again, you don’t have to worry. It was prob just something wrong on my end
bot-central 2020-06-08 16:13:50 [Continuation of my previous suggestion] I understand this may be difficult because the game is hard coded, so you could just add new blocks to work around it. Also, please put a little yellow thing on the SAS block so we know where to point it, and something else on it so we know if we put it upside down. I know this seems a bit far fetched, but you already have a similar system in place for mouse control with control surfaces, so at least give this a shot, and don't not try because it sounds hard. Thanks for reading this, and if rickje139 sees this, hi! I hope you all have a great day.

Title: Cannon
Category: PVP
Description: Ships and tanks are limited to slow and ugly weapons that don't work. When you make a tank, you'd expect to have a proper gun that works well, but you are limited to things like rockets, which are terribly slow. An easy fix would be a cannon weapon. It would be the same size as a fireworks block, deal a heck ton of damage, and the shots would move very fast, although this would be pretty op. To make it less op so it doesn't completely ruin the game, it should have an extremely slow rate of fire (5-20 seconds in-between each shot) and have actual recoil so only larger and more stable builds can use them, for example, tanks, ships, and not lines with wheels with every pvp weapon strapped to one block on the front. This would make larger builds have an actual use, and make them fun to build and use in pvp. If you have any ideas about how this could be balanced more or a different way it could work, dm me, I'd like to hear about it. And there should also be a way to stager the shots if that make sense. (By holding down the button, instead of them all shooting at the same time then not firing again for a while, one should shoot, then a few seconds later, an other one will shoot, and so on)

[Title] Remove Tracer Shots
[Category] PVP, Gameplay

Tracer shots (the red shots) from guns don't do anything useful. They make the game lag more, they don't deal damage, and only go half the distance of the other shots. It makes no sense why they exist and should be removed or given a use.
