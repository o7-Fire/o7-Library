Yee yee ahh super Sonic Soviet interceptor can't reach 1000+(pvp planes must go to 900+ to be an actual pvp plane)
creations-chat 2022-05-19 13:27:30 Not really if your trying to run away from AA tanks or turrets


(Would still be a massive disadvantage if you accidentally do a 9G turn while moving at 400+ which loses your airspeed)
creations-chat 2022-05-19 13:31:39 He can't reach 500+ which makes a disadvantage also guns still work if you have good aim ig
creations-chat 2022-05-19 13:37:32 If he's flying at a low altitude like 200 or 300+ you could have a small window of time to at least so some holes on him
creations-chat 2022-05-19 14:55:41 Unless the tank user is a pvp tank sweat that can make a tank fly thenbyou better run away
