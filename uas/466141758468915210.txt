creations-chat 2022-02-25 15:47:24 Not always count of blocks but mostly yes
creations-chat 2022-02-25 15:52:07 You can join but when you posted creations you should have been prepared for this
creations-chat 2022-02-25 16:02:42 You have to get skill... they just tell how, next you use that information to get more complex motorlock

help 2022-02-26 22:53:19 Is this battleship or sub?
help 2022-02-26 22:54:04 well, first of all decks on battleships are *flat*
help 2022-02-26 22:54:21 thats why people are asking
help 2022-02-26 22:55:06 Also its kind of dreadnought with casemates right?
help 2022-02-26 22:55:34 yea supersturcture reflects IJN a bit
help 2022-02-26 22:56:31 well if you want something like this
help 2022-02-26 22:56:38 I have to say you better motorlock deck
help 2022-02-26 22:56:54 with halfblocks
help 2022-02-26 22:58:23 you can try using half wedges as slopes near deck
help 2022-02-26 22:59:18 here you use regular wedges for slope, I suggest you use smaller one

creations-chat 2022-06-27 21:16:37 1. up-scale your CV to make more details
2. motorlock flightdeck painting if you want to make at least some sort of rounds on it 
if you want I can show you how unfinished CV can look
creations-chat 2022-06-28 10:35:19 jolly, I will explain my downvote
1. Your carrier for me is wooden deck -> WWII so I want to see not so fat deck (search IJN Akagi, Kaga, Shokaku, Zuikaku or even Hakuryu)
2. Your AA armament can be seen only on one side (unlike real IJN CVs)
3. IJN CVs get a bit more deck painting (Like again Akagi is an example)
creations-chat 2022-06-28 10:37:45 At least make it armoured deck then (Hakuryu)
creations-chat 2022-06-28 10:42:39 So I guess unfinished CV is 1 color and looks boring
creations-chat 2022-06-28 10:46:12 Havent seen naval/or any spaceship game server
creations-chat 2022-07-04 21:26:12 motorlock, just simple motorlock
creations-chat 2022-07-04 21:28:15 You can motorlock each gun into position you want, also they have nice positions, so even not motorlock if size of BB allows
creations-chat 2022-07-04 21:30:58 **build them** 
and motorlock them into those positions, on top you are able to make them smaller/cut amount of secondaries
creations-chat 2022-07-04 21:33:27 Also, how wide and long is that part of superstructure on your ship?
creations-chat 2022-07-04 21:39:23 You can fit those on hull that is 17 blocks wide without a doubt, motor2 beneath each gun will work fine, also functional in what way? just rotating? rotating + elevation for barrels? or even firing?
help 2022-07-07 16:37:50 Why gif called aileron pitchâ€¦
help 2022-07-07 16:55:03 Anyway, what blocks can I use to make fire flash to make it look sort of realistic?
help 2022-07-07 16:57:59 
help 2022-07-07 17:00:35 thanks
help 2022-07-08 06:55:48 fold the superstructure, you got a lot of space for it above your bow (even if you get the stern above your bow)
creations-chat 2022-07-09 11:44:49 which bow is better and how can I improve it rn?
creations-chat 2022-07-09 12:35:57 <@420618093438566410>  before I forgot, motorlock edges of deck so it looks not sharp on the bow, and also frame 30 is frame behind turret A (simply get this shape above waterline if possible next time
Also your superstructure looks compressed a lot (decks amount) 
Anyway, good job on helena
