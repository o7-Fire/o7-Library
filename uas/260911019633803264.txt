creations-chat 2019-07-22 21:51:25 thanks it is meant to be a blackbird
creations-chat 2019-07-22 21:51:51 some more perspectives
creations-chat 2019-07-22 21:52:17 yeah
creations-chat 2019-07-22 21:52:18 my bad
creations-chat 2019-07-22 21:52:22 forgot the name xD
creations-chat 2019-07-22 21:52:32 should've double checked with google
creations-chat 2019-07-22 22:40:41 I do, it's just that I miss remembered if that makes any sense.
creations-chat 2019-07-22 22:41:14 since you are downvoting it, what are your suggestions for me to improve?
creations-chat 2019-07-22 23:20:18 I added the extra 4 tails because it was not turning quick enough which made it less realistic compared to the extremely mobile plane irl.
creations-chat 2019-07-22 23:20:46 But if you think that tradeoff is what ruins the build I guess that is something I live with.
creations-chat 2019-07-22 23:21:55 It was just a stupid mistake, but downvote me because I have sucky memory.
