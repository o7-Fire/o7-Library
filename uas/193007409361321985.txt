bug-reports 2019-03-08 23:39:29 Super Rocket Engines no longer provide sufficient enough lift to a vehicle.
bug-reports 2019-03-08 23:39:59 yeah i stuffed four of them in the bottom of my Mercury-Redstone and it isn't flying
bug-reports 2019-03-08 23:44:45 correction, regular Rocket Engines don't provide enough thrust
bug-reports 2019-03-08 23:44:54 odds are, everything _but_ the SRE is affected under rocket engines
bug-reports 2019-03-08 23:45:13 i'm testing out my submarine which uses a few regulars at the back for surfacing and it isn't providing enough thrust to stay on the water
