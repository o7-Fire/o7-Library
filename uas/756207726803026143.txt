the-dump 2022-06-21 20:38:59 Famous last words
creations-chat 2022-06-22 00:17:32 thx, i think im also expecting that creations doesnt like gaps in the wings lol
creations-chat 2022-06-22 07:24:55 Told ya its cursed
Actually, i might try to smoothen that part out with a 1x4 delta wing now that i think of it
creations-chat 2022-06-22 07:33:23 Looks like an su57 to me, prob wrong tho

creations-chat 2022-06-24 00:54:36 DAMN THATS SICK! Mines uhâ€¦ (this is an old pic btw i increased the cockpit slightly since then lol)
creations-chat 2022-06-24 01:01:52 yes
creations-chat 2022-06-24 02:32:37 yea my building style is kinda weird, also i built this to be a purely pvp build so I tried to make it a smaller tank lol
To lumiisweird: nah lol
creations-chat 2022-06-24 02:35:00 *dies*
creations-chat 2022-06-29 08:08:22 Wat in da hayull
creations-chat 2022-08-10 15:58:06 Well i did take the wings from my b17 lol

Nah i remade the entire fuselage for that bomber, so sort of habit that it ended up like that ig lol
creations-chat 2022-08-10 16:00:52 For reference, my goofy ahh b17
creations-chat 2022-08-10 16:03:36 Well it has the YB designation, meaning prototype bomber, for a reason lol
creations-chat 2022-08-10 19:11:08 Lol its literally just a large rocket engine cuz why not
the-dump 2022-08-21 07:44:46 Goofy ahh carrier
the-dump 2022-08-21 07:44:48 
the-dump 2022-08-21 07:44:55 Lol
the-dump 2022-08-28 08:31:51 Goofy ahh WIP carrier + carrier fighter built in the hangar
the-dump 2022-08-28 08:40:14 Thats the nickname of the fighter design itself lol
the-dump 2022-08-28 08:40:55 The Mk.87 Troll looks like it was dropped by me as a child tho:
the-dump 2022-08-28 08:41:08 
the-dump 2022-08-28 08:41:10 Lol
the-dump 2022-08-28 08:42:05 O yeah thats for a group im in, i just slapped the colors on the tail and called it a day
the-dump 2022-08-28 08:42:39 I prob shouldve just put the colors on the wings or fuselage lol
the-dump 2022-08-28 08:42:54 TCR
the-dump 2022-08-28 08:43:09 Yas
the-dump 2022-08-28 08:43:57 In terms of looks the 2nd is better by far but the 1st takes up less space
the-dump 2022-08-28 08:44:11 So its a bit of a trade off
the-dump 2022-08-28 08:46:14 To me the main visual drawback of the 1st one is the way I designed the folding wings
the-dump 2022-08-28 08:46:54 When I have them opened which is almost always, it just looks kinda weird since the internal section just gets thinner until it reaches the rotating part
the-dump 2022-08-28 08:47:30 Whereas that same area would atleast be covered by the fuselage in something like a tomcat or mig 23
creations-chat 2022-09-01 02:16:15 Nice bf109

creations-chat 2022-09-23 04:56:49 ðŸ’€
creations-chat 2022-09-23 05:28:58 I find it easier that way as it was already in my camera roll ðŸ’€
creations-chat 2022-09-23 05:32:02 I mean i cant just whip out a picture perfect f5 outta thin fucking air lol, and besides its ***been*** reworked several times. It looked so much worse before so im just happy with the fact it has a slight resemblance of one XD
creations-chat 2022-09-23 05:34:56 Eh im still working on the style, just like I said with my f5, the original banner was way worse lol. Im keepin it so ye
creations-chat 2022-09-23 05:40:03 Bruh. Iâ€™m content with the the banner and thumbnails (most of em atleast) that i have cuz its *my* channel. Im improving it when I feel like it lol. Im not tryna go professional atm so its more of a pastime/hobby ig.
creations-chat 2022-09-23 05:42:27 Btw those are wing panels or disconnectors not props i forgor to mention ðŸ’€
creations-chat 2022-09-23 05:44:55 Oh yea my build styles like that so i can do PSMs lol. (Post stall maneuvers)
creations-chat 2022-09-23 05:48:57 Basically the props allow me to turn better along with doing yaw and pitch while at slow or stalling speed.
creations-chat 2022-09-23 05:51:25 y e s
creations-chat 2022-09-23 05:55:04 n o, ill just build an f18 in my style and paint it black so it already looks like it was shredded by a tomcats air to air missile judging by how yall looked at my f5 lol
creations-chat 2022-09-23 05:57:18 In this case the same style as the f5 lol. Also <@792733005177028628> thats why someone said it was a tut? XD
creations-chat 2022-09-23 06:00:23 Yea at this point i should just spare the creations tab my existence lol
creations-chat 2022-09-23 06:03:07 Noted, thamk
creations-chat 2022-09-23 06:08:20 Yea ive been noticing stuff like that, i was just bored so i posted the f5 cuz i knew it burn ppls eyeballs to at least some extent, hence the dislike bomb comment when i posted lol. I can post worse on purpose just to traumatize players with my builds at this point now that i can think of it hehe.
