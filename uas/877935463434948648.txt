creations-chat 2022-02-21 20:03:58 for extra boost

from the side

yes but side boosters, give boost, from the side

dude, i was making a joke, calm the fuck down
creations-chat 2022-02-21 20:06:51 how can you be that incapable of understanding the simplest and dumbest of jokes

like holy crap
creations-chat 2022-02-21 20:09:35 bro, the stuff i was saying was so stupid, even if you didn't like the joke to find it funny, your brain should be more than capable of understanding that saying such stupid stuff was done ironically

<@456226577798135808> it was just meant to be like stupid at 3am bull shi, but i think it would be pretty easy to understand that i wasn't actually trying to make any points
creations-chat 2022-02-21 20:13:47 i guess your right in there being stupid people, but damn you really got this mad over somthing this dumb?
creations-chat 2022-02-21 20:16:08 that genuinely hurt on levels i cannot explain using words
creations-chat 2022-02-21 20:21:38 i never said i was, i was just confused as to how you could possibly have taken what i have said seriously
creations-chat 2022-02-21 20:26:35 btw if someone can give me some feed back on my plane (like actual feed back not just a "hey your plane is bad") thanks

like i genuinely want feed back for things i can improve
creations-chat 2022-02-21 20:32:17 bec they are in the f-8

might have over angled them a bit but im literally working on that as we speak and its already a bit less angled
creations-chat 2022-02-21 20:35:22 well like i said, i just fixed that rn

its no longer as angled

i also slightly decreased the angle of the wings themselves to better mach the plane
creations-chat 2022-02-23 14:43:46 7/10 pretty good, just a bit underdetailed
creations-chat 2022-03-15 18:47:03 Bruh I swear to God I feel bad for all these kids that are like excited about the builds that they made and like post em here only to get like 90 downvotesðŸ˜­ðŸ‘Œ
creations-chat 2022-03-15 20:38:24 damn
