the-dump 2021-10-31 01:23:47 It’s been 24 hours without GPO… I don’t think I’ll live to see UPD 4.5. I’ve been trying to Rokushiki dash to my classes. Stealing Magu’s I find in the cafeteria even when people tell me they’re “just bananas”. I tried to impale my teacher and gripped this kid I saw in the gym for bounty. Soon as he got gripped, I see marines are coming to my location. I don’t know what to do anymore. Skin has been crawling without having my fingers touch my keys and use moves. My index finger is twitching without using my 50 dmg m1’s. I’m starting to hallucinate. Every black person I’ve seen looks like the npcs on Sphinx island. My principal looks like Captain Zhen and I could’ve sworn this girl had her weave built like a kraken. Speaking of krakens, I hear the ocean every time I go into the hallways, and become anxious I might get picked up and flung. I need Roblox back, ASAP. Eventually my ticks of randomly saying “there’s a Suna user on me” will become outbursts. My random sword swing motions will happen with a pencil…. I don’t know how many I may slay. Phoeyu… I need GPO. My life isn’t the same without it.It’s been too long without GPO. It feels like years. I can already feel my mind going numb, by the absence of this game. I cant sleep. I wake up to the noise of the devil fruit notifier yet GPO is not open... My mind is playing tricks on me. I cant go on for much longer. I’ve begin to grind irl. I’ve murdered my family for xp I’ve found several devil fruits in my cupboard. I’m starving for GPO. I cannot hold it in anymore. This world has truly become hell.

the-dump 2021-10-31 01:32:12 This.... This is it... this is the 41st hour of my life without playing Roblox.  I do not know what is real.  I can no longer tell right from wrong.  My moral compass has left me in it's entirety.  I do not know if I need food anymore.  Everything I see, touch, feel, smell, all remind me of Roblox.  I saw a man eating a cheeseburger, and was instantly reminded of the "Cheezburger" gear on Roblox... I saw a man hold someone at knife-point, and all I saw was Murder Mystery 2.  It has gotten so bad to the point where I need to ask the strangers I see if what they are doing really is a "Roblox" reference or not.  The man with the knife I was talking about earlier?  I stopped the robbery mid way through, and asked him "How many chromas do you own?".  He seemed to be incredibly dased, and did not seem to have a single clue as to what I was talking about.  A few seconds passed, and I asked him again, "How many chromas do you own...?".  Again, he hesitated in his answer.  I did not feel like dealing with his rather offensive and silent disposition he had towards me, so I revealed myself as the "sherrif" and shot him 7 times in the chest, and 4 times in the head.  As his wriggling, nearly lifeless corpse fell over, I asked him one more time,  "How many chromas do you own?".  This time he uttered his last words, before being ruthlessly dragged to a painful death: "I own three...".  Finally satisifed with my answer, I nonchalantly walked aware from the murder scene (yet another Murder Mystery 2 reference!).  Fast forward to now, I am in my Jeep (one that has an eerie resemblance to the free model one you can use inside of roblox) and am traveling at 60 studs per second to San Mateo, California.  Whatever David Baszucki can do now won't save him.  I am out only for blood, and no object, no human, no security system is strong enough to stop me from sacrificing him to John Doe to bring back Roblox.  This is it
