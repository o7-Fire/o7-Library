help 2021-02-24 16:11:08 This game is really fun, I like to make cool contraptions and stuff, but I suck at building things like planes. The only immersive sandbox block building game I've played was minecraft, so I am coming in with barely any experience with block building.  Any suggestions on how I can improve on this or how you improved being in my position?
help 2021-02-24 16:13:09 I have, but it doesn't really seem to improve my building skill. I want to be able to create my own original ideas.
help 2021-02-24 16:16:14 Is it something that just comes with own experience?
help 2021-02-24 16:18:06 Is it possible to learn this like maybe from a routine of some sort?
help 2021-02-24 16:18:25 It doesnt have to be primarily from plane crazy
help 2021-02-24 16:18:48 Sort of like aim trainers
help 2021-02-24 16:19:31 Yes, I want to be able to create stuff that come up in my head that dont end up terrible.
