creations-chat 2022-02-18 14:19:35 So the front is just fine, the problem is the rear

creations-chat 2022-02-18 14:25:28 oh fuck, forgot that, I was looking at 1971 photos
creations-chat 2022-02-18 14:27:33 yeah fuck it, imma make another car, any recomendations from cars from the 40's to the 70's?
creations-chat 2022-02-18 14:29:36 Yeah anyways imma just make another car
creations-chat 2022-02-18 14:31:44 bro all of you are saying it's bad, I'm starting to think it's bad aswell, what the fuck do you want me to do?
creations-chat 2022-02-18 14:34:02

creations-chat 2022-02-18 14:38:45 yeah imma make the one that's not a truck... Actually, I think imma make a custom car looking at these 40-60's cars
creations-chat 2022-02-18 14:40:48 Also guys should I lift the car half a block or have them touching the ground along the wheels
creations-chat 2022-02-18 14:43:07 Like a disconnector off ground?
creations-chat 2022-02-18 14:52:31 Alright, thanks for the tip
creations-chat 2022-02-25 03:17:35 This is pretty much a technical build. What do you think this is, guys? A minicopter or a tinycopter
creations-chat 2022-03-03 23:29:58 Yo, everyone. Do you think I should cover this truck's gap with a half block?
creations-chat 2022-03-04 00:07:02 bro at least say yes or no, do I cover the gap
creations-chat 2022-03-04 00:09:41 :/ no lol
creations-chat 2022-03-04 00:13:07 lol ok XD
creations-chat 2022-03-04 00:16:15 alright, thanks for actually giving me tips dude!
creations-chat 2022-03-04 20:00:42 yo guys what do you think about this custom minitank
creations-chat 2022-03-04 20:02:46 Got some refferences from the Goliath Tank used in WW2, which was explosive, just like mine
creations-chat 2022-03-04 20:06:13 
creations-chat 2022-03-04 20:12:48 Any honest opinion from the non-expert members in the server that don't have more ranks in their role list than pins in a boy scout's uniform?
creations-chat 2022-03-04 20:15:17 Alright, thanks for the tips bro! Should I hide the suspension with more disconnectors?
creations-chat 2022-03-04 20:24:42 Changed the colors
creations-chat 2022-03-04 20:27:28 yeah, and it works really good. Can destroy an average-sized ground vehicle and it's really fast for it's size, max speed of 220 SPS
creations-chat 2022-03-04 20:29:31 (excuse my grammar, I'm not an english speaker. I'm from Southamerica actually)
creations-chat 2022-03-04 20:31:36 this is how it looks with disconnectors covering the suspension, I think I should switch to half wedges
creations-chat 2022-03-05 14:27:45 YO IT WORKS ON WATER
creations-chat 2022-03-07 14:55:42 Yo guys, I'm still finishing this little zeppelin. What do you think about how it's looking? Should I fix the fins?
creations-chat 2022-03-07 15:00:51 Same zeppelin with fixed fins
creations-chat 2022-05-21 14:43:47 wait what
what do you mean
creations-chat 2022-05-21 14:45:39 uh
it's just as wide as it's supposed to be
creations-chat 2022-05-21 14:47:20 Hey bro
creations-chat 2022-05-21 14:49:18 no, I'm actually in PVP mode
creations-chat 2022-05-21 14:52:07 uh- thanks I guess
creations-chat 2022-05-21 14:53:53 just compared the tank with a lego version of it
creations-chat 2022-05-21 15:05:36 uh- should I try motor locking the middle section of the tank
creations-chat 2022-06-11 12:27:34 here's my Patriot truck again but I updated the back
creations-chat 2022-06-11 12:29:49 even better.
Added some signs at the very back, now the exposed motors in there are harder to see from the side (I also painted the windows)
creations-chat 2022-06-11 12:46:38 yup
creations-chat 2022-10-16 12:55:46 Finally did it
creations-chat 2022-10-16 13:02:49 Yeah bruh-
I don't even know what's wrong with the jet
creations-chat 2022-10-16 13:06:04 Yeah I know, it's supposed to be in the horizontal wing itself but I can't do that
creations-chat 2022-10-16 13:09:01 Bro, check the motorlock of this
creations-chat 2022-10-16 13:11:05 B r o
I did what they told me to do, which was hide the motors in the wings
and now you still say it's poorly made
creations-chat 2022-10-16 13:16:59 Okay dude I get it-
creations-chat 2022-12-14 15:15:58 What else should I add to this plane?
Don't tell me there's exposed motorlock, I know there is, I'm not blind
creations-chat 2022-12-14 15:34:53 Yours is a biplane
mine is a monoplane
creations-chat 2022-12-14 16:01:42 Man it's my first plane
the first plane I built
creations-chat 2022-12-14 16:04:43 uh no, I was saying it was the first plane I built
I've been improving it over the months
creations-chat 2022-12-14 16:06:59 bro it's the first plane I built since I joined the game
creations-chat 2022-12-18 23:20:53 Remaking my MK IV Tank, but it's a bit smaller
creations-chat 2022-12-18 23:49:14 I don't think it's looking off
so far it's looking really good for me
really accurate
creations-chat 2022-12-18 23:56:18 Have you seen that scene from All Quiet on The Western Front
when the tanks are raiding the frontline of Soissons
that's what happens
creations-chat 2022-12-19 12:43:37 Finished the MK IV Tank
creations-chat 2022-12-19 12:45:45 if I added 2 guns instead it would be much weaker in PVP
thanks bro
creations-chat 2022-12-19 12:53:38 ...
Should I post it in <#384025409945337856> ..?
creations-chat 2022-12-19 13:00:44 BRO
WHEN I MADE IT BIGGER YOU SAID IT HAD TOO MUCH WIDTH
BECAUSE IT WAS 3 BLOCKS WIDE, AND ALSO
WHAT DETAILS IS IT MISSING
creations-chat 2022-12-19 13:03:27 What details is it missing bruh, there isn't more to add
creations-chat 2022-12-19 13:06:01 I don't think there's a problem with it being too small-
I just wanted to make it roscale-ish
creations-chat 2022-12-19 13:08:07 okay, imma attempt to add the top part of the MG port
creations-chat 2022-12-19 13:12:55 there
creations-chat 2022-12-19 13:16:23 Much better, right?
creations-chat 2022-12-19 13:18:26 My bro you think I can add a motorlock tower to this?
creations-chat 2022-12-19 13:23:24 **Flashbacks**
creations-chat 2022-12-19 15:28:32 If I fix the casemates, then the gun won't be able to rotate
I'll try to fix the tracks
creations-chat 2022-12-19 17:28:29 Alright, I fixed the side MGs
creations-chat 2022-12-19 17:43:19 Fixed it
creations-chat 2022-12-19 17:59:35 Guys, any ideas on what else should I add to this tank before posting it again in <#384025409945337856> ?
creations-chat 2022-12-20 19:33:25 A Fokker Dr. 1 I made, almost no exposed motorlock
creations-chat 2022-12-20 19:41:51 Thanks bro
creations-chat 2022-12-20 19:43:55 Fixed the vertical fin
creations-chat 2022-12-20 22:34:12 I don't think they downvote my Fokker just because it doesn't have any decals
creations-chat 2022-12-20 22:42:51 BRO WHY DID SOMEONE DOWNVOTE ME
What's so bad about my Fokker..
creations-chat 2022-12-20 23:01:13 Bro it's not a 1x4 wedge..
And hi Cobra
creations-chat 2022-12-20 23:03:16 So I guess you're saying the tail is too flat
creations-chat 2022-12-20 23:05:22 The wings are short bro
creations-chat 2022-12-20 23:43:49 I think I can't improve the tail
creations-chat 2022-12-21 18:48:46 Yeah I don't know how to fix this Fokker's tails
can someone give me a tip
creations-chat 2022-12-21 20:40:47 I THINK I FINALLY FIXED IT
creations-chat 2022-12-21 23:23:22 You guys think this is wide and long enough for MK IV's treads?
creations-chat 2023-06-27 22:47:14 Goofy ahh biplane
thoughts on it?
I made it cartoonish on purpose
creations-chat 2023-06-27 23:49:57 Keeping the tail like that is what makes it look goofy
creations-chat 2023-06-28 00:40:21 yippie👍
