plane-crazy 2019-08-17 02:06:42 if you could help me out I would appreciate it a lot
plane-crazy 2019-08-17 02:06:11 however after a while it does this and stays like this
plane-crazy 2019-08-17 02:05:27 normally it's supposed to be like this
plane-crazy 2019-08-17 02:05:12 hello I require help with my amphibious car.
plane-crazy 2019-08-17 01:03:29 by any chance do pontoons float better than regular blocks?
plane-crazy 2019-08-17 01:00:28 how the heck do you break motors like that
plane-crazy 2019-08-17 00:59:01 thank you very much
plane-crazy 2019-08-17 00:58:24 where do I suggest things?
plane-crazy 2019-08-16 20:55:47 wait where is the smoke emitter
plane-crazy 2019-08-16 20:55:23 amphibious car
plane-crazy 2019-08-16 18:26:01 I'm going both backwards and straight up at the same time
plane-crazy 2019-08-16 18:23:55 you might want to use downwards facing engines for that
plane-crazy 2019-08-16 18:23:29 but I saw the sign near the dock
plane-crazy 2019-08-16 18:23:23 in that little cave that was used in the winter event
plane-crazy 2019-08-16 18:23:07 I thought it would be there too
plane-crazy 2019-08-16 18:22:58 or are pontoons just small boats
plane-crazy 2019-08-16 18:22:46 boats are just giant pontoons
plane-crazy 2019-08-16 18:22:19 basically a better pool noodle
plane-crazy 2019-08-16 18:22:09 it's a floaty thingy
plane-crazy 2019-08-16 18:22:00 maybe. I can't find the rear pontoon either.
plane-crazy 2019-08-16 18:21:42 ^

plane-crazy 2019-06-26 04:40:07 stonks
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 04:36:56 but Copland is an unused OS by apple?
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 04:36:31 ok so
the Espada 128B came from the factory with an OS called Copland
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 04:34:50 so 180 should be good
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 04:34:44 most places sell for ~90 each
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 04:33:00 mr. worldwide over here
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 04:32:52 German, has Spanish name, only known model to exist as far as I know is in America.
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 04:31:23 also the Espada 128B is German?
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 04:30:56 *you think*

plane-crazy 2019-06-26 04:30:06 magnets can seriously mess up computers though
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 04:29:30 the entire left side

plane-crazy 2019-06-26 04:27:28 or anything
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 04:27:21 I don't see a manufacturer name on it
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 04:27:11 I don't know.
