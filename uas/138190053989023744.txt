help 2019-02-18 03:46:31 Howdy
help 2019-02-18 03:47:15 Ive found a big bug in plane crazy that brings me to tears
help 2019-02-18 03:47:34 over 12 hours of work just dissapeared from 3 save spots in my save area
help 2019-02-18 03:47:59 okay
bug-reports 2019-02-18 03:48:24 can someone please help me recover my 12 hours of work that dissapeared from 3 save spots?
bug-reports 2019-02-18 03:48:48 they have all been rolled back to since I had rebuilt a giant quadcopter Ive been putting a lot of hard work into
bug-reports 2019-02-18 03:49:19 I was hoping to finish what I got working, and its all not there
bug-reports 2019-02-18 03:49:34 this bug brings me to tears
bug-reports 2019-02-18 03:50:26 I was saving after a whole slew of steps in three saves many times
bug-reports 2019-02-18 03:53:54 well,  I had gone and built farther and saved like mad what seems to have rolled back in the hours that I was sleeping today
bug-reports 2019-02-18 03:54:33 I had a working giant quadcopter last night, and all 3 of my saves were crawled back to before I had even worked on the motors
bug-reports 2019-02-18 03:56:08 my Save  data used says 260.654 and max save data 260.000
bug-reports 2019-02-18 03:56:55 this is my first attempt at building something big
bug-reports 2019-02-18 03:57:04 probably my only big attempt aswell
bug-reports 2019-02-18 03:57:34 my 3 saves acumulated to over 1900 parts, and there at 1433
bug-reports 2019-02-18 04:03:17 I'm sorry if what I am saying doesn't make sense
bug-reports 2019-02-18 04:08:10 Lots of people saw me working on it and flying it
bug-reports 2019-02-18 04:08:39 and I didn't take any pictures when I had it flying, was too tired, and had to sleep
bug-reports 2019-02-18 04:11:27 I can clarify that what I see in my 3 save spots is indeed my rebuilt chassis, though the majority of what I accomplished is gone
bug-reports 2019-02-18 04:14:24 all my work on rebuilding 2 rear motor housings in better placement is not there
bug-reports 2019-02-18 04:24:33 is it common for this game to corrupt players save data?
creations-chat 2019-02-18 04:35:04 has anyone here had a saved work rolled back on them?
creations-chat 2019-02-18 04:36:44 dang, this bug only happened to me
creations-chat 2019-02-18 04:37:22 what I saved this morning in game in 3 different slots is gone
bug-reports 2019-02-18 04:47:55 I spoke about that a while ago
bug-reports 2019-02-18 04:48:06 the save data
bug-reports 2019-02-18 04:48:23 less than a floppy disk's capacity
bug-reports 2019-02-18 04:49:23 is saving a project 3 times not allowed?
bug-reports 2019-02-18 04:49:41 within the save slots alotted
bug-reports 2019-02-18 04:50:58 _facepalms_
bug-reports 2019-02-18 04:51:15 _face plants keyboard_
bug-reports 2019-02-18 04:51:41 what is the limit, 260 bytes?
bug-reports 2019-02-18 04:53:36 how the heck are people building far bigger builds than me  suceeding?!?
bug-reports 2019-02-18 04:54:15 even though it asys save successfull its not really saving?
bug-reports 2019-02-18 04:54:41 the heck kind of game is this
bug-reports 2019-02-18 04:56:11 and we are restricted to saving space far lower than the first IBM 5150 desktop computers RAM (640Kbytes) in the early 1980s
bug-reports 2019-02-18 05:02:01 well my build wasn't that big, and it had a lot of empty space
bug-reports 2019-02-18 05:02:07 inside
bug-reports 2019-02-18 05:02:40 so your saying my save file on the server from this morning doesn't exist?
bug-reports 2019-02-18 05:03:21 I'm just trying to understand  this
bug-reports 2019-02-18 05:04:52 what I saved this morning, it told me it was sucessfully saved, will still say that even if the build is over the limit and wont actually save?
bug-reports 2019-02-18 05:05:22 then those people who build boats far bigger than what Ive built are geniuses
bug-reports 2019-02-18 05:06:27 I'm already sorry I tried to build something I visuallized in a game that doesn't give players a realistic allotment
bug-reports 2019-02-18 05:08:30 260kbytes is all they can physically give per player?
bug-reports 2019-02-18 05:09:04 not even kilo?
bug-reports 2019-02-18 05:10:33 oh dont insult me like that
bug-reports 2019-02-18 05:11:57 I'm going off of what you said "actually 260 kilobytes then
and the save limit isn't using bytes as the unit of measurement"
bug-reports 2019-02-18 05:13:21 why do they call it that then >.<
bug-reports 2019-02-18 05:13:48 the one who use that word next to those numbers in the save gui
bug-reports 2019-02-18 05:14:51 I'm sorry, I thought they used bytes, having gone back in and check I was wrong
bug-reports 2019-02-18 05:15:28 they dont even give us an option to delete an old build
bug-reports 2019-02-18 05:20:41 I think its a bit deceptive for them to give 15 save slots instead of 8
bug-reports 2019-02-18 05:22:19 thats very indirect, though I am doing that
bug-reports 2019-02-18 05:23:34 my mistake was saving the thing 3 times
bug-reports 2019-02-18 05:23:48 trying to keep myself from doing what I did the night before
bug-reports 2019-02-18 05:24:18 having backups of ones own build on the system is no good ðŸ˜¦
bug-reports 2019-02-18 05:26:41 woa, I just tested saving 1 block in each save space, it consumes a lot more
bug-reports 2019-02-18 05:27:00 than what I anticipated
bug-reports 2019-02-18 05:28:47 iirc this must be my second time learning this since november, I will be more careful this time
bug-reports 2019-02-18 05:33:10 I find myself going into the mysery of trying to rebuild the thing again, the right way thist time, not as a psychotic saver ðŸ˜„
help 2019-02-18 06:46:16 anyone know the trick to aligning inner wedges?
help 2019-02-18 06:46:20 its a pain to find it
creations-chat 2019-02-18 11:39:38 can I submit a picture?
creations-chat 2019-02-18 11:50:01 This truck I built back in November, its inspired from the real world "Shockwave" jet racing truck
creations-chat 2019-02-18 12:36:50 Heres a drone I made a couple months back before building the big one
creations-chat 2019-02-18 13:05:01 dang an update
creations-chat 2019-02-18 13:38:02 Oh yea heres my small one designed to fit in vehicles xD
