creations-chat 2022-12-02 17:46:45 Oh ok ty for the tip
creations-chat 2023-02-23 18:26:06 Long time since I played but this was my mother ship with full interior and its fleet I called "Contour"
creations-chat 2023-02-23 18:28:50 It's alright, I want to make another one when plane crazy 2 comes out because it's not that good when it comes to the small details. Like people have such insane motor locking and mine just isn't that impressive anymore
creations-chat 2023-02-23 23:16:09 I love the concept, the front of the ship is very futuristic and the hue is nice!
For a first ship this is impressive and you should keep up at it
