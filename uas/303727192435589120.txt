bug-reports 2019-06-12 06:40:35 parachutes fly if you put more than 30 on a creation
creations-chat 2019-06-12 23:52:01 i want to make a kaiju, but how would i :?
creations-chat 2019-06-12 23:54:18 oh no im building it right now
creations-chat 2019-06-12 23:54:26 im thinking on how to do these legs
creations-chat 2019-06-13 00:24:13 this isnt working
creations-chat 2019-06-13 00:26:18 or an aquatic kaiju is even better and easier to build
creations-chat 2019-06-13 01:05:11 tail? easy i make tails that move by them selves on all my animals
creations-chat 2019-06-13 01:05:20 going under water might be trouble though
creations-chat 2019-06-13 02:03:51 This "Kaiju" brings me down to about 10 fps but it has the most blocks of any of my creations

creations-chat 2019-06-14 21:08:03 i made my kaiju
creations-chat 2019-06-14 22:55:54 it actually walks and stuff
creations-chat 2019-06-15 02:53:55 well my kaiju can walk more than 8 feet without falling i just need to understand this thing has no thruster stabilizers like my other walkers, i keep spamming U expecting it to balance me
creations-chat 2019-06-15 03:23:38 goal: hydra
creations-chat 2019-06-15 05:56:01 
creations-chat 2019-06-15 05:56:16 its so easy to fly
creations-chat 2019-06-15 05:56:46 you kinda just mix pressing Q, E, R, W, and there you fly!
creations-chat 2019-06-15 07:48:24 both my kaijus have 433 blocks
creations-chat 2019-06-15 07:48:38 my next one with hopfully have over 1000

creations-chat 2020-08-02 01:03:42 SHIPWRIGHT [IV]
https://gyazo.com/b7500ed3c38586faa64ca9f5758fe642 Block count 
https://gyazo.com/3bc6c10522d31e7e2358bcc4d6ba67ed Turns at a zooming 1 sps
https://gyazo.com/cc9c5fa878fbd08d86dbf20a5fa91a4a Actual speed

Helium count: 3 blocks, all in the ladder so it doesn't get in the way of the ship. 
Is that all?
creations-chat 2020-08-02 01:03:57 I was asking if that's right
bot-central 2020-09-24 21:42:41 I'm not going to suggest anything but if someone wants to pass my message..

Add a more redwood like area, somewhere to test the mobility of your planes
creations-chat 2021-11-17 12:26:00 I noticed the glitching. But to be fair having a mech that uses something similar to hydraulics to move the mech is a bit more interesting
creations-chat 2021-11-17 12:30:11 That's not exactly what I meant by piston powered. It's hard to see in the  screenshot but the pistons are in L shapes and are meant to replace the motors without using 17 million weird building techniques and what I consider glitches
creations-chat 2021-11-17 12:32:25 <:)
creations-chat 2021-11-17 12:37:21 I am like 7 years behind when it comes to building advanced stuff like that. I sorta just do my thing so when I see people with whatever is even going on in that gif I just start wondering what happened to this game
