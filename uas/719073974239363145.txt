creations-chat 2023-05-03 14:06:40 id love to make the interior a lot better but i literally dont have the space to do so
creations-chat 2023-05-03 14:17:59 blame?

creations-chat 2023-05-03 17:19:55 welcome to the plane crazy community (oh dont worry about that. thats an average response here.)
creations-chat 2023-05-03 17:24:44 anyways it says to contact staff if someone is toxic so <@335599526414909451> does that response qualify?
creations-chat 2023-05-03 18:20:06 u play scrap mechanic?
nice
creations-chat 2023-05-04 00:08:57 yea these guys expect u to be a hall of fame level player
creations-chat 2023-05-04 01:10:24 when did i complain? i already said it doesnt matter to me
creations-chat 2023-05-04 01:12:32 i never blamed or complained
all i did was tell my friend what i thought of the situation
it wasnt directed at anyone else
and i dont care about HOF at this point
creations-chat 2023-05-04 01:14:45 i havent seen any equally big an225s at least with the proper proportions
theyve always been either a bit smaller or didnt have thick wings
and there arent many an225s in the first place
so i made this last year
creations-chat 2023-05-04 01:16:48 damn yall are rly toxic
u know this level could affect someone right?
creations-chat 2023-05-04 01:18:52 further proving my point
much appreciated
fyi till now u havent told me a single piece of feedback on the plane
creations-chat 2023-05-04 01:21:16 and thats what i was explaining to jake in the first place
<@835005635359801406> how is mid interior supposed to point out whats wrong LOL
anyways imma watch oshi no ko
creations-chat 2023-05-04 02:10:41 why are you like this?
this "feedback" isnt helpful at all
if ur gonna be toxic at least tell me whats wrong with my plane
creations-chat 2023-05-04 02:36:14 ive been playing the game for like 5 years now and my best piece of advice is build at ur own pace
build something that satisfies u and not the community
ur gonna be the one using ur build the most
the community is only gonna see it once or twice
and at this point they will be toxic rather than give proper feedback
at the end of the day this is a sandbox game, its made for building what YOU want to build and how YOU wanna build it
creations-chat 2023-05-04 02:39:28 im asking HOW does the interior need to be fixed or WHAT i should change
not should it be fixed or not
and u needed someone else to point it out for u
creations-chat 2023-05-04 02:42:06 i said that to jake to explain to him why im getting so many downvotes
i never even spoke to u
and plus u havent given proper feedback and have just been continuously toxic to me this whole time for no reason
proving my point of the community being shit
creations-chat 2023-05-04 02:44:16 i can take downvotes and ur the one not able to take whitenames
uve already lost this argument
ive said multiple times that i was explaining to jake why i got so many downvotes meaning u have no business in it
creations-chat 2023-05-04 02:46:17 i dont care about the ones ignoring ur feedback here
im directly asking u for the reason u dont like my build and what specifically i should change
if u "dont wanna waste braincells" arent u just the same as the ones ignoring ur feedback?
creations-chat 2023-05-04 02:48:19 theres some progress, specify what to change.
lets start with the nose
creations-chat 2023-05-04 02:51:38 oh damn i actually missed that
ill see what i can do when i come back from school
thx for the feedback (finally)
creations-chat 2023-05-04 02:54:00 well dont assume that everyone is the same as those braindeads since that makes u no better than them
got harassed for 2 days straight asking for feedback
creations-chat 2023-05-04 03:00:29 problem with builds that barely fit in the plot is theres almost no room left and i cant add the needed rotation locks to fix a visual issue and that just TANKS the vote
creations-chat 2023-05-04 07:54:16 how about i ignore u instead <:KEKW:670310537300672528>
