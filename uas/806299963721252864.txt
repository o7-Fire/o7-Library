help 2023-01-12 04:49:11 Hey so im making a biplane and my planes usually have a fuselage 1 block wide but thats the width the whole way down. Im usually good with the tail tapering up but tapering inwards is my problem. Can i get some advice on what i can to like angle lock techniques and such?
help 2023-01-12 04:51:58 I am very passionate about making biplanes but it‚Äôs either 1 block width or its oversized so i would really like some help here

creations-chat 2023-01-13 00:23:40 Any suggestions on what i can do to improve this plane? Please respond in <#478584971670454284> and @ me
help 2023-01-13 00:26:12 Oh hey that looks great
help 2023-01-13 00:26:27 If u don‚Äôt remember i asked what it was yesterday
help 2023-01-13 00:26:34 It‚Äôs really starting to shape up
help 2023-01-13 00:27:49 Anyways so i have this biplane and i was wondering if you guys have any criticisms for me on what i can improve
help 2023-01-13 00:28:30 Like actually ‚ÄúOh you can do ____ to improve the look‚Äù not ‚ÄúMotorlock‚Äù or ‚ÄúGet good‚Äù for 5 seconds those aren‚Äôt criticisms those are stupid responses
help 2023-01-13 00:28:34 Also what?
help 2023-01-13 00:30:40 Whyd you say P-51
help 2023-01-13 00:32:04 This is a P-51
help 2023-01-13 00:32:18 This is what i made
help 2023-01-13 00:33:39 Also ill try i have been trying to maybe lock a 1x3 wing panel into that gap but its really hard its all pre occupied space but I‚Äôll figure out something
help 2023-01-13 00:33:49 You are naming all ww2 planes
help 2023-01-13 00:36:09 I cant do that *however* i have been thinking of connecting the wing supports with cameras or trails to reduce the motors on the wings
help 2023-01-13 00:36:37 Because if i connect the inner supports to the outer ones there only needs to be 2 instead of 4 motors
help 2023-01-13 00:39:00 Maybe add some antennae and grebiling (idk how to spell that) and i also suggest maybe a dome like area for plants and such
help 2023-01-13 00:39:16 And maybe the occasional ridge like half blocks
help 2023-01-13 00:40:39 Wdym?
help 2023-01-13 00:41:18 What about it
help 2023-01-13 00:42:11 Ive tried that no space
help 2023-01-13 00:42:34 Oh alr
help 2023-01-13 00:43:40 It *technically is* possible however it would require a MASSIVE rework if not restarting
help 2023-01-13 00:54:48 From what I‚Äôve heard I believe so
help 2023-01-13 00:55:21 So i took your advice and i improved my plane
help 2023-01-13 00:55:25 
help 2023-01-13 00:55:41 1 less motor on the wings and i fixed the gap
help 2023-01-13 00:56:33 Thanks for actually helping
help 2023-01-13 01:09:07 Try having the control surfaces further up
help 2023-01-13 01:09:21 By up i mean forward
help 2023-01-13 01:30:48 What are you making
creations-chat 2023-01-13 02:28:54 Well that was easy
creations-chat 2023-01-13 02:39:09 That looks nothing like what you modeled it after
creations-chat 2023-01-13 02:41:44 Well at least it looks like a C-ram at **all**
creations-chat 2023-01-13 02:46:18 It may be even width but it swivels at a center point
creations-chat 2023-01-13 02:48:22 It dont look advanced one bit
creations-chat 2023-01-13 05:39:53 <@740718867344654436> do you have Guncannon
creations-chat 2023-01-13 05:42:18 Oh alr thats cool also I think you can in creatons chat. Also do they walk and stuff?
creations-chat 2023-01-13 05:45:34 What device? MacOS is Shift+Ctrl+5 idk any others
creations-chat 2023-01-13 20:25:35 It‚Äôs oversized tbh
creations-chat 2023-01-13 20:46:42 Is this about that turret again
creations-chat 2023-01-13 20:48:53 Oh did he delete it?
creations-chat 2023-01-13 20:51:01 Also what do you think of my ocean liner and any constructive feedback? Im all ears
creations-chat 2023-01-13 23:06:16 Either you are on a godly level of building and we should warship you or its in Blendr

the-dump 2023-01-14 05:45:23 
help 2023-01-15 07:17:42 So all the people who make really good looking planes where do you start with a project like this?
help 2023-01-15 07:18:36 Ive been thinking of making a SBD with angle lock and such but for the people who are experienced with propeller planes like this, where do i start?
help 2023-01-15 07:19:02 Its a really magnificent plane and i want to capture it‚Äôs beautiful presence in game
help 2023-01-15 07:25:24 Alr
help 2023-01-15 22:19:13 Normally with builds like zeppelins and things like that i use helium and i put less and less until it float‚Äôs almost perfectly if it rises add ballast blocks to weigh it down and go up .5 but for the long run I suggest only using it in private servers until you get robux for gravity slider. I noticed with updates helium tends to have more of an effect. Some of my old zeppelin builds just go up more than they did before due to physics updates for roblox and such
help 2023-01-15 22:21:12 TLTR: Helium is good but with physics update it kinda screws up so I suggest getting the grav sider asap
help 2023-01-15 22:22:41 Always check your key binds on older builds if you are unsure but if its a new bug then idk try rejoining or making sure your in pvp
help 2023-01-15 22:26:22 It sometimes does that I think they‚Äôre getting an overhaul in pc2 but I think you have to leave it for 10-20 minutes if your typing numbers and if it tags when first spawn it in when you join a server just correct it with whatever is on the other sign that didn‚Äôt tag
creations-chat 2023-01-15 22:29:10 <@707777796843372554> nice jet its a bit unorthodox but its pretty cool
creations-chat 2023-01-15 22:31:52 <@858954391351984141> what would the GTO look like stock
help 2023-01-16 03:28:25 Id suggest leaving it there but I guess you could lock a half block there idk if youll need piston lock to fix the gap
help 2023-01-16 03:29:29 Also what jet is that
help 2023-01-16 04:43:19 Nice
help 2023-01-16 20:00:08 I suggest looking it up I honestly don‚Äôt know
help 2023-01-17 06:18:59 Wing panels are key though I don‚Äôt know where you would put them
help 2023-01-17 06:20:45 I would put them in the back try locking s bunch in one area flat facing
creations-chat 2023-01-17 06:27:01 <@596722744079417345> that camo in your jet is superb my guy üëå

creations-chat 2023-01-17 20:00:41 Its a good build tho
help 2023-01-17 21:44:55 Wdym center landing gear
help 2023-01-17 21:45:43 Oh
help 2023-01-17 21:45:59 Try locking the gears out and back a bit
help 2023-01-17 21:46:34 From what i see the 2 main gears are a bit in front or behind it
help 2023-01-17 21:47:02 Oh the plane is facing right
help 2023-01-17 21:47:33 The middle gear is further back than the other 2
help 2023-01-17 21:48:07 Also maybe lock the other to gears further to the sides by a half block or so
help 2023-01-17 21:48:49 What plane is that maybe i can grab some schematics to better interpret this
help 2023-01-17 21:49:03 Alr
help 2023-01-17 21:52:10 I cant find any pics of it with the gear represented in its  retracted state
help 2023-01-17 21:54:26 Maybe make your 2 main gears shorter if possible
help 2023-01-17 21:54:57 Try doing that
help 2023-01-17 21:55:19 Ok
bug-reports 2023-01-18 04:50:18 Its all **corner wedge**
creations-chat 2023-01-18 05:52:30 <@1004207882784489472> im not s big fan of electric or diesel trains but that is awesome
creations-chat 2023-01-18 05:56:48 Yeah i dont understand why people dislike a absolutely fabulous build that‚Äôs extremely accurate but its not something *they* like despite it being spot on and deserving of an award so they downvote
creations-chat 2023-01-18 05:59:12 Like look at this, its a fantastic build they put effort into and that person probably doesn‚Äôt like that specific car. I dont like F1 cars all to much but i dont have to shit on it
creations-chat 2023-01-18 06:01:56 High standards is an understatement! Every build has at least *one* downvote and its always him. I‚Äôve never seen him upvote a creation that didn‚Äôt take 8 months and the plot is full of motor lock
creations-chat 2023-01-18 06:04:45 A **CITROEN**
creations-chat 2023-01-18 06:09:44 I feel the cockpit is kinda hard to differentiate from the rest, maybe go with black glass or a different shade of dark blue. Other than that i dont see anything wrong with the build
creations-chat 2023-01-18 06:13:04 <@1002450692969070633> idk if u saw this also nice
creations-chat 2023-01-18 06:15:05 I feel like a canopy frame is a bit unrealistic and conveyors could be a side effect of not wanting to use .9 block because it leave kind if a gap but it would be a viable option
creations-chat 2023-01-18 06:18:17 I like the intake detail also <@297120728342331392> the frame would be incredibly hard because round surface and it would be hard to do because complicated piston lock would have to take place to get whatever mystical 1x1 cylinder wing panel into place
creations-chat 2023-01-18 06:20:18 The smoke pipes would complicate things depending on the technique used for the cockpit the smoke pipes lack if connection points on the top would make it hard
creations-chat 2023-01-18 06:22:32 The placement of where the frame would need to be could end up needing the bottom of the smoke pipe could be on the opposite side of where the attachment point is
creations-chat 2023-01-18 06:25:20 Also everything about that tomcat is just üëå

creations-chat 2023-01-18 06:44:49 I meant how *THEY* made it depending on how i the cylinders are connected the smoke pipes could complicate things
creations-chat 2023-01-18 06:47:20 Lets chalk it up to that or history
creations-chat 2023-01-18 06:49:52 I didn‚Äôt say it was impossible I said it would most likely require a redesign because not everyone builds the same
creations-chat 2023-01-18 06:55:21 I may try that tbh
creations-chat 2023-01-18 06:57:34 I probably won‚Äôt make anything that needs a cockpit like this aside from a P-51 but ill try
creations-chat 2023-01-18 07:16:47 Have you seen the builds above that post

creations-chat 2023-01-19 01:03:28 <@578395515033616394> i have some suggestions for your plane
creations-chat 2023-01-19 01:06:35 I made a Cessna and I managed to make the fuselage 2 blocks wide with 2 motors locking the halves, you can also lock down the roof by a half block to make the windshield‚Äôs angle more consistent <@578395515033616394>
creations-chat 2023-01-19 01:08:38 Yes
creations-chat 2023-01-19 01:10:41 Also I suggest making the wheels smaller the front being 1x1 and the rear the small landing gear or simply a trail with a sign and ‚ö´Ô∏è on each side
creations-chat 2023-01-19 01:19:35 For its size i feel like it would be better with 1x1 because of proportions and such, the wheels are paired with the mods I suggested are too big
creations-chat 2023-01-19 01:30:20 Woops I accidentally skipped over that sorry I suggest when you paint depending on the camo lock different shapes for that less blocky look and i think it looks good
help 2023-01-19 02:00:02 <@578395515033616394> can you help me im making a taildragger plane but idk how to do cam lock like you can

creations-chat 2023-02-09 02:12:59 I actually opted for the less smooth for that plane crazy feel + the angles I need don‚Äôt exist so I went for the whole look
creations-chat 2023-02-09 02:15:06 This was a simple build I didn‚Äôt want to over complicate this compact build and I like to keep my builds more down to earth with more basic techniques and features

the-dump 2023-02-09 17:14:58 I mean with phones and laptops you have calculators, games, and so on, once you‚Äôve got a book it kinda just sits there and makes you look 19th century British

the-dump 2023-02-23 20:06:11 But if it has godly amounts of comedy you need that one to harness it all
the-dump 2023-02-23 20:07:23 Speaking of a shit ton of something in a game i play for some unholy reason i decided to stick a V12 engine into one of these bad boys
the-dump 2023-02-23 20:07:41 It now goes 938mph if I *really* tried hard enough
the-dump 2023-02-23 20:09:20 Could‚Äôve used a super car

the-dump 2023-02-23 21:14:02 Potentially with this engine
the-dump 2023-02-23 21:14:52 I can‚Äôt exactly get it to that speed and be effective in a race because if it can get to that top speed the gear ratios have to accelerate super slow
