creations-chat 2022-10-30 22:09:27 Or the Great Hall of the People (the entrence, or else its way too big), but if you wanna make scenery, a fjord would be a good option for a starter

creations-chat 2022-11-02 19:27:33 bismarck didnt have a Bulbous bow
creations-chat 2022-11-02 19:30:47 but the bow bends too much
creations-chat 2022-11-02 19:33:19 no? the bow clearly isnt entirely straight
creations-chat 2022-11-02 19:39:33 During the time of bismarck a bulbous bow didnt have the bulbous, it just had the bended bow which bismarck clearly didnt have, but yours have
creations-chat 2022-11-02 19:42:07 The top
creations-chat 2022-11-02 19:47:25 Forget about the bulbous bow i was a little wrong there but the bow is still bends too much, bismarcks bow was more like a long wedge that bended a little at the top, but yours only bends at the top which is unrealistic
