creations-chat 2019-06-15 16:04:34 <@!340895447616978954> it's difficult to balance the functionality of a flying boat and also the looks of the E8N
creations-chat 2019-06-15 16:04:47 but yeah i'm not great at aesthetics
creations-chat 2019-06-15 22:28:55 haha epic
creations-chat 2019-06-15 22:29:00 just posted my catalina
creations-chat 2019-06-15 22:29:01 big uwu
creations-chat 2019-06-15 22:29:45 I'm aware it doesnt have the guns
creations-chat 2019-06-15 22:29:47 it has the general shape
creations-chat 2019-06-15 22:29:59 similar features too
creations-chat 2019-06-15 22:30:01 same engine placement
creations-chat 2019-06-15 22:30:03 same floats
creations-chat 2019-06-15 22:30:26 you can't do the landing gear on a Catalina because they fold inwards rather than upwards like most aircraft
creations-chat 2019-06-15 22:30:41 lol
creations-chat 2019-06-15 22:30:47 i know the wheel placement is wrong
creations-chat 2019-06-15 22:30:57 I'd like to see you get a landing gear to diagonally fold into the hull and still look nice
creations-chat 2019-06-15 22:31:12 thank u
creations-chat 2019-06-15 22:31:33 you can complain about the landing gear when you can make the mechanism itself >:V
creations-chat 2019-06-15 22:31:55 yeah that's what my aircraft does it's not special
creations-chat 2019-06-15 22:32:14 thank u
creations-chat 2019-06-15 22:32:24 i wanted to go more for functionality than looks
creations-chat 2019-06-15 22:32:39 so it could actually float on water, land on the ground, and look decent
creations-chat 2019-06-15 22:32:52 hence why it's a tilt-rotor
creations-chat 2019-06-16 11:35:30 Kyushu J7W Shinden. Had to add rudder as it could not be attached to the wings, and Tilt-engines to the front as it needed the lift.
creations-chat 2019-06-16 11:35:43 
creations-chat 2019-06-16 12:09:00 <:PewPew:532303441293344778>
creations-chat 2019-06-16 12:09:14 i dont think it's fair to say it "doesnt look anything like a J7W" :/
creations-chat 2019-06-16 12:09:37 the game doesnt exactly allow for certain features of the shinden
creations-chat 2019-06-16 12:18:34 I also want it to function though so
creations-chat 2019-06-16 12:18:56 If I attach the wing rudders I have to have less wing which isnt good for actually being able to fly
creations-chat 2019-06-16 12:19:17 because obviously i'd have to place a block for the rudders to attach to
creations-chat 2019-06-16 12:19:27 I just said *if*
creations-chat 2019-06-16 12:19:41 there's not enough control surfaces anyway because of the wing gear lol
creations-chat 2019-06-16 12:20:02 man i wonder what the issue could possibly be
creations-chat 2019-06-16 12:20:09 grgugrugruhgr
creations-chat 2019-06-16 12:20:12 of course it posts in <#384025409945337856>
creations-chat 2019-06-16 12:20:38 yeah but that makes the wing look bad
creations-chat 2019-06-16 12:21:24 i was aiming more for general appearance and functionality
creations-chat 2019-06-16 12:21:44 instead of absolute similarity
creations-chat 2019-06-16 13:27:42 <@!191446848999915520> wouldnt an ugly wing make it look even more makeshift
creations-chat 2019-06-16 14:51:45 ~~doesnt even have insignias smh~~
creations-chat 2019-06-16 14:52:08 like u then
creations-chat 2019-06-16 14:52:55 where's the magnum bomb bay

creations-chat 2019-06-17 17:46:29 <@!433382706143821834> what did u dislike about my carrier and how can i improve
creations-chat 2019-06-17 18:00:07 obviously because i dont know how to or want to do folds lol
creations-chat 2019-06-17 18:00:26 this is true
creations-chat 2019-06-17 18:00:39 probably yea
creations-chat 2019-06-17 18:03:04 i see

creations-chat 2019-06-19 06:39:34 <@305378911938936833> what makes it look different from a 109
creations-chat 2019-06-19 06:43:46 elaborate
creations-chat 2019-06-19 07:29:46 what aircraft does it look closer to
creations-chat 2019-06-19 16:37:14 Generic Utility Vehicle, (very) loosely based on the AEC. Drives and swims.
creations-chat 2019-06-19 16:37:39 
creations-chat 2019-06-19 16:54:38 >everything small looks shit
>no offense
creations-chat 2019-06-19 16:56:05 can you do better, leg
creations-chat 2019-06-19 16:56:26 <@!429665143677255681> madlad
creations-chat 2019-06-19 16:57:19 <@!185171693566689280> most people make small aircraft that look like real ones because they're better to fly
creations-chat 2019-06-19 16:57:23 noone likes having to make massive chunky boys
creations-chat 2019-06-19 16:58:58 aren't control surfaces supposed to be on the wings
creations-chat 2019-06-19 16:59:29 control surfaces are weak, that's why like 80% of the wing ends up control surface
creations-chat 2019-06-19 16:59:39 that's a fault of the game that causes the small aircraft to look "choppy"
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:00:51 obviously the faster you go the more air goes under them, but since i make small aircraft i dont want to have half of my aircraft as engines
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:01:19 <@!295568493166985218> probably almost 2k parts because of all the single-pieces in the fuselage and engine pods
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:01:46 there's not really a 'but still'
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:02:28 if you smack 20 rockets on it
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:02:29 apparently
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:04:28 tbf the game's physics isnt exactly amazing <@!295568493166985218>
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:05:08 No dont get me wrong, I really love the game
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:05:10 and I like making aircraft
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:05:18 but some slack should be cut in most cases
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:05:59 jet engines are decent depending on the aircraft you put them on
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:06:02 they're good for small aircraft
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:06:09 at least in my experience of making small aircraft
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:06:23 Rockets are too heavy, propellers aren't strong enough <@!295568493166985218>
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:07:59 noone challenged you to anything but if you want to man
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:09:06 james didnt you start this discussion with "small builds look choppy and bad"
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:09:25 nevermind that was leg
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:09:26 yea
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:09:44 nice ad hominem
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:09:49 redirecting the argument at a person rather than the actual topic
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:11:53 super rockets are heavy
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:12:43 tbf jets arent strong enough
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:12:55 the super jet can barely lift my 230~ part vtol
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:13:32 are you
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:13:43 sorry the "huge" jet engine is vague
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:13:52 pretty much the same meaning
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:14:00 yes
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:15:11 im sure you got the meaning
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:15:12 anyway
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:15:16 the huge jet engine isnt strong enough
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:15:45 huge jets are struggling to lift my 284 part vtol
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:16:08 wtf is a magnet drive
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:17:34 how big is it, decid
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:17:52 how big is it
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:18:36 yeah see the problem there is it's not to scale for a ho229
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:18:41 it looks great
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:18:44 and it probably flies great
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:18:49 but people like myself like to match the scale
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:19:43 ~~haha jameson is able to drive but still can't stop himself from askin someone's age on a discord for a digital lego game~~
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:19:53 yeah see it looks really nice
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:20:46 unfortunately james the discord terms of service also stop adults from asking the age of minors
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:21:03 it doesnt actually it just means you look like a pedo for askin
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:21:11 <@456226577798135808> your ho229 looks really nice :
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:22:30 i dont think you actually have a right to do that though bro
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:22:39 because that leads to sketchy situations
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:22:52 "i'm a moderator now tell me your age"
>"mr moderator i am (xyz age)
"kinky"
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:23:20 how do you prove you are above 13
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:23:49 a roblox registered age does not equal actual age

creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:30:02 yeah but has it been done for *landing gear*
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:30:39 clearly
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:30:55 no my issue is that noones provided a source that is 2-point folding landing gear
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:31:33 but you have no source
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:32:03 but noone has done it for landing gear <:lmfao:527971550360633393>
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:32:28 but see kip
noone has provided a gif yet
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:33:10 but noone has provided a gif yet of someone doing the same
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:33:23 so it cannot be verified
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:33:50 that looks really buggy robo
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:34:33 but *my* mechanism isnt <:lmfao:527971550360633393>
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:35:00 but, farollo, noone has provided a gif proving such

creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:36:07 kip so far noone has provided a gif proving that i am not in fact the first to do this with landing gear
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:36:33 it was oriingally going to be for a catalina and then i was like "bruh what if i imade it a vtol"
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:36:59 my actual catalina had gear that folded up and was not in fact two-part
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:37:38 i *wish* it had suspension lmao

creations-chat 2019-06-19 20:06:53 <@456226577798135808> adding more motors makes the aircraft look weird
creations-chat 2019-06-19 20:07:12 if there was a motor type that didnt have the annoying base then sure, i'd make a full engine, but just stacking motors looks bad
creations-chat 2019-06-19 20:07:39 yeah sure if you make like a 5x5 casing
creations-chat 2019-06-19 20:08:06 <:Thonk:509498568982134816>
creations-chat 2019-06-19 20:08:09 that looks weird though
creations-chat 2019-06-19 20:08:22 and in terms of hitboxes, that's still 5x5
creations-chat 2019-06-19 20:08:30 it looks and works fine as is :/
creations-chat 2019-06-19 20:08:56 show me
creations-chat 2019-06-19 20:09:36 i dont experiment with motor casings

help 2019-06-20 17:24:16 there must be a value somewhere so they can make control surfaces actually work properly

creations-chat 2019-07-13 20:43:44 i like those symbols
creations-chat 2019-07-13 20:51:02 can't be a gyazo link
help 2019-07-13 20:51:37 the lift coming from the rear rotors is too strong so it pitches forward, i assume
help 2019-07-13 20:52:04 that or the thrust moving forward isn't properly centred, making it's forward thrust wrong
creations-chat 2019-07-13 22:20:56 it's definitely unique
creations-chat 2019-07-13 22:21:04 cockpit could be better but no complaints other than that from me
creations-chat 2019-07-13 22:21:06 very nice aircraft
creations-chat 2019-07-14 11:05:09 Decid that sounds like a good way to make an elitist group

creations-chat 2019-07-14 21:22:16 everyone makes zeros too so
help 2019-07-14 21:22:53 the railing is too tall to properly land a helicopter
creations-chat 2019-07-14 21:31:06 or it's just there's not a lot of easy ways to do an mi-26 and make it look different
creations-chat 2019-07-14 21:31:32 to that scale anyway
help 2019-07-15 18:48:04 bulge bows are to add extra weight to the keel
creations-chat 2019-07-15 19:48:23 wedges please
creations-chat 2019-07-16 14:47:55 odd design
creations-chat 2019-07-16 14:49:58 nice though
creations-chat 2019-07-16 18:02:06 the wings are inaccurate
creations-chat 2019-07-16 18:02:20 <@!272852191054790656> very cute carrier 10/10
creations-chat 2019-07-16 22:06:35 that's a decent roll
creations-chat 2019-07-17 12:32:19 Turrets could do with a remake
creations-chat 2019-07-17 18:43:06 get a better turret shape
creations-chat 2019-07-17 18:43:25 also the lower 'level' of the deck could use some work
creations-chat 2019-07-17 18:43:38 and the bulge to account for the broadside turrets isnt present
creations-chat 2019-07-17 18:43:59 The centre mast and rear tower are too chunky
creations-chat 2019-07-17 18:44:11 the anchor releases at the front are inaccurate
creations-chat 2019-07-17 18:44:38 try half wedges for the mast instead of blocks
creations-chat 2019-07-17 18:44:41 it looks so chunky
creations-chat 2019-07-17 18:44:52 it's also missing the railing
creations-chat 2019-07-17 18:45:21 and for some reason the angling of the bow just sort of stops??? when the actual dreadnought continues to round off until the middle where it shapes into the stern
creations-chat 2019-07-17 18:45:41 another point is the lack of a Royal Navy flag made with trapdoors
creations-chat 2019-07-18 18:50:39 <@!285239279716663298> you did a bad job
creations-chat 2019-07-19 16:40:56 <@!451834969719832596> get a better paint scheme
creations-chat 2019-07-19 22:13:03 bro i think you should look at your references more and incorporate functionality later
creations-chat 2019-07-19 22:13:09 your wings are what, 3 blocks thick?
creations-chat 2019-07-19 22:13:19 no wonder they barely fly
creations-chat 2019-07-19 22:13:54 not make 3 block thick wings, clearly
creations-chat 2019-07-19 22:14:11 it's not difficult to make a prop engine flow into the wing well
creations-chat 2019-07-19 22:14:24 irl bomber engines are bigger than the wings they dont just slide in
creations-chat 2019-07-19 22:14:47 for the 219 maybe but the 111's wings are quite clearly 3 blocks thick
creations-chat 2019-07-19 22:14:49 yea
creations-chat 2019-07-19 22:14:59 Irl heinkel engines are larger than the wing width
creations-chat 2019-07-19 22:15:06 by a fair amount too
creations-chat 2019-07-19 22:15:23 another issue i can see is the wings are too far forward by like
creations-chat 2019-07-19 22:15:24 a block
creations-chat 2019-07-19 22:15:49 fair
creations-chat 2019-07-19 22:16:21 tbh i think you just have to look at your reference images more and maybe plan ahead if you dont already
creations-chat 2019-07-21 13:35:52 to be fair his me262 is unpainted
creations-chat 2019-07-21 13:36:07 and the rudder doesnt look quite right
creations-chat 2019-07-21 13:36:13 i can understand why someone who's nitpicky might downvote
creations-chat 2019-07-21 13:36:15 but i have upvoted
creations-chat 2019-07-21 13:36:18 because 262 is cool
creations-chat 2019-07-21 13:37:04 the only issue i can see is parts of the tail dont curve back like they do on the actual aircraft but obviously that can be difficult in plane crazy
creations-chat 2019-07-21 13:37:36 that and you put propellers in the front of the engines but that's nitpicking at that point
creations-chat 2019-07-21 13:37:51 I mean not just that but like
creations-chat 2019-07-21 13:38:00 rounded edges for wing tips
creations-chat 2019-07-21 13:38:06 and + and T shaped wing panels
creations-chat 2019-07-21 13:38:19 because sometimes you just need a T or + joint
creations-chat 2019-07-21 13:38:31 why not just put in an actual jet engine
creations-chat 2019-07-21 13:38:39 propellers look kinda stupid in game tbh
creations-chat 2019-07-21 13:39:05 propellers just look bad and dont do much overall
creations-chat 2019-07-21 13:39:15 unless you're turning a small tank or using it for water propulsion
creations-chat 2019-07-21 13:39:22 or maybe minor directional changes on helicopters
creations-chat 2019-07-21 13:39:25 pretty limited use
creations-chat 2019-07-21 13:40:02 Another nitpicky issue is that the engine doesnt blend into the wing like the actual aircraft but again
creations-chat 2019-07-21 13:40:08 plane crazy can be annoying to blend with
creations-chat 2019-07-21 13:40:32 >any military aircraft
creations-chat 2019-07-21 13:40:39 Haunebu time
creations-chat 2019-07-21 13:40:49 Is A Missile An Aircraft

creations-chat 2019-07-21 13:41:36 replace the props with small jet engines facing forward so you can see hte intake
creations-chat 2019-07-21 13:42:12 could i make my aircraft carrier fly and say it's a future military aircraft
creations-chat 2019-07-21 13:42:26 has anyone actually made an effective flying carrier
creations-chat 2019-07-21 13:43:30 Ultimately you could go for a sort of Akron system
creations-chat 2019-07-21 13:43:34 with aircraft that drop down
creations-chat 2019-07-21 13:43:38 rather than taking off from a runway
creations-chat 2019-07-21 13:44:13 Kind of?
creations-chat 2019-07-21 13:44:22 more like the US Navy Airship Akron
creations-chat 2019-07-21 13:44:43 yea
creations-chat 2019-07-21 13:50:55 try the P-61 Black Widow
creations-chat 2019-07-21 13:50:58 that's got a decent shape
creations-chat 2019-07-21 13:51:04 and plenty of features
creations-chat 2019-07-21 13:51:37 or the A-6 Intruder
creations-chat 2019-07-21 13:52:05 actually it had radar too
creations-chat 2019-07-21 13:52:16 and the general shape is different
creations-chat 2019-07-21 13:52:21 especially the nose and stuff
