plane-crazy 2020-06-23 01:29:32 that time iran went to war with iraq
plane-crazy 2020-06-23 01:29:25 f
plane-crazy 2020-06-23 01:27:34 wonder if we'd see more harriers and stuff if falklands war won
plane-crazy 2020-06-01 04:38:24 Really limits what you can do with it visually as a naval cannon
plane-crazy 2020-06-01 04:38:08 Cannon should just be a 3x long cylinder tbh
plane-crazy 2020-05-17 00:02:52 It fires police cars

plane-crazy 2020-03-12 22:05:19 That's like a solid 40 degrees
plane-crazy 2020-03-12 19:23:49 Too weak of an angle
plane-crazy 2020-03-09 18:05:21 sure if you hate flying
plane-crazy 2020-03-09 18:04:51 It's plane crazy ur options for wings are paper or chunky af

plane-crazy 2020-03-01 15:11:34 Same length same width
plane-crazy 2020-03-01 15:10:57 They're the same fuckin width vehicle as well
plane-crazy 2020-02-27 16:39:48 or maybe it doesnt idk
plane-crazy 2020-02-27 16:39:45 seems like a good idea but Im not entirely sure about how much it widens the turning circle for the wheels
plane-crazy 2020-02-22 18:56:50 good joke
plane-crazy 2020-02-22 18:56:49 >f3x is useless

plane-crazy 2020-02-20 17:43:42 can't make long trains because the plot's too small
plane-crazy 2020-02-20 17:43:37 I wish it was easier to make smaller/larger trains
plane-crazy 2020-02-18 15:57:50 turret also doesnt reach the edge
plane-crazy 2020-02-18 15:57:46 go for a sharper edge
plane-crazy 2020-02-18 15:57:43 Panther turret isnt that sloped
plane-crazy 2020-02-18 15:55:09 fat turret

plane-crazy 2020-01-25 02:29:52 sure but i looked up b5n2 model 1 and it's a similar cowling
plane-crazy 2020-01-25 02:29:28 in every image i can find the engine cowling is thinner than the fuselage though

plane-crazy 2020-01-14 23:19:38 
plane-crazy 2020-01-14 23:07:56 How can I fix fishtailing on mouse guided missiles
plane-crazy 2020-01-14 22:56:56 other than speed of motors
plane-crazy 2020-01-14 22:56:52 How can i fix fishtailing on MsGMs
plane-crazy 2020-01-14 20:28:54 no.
plane-crazy 2020-01-14 17:04:31 h
plane-crazy 2020-01-14 17:04:31 oh shit right yeah because if you start fishtailing the entire missile still tires to go back to that
plane-crazy 2020-01-14 16:59:38 How can I reduce fish-tailing and handling on mouse-guided missiles
plane-crazy 2020-01-13 05:16:15 3 or 4

plane-crazy 2020-01-12 01:52:09 cylinder barrels looked cringe
plane-crazy 2020-01-12 01:50:03 hence *over* land
plane-crazy 2020-01-12 01:49:59 not if over is used as a preposition
plane-crazy 2020-01-12 01:49:02 the same way an aircraft travels over land but a tank doesnt fly when it moves over land
plane-crazy 2020-01-12 01:48:50 but even that depends on your usage of the word "over"
plane-crazy 2020-01-12 01:48:43 fair enough, over water

plane-crazy 2020-01-03 04:40:35 This is his carrier
plane-crazy 2020-01-03 04:39:54 the original monitor it's based on was commissioned in 1918 and used to help shell Gold Beach in '44
plane-crazy 2020-01-03 04:39:27 oui
plane-crazy 2020-01-03 04:39:11 Mentions: xookdook1
plane-crazy 2020-01-03 04:39:03 Somewhere
plane-crazy 2020-01-03 04:38:59 You could probably find it in <#384025409945337856>
plane-crazy 2020-01-03 04:38:50 Tbf my monitor is 4000+ blocks and the turret gave me a headache making iy
plane-crazy 2020-01-03 04:38:26 Rather than following the plan >:(
plane-crazy 2020-01-03 04:38:08 And laurence the lazy bastard slapped a carrier deck on it
plane-crazy 2020-01-03 04:38:00 so naturally I went to my friends like "Hey what if we had a fleet"
plane-crazy 2020-01-03 04:37:42 I made a Royal Navy styled Monitor based on the one that helped shell Gold Beach on d-day
plane-crazy 2020-01-03 04:37:00 Could you imagine?
plane-crazy 2020-01-03 04:36:53 Imagine being the fuckin loser that makes a carrier based on my monitor hull
plane-crazy 2020-01-03 04:31:11 Vixo what timezone are you in  <@272125457703501826>

plane-crazy 2019-12-29 19:14:28 reverse 1920s
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 19:14:24 someone should make a battleship out of an aircraft carrier hull
plane-crazy 2019-12-28 17:52:42 bold of you to assume they dont freeze over in the cold areas necessary to keep the hull frozen
plane-crazy 2019-12-28 17:52:15 habakkuk

plane-crazy 2019-12-21 22:56:58 Smerch hours
plane-crazy 2019-12-20 00:40:13 a port probably
plane-crazy 2019-12-20 00:39:37 It's either parts sticking out with extra space or less space and it staying flat
plane-crazy 2019-12-20 00:39:16 fair enough I suppose
plane-crazy 2019-12-20 00:38:41 I have them on my 388
plane-crazy 2019-12-20 00:38:29 it gives a roughly flat surface and means you can build completely inside the part
plane-crazy 2019-12-20 00:38:02 Those are disconnectors
plane-crazy 2019-12-20 00:37:46 custom propellers gman
plane-crazy 2019-12-20 00:37:28 add a pyramid to the end
plane-crazy 2019-12-20 00:36:31 Guess I'll die
plane-crazy 2019-12-20 00:36:11 Turrets remind me of Orion
plane-crazy 2019-12-20 00:33:16 bruh when

plane-crazy 2019-12-18 23:51:11 if you want to land larger aircraft then folds are involved
plane-crazy 2019-12-18 23:51:00 well
plane-crazy 2019-12-18 23:45:59 Russian carriers are wacky
plane-crazy 2019-12-18 23:45:52 Potentially??? Unsure
plane-crazy 2019-12-18 23:45:41 not that I can tell
plane-crazy 2019-12-18 23:45:26 nice solomons nice
plane-crazy 2019-12-18 23:45:16 see above
plane-crazy 2019-12-18 23:44:50 <@511031042186936347>
plane-crazy 2019-12-18 23:44:26 Longer wedges at the bottom basically
plane-crazy 2019-12-18 23:44:10 It needs to slope like a _/ and not a /-
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 18:45:38 drinked
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 18:30:22 motor^2 is piston
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 09:50:11 Yeah I wanna make a natter interceptor
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 09:49:37 with a single shot and multishot variant by the looks
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 09:49:24 I assume it fires a rocket-like projectile that explodes after X distance  <@451025784228806656>
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 09:47:45 That way we can colour the pods without colouring rockets but can have them the same colour if we want
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 09:47:24 Inside
plane-crazy 2019-12-16 18:04:22 me when i XXXXXXX

plane-crazy 2019-12-16 00:48:41 WoWs has a few official models up on sketchfab
plane-crazy 2019-12-16 00:48:11 I use it all the time for my stuff
plane-crazy 2019-12-16 00:48:05 Sketchfab is a 3d model site
plane-crazy 2019-12-16 00:12:03 But only one side
plane-crazy 2019-12-16 00:11:59 9 attached to outriggers on the side
plane-crazy 2019-12-16 00:11:41 3 on the sides.
plane-crazy 2019-12-16 00:11:00 Three but on the bow
plane-crazy 2019-12-16 00:10:44 At least 1
plane-crazy 2019-12-16 00:10:32 1

plane-crazy 2019-12-15 11:53:46 large
plane-crazy 2019-12-14 22:37:13 no normal person anyway
plane-crazy 2019-12-14 22:37:06 noone really makes guns larger than 1x1
plane-crazy 2019-12-14 22:37:01 debatable
plane-crazy 2019-12-14 22:36:22 like it is currently
plane-crazy 2019-12-14 22:36:16 leave it to the people to add cosmetics
plane-crazy 2019-12-14 22:36:11 we just need a 1x3 tube that fires explosive projectiles
plane-crazy 2019-12-14 22:35:41 we just need a tube dude

plane-crazy 2019-12-14 22:35:25 rick said he'll change it
plane-crazy 2019-12-14 22:35:22 only in their current model
plane-crazy 2019-12-14 20:38:55 10 conveyor drive jet

plane-crazy 2019-12-14 20:37:18 supersonic jet
plane-crazy 2019-12-14 20:36:05 bruh why
plane-crazy 2019-12-14 20:36:03 oh l shaped
plane-crazy 2019-12-14 20:36:01 that's not i-shaped what
plane-crazy 2019-12-14 20:35:46 yeah i dont get it
plane-crazy 2019-12-14 20:35:33 what
plane-crazy 2019-12-14 20:33:48 vietnamese fighter nice
plane-crazy 2019-12-14 20:29:33 epic
plane-crazy 2019-12-14 19:23:55 i really wish plane crazy physics allowed for no-thrusters/props/whatever mech legs
plane-crazy 2019-12-14 18:46:56 loser
plane-crazy 2019-12-14 18:46:55 fuckin
plane-crazy 2019-12-14 18:46:53 then why'd you say "no rocket pod dont do that"
plane-crazy 2019-12-14 18:46:34 rocket pods fire 1 at a time battleship you massive nerd
plane-crazy 2019-12-14 18:46:02 i dont know why it wouldn
plane-crazy 2019-12-14 18:46:00 I hope tapping once makes it fire once
plane-crazy 2019-12-14 18:44:39 finally i can make a Natter
plane-crazy 2019-12-14 18:37:57 that looks like an ontos
plane-crazy 2019-12-14 18:25:57 *and* make it into galleon guns
plane-crazy 2019-12-14 18:25:31 then you could make it into gun-pods, tank barrels, battleship guns, etc
plane-crazy 2019-12-14 18:25:17 so much more could be done with just a 1x3 tube that fires explosive projectiles
plane-crazy 2019-12-14 18:24:29 vip cringe.
plane-crazy 2019-12-14 18:24:20 i think just a 1x3 cylinder that fires explosive shells would be way better
plane-crazy 2019-12-14 18:24:03 eh pirate cannon barrels will look goofy on tanks and things
plane-crazy 2019-12-14 18:23:49 if it's just a barrel we can make it into whatever we want more easily
plane-crazy 2019-12-14 18:23:36 no <@!238017332872478720> what
plane-crazy 2019-12-14 18:23:22 a tube. ™️
plane-crazy 2019-12-14 18:23:18 that fires shells that explode like a battleship shell or tank shell
plane-crazy 2019-12-14 18:23:07 literally a tube
plane-crazy 2019-12-14 18:23:06 something like this
plane-crazy 2019-12-14 18:22:27 not a modern cannon just something with cannon physics
plane-crazy 2019-12-14 18:21:44 rick is the cannon model gonna be changed at all
plane-crazy 2019-12-14 18:21:12 it breaks on especially large creations and stuff
plane-crazy 2019-12-14 18:20:52 (yes motors need fixing valo)
plane-crazy 2019-12-14 18:20:22 currently the game needs optimising and a few overhauls
plane-crazy 2019-12-14 18:20:11 yeah i respect rick and what he's adding but more needs to be fixed than added
plane-crazy 2019-12-14 18:11:11 rick fix the cannons pleas
plane-crazy 2019-12-14 18:10:50 lol turbo chill
plane-crazy 2019-12-14 17:47:43 ah yes of course

plane-crazy 2019-12-13 17:27:36 the entire airport was a prefab by blackbird
plane-crazy 2019-12-13 17:27:05 we know
plane-crazy 2019-12-13 17:27:04 henk's idea was good but the execution was bad

plane-crazy 2019-12-13 00:42:41 Like I can think of a few reasons but why
plane-crazy 2019-12-13 00:42:33 Whyd you downvote this vip
plane-crazy 2019-12-13 00:42:27 
plane-crazy 2019-12-13 00:41:44 Yup you downvoted my De Havilland Vampire
plane-crazy 2019-12-13 00:40:49 P.sure you downvoted at least one of my builds
plane-crazy 2019-12-13 00:40:39 You judge way too critically though dude
plane-crazy 2019-12-13 00:39:24 Noones angered by text fidankn scroll up
plane-crazy 2019-12-13 00:39:00 Noone can, realistically
plane-crazy 2019-12-13 00:38:53 Because normal people can't over text
plane-crazy 2019-12-13 00:38:29 Right but assuming you couldn't tell, you wouldn't assume that was a joke
plane-crazy 2019-12-13 00:37:46 Vip if I said "why is your mother the size of a house she's ugly enough already" but said it as a joke would you get annoyed or assume it was a joke
plane-crazy 2019-12-13 00:37:00 <@272125457703501826> tbf everyone makes carriers
plane-crazy 2019-12-13 00:36:45 you can't tell tone over text dude
plane-crazy 2019-12-13 00:36:38 most people can't tell if you just say it bluntly
plane-crazy 2019-12-13 00:35:38 I don't think he's playing victim I think he's just jaded

plane-crazy 2019-12-12 16:56:41 it doesn't allow for stacking or placement in literally any vehicle post 1800s
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 16:56:17 just an actual cannon
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 16:56:11 but he made it a cannon
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 16:56:05 like again a tube would allow for more creative freedom
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 16:55:47 It kinda goes against plane crazy commonplace to have it be a full cannon too
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 16:55:22 yeah
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 16:54:20 he could literally give us a hollow 1x3 cylinder with a black circle at one end and it would be better
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 16:53:40 Rick that's not what we meant by cannon >:(

plane-crazy 2019-12-10 22:14:22 it's a demand now 🔫
plane-crazy 2019-12-10 22:12:15 Maybe if we bully the motors to work
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 23:53:43 Pretty epic
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 23:08:35 what did you get aero expert for
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 23:08:23 b r u h
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 23:08:07 <@!421848903361757184> bruh
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 22:43:37 <@322970944303923200> nice
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 22:43:35 speed is irrelevant if we all do things differently
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 22:43:13 no
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 22:42:28 ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 22:42:16 this was my, admittedly underdeveloped, concept when I was sitll in Team 2
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 22:41:35 not a community project
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 22:41:29 what no
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 22:41:26 yeah
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 22:41:10 again, henk's concpet is better than what we produced
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 22:40:52 both maps don't really give a sense of improvement over the current map
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 22:40:43 Henk had a good concpet but the team made it badly
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 22:40:30 henk's map concept is better than the execution
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 22:40:17 basically both maps aren't great tbh
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 22:39:42 the larger parts of the water are blocked from larger ships by bridges, the airport looks wack, the terrain isn't arranged aesthetically
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 22:39:00 there's just too much *stuff* and it's poorly organised
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 22:38:44 wolf your map's too cluttered
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 22:37:48 and then i had to rejoin
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 22:37:40 leon kicked me out without telling me halfway through so
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 22:37:21 ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 22:36:53 ultimately our map was kinda rushed and bad
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 22:36:17 and had no railing
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 22:36:15 and thin
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 22:36:14 and badly coloured
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 22:36:12 the roads were unioned??? for some reason????
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 22:36:08 the airports were someone's prefab, moc had to make the one in the city
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 22:35:53 underdeveloped
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 22:35:51 seabee most of the stuff in our map was just
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 22:29:41 the railway is epic
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 22:29:25 you dont have to teleport nearly as far to spawn in the ocean, rail, or airport
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 22:29:13 like
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 22:29:02 it's just cringe
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 22:29:00 i dont get wanting void behind the plots either
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 22:28:48 ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 22:28:47 but the plots dont connect
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 22:28:42 like i'd love to drag my ju388 around with a neutered Puma
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 22:28:18 means taxi craft would be useful
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 22:28:13 Its especially good because the plots lead to the runway
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 17:13:45 ^
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 17:12:42 Vietnam was a mistake by America who was high off the freedom train from Korea
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 17:12:13 Unless he was caught by the draft then he deserved it
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 17:11:46 America shouldn't have even been in the region hank
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 17:11:36 No General, Major, Officer, or acting President during Vietnam who didn't pull America out should be shunned
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 17:10:43 The only soldiers who deserved a thanking for their service was those caught by the draft
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 17:10:17 Fuckin "let's sail near Vietnam with a warship"
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 17:10:04 The Tonkin incident was due to American intervention in the first place
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 17:09:43 Vietnam isn't Japan you dumbass
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 17:09:20 America intervened in affairs that weren't it's own and suffered for it, causing the Vietnamese service
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 17:08:53 No, America ruined Vietnam
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 17:08:29 America ruined Vietnam
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 17:08:25 Vietnam wasnt particularly top notch to begin with moc
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 17:08:03 Henk's map was a good concept but badly executed by us tbh
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 17:07:29 I voted wolf because self-upvote is cringe
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 17:01:01 it's a large expansion but not yuge
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 17:00:48 It'll take barely longer to travel
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 16:56:29 Henk's map concept was better than what we put together
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 16:52:46 If you've got a mast why are you going through it
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 16:52:30 If you saw a person next to it then you'd get it ™
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 16:52:10 same with my submarine
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 16:52:04 My cb90 will absolutely get through there and it's a bit wide
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 16:51:40 I had to deepen that canal lmao
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 16:47:07 The city in our map is basically attrition's city
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 16:46:28 Henk the concept was better than the execution for our one
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 16:46:12 A  city where the method of making it is stolen from attrition is kinda cringe
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 16:45:49 Our roads are stinky
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 16:44:44 And the airports are stinky
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 16:44:23 The roads on our map sucked though
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 01:57:52 "homosexual above homosexual below" or as vixo would like to call it, a Wednesday night for him
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 01:37:01 K
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 01:33:32 I might do IJN Tone
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 01:31:53 The best DiY naval weapon is torpedoes
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 01:31:20 7achyon diy cannons occupy a dumb amount of space for what they do
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 01:30:46 <@414778672847781888> depends on scale
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 01:30:34 Guns bug out and client-side freeze parts they cut off
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 01:30:17 Said as someone with an interceptor with 7 guns on the interior
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 01:30:02 Guns suck against aircraft
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 01:29:41 <@414778672847781888> what
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 01:29:36 like I made a explosive ball flak gun and wanted to add a reload magazine and it just fuckin cringed everywhere
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 01:29:06 Not even reload ability just generally fitting a magazine or reload machinery is a chore
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 01:28:29 Especially an aircraft of a practical size
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 01:28:21 I've wanted to make an explosive ball cannon but I haven't been able to because of the space it occupies
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 01:27:55 Not on an aircraft
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 01:27:35 Occupies space though
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 01:26:10 Ive made good looking pvp capable vehicles what
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 01:25:14 pvp is underdeveloped but not a secondary part of the game
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 01:25:00 You made a doom satellite what
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 01:24:51 "Its for testing"
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 00:44:09 would be better if the barrel wasn't 3 rockets
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 00:33:51 I was gonna have a fit if that was a carrier deck
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 00:22:15 Moon *what*
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 00:21:41 nice
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 00:21:29 Ruski do you still have skis on that thing
plane-crazy 2019-12-08 22:11:30 found one
plane-crazy 2019-12-08 22:05:32 Anyone have any good wing iron crosses?
plane-crazy 2019-12-08 21:05:13 but I need rocket space
plane-crazy 2019-12-08 21:05:06 Irl the rear landing gear also went into the body
plane-crazy 2019-12-08 21:04:40 lorge
plane-crazy 2019-12-08 21:03:46 good first person flying too
plane-crazy 2019-12-08 21:03:18 because my harrier is too small to carry anything large
plane-crazy 2019-12-08 21:03:09 It's meant to be my new attack aircraft
plane-crazy 2019-12-08 21:02:34 I still need rear landing gear
plane-crazy 2019-12-08 21:02:28 unpainted underside
plane-crazy 2019-12-08 21:01:29 gotta get that lift yo
plane-crazy 2019-12-08 20:59:19 Junker Ju 388
plane-crazy 2019-12-07 15:55:25 that smoke looks neat
plane-crazy 2019-12-07 01:53:21 Who here binds things to Mouse1
plane-crazy 2019-12-07 01:46:24 guys the name changed
plane-crazy 2019-12-07 01:45:01 Try 12
plane-crazy 2019-12-07 01:41:34 it says right here where he died
plane-crazy 2019-12-07 01:41:25 no idra promised ME the mod in his will
plane-crazy 2019-12-07 01:40:51 He was oui
plane-crazy 2019-12-07 01:40:42 which is fair enough
plane-crazy 2019-12-07 01:40:36 he said he wanted to move on and this place is too toxic
plane-crazy 2019-12-07 01:40:11 he left
plane-crazy 2019-12-07 01:34:42 tenno haika banzaaaaaai
plane-crazy 2019-12-07 01:34:03 ah yes
"Japan smells reeeeeee", perfectly translated
plane-crazy 2019-12-06 18:24:35 why is there never anyone on the vip servers
plane-crazy 2019-12-06 18:20:27 smells like pvp server
plane-crazy 2019-12-06 16:51:46 Magnet gun?
plane-crazy 2019-12-06 15:14:11 <@257194741815312384> get motorised control surfaces you melon
plane-crazy 2019-12-06 15:13:57 I'm sure it's fine
plane-crazy 2019-12-06 15:13:53 Noone here's gonna say "uh HK deserved it"
plane-crazy 2019-12-06 15:13:29 Well, Mandarin
plane-crazy 2019-12-06 15:13:20 HK speaks Chinese but it's not Chinese
plane-crazy 2019-12-06 15:12:54 China has ripoff versions of basically every social media app so they can monitor it without breaking 50 laws
plane-crazy 2019-12-06 15:12:27 No lol
plane-crazy 2019-12-06 15:12:15 Nice
plane-crazy 2019-12-06 15:11:54 sorry "province of Taiwan"ese
plane-crazy 2019-12-06 15:11:32 mfw Taiwanese
plane-crazy 2019-12-06 15:08:01 China is the biggest uh oh stinky
plane-crazy 2019-12-06 15:07:06 Republic of China has claims on Mongolia and Tannu Tuva like it's fuckin hoi4 lol
plane-crazy 2019-12-06 15:04:41 Taiwan #1
plane-crazy 2019-12-06 12:41:02 I have some good builds that aren't super detailed
plane-crazy 2019-12-06 12:40:49 sure detail helps but it isn't necessarily required on all builds
plane-crazy 2019-12-06 12:34:48 Vip is cringe dw about it
plane-crazy 2019-12-06 03:03:37 it depends though
plane-crazy 2019-12-06 03:03:33 motor 2 can be fixed a lot of the time by replacing/reloading/rejoining a decent amount
plane-crazy 2019-12-06 02:57:48 sounds kinda cringe to me aliveminecraft
plane-crazy 2019-12-06 02:55:04 who knows maybe all this gets fixed for winter update
plane-crazy 2019-12-06 02:54:54 Rick probably has an irl life and that's why fixes are slow
plane-crazy 2019-12-06 00:57:22 not particularly well but it worked
plane-crazy 2019-12-06 00:57:15 It worked for me last time I used it
plane-crazy 2019-12-05 20:01:09 noobstone was criiiinge
plane-crazy 2019-12-05 20:00:57 lmao i had to forfeit against noobstone
plane-crazy 2019-12-05 03:09:03 fires like one too
plane-crazy 2019-12-05 03:08:59 I mostly hate how the wraith is used as a tank when it's armed like an artillery gun
plane-crazy 2019-12-05 03:08:30 I love and hate the halo 5 wraith
plane-crazy 2019-12-05 03:05:46 <@587406379451678722> ball cannon m?
plane-crazy 2019-12-05 03:03:23 Is the price gonna increase?
plane-crazy 2019-12-05 03:02:52 only if you have master chief collection
plane-crazy 2019-12-05 03:02:16 Puri dies making a b35
plane-crazy 2019-12-05 02:45:57 Rattlesnakes and alligators
plane-crazy 2019-12-05 02:45:53 oh way down south in the land of traitors
plane-crazy 2019-12-05 02:45:20 Confederate flag pfp doesn't get an opinion
plane-crazy 2019-12-05 02:45:08 imagine thinking Vietnam was reasonable
plane-crazy 2019-12-05 02:44:35 Slowmoding chat doesn't fix it bruh
plane-crazy 2019-12-05 02:44:22 It's fuckin somewhere else now
plane-crazy 2019-12-05 02:44:16 So
plane-crazy 2019-12-05 02:44:13 It was about the confederate flag and then it was tank decided "Vietnam, Korea, and Japan, deserved the warcrimes against them"
plane-crazy 2019-12-05 02:43:44 please learn history
plane-crazy 2019-12-05 02:43:28 tankent doesn't understand Vietnam
plane-crazy 2019-12-05 02:43:13 Dude the US entered a civil war that wasn't their business  <@267790590630952960>
plane-crazy 2019-12-05 02:42:55 Kinda did it to yerself
plane-crazy 2019-12-05 02:42:50 So like
plane-crazy 2019-12-05 02:42:45 Japan attacked the US because the US embargoed their oil
plane-crazy 2019-12-05 02:42:14 NK fuckin sucked but Vietnam going communist was never the US' business
plane-crazy 2019-12-05 02:41:57 Deserved what?
plane-crazy 2019-12-05 02:41:46 yup  <@409529151880429581>
plane-crazy 2019-12-05 02:41:31 The US moved on
plane-crazy 2019-12-05 02:41:04 You can't pass off the PRC, confederate, or natzee flag as "just any flag"
plane-crazy 2019-12-05 02:40:40 Hsuenfidhrhr
plane-crazy 2019-12-05 02:40:18 Every modern country has shit history, some are worse than others obviously
plane-crazy 2019-12-05 02:40:01 I mean America sucks to shit anyway since the Union displaced hundreds of thousands of natives
plane-crazy 2019-12-05 02:39:32 where'd you get communist from maniaco lol
plane-crazy 2019-12-05 02:39:04 I never said they were hunter
plane-crazy 2019-12-05 02:38:39 Ultimately the confederate flag represents the defence of slavery and southern policies, the majority being immoral <:thconking:535171057649188865>
plane-crazy 2019-12-05 02:38:07 Am I wrong?
plane-crazy 2019-12-05 02:36:33 Seriously playing dumb and acting like the confederate flag is just like any other flag is stupid
plane-crazy 2019-12-05 02:36:13 because the South absolutely did not want to give up slavery as most of their industry and agriculture depended on it
plane-crazy 2019-12-05 02:35:51 sure, among other policies, but the Confederate flag represents the *defence* of slavery
plane-crazy 2019-12-05 02:35:16 Because the confederate flag represents the defence of slavery lol
plane-crazy 2019-12-05 02:34:54 It boils down to disagreements over slavery especially in giving new states the choice of slavery or not.
plane-crazy 2019-12-05 02:34:04 States rights to do what exactly  <@456226577798135808>
plane-crazy 2019-12-05 02:33:54 <@429131077035229184> learn *your* history you ignorant dunce
plane-crazy 2019-12-05 02:33:34 The confederate flag represents the southern states that seceded from the American Union as a result of disagreements over slavery and ultimately, failure of consistency from the North to keep the Slave South/Slave-free North State Rule as the US government had started giving states *the option* of having slavery or not having slavery.
plane-crazy 2019-12-05 00:53:06 Magnet drives are at least a lil controllable
plane-crazy 2019-12-05 00:52:43 Not everyone wants that much speed
plane-crazy 2019-12-05 00:18:19 Deck melted
plane-crazy 2019-12-05 00:18:14 Ouef
plane-crazy 2019-12-05 00:18:08 1 blimp?
plane-crazy 2019-12-05 00:14:42 Inb4 puri starts making zeppelin aircraft carriers like Akron
plane-crazy 2019-12-05 00:11:32 ***why***
plane-crazy 2019-12-05 00:11:21 Jesus christ
plane-crazy 2019-12-05 00:10:35 puri make a seaplane tender
plane-crazy 2019-12-05 00:09:45 What'd you get muted for
plane-crazy 2019-12-05 00:09:15 ßaratoga
plane-crazy 2019-12-05 00:08:27 release the blueprints
plane-crazy 2019-12-05 00:07:58 No illustrious, no unicorn, no hermes
plane-crazy 2019-12-05 00:07:48 or at least very few make British carriers
plane-crazy 2019-12-05 00:07:40 Noone makes British carriers or seaplane tenders
plane-crazy 2019-12-05 00:07:03 Mfw Ryujo
plane-crazy 2019-12-05 00:06:50 My 2nd was okay but undetailed
plane-crazy 2019-12-05 00:06:20 Only as long as the plot
plane-crazy 2019-12-05 00:06:14 My 1st had no folds lol
plane-crazy 2019-12-05 00:05:55 I've made 4 carriers
plane-crazy 2019-12-05 00:05:22 You've trashed **6**?
plane-crazy 2019-12-05 00:01:15 this is me when purified makes the 500th carrier this hour
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 22:27:52 I wanna land on it
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 22:24:49 Mini ships
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 22:14:34 <@456226577798135808> show it to us
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 21:19:06 why are you continuing construction of a broken vessel, comrade
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 21:17:46 i was joking
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 21:16:27 it's ***clearly*** the KLM livery
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 20:37:39 But longg
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 20:37:34 It'd be thin
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 20:37:29 box fold both ends
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 20:37:12 Puri and vixo should make a carrier fusion
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 20:30:24 <@195253906333368320> I made motor 2 work with the CIWS so we can retry at some point
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 19:55:34 makes sense
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 19:54:18 your water should be more whitish blue
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 19:16:04 wew
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 19:16:03 the ciws tube works now
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 18:43:36 I need to test my ciws shotgun
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 18:43:29 me
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 18:42:25 There's a distinct lack of MGM's in vip2 fellas
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 18:35:22 someone with mouse-guided missiles join me on vip 2

plane-crazy 2019-12-04 18:30:50 It's length also doesnt give amazing coverage across a vessel
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 18:30:37 It's not got a great spread but ultimately if a mouse-guided missile is on it's approach it's probably not moving evasively

plane-crazy 2019-12-04 17:25:01 I think you're just laggy
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 17:24:43 Yeah but that doesn't mean it'll be more powerful or controllable
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 17:24:02 Basically it's better to make DIY weapons rather than stock
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 17:23:26 Diy torps are literally stronger
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 17:22:47 >people suggesting torpedoes

plane-crazy 2019-11-28 00:09:01 Floating
plane-crazy 2019-11-27 21:23:49 The text seems bolder
plane-crazy 2019-11-27 21:23:28 rejoin vip 1 losers
plane-crazy 2019-11-26 00:19:16 Elaborate
plane-crazy 2019-11-26 00:12:25 So do huge jets
plane-crazy 2019-11-26 00:12:18 water propellers suck I hate them
plane-crazy 2019-11-26 00:11:55 Therefore the more water is in contact with sink blocks, the more you sink
plane-crazy 2019-11-26 00:11:36 When sinking is activated it will increase in density slowly up to 50
plane-crazy 2019-11-26 00:11:07 A block that has a sink value that is only activated when touching water
plane-crazy 2019-11-26 00:10:43 Consider:
plane-crazy 2019-11-26 00:10:30 I want to sink let me sink reee
plane-crazy 2019-11-26 00:10:14 so are guns not being 1x1x0.5
plane-crazy 2019-11-26 00:09:59 it's cringe and horrible
plane-crazy 2019-11-26 00:09:39 as are the lack of armour values and actual cannons for ships, tanks, etc rather than having to spam rockets
plane-crazy 2019-11-26 00:09:04 Gun bulletdrop and welding is cringe, oui?
plane-crazy 2019-11-26 00:08:37 Pvp weapons need a general rework anyway florida
plane-crazy 2019-11-26 00:08:05 One of those b17s is almost definitely purified
plane-crazy 2019-11-25 23:47:01 Who's arman
plane-crazy 2019-11-25 23:46:11 It's not even a thing that nerfs the gun it's just objectively bad
plane-crazy 2019-11-25 23:45:45 gun bullet drop rn kinda sucks though
plane-crazy 2019-11-25 23:44:54 it's mutually exclusive in pc usually
plane-crazy 2019-11-25 23:44:20 Designer tanks or tanks with actual armour
plane-crazy 2019-11-25 23:44:11 "actual good tanks"
plane-crazy 2019-11-25 23:43:47 don't be seen or dont give the possibility of being hit
plane-crazy 2019-11-25 23:43:29 I mean PC combat is basically
plane-crazy 2019-11-25 23:34:43 It tore through *beams* because beams are not good armour pieces
plane-crazy 2019-11-25 23:31:38 How so
plane-crazy 2019-11-25 23:31:23 Guns are balanced
plane-crazy 2019-11-25 22:14:01 I know him but I managed to escape him in my 200 speed Westland Whirlwidn

plane-crazy 2019-11-25 22:13:18 <@!646529931777409034> he's not that hard to evade

plane-crazy 2019-11-16 00:43:11 The collective iq of some people in this server is still below 50
plane-crazy 2019-11-16 00:42:49 Because you explicitly said you were doing it to lagbomb you actual dolt
plane-crazy 2019-11-16 00:42:22 Veloci you literally just stated your intent lmao

plane-crazy 2019-11-13 18:31:35 I told this to mocmish but the concept might need tweaking
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 18:31:24 Tnt is on same everything but like 40 impact speed for basic testing
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 18:31:09 Suspension has to have a low enough stiffness for the half block to basically compress into the explosive and detonate
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 18:30:52 Basically

Impact explosive
Suspension
Half block

plane-crazy 2019-11-13 18:10:53 Lmao
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 18:10:39 I fuckin wish cars became tanks
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 18:07:42 I'll get on pc in a min lemme finish eating
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 18:07:15 You and Solomons pinged me like 8 hours ago for something
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 18:06:50 No before that
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 18:06:24 <@191446848999915520> what did you ping me for earlier
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 18:06:15 Let's move on since dark is stuck in ww2
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 18:05:30 And Nicholas Moran was an Abrams driver
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 18:05:19 As did Nicholas Moran
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 18:05:14 I'm pretty sure lindybeige has literally said before that attack aircraft did surprisingly little against tanks in ww2
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 18:04:30 And in the future tanks, or another armoured substitute, will continue in their role
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 18:04:03 Tanks helped win ww2 more than attack aircraft did  <@322970944303923200>
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 18:03:26 You need an armoured support unit to help infantry on the ground either way
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 18:03:01 Tanks will continue as long as ground warfare continues
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 18:02:31 Planes also didn't win the Falklands, the Royal Navy did with the ASSISTANCE or aircraft in a SUPPORTING ROLE
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 18:01:39 Vietnam wasn't won by the US what
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 18:01:25 Planes didn't win Vietnam <@322970944303923200>
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 18:01:15 Planes didn't win Vietnam
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 18:00:47 Planes can't defend a nation you tard
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:59:10 Thank you battleship
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:58:55 open topped tanks are hardly tanks lmao
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:58:42 HOLY ***SHIT***
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:58:32 ARTILLERY DOES NOT KILL TANKS
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:58:12 Tanks aren't the future they're the present and presently they work and will continue to work better than aircraft in ground-only infantry support
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:57:48 Those aren't comparable you retard they serve different purposes
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:57:05 MBT's exist because it's too expensive to also have TD's when ATGM exists
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:56:23 Artillery is used to stun or disorient an opposition and for softening up targets for a ground push
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:55:26 Artillery isn't built for killing tanks
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:55:15 What the fuck
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:54:51 Or yknow helicopters also using range to their advantage
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:54:41 Dark do you know what ecm and flares are
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:54:20 Also what decent attack aircraft only goes for tanks
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:53:40 I'm focusing on majors vs majors and can tell you that any decent tank group has MANPADS nearby or SPAAG, or is hidden well enough to remove either one
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:52:56 COMBINED ARMS WARFARE
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:52:50 Get this dark right I know this is a crazy idea to you
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:52:31 Aircraft are not the ultimate war-ending weapon get your head out of ww2
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:51:56 Also an airstrike implies the tank is spotted lmao
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:51:42 BECAUSE ANY DECENT TANK IS IN COVER, HAS SPAAG NEARBY, OR HAS MANPADS NEARBY
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:51:14 Tanks are to support infantry from range and kill other tanks
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:51:01 Tanks aren't meant to charge you tard
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:50:50 Panzerfaust 3 works in buildings but doesn't work when there's a 120mm firing from several kilometres away on open ground
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:50:24 Tanks aren't meant to get within that range  <@322970944303923200>
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:50:00 Guys I think dark is stupid
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:49:42 What the fuck no MG's, especially modern ones, are especially accurate and can easily suppress AND kill infantry
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:49:02 <@322970944303923200> do you have room temperature iq
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:48:54 Any decent tank can either escape or has infantry support wtf
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:48:32 Sure if the tanks fucking alone and not at range
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:48:06 You need 1 tank to support infantry and destroy other tanks
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:47:38 tanks don't have to fight aircraft
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:47:30 ManPADS deals with aircraft around a tank lmao
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:46:59 Tanks fight other tanks and also infantry
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:46:33 Also yeah tanks aren't meant to fight aircraft wtf
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:46:20 Depends on what the aircraft is using
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:45:55 Wait who the fuck said tanks are obsolete 🔫
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:45:31 The Germans cancelled the zeppelins because they were ineffective but they were aircraft that bombed
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:44:53 Bomber aircraft like zeppelins existed and at least did something
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:44:26 Bombers existed lmao  <@322970944303923200>
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:44:03 Germany won the air war over France but did not necessarily win on the ground
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:43:44 Not entirely true
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:43:40 ehhh
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:43:16 What's the topic
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 15:38:18 <@191446848999915520> what
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 00:17:07 I'm not versed on plane crazy history
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 00:16:58 What happened to deci anyway
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 00:16:07 I don't wanna get 4000 pounded bro pleaseeee
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 00:15:27 please don't cookie my ship please bro please
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 00:14:48 I just assumed colours were removed
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 00:14:42 I didn't know you needed an expert rank for colours
plane-crazy 2019-11-12 18:06:07 yea
plane-crazy 2019-11-12 17:17:26 just spun around using their blades
plane-crazy 2019-11-12 17:17:22 that aot player kinda sucked
plane-crazy 2019-11-12 01:19:29 Also what the fuck folds are those
plane-crazy 2019-11-12 01:19:21 The turret spacing is kinda quirky though
plane-crazy 2019-11-12 01:06:30 Boomer alert, a red spy is in the base
plane-crazy 2019-11-12 01:00:48 Mobile v2's were on launch rails with miniscule pads if any
plane-crazy 2019-11-12 01:00:21 Shut
plane-crazy 2019-11-12 01:00:01 It needs a pop-up rail not a fucking Elon pad
plane-crazy 2019-11-12 00:59:49 Launch pad???
plane-crazy 2019-11-12 00:59:37 V2's are basically terror weapons they suck at precision targeting
plane-crazy 2019-11-12 00:59:17 V2's were never used on ships
plane-crazy 2019-11-12 00:59:07 That's literally a US ship
plane-crazy 2019-11-12 00:58:18 Rockets are ineffective in naval combat
plane-crazy 2019-11-12 00:58:09 Unsurprisingly you need magnum recievers and transmitters as high as possible to maximise range
plane-crazy 2019-11-12 00:57:44 More radar and comms
plane-crazy 2019-11-12 00:57:30 Fuck's sakes
plane-crazy 2019-11-12 00:57:25 More radar
plane-crazy 2019-11-12 00:56:58 That image makes me think MAYBE smoke by based on where it is on the ship and it's placement I'm saying radar/comms
plane-crazy 2019-11-12 00:56:10 Suck my ass
plane-crazy 2019-11-12 00:55:53 hence why it's on the TOP
plane-crazy 2019-11-12 00:55:39 It's radar/comms you absolute speds
plane-crazy 2019-11-12 00:55:24 What sort of tard puts rockets on top of the citadel
plane-crazy 2019-11-12 00:55:05 It's fucking radar/comms
plane-crazy 2019-11-12 00:55:00 "Its a gun"

plane-crazy 2019-11-11 02:36:47 Russia would fucking die to Europe lmao
plane-crazy 2019-11-11 02:36:29 And the majority of their people doesn't have nearly the same spirit as it did in the USSR

plane-crazy 2019-11-08 21:57:51 Roberts class monitor underway
plane-crazy 2019-11-07 19:07:25 it's an expansion rather than a remake or a completely new map
plane-crazy 2019-11-07 19:07:17 hence why i prefer henk's design
plane-crazy 2019-11-07 19:06:59 and yea the grey area in the ocean is such a stain
plane-crazy 2019-11-07 19:06:21 especially since you can't spawn in the desert
plane-crazy 2019-11-07 19:06:12 that can't get up and over the hills
plane-crazy 2019-11-07 19:06:08 massive land vehicles
plane-crazy 2019-11-07 19:06:04 It'd be especially good for like
plane-crazy 2019-11-07 19:05:49 that could be cool
plane-crazy 2019-11-07 19:05:46 like a grey baseplate with a large ocean area that has nothing in it?
plane-crazy 2019-11-07 19:05:25 IT's cramped, but most things fit into it
plane-crazy 2019-11-07 19:05:12 I feel like a good thing about the current PC map is that it's pretty open to what you can shove in it
plane-crazy 2019-11-07 19:04:38 float planes and skiffs, exclusively
plane-crazy 2019-11-07 19:04:29 like what vehicles
plane-crazy 2019-11-07 19:04:21 what would you even make for a swamp

plane-crazy 2019-11-05 17:52:09 Might need some tweaking but the concept works
plane-crazy 2019-11-05 17:51:51 this is basically it
plane-crazy 2019-11-05 17:51:14 hold on
plane-crazy 2019-11-05 17:50:30 but yea should be able to
plane-crazy 2019-11-05 17:50:28 casing is a different matter
plane-crazy 2019-11-05 17:50:24 I mean the suspension, fuse block, and explosive are all 1x1
plane-crazy 2019-11-05 17:49:48 I Said Nice.
plane-crazy 2019-11-05 17:48:31 nice
plane-crazy 2019-11-05 17:48:14 what do i win
plane-crazy 2019-11-05 17:47:39 Pretty much
plane-crazy 2019-11-05 17:46:41 suspension compresses and detonates the explosive rather than shitty explosive impact fuses
plane-crazy 2019-11-05 17:46:24 suspension based impact explosive system
plane-crazy 2019-11-05 17:45:58 suspension settings

plane-crazy 2019-11-05 17:42:23 haha
plane-crazy 2019-11-05 17:42:21 I did it
plane-crazy 2019-11-05 17:06:29 alternatively just dont use impact fuses,,
plane-crazy 2019-11-05 17:06:20 somehow a suspension presses against target, and also presses against the explosive and guarantees detonation
plane-crazy 2019-11-05 17:05:59 mechanical impact fuse
plane-crazy 2019-11-05 17:05:51 consider the following:

plane-crazy 2019-10-30 12:47:12 like it's either gonna be a launch platform or an aircraft
plane-crazy 2019-10-30 12:46:55 To be fair though mouse guided is arguably easier to destroy the source of
plane-crazy 2019-10-30 12:45:42 mouse-guided or camera-guided missiles are the way to go for Ship-to-Air missiles
plane-crazy 2019-10-29 23:05:29 payed social credit

plane-crazy 2019-10-28 16:43:30 can't zoom in on it though
plane-crazy 2019-10-28 16:43:10 It's so low res

plane-crazy 2019-10-19 23:57:52 Same for the ww2 Finnish armoured insignia
plane-crazy 2019-10-19 23:57:42 Out of curiosity are Finnish Airforce ww2 roundels, which are flat blue swastikas, allowed?
plane-crazy 2019-10-19 23:56:49 Lmao
plane-crazy 2019-10-19 23:55:55 Lots of aircraft carrier concepts too
plane-crazy 2019-10-19 23:55:42 French cruiser submarine
plane-crazy 2019-10-19 23:55:36 French aircraft carrier from ww2
plane-crazy 2019-10-19 23:55:29 there's a few ships that are pretty interesting and I'm surprised noone makes
plane-crazy 2019-10-19 21:56:19 It would have like 0 lag unless you're literally running a potato
plane-crazy 2019-10-19 21:56:10 Smoothterrain has a render distance based on graphics anyway
plane-crazy 2019-10-19 21:56:00 I've got a hydrofoil that goes 175 speed and no ocean to do it in.
plane-crazy 2019-10-19 21:55:39 we all do
plane-crazy 2019-10-19 21:55:38 I want a bigger map
plane-crazy 2019-10-19 11:19:07 brt
plane-crazy 2019-10-18 16:28:47 But I save the next one to slot 5 and it deletes itself again!
plane-crazy 2019-10-18 16:28:36 i thought "Oh slot 21 is just weird huh"
plane-crazy 2019-10-18 16:28:27 I've made a battlebot and then I had to make it again since the original deleted itself
plane-crazy 2019-10-18 16:28:03 Why the fuck does my battlebot keep deleting itself
plane-crazy 2019-10-18 15:30:51 whats the size limit for battlebots
plane-crazy 2019-10-18 15:23:05 excellent
plane-crazy 2019-10-18 15:22:57 when is the battlebots starting
plane-crazy 2019-10-16 22:26:07 purified please what the hell did you fill your ship with

plane-crazy 2019-10-14 22:36:39 Jets are heavy but small jets are ok for small craft
plane-crazy 2019-10-14 22:36:05 Those aren't fumes
plane-crazy 2019-10-14 22:35:39 You need speed ghostly
plane-crazy 2019-10-14 22:35:21 >limit thrust with props
That adds *more* weight to a problem I can solve with just jets
plane-crazy 2019-10-14 22:34:49 jets are also a solid OK for certain intakes
plane-crazy 2019-10-14 22:34:23 Mainly because rockets were too much thrust lol
plane-crazy 2019-10-14 22:34:12 Nah I like em for my tiny mig 29
plane-crazy 2019-10-14 22:33:51 And small phalanx domes
plane-crazy 2019-10-14 22:33:45 Good for the end of gun barrels
plane-crazy 2019-10-14 22:33:10 Jets don't give a shitty trail  <@185912072658223104>
plane-crazy 2019-10-14 22:32:36 God I hate rocket trails
plane-crazy 2019-10-14 22:31:56 Agreed
plane-crazy 2019-10-14 22:31:14 That thing must be loud
plane-crazy 2019-10-14 22:31:10 >not using jet engines on a jet
plane-crazy 2019-10-14 22:30:49 Wtf did you put in it
plane-crazy 2019-10-14 22:30:30 you'd better 🔫
plane-crazy 2019-10-14 22:30:16 Would be better with some motorised control surfaces though
plane-crazy 2019-10-14 22:29:45 That's hot
plane-crazy 2019-10-14 19:50:11 what ship is htat

plane-crazy 2019-10-14 18:10:05 it's only on contact and at decent speed
plane-crazy 2019-10-14 18:10:01 I think they're fine

plane-crazy 2019-10-11 14:53:58 please explain to me what the hell that conveyor system is
plane-crazy 2019-10-11 14:53:32 it de-pixelated itself
plane-crazy 2019-10-11 14:53:24 holy shit mindustry
plane-crazy 2019-10-11 00:55:35 If you're going for authenticity I'd say leave space in the cockpit for a tail gunner
plane-crazy 2019-10-11 00:55:09 Decent
plane-crazy 2019-10-10 23:55:02 WoT is too arcadey for me
plane-crazy 2019-10-10 19:17:16 how wide is that bruhmarine
plane-crazy 2019-10-10 18:14:48 You get it free if you nitro boost iirc
plane-crazy 2019-10-10 18:13:52 what's a snow rocket

plane-crazy 2019-10-09 18:12:55 um
plane-crazy 2019-10-09 00:32:06 "mystery"
plane-crazy 2019-10-09 00:32:00 Why would you spoil the mystery :(
plane-crazy 2019-10-08 23:28:43 purif does that walk
plane-crazy 2019-10-08 19:07:59 Dazzle looks a bit funky on plane crazy ships tbh
plane-crazy 2019-10-08 19:07:44 nice purified
plane-crazy 2019-10-08 16:19:39 smooth suspension <:thchoink:527880803456122891>
plane-crazy 2019-10-07 22:03:01 Cockpit size isn't great for actually fitting someone in it
plane-crazy 2019-10-07 21:58:18 Not a great grenade huh
plane-crazy 2019-10-07 20:40:48 i enjoy
plane-crazy 2019-10-07 20:40:47 not necessarily an authentic gustav but it's cool
plane-crazy 2019-10-07 20:38:05 someone made a decent schwerer gustav
plane-crazy 2019-10-07 20:37:39 ***who makes good stukas
plane-crazy 2019-10-07 20:37:28 many many people
plane-crazy 2019-10-07 20:37:26 many people
plane-crazy 2019-10-07 20:37:09 so do trains
plane-crazy 2019-10-07 20:36:54 my suggested whistles could be used on planes
plane-crazy 2019-10-07 20:36:44 JT's don't work on *any* plane
plane-crazy 2019-10-07 20:36:26 JT's are exclusively used for stukas
plane-crazy 2019-10-07 20:36:13 no, a whistle
plane-crazy 2019-10-07 20:36:09 so if you go really fast you make a cool noise
plane-crazy 2019-10-07 20:36:00 the whistle suggestion i made would have an adjustable pitch and volume would be dependent on speed
plane-crazy 2019-10-07 20:35:30 we know what jericho trumpets are
plane-crazy 2019-10-07 20:35:26 propeller implies propulsion
plane-crazy 2019-10-07 20:35:18 "turbine"
a wacky unpowered fan
plane-crazy 2019-10-07 20:35:07 a whistle is a whistle
plane-crazy 2019-10-07 20:35:03 Jericho Trumpets are turbines designed to spin in a way that they produce the sound of the Jericho Trumpet
plane-crazy 2019-10-07 20:34:51 no they're not
plane-crazy 2019-10-07 20:34:45 whistles can be used for trains *and* planes
plane-crazy 2019-10-07 20:34:35 jericho trumpets bad
plane-crazy 2019-10-07 20:34:30 whistles good
plane-crazy 2019-10-07 20:33:56 i've suggested this before
plane-crazy 2019-10-07 20:33:54 that have an adjustable pitch
plane-crazy 2019-10-07 20:33:49 literally just speed-sensitive whistles tbh
plane-crazy 2019-10-07 20:33:37 yes we know what jericho trumpets are put onto
plane-crazy 2019-10-07 20:33:23 not jericho trumpets but speed-activated whistles with an adjustable pitch would be cool
plane-crazy 2019-10-07 20:33:12 >jericho trumpets, says the user with a waffen ss helmet in his pfp
plane-crazy 2019-10-06 20:28:58 vr can take screenshots

plane-crazy 2019-10-05 16:42:18 Rockets do create an ugly trail

plane-crazy 2019-10-04 21:44:41 ki 200
plane-crazy 2019-10-04 20:09:34 I plan on making a less known plane that is absolutely colossal
plane-crazy 2019-10-04 20:09:21 with funky music over the top
plane-crazy 2019-10-04 20:09:13 they're just anchored in a pattern
plane-crazy 2019-10-04 20:09:10 yeah but those arent even flying in formation
plane-crazy 2019-10-04 20:07:23 and none of them a b29
plane-crazy 2019-10-04 20:07:18 so many large planes

plane-crazy 2019-10-04 19:40:54 wrong grey tbh too
plane-crazy 2019-10-04 19:40:40 That's such an obnoxiously bright red for under the waterline

plane-crazy 2019-10-02 19:53:58 it doesnt look a lot like a b29 but it's got the main features i guess
plane-crazy 2019-10-02 19:53:27 I'll cesna you in a minute
plane-crazy 2019-10-02 19:52:38 this looks like a job for a b-29

plane-crazy 2019-09-29 00:03:29 Some fecker in <#537387160261885962> made their USS freedom even blocks wide
plane-crazy 2019-09-29 00:02:30 it's going to stab me
plane-crazy 2019-09-29 00:02:04 It's chonk
plane-crazy 2019-09-29 00:02:00 Everything on it is bad
plane-crazy 2019-09-29 00:01:44 I see why it was downvoted
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 23:59:21 barely anyone liked my tiny harrier :(
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 23:59:07 My creations either get decent upvotes or a pocket of downvotes
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 23:58:43 also a heretic

plane-crazy 2019-09-28 23:55:29 also Die Glocke
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 23:55:22 I could make haunebu

plane-crazy 2019-09-28 23:48:18 Except I can't box fold so the scale to was way off
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 23:48:00 lmao me too
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 23:47:45 Darkz did you try to make the graf
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 23:41:54 It should be noted at least 30 people disagree with you
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 23:41:00 The plane still has to fly
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 23:40:52 It's not removing difficulty it's adding convenience
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 23:40:38 its not removing the ability to keep it "difficult"
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 23:40:10 But it shouldn't be harder
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 23:39:44 its a common problem for my aircraft where I can't fit landing gear in without making the plane look disgusting
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 23:39:18 Or airdropping a ship
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 23:39:12 It'd be especially nice for testing gliders and stuff that attach to other people's plane
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 23:38:37 Sure it spawns you in the air but you still then have to not fall out of the sky
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 23:37:46 It's a quality of life thing
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 23:37:38 Especially with aircraft that can't take off until the end of the baseplate
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 23:37:25 Ok great but some people don't like the annoyance of taking off
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 23:28:59 <@339519624968404993> why downvote air spawn
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 19:18:00 Tge tyrret was originally going to be put on the luchs but it was considered too expensive so they changed the turret entirely
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 19:17:39 It's not a luchs turret
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 16:23:41 that too
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 16:23:15 needs more hangar lenght

plane-crazy 2019-09-27 14:24:10 if i used actual propeller engines it'd look dumb
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 14:23:55 how would I make them thinner
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 14:22:26 wdym fix it
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 14:22:12 how does this (unpainted) b29 look
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 14:19:45 chonkkk
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 23:12:15 Better pontoons than pontoons I mean
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 23:11:57 Ballast tanks are cooler pontoons
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 20:38:27 i want bigger ocean
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 20:38:21 in the water it goes 95
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 20:38:17 my hydrofoil can get to 150 sps when hydrofoiling
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 20:37:21 there's not enough ocean to hydrofoil properly
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 20:36:14 large hydrofoils are a pain in the ass lol
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 20:36:03 centre of mass that's why
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 20:35:42 why

plane-crazy 2019-09-25 16:58:28 ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
plane-crazy 2019-09-25 16:58:25 they're heavier though so
plane-crazy 2019-09-25 16:58:22 Yeah
plane-crazy 2019-09-25 16:56:33 they probably work better on a lighter craft
plane-crazy 2019-09-25 16:56:13 Im pretty sure they work
plane-crazy 2019-09-25 16:56:02 my Pegasus goes 95 in the water and 135 while hydrofoiling

plane-crazy 2019-09-24 23:27:03 Suspension is included when speaking about tracks
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 23:26:37 Those are nice ass tracks
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 22:49:10 What
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 22:43:22 Not going for inventor, just curious
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 22:43:13 how many revolvers with a reloading system have been made
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 17:51:42 pick better colours

plane-crazy 2019-09-23 19:22:32 imagine not being in 126tank ps
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 14:51:26 on my USS Somers they were painful
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 14:51:20 Nah I've had motor problems before
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 14:51:06 mainly misfiring pistons
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 14:50:59 I haven't had many problems with motors recently tbh
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 14:50:26 also ftd costs money
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 14:49:53 ftd seems interesting but 2 complex for me
plane-crazy 2019-09-22 23:08:08 <@238017332872478720> what did you get shipwright with
plane-crazy 2019-09-22 23:07:47 And inverted does exactly what it says on the tin
plane-crazy 2019-09-22 23:07:31 Toggle is whether pushing it once makes it stay at max angle or doesn't
plane-crazy 2019-09-22 23:07:05 Ok servo means holding down button will make it move to max angle forwards or backwards
plane-crazy 2019-09-22 23:06:45 Motor 2's are great for custom control surfaces
plane-crazy 2019-09-22 23:06:20 Like ass
plane-crazy 2019-09-22 23:06:07 Soviets bad
plane-crazy 2019-09-22 23:06:02 sepecat jaguar good

plane-crazy 2019-09-20 21:47:30 <@!221487880487436288> If you want logn range sniping go upvote my post on a pvp overhaul to add actual artillery guns for tanks and ships
plane-crazy 2019-09-20 21:43:43 and they're huge
plane-crazy 2019-09-20 21:43:20 magnet guns are not effective anti air weapons >:(
plane-crazy 2019-09-20 21:43:00 can't make my own mg's
plane-crazy 2019-09-20 21:42:38 fuckin "hmm today I will fire a glorified mechanical slingshot"
plane-crazy 2019-09-20 21:42:28 it's so frustrating to deal with
plane-crazy 2019-09-20 21:42:23 bulletdrop sucks in pvp
plane-crazy 2019-09-20 21:42:16 <@456226577798135808> lmao why'd you downvote my suggestion to reduce bulletdrop
plane-crazy 2019-09-20 15:32:46 oh god oh fuck
plane-crazy 2019-09-16 06:49:59 Pak bus
plane-crazy 2019-09-15 12:03:08 how does the door work
plane-crazy 2019-09-15 12:02:57 that unsettles me
plane-crazy 2019-09-15 11:59:51 idk
plane-crazy 2019-09-15 11:59:51 maybe?
plane-crazy 2019-09-15 11:59:24 ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
plane-crazy 2019-09-15 11:59:23 there's cameras on the ends of the missiles so
plane-crazy 2019-09-15 11:59:16 It's so I can tell what missile I'm at when firing
plane-crazy 2019-09-15 11:57:51 fear me

plane-crazy 2019-09-13 23:21:16 not size accurate though which makes it shiny
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 18:23:05 it's so big uwu
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 18:22:02 absolutely magnum
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 18:21:55 the guided missile in <#537387160261885962> kinda sucks
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:53:40 wtf
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:53:40 what's a cool way to use a smoke pipe
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:52:29 hm yes great
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:52:14 out of curiosity how many server moderators are there
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:50:55 90's civilian aircraft
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:50:40 30's civilian vessels
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:50:29 ww1 aircraft
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:46:53 because apparently it's a vote thing
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:46:46 I'll wait for the opinions of other mods too
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:46:36 alright
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:46:16 I asked orange
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:46:09 is this worthy of inventor
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:46:08 https://gyazo.com/154ab6a545e2919a8e7f9ef36b80c106
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:46:05 while you're here
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:46:02 Yknow what Organeskii
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:45:21 :^)
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:45:20 the ring pole mechanism is original
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:45:01 hey guys guess what
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:44:27 you will be upgraded
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:44:18 replication is good
all will be assimilated into the borg
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:43:56 what is it
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:43:55 without insulting the server
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:43:39 *supposed* to be
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:43:38 what's it supposed to be
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:43:35 Ok but actually
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:43:23 whats pccgcs
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:42:03 uraaaa
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:42:02 all created equal
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:41:59 establish communism
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:41:51 the godhood pyramid
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:41:19 quirky
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:40:41 what is vip general
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:40:22 Maybe you should fix that
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:40:02 if determining inventor rank was restricted to a vote amongst just the inventors it becomes a "we're special you're not" clique
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:39:32 way to start a popularity contest
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:39:15 that's just dumb
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:39:12 "no we wont let you into the inventor group you're not one of us"
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:39:05 That makes it into a clique
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:38:44 I have yet to see another ring/hoop mechanism
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:38:26 I have yet to see that yielding
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:38:10 everything can be downgraded to basics
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:38:05 all the suspension is just motors and blocks and ropes
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:37:59 And?
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:37:48 I'm trying to help you understand
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:37:43 I'm not trying to make you feel guilty
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:37:24 this isn't a difficult problem
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:37:15 MrEpic I literally think you should get inventor for your actual navigation instrument
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:36:47 apparently 2 people have gotten inventor for suspension which, serves the same purpose and use different execution
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:36:35 You've all made the same points and I've kept having to repeat myself
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:36:20 Well no
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:36:05 so far noones really been able to give a valid point as to why I shouldnt get my epic pixels on a screen
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:35:03 that's the nicest thing someone's said all day thanks lilundr
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:34:34 that's a threat you probably shouldnt make
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:33:59 I'm relatively active
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:33:33 yielding you're not staff
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:33:19 So inventor can no longer be gotten then?
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:32:48 lilundr we went over this
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:32:42 because I want my wacky pixels on a screen they make me feel good
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:32:26 And yet it fulfills all 1 requirement of inventor
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:32:12 yielding do you possess the ability to not be passive aggressive
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:31:31 who the hell is xoot
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:31:18 no i'm not fuckin xoot
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:31:10 there's a k in there
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:30:40 same purpose different method lilundr
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:30:32 Yup
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:30:07 how many inventors have gotten inventor for suspension
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:30:01 I'll ask the question again
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:29:48 And therefore you're wrong head and ass
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:29:37 that is not the same method
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:29:35 I said with the same method
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:29:03 that seems counterproductive given another unmentioned rule is that the invention is useful
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:28:52 Why would you want to make your mechanism more complex
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:28:25 show me where someone has used the same method
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:28:20 then prove it
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:28:16 and yet they've never been able to properly prove that
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:28:11 Yknow people keep saying it's been made before
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:27:59 How many inventors have gotten inventor for suspension
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:27:36 Same purpose different execution is still unique
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:26:49 no?
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:26:34 just perhaps??????
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:26:22 maybe if you took a couple minutes away from the computer you wouldn't be as annoyed????
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:25:40 well you proved that one wrong
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:25:00 you are the reason you are annoyed
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:24:29 that's a long post for somethign you didnt have to get involved in
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:23:06 and you say *I* have no common sense
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:22:58 "hmm this person is annoying me
I know I'll stay in the same place"
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:22:40 then take a step away from the pc for a bit
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:21:40 "oh he deleted it"
"oh i'm not scrolling back to january"
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:21:34 it's always been wacky conveniences
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:21:21 and get the evidence
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:21:18 and noones been able to go
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:21:15 You keep saying that
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:20:56 still havent proved the same method hasnt been done before
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:20:47 wow epic very nicely done
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:20:10 wow that sure is convenient
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:19:58 why is this surprising to you yielding
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:19:53 If you can't prove your point then your point doesnt work does it
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:19:34 Can you prove that?
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:19:15 same purpose with different execution is still unique
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:19:06 I will reiterate  for the fourth ish time
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:18:35 and yet you resort to "hm i question this person's age"
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:18:09 because you're unable to make a point
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:17:45 ok,
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:17:35 >hm i am losing
>time to guess age???????
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:16:46 you are the head and ass
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:16:41 the same purpose with a different execution is still unique
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:16:30 It hasnt been made though but ok lmao
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:15:10 that's not how the common sense rule works
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:14:25 sucks for you then huh
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:14:17 instead of having a hissy fit over someone "not understanding"
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:14:09 Maybe change the rank requirements for inventor then
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:13:56 hmmm i wonder
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:13:55 why not just use the game-given suspension
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:13:48 And yet wacky suspension does
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:13:31 A PENCIL IS NOT A PEN THEY BOTH WRITE
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:13:26 THE SAME PURPOSE WITH A DIFFERENT EXECUTION IS STILL UNIQUE
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:13:04 NO IT HASNT
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:12:57 "hur dur too simple" my ass
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:12:55 not my fault you've failed to mention other requirements
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:12:48 again I will reiterate the official rank requirements
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:12:36 that's not a valid point
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:12:32 It's not
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:12:10 "it's too simple reeee"
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:12:04 but maybe dont pull bs out of your ass to avoid giving it
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:11:53 I get it's supposed to be a rare rank
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:11:20 if he's made an actual navigation instrument
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:11:14 I think MrEpic should get his inventor too
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:11:06 I agree it is bullshit that I've fulfilled the rank requirements and I've got nothing for it
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:10:24 you do not have a point to make here
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:10:19 and i'm using a different style for my arrestor wire
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:09:52 but so does every single suspension
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:09:49 Sure they serve the same purpose
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:09:40 then I'll bugger off
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:09:37 Find another mechanism that has used a ring and pole
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:09:23 that's a different mechanism
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:09:05 but you've not proven that
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:08:26 you can't act like i'm some sort of wacky annoyance here when you're not giving any points
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:08:13 "hur dur it just rope and ring" and???? the suspension that has gotten people inventor has just been motors and ropes
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:07:51 no duh I won't accept defeat you guys haven't proven anything
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:07:43 Noone has been able to provide proof for that though fonkl
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:07:26 these are the only requirements listed
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:07:23 
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:07:21 Superidra it literally
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:06:58 why are you so annoyed over it mrepic
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:05:31 <@!327499289595084800> so prove it can work on other aircraft?
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:03:39 You want me to make my submarine fly and catch the ring or something?
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:03:09 a sextant is a navigation instrument
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:02:48 I would hope that admins are reasonable in what they approve and do not approve
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:02:31 nothing about "no using few block types"
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:02:23 nothing about "has to be complex"
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:02:12 nothing else is listed
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:02:08 these are the official requirements listed in <#609442446249820211>
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:01:47 what's your point
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:01:46 and the quirky suspension that gets people inventor is just motors and ropes
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:00:53 no other hoop-and-pole mechanism
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:00:44 the only actual arresting wire that apparently worked was a beam and ropes
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:00:15 oh also i looked up some arresting cables in <#384025409945337856>
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 18:58:16 bruh why the engines on the tail so high
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 18:48:39 doubt but ok
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 18:48:26 bugger off it should be obvious
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 18:48:17 It should be approved
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 18:48:10 Based on the requirements for the rank
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 18:47:46 the rank doesn't say it has to be overtly complex
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 18:47:33 sorry I've made a decent and useful thing that doesn't need 200 parts to begin to function
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 18:47:08 Noone has been able to prove otherwise
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 18:47:01 It's a unique useful mechanism
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 18:46:55 But it's unique
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 18:46:40 isn't an unmentioned requirement that it's useful
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 18:46:31 which is ultimately the goal, surely
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 18:46:21 means it has more usability by others as opposed to 80 motor suspension
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 18:46:05 Ive created an apparently unique mechanism that isn't difficult to replicate for others
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 18:45:46 Surely the simplicity means its better
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 18:45:07 <@339519624968404993> when was it built before, by who, and can you show me
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 18:42:29 just because its not another suspension system smh smh
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 18:42:16 you haven't even seen it
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 18:41:46 so when do I get inventor <:WhatWasThat:525319504721608705> <:WhatWasThat:525319504721608705>
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 17:51:46 <@238017332872478720>
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 17:51:35 if it's got a stick on it, the mechanism will work for it
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 17:51:22 as opposed to say a suspension that only works within xyz parameters
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 17:50:59 surely the more universal and usable the creation is, the better
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 17:50:24 a creation being able to function no matter where the catcher pole is would surely be a good point
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 17:49:22 not really
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 17:48:47 as long as it can catch the ring
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 17:48:41 on the wing, on the nose, under the belly
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 17:48:21 and the best part is that you could really put the pole anywhere imo
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 17:47:59 My rig should work as long as the pole is attached in some way
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 17:45:21 as opposed to chad doughnut
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 17:45:02 yeah ropes smell and kinda suck at catching a plane
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 17:44:28 thank u
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 17:44:25 there is but noones provided it
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 17:44:07 so there's no real way to tell if it even exists
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 17:43:39 no scrolling needed
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 17:43:30 bro just do before: xyz in the creations channel
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 17:43:07 so if I have made it work am I still worthy
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 17:42:54 attempted u say
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 17:42:43 show me
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 17:42:31 So idk

plane-crazy 2019-08-10 00:13:36 no they're just not good particles to look at
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 00:12:51 give smoke emitters
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 00:12:44 rocket engine particles suck and they exert force on a creation
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 00:12:29 Be the change you want to see headasses
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 00:11:41 drama implies it's worth anyone's time
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 00:11:33 not even drama
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 00:10:58 now you sound like a boomer reiiign
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 00:09:52 Oh *im* doctor negativity
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 00:09:14 Who are you to determine "ooer these replica guys are so unoriginal arg"
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 00:08:50 Who are you to determine how much effort is put in
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 00:08:12 Super is literally a boomer
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 00:06:44 are there techniques
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 00:05:38 boomers suck
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 00:05:34 yea
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 00:05:22 you sound like a boomer
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 00:04:47 so probably not the first
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 00:04:41 in literal terms
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 00:04:36 isn't a plane a flying machine
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 00:03:30 hence people making replicas and people making fictional stuff
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 00:03:11 it'd be boring if everyone did the same thing
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 00:02:59 super people can enjoy different things to you
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 00:02:46 juicy swept wing
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 00:02:03 Super you are complaining that people enjoy things
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 00:01:42 replicas are hard to emulate for scale yeah
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 00:01:29 super your best example of a ship is worse than the tiny yamato from the other day
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 00:00:44 it's not that deep
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 00:00:37 "unga bunga replicas are for lazy people" fuck you it's because the thing I'm replicating is cool and I want to walk around on it in a digital lego game
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 00:00:03 no I just want to make a somers because it looks cool headass
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 23:59:15 not that the bow is anything special kek
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 23:59:03 Probably upvoted the physicals rather than visuals
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 23:57:54 "unga bunga purple and green"
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 23:57:24 bro imagine not understanding colours and what's actually nice to look at
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 23:56:50 Relieve your stress with some normal colours
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 23:56:37 you seem aggressive
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 23:56:12 better than Purple and green
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 23:56:00 it's effective
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 23:55:57 yes
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 23:55:49 Try battleship grey
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 23:55:35 Not purple and green
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 23:55:15 Your colours suck
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 23:54:56 oh no not his industrial command ship
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 23:54:37 looks like a wooden board with two mosaics taped on

plane-crazy 2019-08-09 23:52:09 like my graf doesn't have a lot but it's decent

plane-crazy 2019-07-31 19:29:05 nice
plane-crazy 2019-07-31 19:28:41 could be used for engines, floors, etc
plane-crazy 2019-07-31 19:28:35 and pretty thin
plane-crazy 2019-07-31 19:28:32 this as 1 block
plane-crazy 2019-07-31 19:28:16 like a grate
plane-crazy 2019-07-31 19:28:03 a sort of criss-cross block would be neat
plane-crazy 2019-07-31 19:26:35 those owuld be good shapes
plane-crazy 2019-07-31 19:26:28 and this
plane-crazy 2019-07-31 19:26:23 this
plane-crazy 2019-07-31 19:25:33 again, rounded and pointed versions would be cool
plane-crazy 2019-07-31 19:25:08 bruh
plane-crazy 2019-07-31 19:24:43 i think a rounded and a more pointed version would be cool
plane-crazy 2019-07-31 19:24:09 THAT's HOT
plane-crazy 2019-07-31 19:24:05 that's hot
plane-crazy 2019-07-31 19:24:00 i witnessed sin
plane-crazy 2019-07-31 15:28:52 tf is up with it's rudder
plane-crazy 2019-07-31 15:23:56 those propeller engines look kinda funky
plane-crazy 2019-07-31 15:22:46 you dont
plane-crazy 2019-07-31 15:22:42 lmao
plane-crazy 2019-07-31 02:48:50 wings being able to glide shouldn't be intensive at all especially not on Roblox
plane-crazy 2019-07-31 02:48:30 that shouldn't be cpu intensive
plane-crazy 2019-07-31 02:48:09 How would that cause lag
plane-crazy 2019-07-30 22:37:32 They look like nerf darts I love them
plane-crazy 2019-07-30 20:34:59 holy shet

plane-crazy 2019-07-28 15:52:19 there is nothing more cursed than an upside down rope elevator
plane-crazy 2019-07-28 15:31:16 i have escaped from loser suspension with francais tank
plane-crazy 2019-07-28 15:19:09 !servers
plane-crazy 2019-07-26 16:48:28 I managed to add a part to my tank's rollers to keep the track on but they look like spiders or something lol
plane-crazy 2019-07-26 14:18:08 hey guys what's boppin
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 20:32:03 and noone can stop me
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 20:32:01 i made polish wunderwaffe
plane-crazy 2019-07-23 01:41:04 I can see at least 2 useless motors
plane-crazy 2019-07-23 01:40:44 Wouldn't solid blocks make it more stable rather than extra motors
plane-crazy 2019-07-23 01:40:13 Why so many motors
plane-crazy 2019-07-23 01:39:53 Love me a dummy thicc Walker
plane-crazy 2019-07-23 01:37:37 Yeah but it's not meme camo where you go "bro where are your legs haha"
plane-crazy 2019-07-23 01:37:17 not meme camouflage at least
plane-crazy 2019-07-23 01:37:05 It's not even camouflage bros
plane-crazy 2019-07-23 01:36:34 Overall it's a nice design but I don't see a practical use for the plow at the front
plane-crazy 2019-07-23 01:36:13 I didn't say the result was bad jusr a wacky encounter
plane-crazy 2019-07-23 01:35:41 It looks like a leopard 2 had a bad meeting with a Chisel
plane-crazy 2019-07-23 01:35:17 Man I wish there was a high blast pressure no damage explosive to use as primer for a shell
plane-crazy 2019-07-23 01:34:15 1k studs per second sounds unlikely what sort of firing mechanism are you using
plane-crazy 2019-07-23 01:33:55 and also yea is it faster than a normal round that doesnt have the casing
plane-crazy 2019-07-23 01:33:29 show, noc
plane-crazy 2019-07-23 01:33:14 I want to know if it works ingame and you don't have the answer for that
plane-crazy 2019-07-23 01:32:56 I didn't ask you
plane-crazy 2019-07-23 01:32:28 I meant ingame
plane-crazy 2019-07-23 01:32:24 I don't want the math I know how a sabot works dingus
plane-crazy 2019-07-23 01:31:58 My question is: can it fire and does the detaching of the casing actually help like in real life
plane-crazy 2019-07-23 01:31:32 They're like wacky pods
plane-crazy 2019-07-23 01:31:22 Not just a ring
plane-crazy 2019-07-23 01:31:16 Sabots are full casings
plane-crazy 2019-07-23 01:31:04 That's not a sabot
plane-crazy 2019-07-23 01:30:51 It's not like you can make an effective primer
plane-crazy 2019-07-23 01:30:41 I feel like the hardest part would be making a decent firing mechanism
plane-crazy 2019-07-23 01:30:17 Is a sabot that difficult though
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 10:35:45 ✨ roblox ✨
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 10:31:25 i wish the mg's looked better to put on a vehicle
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 10:31:13 it's not a meaningful difference
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 10:31:09 but like
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 10:31:08 depending on whether or not your turret has armour or not
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 10:30:57 i mean it *kinda does*
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 10:26:53 'hackers'
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 10:26:51 well
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 10:26:48 phantom forces is either actual hackers or kids saying you're a hacker
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 15:59:43 that and updates if they decide to appear any time soon
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 15:59:14 yeah because that's what interests me the most
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 15:59:00 hello
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 15:58:48 decid u sound like a loser rn
plane-crazy 2019-07-06 17:14:10 as opposed to a dedicated 0.5 pillar
plane-crazy 2019-07-06 17:14:05 you get 2 centered pillars before they look stupid
plane-crazy 2019-07-06 17:13:30 also disconnectors can only do 2 blocks before looking stupid
plane-crazy 2019-07-06 17:13:24 what if i dont want to set up unused hotkeys just to have nice looking pillars
plane-crazy 2019-07-06 17:12:58 centred 0.5 blocks would be neat
plane-crazy 2019-07-06 17:12:39 i cant see a use for htem
plane-crazy 2019-07-03 20:58:41 i really want to make a new carrier but i dont know what to base it off so i might just end up making one loosely based on the Graf again lol
plane-crazy 2019-07-01 15:26:07 feck
plane-crazy 2019-07-01 15:25:47 how do people get their ship turrets so flush with the body
plane-crazy 2019-06-29 21:26:31 the shape
plane-crazy 2019-06-29 21:26:30 yeah obviously but like
plane-crazy 2019-06-29 21:25:04 i forget
plane-crazy 2019-06-29 21:25:03 how do you do a 3x3 prop engine
plane-crazy 2019-06-29 21:24:18 propeller engine design struggles
plane-crazy 2019-06-29 17:03:27 i'm playing neo
plane-crazy 2019-06-29 17:03:25 no
plane-crazy 2019-06-29 14:54:34 it's cute
plane-crazy 2019-06-29 14:54:11 it's official server 1 time
plane-crazy 2019-06-29 14:53:11 probably
plane-crazy 2019-06-29 14:48:18 epic

plane-crazy 2019-06-28 22:59:10 whats the difference between a powered disconnector and an unpowered
plane-crazy 2019-06-28 22:56:23 which is annoying because seat
plane-crazy 2019-06-28 22:56:02 looks like a neckbeard
plane-crazy 2019-06-28 22:56:01 it has too much of a chin

plane-crazy 2019-06-28 22:22:13 where's the private server listed
plane-crazy 2019-06-28 22:21:52 there's a VIP server?
plane-crazy 2019-06-28 22:21:48 <@!238017332872478720> what is it's purpose
plane-crazy 2019-06-28 22:01:46 hate to make an essay but
plane-crazy 2019-06-28 22:01:44 i like plane crazy as a game but tbh sometimes creations-chat act like they could do any better given the restrictions of lack of parts or trying to keep to a decently accurate scale
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 21:23:13 f3x can make good things
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 21:23:03 what
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 21:09:57 there's a shoddy turret just hanging out smh
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 20:57:16 mrepic are you in a ps
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 20:56:26 for ultimate folding wing capabilities
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 20:56:22 also wing hinges would be a massive uwu moment
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 20:56:14 i can hope
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 20:56:12 probably not but yknow
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 20:55:41 that would make me happy
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 20:55:36 piston fixes
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 20:54:59 fixed landing gear perhap
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 20:54:55 yuh
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 20:54:40 big uwu moment
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 20:54:39 2x2 and 1x3 control surfaces
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 20:54:08 1/4 blocks for square corners uwu
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 20:53:42 maybe some rivers
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 20:53:36 a bigger ocean would be pretty epic
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 20:53:26 there's a lot you can do currently already
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 20:53:21 i mean what is there left to be added
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 20:53:10 that too
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 20:52:51 i wonder what the next addition to plane crazy will be
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 19:10:16 even has a heli on the back
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 19:10:10 not bad
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 19:07:00 because the ylook attached

plane-crazy 2019-06-27 19:05:56 interesting turret design though
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 19:05:44 >1600 blocks
you are weak
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 18:43:14 what did that create, yousuf
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 18:43:03 magnum carrier
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 18:42:30 decid why did you ask how many blocks my carrier has
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 18:35:09 <@456226577798135808> 3200+
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 18:33:25 im considering adding suicide 109's to my graf zeppelin

plane-crazy 2019-06-25 20:19:49 but yeah does anyone have an opinion
plane-crazy 2019-06-25 20:17:47 alternatively make something that would be useful and benefit the entire community
plane-crazy 2019-06-25 20:17:23 make a child
plane-crazy 2019-06-25 20:16:42 a mini version obviously
plane-crazy 2019-06-25 20:16:31 Should i put an AR234 or a Ho229 on my Graf Zeppelin
