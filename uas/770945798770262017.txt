creations-chat 2022-12-28 03:17:04 I feel that the PC community needs to see something exceptionally good to be able to have a positive opinion on any build

unlike the minecraft community that can appreciate the decent builds and still enjoy the really good builds
creations-chat 2022-12-28 03:19:12 fr
either shit or if its good since you are a white name its a tutorial build üíÄ
creations-chat 2022-12-28 03:22:36 i had an amogus mech that almost got me banned

help 2023-01-07 15:19:58 that's just how motors work. technically motor locking halving the length of the motor is a glitch, fixed by using the motor. the original intention to what motor locking is supposed to do, is not move around when not being used.
