plane-crazy 2020-07-17 22:01:37 WAIT
plane-crazy 2020-07-17 22:01:31 thats rough
plane-crazy 2020-07-17 22:01:27 damn
plane-crazy 2020-07-17 22:01:18 also why do the conyers not paint on one side
plane-crazy 2020-07-17 22:00:47 these two creations are from one file, so if i enter these in will it still count as valid for getting the role
plane-crazy 2020-07-17 21:58:50 so wait if i have a creation made of multiple (two) creations can i still enter it as a creation?
plane-crazy 2020-07-17 21:55:54 boooo
plane-crazy 2020-07-17 21:55:36 ummmm
plane-crazy 2020-07-17 21:55:18 ??????
plane-crazy 2020-07-17 21:54:52 you know its big enough to glitch and lag the game enough to send you flying when you run on it when its moving
plane-crazy 2020-07-17 21:50:42 true idk my rockets sry
plane-crazy 2020-07-17 21:50:25 Saturn rocket?
plane-crazy 2020-07-17 21:50:17 yeah
plane-crazy 2020-07-17 21:50:02 you just gotta try to make the motors blend in as much as possible
plane-crazy 2020-07-17 21:49:32 meaning make then comaflauge with the creations
plane-crazy 2020-07-17 21:49:09 make it so that the motors are as obscure as possible
plane-crazy 2020-07-17 21:48:37 the cam block
plane-crazy 2020-07-17 21:48:07 testing*
plane-crazy 2020-07-17 21:47:59 you could use cameras from the light blub section as for they are invisable when the creation is in tsting
plane-crazy 2020-07-17 19:35:21 but mainly all helis use them
plane-crazy 2020-07-17 19:34:57 they usually use swashplates in single rotor helis
plane-crazy 2020-07-17 19:34:23 blades sorry
plane-crazy 2020-07-17 19:33:59 bi using the rotors and tilting them
plane-crazy 2020-07-17 19:33:41 its what allows a heli to tilt/strafe and go foward and back
plane-crazy 2020-07-17 19:32:57 mainly bc i dont get into helicopters that much
plane-crazy 2020-07-17 19:32:41 i dont even know how to make a swashplate first of all
plane-crazy 2020-07-17 19:32:06 XD
plane-crazy 2020-07-17 19:30:09 bc thats what i did with mine
plane-crazy 2020-07-17 19:29:51 oh well try it with button controls
plane-crazy 2020-07-17 19:28:58 /yes
plane-crazy 2020-07-17 19:27:27 one block inbetween the wings
