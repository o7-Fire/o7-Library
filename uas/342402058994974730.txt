The Tale of FWEBRIGHT (342402058994974730)
bug-reports 2020-05-19 04:04:03 when i press the lock option for the motors and the pistons then when I'm not using them they for some reason have a mind of their own and disconnect from their base therefore being insanely annoying and only when i use them they go back to normal, please fix this and make it so that when you have the lock option on the pistons and the motors don't use glitches to lock in place, because its infuriating. My hovercraft would be perfect if it werent for this glitch.
creations-chat 2020-05-21 04:27:42 Whatcha guys think of my hovercraft?

creations-chat 2020-08-10 10:36:30 never played that game is good?
creations-chat 2020-08-10 10:38:20 sorry to sound rude but that was kinda rude, saying that their low graphics, instead you could of told me how to fix it or maybe just and idea, but that was plainly rude

creations-chat 2020-08-10 10:44:51 see idk how to control the motor lock and also the main thing that i think i got was the fact that the humvee is mostly boxy

bug-reports 2020-08-27 17:52:17 I have the same problem, but to add to the paint tool it wont allow me to select the materials
bug-reports 2020-08-27 17:52:39 it wont even allow me select hide and close
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:06:45 bro the new paint tool glitch sucks
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:07:06 because i was planning on finishing my Research ship today
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:07:26 like this is about what i got so far
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:07:37 
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:08:26 and i was making the mini research sub on the back and now i cant paint it nor can i change certain blocks to glass when needed
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:08:45 <@!353348764280422402> what do you mean better
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:09:11 its not supposed to be
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:09:16 smh
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:09:33 thats the design choice that i went with
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:10:14 and im not spending a whole day to redo the front and the interior inside the front as well
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:11:24 this is the room i would have to redo if i changed the front now <@!353348764280422402>
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:12:18 also i did also take reference off of kAN Gaming
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:12:40 and frantic
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:12:59 yeah
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:13:35 i mean i have a bunch of helium holding my ship up so if you take those out id sink most likely
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:32:43 My phases were
1. stick planes
2. making shity vehicles with a bunch but not spammed rockets and guns
3. making decent builds but never doing planes because i sucked at them
4. still not making planes, but making more detailed creations
5. Made a plane and then stopped and now building pretty decent vehicles and a research ship
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:33:27 so in conclusion I SUCK at making planes
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:34:45 lot of phases my guy
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:37:32 im kinda even to the both of thos
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:37:56 decent at design and decent at function
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:38:14 but not great with either
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:39:59 if the props spin fast enough and have enough span per blade therefore creation more lift horizontally making the plane go faster
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:40:35 so its how you make the propeller engine
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:41:46 well you said they make it slower but somewoman is showing or telling you that there are ways to make it faster
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:43:06 well then why did you respond like you were but you werent because of limitations that somewoman was trying to fix for you
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:43:40 if anything you did this arguement to yourself golly
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:44:32 thats better
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:45:10 i sorta tried doing a motor engine here
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:45:21 its a ultra light
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:45:26 kinda
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:45:36 its not a prop tho i swear
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:46:19 but yeah like i said in my phases I am Trash at planes
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:46:40 XD
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:46:44 /yeah right
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:47:16 you do know EMPs are pulses right
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:47:42 so if its not a electro-magnetic Pulse then its not a EMP
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:48:05 yeah after
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:48:24 i was kinda still typing when you said it
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:48:41 wait i though they could
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:49:01 (notice: I have never experimented with magnets)
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:49:49 like this was the first ever build i had a magnet on and this is about a year ago
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:50:49 for some reason everytime i would connect the crate to the magnet it would glitch out and then weld itself in the air but still on the rope
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:51:28 oh
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:51:40 well i was like 13 back then i didnt know
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:51:49 or 14 something
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:52:16 um bc it didnt really resemble anything
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:52:52 XD
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:53:19 well on my research ship ima have a mini sub on the ack hope that ends well
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:54:05 it might be function wise but where you have function you need some design too
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:54:41 XD
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:54:49 XD
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:54:51 /same
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:55:10 well thats just people being toxic

creations-chat 2020-09-09 22:03:10 <@!498085622649716748> and  <@!628240580517953538> both of you dont know how a droop snoop works, nice builds and all but could it kill you to know your plane?
creations-chat 2020-09-09 22:03:42 XD
creations-chat 2020-09-09 22:03:47 ik the vedeo
creations-chat 2020-09-09 22:03:51 video*
creations-chat 2020-09-09 22:04:37 but yeah the front/cockpit droops down as to allow the pilots to see where they are going while landing in at an angle
creations-chat 2020-09-09 22:05:00 so that means that the only the nose droops is incorrect
help 2020-09-09 22:10:41 how does one change the color of the base in a private server?
help 2020-09-09 22:10:50 is through a command?

creations-chat 2020-09-12 17:37:15 there has been so many in this past month
creations-chat 2020-09-12 17:37:35 thats why im downvoting each and every one that i see now
creations-chat 2020-09-12 22:56:30 <@!577655331229007872> you do know that both of those planes that posted show you know nothing about the droop snoop
creations-chat 2020-09-12 22:57:57 the droop snoop is cockpit mechanism that will fold down/droop the cockpit down so therefore the pilot(s) can see where and what their doing as the land from an angle
creations-chat 2020-09-12 22:59:33 naw ive seen people who know what their doing make one just as good if not better, with the real thing
creations-chat 2020-09-12 22:59:54 and anyways if you cant do it right then dont do it at all
creations-chat 2020-09-12 23:25:42 <@!577655331229007872> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuedQFH8wZI ok tell me what the purpose of the droop snoot is?, because if im not mistaken it literally says that so that the pilot can see while landing the snoot will droop, meaning that yours is in accurate
creations-chat 2020-09-12 23:27:43 yet yours doesnt do that
creations-chat 2020-09-12 23:28:11 yes its apart of it
creations-chat 2020-09-12 23:28:57 ok camin then why add the droop snoot if that a possibility
creations-chat 2020-09-12 23:30:09 yes part of it does tho
creations-chat 2020-09-12 23:31:00 um <@456226577798135808> how does that relate to this conversation
creations-chat 2020-09-12 23:31:59 ok ill admit i was wrng about the cockpit part with the pilots moving was wrong but still there are other things about your plane that is still in accurate
creations-chat 2020-09-12 23:32:38 wow you just keep going dont you
creations-chat 2020-09-12 23:32:49 literally said i was wrong

creations-chat 2020-09-12 23:40:59 and if you can do it with a prop
creations-chat 2020-09-12 23:41:54 i was saying that bc maybe the game wouldnt allow it

<@!595813964726796289> what i mean is that the front lights on the hood are more towards the outer part of the hood, basically maybe space the front lights 1 or 2 more blocks away from the middle of the hood

bug-reports 2020-10-09 22:18:05 Known Bug That Needs To Be Fixed

There is that one and only glitch that ruins almost everyone of my creations and that is the STUPID SERVO, the servo with almost without a doubt will start to bob up and down and then sometimes glitch to the point of where your vehicle is off in the abyss, I hate this glitch as for it ruins many creations that i have made and whenever I try to stop it with sideways pistons it just glitches out more, also if its a Hard code then why not start developing another game with soft code and maybe even allow the old plane crazy to exist so no one loses their stuff, I just can't express how much i HATE the servo

This only happens from what i can tell, when you put a good amount of weight on it, when a piston, motor, or another servo is connected to it either by direct connection or by blocks, or just when it feels like it. Please for the love of god fix this stupid glitch, its been getting on my nerves for years and yet it hasn't been fixed. 

Roblox Name: Slayertazer     Creations: almost every one that includes more than one servo.        not on the test server
bug-reports 2020-10-09 22:24:18 they are the same thing
bug-reports 2020-10-09 22:26:30 they ae literally the same block
bug-reports 2020-10-09 22:27:33 and im pretty sure i said over and over that it was the servo not the default motor 2
creations-chat 2020-10-10 12:32:40 dude you gotta love the toxic people who will dislike your creation even tho they cant build anything better, it sucks when people do that

creations-chat 2020-10-21 21:20:21 <@!732369177368723597> im going to be completely honest to you so no offense, but the reason is because the pictures dont show much, the turrets are low effort, and the only thing funny or interest is that drink stand, that the reason why
creations-chat 2020-10-21 21:22:00 CAN SOMEONE TELL ME WHY THEY INCREASED THE F%#@ING SLOWMODE AGAIN, I remember the good days wen that slowmode didnt exist in this chat

creations-chat 2020-11-17 01:00:15 <@!368581738496131072> Only bad comment I have on your convertible, is the fact that the cover that closes over the gap is lazy, have it actually close and not just spin onto the gap
creations-chat 2020-11-17 01:02:32 I honestly don't understand why my Snow Fox did so well but my hover bike from Colin Furze didnt even tho its quite like the reall thing it was based off just upgraded
creations-chat 2020-11-17 02:22:45 > <@!342402058994974730> wait do you build bikes? Do you have a compact design.. I still am looking for a second vehicle to put in my ratte's vehicle bay..
<@!407347404858458123> yes I have built two hover bikes
creations-chat 2020-11-27 05:52:38 thoughts on my Subnautica Cyclops so far?
creations-chat 2020-11-27 05:54:11 heres a front view too
creations-chat 2020-11-27 05:59:24 the front dome if I were to make it smaller then for some reason it just looks out of place, and I'm basing this off of a 3D model of it so some thing might not always be accurate
But thanks for the feedback
creations-chat 2020-11-27 06:01:26 I'll try to make it smaller when my eyes arent hurting from all the squinting because I can't see what I'm placing on the left side because of the sun glare
creations-chat 2020-11-27 06:03:04 <@!405089963445583881> The main problem I have with it is the fact that the entire wings have slits in them because you didn't make you own custom control surfaces
creations-chat 2020-11-27 06:05:25 other than that I quite like it, so maybe just fix that and you'll have a like from me
creations-chat 2020-11-27 06:07:02 I'm just saying that yes you might sacrifice  your agility but you'll make the plane look better and also so then it doesn't look like a noob built the wings
creations-chat 2020-11-27 06:10:27 bruh
creations-chat 2020-11-28 02:50:59 so what am I to see from this?
creations-chat 2020-11-28 03:13:22 <@456226577798135808> and <@!295784513152221184> , is this dome better?
creations-chat 2020-11-28 03:15:02 thanks
creations-chat 2020-11-28 03:16:34 I was thinking to do that I just thought that would make it longer, so I didn't do I'll try it tho legend
creations-chat 2020-12-03 20:45:07 oh I havent seen shepdog chat in a while
creations-chat 2020-12-03 20:50:53 What do you guys think so far?
creations-chat 2020-12-03 20:53:37 yes that is the front part of the cyclops I hope to make it have a working moon pool and front enter hatch as well
creations-chat 2020-12-06 15:24:31 I mean making a new creation out of an old one is still a new creation no matter how you look at it, such as me updating lets say my S.A.M. turret I made about 3 months ago and posted and made it shoot, that would make it a new creation, sooooooooo
creations-chat 2020-12-06 15:42:05 I mean unless your going for detail then yes
creations-chat 2020-12-06 15:44:08 Btw so far how is my sub I pretty much have the first half of it done, thoughts?
creations-chat 2020-12-06 15:46:30 well tbh Its big as for I want to have a working docking station in it and also a working front hatch to get in on the bottom, and I'm also trying to put as much detail as I possibly can
creations-chat 2020-12-06 15:52:43 <@!559462059251859456> here is this better, btw sorry for the quality I just zoomed in
creations-chat 2020-12-06 15:54:44 Sorry I thought you just needed it zoomed in, my bad.
creations-chat 2020-12-06 15:56:47 And yes that is the starting of the Cyclops mainly bc I recently not to long ago made the snow fox
creations-chat 2020-12-06 15:59:52 and it had quite a good score, so I thought yeah why not, moar subnatica https://discordapp.com/channels/384021699466756103/384025409945337856/778050846578442260
creations-chat 2020-12-06 16:02:32 the millennium  Falcon, however you spell it
creations-chat 2020-12-06 16:12:50 Question what is not similar between the two, th back turrets are a small then big just like yamato, then the cyclinders that havent been painted yet look awfully a lot like the tiny turrets around the superstructure, the front turret setup is the same too, one tiny then two big after, the tower looks similar as well, and the big and small turrets have the same body look, so tell me how that is not supposed to be the yamato, <@!652857275769421825> , I pinged you because I thought you would like to explore these similarities.
creations-chat 2020-12-06 16:17:36 make longer in back
creations-chat 2020-12-06 16:19:39 ok then its good so far gj, Reversing whatcha thing of my message above these pics? <@!652857275769421825>
creations-chat 2020-12-06 16:28:01 an X-wing L0NGTIM3
creations-chat 2020-12-06 16:30:27 <@456226577798135808> what about an Amazon van that transforms into a flying van?
creations-chat 2020-12-06 16:33:03 thats not a transforming van and also its not Amazon, and <@456226577798135808> thats not a plane dude
creations-chat 2020-12-06 16:35:04 yes I mean it transforms like a idk a toy autobot
creations-chat 2020-12-06 16:41:35 not only did he say so far, meaning not done, but also he just needs to change a couple things not the entire thing so lay off dude
creations-chat 2020-12-06 16:44:52 thats way better suggestion than just saying remake it, good job L0NGTIM3
creations-chat 2020-12-06 16:49:11 Yeah but no matter how you put it saying remake it, redo it, restart it, is rude and not helpful to the person who literally asked for help on the what to change and work on, so maybe next do what 1b384bb did and L0NGTIM3, they actually gave a helpful suggestion. yes very, see now he can actually improve on that, instead of being given the vague answer like remake it.
creations-chat 2020-12-06 16:53:54 wow first jet theres no way dude
creations-chat 2020-12-07 18:23:19 <@!695783576549195936> one thing about your bomb maybe try motor locking some bombs and also maybe make the tip dark gray or something, that would make it in my opinion more realistic
creations-chat 2020-12-07 18:34:18 <@!379257519593357313> nice FNAF build bro, really well done
creations-chat 2020-12-07 18:36:20 <@!602626094176141342> tell me how do you make it so you can post a bunch of pic at once instead of all in their own message
creations-chat 2020-12-07 18:42:16 <@!626036997546442763> Thanks dude
creations-chat 2020-12-13 06:14:07 to add the spoiler is wrong, as for the Senna spoiler has Im pretty sure 3 stacks of spoilers that also articulate
creations-chat 2020-12-13 06:26:17 jesus calm down on the suggestions guys, jesus, give the man some space, in all fairness the end result is still quite good, even tho the color doesnt help it
creations-chat 2020-12-13 06:30:56 <@!614659754249420810> , <@!778133713912856586> and <@456226577798135808> what would you want me to improve?
creations-chat 2020-12-13 06:33:57 well the wings i get that but to have it at that scale I cant move them down without showing motors, and then the color scheme is from just cause 3, and the engines are the smallest is can get then so what would you like me to do?
<@!778133713912856586> wow even tho you posted a half done build and got just as many dislikes
creations-chat 2020-12-13 06:37:42 fiser I understand the wings but if i were to either make then steeper or/and lower then either motors would show and I hate that but also the wings wouldnt fit my friends runway, like I said before as well i took the paint job for a game I like its the private het from just cause
creations-chat 2020-12-13 06:39:43 its not 000 black it 12 12 12 dark gray btw
creations-chat 2020-12-13 06:41:56 honestly legend just stop trying bc your input isnt helpful and isnt needed, and also Fiser the only reason I built that thing is for his island and that only so no exception
creations-chat 2020-12-13 06:44:36 Idk how many times I have to say it, like it even says it on the first pic that I purposly made it small so that I can land on my friend's island so no upscale so stop telling me things that are redundant, I dont care of actual runwways
creations-chat 2020-12-13 06:49:42 I know and I'm trying to listen but literally not reading what I literally put in text as for what I did and why I did it pisses me off, bc you dont look at it and then tell me things that dont help but I changed the nose so theres that and tbh its not bad so thanks <@!289930922655088640>
also how would you suggest I put my wings on motor 2s
creations-chat 2020-12-13 06:51:49 I'm open to suggestions that are helpful so <@!289930922655088640>  how do you suggest I add that in with the motor 2s
creations-chat 2020-12-13 06:54:33 wdym and where on it bc the horizontal ones only connection point is on the outside with the cams
creations-chat 2020-12-13 07:04:18 thanks for actually having any kind of constructive criticism, and I'll look into those, but CMD thats fine never said you had too but I just wanted to understand what you meant, so sorry for the misunderstanding. and legend this place is called Creation Feedback meaning you give Feedback to the creations not the messages people send so the emojis arent for here. thats it for now, gonna go to sleep.

bug-reports 2021-01-19 18:33:52 Roblox Name: slayertazer

On Mobile: False

On Test Sever: False

Desc: When a block or player is placed or is later moved onto the conveyors they will not move said object or player and instead the conveyor (if not with an anchor block) will launch into nothingness. 

How To Repeat: Place any conveyor block with the black part facing up, then after setting the controls so that the conveyor will "work", place a free object (something that isn't connected anywhere, but to itself) and then press test and activate the conveyor only to see it not work.

bot-central 2021-02-14 02:39:31 ;;p NEFFEX soldier
creations-chat 2021-02-21 17:05:48 what they mean't from what I can see, is that the sides and roof both are flat and then the back part where it gets skinnier is quite sudden, by that I mean its blocky. Its not bad besides those things, and if it was custom built then that makes it just that much better. maybe you could even call it Luxury Hovmo EL (Luxury HOVer liMO, EL: Extra Long).
creations-chat 2021-02-22 03:46:45 my eyes dude
creations-chat 2021-02-22 03:55:55 tbh I like the fact that your head lights are at an angle, the extra gold pieces that look like secondary mirrors are kinda weird, the stripe on the top kinda looks weird too, and lastly I think what would be nice to ad for the roof so its not so... flat is make the edges rounded and since its a limo add a retractable or even open-able sunroof, you could also tint the windows to almost full black, which has the nickname: LIMO dark window tint, but don't change the tint on the windshield as for that's illegal. 
Also last thing I also make quite a bit of things that aren't military, so I have my fair share of more than just making replicas.
creations-chat 2021-02-22 03:59:42 I like how that dude jamal said that it was to be an A-10 maybe, even tho theres one engine, and its a rocket not jet, and its in the back middle not on the back sides.
creations-chat 2021-02-22 04:02:07 I mean it could be for more than 24 hours, but usually it will be done in less than 12 hours, unless you post it without any support staff online.

creations-chat 2021-03-19 07:08:43 <@!580713604320591873> only problem dude is the slits in the wings
creations-chat 2021-03-19 07:11:32 fix those then you got a up from me, and also by slits I mean using the default control surfaces instead of custom control surfaces to control your plane, bc using the default ones looks stupid, makes it look like a noob made it, and most of all its too basic and dumb.
creations-chat 2021-03-19 16:48:41 <@!320536267987222529> and <@!693059154847203328>, sorry for the late ping, but just out of curiosity what was wrong with my glider that caused you to downvote it, I'd love for your input on how I can make it better as long as they are good requests and not ones that require me to get rid of things that make it work.
creations-chat 2021-03-19 16:50:44 how so? What I mean is how can I make it look good, like any suggestions? <------- <@!693059154847203328>
creations-chat 2021-03-19 16:58:47 what glider because I built it off of a memory from a real glider that I quite loved, so idk what you mean

whats wrong with the wings?
creations-chat 2021-03-19 17:06:16 ok and how can I fix that, because gonna be honest to me it just sounds to me like you just hate competition tbh, that or you have no reason you just downvote builds because you don't care (big for your boots).
creations-chat 2021-03-19 17:09:48 first of all the cabin, do you have any kind of shapes for it, and lastly the back pitch fins are that big to still have really good pitch without the sacrifice of speed
creations-chat 2021-03-19 17:58:20 <@!320536267987222529> is this a bit better now, I tried my best to get rid of the indent in the back, I also closed up some of the holes on the main wings
creations-chat 2021-03-19 18:02:21 I'm sorry for the wings being big but like I said in the thing it is a glider as for its important to achieve as much lift from slow speeds as possible, and the main wings are far forward bc  it allows the front to lift up the most while also bringing the most lift to the heaviest part, and the the wings are so far apart to allow it to be more stable and lighter than if I were to compact them like a jet.

<@!719168864705052802>  and <@!320536267987222529> ^^^^, that is my explanation and like I said before if the suggestion makes the plane less efficient then I'm not going to think about doing it.

creations-chat 2021-04-04 06:41:59 question what exactly am I looking at?
creations-chat 2021-04-04 06:44:37 ok my only thing that I can see right now about the cockpit is that the glass part that is merging with the opaque part is short
creations-chat 2021-04-04 06:49:43 that part in the blue should be a bit longer maybe by lke 1 or 2 blocks
creations-chat 2021-04-08 15:17:45 so going off the engine on the outside of the cyclops would the ring be good for where the propeller is?
creations-chat 2021-04-08 15:19:47 and this is the scale of my cyclops

creations-chat 2021-04-14 15:06:39 <@!720751430595772418> , <@!434286405284397057> , and anyone else, what do you think was wrong with my catamaran, and what can I improved
creations-chat 2021-04-14 15:09:01 what colors would look good to you?, and I'll try to add interior.
creations-chat 2021-04-14 15:11:58 so the red is good, because I really wanted to keep it, but yeah I'll definetly make the white a bit darker and then post the result in here when done
creations-chat 2021-04-14 15:14:00 okay Ill try that thanks for the suggestions and not being those people who just say to rebuild it, okay thanks

creations-chat 2021-04-14 15:16:51 what wood color do you suggest, and also before I think it was <@!701949629708632096> , but how should I fix the sails

creations-chat 2021-04-14 15:20:55 ok I'll do that and then show it here and ping you okay is that okay?
creations-chat 2021-04-14 15:25:47 <@!701949629708632096> are the sails better, and the is this white good, and yes I'll add the red back

creations-chat 2021-04-14 15:40:10 im going to have an oak kinda wood
creations-chat 2021-04-14 15:55:15 not to be rude, but any colors?
creations-chat 2021-04-14 16:26:36 <@!381294057193996290> no WIP in the creations just saying its on the top of the channel
creations-chat 2021-04-14 16:50:57 im just saying that just because their build looks like a tutorial doesn't mean it is, but if it is an exact copy then I would understand

But its not
creations-chat 2021-04-14 16:52:59 the landing gear isnt the same tho
creations-chat 2021-04-14 16:55:13 sorry just saw, like its crazy how alike they are
creations-chat 2021-04-14 16:59:40 <@!701949629708632096>  heres the interior is it good or bad, and the floor is the wood that went with.
creations-chat 2021-04-14 17:01:54 heres the back aswell <@!701949629708632096> , I did the variety of gray and white, https://streamable.com/z6zxhx and the link is a pic of the front. 

it made it a video, XD
creations-chat 2021-04-14 17:04:04 do you think its upvote worthy?
creations-chat 2021-04-14 17:25:19 did you do the shaders in contests? what shaders did you use, and what did they do to your build? <@!523278765825196062>

help 2021-04-16 02:29:09 why wont my control surfaces (default) work woth my mouse
help 2021-04-16 02:37:32 ik that, but thats not my question
help 2021-04-16 02:38:45 I have a crap ton of aero vehicles and other things that dont use the mouse, so this my first time doing it because I need to use it as for its a missle
help 2021-04-16 02:39:20 therefore im not an expert on mouse controlled builds
creations-chat 2021-04-20 16:40:07 add color
creations-chat 2021-04-22 12:18:07 https://streamable.com/8brbea hows this so far, its supposed to be a model train set
creations-chat 2021-04-22 12:21:32 ok heres the thing I'm probably gonna keep them bc not only are they perfect where they are, bc applying power from the body makes the train not able to take corners, and once I make more of a body ima add weight so that I can do it like a toggle
creations-chat 2021-04-22 12:25:37 the weapons, especially the rockets, they have a weird color scheme, and maybe hide the default missles inside the turrets and the custom missles should try to be smaller. The ship however, from the POV at least, looks quite good.

Edit: add some guard rails to the back with some ladders or something.

did you get the idea for building this from Ultimate Driving?
creations-chat 2021-05-24 05:11:00 I feel like this is going in a good direction
creations-chat 2021-05-24 05:13:01 It a WIP version of my cyclops
creations-chat 2021-05-24 05:15:54 thank god I got the shape right and it wasn't just me, I had to redo the F'ing shape 5 times over
creations-chat 2021-05-24 05:20:26 thinking of it now I have to make either the prawn suit or the seamoth for the bay in the cyclops, and I thought this was hard
creations-chat 2021-05-24 05:23:40 is that a dis or complement
creations-chat 2021-05-24 05:27:08 I've always loved the original but gotta say the sub:zero one with the snow fox is awesome
creations-chat 2021-05-24 05:36:12 thanks
creations-chat 2021-05-24 05:44:18 wedge 2, 1x1 wedge block, also I filled the hole in the tail
creations-chat 2021-05-28 03:09:11 I was finally able to get this to work, its sad that it took like a hour or two to do but it looks nice, the prop and back fin I mean
creations-chat 2021-05-28 03:12:03 the pain
creations-chat 2021-05-28 03:15:35 I would honestly say find a common ground, get it as fast as possible, and maybe you could try countering the lift through ballast blocks
creations-chat 2021-05-28 04:13:52 Getting a little high for your horse there, aren't ya. Explains why people jumped on the first mistake you made. Maybe try and not be self-possessed. 
Btw you don't need to be able to motor lock to get an expert rank, take my Expert Shipwright rank, I never used any motor locking to get it.
creations-chat 2021-05-28 05:06:20 Wow, if thats the case then why did you come off as a know it all, also I quite literally put in my explanation as to why people don't need to know what motor locking is to get an expert rank, and if you really want to be rude, then how about ya get an expert rank and then we can talk. By the way I don't like to ping people when they recently talked, because its annoying and unnecessary. By the way using the comeback "I wasn't talking to you" is not only childish, but is also a low effort way of getting the last say. I'm saying this right now I hate cocky, know it all kids.
creations-chat 2021-05-28 05:08:26 If anything that is amazing looking so far, can't wait to see the end result.
creations-chat 2021-05-28 05:10:47 Sorry about that, I just hate it when kids are rude, and act like a know it all.
creations-chat 2021-05-28 05:13:00 I don't think your allowed to posted memes in this channel, that stuff would go in <#495286269459300364>.
creations-chat 2021-05-28 17:10:30 dude is literally digging himself a bigger grave. He changed the caption and claimed it was a crash even though his picture was clearly pointing out the fact of exposed motor-locking, and there's clear photos of what it actually was.
creations-chat 2021-05-28 17:13:36 ikr
creations-chat 2021-05-29 05:08:04 I think this is coming together quite well, next thing to do is bloody paint the thing, such pain.

creations-chat 2021-05-29 05:12:42 damn
creations-chat 2021-05-29 05:18:33 <@!630677812482670623>  sorry for the late ping, but my suggestion to your SCP-173 build is to not only make is darker, but put more detail using motor-locking, and then I'll upvote every picture.

Treefactory1, I agree with him mostly other than the tiles, I think it was creative, I would say keep them, but that's up to you.
creations-chat 2021-05-29 05:22:22 also btw tree those are trails meaning he motor-locked them therefore they're not ladders, and also he does have the shit stains, but not the blood stains, might want to look closer when giving feedback.

the material wouldn't look like blood though, its more shitty looking than dried or reflective

creations-chat 2021-06-02 08:57:35 <@!346438146549874688> need better pictures, only one picture really doesn't show off the creation
creations-chat 2021-06-02 12:10:43 sadly no, as for that would require me to re-scale, and remove the tanks and ballast blocks, but I might make a working docking bay if and when rbk makes the prawn suit.
creations-chat 2021-06-02 12:18:23 Damn, really wish I thought of that, thanks man.
creations-chat 2021-06-02 12:23:19 true, but also I have to re-scale it for to actually look decent, trust me I spent a whole 7-8 hours on trying to make good looking rooms, and it failed miserably, so thats why if and when rbk or someone else makes either the prawn suit or the seamoth I will redo the scale and try interior
creations-chat 2021-06-02 12:25:50 <@!588596347272167456> not trying to be rude or annoying, but could you maybe explain whats wrong with my build.
creations-chat 2021-06-02 12:30:29 Okay, about the white, it is from a color pallet from unknownworlds, which are the creators, the cyclops is able to move like a regular sub, and also I didn't intend for a sci-fi newly built sub to be worn down
creations-chat 2021-06-02 12:33:04 if I put artificial shading then whats the point of the shadows within the game in the first place?
Also like I said its the actual color of the Cyclops from the game
creations-chat 2021-06-02 12:35:23 reference picture?
creations-chat 2021-06-02 12:41:36 Okay if my model of the cyclops looks like a white blob you seriously need to get your eyesight checked, also please don't compare my build to not only a Hall of Fame build, but also something that is worn down (also how do you know that he shaded for the shadows), and lastly the colors I picked from the pallet I admit I customized them to fit plane crazy so therefore I went with a bright grey (237,237,237) with a non-neon blue, that blue is darker than the surface of the water, not neon
creations-chat 2021-06-02 12:48:24 just saying if your gonna downvote for such a minuscule thing then don't downvote at all, especially when it defeats the purpose of the build, just saying if you or someone else spent a long amount of time and got told that the paint is too bright or there isn't enough variety even though its supposed to copy something, then I would expect you to legitmently question that person, especially when its only one person, so just saying as of now not only does your downvote mean nothing to me since you can't give a valid reason why, but also ya best believe I will downvote your next build for a stupid reason too.
creations-chat 2021-06-02 12:51:42 Hold you to that, just gonna take a picture and next time I see you disagree with some commenting on a tiny thing like that I'll post this as a reply.
creations-chat 2021-06-02 12:54:16 Then why not list those
creations-chat 2021-06-02 13:01:58 you know what I'm just gonna take it upon my self to block people who downvvote out of spite, by purposely setting the bar high for those who are't perfect builders. 
so much better
creations-chat 2021-06-02 22:32:32 <@!588596347272167456> My question to you, is (not talking about my sub anymore, I'll look into the colors) if you have such high standards then why do you practically have no creations posted, but also no proof that you can fulfill your own reasons for downvoting a good build. Like the one thing I saw when I looked up creations feedback is that you quite literally get called a mass downvoter even though you have upvoted, but I understand why they would say that, since you quite literally have no builds of your own that can compete with the people you downvote so therefore you do it out of spite.
creations-chat 2021-06-02 22:35:09 Yes, because if your gonna try and prove that your such a high standards person, then maybe have a build that you made with your high standards in mind, because all my builds are in support of my own standards.
creations-chat 2021-06-02 22:38:50 thats all cool and all, but wheres the proof?

mans sound like those kids who say, well my father said I'm a good singer, so I should be as famous as a pop star.
creations-chat 2021-06-02 22:41:45 Also I quite remember saying I wanted to see a BUILD, and also one that SUPPORTS, YOUR standards not someone elses.
exposed motor locking
paint needs to be changed
creations-chat 2021-06-02 22:46:29 bruh, look who's talking, you literally tell people to just rebuild stuff bc you can't give a good reason
creations-chat 2021-06-02 22:48:33 bro you are quite literally counteracting your own point that you made, and proving my point
might end up recording this, just because thats the reason I started this, was to see how far his pride will go
creations-chat 2021-06-02 22:53:00 mans is acting like what he said isnt hypocritical bc he told someone to rebuild it
<:KEKW:670310537300672528>
creations-chat 2021-06-02 22:55:42 Poor kid can't admit that he only downvotes others with his "high standards" just so that he can get kick out of them not getting their full score, and then can't hold a conversation very long because once someone asks for a creation on his standards he can't give one, sad.
creations-chat 2021-06-02 22:59:21 of course, damn should of seen that even though he doesn't meet your standards want to know why? I'll tell you. First, the build is not rounded enough and is too blocky. Second, no artificial shading. Third, not enough detail.
just saying if that wasn't on the hall of fame you probably would be the only downvote.

I love confronting cocky, know it all people.
creations-chat 2021-06-02 23:06:12 you want to know where I got those standards from, I got them from every build that you gave "feedback" to from the past few months.
<@!527653676022628353> I also looked and he has no upvotes on the blimp at all
creations-chat 2021-06-02 23:20:20 The zach kid probably has more downvotes than tony stark makes annually
creations-chat 2021-06-02 23:24:48 so sad that you guys don't understand economics and the marvel series.

1. The zach kid |2. probably has more downvotes |3. than tony stark |4. makes annually
1.Zach_man  2. how many builds he's downvoted 3. a millionaire        4. yearly income

also zach only kids downvote practically every build posted for stupid out of spite reasons.
creations-chat 2021-06-02 23:28:16 not mad at the downvote, mad at the kid doing it.

also zach I have listened to every word you've said hence why, when you said a stupid excuse I gave a logical answer

creations-chat 2021-06-02 23:36:53 there you go with those low effort excuses, I quite literally showed you how I proved you wrong on the things you made excuses to, and on top of that, your so prideful that when other people say the same things I'm saying and give proof that your a mass downvoter you say exactly what I replied too.
creations-chat 2021-06-02 23:38:54 That will most likely happen, hence why the kid is too scared to even post a build.

Also <@!720751430595772418> remember he has no recent builds, sad really.
creations-chat 2021-06-02 23:40:56 Can't wait to be hypercritical and callout everything even if its small and its a WIP, because you do it as well, at least thats what I saw when I looked you up in Creations-Feedback.

creations-chat 2021-06-02 23:46:22 too blocky. also holes in the wings, also prop is too basic, and finally helium.
creations-chat 2021-06-02 23:48:53 ok I'll admit didn't notice the disconnectors, but the rest I just gave my feedback thats all.
creations-chat 2021-06-02 23:51:03 yeah I know it looks fine I would upvote it, but I'm putting this thing and making my standard to be perfect.

<@!588596347272167456> your the one who picked to show that creation, not my fault you picked a WIP, pick a finished build next time.
creations-chat 2021-06-02 23:53:06 at least I have higher braincells than you my guy
creations-chat 2021-06-02 23:55:11 you posted that as you comeback and I quite literally said in this message

that I would be what you call high standards
creations-chat 2021-06-02 23:57:46 like I said, if you weren't listening, "Can't wait to be hypercritical and callout everything even if its small and its a WIP, because you do it as well, at least thats what I saw when I looked you up in Creations-Feedback."
creations-chat 2021-06-02 23:59:53 I like how I actually thought you were going to say I'll stop, but then you just did it and said stuff to purposely provoke me, and I'm the idiot
creations-chat 2021-06-03 00:02:14 "obc, im sorry, im just having a hard time actually conversing with this guy" what guy were you talking about then?
creations-chat 2021-06-03 00:04:41 mans gonna provkoke someone on purpose and ask them why they responded, I can't with Donald Trump stuff that I'm hearing.
creations-chat 2021-06-03 00:07:36 opera GX is better in my opinion, tbf

exactly
creations-chat 2021-06-03 00:09:37 wait really? and I deleted edge. fuck.

creations-chat 2021-06-04 22:07:06 how's this shape so far?
creations-chat 2021-06-04 22:12:56 or is this better
creations-chat 2021-06-04 22:14:58 sorry for all the pics, but is this better? I can't decide.

This is what I'm going to do for the underwater contest

creations-chat 2021-06-10 10:45:01 funny, if thats supposed to be a insult my way, then how about you get an expert rank before your start to talk shit.
creations-chat 2021-06-10 10:47:14 people be like that

<@!651361636657135617> you might want to be more specific when your addressing your side, because thats how misunderstandings happen.
creations-chat 2021-06-10 10:51:12 yeah so that could be used as a way to get at someone, just because they mean the same thing doesn't mean they are always used on the same side.

My only issue is that the plane has vented wings
not really bc it, no offense, looks like a noob built it
creations-chat 2021-06-10 14:02:12 just saying dude the main reason why most people will most definitely appreciate custom control surfaces is because its harder to make them and make the plane fly as good, so it takes more effort to build, vent wings look low key lazy.
creations-chat 2021-06-10 14:05:14 first of all how bad is your PC for you to lag from like 4 or 5 motors, and second of all I quite literally said with enough effort from balancing you'll get it to fly like you want.
creations-chat 2021-06-15 14:16:01 You should make the orange track and make it go around it, that would low key be insanely awesome.

maybe even make the different colors and have more on the track than just one, and have them on toggle so they're random just like irl.
creations-chat 2021-06-15 14:18:48 big intake anyone?
creations-chat 2021-06-15 14:21:35 if you haven't already, it might be a good idea to make the legs out of ice for smoother transportation, and if possible maybe even make them vibrate like the real things.

I have some ideas, if your able to join wind tunnel
creations-chat 2021-06-15 14:24:20 could try servos connected to other servos and use the glitch of them shaking when rotating to cause the vibration

that and anything like pistons, motor 1s, and yeah servos

could I maybe join a game with you, I would love to see the hex bug
creations-chat 2021-06-15 14:26:23 I was huge fan of them as child after all
creations-chat 2021-06-15 14:29:00 ngl I low key want to make the hex bugs, but smaller, and the track that they come with tbh, but the only thing keeping me from doing that is, the fact that it feels like copying you.
creations-chat 2021-06-15 14:31:27 if possible could I see other builds that you have made
creations-chat 2021-06-15 14:43:28 just because, why not, taken from that build I was wondering if you had any other impressive builds

and because I'm straight bored
creations-chat 2021-06-15 14:45:30 so is that a yes or no?

I was talking about could I see them in person, could you maybe join Wind Tunnel?
creations-chat 2021-06-15 14:47:32 oh ok
I have private server if you want to use that

I love this if possible, doubt it, but make it power something, maybe a car, using helium to lighten the car of course, but I love how you used the suspension as a means of automation for the engine, even though that I completely understand how it works now, I would of never thought to do this in the first place, amazing work
creations-chat 2021-07-09 14:39:47 not to sound creepy but could I join you, I would love to see what other creations you have.
creations-chat 2021-07-11 01:13:58 because some people can't handle honest/constructive criticism.
creations-chat 2021-07-11 01:16:27 like don't get me wrong I hate those toxic criticizers, but they were being constructive/honest and he couldn't take it
creations-chat 2021-07-11 01:18:29 oof

<@!720751430595772418> what PC specs you running, an i3?
creations-chat 2021-07-11 01:20:32 well tbf thats not bad. but its an intel product so I feel bad for your performance and wallet Ryzen 5 might be worth more to you.
creations-chat 2021-07-11 01:22:40 watch it be integrated graphics and 4 GB of memory
creations-chat 2021-07-11 01:25:26 mans gonna have Intel for his CPU and then AMD for his GPU, tf?
creations-chat 2021-07-11 01:27:31 see that doesn't even compare to my 9 year old laptop, with an intel i3, with windows 7 for the OS, and integrated graphics, and only 4 GBs of Memory/RAM
creations-chat 2021-07-11 01:33:15 well just in case, I have that for a backup, but my main is still weak, but it runs still quite good for the price: Laptop, backlit keys, 1920(I think)x1080p resolution, AMD Ryzen 4500u 5 with AMD Vega 10 Graphics I think, 16GBs of RAM, fingerprint scanner, I think 2 64 Bit mics, and 512GBs of SSD, this all goes for 600$.
creations-chat 2021-07-11 01:38:26 I have exactly half of my space left, calculated
creations-chat 2021-07-11 01:41:09 there is intakes though, aren't those intakes on the side.
creations-chat 2021-07-11 01:43:19 wdym by, model, like for reference, a 3D model I mean
creations-chat 2021-07-11 01:45:52 so basically, its not even your build, but yet you posted his creation, and didn't even say who it was, no credit given.
creations-chat 2021-07-11 01:48:47 still no credit was given, and on top of that really it isn't your build since you used him to make it, so technically you didn't make it, you stole it.
creations-chat 2021-07-11 01:50:53 more pics/different angles, and color the exposed motors, and since you have no interior maybe make the motor used for angles more hidden.
creations-chat 2021-07-11 01:53:06 btw you can make a group chat, and then make it so your by yourself, and then post all the pics there and then you can copy the picture link and put all the pictures into one message.
creations-chat 2021-07-11 01:55:27 my guy I have a military transport truck with locking up to about half the plot height and still hide it all, just saying, you can most likely hide it, since I had less space than you.
creations-chat 2021-07-11 01:57:56 I did the same thing with my truck I used the interior as a means for extra space, hence the lack of windows, just saying theres always room to improve, even small little things.
creations-chat 2021-07-11 02:00:24 btw the truck's total block count is 1450, but only about 950 of them are exterior details.

also just make the motor locked tower taller, therefore you have much more space.
creations-chat 2021-07-11 08:29:37 it happens to me too, its just roblox crap, windows OBS doesn't like roblox, on anyother game its fine
creations-chat 2021-07-11 08:31:41 roblox is always putting out updates that break something, its a less than common to see a good update
creations-chat 2021-07-11 08:33:43 no capturing with windows OBS/game bar, has done that for a year now, its a normal thing for me, hence why I put my captures through streamable to crop the size.
creations-chat 2021-07-11 08:35:48 must have done something different, or you got lucky
creations-chat 2021-07-17 13:03:52 <@!561155604014694400>  needs more color variation

creations-chat 2021-07-22 16:36:59 whats that supposed to be?
creations-chat 2021-07-22 16:53:19 Sorry for the late response, but my main problems with it are as follows: engines look far out of scale to the actual plane (meaning, they are too big for the size of the plane and the thickness of the main wings), better color variation, better photo (to far from the actual plane so therefore its almost impossible to make out details with ease), the main wings are possibly too far back and will most likely cause the nose to be heavier (meaning, taking off is harder than it should be), and lastly (at least from what I can see in the photo) the wings (both main and tail) are too thin (maybe motorlock some halfblocks or find another way to thicken the wings). This is my honest opinion, and so there is no ill will, I'll say this, "I would hold myself to these standards as well".

Thanks for reading!

creations-chat 2021-07-30 05:02:22 also I will say this, this build is the first build where I used more than maybe about 10 motors for locking, so I'm still new to it

<@!260235884937347084> thanks, so what other green colors would you recommend, what I mean is like the name of the color and I'll try and replicate it
creations-chat 2021-07-30 05:06:38 the cab color is 51, 71, 51 and the bed is 31, 51, 31 and the chassis is 51, 51, 51 and lastly all others are either 11, 11, 11 or 45, 45, 45.

so like using those variants, I'm guessing, for depth and any suggestion possibly for the bed bc its a bit dark but something else
creations-chat 2021-07-30 05:09:33 here
creations-chat 2021-07-30 06:48:07 Is this color of green better, sorry but the color you gave me didn't, at least to me, look good in mass.

creations-chat 2021-09-27 20:31:59 what is it?

a drone?

oh, is it custom or do you have reference pics, or like a plane you combined with another
creations-chat 2021-09-27 20:34:15 can you show build mode, bc I have an idea but idk if you'll be able to fit it easily, if not then maybe a dark like military grey
creations-chat 2021-09-27 23:41:50 So I added some mirrors, thoughts?

creations-chat 2021-09-27 23:45:33 Well if so, then the last thing I got to do is replace some of the cameras with text to make the build mode look nicer, bc that is a mess

creations-chat 2021-09-27 23:47:35 what is the white at? Like RGB code, and maybe add some artificial shading
creations-chat 2021-09-27 23:51:08 ok so maybe try, 180, 180, 180, and if that is too dark for the entire thing, try and use that for the bottom of the heli for shading

<@!287454032250011649> wheres the argument? ok
creations-chat 2021-09-27 23:54:15 Itâ€™s based of this is you knew, plus it isnâ€™t a mini copter 

What?
creations-chat 2021-09-27 23:57:25 It isnt a mini copter in the pic it is but I made a bigger size a realistic one for Roblox players.

Late me translate I think:

It isn't a Mini-Copter in the picture, but I made a bigger size, that's realistic for the Roblox Community.
creations-chat 2021-09-27 23:59:54 lets be fair there is almost no way that fighting isn't gonna happen in this channel, especially when you have people of different build levels, and different knowledge of things, so if they made it like 10 minutes, people would still argue.
creations-chat 2021-09-28 00:02:15 <@!839929866181673030> question do you think that if your build is higher scale its bad, bc a lot of people typically build bigger to fit more details in.

also tree I full heartily agree with you, the mans a wall.

creations-chat 2021-09-28 00:35:21 stfu high school/your acting if I'm young is childish

Sorry what, was that your attempt at insulting me?
creations-chat 2021-09-28 00:38:25 First year but school doesnâ€™t start in 4 months never said Iâ€™m trying to insult you (back to listening to music 

let me fix your grammar:

I'm a Freshmen, but school doesn't start in about 4 months, by the way I never was trying to insult you. I'm going to go back to listening to music.
creations-chat 2021-09-28 00:41:33 I know right, I have a little sister that's a Freshmen this year, and her grammar is FAR better than this dude.
creations-chat 2021-09-28 00:43:42 omg I remember watching that like 10 years ago, such a good show, at least my young self thought so.
creations-chat 2021-09-28 00:46:59 What I like is that he's only saying this after a few hours of him arguing with people, and he calls us stupid, funny.
creations-chat 2021-09-28 00:49:37 okay bean where did you live bud?

And we were insulting you because you never opened up with that, its your fault.
creations-chat 2021-09-28 00:52:29 bro ikr, btw <@!839929866181673030> your excuse is that other people who weren't in the argument knew you weren't American, great excuse, and we're stupid, funny.
creations-chat 2021-09-28 00:54:50 just saying spam pinging mod isn't gonna make them get here any faster, instead it might annoy them, so maybe stop, and also if you're not used to fighting in this channel, then you gotta lot to learn.

Little tip, NEVER post how long it took you to build a creation, especially when it's lower than 72 hours, because I bet one of the first things people are thinking, is that you could've spent more time on it, and made it better.
creations-chat 2021-09-28 01:05:13 https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/384025409945337856/892213894301503510
Vented/cheese grater wings, last I checked planes usually don't have long holes in their wings.

<@!712219827564970036> other than that easy fix, it looks quite good dude, love that wings and vents are on an angle.
