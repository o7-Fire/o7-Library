creations-chat 2021-08-14 07:46:01 What plane should I make?
creations-chat 2021-08-14 07:48:03 Fighter if possible, cosmetics mainly but PVP is a possibility. I don't mind if it's new or real.
help 2021-08-14 07:57:16 I'll work on a Su-33
help 2021-08-14 07:59:58 I can add it cosmetically but it won't be functional.
help 2021-08-14 08:00:34 Plus, I have little experience in motorlocking and the only times I've majorly used it is in thrust for my old a10, and in my sr71.
help 2021-08-14 08:00:58 But I'll give it a shot :D
help 2021-08-14 09:16:53 <@!548973346805776396> Are you there?

help 2021-08-14 13:51:55 It's so annoying.
help 2021-08-14 13:52:07 I have it in the right place but the spinlocks spazm when I explode the motorlock
help 2021-08-14 13:54:08 My spinlocks aren't working.
help 2021-08-14 13:54:11 This is so dumb.
help 2021-08-14 13:54:47 Waitnvm

creations-chat 2021-08-16 11:01:00 If anybody could give me some feedback on my build in <#384025409945337856> , that would be great :D
creations-chat 2021-08-16 11:09:57 Wingspan or the body itself?
help 2021-08-16 11:18:24 So uh
help 2021-08-16 11:18:28 How do I make thin missiles?
creations-chat 2021-08-16 11:18:59 Heres a screenie, tell me what you think
creations-chat 2021-08-16 11:21:31 Yeah, I think I used a lot of space trying to like blend the body into the wings. I can see their point. It's always a bit tricky to make an aircraft that's actually real because it has to be spot on to be good. This is why my unique interceptor is doing alright.
creations-chat 2021-08-16 11:24:26 Thanks a ton :D, I'll use all this feedback to improve the plane and repost it some other time.
creations-chat 2021-08-16 11:34:19 Holy crap thats awesome. On a unrelated note, how am I able to make my transition from body to canards smoother?
creations-chat 2021-08-16 11:37:23 I did what you said, whatcha think :D ?
creations-chat 2021-08-16 11:46:19 How do I make this transition into the canard smoother?
creations-chat 2021-08-16 11:49:07 Basically like spin locks? I'd feel comfortable doing them but this is my first motorlocking and it's getting a bit complex.
creations-chat 2021-08-16 11:51:53 huh, springs, disconnectors? confusion can we talk in <#478584971670454284> ?
creations-chat 2021-08-16 12:04:53 Ok I'm too noob to use angle locks but this is what it's gonna be for now, lmk what you think
creations-chat 2021-08-16 12:09:29 But big engines look cool :( Also, update screenshot after cooldown.
creations-chat 2021-08-16 12:14:24 Ok so It's smoother now and the engines are smol :(
creations-chat 2021-08-16 12:17:20 R.I.P my Su33's upvotes. 5 - 17 ratio.
creations-chat 2021-08-16 12:23:16 4-18 ratio and a lag machine crashes my server and save data :D
creations-chat 2021-08-16 12:25:47 Lag machine crashes my entire server <:trollface:775024642104229898>  I hate some people with a burning passion
creations-chat 2021-08-16 12:29:57 Bro I'm about to lose my su33 save data because the server is crashing
creations-chat 2021-08-17 07:03:00 Which is better:
A:
creations-chat 2021-08-17 07:05:57 B:
creations-chat 2021-08-17 07:48:18 ★
creations-chat 2021-08-17 08:04:46 I'm not an expert but that's sick!
creations-chat 2021-08-17 08:39:42 Better than before or nah?
creations-chat 2021-08-17 08:42:15 ★ paint this red
creations-chat 2021-08-17 08:46:26 Good?
creations-chat 2021-08-17 08:57:05 Cheers that's really helpful.
creations-chat 2021-08-17 09:11:35 I upgraded stuff based on your overlay, there are just some things I cannot possibly fix due to my stupidity in angle locking and stuff, but if you could overlay this then it'd be great :D
creations-chat 2021-08-17 09:16:05 What colour / colour scheme should I make it?
creations-chat 2021-08-17 09:18:21 I'll work on it when I get back, thanks a ton!
creations-chat 2021-08-17 09:30:41 It's very tricky to paint it correctly cause I have a few too many motorlocked pieces.
creations-chat 2021-08-17 09:38:04 I'll take a larger dark take on the regular blue camo.
creations-chat 2021-08-17 10:12:26 nvm doing your idea
creations-chat 2021-08-17 10:15:34 Good?
creations-chat 2021-08-17 10:24:59 What can I improve?
creations-chat 2021-08-17 10:27:31 Fair enoguh.
creations-chat 2021-08-17 10:46:56 ★ paint it red
creations-chat 2021-08-17 10:55:44 Can't do that, I tried but I can't conceal them when putting them away if they're longer.
creations-chat 2021-08-17 11:03:12 I have no good colour schemes for the Su33 flanker.
creations-chat 2021-08-17 11:05:53 I was just working on my Su-33 and I got banned.
creations-chat 2021-08-17 12:53:19 I was mad at a spawnkilling hovering shredder tank.
creations-chat 2021-08-19 09:54:20 I'm making a eurofighter typhoon but I'm too lazy to motorlock for this build.
creations-chat 2021-08-19 09:59:36 When he realises that there is a gun in pvp blocks that takes up 1 block of space O_O
creations-chat 2021-08-21 04:07:55 some quick su57 superiority fighter with lots of weapons.
creations-chat 2021-08-21 04:14:45 Weepons
creations-chat 2021-08-21 04:21:14 haha fixing it up now :D
creations-chat 2021-08-21 04:42:10 better?
creations-chat 2021-08-21 04:50:09 now a working cockpit
creations-chat 2021-08-21 08:18:03 Su57, good or nah?
creations-chat 2021-08-21 08:31:10 how do i improve the nose?
creations-chat 2021-08-21 08:34:09 Better?
creations-chat 2021-08-21 11:50:06 Good or nah
creations-chat 2021-08-21 11:52:35 Alright, thanks.
creations-chat 2021-08-21 12:21:40 Better paint?
creations-chat 2021-08-21 12:24:09 I'm not very good with that :/
creations-chat 2021-08-21 12:44:15 Wings are a bit of a pain to fix because the flaps and the limitations of the regular delta wing panels. I could try to use spin locks to angle them but it would leave exposed motors and glitchy effects.
creations-chat 2021-08-21 13:00:52 i getchu, but like, I'll try to have it as close as possible as well as functional
creations-chat 2021-08-21 14:39:36 Better cockpit?
creations-chat 2021-08-21 15:26:20 Its probably my paintjob its kinda trash And I'm gonna neaten it up
creations-chat 2021-08-21 15:29:08 Looks epic but I'm not a very good builder :/
creations-chat 2021-08-21 23:55:55 Why is it not good? What can I fix?
creations-chat 2021-08-22 11:12:10 <@456226577798135808> isn't that van from a tutorial?
creations-chat 2021-08-22 11:33:46 Better than my last posts or nah?
creations-chat 2021-08-22 11:42:28 How so?
creations-chat 2021-08-22 11:44:32 I see, it's just that I'm not able to make it slope down for that long so I made it flat in some spots to try to get it longer sloped/
creations-chat 2021-08-22 11:48:20 It might be the camera angle, I think they're decent size.
creations-chat 2021-08-22 11:54:34 I would be able to fix the slope from the nose if I had resize tool :(
creations-chat 2021-08-22 12:03:56 idk if this is an upgrade?
creations-chat 2021-08-22 12:16:23 I'm trying to angle the cockpit but it's insanely difficult, there is this part that goes up on the sides but it's hard to recreate without making it a bit bulky.
creations-chat 2021-08-22 12:37:43 Good?
creations-chat 2021-08-22 13:05:23 found this slick new design
creations-chat 2021-08-22 13:08:46 
creations-chat 2021-08-23 08:50:41 Does this look alright for a su 57? 2 mins there is a glitch making my window look crap
creations-chat 2021-08-23 08:53:25 I know it's a bloody pain to get it right.
creations-chat 2021-08-23 09:06:26 Better?
creations-chat 2021-08-23 10:36:01 huh
creations-chat 2021-08-23 11:52:45 You think my Su57 will get upvotes or nah?
creations-chat 2021-08-23 11:57:15 <@!345527706340818944>I wanna try to make the paint look smoother idk how tho
creations-chat 2021-08-23 12:01:34 shittttt, how do I make the wings more angled?
creations-chat 2021-08-23 12:18:25 it's so difficult I'm gonna explode
creations-chat 2021-08-23 12:22:04 Does anybody know how to angle the wings to resemble the actual su 57?
creations-chat 2021-08-23 12:26:04 but how? every time I try it it either won't fit or bugs out
creations-chat 2021-08-23 12:32:30 I got like no space tho
creations-chat 2021-08-24 08:57:18 <@!345527706340818944> Yo, are you there?
help 2021-08-24 09:12:22 I wanna angle lock my borders to a cockpit but I'm too lazy and I don't wanna risk having exposed motorlock.
help 2021-08-24 09:14:12 Does it look Ok?
help 2021-08-24 09:14:16 Su 57 btw
help 2021-08-24 09:15:15 Pretend they were angled in the first picture
help 2021-08-24 09:15:53 
help 2021-08-24 09:16:09 
help 2021-08-24 09:16:45 Thanks.
help 2021-08-24 09:17:50 Alright
help 2021-08-24 09:19:57 
help 2021-08-24 09:20:06 You can't lock them, but you can use them to move entire wings.
help 2021-08-24 09:20:36 The paint?
help 2021-08-24 09:20:55 oh wait this
help 2021-08-24 09:20:56 1 sec

help 2021-08-24 09:21:48 Wait I'm confused
help 2021-08-24 09:22:16 But that's the paint making it look blocky, right?
help 2021-08-24 09:22:36 Wait am I wrong?
help 2021-08-24 09:23:26 But don't I need to angle lock stuff to make it look smooth?
help 2021-08-24 09:24:14 1 sec gtg
help 2021-08-24 09:24:15 brb in a bit
help 2021-08-24 09:35:48 back
help 2021-08-24 09:37:07 <@!714878625484243101> Do I need to motorlock more delta wings so that it looks smooth?
help 2021-08-24 09:40:20 Ok I tried to do it, and they were all in the right place, but they like flash in each other
help 2021-08-24 09:40:29 And it's glitchy.
help 2021-08-24 09:43:01 Wait I just did something epic.
help 2021-08-24 09:43:15 I fit 2 1x1 delta wings in the same block space with motorlock and it's not glitchy
help 2021-08-24 09:43:38 Ohhhh.
help 2021-08-24 09:43:42 Ok you're epic.
help 2021-08-24 09:43:44 Thanks.
help 2021-08-24 09:43:56 Yeah, looking good.
help 2021-08-24 09:44:02 I'll post a nother image later.
help 2021-08-24 09:49:00 but, some of the delta wings aren't holding on, and there is no way to hold them together.
help 2021-08-24 09:49:48 Wait I got a good idea.
help 2021-08-24 09:49:54 Holy crap I'm so epic and cool.
help 2021-08-24 09:53:02 I just had them all on the motorlock
help 2021-08-24 10:11:17 
help 2021-08-24 10:11:18 Good?
help 2021-08-24 10:13:16 Okay I think the last upgrade is gonna be the cockpit.
help 2021-08-24 10:13:32 How do I have a ring going in the glass?
help 2021-08-24 10:14:44 So yeah, it's a big tricky imo.
help 2021-08-24 10:19:17 I added my own personal twist to the paint.
help 2021-08-24 10:19:19 Makes it unique
help 2021-08-24 10:23:31 I think my Main is unbanned.
help 2021-08-24 10:23:37 Hopefully my Su33 is still saved.
help 2021-08-24 10:25:12 nvm 30 more mins
creations-chat 2021-08-24 10:29:50 Epic or naw?
creations-chat 2021-08-24 10:32:50 Yeah somebody told me they were too small
creations-chat 2021-08-24 10:35:01 The 3 triangular sections at the back of the wings need to be deeper. The intakes and cockpit/body need to be wider
creations-chat 2021-08-24 10:51:47 Feel it get stiff? uhhhhhh
creations-chat 2021-08-24 10:54:00 Now it's time to build an american school for further detail.

||(this is a joke please don't get offended)||
creations-chat 2021-08-24 11:03:06 yes hehe
creations-chat 2021-08-24 11:05:25 HEH what
creations-chat 2021-08-24 11:07:40 I think I get you but idk if I got the space you know
creations-chat 2021-08-24 11:29:36 joe mama
creations-chat 2021-08-24 11:37:51 It seems that maybe my Su-57 is kinda bad.
creations-chat 2021-08-24 11:41:37 Maybe it's the first image that's bad? I'm anxiously looking at the voting.
creations-chat 2021-08-27 11:24:51 put an f14 inspired painjob on a su35 lol?
creations-chat 2021-08-27 11:28:38 Okay I don't have enough space to put fancy text and symbols on the su 35 :(
creations-chat 2021-08-27 11:31:00 I think it looks awesome
creations-chat 2021-08-27 11:43:14 What other features should I put on my su 57? Not thrust vector because my motorlocking completely prevents it.
creations-chat 2021-08-27 11:45:55 Apparently it doesn't. What else could I add? I could try the opening cockpit like you suggested <@!751424469657976843> , but I could run into issues as my canopy is majorly motorlocked. I'll try to find a way around it.
creations-chat 2021-08-27 11:49:40 I'll try the fancy landing gears, I'm pretty bad at it so if it's too obnoxious when retracted, I won't do them, as I'd rather have a streamline flying experience.
creations-chat 2021-08-27 12:03:08 okay landing gear is a big nono, looks extremely bad on my plane, and I have no space to make good looking gears wanna see the jet tho?
creations-chat 2021-08-27 12:07:42 guns hehe
creations-chat 2021-08-27 12:11:16 thanks mate, you build sick ships, they're awesome
creations-chat 2021-08-27 12:33:56 Good greyscale + blue paintjob?
creations-chat 2021-08-27 12:36:45 what
creations-chat 2021-08-27 12:40:37 can you link me their su 57?
creations-chat 2021-08-27 12:42:41 I wanna make the souless one bcuz general grievous is cool
creations-chat 2021-08-27 12:57:31 we don't really look anything alike?
creations-chat 2021-08-27 13:00:06 I guess so, it's just common to use triangle wedges because that's the only somewhat accurate design. I also don't want to be rude, but I don't understand how it got so many upvotes?
help 2021-08-27 13:09:58 what are those thin things at the front of the tank in <#384025409945337856> , they look like little cylinders, what are they?
help 2021-08-27 13:31:52 use the delete tool to delete a block
creations-chat 2021-08-27 13:33:50 black one or white one looks good <@!751424469657976843>
creations-chat 2021-08-27 13:36:51 thank you man, I'm sure the f22 is gonna turn out amazing, excited to see a cool f22.
creations-chat 2021-08-27 13:40:10 if you have the space, go for it, if you don't just try to focus on appearance.
creations-chat 2021-08-27 13:44:04 Try to make the engines look better like russian said, I'd recommend wedge 1x4 and triangular wedge 1x4 engines. + motorlock does help make stuff look good
creations-chat 2021-08-27 13:47:23 <@!389756407483990028> The colour needs to be less "eye-popping" and the vertical stabilisers are a bit too curved in my opinion.
creations-chat 2021-08-27 13:49:25 Yeah I like those engines you can incorporate cylinder 2 2x2s to make them longer if you want.
creations-chat 2021-08-27 13:51:30 That's starting to look real nice. I personally think a Su27 or 33 back design would look nice, in that joining part there is a bit of a curved beam that comes out a bit, but that's up to you.
creations-chat 2021-08-27 13:54:25 Looking good, try to make the front part of it less curved, but even with curves it's alright.
creations-chat 2021-08-27 14:11:55 Lava spitter afterburner?
creations-chat 2021-08-27 14:19:49 that looks pretty good
creations-chat 2021-08-28 01:23:14 Nice engines?
creations-chat 2021-08-28 01:31:40 Afterburners lol
help 2021-08-28 01:49:21 Every time I use hover drives my game goes to 30 fps, is this normal or fixable?
creations-chat 2021-08-28 01:53:58 I just realised if you attach something to a camera, you can rotate the camera and therefore rotate the entire thing to your exact need.

creations-chat 2021-08-28 02:36:19 You can have delta or normal winged fighter jets, you need more angle either way <@!814652641207386123>
Fix the cockpit and the nose, especially the random blocks that make it uneven.

creations-chat 2021-08-28 03:22:41 Radar station, also, it doesn't seem too tall to me?
help 2021-08-28 03:30:08 Yp need to have more control by adding flaps or more control surfaces
help 2021-08-28 03:30:26 currently it is too heavy, and doesn't have enough upwards lift due to not enough control surfaces
help 2021-08-28 03:30:49 wings will help it glide and fly, but control surfaces and flaps will let you pull up down and roll.
creations-chat 2021-08-28 03:35:59 I think it's alright, but it's just not interesting enough for an upvote. It's just a red car. I'd recommend adding a 155m Howitzer onto the back. Right now it just looks, meh.
creations-chat 2021-08-28 03:43:40 Only reason you have the designer role is for making a cringe pixel art that probably took 5 minutes. Not a valid argument.
creations-chat 2021-08-28 03:45:56 Telling me that this took longer than 5 minutes? That's disappointing.

creations-chat 2021-08-28 13:14:33 Hehe afterburners are still pretty :D
creations-chat 2021-08-28 13:17:33 Which is the tutorial, link the message to me?
creations-chat 2021-08-28 13:22:02 Oh yeah him, he just copied it but took a large shit onto the canopy and nose.
creations-chat 2021-08-28 14:12:39 It was the body piece connecting to the engines. It's the curved piece or the "bump" look at the centre of the plane
creations-chat 2021-08-29 03:55:53 What engine looks better? Round or flatter?
creations-chat 2021-08-29 04:01:31 Stfu cringeass pixel art egotistical swine. This is why nobody loves you.

creations-chat 2021-08-29 04:22:29 Use cameras if you want the text to be completely invisible, or just put a full stop in all of the text to make the text smaller.
creations-chat 2021-08-29 04:46:01 Is the shortened nose better?
creations-chat 2021-08-29 04:51:41 So longer is better?
creations-chat 2021-08-29 04:56:21 How do I turn off engine fire?
creations-chat 2021-08-29 05:01:11 Anybody wanna compare Su 57's for accuracy? I need to know if my wing size is right?
creations-chat 2021-08-29 05:07:20 The real su 57 wingspan to length ratio is 11:6, mine is 11:7, good enough I guess.
creations-chat 2021-08-29 05:09:24 The real wingspan is 63% the length of the body. Mine is 56% of the body length.
creations-chat 2021-08-29 05:19:43 Okay this might be my final design, worth posting?

creations-chat 2021-09-02 07:49:01 Not sure how to make the engine piece fade nicely into the fuselage.
creations-chat 2021-09-02 08:02:13 I did the intakes.
creations-chat 2021-09-03 01:33:13 I think I'll stop working on my Su-57, it's clearly not very good. Time to make a custom plane.
creations-chat 2021-09-03 01:43:39 Plane. <@!467459282250629120> There is not much I can do to improve it, since the fuselage and engine pieces were made on the wrong half block level, and I do not have enough space or effort to redo them and motorlock them a half block down.
creations-chat 2021-09-03 04:09:09 Your su 57 looks awesome, I saw it a bit ago in creations and I’m blown away by how good it looks.

creations-chat 2021-09-03 09:28:20 Wings are bad, is the body alright though?
creations-chat 2021-09-03 10:27:54 It is an f15.

creations-chat 2021-09-07 11:48:13 Cries in no thrust vectoring.
creations-chat 2021-09-07 11:51:50 I had the option of thrust vectoring, or keeping my afterburners and I'm too lazy to change them out. Afterburners and cool effects = votes. Do you want to compare in game?
creations-chat 2021-09-07 11:56:06 It might be able to work, but I think the cameras will glitch it out. Can I see your plane in game?
creations-chat 2021-09-07 11:58:20 This top section also pokes into my engines. They make the entire fuselage silky smooth and I'd rather keep them.
creations-chat 2021-09-07 12:14:12 all good bro, im heading off too, have a good rest of your day
creations-chat 2021-09-08 11:37:15 What colour scheme should I make my Su 57?

creations-chat 2021-09-08 12:29:53 Good or nah? What do you mean by that Atomic?
creations-chat 2021-09-09 07:23:57 Incredible, the size makes it viable for carrier landings in most planes.

creations-chat 2021-09-11 03:50:01 Wait does that actually work?
creations-chat 2021-09-11 04:22:44 Excessive use of cameras and angle locks as well as random little pieces here and there.
creations-chat 2021-09-11 04:44:42 my bad bro, I'll fix it up
creations-chat 2021-09-11 04:48:58 Update, removed the exposed motor lock

creations-chat 2021-09-11 09:02:01 maybe bigger elevators?
creations-chat 2021-09-11 09:36:11 Trying to make sure all edges are flush.
creations-chat 2021-09-11 09:39:07 I hate this fuselage part and there is nothing I can do to fix it.

creations-chat 2021-09-14 08:24:58 Fuselage good lol?
creations-chat 2021-09-14 08:27:10 Not enough room for custom angle :(
creations-chat 2021-09-14 08:29:19 Not sure what to fix or improve now :|
creations-chat 2021-09-14 08:47:38 Just had an idea, should I fit a bunch of smoke pipes in my jet to recreate a "sonic boom" effect?
creations-chat 2021-09-14 08:55:09 I'm not sure. Also, I can try to work on the nose but i have very little space to hide my motors
creations-chat 2021-09-14 09:26:52 Yeah but it's difficult to get a continuous angle at that position.
creations-chat 2021-09-14 09:29:40 Basically my motor lock tower kinda  stops it from angling that much but I'm trying really hard to get alternatives and stuff. before this I'm gonna try to make the airbrakes. Another idea I have is to have the engines just curve down into the fuselage instead of connecting to create a Y
creations-chat 2021-09-14 09:37:04 Left or right?
creations-chat 2021-09-14 09:41:46 Better?
creations-chat 2021-09-14 09:53:02 This is just the most I can get from angle locking.
creations-chat 2021-09-14 09:59:45 - Makes Plane
- Receives criticism for attempting to make the plane because it has been made before.
creations-chat 2021-09-14 10:05:15 However you said Su-57 and right after I posted an image of my Su-57, questionable.
creations-chat 2021-09-14 10:08:04 Better?
creations-chat 2021-09-14 10:10:27 Experimental Airbrakes.
creations-chat 2021-09-14 10:16:25 Better nose. P.S should I have airbrakes or a simulated horizontal thrust vectoring system with the Vertical Stabilisers?
creations-chat 2021-09-14 10:20:28 Wait I can actually do that hold up. Haha it would work flawlessly if my build didn't put me at 10fps and 1000 ping.
creations-chat 2021-09-14 10:24:35 poo
creations-chat 2021-09-14 10:27:40 My earliest Su 57, It's now some sort of custom ground attack jet.
creations-chat 2021-09-14 10:29:52 Exactly my point.
creations-chat 2021-09-14 10:32:11 Without the exposed motors that would be perfect, still a good build though. Also <@!671639907281666069> wdym?
creations-chat 2021-09-14 10:35:53 And how does that apply to me?
creations-chat 2021-09-14 10:40:04 <@456226577798135808> Just an idea but if you have space you can motorlock a 1x4 wedge and 2 1x4 triangle wedges down half a block to create the back of the cockpit, just a random idea, completely up to you.
creations-chat 2021-09-15 09:44:35 Is this nose alright?
creations-chat 2021-09-15 09:59:11 New fuselage desgin, good or nah?
Also the sharp edge behind canopy is an angling mistake I was just rushing my angling.
creations-chat 2021-09-15 10:03:03 Can you help me make it better? What is wrong with it?
creations-chat 2021-09-15 10:05:58 Alright, will do.
creations-chat 2021-09-15 10:08:37 Spazzing out, the motor 2's keep glitching.
creations-chat 2021-09-15 10:14:36 Maybe I should try regular motors?
creations-chat 2021-09-15 10:20:44 I have like 8 motor 2's and they make it look ugly. 
2 of them on each side are for the vertical stabilisers and airbrakes as well as yaw.
creations-chat 2021-09-15 10:23:11 Yeah but if I try to cover them or something they'll start spazzing.
creations-chat 2021-09-15 10:25:42 Also the nose doesn't seem too long to me. Also the motor 2's will be worked upon in a sec. But I don't really want to change the motor 2's because it risks the functionality and it's not all too bad.
creations-chat 2021-09-15 10:35:24 Very good idea, however I'm tight on motorlock tower space once again and I'm not making more towers or continuing my tower.
creations-chat 2021-09-15 10:37:43 I would make the rear of the wings either completely straight or have the slightest increase when going into the body so the wing looks like |_/ or \_/. Oh wait that's just a shadow nevermind. Very very good build but try to lock some normal wing panels to stop the cheese grater.
creations-chat 2021-09-15 10:50:23 Ah, all good.
creations-chat 2021-09-15 10:53:31 Air Brakes lol
creations-chat 2021-09-15 10:56:42 That's why I have so many motors, the stabilisers are able to rotate for the yaw and brakes.
creations-chat 2021-09-15 10:58:51 Haha, but, it works.
creations-chat 2021-09-15 11:01:42 Another issue, my hand keeps resting on the motor lock keys.
creations-chat 2021-09-15 11:14:11 yees
creations-chat 2021-09-16 07:51:34 Fuselage could be a lot better, make the nose longer as well. Try to smooth the entire thing out as best you can.
creations-chat 2021-09-16 11:46:00 Fix the blocks and smooth it out
creations-chat 2021-09-16 11:48:43 Not just the paint, the paint is alright. Fix the poking out bits
creations-chat 2021-09-16 13:00:19 True that
creations-chat 2021-09-16 13:02:24 Very good build, would recommend making the stabaliser further out and not on the engines, but thats up to you.
creations-chat 2021-09-16 13:18:49 If its difficult it's not a biggie, still a good looking build.
creations-chat 2021-09-16 13:23:45 Hot take but:
Putting texts to decorate your decent builds = upvotes
creations-chat 2021-09-17 08:32:46 Honest Feedback:

It's still very choppy, and the rear elevators seem to be misshapen.  It looks very duck-like, exposed motorlocks also lessen how good it is. Cockpit is alright as it is Vulpens design but it can be improved slightly with angle locks. There are also some gaps near the cockpit.

What's good:
The angle locking on the fuselage is correctly angled, and the paint scheme seems to be very smooth. The cockpit is pretty good, the landing gears are functional, there are small details such as russian flags and radar. From what I've seen the intakes seem pretty good.

Take this how you want, sorry if I came off as rude, I still think it's an awesome build.
creations-chat 2021-09-17 08:49:37 Which side of the fuselage is better?
creations-chat 2021-09-19 11:58:40 Added 8 locked motors  to redo my fuselage, with painstaking effort into hiding everything somewhat flawlessly. It might not look good, but I think it looks better.
creations-chat 2021-09-20 05:40:20 Does this nose look alright?
creations-chat 2021-09-20 08:53:23 Sound I try to angle lock the nose?
creations-chat 2021-09-20 10:10:24 Personally I think that this nose looks the best out of what I've tried. <@!739369649971527720>  yeah that's the problem
creations-chat 2021-09-20 10:12:52 I've got no other options to be completely honest. There is very very little space to hide motors, furthermore there is not much space on the motorlock tower itself.
creations-chat 2021-09-20 10:44:57 The product of motorlocc
creations-chat 2021-09-21 05:35:34 Because it looks bad
creations-chat 2021-09-21 06:51:28 Probably the best i've gotten from locking the nose

creations-chat 2021-09-26 06:39:36 Getting the main body down
creations-chat 2021-09-26 06:53:12 You reckon these proportions are aight?
creations-chat 2021-09-26 07:12:45 
creations-chat 2021-09-27 08:34:10 Idk what's wrong with my f15 it just looks off
creations-chat 2021-09-27 08:36:27 Anybody know what's wrong with my f15 shape I can't really tell
creations-chat 2021-09-27 08:40:32 
creations-chat 2021-09-27 08:59:14 Its the bump thing
creations-chat 2021-09-27 09:05:12 Any better?
creations-chat 2021-09-27 09:08:21 I'll add half a wing panel to the back there
creations-chat 2021-09-27 09:12:13 Any better?
creations-chat 2021-09-27 09:16:48 How this look?
creations-chat 2021-09-27 09:22:06 Better?
creations-chat 2021-09-27 09:26:31 What's wrong with them?
creations-chat 2021-09-27 09:30:27 I think the current ones are the best it's going to get.
creations-chat 2021-09-27 09:32:39 Oh, I thought they were a lot too thin. I'll try that design again.
creations-chat 2021-09-27 09:39:41 This seems fine to me.
creations-chat 2021-09-27 09:45:15 Bruh you do realise this channel is called "creations feedback", I'm just trying to make a good plane that is well received in a reasonable time.
Am I supposed to wait for your approval to post a screenshot and talk to somebody?
creations-chat 2021-09-27 09:51:53 And you might need to take some advice on "trying" to improve your plane

creations-chat 2021-09-27 09:56:19 Nah it's all good, It's not too toxic I'm just annoyed that he's being a prick when he has every right to not look at my screenshots or read my messages.
creations-chat 2021-09-27 10:06:01 You complained about me posting screenshots and conversing. When I talk to somebody, I really do not need your approval when you do not have to care.
creations-chat 2021-09-27 10:08:40 Fair enough, meet me in <#384021699466756107>  <@!447139512707973120>
creations-chat 2021-09-27 10:10:54 Caveman? You're the one so heated because you observed somebody else do something completely normal?
creations-chat 2021-09-27 10:21:03 i can no longer talk in this channel because somebody doesn't like it :(((
creations-chat 2021-09-27 10:23:10 funny how my build is harshly criticized not based on the actual building talent involved but the fact that I sent a message asking for feedback :(((
creations-chat 2021-09-27 10:26:43 man fuck your build you've posted 2 screenshots shut the fuck up

creations-chat 2021-09-27 11:55:20 thanks man
creations-chat 2021-09-27 13:20:08 What modern fighter jet should I make next? Looking for something interesting and easy, but not too easy.
creations-chat 2021-09-27 13:31:38 I think I will work on my f15

creations-chat 2021-09-28 02:22:35 Started detailing it, what do you think?
creations-chat 2021-09-28 02:36:02 <@!721908663694131281> That build is really really superb, I'm left in awe.
creations-chat 2021-09-28 03:01:01 Good?
creations-chat 2021-09-28 03:10:55 My first plane to have functional landing gear :) ||Yeah it's stock lol I'm too lazy 😩 ||
creations-chat 2021-09-28 03:35:07 Overdetailed?I just added a bunch of signs not sure if it makes it look ugly
creations-chat 2021-09-28 03:37:08 What should I add?
creations-chat 2021-09-28 03:54:18 how
creations-chat 2021-09-28 04:12:15 Ground scraper.
creations-chat 2021-09-28 04:17:50 Detail and less ground scraping.
creations-chat 2021-09-28 06:37:31 Is this a good custom intake?

creations-chat 2021-09-28 06:44:50 lol
creations-chat 2021-09-28 11:01:28 still looks great
creations-chat 2021-09-28 12:14:48 Same, other than the exposed motorlock it's a pretty nice build.
creations-chat 2021-09-28 12:23:11 Having pieces sticking out of the build makes it look worse, you can’t deny that. I don’t mind a bit of exposed motor lock but a lot of exposed blocks on a good build can ruin it. Plus it’s a personal opinion whether the build is good enough.
creations-chat 2021-09-28 12:36:41 Damn bro roblox moderation actually ass, got banned for saying the word gay once. That actually sucks.
creations-chat 2021-09-28 14:38:07 Huh?
creations-chat 2021-09-28 14:40:29 It does show some of the building skill that went into the build, but I mean, it can sometimes ruin a build so agree. On the Yak I was mega-tripping it still looks balling.
creations-chat 2021-09-28 14:42:32 Also <@!739850757305532458> , what do you mean?
creations-chat 2021-09-28 14:46:58 I’m not sure what’s wrong with my elevators though?
creations-chat 2021-09-29 01:56:48 A day
creations-chat 2021-09-29 03:31:40 I swear there are these 2 dudes who downvote any creation they see.
creations-chat 2021-09-29 03:35:26 Yeah it’s the uh Print Screen, Cactus and Beeyow dudes, I did some digging.
creations-chat 2021-09-29 07:48:40 good or nah?
creations-chat 2021-09-29 07:51:55 
creations-chat 2021-09-29 07:59:20 Cleared up the front it was very hard to prevent exposed motors

creations-chat 2021-09-29 14:53:28 Good f22 I like the intakes, try to make the canopy smoother tho
creations-chat 2021-09-30 11:11:50 Good?

Is this better for a nose?
creations-chat 2021-09-30 11:23:31 What about this?
creations-chat 2021-09-30 11:43:43 I added an internal weapons bay.
creations-chat 2021-09-30 11:51:03 We do some decorating
creations-chat 2021-09-30 11:53:23 They aren't?
creations-chat 2021-09-30 12:00:18 I mean it is pretty thick, and the intakes are a bit hard as I can't angle lock without having exposed motors and more trouble.
creations-chat 2021-09-30 12:02:38 I can kinda replicate that but at this 1 block wide nose scale I can't do too much.
creations-chat 2021-09-30 12:06:02 I mean I personally think it looks alright, and it works well.
creations-chat 2021-09-30 12:10:04 Also is the internal weapons bay alright?
creations-chat 2021-09-30 12:12:23 Not really, it would collide with pieces of my motorlock tower. Also, new jet https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/758545164532056084/893108060783013908/unknown.png
creations-chat 2021-09-30 14:49:09 Should I post the f-35 in creations?

creations-chat 2021-09-30 15:33:00 Good memories.
creations-chat 2021-09-30 15:57:28 Joke
creations-chat 2021-09-30 16:05:17 Good build, very good build
creations-chat 2021-10-01 10:44:21 What intake looks better for the f22?
creations-chat 2021-10-01 11:48:16 How's it lookin so far?
creations-chat 2021-10-01 11:56:50 It won't once I've done the elevators
creations-chat 2021-10-01 11:59:34 I haven't done them, go to <#384021699466756107>  this slowmode annoying
creations-chat 2021-10-01 12:02:20 Less gap* between the main wing and elevators, and the elevators may need to be a bit bigger, other than that, maybe move the engine upwards as well as the stabiliser. Good job either way!
creations-chat 2021-10-01 12:25:42 Which side is better?
creations-chat 2021-10-01 12:27:57 Right better now?
creations-chat 2021-10-01 12:32:12 Perfecto?

creations-chat 2021-10-01 12:57:59 Tried very hard and used 6 motors to move them back but it didn't work well, and caused a bunch of exposed motors
creations-chat 2021-10-01 13:00:23 This is it 1 block back thought (Right)
creations-chat 2021-10-01 13:02:47 Thats the plan haha
creations-chat 2021-10-01 13:13:51 You posted? It's sad when you have to be that toxic because somebody cannot build as well as you, it takes another level of stupidity to not understand that people have different skills, and levels of what they think is good. It is hard for the "noobs" to improve when met with such a toxic attitude. Sure posting in creations gives you downvotes, but that is feedback, not utter rudeness. Everybody starts somewhere.
creations-chat 2021-10-01 13:17:56 Man I dislike people sometimes.
creations-chat 2021-10-01 13:20:10 Good Idea.
creations-chat 2021-10-01 14:45:27 🤓
creations-chat 2021-10-01 14:56:46 Yo got any feedback on my F-35 that I posted yesterday?
creations-chat 2021-10-02 06:50:48 🤓<:Downvote:490311668556103700>
creations-chat 2021-10-02 07:35:11 Proportions look alright?
creations-chat 2021-10-02 07:37:26 I mean it is supposed to be at a 1 block wide nose scale so is it reasonable?
creations-chat 2021-10-02 07:40:15 Uh they're not very good but uh they are 2 half wedge downs with some motorlocked wing panels.
creations-chat 2021-10-02 08:28:07 Could I see it?
creations-chat 2021-10-02 08:30:57 Yeah it looks really good apart from a few little motors. Awesome build.
creations-chat 2021-10-02 08:36:54 Does this warthog nose look alright?
creations-chat 2021-10-02 08:45:19 Any better? Nvm a10 can be for another day.
creations-chat 2021-10-02 08:59:52 exposed motors a lot of the time end up making a build hideous, only in some cases is it alright for the build
creations-chat 2021-10-02 09:02:13 not for you lol, your build is epic

creations-chat 2021-10-02 13:15:23 Good fuselage?

creations-chat 2021-10-03 06:33:52 Oh crap I just realised the cockpit isn't supposed to go up, but I'm trying to get some sort of access to the inside, as the rear is very very difficult to do.
creations-chat 2021-10-03 06:36:11 I'm going to try to get the rear to work but idk if it's going to be pretty
creations-chat 2021-10-03 06:46:04 Making a working back door is really really difficult, god help me.
creations-chat 2021-10-03 12:31:24 Does the side view look alright?
creations-chat 2021-10-03 12:33:41 That's pretty necessary because it moves.
creations-chat 2021-10-03 12:38:41 I think it looks alright, but I might extend it further.
creations-chat 2021-10-03 13:05:43 What type of engines should I use? Turboprop or Jet?
creations-chat 2021-10-03 13:55:52 Jump?

creations-chat 2021-10-04 05:26:39 Very nice.
creations-chat 2021-10-06 08:52:39 Su 34 is just obese nose Sukhoi plane
creations-chat 2021-10-06 08:56:21 Agreed,
creations-chat 2021-10-06 08:59:28 Yeh lacks detail, looks kinda basic, but it ain’t bad
creations-chat 2021-10-06 09:01:52 Yeah add details like lights and stuff seems pretty simple to do. WIP Project?
creations-chat 2021-10-06 09:06:46 What was the crappy plane you guys were talking about earlier? I don’t really see it anywhere.
Oh deleted.
creations-chat 2021-10-08 09:02:46 nice f22
creations-chat 2021-10-10 02:03:23 Make the tip of the nose a bit more bulbous, alr, still a good build
creations-chat 2021-10-10 02:05:59 The tail is off, I’m pretty sure the fuselage goes straight, not down at the tail
creations-chat 2021-10-10 02:08:25 Wait never mind, it goes down at the slightest angle, maybe try angle locking a piece?
creations-chat 2021-10-10 02:10:29 Angle lock a row of blocks and wedges to slope down at the back for a slight continuous slope.
creations-chat 2021-10-10 05:35:13 Smokestack is disproportionate, the details look out of place and incorrect, there is a lack of detail, and the colours also look off. If I’m going to be completely honest, I couldn’t recognise it as the picture whatsoever.
creations-chat 2021-10-10 05:49:47 Yeah no detail guns look off and generally looks bad
creations-chat 2021-10-10 05:54:12 Attach it to the top of a dusty Fed Ex van
creations-chat 2021-10-10 10:03:24 agreed, and I thought the plane looked bad with a good paintjob.
creations-chat 2021-10-10 10:49:00 make 1 block wide builds <:trollface:775024642104229898>

creations-chat 2021-10-10 11:45:31 the colour scheme looks like a nerf gun, it would be great camouflage in a Spiderman birthday party.
creations-chat 2021-10-10 11:48:00 but the build itself looks good ig
creations-chat 2021-10-11 10:38:43 Link the plane
creations-chat 2021-10-11 10:45:32 Also the boat looks very blocky and generally plain, so maybe make some improvements?
creations-chat 2021-10-11 12:11:49 That’s a very good ratio based on how the build looks.
creations-chat 2021-10-17 06:07:37 Can I get a hall of fame for 150 score?
creations-chat 2021-10-17 06:12:46 Yeah to be honest it might not be that great of a build
creations-chat 2021-10-17 06:46:03 I wish I had sparkler rn. Ugh this is so annoying.
creations-chat 2021-10-17 06:48:15 I could but I need it to be 2 blocks long without the bases on it
creations-chat 2021-10-17 06:57:35 You haven't seen my thicc custom battleship, have you? Your ship is godly in comparison.
creations-chat 2021-10-17 07:00:05 I'm working on it rn
creations-chat 2021-10-17 07:08:36 It's not going well.
creations-chat 2021-10-17 07:16:29 Do the turrets look alright other than paint?
creations-chat 2021-10-17 07:28:27 I'm basing it off a south dakota battleship, but I'm trying to modify it because of motorlocking issues and fatness.

creations-chat 2021-10-17 12:43:53 South dakota so far. The 2nd turret is wrong but who cares.

creations-chat 2021-10-17 15:02:07 More shaping to the feet, and maybe some trails and shapes here and there for detail, its a good build nonetheless but if you have intentions of posting it then you might need more detail for acceptance. **The back looks pretty solid, adding more stuff is up to you**

creations-chat 2021-10-25 10:31:07 Alright, thanks
creations-chat 2021-10-25 10:33:17 Sukhoi just mig 29 on a diet. Also it's hard to custom angle this nose as I need another angle lock on the exact same settings and the motors are too glitchy for both to say on the exact same level and angle. Like the entire nose is angle locked right, and to add a custom nose, I'd need a seperate angle lock.
creations-chat 2021-10-25 10:37:03 Yeah I can record a clip of this angle locking not working because the motors are so glitchy.
creations-chat 2021-10-25 10:39:35 ok it worked, looking good?
creations-chat 2021-10-25 10:47:52 Looking good? and also <@!682147422218223616>  that's looking pretty nice, idk about the cockpit and angle but maybe I've just got poor interpretation

creations-chat 2021-11-02 10:11:06 The upper part is essential, as it needs to be a uniform level due to the blend into slopes, it's difficult to understand but it offsets the paint by 0.25 blocks and usually makes it look a bit ugly.
creations-chat 2021-11-02 10:14:12 Also the lower part is very difficult as the turn sits in between 2 1x4 wedges that make the rear shape.

Low effort build with basically no motor lock got you does 5 and now you downvote anything you see.
creations-chat 2021-11-06 02:31:42 But you downvoted Lazar's tank which is clearly better than all of the builds you've posted combined?

creations-chat 2021-11-06 03:38:42 Canopy opens but can't close because the stupid seat blocks it

creations-chat 2021-11-07 11:07:31 A little bit of a reference, eh?

Reference because the nose looks kind of weird in my photos
creations-chat 2021-11-08 12:58:42 Ty man, and <@441939688018935818> it's alright, be proud of what you've done and fix it if you want, it all comes with practice and so far your f16 has a really really good canopy, I've never been able to do one like that.
creations-chat 2021-11-08 13:00:54 <:nooo:787097964946259978>
creations-chat 2021-11-09 07:09:45 <@719168864705052802> any reason for the downvote on my f16?
creations-chat 2021-11-09 07:14:30 I just want feedback for my plane, I tried my best to make it look good qnd I'd like to Improve on anything that seems wrong.
creations-chat 2021-11-09 07:54:46 Although hars has a lot better builds than me, I wonder why he downvoted my f-16? I don't see anything noticeably wrong with it, and it would be great if he told me what was wrong with it.
creations-chat 2021-11-09 08:00:37 I thought I basically added everything and no exposed motorlocks or pistons? maybe he just doesn't like the build or photos generally which is fine ig
creations-chat 2021-11-09 12:22:11 Thicker nose height or at least sloped at the bottom, as well as this, the intake looks very off, similarly with the cockpit, but you’ll get it right over time, no hate just keep working hard.
creations-chat 2021-11-09 12:27:31 Tutorial, it gonna get deleted
creations-chat 2021-11-09 21:25:32 Gap is meant to be there, I can’t overdo my engines without exposed motor lock, the half wedges connect to the fuselage almost perfectly, and the landing gear is literally implemented in the game so why not use it? I feel you’re nitpicking and downvoting anything that you see a slight gap in, plus everything you do and say is kinda pricky. You make good builds but you’re quite literally annoying for no reason.
creations-chat 2021-11-09 21:28:00 Yes but I think your opinion is incredibly harsh and unjust 😀

Reference for the gap, also calling my fuselage “fucked” is a bit off because it looks pretty accurate for the scale of my build.
creations-chat 2021-11-09 21:30:55 I worked my ass off at this scale, and you expect me to have the level of detail and perfection of a build 3 times the size, but if I try and have exposed motor lock you’ll still downvote?
creations-chat 2021-11-09 21:34:32 He does have the best planes, but I don’t like it when people start sending hate for the tiniest of things. If you try your best on something and you spend 3 nights getting the photos right, you won’t really like other people criticising the build for the smallest things. I wasn’t here when he called my build fucked. Hars I know you can do that, but you’re a lot better than me, I still don’t get how you downvotes for a slight gap and my use of a certain block.
creations-chat 2021-11-09 21:36:54 Plus I only have use of half wedges for the armaments, anything else looks awful, and motorlocking runs the risk of exposed motors and cramped space in my unloaded build.
creations-chat 2021-11-09 21:49:42 But half the stuff in the criticism is just nitpicking, the other half is actually supposed to be on the plane, and sutff that I really can't do at the scale, I'm just salty ig, but I'm also passionate about my build.
creations-chat 2021-11-09 21:51:47 Would be fine if he had a good reason, and some parts he did, but he went further to call my build "fucked" and was generally a bit rude which I didn't really like. i also don't believe that the things he mentioned should've lead to such a negative reaction, but he does him ig.
creations-chat 2021-11-09 21:56:21 It's like if I downvoted his good build for having an exposed motor head
creations-chat 2021-11-09 22:00:24 What
creations-chat 2021-11-09 22:10:15 It's not bullying, hars had a point but he was kinda annoying about it, and half the things he told me were shit were basically unable to be fixed without exposed motor
creations-chat 2021-11-09 22:13:27 He has but Im not hating for it, also you're just starting another argument you oddly shaped brainlet
creations-chat 2021-11-09 22:16:32 But every time you message you just continue it by calling my builds shit, not even mad at hars anymore, you need to 🤐. Also double as much as I respect you, please stop sucking hars' toes, I was just mad at him nitpicking and being a prick by calling my build shit and fucked, he was being a Simon  Cowell.
creations-chat 2021-11-10 06:36:22 finished crying to realise a lot of what hars said was true 😭

creations-chat 2021-11-13 07:00:29 Ah, yeah some half cylinder in front of the intake would look nice
creations-chat 2021-11-13 07:02:42 <@!401530469952389130> The body shape is all there, but you can do a lot better if you add more details here and there, because it looks kinda standard rn.
creations-chat 2021-11-13 07:08:07 make the brownish colour darker, also can I see the intake?
creations-chat 2021-11-13 07:14:57 Use half cylinder 2x2s down the bottom, and piston lock one half cyl 2x2 0.1 outwards and 0.3 upwards using pistons at the front to create the black part.

creations-chat 2021-11-13 16:09:43 Most 3 block wide noses look pretty bad
creations-chat 2021-11-14 00:44:14 Try to angle half wedges solely to sit alongside your wedge piece, or have the whole top portion angle locked half blocks and wedges.

creations-chat 2021-11-14 03:49:25 Yea, I'm gonna work on that now
creations-chat 2021-11-14 05:13:50 the spine needs to curve down a lot more, not be flat.
creations-chat 2021-11-14 05:21:43 yeah thats still curved a lot more than the build

creations-chat 2021-11-14 08:18:02 Hars is kinda mixed for me, I accept his feedback, it's good, and I've implemented it all, but sometimes he just comes off as rude and I get salty.
creations-chat 2021-11-14 08:27:07 Does the wing camo look aight?
creations-chat 2021-11-14 08:29:13 It's the Mitsubishi F-2. which is basically modified Japanese F-16 with different livery
creations-chat 2021-11-14 08:51:33 leave the intake grey?
creations-chat 2021-11-14 11:37:41 Paint armament blue?
creations-chat 2021-11-14 12:01:35 .it's flat and fat and the colours are kinda off, also, the ship needs to narrow down to a point towards the bottom and generally be more out of the water.
creations-chat 2021-11-14 12:07:23 nose is short and stubby, the intakes are too square and small with no pointy thing, and the cockpit shouldn't be on that level where it's submerged below the angle of the nose.

creations-chat 2021-11-15 07:10:57 Incorrect, your builds are epic, and I remember that clip of one of your builds being the smoothest flying planes I've ever seen.
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/384025409945337856/906756122235506708/unknown.png

This Falken looks crazy impressive at this scale

Yeah a clip of your plane flying really really well.
creations-chat 2021-11-15 07:14:10 Take your time, I think it'll turn out really well, plus it's smooth asf.
creations-chat 2021-11-15 07:25:32 Does black cockpit look alright?
creations-chat 2021-11-15 07:29:29 is the last one edited using image formatting, specifically "artistic effects" from Microsoft Powerpoint 2016?

creations-chat 2021-11-15 08:20:08 Should I make a scenic environment for the F-2 to be parked in?
creations-chat 2021-11-15 09:58:52 oh damn
creations-chat 2021-11-15 10:11:03 Added gear doors and intake details, does it look overdone or overdetailed?

creations-chat 2021-11-20 10:33:25 Wings are understandable but the nose is slanted, its just not too slanted because it obstructs my intake.

creations-chat 2021-11-20 11:07:08 <@!629858706997248000> What should I fix up?
creations-chat 2021-11-20 11:11:25 Bruh that's literally detail, the trails on the nose are found on the actual aircraft, as well as the wing trails and grey lines, same with the elevator and grey on the fuselage. The red in front of the stabiliser is intentional and used as detail for my build.
creations-chat 2021-11-20 11:14:49 You can see there are grey lines on the fuselage and I extended the grey outline easily seen at the back and on the middle segment, the grey shape on the top of the fuselage can also be seen. Sorry my exhaust looks a bit blocky, I can't really fix that,

creations-chat 2021-12-12 05:41:25 Here, as you can see there are 2 small fins on the front slope of the rudder, and on the downward slope of the cockpit's connection to the spine. There is also a small red detail, being a light on the left side of the intake. As well as this, there is a small black strip protruding from the front of the wing. Other decals are easily noticeable and I just spam them in. Spam = good

Yes its very true, many other issues like the nose and paint, and there is no thrust vectoring
creations-chat 2021-12-13 12:18:18 True, it’s almost 3 months old now and it’s basically my 2nd motorlocked build.

It was also made horribly at the start and it caused many many issues when I worked on improving it due to the underlying problems that I couldn’t fix. My bad for the crappy build 🙁

creations-chat 2021-12-16 05:10:24 Don't think an f105 is possible at that scale, you'd have to motorlock a custom angle for the slope
creations-chat 2021-12-16 05:13:52 I mean for the slope of the nose making it longer
creations-chat 2021-12-16 05:41:21 Why does this spine always look so off

creations-chat 2021-12-16 06:34:55 I angled it custom and it looked a bit like this

creations-chat 2021-12-16 06:38:48 Yes that was my issue, trying to get the spine to sit below the spine without it looking comical when I blend the noticeable gap between the end of the canopy and the spine
creations-chat 2021-12-16 06:43:33 https://discordapp.com/channels/384021699466756103/504436696021204992/920917508716900382

Like this blend, I'm trying to get the canopy to slope down further but It's not working too well with the space I have. Alright, thanks, I'll try to work on it with the advice you've given.

creations-chat 2021-12-20 11:21:18 Canopy opens, not sure if I should keep this cause it needs a bunch of space inside the build and cockpit to work.

creations-chat 2021-12-20 14:05:38 how long is your f-15?

nvm that's tedious to find out
creations-chat 2021-12-21 03:37:56 Too much exposed motorlock and the camo looks a bit strange. no offense
creations-chat 2021-12-21 03:39:58 I see, but that would also be just as simple to do using signs with a blue square or circle. Still a nice build
creations-chat 2021-12-21 03:43:58 I hate noobs <@447221768520859659> 🤮 🤮 🤢

creations-chat 2022-01-03 04:04:07 I've basically almost kinda done the engines, what do you think?
creations-chat 2022-01-03 04:19:05 decent but simple and underdetailed
creations-chat 2022-01-03 04:26:00 any better <@!723940197456281640> ?
creations-chat 2022-01-03 04:30:17 if I made the intakes higher up it would look worse, and if I made them any shorter they would be comically bad

oh wait I realise the mistake I made, I added blocks underneath experimentally 🤦‍♂️
creations-chat 2022-01-03 04:33:44 to make my build look decent, I would have to move the engines up 0.5 blocks but that also looked bad

what i do

creations-chat 2022-01-03 04:43:38 anime is for nerds
creations-chat 2022-01-03 07:53:29 the fear of abandonment and the fear found in many liminal spaces derives from the feel of a completely habitable and regular, while perhaps vintage or old place having absolutely nothing at all (like humans and stuff). thats why the backrooms and shit like that is so scary

i feel like the kitchen would be scary if it was like nuketown style

creations-chat 2022-01-06 13:53:41 maybe the shadows just make them look small, I'd go for 2 blocks wide for the engines so 1 block wrapped with halfblocks

ok they're probably right then. yes colour and shadows

creations-chat 2022-01-12 15:55:54 I hoped it would, I was going for something inspired by the k2 and leopard variants

<@456226577798135808> cheers mate
creations-chat 2022-01-12 16:03:56 <@!473580489337339914> yo, what should I fix up on my build? 🛠️
creations-chat 2022-01-12 16:06:25 understandable, but it is kinda hard to make 1 block wide tracks, have them work, and still have it look pleasing and not ruin features I want to add in the rest of the build.
creations-chat 2022-01-12 16:08:33 Possible and possible without ruining the build, creating disproportions and issues is very distant.
creations-chat 2022-01-12 16:11:10 Plus, I'm trying not to overcomplicate my builds, my builds usually only consist 1 motor tower and I'd like to keep it that simple and easy to modify and work with.

Also the barrel hole is quite hard as when I remove the bases of the sparklers, it removes the decal on the front automatically, and there is no way to add a text block onto the front of the sparkler? 🤷‍♂️
creations-chat 2022-01-12 16:16:01 I thought you meant the hole in the front of the barrel 🤷‍♂️ 

I don't have easily accessible space to create another completely identical turret system, especially with a locked motor bringing the sparklers in, it would make my turret look pretty much hideous at the base.


I have one block inside the turret that I use for the elevation motor, how tf do I fit another motor in 1 block of space without glitching it out?
ok good talk
creations-chat 2022-01-12 16:19:42 I meant I have a single motor, in a single block of open space that means it doesn't glitch out, right?
This motor moves the gun up and down.
I can't fit another motor in the 1 block of open space that my elevation motor sits in?
creations-chat 2022-01-12 16:25:45 so what else i fix
creations-chat 2022-01-12 16:32:11 yes sides kinda bad, idk about colours i thought they were kinda spicy u know, what colours should I go for?
creations-chat 2022-01-12 16:34:30 Yeah less saturated agree, I tried to make it dark enough for a forest, but it's kinda neither light or dark enough for anything, will fix perhaps
creations-chat 2022-01-12 16:41:44 <@!719168864705052802> feedback would be appreciated i guess
creations-chat 2022-01-12 16:44:46 yes I used the same green in different shades maybe next time I'll do a camo of some sort, not sure about the barrel, it seemed alright but I might improve it and add back some features
creations-chat 2022-01-12 16:59:41 what should I do with this?
creations-chat 2022-01-12 17:02:30 
creations-chat 2022-01-12 17:06:02 yeah

creations-chat 2022-01-13 04:13:04 A furry makes a good build

creations-chat 2022-01-13 04:15:50 In another server lmfao, and you treat them worse than straight people who do the same???
If they don't affect you personally, then don't hate on them for no reason. That's just childish
creations-chat 2022-01-13 04:19:10 For sure.
creations-chat 2022-01-13 04:21:19 Straight people that arent furries dox too 🤦

creations-chat 2022-01-13 04:27:32 If you hate on somebody or a group because they have a connection in hobbies to a person who treated you wrong. Get a life lol
creations-chat 2022-01-13 04:31:14 Youre treating this like only furries doxx, plus they were a different person. Just treat people the same and if they do something to you, its not always associated with them being a furry. You need to chill man.

creations-chat 2022-01-13 10:24:04 is it bad?
creations-chat 2022-01-13 10:26:30 fixed the vertical stabiliser
creations-chat 2022-01-13 10:36:11 It's already pretty fat. Keep in mind it is designed to be a mass produced f-35 successor, and isn't supposed to be as advanced as an f-22, though close. Hence why it has 1 engine and is a lot smaller than the f-22
creations-chat 2022-01-13 10:38:52 it's a f-35 successor, kinda a combination of both f22 and 35

creations-chat 2022-01-13 14:00:03 does this look better for the nose?
creations-chat 2022-01-13 14:14:26 yes it was i made bigger !
creations-chat 2022-01-13 15:39:07 Honest feedback:
|| it looks almost nothing like an m1a2 ||

Positive feedback:
|| not much, I guess the front looks okay.||
creations-chat 2022-01-13 15:41:53 If it’s that troublesome to redo the turret, I would personally restart.
creations-chat 2022-01-13 15:44:23 It looks like a Soviet destroyer or some sort of artillery idk.
creations-chat 2022-01-13 15:48:00 Make the nose more defined i guess.

creations-chat 2022-01-13 17:11:31 Noted, this was somewhat an experimental build, and I’m learning to build it this size and style, I will definitely put this towards my next jet.

creations-chat 2022-01-14 08:59:06 Anything really, super jets usually
creations-chat 2022-01-14 09:12:19 1 Block wide working tracks are hard enough to do and fit into a build, it is close to impossible to make them look good and function.
creations-chat 2022-01-14 09:16:43 2 block wide works but tbh it isn't that appealing to look at, also needs quite a large tank to work in and look proportionate in, you usually see them in bigger tanks.
creations-chat 2022-01-14 09:54:06 good build but it seems a bit stubby and the engines seem a bit small
creations-chat 2022-01-14 10:00:05 i wasnt here when vulpen posted that but his is also a bit disproportionate.
creations-chat 2022-01-14 10:23:14 Positive feedback:
|| build is smooth, good colours ||

Honest Feedback:

|| Pretty good build, but the proportions of the canopy and other features make it look a bit stubby, engines seem small but that might just be camera angle ||

What you do with the build is up to you

creations-chat 2022-01-14 15:36:31 It's a custom design, also front pic:

creations-chat 2022-01-14 15:45:48 All angles, what's up with it? It's only around 2 full motorlock towers entirely.
creations-chat 2022-01-14 15:51:40 perfect
It's supposed to be for the army, so you can expect some prankster to decorate it.
creations-chat 2022-01-14 15:54:17 ill fix it up

creations-chat 2022-01-14 16:05:52 if you mean the main gun yes, the 50 cal thing no
creations-chat 2022-01-14 16:08:07 cameras, a lot of cameras
creations-chat 2022-01-14 16:10:54 This is build mode, also press 1 to go to your normal view instead of going through 300 cameras

I start by making the base of the turret with normal blocks and angling, then I move onto detailing and try to paint last (unless you suck at camo like me)
creations-chat 2022-01-14 16:30:06 fixed the colour variation issues (mostly) and ill tackle the rest, I dont want to make it too beat up because it is a very modern tank
creations-chat 2022-01-14 16:55:28 fair but the space around my tracks is kinda limited so 🤷‍♂️
creations-chat 2022-01-14 17:04:20 I meant space to add stuff to the wheels and tracks, I can paint for sure
creations-chat 2022-01-14 17:07:00 I can't fit text signs on the majority of the wheels, its very tightly packed
I may be able to do some motorlocking magic on a seperate tower though
creations-chat 2022-01-14 17:09:24 Yep.
creations-chat 2022-01-14 17:37:19 <@719168864705052802> Wow you downvoted my build mass downvoter 😡😡😡😡

creations-chat 2022-01-14 17:39:57 Imagine if there wasn't a massive build in HOF
creations-chat 2022-01-14 17:41:59 Looks bad compared to the real one
creations-chat 2022-01-14 17:44:37 How to get into HOF
Make a very large build.
I wish smaller builds were easier to get into hof
creations-chat 2022-01-14 17:47:26 The hornet looks good for a build but not exceptional
Remove the T72 as well. Although it is old it is below average IMO
creations-chat 2022-01-14 17:50:07 I don't like how the t72 looks in general. Tiny blocky turret with a long ass gun on a flat hull.
creations-chat 2022-01-14 17:52:08 Its accurate and put together but its not awesome. I think mko has better builds that are more sensible for hof
creations-chat 2022-01-14 17:54:30 Imagine F2 in creations (joke)
Ive posted it too many times

What about in HoF tho?

Does this seem good enough for a new standards hof build?
creations-chat 2022-01-14 18:00:49 I hate making big builds, but should I try to add more to that build or? I want it to have a chance because I don't have the motive to create another somewhat good build. But if I add more it will probably look bad and unrealistic.
creations-chat 2022-01-14 18:03:06 Why tf am I hungry asf, can somebody find that pic of the hornet created in entirely motorlock.
creations-chat 2022-01-14 18:06:54 Most of my builds only have 1-2 towers. Motorlocking is bad ew

I don't want to be like that, but I had like 20 angle locks and 25 piston locks on my plane 👨‍❤️‍👨

creations-chat 2022-01-15 11:51:36 Which is better?
creations-chat 2022-01-15 11:56:57 I don't like 2 tbh, there is a massive gap above the wheels and it looks bad.
Also 1 seems more realistic?
Thoughts?
creations-chat 2022-01-15 12:21:34 Is it alright to delete a creation with lots of reactions because you do not like the way it looks, and it has already been posted before with minimal differences, not to mention I want to post the build again with many new changes later?
I feel like I've reposted it and it looks ugly.
creations-chat 2022-01-15 12:24:07 I don't want to be that gronk that posts 20 pictures of my build.
creations-chat 2022-01-15 12:43:21 I can't, I'm physically unable to have elevation if I try. My motor is under the red circle and there is no space to have a motor locking blocks half back. Also whenever I try to have phased blocks in my gun it spazzes out.

the rest will be fixed
You reckon the barrel would look worse with gaps than it would with sparkler bases?
removing the fard trails
creations-chat 2022-01-16 11:30:18 I've tried a ton to fix the mantlet, should I instead have a barrel that is unable to elevate or "depress"? ( i don't know terminology)
I don't think it's possible to have a good looking manlet or barrel at this scale with the conditions I have.
creations-chat 2022-01-16 11:36:31 Ok, I got it.
Reply with 1 if I should have a moving gun (up and down) with gaps, an ugly mantlet, and ugly turret in general.
Reply with 2 if I should have a non-moving gun with no gaps, an appealing gun and mantlet.
creations-chat 2022-01-16 11:39:36 I got no pvp capability especially with motorlocked angles lmfao
creations-chat 2022-01-16 12:21:04 Top 10 most comfortable seats.
creations-chat 2022-01-16 14:53:08 So should I remove vertical gun movement for a batter barrel and mantlet?
creations-chat 2022-01-16 15:37:31 Personally, I see a fat flying black brick.

creations-chat 2022-01-17 13:47:14 Does the cupola look better?
creations-chat 2022-01-17 14:01:31 Not if you don't want gaps in the barrel and a bad mantlet and detailing.
creations-chat 2022-01-17 14:05:08 ok bro, there aren't that many decals hiding the tank, I think you need glasses.
creations-chat 2022-01-17 14:11:39 Well you'd really think a motorlocked tank designed to look good should pvp?
you should also consider the many complaints about lack of detail and looks, even gaps when I had a working turret.
And yes, in this case I am prioritising it.
creations-chat 2022-01-17 14:14:57 Well that opinion serves as somewhat useless when it comes to making a good looking build to post in PCC. 

Also <@!441939688018935818> is right, what is a moving turret that doesn't affect pvp capability going to do for me?
The turret spins, and I've maintained a level of visual appeal in the build and that is enough.
creations-chat 2022-01-17 14:17:12 I could easily revert to a functional gun that moves up and down, but it looks bad and I don't want to.
Not only is it difficult to have it at this scale, there are many other circumstances that limit my build if I have a working barrel.
creations-chat 2022-01-17 17:21:22 Not really? It doesn't seem cluttered or overdetailed? To be fair it looks a lot cleaner than some of your builds?
creations-chat 2022-01-18 06:01:11 what is the somewhat ok build in this case?
creations-chat 2022-01-18 06:04:16 I experience that a lot, especially when I post a few worse angles compared to a few good angles, sometimes the worse ones do better no matter just because of spikes.
Also gotta account for the pissyshit downvoter.

This was my first boat, and it was made before I had sparklers, I've upgraded it slightly since I posted it, but I'm too lazy to record a video and apply for expert shipwright.

creations-chat 2022-01-18 06:09:16 
creations-chat 2022-01-18 06:11:43 I added a bunch of tiny details and filled the entire hull to get 4000 blocks and I'm still too lazy to apply
creations-chat 2022-01-18 06:57:26 if its big it will get into hof, if it is small it has no chance, or so I've learnt
creations-chat 2022-01-18 07:12:34 It has a lot to do with size, the bigger it is the more "impressive" it is. Plus the 1 smaller jet in HOF is agreed shouldn't be in there anyway. If you make a tiny creation with a bunch of detail, it is a lot harder to get into HOF than an enormous arctic explorer.
creations-chat 2022-01-18 07:17:51 the past 7 HOF builds are all plot sized or larger, now are there any 1 block wide jets in there? Hars' jet is quite large to be honest, and the f-18 is pretty random to see in HOF because it isn't the best 2 block wide jet in creations, not even from MKO.
creations-chat 2022-01-18 09:52:46 Add more detail, change the colours to not be completely grey, change the horrible material choice, the windows are too bright blue. 
Rn the build looks horribly plain and basic, but it could turn out pretty good if you work on it more.

nvm the spine throwing me off
creations-chat 2022-01-22 09:29:00 just make the nose shorter
creations-chat 2022-01-22 11:06:14 Both builds are impressive.
creations-chat 2022-01-22 11:13:10 Well its realistic?
creations-chat 2022-01-22 11:22:49 This look like a broken house?
creations-chat 2022-01-22 11:28:32 cheers, also working on the house mess.

creations-chat 2022-01-22 11:42:36 working on it
creations-chat 2022-01-22 11:47:32 good job
creations-chat 2022-01-22 11:52:38 This look like a decent broken tree to you?
creations-chat 2022-01-22 12:27:48 does it look better?
creations-chat 2022-01-22 12:34:50 Perhaps different angles?
creations-chat 2022-01-22 12:37:40 I'm removing some of the random clutter, perhaps that would make it look a bit better
creations-chat 2022-01-22 12:40:17 With clutter reduction
Wait <@!702907851001167882> , do you mean the ones with leaves or the broken ones?
creations-chat 2022-01-22 12:52:00 on it
creations-chat 2022-01-22 13:06:50 Does this look better?

creations-chat 2022-01-22 14:02:41 would've done better without the reference anyway
creations-chat 2022-01-22 14:23:22 I want the big trees though

Chernobyl MUTANT TREES!
theyre alive!!!1!!1
creations-chat 2022-01-22 14:25:49 I made them that size because if they are made smaller, it's hard to make them look good whatsoever.
Also, does this shot look alright?
creations-chat 2022-01-22 14:38:01 It's alright, just hit me up when you're able to and we can work on some good looking trees together.

<@!410455661814480896> <:4Weird:709084058721714324>
creations-chat 2022-01-22 14:43:32 Yep, comes with turret rotation too.
creations-chat 2022-01-22 14:45:53 Well, my piston helping the rotation struggles, but if you retry the piston pushing multiple times while the torque is maxed, it might work.
creations-chat 2022-01-22 15:32:36 new trees?
creations-chat 2022-01-22 15:47:30 Do the smaller trees improve it?
creations-chat 2022-01-22 15:52:47 noted, although, it is pretty intentional
creations-chat 2022-01-22 15:56:46 It's possible, but I think it wouldn't look very full.
creations-chat 2022-01-22 16:04:50 my guy, you're wasting your time, go write about it in suggestions for the minimal chance that they'll add something like that. This is a building game not an FPS game. Go play call of duty or smth

creations-chat 2022-01-22 16:25:56 <@!347182144873037824> That's a sick tank, are you able to use working tracks on it?
creations-chat 2022-01-22 16:37:34 the sneaky top view
not sure if the tank sticks out enough
creations-chat 2022-01-22 16:45:32 trees are supposed to be pretty big
creations-chat 2022-01-22 16:48:57 If I made them smaller it would look alright but when I work with half blocks things tend to be blocky without triangle wedges.
creations-chat 2022-01-22 16:53:55 My build isn’t motor locked and I do not plan for it to be.

How tf did this get upvotes entirely.
creations-chat 2022-01-23 07:12:41 Thoughts so far? Obviously nowhere near completion
creations-chat 2022-01-23 07:14:43 Elevators aren't as steeply angled as they should be, there isn't enough gap between the wings and elevators, engine placement seems to be off, and the spine could be longer. I would also lock a 1x4 wing panel into the front of the wings to give the slight curve that it needs.
creations-chat 2022-01-23 07:16:49 Sounds good, keep working and it'll turn out great.
creations-chat 2022-01-23 07:24:08 Looks basic, generic, and has little to no detail
Seems relatively blocky and some colours are gross.
creations-chat 2022-01-23 07:28:18 The pastel blue makes it look a bit off.
On the jet engines, that is.
creations-chat 2022-01-23 07:30:48 Do you think this desert/bush colour scheme looks alright?

creations-chat 2022-01-23 12:33:22 What camo and diorama theme should I have lastly.
Currently I have a Ukrainian Warzone (Forest) diorama and an Afghanistan War (Desert) diorama.
What's next?
creations-chat 2022-01-23 12:35:49 That seems a bit similar to the Afghanistan Diorama?
creations-chat 2022-01-23 12:38:03 Would be cool but I have a similar forest theme and my tank is a modern MBT, and I'm not sure if it would really belong there.
creations-chat 2022-01-23 12:44:52 Perhaps I will go for an arctic camo.
creations-chat 2022-01-23 13:26:13 How does the arctic themed hull look?
Ignore just about everything else, it's glitched.

Which is your favourite?
creations-chat 2022-01-23 13:59:42 wow, hars approval

I feel motivated now
creations-chat 2022-01-23 14:01:49 Would it still classify as a single creation if I included 3 dioramas and camos?
creations-chat 2022-01-23 14:13:50 if you have a block of empty space in your build, you can fit a motor and connect it to a panel that sits flush with your fuselage using text blocks.
I think that's what you're currently doing, so you might just be able to make it longer?
If you can't you may need to shorten the engine things.
creations-chat 2022-01-23 14:16:39 Ignore everything I said, apart from shorten the engine things whatever they may be called.
creations-chat 2022-01-23 14:19:31 Maybe try using a half ball to make the connection to the fuselage?
creations-chat 2022-01-23 15:46:09 Good enough for me.

<@!719168864705052802> what should I improve about the tank entirely?
Perhaps some difference in general detail across the tanks?
creations-chat 2022-01-23 15:51:02 I could make it wider, but that just changes the scale of the build entirely, and I’d much rather have it be a tall tank, adds more to it imo.

If you can see anything really off about the hull, just ping me about it and I’ll work on fixing it tomorrow.
creations-chat 2022-01-23 16:22:11 What are your thoughts on this scene?
creations-chat 2022-01-23 16:24:28 I'll add more detail, but I'm not sure if it would ruin the general aesthetic of emptiness and lifelessness.

What type of detail would look good?
creations-chat 2022-01-23 16:35:59 going to have to make another identical tank because the builds look empty

creations-chat 2022-01-24 10:20:35 cockpit is a bit too blocky and the nose looks a bit off, nose also looks like a giant beam
creations-chat 2022-01-24 10:41:04 alright, it seems like a great canvas for you to do some really good stuff.
creations-chat 2022-01-24 10:44:42 I dig the camo, but maybe make the patches of colours bigger, or like larger stripes of colour.

creations-chat 2022-01-24 11:27:33 its not mass downvoting, it's just that all the builds are ass
creations-chat 2022-01-24 12:15:43 However it looks nothing like how it does in real life.
Or what was shown in the reference image, anyway.
creations-chat 2022-01-24 12:30:02 Engines are too bright, the build lacks detail and is rather generic and common.
The nose is much too sharp.
Also add custom engines if you want it to look better.
creations-chat 2022-01-24 12:32:05 Because with no curvature inwards it looks quite comical, and duck-like. Also fix the rudders and engines.
creations-chat 2022-01-24 12:47:06 Either the angle or the rudders are way off

creations-chat 2022-01-27 06:57:46 fair, I'm doing another one that should be a bit different
creations-chat 2022-01-27 12:44:48 I mean, although it is harder, master supremes and whatnots have more experience in building, most of the time. Wouldn’t this make them more eligible for determining if the builds are worth?

Contest winners need to make a good build that gets a lot of upvotes. This can be a meme build or anything. However most master ranks require HOF submission and high block counts, as well as Staff approval.
creations-chat 2022-01-27 12:52:59 Yeah expert supreme may not deserve it, but master ranked players should *in my opinion* I suck at understanding sarcasm so excuse me for doing something stupid lol.

creations-chat 2022-01-29 16:06:09 thanks
creations-chat 2022-01-29 16:17:53 intentional, used for detail, meant to put it there, no motor exposure 😅
creations-chat 2022-01-29 16:28:36 I hope not :(
creations-chat 2022-01-31 06:38:33 <@!595188515084566529> 
mediocre build with cheese grater wings and a bad use of editing and photo angles.
creations-chat 2022-01-31 06:42:07 Not plane crazy, its just a lack of skill
creations-chat 2022-01-31 07:47:50 you should make the super hornet, the intakes are generally easier because with smoke things it looks a tad small
creations-chat 2022-01-31 10:38:56 No that angle is definitely steeper than 1x1 delta wings but not as steep as 1x2s 💀
creations-chat 2022-02-02 10:13:38 The locking on the wings looks kinda bad, same with the curvature at the front of the wing whatever it may be called.
creations-chat 2022-02-02 11:19:40 thoughts on the 2 new vehicles?
creations-chat 2022-02-02 11:24:03 rip your builds suck anyway so point disproven

<@!714878625484243101> Yeah sure, but they always turn up ugly in pictures, I'll try to turn down the colour.
creations-chat 2022-02-02 11:26:10 👍
creations-chat 2022-02-02 12:05:10 cool but the tanks are kinda ugly
creations-chat 2022-02-02 12:07:17 not really the camo, most tanks at that scale just look ugly, it's not easy to fix
creations-chat 2022-02-02 12:10:11 i mean it can sometimes be pulled off kinda well but most tanks smaller than roscale look shit
creations-chat 2022-02-02 12:15:52 most ww2 tanks are a lot easier to do in roscale, but like
creations-chat 2022-02-02 12:18:20 make your next sukhoi 6 wide nose
creations-chat 2022-02-02 12:21:21 not making a roscale build or mini builds and making a differently sized build is like taking a good piss

creations-chat 2022-02-04 14:50:46 Build itself lacks detail, the paint job isn’t very good, and it’s well, too simple.
creations-chat 2022-02-05 00:32:36 You should make large builds <:trollface:775024642104229898> 

Your T-72 is pretty epic


<@!765318482753224704> nothing is even going on, you got me laughing so hard 😐
creations-chat 2022-02-05 04:10:34 Exposed motor lock needs fixing.
creations-chat 2022-02-05 04:14:36 Wait what is the build? Also I was joking about it being in build mode.
creations-chat 2022-02-05 04:19:21 Looks good
creations-chat 2022-02-05 04:43:24 Tutorials shouldn’t have motor lock. Not only does it allow undes to flex a somewhat decent build but people will click off if the build is too difficult for them or too long.
creations-chat 2022-02-05 04:45:34 What

Unde sees large motor lock build on thumbnail
Not a modern fighter jet or b22
Unde does not click 
You are sad
No subs or views.
creations-chat 2022-02-05 04:48:11 What 😐
creations-chat 2022-02-05 04:50:39 Just post a shitty f22 click bait tutorial and it’s a win win.

Undes flex bad builds that people realise are trash
You get views and whatever.

No point to making a motor locked ww2 bomber because they won’t click and the ones that do have something good to flex.

creations-chat 2022-02-05 09:19:49 i would make the intake deeper


send me more angles

creations-chat 2022-02-05 10:52:49 <@!747811503591129170> The kfir looks good but the intakes are kinda small and they look a bit squished, and maybe you could make the nose longer?
creations-chat 2022-02-05 10:55:42 I think 2 should do for the nose, the rest seems good
creations-chat 2022-02-05 10:59:05 Yeah the nose is always really long and pointy on mirages.

creations-chat 2022-02-05 15:54:17 Ty a lot for taking your time to help me out. I'll be sure to work on the things you mentioned and get back to you in the morning. 👍
creations-chat 2022-02-05 15:57:09 Thanks to all the positive feedback from others as well. Last question is, should I have half block thick wings or regular? I suppose regular would be more manageable and customiseable.
creations-chat 2022-02-06 03:11:46 Are you still making the mirage? Also the nose is kinda smoothn’t.
creations-chat 2022-02-06 03:38:24 k
creations-chat 2022-02-06 04:29:04 Elevators complete with leading and whatever edges.
creations-chat 2022-02-06 04:34:58 I used 2 shades, there is a certain range of colours that mimic metallic effect, they're like pastel but darker if yk what I mean.
creations-chat 2022-02-06 06:44:01 When you have a 2000 block build that has excessive motorlocking in the fuselage and weight imbalances, AND it is created only to be used for looks, there is no real need for everything to function. To make it function is basically making it look ugly.
creations-chat 2022-02-06 06:51:06 I'm not going to use it for pvp?
creations-chat 2022-02-06 07:01:32 Its 2 seperately angle locked parts, and the both go into the fuselage to make it look flush, how do you expect me to have function anyway.
creations-chat 2022-02-06 07:03:54 Also, completed the wings.
creations-chat 2022-02-06 07:06:35 I kinda like it this size tho?
not sure about it
creations-chat 2022-02-06 07:09:04 Supposed to be a successor to the f1/2 being an "F-3"

Wings are supposed to be smaller and different to the f1
creations-chat 2022-02-06 07:13:52 Also my wings help simulate the intakes initially going back into the main body.
creations-chat 2022-02-06 08:57:00 dw adding more later
creations-chat 2022-02-06 11:47:27 although the intakes do slope in a continuous angle after a few blocks, I will add more detail. not sure how I would be able to improve the exhaust nozzle as it seems decent enough.
creations-chat 2022-02-06 11:57:06 I gotchu, with the bumps, it's just to try to stop gaps and stuff, but I'll work on fixing it now.
creations-chat 2022-02-06 12:17:41 poopy account

creations-chat 2022-02-06 12:27:51 im not removing that <@!719168864705052802> 

also do I add armament?
creations-chat 2022-02-06 12:36:48 Not entirely sure.
creations-chat 2022-02-06 12:43:06 Wing undersides, I'll work on hardpoints and armament tomorrow.
creations-chat 2022-02-06 14:14:34 Making the statement that every expert is so horrible, evil, and rude makes me want to downvote your builds 😐
creations-chat 2022-02-06 14:23:26 I’d be happy upvoting any good build made by you, but when you start banging along with the stereotype telling people that ALL experts are so evil!! It’s just stupid. Now I will have no remorse when I tell you to cope and build better, and stop crying, using the bland stereotype whenever somebody critiques your build.
creations-chat 2022-02-06 14:26:22 That’s sick, but is there any way to replace the guns used for the barrel?
creations-chat 2022-02-07 12:11:08 Armament done
creations-chat 2022-02-07 12:13:46 I'm doing a photoshoot with him, the inspired plane is similar anyway. There are also a huge number of differences between builds.

creations-chat 2022-02-07 12:35:42 Top one isn't mine lol, thats seyos.
creations-chat 2022-02-07 12:44:02 Ah ty, but seyos jet is what inspired me and his is very good. Personally I think both are good in different ways.
creations-chat 2022-02-07 12:56:54 Not sure, but I'm trying to make the build mode as concise as possible
creations-chat 2022-02-07 13:03:58 Canopy front is too steep, the intake is too far back.
creations-chat 2022-02-07 21:21:47 Canopy is too thin and some parts of the fuselage are smoothn’t. If you could fix that it would be good. Armament below the plane looks a bit out of place without anything on the wings, hard points could also look pretty nice.

<@!723940197456281640> Where to?
creations-chat 2022-02-08 11:23:20 but that fuel tank is a funny one!!

perhaps under the intakes?
or just one intake for that matter
creations-chat 2022-02-08 11:28:23 why move them around if I may ask
creations-chat 2022-02-08 11:35:47 also i can just replace the missile thing with a gunpod
creations-chat 2022-02-08 11:37:48 going to be honest, it's going to be such a goddamn pain to move them because they have 3 seperate motorlocked parts for each and I have to replace every one of them into the right spot.
creations-chat 2022-02-08 11:40:40 good, because the rocket pod is the only one that doesn't have any motorlocked parts <:pain:644301805534183464>
creations-chat 2022-02-08 11:42:43 Because I added some details and pylons to them and added blocks to where I cannot fit them on the main layer.

They look cool on the end anyway, plus downbending and stuff.
creations-chat 2022-02-08 11:45:55 This thing got way too messy way too fast, I'm not bothered to change the location of my drop tanks
creations-chat 2022-02-08 11:56:12 Yeah sorry bout that, I might feel motivated to do it some other time but for now it’s gonna stay like that. Is it a large issue from your perspective?
creations-chat 2022-02-09 07:23:15 The gun, materials and general details and features can be improved
creations-chat 2022-02-09 10:20:42 not only are your colours too saturated for that, but using the corroded metal doesn't look very realistic to be honest
creations-chat 2022-02-09 10:47:03 nah most furries are cringe

also little new things
creations-chat 2022-02-09 11:33:10 not sure 🤷‍♂️
creations-chat 2022-02-09 11:44:52 not enough space for a good looking gear set and it might make it smoothn't
creations-chat 2022-02-12 05:56:28 engine piece still looks sus and the body of it is kinda sus

and rudders
creations-chat 2022-02-12 06:01:34 they're not really connected to the fuselage, is the problem
creations-chat 2022-02-17 09:35:41 intake looks rather small and the nose is improvable.
bot-central 2022-02-17 10:03:51 -servers
creations-chat 2022-02-18 23:14:03 Canopy protrudes a ton and the spine looks kinda bad.

Nose slope also looks uneven and choppy.

probably just make everything a ton lower

creations-chat 2022-02-20 10:33:27 It isn’t really,.
creations-chat 2022-02-21 10:49:32 should I add/keep this?
creations-chat 2022-02-21 11:41:12 What is bad about the build?
creations-chat 2022-02-21 12:19:04 all vehicles on 1 account, and diorama on the other since I hit the build height limit.
creations-chat 2022-02-21 12:21:19 Hard to please somebody who can’t meet their own standards 😩
creations-chat 2022-02-21 12:26:52 Telling everybody that their builds are shit, still waiting for you to build something to the standard that you paint.
creations-chat 2022-02-21 12:29:18 I mean, if you claim to be so distant from pc, why are you still in this server, better yet, why are you still active and eager to express your unachievable standard?
creations-chat 2022-02-21 12:37:52 Just seems a tad stupid right? Somebody who doesn’t play the game, and judges based on an excessive standard in which they cannot reach takes the time to negatively criticise builds?
Seems like the only thing you get from this is attention.

also <@!657846484397719553> if it's too difficult, restarting on a stronger foundation may be the best option.

creations-chat 2022-02-24 12:15:18 guns
creations-chat 2022-02-26 23:50:44 Exposed motorlock, ew engines, and funky looking nose. No build is ever "perfect" and rarely are builds ever close to perfect.
creations-chat 2022-02-26 23:53:52 Your build is basic, knowing a trick in the game and creating a trash build just to argue about it is kinda stupid.
creations-chat 2022-02-27 00:21:39 looks choppy, intakes look bruh, and the cockpit and nose also look bruh

Developed trust issues
creations-chat 2022-03-25 06:57:33 haven't worked on it in a long time because i've been caught up with rust

creations-chat 2022-03-25 07:02:05 usually modded servers
also can i make it semi-custom
creations-chat 2022-03-25 07:04:16 im not into the big grind and i like fast paced gameplay so usually unlocked bp 10x servers, but when im gonna play a long time with friends ill play a lower modded server without crafting mods or loot+
im still new so i'm learning a lot in high modded servers
creations-chat 2022-03-25 07:06:51 noooo competition!!!!
creations-chat 2022-03-25 07:10:07 <@!749583096650661959> so you mind if i make it custom, but still identifiable as "merkava"
creations-chat 2022-03-25 07:36:04 making the front of the hull
creations-chat 2022-03-26 13:45:02 imagine typing in the wrong chat
creations-chat 2022-03-27 11:22:31 how it look?
creations-chat 2022-03-29 08:10:20 canopy material and frame looks sus, engines are too far apart and the light blue looks off, rudders also look sus
as well as this the rear fuselage part sloping down looks weird
nose slope isn't continuous either
creations-chat 2022-04-02 01:44:46 the rear fuselage angle looks a bit sus along with the rudder and elevators
creations-chat 2022-04-03 10:35:15 Square engine
Good engine = upvotes
creations-chat 2022-04-17 02:52:07 canopy is too fat
creations-chat 2022-04-17 02:55:28 i could play the game again but i think i forgot how to build
