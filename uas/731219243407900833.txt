help 2021-10-16 04:27:29 Honestly, the rockets disappearing is probably just a bug that originates from the OP rocket bug fix.
help 2021-10-16 04:28:02 Really the only thing you can do is report it to a developer.

help 2021-10-16 04:30:07 Personally, I have never experienced a bug like this.
help 2021-10-16 04:32:37 Brand?
help 2021-10-16 04:33:02 What is the company?
help 2021-10-16 04:33:20 The computer.
help 2021-10-16 04:33:48 So you bought a computer without even knowing the brand..?
help 2021-10-16 04:33:57 I use a dell...
help 2021-10-16 04:34:21 It should say on the back or front of the computer.
help 2021-10-16 04:35:49 Okay, so.
help 2021-10-16 04:36:08 Looked up the brand, seems reliable.
help 2021-10-16 04:36:22 So its probably just a bug
help 2021-10-16 04:36:39 And by the way, in game say "!fps"
