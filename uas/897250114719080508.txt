bug-reports 2022-05-09 05:05:45 I build a submarine. 
The sub is XId2 (no symbols, of course)
I put a 10cm flak cannon.
I test it.
It touches water
It ceased from existence
Apparently having more than 4 cylinders on my flak cannons screws it all so when 6 cylinder???
creations-chat 2022-05-09 05:08:05 Im building my first U-boat (IXd2 of course)
Very good outside so far, except for weapons.
