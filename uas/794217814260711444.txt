bot-central 2022-07-02 00:25:10 ?shelp
bot-central 2022-07-02 00:27:01 &suggest Add a feature in the smoke/snow pipes that allows them to either start instantly when a building is launched or requires a key to start after you launch a building 
(basically so you dont have to turn off smoke pipes as soon as you launch a building )
help 2022-07-02 04:02:45 what does the torque do on motors?
help 2022-07-02 04:19:15 alr thanks my dad told me what it was awhile ago but I didnt understand it at the time
help 2022-07-02 04:19:24 i mean i probably couldve just googled it
help 2022-07-02 08:55:23 anyone have any ideas on how to make this walk?
help 2022-07-02 08:55:30 like where would i put the motors and such
help 2022-07-02 08:55:45 i already have motors installed in the legs
help 2022-07-02 08:55:48 i just like
help 2022-07-02 08:55:53 i nee dit in the ankles and top legs
help 2022-07-02 08:57:15 i might need to remove the fake hydraulics because they block movement
help 2022-07-02 09:31:41 yeah
help 2022-07-02 09:31:45 but
help 2022-07-02 09:31:48 any tips for now?
help 2022-07-02 09:31:50 im too far in
help 2022-07-02 09:42:43 its too stable to where i cant make it move
help 2022-07-02 09:47:04 or maybe he doesnt have a tailblade?
help 2022-07-02 09:47:13 i mean it sounds like common knowledge but who knows
help 2022-07-02 09:47:19 maybe he doesnt know
help 2022-07-02 09:51:32 you havnet?
help 2022-07-02 09:53:29 havent
help 2022-07-02 09:53:31 typo
help 2023-05-19 21:31:51 does anyone know how fast pistons move
help 2023-05-20 03:22:14 which mechagodzilla is that
help 2023-05-20 03:22:28 i know its been like over a year but i was just browsing through old builds
creations-chat 2023-05-20 03:34:29 my mechagodzilla project
creations-chat 2023-05-20 05:53:44 cant wait to finish it
creations-chat 2023-05-20 15:47:22 mechagodzilla project
creations-chat 2023-05-27 04:00:34 progress on my mechagodzilla project

yall think this will make HOF when finished?
creations-chat 2023-05-27 04:51:41 i feel like when i finish i should just wait for pc2 to drop or wait for the server to become active again because i dont want this to become lost like a lot of other amazing creations
creations-chat 2023-05-27 05:15:40 real
creations-chat 2023-05-28 01:31:19 more progress on the mechagodzilla project
creations-chat 2023-05-28 02:06:48 1 player compared to the size of the build so far
creations-chat 2023-05-28 02:19:55 the only issue is that i made the current torso (its aobut 2/3 built) too tall so i dont know if its going to make it look too akward.
i cant go back though so ill have to work with what i have
creations-chat 2023-05-28 02:24:26 the back now has covers, the reason i take long is because i have to go through many different designs and adjust 1 pixel issues because theres so many motors

most of the time im really just experimenting and tuning the motors to make sure it fits right

after im done with the bottom area of the torso you will start to see changes to the build
creations-chat 2023-05-28 08:16:20 is this better?

i think its too chunky though, i tried to slim it down and it seems to be an accurate scale compared to the legs but it still seems too big
creations-chat 2023-05-28 08:28:46 i love that, is that the 2021 version or a different one? it kinda lookslike the ready plyer one version to me
creations-chat 2023-05-28 08:31:11 i think the top of the head is too round, it sohuld be more sharper like this
other than that it looks amazing

also if you want i can show you how to make a laser beam that i learned from one of the HOF builders
creations-chat 2023-05-28 23:23:52 does anyone know how to fix this? 
im trying to fold to the top of my mechagodzilla but no matter what settings i put on the motor it keeps going downwards, bcakwards or foward, max torque or not, it wont move upwards

nvm i partially have it figured out, when i fold i normally use motor 2s on servo and toggle, but i guess for this case i have to use standard motors for it to fold

if anyone does know why this phenomenon happens i would like to know
help 2023-05-29 05:34:31 what do ballast tanks do?
creations-chat 2023-05-30 13:27:38 the arms are taking place now
theres going to be so many controls so i will probably have a friend also hook up a keyboard to the pc so we can both control it like some pacific rim type thing
a majority of the keys on my full sized keyboard are already taken and i havent made a lot of other features
creations-chat 2023-05-30 13:35:17 the only blocky part is the back i think

i plan on redesigning the back parts once im done with everything else
creations-chat 2023-06-01 07:05:40 first part of the right arm complete
hopefully i can finish the whole arm tomorrow

creations-chat 2023-06-02 03:29:03 this random was trying to tell me how to build my mechagodzilla ðŸ’€ðŸ’€
creations-chat 2023-06-02 03:35:09 first arm of the mecha g complete
creations-chat 2023-06-02 03:41:35 Real
creations-chat 2023-06-02 03:44:19 I think just the lower needs to be wider
creations-chat 2023-06-02 03:47:44 Originally it was WAY too wide anyways
creations-chat 2023-06-03 06:42:40 second arm is done
creations-chat 2023-06-03 07:20:38 game crashed after it fell into the void

i literally have to use task manager to fix it
creations-chat 2023-06-04 22:32:43 do you guys think this upper chest area is good enough or should i change it

something seems off about it but i cant really tell what
creations-chat 2023-06-04 22:49:47 besides the gap in the middle
creations-chat 2023-06-04 22:51:49 you said that last time
creations-chat 2023-06-04 22:54:54 is it that far off?

i could make the lower waist wider ig
creations-chat 2023-06-04 23:02:37 yeah i think that did the trick
creations-chat 2023-06-05 01:31:51 which side looks better? left or right

better view

creations-chat 2023-06-05 03:15:39 how much would decent amount of pistons be
creations-chat 2023-06-05 03:21:52 my mecha g is 5k blocks and has like 6 or 8 pistons
creations-chat 2023-06-05 03:26:07 it perfectly works but it starts to slide backwards after i completely launch it

which is 80% probably from all the motorlocking and motors overall
help 2023-06-05 04:52:12 https://medal.tv/games/roblox/clips/1cFwHdDyumT9QM/d1337U3Z65V2?invite=cr-MSxPWjYsNjAzNjYwNDks anyone know how to fix my mg21 from sliding backwards/
help 2023-06-05 05:14:58 it wont stop sliding backwards but i dont know why
help 2023-06-05 06:35:07 fixed it turns out there were some max torque motors that shoouldnt have been ther
