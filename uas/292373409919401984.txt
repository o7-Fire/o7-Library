bug-reports 2019-02-23 02:03:57 I am currently trying to turn the "steering" thing OFF on my wheels but they won't turn off and they are messing with my vehicle by flailing all about when I drive.
bug-reports 2019-02-23 02:04:24 I tried resetting the game, the webpage, and my WIFI. And yet its still not turning off.
bug-reports 2019-02-25 21:18:47 My wheels are loose in the game and keep flailing when I am using them even when I set the steering option to "off". Setting steering to "off" makes it a little better, but they are still loose and still flail about.
help 2019-02-25 21:32:22 hey where can I report two people for spamming?
bug-reports 2019-03-04 20:26:13 The motors do not work when they are set to lock. When I move them, They glitch out and appear far away from where they are supposed to be.
