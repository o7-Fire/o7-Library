creations-chat 2021-07-07 15:36:02 A ship that Has flat deck and can carry any type of aircraft is a aircraft carrier.

Doesn't matter if it uses a ramp, catapult, or aircraft that land vertically, or use wires to land.

Anything with a flat deck and planes, or helicopters, is considered an aircraft carrier
creations-chat 2021-07-13 14:40:45 any feedback for my tank destroyer? it is my third tank build and I'm pretty proud of it

creations-chat 2021-11-20 10:49:44 yea other than that, i cant make the wings fold tho
creations-chat 2021-11-20 11:10:41 he should fix himself <:empty:794431705070174238>
creations-chat 2021-11-21 23:10:38 The intakes is 2 wide and 2 tall, I use 2 lock towers to connect the body and the intakes with the second lock tower being angled locked,I can dm you pictures of my intakes later im glad to help, the sides where motorlocked with half block and wingpanel(delta wings too) then the small 1 half bock extension on the bottom i also made a 1 and a half lock tower for it
creations-chat 2021-11-22 02:36:03 is there anyway i can hide the landing gears without removing some motor lock in the forward fuselage?
creations-chat 2021-11-22 02:38:18 props inside, for yaw
creations-chat 2021-11-22 02:51:02 i will give an honest feedback to your build, your biplane reminds me of ww1 bombers, so i suggest making it bigger, the whole fuselage has the correct shape, just make the top of it a little curvy,the back which goes inwards, then the bottom wings of the biplane should be angled upward
creations-chat 2021-11-22 02:56:49 yaw is weak with wing panel vert control surfaces, i rather use fake tails with props
creations-chat 2021-11-22 03:23:31 actually yea, thanks for that

creations-chat 2022-04-23 09:41:30 bro wants justice because of some low effort build joke

you do you i guess
creations-chat 2022-04-25 10:48:57 <@700426010067468340>  Grammar fix: only use "an" when the next word starts with a vowel letter (A,E,I,O,U), but when its a Consonant letter( B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, R, S, T, V, W, X, Y,Z) use "a"

😁😁😁

so it would be "a flying car"
creations-chat 2022-04-25 11:28:15 The average PCC member would reply with "whitename XD your opinion doesn't matter"

I'm not the average PCC member
creations-chat 2022-04-25 11:33:43 I downvoted bc no color 🤓 🤓 🤓 

But in all seriousness I can't  build a car and plane merged to 1 so I don't have the right to say its bad,   that's why I upvoted your interwar italian fighter, you could say that a bad looking build can be as good as a motorlocked good looking one, simply by looking at the deeper meaning on why it's built, if it looks bad who cares the creator gave all of their time and effort to make a bad looking build, thus making it a good build because the creator gave all their knowledge and effort, the same goes for motorlocked builds.

Cheers to the guy with the balls to submit his build to PCC, knowing that he would get downvoted
creations-chat 2022-04-25 11:37:28 Depends on where he/she lives, in the US they spell it "color", in the UK and commonwealth states they call it "colour" depends on the person really

I spell and type it as "color" since it's easier to type
