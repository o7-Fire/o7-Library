creations-chat 2021-06-27 18:42:58 how are the wings incorrect?
creations-chat 2021-06-27 18:46:54 k thx ill see how it looks
creations-chat 2021-06-27 19:44:05 k thx ill see what i can change
creations-chat 2021-07-10 19:35:45 that is the cinematic variant (meant to look good) i have an exploding variant that doesnt look as good on my yt
creations-chat 2021-08-30 17:02:12 really?, cause this is my model
creations-chat 2021-08-30 17:04:14 idk, that looks like a viper, but mines a cobra, so...
creations-chat 2021-08-30 20:46:17 i said "AH-1W Super Cobra" not AH-1F Cobra, like READ
creations-chat 2021-08-30 20:51:36 and tell me how i would know that "idiot who cant read simple english"?
creations-chat 2021-08-30 20:55:15 i mean ik how an AH-1 looks compared to an AH-1Z Viper or AH-1W Cobra
creations-chat 2021-08-30 20:57:21 i mean frankly, i dont know what you were trying to achieve by posting a picture TOTALLY unrelated to the helicopter i built.
creations-chat 2021-12-14 12:59:41 indeed <:FineTroll:626841259746656289>
creations-chat 2021-12-14 13:02:19 idk what you mean
creations-chat 2021-12-14 13:04:34 im not using a client on top of that i would not be able to revert back to default sky even if i do delete the custom skybox
creations-chat 2021-12-14 13:07:48 how? ig video
creations-chat 2021-12-14 13:24:41 nope actually wings are exactly correct, so  are the engines, also ive alr made an updated version which i plan to showcase today  Btw you can come in game to see it for yourself
creations-chat 2021-12-14 13:27:39 i said see it for yourself <:Mhm:551152556324159488>
creations-chat 2021-12-14 13:29:59 idk the feedback tends to be way out of range so i try not to post here, also ppl who have never even made the build think they can give feedback
creations-chat 2021-12-14 13:34:18 ill do one test post of a different build and see what ppl say
creations-chat 2021-12-14 13:36:23 lol glad you said it <:EYES:525319504721608705>

creations-chat 2021-12-14 14:22:35 my phone 400$ and somehow it more money than my laptop (laptop $389 btw)
creations-chat 2021-12-14 14:27:08 mine LG Stylo 5
creations-chat 2021-12-14 14:30:53 mine 8gigs so i get about 60 fps on 6 graphics
creations-chat 2021-12-14 14:34:20 good idea might change dots to white to make a rival squadron
creations-chat 2021-12-14 14:36:28 oof, lol heres mine (i beg pls dont talk about the core i3)
creations-chat 2021-12-14 14:38:30 ooo his pc is the "Savage Beast Quad X" ultra pog ðŸ˜ŽðŸ˜Ž lol  always wanted one
creations-chat 2021-12-14 15:07:32 and so?
creations-chat 2021-12-14 15:09:36 Nothing in plane crazy looks exactly like the real thing, all we can do is cope.
creations-chat 2021-12-14 15:12:21 k tell me whats off and what you would do if you built one (has to be only 3 blocks tall) mind you that it can actually fly, its not only for looks
creations-chat 2021-12-14 15:18:11 k
creations-chat 2021-12-14 15:26:36 ik but its annoying when some unskilled twit tries to correct you on ur build. Its like if growling sidewinder tried giving you pointers on ur jet
