bug-reports 2019-02-10 00:39:28 Hey, theres been a bug for about 2 days now where players will glitch and continuously jump while on a moving craft and be sent skyward, I think its a collision issue? lemme know whats going on (:
bug-reports 2019-02-10 00:58:55 uh
bug-reports 2019-02-10 00:59:21 common sense~ when you turn the wheel round its pointing the other way, so therefore you have to reverse its controls
bug-reports 2019-02-10 01:03:25 Whus that meant to mean?
bug-reports 2019-02-10 01:04:27 Fine jeez, it was a joke thing for another server XD
creations-chat 2019-02-10 12:53:05 Does anyone know how I can stop people glitching on my  Land cruiser thingy.

On the lift shuttle when people stand inside, the doors close and it begins to lift people start jumping not of their own will, and then when they reach the top, when the walkways lower they kinda break cuz of the movement
bug-reports 2019-02-10 12:56:40 Is anyone else having the trouble of other crafts trying to get on your craft, or just another player they continuously jump and glitch?
bug-reports 2019-02-10 13:00:06 No no, ive had that problem too. it affect sthe landing walkways.
bug-reports 2019-02-10 13:00:24 I jump outdespite touching nothing, and they automatically lower, meaning the lfit cant go up.

creations-chat 2019-08-11 18:06:55 Guys
creations-chat 2019-08-11 18:27:16 Ive created an APT. The APT (Aka Advanced Passenger Train) Was designed in the early 1970's, and realeased by british rail in 1976, however after just 1 week it was so plagued by technical problems it was withdrawn from service until 1979 where it was re launched, however, the severe lean made passengers nausious so it was quietly withdrawn 2 weeks after it went into service and were promptly scrapped, after millions in funding. The train actively tilts into corners, allowing it to go much faster than a regular train round corners.
creations-chat 2019-08-11 18:28:28 Due to lack of space on the plot i made it double ended, with no power car, just motors at the wheels. My design has a maximum speed of 249 using motors alone, However around corners its maximum speed is 140-160
creations-chat 2019-08-11 18:29:14 It has a dining car, and luxurious seating, with ambient lighting throughout the train.
creations-chat 2019-08-11 18:29:32 passegner POV
creations-chat 2019-08-11 18:29:56 At night, the warm lighting truly brings it together
creations-chat 2019-08-11 18:30:20 Heres it tilting into the corner.

It has a large central Unpowered wheel, and a rear powered smaller wheel (ill post in a picture below) It also has the 3rd wheel, see it inside the big main wheel? That rotates like a ferris wheel, connecting the poorer district to the richer district tiers (not complete). Im not asking for any ranks YET, just can you guys Dm me with some feedback? Thankyou.
