bot-central 2021-01-27 16:36:07 !rank
creations-chat 2021-01-27 17:27:55 redbanana7 the top of youre canopy on your j7 looks a bit too sharp
creations-chat 2021-01-27 17:30:35 bruh a what
creations-chat 2021-01-27 17:49:00 will the boat be detachable i dont get it
creations-chat 2021-01-27 17:54:59 hmm thats confusing... maybe a rod on the bottom that goes into the boat similar to a trailer on a truck or something or a hook
creations-chat 2021-01-28 06:50:45 any comments on the f-35b?
creations-chat 2021-01-28 06:53:59 i mainly focused on the hover part, its not that good in flying conventionally
i wish wedge 1x0.9s are a thing so it could look a bit more smooth* :/
creations-chat 2021-01-28 06:59:30 the f-16?
creations-chat 2021-01-28 07:02:55 4d shapes for what though? 1x0.9 wedges or something like it could be useful for mechanisms or things that are being housed by wedges,
but i have to use 1x0.9 blocks making the build look blocky as eunsoo said
creations-chat 2021-01-28 07:10:16 i think its height width length and depth
creations-chat 2021-01-28 07:12:36 no, depth is how far out/in something is, take a look at this, from 2D>3D>4D
creations-chat 2021-01-28 07:15:34 not sure, im not a mathematical genius :/
creations-chat 2021-01-28 07:19:28 so any thoughts on the f-16? im guessing its too plain or wings too thin
creations-chat 2021-01-28 07:25:13 tried to replicate this, it isnt a perfect cylinder shape nose
creations-chat 2021-01-28 07:30:18 oooh, i see, my f16 is the second jet i ever made and i made everything significantly better than the first version but the vert. stabilizer is the only one i forgot to do :/
should/can i post the picture of it after fixing it here, or in the help channel?
help 2021-01-28 07:36:09 eunsoo is this better?
help 2021-01-28 07:37:28 it was a while ago since i made this but i believe the vertical stabilizer was curved-ish because it was 3 blocks tall, not 4 so i had to use delta wing 1x2 then 1x1
creations-chat 2021-01-28 07:38:15 i posted the new version in <#478584971670454284>
help 2021-01-28 08:16:43 huh
help 2021-01-28 08:19:04 2nd method cause idk
creations-chat 2021-01-28 09:15:55 yeah, getting ideas for builds is hard for me
help 2021-01-28 15:47:12 how to make this more smooth and not blocky?
help 2021-01-28 15:47:51 the block on the other side of the motor is a 0.9
help 2021-01-28 16:25:48 im not that good at motorlocking but ill try, thanks for the suggestion
creations-chat 2021-01-29 07:30:18 other than the green colors that you put in there for some reason, its good
creations-chat 2021-01-29 07:32:36 oooh i see, just didnt look like any conventional bus
thats a lot of motorlocking though oh my god lol
help 2021-01-29 08:08:56 why do my motor 2s have seizures after going around 600+ speed

creations-chat 2021-01-29 10:13:37 any thoughts on my f-35b?
creations-chat 2021-01-29 10:16:14 maybe something to do w your device idk
creations-chat 2021-01-29 10:26:28 it would look way more like it if you'd straighten the vertical stabilizers, and made it 2 engines, but its up to you if you want
creations-chat 2021-01-29 15:20:39 nah, 101

creations-chat 2021-01-29 16:57:30 ?
help 2021-01-29 17:11:29 what cargo planes' (military preferably) front looks most like this? i wanna try to build a cargoplane but i dont know which one so im just building a custom one rn
help 2021-01-29 17:11:37 any thoughts too
help 2021-01-29 19:32:33 tryna make a c17 globemaster now
help 2021-01-29 19:32:37 anyone know how to improve this?
creations-chat 2021-01-31 03:56:32 wings look too skinny by height and width, try using blocks as wings and motorlocking wingpanels onto them, like nannoc said the plane is too short by length and the curve towards the tail at the bottom thing is too steep, try not using pyramids at the end of planes with stubby noses, try keeping it flat or  try 2 half wedges' underside back to back (as if the wedge part was the top) or something like it, nose looks too short too i think
creations-chat 2021-01-31 04:03:12 the wings are tilted though, they used to be straight-winged in early prototypes but when they finished the final prototype (yb-52 i think) it was a swept wing plane
creations-chat 2021-01-31 04:07:01 which tilted exactly? swept wing/straight wing or up and down
creations-chat 2021-01-31 04:10:11 bruh

and for foreverpro_altt maybe add some dj equipment to make it look less bland, maybe fake speakers or those boxes that nobody knows whats in them, idk search some  stuff up
creations-chat 2021-01-31 04:15:24 of course they are, with such a heavy plane it has to be tilted downwards so the lift of the wings will just straighten it out anyway, cause if its straight and like, solid then it may break easier, i thought tongdee meant tilted as in swept wing
creations-chat 2021-01-31 04:20:44 "i thought tongdee meant tilted as in swept wing" :/
also again, of course they are because there needs to space for the engines since the wings are tilted down, it may hit the ground, or dust may get sand/dirt into its engine since its so low
creations-chat 2021-01-31 04:25:12 whats your point in this exactly
all 3 of your messages
creations-chat 2021-01-31 05:03:22 thoughts on my cargoplane?
creations-chat 2021-01-31 05:06:06 alright ill try, but not too sure about the engine, when i made it 3x3 looked small and just didnt fit on my plane
creations-chat 2021-01-31 05:09:50 alright,
and by too small take a look at the engines on a c17 for example, i know its all perspective, but it was still referrence for how big the engines should be
wrong send
creations-chat 2021-01-31 05:14:23 
creations-chat 2021-01-31 05:18:03 spot the emoji

help 2021-01-31 12:20:55 of course i know how to motorlock, my wings are made of blocks how would i fly if i didnt know how to lock wing panels into them :/
help 2021-01-31 12:25:14 coleopter?
help 2021-01-31 12:25:56 ok thats probably pretty much the problem
help 2021-01-31 12:26:23 motor 2s are buggy right now
help 2021-01-31 12:26:41 you just gotta wait til they fix it i guess
help 2021-01-31 12:32:42 lack of wing panels? idk, the coleopter is pretty weird
help 2021-01-31 13:04:24 are there any wingpanels locked in them?
creations-chat 2021-01-31 14:06:03 you probably should have made the harrier design first, not the vtol part, because if you change the design the balance may change or no space for the mechanism

use sketchfab if you want to use 3d models
bug-reports 2021-02-02 03:52:15 server or in game

help 2021-06-21 17:25:35 ask them why they downvoted it
help 2021-06-21 17:26:02 main reason people (or maybe just me) post their creations is to get feedback and stuff
creations-chat 2021-06-21 17:26:19 anyone?
creations-chat 2021-06-21 17:30:14 1. learn how to screenshot (windows key + prt screen, or win + shift + s for snip)
2. too mmuch skis (in my opinion)
3. propellers at the front looks kinda ugly

creations-chat 2021-06-22 10:56:17 left or right? for bf109
:/
creations-chat 2021-06-22 10:59:25 can you send pic of another angle
engine is too low
creations-chat 2021-06-22 11:23:49 i know its not the body but windshield goes too far back
creations-chat 2021-06-22 11:33:29 pog
bug-reports 2021-06-22 16:02:48 plane turns side to side after i bank/roll for some reason (first few secs in the air i wasnt even controlling the plane)
bug-reports 2021-06-22 16:04:07 tried it w control surfaces and motor ailerons
bug-reports 2021-06-22 16:05:59 unbinded the aileron keys, still does it so it isnt the aileron at fault
bug-reports 2021-06-22 16:09:34 have you considered the possibility i motorlocked wingpanels inside
bug-reports 2021-06-22 16:09:36 vertically
bug-reports 2021-06-22 16:09:56 also why would it shake that violently
bug-reports 2021-06-22 16:10:05 when all i did was turn slightly
bug-reports 2021-06-22 16:10:50 ??
bug-reports 2021-06-22 16:11:18 did you even watch the second video
bug-reports 2021-06-22 16:11:38 i wasnt even controlling the plane at that time
bug-reports 2021-06-22 16:11:41 only the elevator
bug-reports 2021-06-22 16:11:46 yet it still did it
bug-reports 2021-06-22 16:12:12 also it happens on my other plane too, so the fact the rudder is tiny (externally) doesnt mean thats the problem
bug-reports 2021-06-22 16:12:27 so?
bug-reports 2021-06-22 16:12:53 that doesnt explain the fact it still goes side to side when i wasnt even controlling the plane
bug-reports 2021-06-22 16:13:58 show me a picture of your planes' rudders
bug-reports 2021-06-22 16:14:03 if this is considered small
bug-reports 2021-06-22 16:14:21 also back when i first made this there wasnt any problems??
bug-reports 2021-06-22 16:14:27 aka 6 months ago
bug-reports 2021-06-22 16:14:46 if it were present since then, then why would i just keep it like that?
bug-reports 2021-06-22 16:15:36 now those are peas lol
bug-reports 2021-06-22 16:16:12 yeah and compared to the severity of the shaking mines pretty ok-sized
bug-reports 2021-06-22 16:16:29 so my vertical stabilizers and ailerons arent to blame
bug-reports 2021-06-22 16:17:33 this is the size of the vertical stabilizer on my best fighter (motorlocked wingpanels are only a bit more than the ones on the f22)
bug-reports 2021-06-22 16:17:39 its the f22
bug-reports 2021-06-22 16:17:52 if you watched the video you could see me loading a file called "F-22 Raptor"
bug-reports 2021-06-22 16:17:57 :/
bug-reports 2021-06-22 16:19:02 ok and????
bug-reports 2021-06-22 16:19:14 so just ignore the fact that i motorlocked wingpanels inside
bug-reports 2021-06-22 16:19:36 for what?
bug-reports 2021-06-22 16:19:57 thats the fucking point of the MOTORLOCKED WINGPANELS
bug-reports 2021-06-22 16:21:34 so im assuming youve never seen this ever?
bug-reports 2021-06-22 16:21:54 yeah exactly
bug-reports 2021-06-22 16:21:57 so you dont know what it does
bug-reports 2021-06-22 16:22:06 so dont go around assuming
bug-reports 2021-06-22 16:22:26 can anyone else help me in this?
bug-reports 2021-06-22 16:24:08 coming from a person who has never motorlocked wingpanels to stabilize your plane in high speeds <:4Weird:709084058721714324>
bug-reports 2021-06-22 16:24:27 doesnt mean others also dont
bug-reports 2021-06-22 16:25:41 if anyone else wants to help (please)
bug-reports 2021-06-22 16:26:23 all things that provide thrust are in the center
bug-reports 2021-06-22 16:26:35 so its not those making it go side to side
bug-reports 2021-06-22 16:27:19 also tried it w/o the landing gears (that maybe turn while retracted) still made it go side to side
bug-reports 2021-06-22 16:27:20 watch the vid
bug-reports 2021-06-22 16:27:44 when i try to roll, it turns side to side after
bug-reports 2021-06-22 16:27:49 when i try to roll slightly*
bug-reports 2021-06-22 16:27:55 hoverdrive
bug-reports 2021-06-22 16:28:24 should i try to replace the hoverdrive engines w rocket engines?
bug-reports 2021-06-22 16:28:33 the vid shows it better
bug-reports 2021-06-22 16:28:48 i replied to it
bug-reports 2021-06-22 16:28:53 . (the reply of that reply)
bug-reports 2021-06-22 16:29:27 it also happens with another plane, just only slightly
bug-reports 2021-06-22 16:29:47 first vid shows it w control surfaces, and motor ailerons
bug-reports 2021-06-22 16:30:04 second shows it with unbinded ailerons, so when i press a and d it still does it
bug-reports 2021-06-22 16:30:40 
bug-reports 2021-06-22 16:31:28 its perfectly balanced
bug-reports 2021-06-22 16:31:42 when i reach max speed for a millisecond (cause of the bug) it doesnt tip down/up
bug-reports 2021-06-22 16:32:42 ok thanks ill expand it now
bug-reports 2021-06-22 16:36:35 already did
bug-reports 2021-06-22 16:36:42 already put the max amount possible
bug-reports 2021-06-22 16:36:48 anything else
bug-reports 2021-06-22 16:39:19 ...
bug-reports 2021-06-22 16:39:26 did you watch the video yet
bug-reports 2021-06-22 16:39:39 when i roll left, it goes right
bug-reports 2021-06-22 16:39:53 thats the opposite of physics
bug-reports 2021-06-22 16:40:01 ??
bug-reports 2021-06-22 16:40:49 ok so the plane going vertical without me controlling it is physics?
bug-reports 2021-06-22 16:41:30 cant wait for the rewrite
bug-reports 2021-06-22 16:42:18 by ?
bug-reports 2021-06-22 16:42:59 .
bug-reports 2021-06-22 16:43:15 .
bug-reports 2021-06-22 16:45:31 ty for the feedback im glad i posted this so that i could get helpful comments like this
bug-reports 2021-06-22 16:48:57 alright, so plane swinging side to side severely with only the slightest turn, it doing a vertical climb without me controlling it are not bugs, and theres nothing weird at all when my plane goes crazy after leaving it untouched for a few months
bug-reports 2021-06-22 16:48:58 got it
bug-reports 2021-06-22 16:49:47 this is probably the most useful answer ive gotten honestly
bug-reports 2021-06-22 16:50:53 so you havent watched the video
bug-reports 2021-06-22 16:50:54 alright
bug-reports 2021-06-22 16:51:54 are you telling me you call that a vertical climb
bug-reports 2021-06-22 16:51:59 go to 0:24 i nthe video
bug-reports 2021-06-22 16:52:56 or a bit earlier
bug-reports 2021-06-22 16:53:27 is that when i hit the train tracks?
bug-reports 2021-06-22 16:54:09 yes or no?
bug-reports 2021-06-22 16:54:37 ???? is it that hard to answer a yes or no question??
bug-reports 2021-06-22 16:55:12 you called this a vertical climb lol
bug-reports 2021-06-22 16:55:44 this was when i was taking off mf
bug-reports 2021-06-22 16:57:57 oh i thought i was at base, ok yeah my bad
bug-reports 2021-06-22 16:58:13 still, whats wrong with trying to keep the plane in the air
bug-reports 2021-06-22 16:58:36 so i could show the "bug"?
bug-reports 2021-06-22 16:59:43 ill do one where i wont control it at all
bug-reports 2021-06-22 17:01:47 
bug-reports 2021-06-22 17:02:15 dont mind the keyboard mashing
bug-reports 2021-06-22 17:03:06 also will we just ignore the part saying it was working a few months ago
bug-reports 2021-06-22 17:03:15 when it was newly finished :/
bug-reports 2021-06-22 17:11:14 this convo already ended but pretty sure i wouldnt be able to take ss like these with the swinging
bug-reports 2021-06-22 17:18:00 so im pretty confident its something w roblox
bug-reports 2021-06-22 17:19:01 or an update broke my plane

creations-chat 2021-10-02 08:15:11 feedback on maus pls, third time making a tank ever so i wanna improve
creations-chat 2021-10-02 09:03:23 feedback, and this are complete opposite things

alright ty
creations-chat 2022-03-27 09:33:36 yes its a repost
creations-chat 2022-03-27 21:49:27 yeah it was and hopefully me putting 4 blades wasn't misleading or anything, i was too focused on making the rest of the plane so i didn't bother with making the props tri-bladed
creations-chat 2022-03-28 09:10:09 feedback pls so i dont get downvotes from strangers
creations-chat 2022-03-28 09:15:28 yeah i think i see that, the top has a gentle curve to it, but i cant fix that unless i move all of the motorlock (the motorlock chain thing is in there at the top
ill try making that little nudge at the nose (the cooling i think)
creations-chat 2022-03-28 09:20:08 i was following one of those images where it shows the hex of the colors used, they couldve been innacurate so yeah ill try changing the rgb til it sort-of looks right

ty for all the feedback guys, ill try fixing the colors, nose, etc
might make the wings thicker if i have time
creations-chat 2022-03-28 09:29:24 i think i made it better (left is the new one)

yes i cant add an ejector seat it is very cramped
creations-chat 2022-03-28 13:06:55 very true
creations-chat 2022-03-28 13:20:21 said this to another guy too but i cant do anything about the spine, but ill do something about the nose
fixing the colors rn, and ill try making the wings thicker
i know its 3 bladed, i was just focused on other parts, so i just made it 4
creations-chat 2022-03-28 14:03:37 "improved" do 335 nose so far
creations-chat 2022-03-28 14:10:12 <@!783822669182795806> dont know if you want feedback on it, but add that slit in the middle of the canopy
creations-chat 2022-03-29 10:55:49 are the motors locked

then i think thats why, it happens to me too
they are kinda buggy and move slightly for some reason, theres no way to fix it i dont think
help 2022-08-02 23:26:52 going crazy over this, im using camera angle lock for this and they arent symmetrical, even though the blocks theyre pointed to are the exact same distance
help 2022-08-02 23:27:42 pretty sure they have the same angle but one of them is just barely lower
help 2022-08-02 23:31:16 the left wing is inwards while the right wing is outwards
help 2022-08-02 23:33:18 is this just some small bug
help 2022-08-03 10:53:06 thanks
help 2022-08-03 10:54:12 i managed to fix it because of your helpfulness 👍
creations-chat 2022-08-03 13:56:35 as in it doesnt let you copy n paste it into the text thing?
creations-chat 2022-08-03 14:10:40 make it look a little damaged-ish by the environment
creations-chat 2022-08-03 14:24:52 no it isnt
maybe its just the picture but the blue is too bright/vibrant
creations-chat 2022-08-03 14:28:25 i think hes only using blue in his color, he needs to add a little green or red
not sure if this shows it
creations-chat 2022-08-03 18:16:50 he said visible for a reason 💀
creations-chat 2022-08-03 18:27:09 absolute fire
creations-chat 2022-08-03 18:29:27 all i can say is it is indeed big..
creations-chat 2022-08-03 18:40:24 RIGGED
creations-chat 2022-08-03 18:43:15 i know, i have a fleet of delta airliners so i just said fuck it and i made it delta

creations-chat 2022-08-03 22:57:59 i dont mind, this is entertaining
creations-chat 2022-08-03 23:03:51 if you refresh it goes away i think
creations-chat 2022-08-03 23:06:11 can someone tell me what unde is cause im pretty sure its not the urban dictionary meaning
creations-chat 2022-08-03 23:08:57 i dont recommend searching it up
creations-chat 2022-08-03 23:12:41 wheres my upvotes
creations-chat 2022-08-03 23:16:51 i dont get it
creations-chat 2022-08-03 23:19:34 i motorlocked this using trails (real)
<@773287769488752653> its just rocket and jet engines motorlocked together with a circle emoji at the front
creations-chat 2022-08-03 23:23:23 wrong, i actually used text blocks and added a square emoji to each and used it to make a perfect block, and i actually used pc2's unreleased blocks to make a perfect cylindrical shape, with the help of motorlocked trails to smooth it out
creations-chat 2022-08-03 23:27:52 its a joke
creations-chat 2022-08-03 23:36:11 ah. it appears youve seen through my scheme. but youre still **wrong**
i hacked into the mainframe of the pentagon to access the database to each and every branch of the government, using the data hackers and the fbi have collected, i have enough information to make an educated guess on roblox headquarters' password. i was the reason behind the oof being removed. while everyone was taking notice of the incredibly dogshit new death sound, i had secretly been working on a way to enhance the resolution and pixels of my monitor and enhanced the sharpness and smoothness of my roblox application in order to make the truly perfect circle. but it wasn't enough, so i indeed hack into rickje's account, in order for his code to simply understand all of the megapixels being sent, and finding a way to present it. i was successful, and left with the perfect circle.
creations-chat 2022-08-03 23:39:28 i spent way too long on that, i need to sleep its 4am

<@722317663044501544> rick said "current planned release date", hinting that it might change but idk
creations-chat 2022-08-04 10:24:22 15 why
creations-chat 2022-08-04 10:33:50 low effort, couldve added a couple more pixels of detail, the background is not historically accurate, as there is a pixel of off-color sky that doesnt match the color of the atmosphere back then 🤓
creations-chat 2022-08-04 10:36:10 yesterday he said that he was 13, so you didnt have to
