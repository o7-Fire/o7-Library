creations-chat 2021-12-28 23:12:23 <@!294980570885390346> who is martin and why is he locked in a heed?
creations-chat 2021-12-29 13:53:12 Might just be me, but the intakes look a little long. Maybe shorten it by a half block or block?
creations-chat 2021-12-29 13:57:24 Hm... Maybe it's because there's no fuel tanks on the normal f15

which makes it look a little slim even though the length is fine

but pro model nonetheless
creations-chat 2021-12-29 13:59:50 You could try pontoons, that might work for the conformals

creations-chat 2021-12-30 15:05:23 <@!678986403153182772> i’d color it a little more if i were you. It looks kinda off just 1 flat color
creations-chat 2021-12-30 15:07:29 :v
creations-chat 2021-12-30 15:09:34 Yes but just 1 color for ever part looks really bad. The real thing would have used different materials for certain parts making them vary slightly in color

Bare minimum you could do is make the wheels a little darker. Maybe 55,55,55
