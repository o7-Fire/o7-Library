help 2021-04-20 02:17:29 I need some help making an airship work without helium...if you can help please dm me and we can vc or smth.
creations-chat 2021-04-20 02:20:20 f-f-f-faaaaake

*no hacks, just video editing software*?

then how does it work? because it seems video edited to me, due to the fact that EVERY time you use it, the target circle appears on your screen for the same exact amount of time (unless its a continual video loop put into one file)
creations-chat 2021-04-20 02:23:32 ill go look


OOOOh thats very true.

hmmm still seems weird on HOW it works. confuzzling
help 2021-04-20 02:40:04 can someone help me make a blimp work without helium? (Sorry to be annoying)
help 2021-04-20 02:41:23 shouldnt not use helium?
help 2021-04-20 02:41:41 i have to do it without helium, its pat of the requirements <@!513499940924817408>
creations-chat 2021-04-20 20:02:21 can someone help me make my blimp fly? i can vc (and stream)
help 2021-04-20 20:04:09 can someone help me make my blimp fly? i can vc (and stream)
help 2021-04-20 20:10:26 yea...migs dont have guns. they are too fast, so they use rockets only. the plane would be faster than the guns, as their top speed is Mach 2.15. THis can be proven due to an unhappy incident in which a plane shot itself down. The plane in this case had a top speed of approximately 1.8 Machs. This plane was the Grumman F-11F-1, and the pilot wasn't even going top speed. This plane being much slower than the Mig which goes Mach 2.15, means that the Mig would shoot itself down.
creations-chat 2021-04-20 20:10:57 imagine being the first pilot to have shot himself down while testing a plane :/ scary thought
help 2021-04-20 20:43:54 Incorrect. The bullet momentum will NOT last forever. Eventually the BULLET will slow in speed and the PLANE will not. Thereby running into its own shots.
help 2021-04-22 19:53:23 as i continually pointed out in dms, you are incorrect. THe bullet LOSES momentum quickly.
help 2021-04-22 22:07:18 EXACTLY! thank you

creations-chat 2021-05-12 02:26:41 as ive said previously. This community is NOT good at choosing what is good and what isnt. People who actually rate based off merit get yelled at, and all the people who do hard work for little show get ignored. But, its important to note that politeness and respect should be upheld.
creations-chat 2021-05-12 02:29:51 ^^^exactly. People need to learn respect, and today's society seems to think no one needs respect. Merit is important, but so is respect.
