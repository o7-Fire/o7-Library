help 2021-09-01 04:02:39 I recommend you look for some real life references on the Internet
bug-reports 2021-09-01 17:12:45 I was sailing with my ship but then this guy appeared and started glitching it and then used the parachute. I blacklisted him to try avoid it but the parachute is still solid to the ship. This should be fixed so the blacklist go-through feature can also be applied to it.
creations-chat 2021-09-06 15:41:56 Awh thanks. :P
Thank my friend too, he helped alot. (OnoctM)
creations-chat 2021-09-06 15:46:15 I also helped with the ideas for the foldings and stuff, it's very tricky
creations-chat 2021-09-06 15:54:39 The problem is that Carpathia doesn't have interior, and there is a bug in the game that doesn't allow buildings to teleport when they are above 10k blocks
creations-chat 2021-09-06 16:22:47 Only the funnel

help 2021-10-20 05:33:11 I am making a huge bulk carrier and I still need to make the aft. castle, but the hull from where it will come with motor lock doesn't have space. What do I do?
help 2021-10-20 05:43:26 The main problem here is that the bow and the stern gets thinner than the center part, and I want to build the superstructure just in that place
help 2021-10-20 05:43:52 The other stuff on the deck I can handle because they can get bend down inside.
help 2021-10-20 05:48:23 
bug-reports 2021-10-23 03:46:29 I want to report a bug that may be well-known here, but I'm doing this again in hope for it to be fixed soon:

There is an annoying bug with the parachute collision that cannot be disabled with the blacklist feature and it use to cause buildings glitching and flying into the air. It means that people can use this to destroy other buildings and no one can actually do something to stop this.

I got no photos of a building glitching because the events happens very fast, but I have this photo of the parachute collision issue that I have posted before in here.
help 2021-11-24 04:09:39 So I'm making this "small" heavy bulk carrier ship... and I'm having some problems about the usage of space. The after deck tower (the white thing on the middle) comes out from inside the hull by motor lock, but it is from another section of folding. How do I bring it to the other part?
help 2021-11-24 04:10:41 The ship has 4 foldings in total,and the tower has to go to the last one (the very back of the ship)
help 2021-11-24 04:35:21 I tried to do it using that motor lock on the top but it just seems to make it worse
help 2021-11-24 04:36:07 What
help 2021-11-24 04:38:35 Yes but what does it have with what he said?
help 2021-11-24 04:39:08 I mean, you can move the "ball" by putting wings on other places I guess
help 2021-12-12 18:39:15 Is there some place where I can report people?
help 2022-01-09 18:43:42 I have an important question about the Plane Crazy store: Will the items that I bought in Plane Crazy 1 be moved to Plane Crazy 2?
help 2022-01-09 18:44:37 Is there a standard way to ask this to a developer?
help 2022-01-19 16:53:48 What happened with the game?
help 2022-01-19 16:54:11 I have tried to join it 3 times, and none of them worked. I also tried to join other games but this time it worked.
help 2022-01-19 17:11:00 It is because I tried to join other games after this and it worked
help 2022-01-19 17:11:09 but when I tried to join Plane Crazy again it didn't
help 2022-01-19 17:11:32 meh
help 2022-01-19 17:12:03 A friend of mine also suffered this same problem at the same time with me

help 2022-04-08 06:24:08 I wanted to suggest a feature for people being able to rotate blocks in 360° degrees, or some more than the multiples of 90°
help 2022-04-08 06:25:25 I'm not sure if you can, but if you can and wanna go there suggest this, I would thank
help 2022-04-08 06:25:32 or someone else that can. It's a nice idea to make smooth buildings easier.
help 2022-04-08 06:31:19 Sadly it's not possible to configure a control surface to be toggled down
help 2022-04-08 06:31:48 These people use rotated wings instead, with some midly complicated motor lock system

creations-chat 2022-08-02 17:22:52 I spent a lot of work into optimization, mainly removing useless blocks, and avoiding physics collisions

creations-chat 2022-08-02 17:56:37 I optimized the build to avoid lag and wanted to make it go as fast as it would go in real life (Something like 40Km/h)
creations-chat 2022-08-02 17:58:38 Do the missles work? (Not torpedoes)
creations-chat 2022-08-02 18:05:43 I can't see a torpedo there but ok-

Other than that, I can say that it is a pretty _t h i c k_ subarime, but add its masts and stuff on top to look more "navy"

bug-reports 2022-10-16 22:29:44 Blocks/builds/structures stay frozen in place after getting exploded/shot, while in reality the build for the other player is actually moving (These rockets were standing still in mid air when I took the screenshot, but they were actually moving with an annoying shredder around my base).

[SELECTION TOOL]
[Gameplay]

The idea is about a selection tool what would allow the player to have selected multiple blocks at once, which would make them able to use other tools like the Move tool in a more precise way, like how this tool does in the game Build a Boat for Treasure: (Image 1)

It would be helpful in situations when someone needs to move a large chunk for their construction, be it due to an error or design. Example is this truck which has a even center, something I didn't desire, but could be easily fixed with this tool: (Image 2)

The tool can be a feature in the upcoming Plane Crazy 2.
bug-reports 2022-11-02 21:58:44 Suspensions are SUPER glitchy. They almost always end inside my A320 at random times when I'm flying. Image 1 is the bug happening. Image 2 is how the suspension is originally. Image 3 is the debug screen while it's glitching. Image 4 is the save slot of the affected creation, and my username is SrBeats.

help 2023-02-26 16:59:38 I... never saw the effect
bug-reports 2023-03-10 20:42:54 No way to prove this with images right now, but there is a bug about the particles ceasing to work after you turn them off. I went to turn the particles to "None" as an attempt to avoid lag, and when the worst has passed, I went to turn them back on, but they just weren't working anymore.

bug-reports 2023-05-06 22:26:47 And I was about to report this same bug now
bug-reports 2023-05-06 23:02:57 I made some observations:

This bug only happens when you use the jetpack for the second time, and it slowly makes you ascend when it is actually being active
bug-reports 2023-05-06 23:25:06 I don't
bug-reports 2023-05-15 21:38:05 This is a very toxic behavior, ngl
bug-reports 2023-05-15 21:41:07 So, I was casually flying around my creation with some friends, and _this_ happened. I asked them if this has happened with them before, and they agreed
bug-reports 2023-05-15 21:41:39 Not sure when this started to happen, though... But it usually happens when you are with a jetpack for a certain amount of time, say about 10 minutes of flying around or with the jetpack not being used.
bug-reports 2023-05-15 21:52:56 Not about you, tho
bug-reports 2023-05-15 21:53:11 Just that one guy above that I'm not gonna mention directly
bug-reports 2023-05-15 22:01:26 _Shhh...._ 🤫
bug-reports 2023-05-15 22:01:56 Anyway, there is my bug. If someone knows that this is a Roblox side bug instead, let me know.
