bug-reports 2020-01-10 02:02:25 I’m in clicking “Jetpack” and it is not activating
bug-reports 2020-01-10 12:29:02 <@!321489477367496704> About the jetpack problem, I bought the gamepass and it was working fine. Then when I entered a server it turned red again, so I clicked it. The button turned green but wouldn’t activate, neither would the set key for it.
bug-reports 2020-01-10 12:30:55 I’m unsure about the device thing, as I have no other device that allows plane crazy.
bug-reports 2020-01-10 12:46:58 I don’t skip the loading, is there any way to avoid it or no?
bug-reports 2020-01-10 13:06:47 Alright, thanks
