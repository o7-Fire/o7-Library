creations-chat 2020-10-08 00:49:50 <@710208141144489995> nice tank. Is it a BT-2?
creations-chat 2020-10-08 00:50:13 Cool
creations-chat 2020-10-08 00:52:24 Cool
creations-chat 2020-10-08 00:53:00 Cool
creations-chat 2020-10-08 00:53:47 How do you make good quality guided missiles that are really small?
creations-chat 2020-10-08 00:54:49 I mean tiny. Small enough to fit inside a 3 wide, 3 tall, and 6 long missile bay
creations-chat 2020-10-08 00:55:23 How big was the missile
creations-chat 2020-10-08 00:55:58 Ok
creations-chat 2020-10-08 00:56:40 I need something that can fit in a 3 wide, 3 tall, and 6 long missile bay, and can be mouse guided
creations-chat 2020-10-08 00:58:21 I don't really want motorlocking, I have a potato pc that lags on minimum settings.
creations-chat 2020-10-08 00:59:40 I actually have a design that fits the criteria, but it doesn't work too well for me
creations-chat 2020-10-08 01:00:52 Does anyone think they can help me? I'm probably gonna be on in about 2 1/2 hours
creations-chat 2020-10-08 01:02:07 Nice
