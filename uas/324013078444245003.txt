bug-reports 2018-12-30 23:35:12 Mesh hitboxes
bug-reports 2018-12-30 23:36:12 For example, the reason corner wedge blocks have the same hitboxes as block is because they are meshes
bug-reports 2018-12-30 23:36:38 The only way to fix it is by building it with bricks inside of studio
bug-reports 2018-12-30 23:37:29 Which will cause lots of lag since one corner wedge block is gonna be more than 5 bricks
bug-reports 2018-12-30 23:37:51 And people will probably abuse them and lag everything.
