help 2021-08-14 15:22:37 motorlocking is very useful for detail or for a compact build pvp or not
the bigger the creation the easier to kill.. unless it’s manuverability is high right?
help 2021-08-14 15:25:12 if its a plane or helicopter, its wings and/or rotors will for sure die
help 2021-08-14 15:25:55 yea motorlock all guns available and it’s very quick lol
