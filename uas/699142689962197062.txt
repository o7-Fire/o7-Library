Hello thanks for reading! This is version 3.10 of my Buggy.

The leverage ratio is superior to that of more complex designs.
It has very superior anti-squat to compliment the leverage ratio.
It's linear in the first third of the travel but in the mid stroke it starts getting harder to compress and at the end its very progressive.
The anti-squat on the front is improved, only a fourth of the travel gets used during hard braking.
The suspension is more glued to the ground at high speeds than more complex suspension designs.
creations-chat 2020-05-02 12:59:33 It's very hard to flip as the center of mass is lowered, with the ballast blocks below.
