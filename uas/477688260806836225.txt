plane-crazy 2020-07-03 20:06:07 Well I just reinstalled and still not working
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 20:04:06 Like when I launch from the browser it is broken
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 20:03:50 LifeBro2 the launcher for the browser version does not work
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 20:00:33 Bruh roblox won't run
plane-crazy 2020-06-26 16:37:18 Which also prevents them from getting screwed up
plane-crazy 2020-06-26 16:36:50 So they aren't influenced by external factors
plane-crazy 2020-06-26 16:36:28 How do I make it so motors only turn when I press a key
plane-crazy 2020-06-26 16:35:44 I need help
