Its a start....
creations-chat 2018-12-02 02:25:20 Eh
creations-chat 2018-12-02 02:25:27 Its so damn hard
creations-chat 2018-12-02 02:25:30 XD
creations-chat 2018-12-02 02:26:00 Thank ya
creations-chat 2018-12-02 02:34:31 Use more wedges
creations-chat 2018-12-02 02:34:34 Too blocky
creations-chat 2018-12-02 02:34:57 But the lighting is good though
creations-chat 2018-12-02 05:08:00 Yaw matters too
creations-chat 2018-12-02 05:08:47 Placing thrusters in for yaw control should be not too far but not too close either
creations-chat 2018-12-02 05:09:01 Ah
creations-chat 2018-12-02 05:09:13 You mean for control surfaces
creations-chat 2018-12-02 05:09:16 nvm XD
creations-chat 2018-12-02 22:06:16 So like, why does Roblox do that?
creations-chat 2018-12-02 22:06:25 Whenever you go too fast?
creations-chat 2018-12-03 01:20:48 WIP Airship
creations-chat 2018-12-03 09:40:34 The Havdrissul

Has rockets facing downward for bombing
creations-chat 2018-12-03 09:40:53 Its an airship
creations-chat 2018-12-03 09:41:30 
creations-chat 2018-12-03 09:42:38 Can I have Modeller and Expert Engineer rank?
creations-chat 2018-12-07 07:49:10 I don't care what anyone says, I keep this forever
bug-reports 2018-12-09 02:23:50 -- Fix Magnets so that when you're using multiple magnets on a creation for movement, the one that you let go doesn't deactivate the one you're still holding down.

For instance, I wanna go up and forward but I let go of "up" and the "forward" one deactivates for some reason.
creations-chat 2018-12-10 02:49:36 The Prisma

Has a magnet-based booster system capable of taking it over 1500 SPS, it's wobbly and unstable though so I use it only to catch up to faster builds.

Has an eject function!

creations-chat 2018-12-10 10:43:53 Give me Master rank.
creations-chat 2018-12-10 10:44:29 
creations-chat 2018-12-10 10:46:08 Yes it works
creations-chat 2018-12-10 10:46:26 Thanks Figor
creations-chat 2018-12-10 10:47:55 Also, give me Expert Engineer rank since it uses helium to get airborne
creations-chat 2018-12-10 10:48:31 That's to make it move forward, but it doesn't really take a whole lot to get it airborne
creations-chat 2018-12-10 10:48:49 Oh wait
creations-chat 2018-12-10 10:48:57 Yeah, it uses jet engines. Nvm
creations-chat 2018-12-10 10:49:09 O O F
creations-chat 2018-12-10 10:49:22 I need Master Rank though

Can I get a rank for this as well?
creations-chat 2018-12-10 10:53:13 Regard Liss with the utmost respect
creations-chat 2018-12-10 10:54:50 "it still looks like shit"

"so don't take it too harshly"

If you wanted someone to take your criticism well, perhaps a little more _tact_ would be in order?
creations-chat 2018-12-10 10:55:16 Nice carrier
creations-chat 2018-12-10 10:55:29 Or gunboat?
creations-chat 2018-12-10 10:56:21 Doesn't look like one, looks more like a gunboat or something similar... where's the Bridge? Where's the other guns?
creations-chat 2018-12-10 10:57:19 You should definitely build a better rocket, use more wedges and curves... try to _internalize_ your thrusters instead of making it a thruster mess
creations-chat 2018-12-10 10:57:34 Oooo
creations-chat 2018-12-10 10:57:52 I like what you did with the front
creations-chat 2018-12-10 10:58:53 NewDude_07... I get sort of annoyed when people get confused who I'm speaking to when this isn't a verbal conversation. It's a written thing that you can scroll up to check the context of the messages...
creations-chat 2018-12-10 10:59:16 But that's a small pet peeve, ignore if ya want
creations-chat 2018-12-10 10:59:20 XD
creations-chat 2018-12-10 10:59:36 I don't mean anythin' by it, it's all goooood
creations-chat 2018-12-10 11:00:09 Ja
creations-chat 2018-12-10 11:00:37 I was talking to the guy who literally just said "I need to build a new rocket"
creations-chat 2018-12-10 11:00:50 Its in the chat, man
creations-chat 2018-12-10 11:01:27 C'mon man! C'mon bro! C'mon amigo! C'mon hombre! C'mon pal o' buddy o' friend-diddly of mine~!
creations-chat 2018-12-10 11:02:12 that was gay, i'll never do that again. Jesus _christ._
creations-chat 2018-12-10 11:03:04 So anyway... _Why don't I have my RANK YET!?_
creations-chat 2018-12-10 11:03:40 Give me the raaank! ***Where's my rank!?***
creations-chat 2018-12-10 11:40:39 <@!354786846049566720> I wasn't actually being impatient, I was actually just kidding you know
creations-chat 2018-12-10 11:40:59 I'm incredibly bored and I say silly things when I'm bored
creations-chat 2018-12-10 21:02:36 <@!295568493166985218> Hallo, can I have a rank plz?
creations-chat 2018-12-10 21:02:53 I don't really wanna repost a creation I did
creations-chat 2018-12-10 21:03:02 But it's over a 1000+ blocks
creations-chat 2018-12-10 21:04:23 Wait, its only a few scrollings up the <#384025409945337856> channel.

creations-chat 2018-12-13 06:25:06 But yeah, I'm so close to making a mech that doesn't need to repeatedly press W and S to semi-function
creations-chat 2018-12-13 06:25:51 I just need to probably offset the knee as well. Just like I offset the thigh area
creations-chat 2018-12-13 06:26:15 Ofc
creations-chat 2018-12-13 06:26:41 Not if I offset the motors to be not exactly center to the rotating block
creations-chat 2018-12-13 06:27:05 That's how I got it to do like I did in the video. I was only pressing W to go forward
creations-chat 2018-12-13 06:27:32 I use unpowered motors to make the "bendy" joint
creations-chat 2018-12-13 06:27:45 joints*

This is a mech joint. I won't tell how to make a proper mech as I want it to be exclusive... but this is the fruits of my "research" so far

creations-chat 2018-12-18 04:21:43 Nah, but I'm seriously close to make a functioning mech
creations-chat 2019-01-08 10:59:16 What makes you say that?
bug-reports 2019-10-28 09:33:46 Attaching Helium to section of the bot that uses Motor2s catapults the whole thing into outer space, sometimes to the Nineth Dimension...
bug-reports 2019-10-28 09:37:23 Fix: Reduce Torque of the Motor2s, I set mine to 0.2 for my experimental bipedal mech. Many months research!
creations-chat 2019-10-28 09:43:02 Imagine randomly blocking someone who's just trying to test and build a bipedal mech
creations-chat 2019-10-28 09:45:32 And yes, it walks and I found a way to make it turn without thrusters but it takes a bit
creations-chat 2019-10-31 04:55:03 Result of months of research, still need to research some more and I'll finally reach the perfect solution!

creations-chat 2019-10-31 04:57:03 Show me
creations-chat 2019-10-31 04:57:23 Not ones that use thrusters mind you
creations-chat 2019-10-31 04:58:48 The helium isn't a movement component though, it's purely for balance
creations-chat 2019-10-31 04:59:36 The people who posted their builds most likely painted over the helium as it's pretty much impossible to make a biped without helium and ballasts
creations-chat 2019-10-31 04:59:48 If they only use helium, the bot would float up
creations-chat 2019-10-31 05:00:08 If they only used ballasts, the bot's legs would barely lift off the ground
creations-chat 2019-10-31 05:00:26 And it'd shuffle awkwardly in place
creations-chat 2019-10-31 05:01:28 That's the thing, I'm avoiding thruster spam because its load and not legit
creations-chat 2019-10-31 05:01:35 loud*
creations-chat 2019-10-31 05:02:22 That's cool, but that thing looks kinda ugly though tbh
creations-chat 2019-10-31 05:02:31 It moves very fast though,
creations-chat 2019-10-31 05:02:38 I like how it functions
creations-chat 2019-10-31 05:02:55 But yeah, I've been doing this for practically a year myself
creations-chat 2019-10-31 05:03:36 Search up my name in history and you'll notice that I posted a prototype mech at 12/14/2018
creations-chat 2019-10-31 05:04:02 I just spent the time playing other games and making breakthroughs and fine tuning and whatnot
creations-chat 2019-10-31 05:04:57 But yeah, I'm not trying to argue whether I'm the first person to do it or not but I'm just showing that I made a more or less smooth Mech
creations-chat 2019-10-31 05:05:26 And it took me over a year of testing and testing
creations-chat 2019-10-31 05:05:43 Still have some things to iron out though
creations-chat 2019-10-31 05:06:18 That's cool
creations-chat 2019-10-31 05:06:47 Show me your's
creations-chat 2019-10-31 05:07:03 Oh wait
creations-chat 2019-10-31 05:07:08 Your's was the fast boi
creations-chat 2019-10-31 05:09:04 I used Motor2s set to a maxtorque of 0.5
creations-chat 2019-10-31 05:09:17 Anything above and they shake uncontrollably
creations-chat 2019-10-31 05:09:38 The trick to using Motor2s if they shake is to set their torque extremely low
creations-chat 2019-10-31 05:10:03 Same as your's for movement
creations-chat 2019-10-31 05:10:14 One button for forward and backwards
creations-chat 2019-10-31 05:10:24 A D
creations-chat 2019-10-31 05:11:03 But like I have to let go when the legs are at a certain position so that it can do a sharp turn even then its not perfect
creations-chat 2019-10-31 05:11:52 That's what I need to figure out
creations-chat 2019-10-31 05:12:09 And I refuse to use propellers or thrusters! No cheating for me!
creations-chat 2019-10-31 05:12:26 Im trying to use magnets since they're kinda cool though
creations-chat 2019-10-31 05:16:09 Maybe we can compare notes whenever
creations-chat 2019-10-31 05:16:13 lmao
creations-chat 2019-10-31 05:22:08 I don't know how to translate that to visuals, we can meet ingame some day
