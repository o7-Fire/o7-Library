creations-chat 2021-09-03 01:10:03 <@!467459282250629120> the problem with cylinder “gears” is that if u apply **L i t e r a l l y any** resistance, they slip
creations-chat 2021-09-03 01:29:22 I’m talkin about like slapping it on a car
creations-chat 2021-09-03 02:31:09 Oh, gg then

I’m the type of person that if it’s not perfect, I’m not happy. Even with my gears that are incredibly reliable, I’m not really too happy about them
