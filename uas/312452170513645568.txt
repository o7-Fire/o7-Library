bot-central 2020-09-30 11:10:13 -mapsuggest [add roads, highways and pavement in general around the map] It has been rough for some vehicles that can't ride the rough terrain without the assistance of pavement. Adding such features to the map will make vehicles such as trucks, cars and the like to traverse the landscape without being stuck in messy terrain. I would also like to mention that it would be appreciated if they were placed around the map and not just in one area like how train tracks are implemented in the current map. Bridges would be a great addition to this new map too as to improve the experience in PC as a whole.
