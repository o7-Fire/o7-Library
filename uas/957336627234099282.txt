the-dump 2023-05-03 22:51:50 ||HONDA CITY 1
In the beginning, Hondas,bmws,Toyotas,chevys, and others all lived in harmony, but then the fords arived. Nobody knows where the fords came from, but no-one Likes them, one Day places like Mclaren spaceport are untouched, in honda city, trillions of Hondas are happily going about there day, keeping the city-planet alive and thriving. But on another day, there could be a full scale invasion. One of those hondas are civicy.||
the-dump 2023-05-03 22:52:37 CHAPTER ONE: THE DELIVERY 
As Civicy Entered the porsche dart-ship, he knew he was in for a rough ride. Civicy was delivering a very important message from the core of honda city, he had to fly past ford planet to deliver the message, this message contained the finished Mclaren m-ship: the Mclaren M-SHIP Gen 5. The engines on the ship roared to life, the ship started to fly out of the dock, and started to shoot out of the planets atmosphere. Once out of the planet,civicy activated the hyperdrives, everything started to look elongated, until every star and planet looked like a line of white. The speedometer climber fast, until the ship reached maximum speed. It would take 3 hours to reach the Mclaren system, on the way there, there was a weird reading passing ford planet. It apeared what seemed like a small asteroid appeared on the radar, arriving at Mclaren spaceport, civicy dropped off the message, and started to go back hom message:
the-dump 2023-05-03 22:53:04 Im coping Honda city the first invasion into here
the-dump 2023-05-03 22:53:38 CHAPTER TWO: THE CORVETTE KINGS DEATH
Chevy planet was in panic. They knew about the other civilizations, but had no way to contact them. There one fleet of old spacecraft were already in use in deep space, and the corvette king, a C2, was dying. they had no idea why, and the C2 had no children to pass the ownership on to. As the corvette king slowly died, he passed on the ownership to his old friend, a chevy Silverado. This Silverado went on to develop a ship. This ship would carry the corvette kings heritage, he made the Journey to Honda city, after weeks of development, they came up with a ship. This ship would be called the Hondarium. Built in secret for months, the ship grew to over 12 miles long. The ship was so big, that when it flew out of the dock, the entire core over 2000 miles away could see the Hondarium take off, this ship was to serve both honda city as a military warship, and as a link to Chevy planet. Around the same time, the Mclaren M-SHIP Gen 5 finally was finished
the-dump 2023-05-03 22:53:59 Nope
the-dump 2023-05-03 22:54:23 Im coping this from my book im making
the-dump 2023-05-03 22:54:59 CHAPTER THREE: INVASION
Honda City is under attack! Hundreds of ford megaships are hovering over Honda City. If Honda city is to survive, Mclaren better drive quick with those M-Ships. But this was the time to test the Hondariums true power. The Hondarium launched from the dock, it was so big it dwarfed the ford megaships, all the Ford Ships imedetly took fire on the Hondarium but the Hondariums weapons destroyed the ford ships fast, thats when Mclaren arived with their M-ships to really change the battle. The fords panicked and retreated. Honda City was safe for another day.
the-dump 2023-05-03 22:55:23 : CHAPTER FOUR: BMW
BMW planet was not actually a planet, it was a moon orbiting a gas giant, BMW planet knew nothing about the other civilizations, and had very small ships, they had no hyperdrives, no weapons, no shields, and no armor. Bmw was curious one day, and decided to send radio waves to see if anyone was out there, Within minutes something happened, a jumble of different radio waves came on the detector, it appeared to be coming from a near-by star, the problem was, they had np way to get there‚Ä¶..
the-dump 2023-05-03 22:55:49 : CHAPTER FIVE: MERCEDES 
Mercedes was shipping out cargo tug number 225 on a delivery to Mclaren spaceport, all the Mercedes Benz 6*6 knew is that it was for something. Rumor had it that Mclaren was trying to make a large battleship, when suddenly a weird signal reached the ship, it wasn‚Äôt like anything he heard before, it was coming from a close star previously though to be unoccupied, when he got to Mclaren spaceport, he dropped off the cargo and headed to the star. When he got there, he found the signal to be coming from a gas giant. But thats not possible, a gas giant cant support life, thats when a moon was spotted, he slowly came apon the planet, and he noticed lights coming off the surface, he landed on a unusual platform on top of a tall building. Getting out of the cargo tug, the bmws guided him to the middle of the building, thats where the leader of the tower was,this was a lot different than any other place he had been in, instead of a cityscape surrounding the tower, it was just the tower standing miles above the surface, asking them why this was so, the leader of the bmws said: This place was once a wonderful place, until recently, they told him about a massive ship, they told him about how the ship destroyed 
Everything, leaving only a small selection of towers, and taking all of the resources themselves, This was a very strange thing he told them he was going to tell others about this strange accurance

the-dump 2023-05-03 22:57:12 CHAPTER FIVE: MERCEDES 
Mercedes was shipping out cargo tug number 225 on a delivery to Mclaren spaceport, all the Mercedes Benz 6*6 knew is that it was for something. Rumor had it that Mclaren was trying to make a large battleship, when suddenly a weird signal reached the ship, it wasn‚Äôt like anything he heard before, it was coming from a close star previously though to be unoccupied, when he got to Mclaren spaceport, he dropped off the cargo and headed to the star. When he got there, he found the signal to be coming from a gas giant. But thats not possible, a gas giant cant support life, thats when a moon was spotted, he slowly came apon the planet, and he noticed lights coming off the surface, he landed on a unusual platform on top of a tall building. Getting out of the cargo tug, the bmws guided him to the middle of the building, thats where the leader of the tower was,this was a lot different than any other place he had been in, instead of a cityscape surrounding the tower, it was just the tower standing miles above the surface, asking them why this was so, the leader of the bmws said: This place was once a wonderful place, until recently, they told him about a massive ship, they told him about how the ship destroyed 
Everything, leaving only a small selection of towers, and taking all of the resources themselves, This was a very strange thing he told them he was going to tell others about this strange accurance
