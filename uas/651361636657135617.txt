the-dump 2021-11-14 14:22:00 Hey guys did you know that in terms of human companionship, flareon is the most huggable pokemon? Although their maximum temperature is likely too much for most humans, they are capable of controlling it, so they can set themselves to the perfect temperature for you. Along whit that, they have a lot of fluff, making them undeniably incredibly soft to touch. But that's not all… they have a very respectable special defence at 110, which means they are likely very calm and resistant to emotional damage. Because of this, if you have a bad day, you can vent to it while hugging it, and it wont mind. It can make itself even more endearing with moves like charm and baby doll eyes, ensuring that you never have a prolonged bout of depression ever again

events-chat 2022-01-09 03:14:12 Untracking rockets to the bridge of the boat will end the entire thing since vip servers are different from public pvp and you actually die from explosions

events-chat 2022-01-14 06:23:54 Misinformation
The old rockets are better. New rockets are worse because of a side effect from fixing a rare bug where the rockets would go missing after firing
events-chat 2022-01-14 06:24:33 Legacy is old missile default is new missile
events-chat 2022-01-14 06:25:13 Legacy ones are better but if you fire them and they go missing make them default rockets
events-chat 2022-01-14 06:25:52 Yes
events-chat 2022-01-14 06:26:09 As I said rare bug so it won’t appear often but when it does appear do that
events-chat 2022-01-14 06:26:59 In this case you do want legacy, because legacy rockets actually have a larger blast radius
events-chat 2022-01-14 06:27:30 It never affected tracking

events-chat 2022-01-19 22:45:06 You can’t flip my mech
events-chat 2022-01-19 22:45:30 I can get rested on the side but if I ~~fly~~ strafe into the air the mech will go upright
events-chat 2022-01-19 22:47:10 I think his mech little helium and unstable
events-chat 2022-01-19 22:47:55 My mech is like 9.5 blocks tall
events-chat 2022-01-19 22:49:01 My mech 9.5 tall 7 or 5 wide can’t remember and 5 thick
events-chat 2022-01-19 22:49:34 Assuming everyone’s pilot seat is in the head I’ll just axe kick the head
events-chat 2022-01-19 22:49:57 You cant disarm my mech since the mech is the weapon
If it’s in the torso I’ll just kick there then
events-chat 2022-01-19 22:50:26 Oh yea I’ll just use recoil to escape
events-chat 2022-01-19 22:50:55 I forgot about recoil so I actually added a back booster to escape
events-chat 2022-01-19 22:51:23 Oh ye his recoil is gonna kill him
events-chat 2022-01-19 22:51:52 Fyi your recoil gonna be very big
events-chat 2022-01-19 22:52:09 You can’t anchor for more than 4 second
events-chat 2022-01-19 22:53:17 People don’t just stand there
events-chat 2022-01-19 22:53:59 Me
Not slow
events-chat 2022-01-19 23:06:14 It used to be called exp in old rpg games tho
events-chat 2022-01-20 04:03:52 my mech small enough for people to ask if im part of small mech project kek
events-chat 2022-01-20 08:26:51 I want to test battle someone later
events-chat 2022-01-20 08:34:11 I just had a scare yes
events-chat 2022-01-20 08:34:32 No
1% battery left
events-chat 2022-01-20 08:35:00 The scare was I have sore throat and runny nose and pretty normal for me
events-chat 2022-01-20 08:35:18 Until I couldn’t taste the drink I just bought
events-chat 2022-01-20 08:35:39 (Covid) but I have my taste back now I think
events-chat 2022-01-20 08:35:57 So I don’t think I have
events-chat 2022-01-20 08:36:16 Idk if I have or no because I couldn’t taste until I could
events-chat 2022-01-20 08:36:38 Agreed
events-chat 2022-01-20 08:37:05 Im going home to get one rapid test but it’s not as accurate so ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
events-chat 2022-01-20 08:37:57 Hopefully I don’t die 👍
events-chat 2022-01-20 08:38:18 If I suddenly go offline for more than a week you’ll know what happened
events-chat 2022-01-20 09:05:30 Use your event mech to fight me
events-chat 2022-01-20 09:06:35 Never mind I do covid self test first
events-chat 2022-01-20 09:15:55 Ok now
events-chat 2022-01-20 09:18:31 ._.
events-chat 2022-01-20 09:19:28 Expert 2
events-chat 2022-01-20 09:19:46 Less people less lag
events-chat 2022-01-20 09:24:35 I disconnected
<:ElonSad:573361014112780303>
events-chat 2022-01-20 09:25:06 And how did I take off your hands
events-chat 2022-01-20 09:25:28 Did I kick them off or chop them off with the blade
events-chat 2022-01-20 09:28:25 My right arm actually
events-chat 2022-01-20 09:28:42 And I was in the midst of attacking as well
events-chat 2022-01-20 09:28:59 And I was carving away at your leg as well lma
events-chat 2022-01-20 09:29:16 I just realised I don’t have enough rocket boosters so I’ll add more
events-chat 2022-01-20 09:29:34 Not speedy enough kek
events-chat 2022-01-20 09:29:52 An actual sword will unbalance the whole thing
events-chat 2022-01-20 09:30:10 Mine is just choppers
events-chat 2022-01-20 09:30:27 Jumping allowed
events-chat 2022-01-20 09:30:46 I don’t just go all the way up without stopping lol
events-chat 2022-01-20 09:31:02 Tho I have rockets to help me strafe around the place
events-chat 2022-01-20 10:33:12 I think the mech will be very deadly once I practice with it more
events-chat 2022-01-20 10:33:37 For now strongest attack is to jump on top of the opponent and chop away
events-chat 2022-01-20 12:58:31 Ok can I practice mech fight with you again
events-chat 2022-01-20 12:58:49 I’ll be waiting in exp2
events-chat 2022-01-20 13:36:49 Had a battle just now didn’t do very good because I couldn’t press the tiny buttons
events-chat 2022-01-20 13:37:25 If I could press the buttons I would’ve dodged the attack and wouldn’t have died within 5 seconds of battle starting
events-chat 2022-01-21 02:36:35 Hi
events-chat 2022-01-21 02:36:53 Vinh told me to make sword speed 5 and I want to see the damage changes
events-chat 2022-01-21 02:37:33 No I already did it I want to see how the damage changes
events-chat 2022-01-21 02:37:50 What’s that

events-chat 2022-01-21 10:22:03 Again
events-chat 2022-01-21 12:08:28 Dead chat

events-chat 2022-01-21 13:44:08 How do you even vibrate stick
events-chat 2022-01-21 13:44:25 (I will use cos not enough damage)
events-chat 2022-01-21 13:45:12 Or should I just make a new mech and figure out how to make it not need to use 5 keybinds at once to move the sword
events-chat 2022-01-21 13:45:32 Mobile forever at a disadvantage smh
events-chat 2022-01-21 13:45:53 Or do I use keyboard <:thchoink:527880803456122891>
events-chat 2022-01-21 13:46:11 It’s a weapon showcase he doesn’t make it for event

events-chat 2022-01-21 13:47:57 (I win)
events-chat 2022-01-21 13:54:18 No to raise sword and swing it around
events-chat 2022-01-21 13:54:50 M
events-chat 2022-01-21 13:57:13 Ok found your YouTube channel eas
events-chat 2022-01-21 15:18:54 I need to learn how to jump on to peoples heads
events-chat 2022-01-21 15:19:12 I can only deal damage that way
events-chat 2022-01-21 15:32:15 Yes
events-chat 2022-01-21 16:46:16 No
events-chat 2022-01-21 16:47:01 Not done yet, and I lost all the practise 1v1s because I don’t have experience mech fighting so ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
events-chat 2022-01-21 18:32:31 What always happens
events-chat 2022-01-21 18:32:57 And I learnt that touching something with a cutter does a lot of damage (I went to pvp mode with my mech today)
events-chat 2022-01-23 15:26:48 Because mech will never be easy to control unless one day someone manages to invent brain input and keyboard is no longer needed and is obsolete
events-chat 2022-01-23 15:47:13 2 buttons to swing sword 4 buttons to adjust arm position
events-chat 2022-01-23 16:30:46 Just mirror arm action for lazy people <:trollface:775024642104229898>
events-chat 2022-01-23 16:31:41 Hm
events-chat 2022-01-23 16:32:00 Haha lmao

events-chat 2022-01-26 11:57:29 Where
events-chat 2022-01-26 14:26:27 My mech doesn’t fly I swear it only jumps but I can boost myself in the air
events-chat 2022-01-26 14:26:44 It doesn’t fly
events-chat 2022-01-26 14:48:50 So what does jumping look like
events-chat 2022-01-26 14:50:04 Cos I don’t wanna shoot up into sky and have you say that I’m flying
events-chat 2022-01-27 05:40:45 <:trollface:775024642104229898>
events-chat 2022-01-27 05:41:31 My mech so tiny 3-4 seconds is enough to go up to 300 studs
events-chat 2022-01-27 05:41:48 I say prop engines
events-chat 2022-01-27 05:42:05 Altitude measured in studs I think
events-chat 2022-01-27 05:42:50 Ask prototrode for the script
events-chat 2022-01-27 05:43:15 Guns are fine
events-chat 2022-01-27 05:43:34 Ww2 has rockets and jets
events-chat 2022-01-27 05:43:53 Guns are fine for Low speed dogfights
They are effective for up to like around 120 sps or so
events-chat 2022-01-27 05:44:42 Me
events-chat 2022-01-27 05:45:07 No jet engines
events-chat 2022-01-27 05:46:01 My plane of 140 blocks moves at a decent speed with a normal prop engine what are you talking about
events-chat 2022-01-27 05:46:17 150 lmao
events-chat 2022-01-27 05:47:00 150 speed pls
events-chat 2022-01-27 05:47:18 It is a very good speed for Low speed dogfight it’s very trackable as well
events-chat 2022-01-27 05:47:41 Someone already did it
events-chat 2022-01-27 10:21:53 You’re in public pvp, that’s what <:FineTroll:626841259746656289>
events-chat 2022-01-27 13:34:14 My mech can walk but I never walk with my mech lmao I just jump around cos it’s faster

events-chat 2022-01-28 23:35:37 And I need to account for lag when I do my dodges I can’t just rely on eyes now 💀
events-chat 2022-01-29 01:49:53 
events-chat 2022-01-29 06:35:12 Moo
events-chat 2022-01-29 16:43:51 How are tourney guys even chosen
events-chat 2022-01-29 16:44:15 Randomly or what
events-chat 2022-01-29 16:48:37 Funny how all contestants rn are experts
events-chat 2022-01-29 16:52:30 They are on a bracket
events-chat 2022-01-29 16:52:46 But the first row is randomly generated pretty sure
events-chat 2022-01-29 16:56:08 Uh
What
events-chat 2022-01-29 16:56:59 My mech is gonna die in one hit but I can dodge quite fast so idk
events-chat 2022-01-29 16:57:43 (I haven’t practiced in a long time so ima do now)
events-chat 2022-01-29 17:03:52 I can do backflips
events-chat 2022-01-29 17:04:55 I don’t need to flip
events-chat 2022-01-29 17:05:33 If I ever fall over(quite hard to do so) I can spam a few random keybinds and it’ll get back up
events-chat 2022-01-29 17:06:01 I can take advantage of that
events-chat 2022-01-29 17:06:43 If you take a look at my submission you’ll actually realise that you’re unable to hit me
events-chat 2022-01-29 17:07:16 I’m still smaller than you <:KEKW:670310537300672528>
events-chat 2022-01-29 17:07:33 Just don’t get hit very simple
events-chat 2022-01-29 17:09:06 I use phone so if I miss a keybind I’m dead
events-chat 2022-01-29 17:10:22 Actually your sword has a very funny blind spot
events-chat 2022-01-29 17:10:53 Not the back
events-chat 2022-01-29 17:11:10 I won’t tell you <:FineTroll:626841259746656289>
events-chat 2022-01-29 17:14:16 Don’t worry I can do backflip
events-chat 2022-01-29 17:16:26 Yes
events-chat 2022-01-29 17:17:12 No it can’t
No matter how hard I try I can’t make it do headstand it’ll just stand back up straight
events-chat 2022-01-29 17:17:29 He’s a straight mf
events-chat 2022-01-29 17:17:50 I’ll go pvp mode with my mech xd
events-chat 2022-01-29 17:18:08 You can join me if you want bog
events-chat 2022-01-29 18:50:33 Ok mech fight soon
events-chat 2022-01-29 20:19:48 Did you know that they presumed me dead
While I still had cutters
events-chat 2022-01-29 20:20:23 I made a mistake by jumping cos I was too short for him to hit
events-chat 2022-01-29 20:20:47 Shouldn’t have jumped and should’ve continued headbutting ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
events-chat 2022-01-29 20:23:44 I didn’t quite “die”
events-chat 2022-01-29 20:24:01 I still had cutter to headbutt him lma
events-chat 2022-01-29 20:24:19 Toast
But his below reach was so short he couldn’t hit my mech
events-chat 2022-01-29 20:24:51 He managed to remove my sword but not my head
So I went bonk
events-chat 2022-01-29 20:25:14 Idk
events-chat 2022-01-29 20:25:31 Ima go sleep bye
events-chat 2022-01-30 04:27:36 Lma
events-chat 2022-01-30 04:27:57 How does the spy crab even run that fast it’s terrifying
events-chat 2022-01-30 04:28:23 Hahah knew it
events-chat 2022-01-30 04:28:43 It was just pure carpal tunnel
events-chat 2022-01-30 04:29:21 You see a pic I took of me lagging
events-chat 2022-01-30 04:29:44 Apparently lag breaks the mobile buttons so I was stationary ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
events-chat 2022-01-30 04:30:11 8 is fine number
events-chat 2022-01-30 04:30:28 Bru why rockets make it a biplane fight pls
events-chat 2022-01-30 04:32:03 Just turn off tracking as both rockets have equally shitty tracking
events-chat 2022-01-30 04:32:47 But I recommend no rocket and max of 1 firework
events-chat 2022-01-30 04:33:16 I don’t care <:KEKW:670310537300672528>
events-chat 2022-01-30 04:33:39 If you line up a good shot it’ll instantly demolish so don’t argue with me
events-chat 2022-01-30 04:34:20 Keep it within the whole island
events-chat 2022-01-30 04:34:38 Precisely why we should have it
events-chat 2022-01-30 04:35:25 Firework have quite slow reload
events-chat 2022-01-30 04:36:17 They have 8 shots, delay between each shot is about 2/3 of a second and after the 8 shots there’s like a reload period
events-chat 2022-01-30 04:37:22 Fireworks not op or you’re gay <:trollface:775024642104229898>
events-chat 2022-01-30 04:38:23 Bruh no fuck you
events-chat 2022-01-30 04:38:47 I’m gonna do another mech battle bullshittery and make it incredibly tiny again
events-chat 2022-01-30 04:39:18 Same
events-chat 2022-01-30 04:39:38 TIL lag completely stops mobile buttons from working
events-chat 2022-01-30 04:40:04 51x51x39

events-chat 2022-01-30 04:56:25 6am manageable I think

events-chat 2022-01-30 04:57:20 But I want to sleep on weekend
So i won’t wake up at 5am like on school day
events-chat 2022-01-30 04:59:29 For plane events don’t randomly pick and pick those submissions that look good so they look good for camera
events-chat 2022-01-30 05:00:16 Lol last night they screamed at my mech for having creative mode in the events vc
How funny <:KEKW:670310537300672528>

events-chat 2022-01-30 05:05:52 Ok deal
events-chat 2022-01-30 05:06:26 Low speed dogfights are fun and feel more realistic
events-chat 2022-01-30 05:07:09 Mhm yes your whole ushp unable to hit me <:KEKW:670310537300672528>
events-chat 2022-01-30 05:07:39 Yes

events-chat 2022-01-30 05:18:28 Allow tail gunners but the max angle of the motor2 is 25 degrees in every direction
events-chat 2022-01-30 05:19:34 Just allow tail gunner but have very limited angle or something

events-chat 2022-01-30 05:20:30 And why the slowmode it’s very annoying when trying to suggest things
events-chat 2022-01-30 05:23:44 F86 Sabre vs MiG-15
events-chat 2022-01-30 05:24:44 Prop planes only
events-chat 2022-01-30 05:28:33 Too small
events-chat 2022-01-30 05:28:54 Contain the battle within the map

events-chat 2022-01-30 06:04:24 Yea same
events-chat 2022-01-30 06:04:48 Ban the event winners from joining events for 4 events maybe
events-chat 2022-01-30 06:05:53 What exposed lock 
I only see detail
events-chat 2022-01-30 06:06:44 They are blind
events-chat 2022-01-30 06:07:02 There’s no exposed lock, only detail
events-chat 2022-01-30 06:13:59 Yo Spanish
events-chat 2022-01-30 06:14:17 I do chinese <:FineTroll:626841259746656289>
events-chat 2022-01-30 06:35:40 Motorlock is allowed you dumbass
events-chat 2022-01-30 06:36:14 People mistaking motorlock for a glitch like a dumbass be like
events-chat 2022-01-30 09:21:39 <@!466793357318815744> don’t allow pvp rockets because they can remove wings rather easily
events-chat 2022-01-30 09:22:29 Hmm true
events-chat 2022-01-30 09:23:13 Don’t worry I’ll think of a way to hit every time
events-chat 2022-01-30 09:24:06 We do?
events-chat 2022-01-30 09:24:29 I thought was ban
They are banned reread the rules you dimwit
events-chat 2022-01-30 09:25:15 Bean
events-chat 2022-01-30 09:26:08 No
events-chat 2022-01-30 09:26:32 It’s rule
events-chat 2022-01-30 09:28:44 That means rbk doesn’t feel like allowing pvp rocket
events-chat 2022-01-30 09:38:07 Someone from team make an airfield and conveyor it like 10000 studs out or something
events-chat 2022-01-30 09:38:28 Or maybe the bomber maker makes airfield
events-chat 2022-01-30 09:40:34 According to the message only hosts can make bomber
events-chat 2022-01-30 09:40:53 So probably a YouTuber makes the bombers
events-chat 2022-01-30 09:41:21 …
events-chat 2022-01-30 09:41:39 Speed limit is 300 for fighters so I don’t get why you would make a jet
events-chat 2022-01-30 09:42:07 Max speed is the speed limit
events-chat 2022-01-30 09:43:10 Skill issue
events-chat 2022-01-30 09:43:39 This event is all about slow paced fighting
events-chat 2022-01-30 09:44:05 You just don’t understand how enjoyable it is to not face sweats flying at 5k speed
events-chat 2022-01-30 09:44:39 You just do slow turns and actually have time to aim instead of doing the funny shots and having 0.0000002 seconds to line up a shot
events-chat 2022-01-30 09:45:28 You clearly haven’t seen prop fighters dogfighting
events-chat 2022-01-30 09:46:34 If you’re talking modern literally just fire a missile after radar lock
events-chat 2022-01-30 09:47:12 I can do plenty of weird things at 150 speed so you definitely haven’t fought at slow speed before
events-chat 2022-01-30 09:47:55 5x5 space
Definitely larger you dimwit
events-chat 2022-01-30 09:49:14 Fast paced is intense, so it’s not enjoyable 
It’s more of sweating your entire bladder out than actually having fun
events-chat 2022-01-30 09:49:52 If you guys enjoy running from a murderer then ok
events-chat 2022-01-30 09:50:11 Running from a murderer is intense isn’t it
events-chat 2022-01-30 09:51:08 They have skill issue and can’t get a plane flying and manuvering well at 300
events-chat 2022-01-30 09:51:25 But they just deny it
events-chat 2022-01-30 09:52:09 So why are you complaining about “can’t do funny things to dodge”
events-chat 2022-01-30 09:53:36 I said if you can’t make it manoeuvre well at 300 you have skill issue
events-chat 2022-01-30 09:56:18 Skill issue
events-chat 2022-01-30 09:57:04 What else do you want me to say if you don’t give a detailed analysis of problem
events-chat 2022-01-30 09:58:22 If it stalls at 300 when turning it’s probably just high aoa
events-chat 2022-01-30 10:07:22 And more wing panels, make plane lighter, use super rocket engines because hover engines typically are low power high speed engines while super rockets are more powerful and produce more pushing power
events-chat 2022-01-30 10:07:50 O right
events-chat 2022-01-30 10:08:14 Use normal rocket engines and hovers are banned too cos they are glitch engines so ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
events-chat 2022-01-30 10:08:35 Hover engines banned
Good luck 👍
events-chat 2022-01-30 10:09:19 
events-chat 2022-01-30 10:09:39 .

events-chat 2022-01-30 10:15:55 And just pull off all nighter the event is on weekend anyway
events-chat 2022-01-30 10:16:15 I’ve been mobile flying since laptop died so no excuse <:FineTroll:626841259746656289>
events-chat 2022-01-30 10:16:52 I did the mech fights on mobile too, somehow made it to the second round <:KEKW:670310537300672528>
events-chat 2022-01-30 10:17:36 Mobile flight very similar to pc flight just have a good and comfortable button layout that fits your hand size
events-chat 2022-01-30 10:18:19 If you’re host you need to do commentary for twitch stream <:KEKW:670310537300672528>
events-chat 2022-01-30 10:18:40 <:ElonSad:573361014112780303>
events-chat 2022-01-30 10:19:22 Too troublesome to set up a soundboard just for this
events-chat 2022-01-30 10:19:40 Unless rbk gonna use for future events
But we don’t even know if rbk will keep up with the number of events we having atm
events-chat 2022-01-30 10:20:24 Like event after event after event with like only at most 3 days break between one start and end
events-chat 2022-01-30 10:34:38 Hover engines are banned
On the other hand, hover drives are a glitch engine and therefore is banned
events-chat 2022-01-30 10:35:19 So don’t try to be funny and go “haha hover go brr”
events-chat 2022-01-30 10:35:53 If the piston gets broken it most likely won’t crash, unless piston isn’t locked and so that’ll crash
events-chat 2022-01-30 10:36:43 I use locked pistons for a lot of my stuff as well
Custom spaced guns 💪
events-chat 2022-01-30 10:37:46 Should I cylinder cockpit for this event
events-chat 2022-01-30 10:38:03 Cos I wanna keep the shinden for myself as personal build
events-chat 2022-01-30 11:11:53 Glitch engines are so hovers facing an unwelded motor is
events-chat 2022-01-30 11:56:09 A glitch is a glitch, doesn’t matter if it’s fast or slow
events-chat 2022-01-30 11:57:27 Ok nice
events-chat 2022-01-30 12:00:44 They used premade plane
events-chat 2022-01-30 12:01:40 As I said hover engines very weak lmao
events-chat 2022-01-30 12:02:07 +fireworks
events-chat 2022-01-30 12:02:29 He has plenty of fireworks
events-chat 2022-01-30 12:03:26 Don’t think he read the rules*
events-chat 2022-01-30 12:03:44 He only saw the word “plane”
events-chat 2022-01-30 12:37:57 Because slow means prop plane
events-chat 2022-01-30 12:56:41 Yes
events-chat 2022-01-30 16:00:07 I making shinden but the air intakes giving me trouble
events-chat 2022-01-30 17:28:45 Earlier today someone was complaining about how slow planes can’t manuvere at all
events-chat 2022-01-30 22:12:03 Ofc pistons allowed
events-chat 2022-01-30 22:12:23 We have to pistonlock
events-chat 2022-01-30 22:12:44 Half piston lock is glitched and cause fling to happen
events-chat 2022-01-30 22:13:24 You can try make a thing out of locked half pistons and then annoy people by touching their build but I recommend no
events-chat 2022-01-30 22:13:53 Because general annoyance but you send them to the 23rd dimension on a good fling <:trollface:775024642104229898>
events-chat 2022-01-30 23:11:21 Bombs for midair bombing <:KEKW:670310537300672528>

events-chat 2022-01-31 13:29:46 And then ask them if they have other game recommendations that are free(so they don’t constantly ask you to play minecraft)
events-chat 2022-01-31 14:53:53 One single motor that is locked is a lot of work
events-chat 2022-01-31 14:54:13 Amazing
events-chat 2022-01-31 14:54:40 To line up gun with trail all you need to do is a single locked motor
events-chat 2022-01-31 14:55:11 Then lock them smh

events-chat 2022-01-31 14:56:23 Because idk
events-chat 2022-01-31 16:06:21 Should I have landing gear (quite hard to hide in the wings)
events-chat 2022-01-31 17:12:18 Same
events-chat 2022-01-31 19:31:21 Hm
events-chat 2022-01-31 19:33:12 Do your spitfire have landing gear
events-chat 2022-01-31 19:33:48 Oh I see it
events-chat 2022-01-31 19:34:05 It’s badly hidden and badly placed but I’ll do it as well lma
events-chat 2022-01-31 19:34:41 Shinden has weird landing gear
events-chat 2022-01-31 19:34:59 So I’ll do something similar but with custom landing gear
events-chat 2022-01-31 19:36:01 I want to take off like a normal plane so I’ll do it
events-chat 2022-01-31 20:01:18 Fucking triggers

events-chat 2022-02-01 04:08:12 One includes a p51d
events-chat 2022-02-01 04:09:39 I’ll just remember it
events-chat 2022-02-01 04:10:35 Mine has good shape and proportion but bad look overall lma
events-chat 2022-02-01 04:11:09 This is why it’s vital to hide lock in this event
events-chat 2022-02-01 04:11:39 Which is what I’m doing with my shinden rn and hiding every bit of lock i can hide
events-chat 2022-02-01 04:11:58 So far so good
No lock exposed (yet)
events-chat 2022-02-01 04:13:07 Lma
Anyways my shinden is very weird flight characteristic
events-chat 2022-02-01 04:14:10 If I can’t get my shinden done within event time I’ll just bring out my funny biplane
events-chat 2022-02-01 04:19:47 I have a f16 next to me (not assembled)

events-chat 2022-02-03 13:26:49 Then make a better one that doesn’t get absolutely decimated <:FineTroll:626841259746656289>
events-chat 2022-02-03 13:27:52 They made it random because idiots like you tend to become unlucky and not get selected so they pray
events-chat 2022-02-03 13:29:29 So you having skill issue can’t make a mech <:KEKW:670310537300672528> therefore didn’t even try making for the mech event

events-chat 2022-02-09 11:06:31 But having a whole squad of Japanese pretty funny isn’t it
events-chat 2022-02-09 11:09:40 Wow I used that pic for my history project on types of Japanese propaganda used during ww2

events-chat 2022-02-09 16:28:59 am gonna use yousuf chungus bomber but modify it to become badly made b36
events-chat 2022-02-09 16:30:43 Since can’t change much about design I can only make the b36 short b36
events-chat 2022-02-09 22:14:34 <@!335599526414909451> You underestimate my ability to go FASTER

events-chat 2022-02-10 20:18:47 Event rules don’t say no custom control surface
events-chat 2022-02-11 08:30:11 You have many option with bomber
events-chat 2022-02-11 08:45:06 Nein
events-chat 2022-02-11 08:45:33 Don’t you see my bomber 
I modified it so much it doesn’t even resemble original anymore but it all fits into the restrictions so there’s no problem
events-chat 2022-02-11 10:09:32 yes
events-chat 2022-02-11 10:09:49 gt my friend
he saw ingame
events-chat 2022-02-11 15:01:47 Yes
events-chat 2022-02-11 15:02:25 It creates piss and jets it out the bottom so it shit on carrier and writes “poo”
events-chat 2022-02-11 16:25:49 You created a bomber that can fly without a wing
events-chat 2022-02-11 16:26:06 How do you feel about that
events-chat 2022-02-11 16:26:37 Hm who did then
events-chat 2022-02-11 16:27:05 Anyways praise whichever mod who made it cos the bomber has like the highest survivability I’ve ever seen
events-chat 2022-02-11 16:27:21 For a bomber that is
events-chat 2022-02-11 16:27:38 Ok but like I can do a cobruh and missile you head on <:trollface:775024642104229898>
events-chat 2022-02-11 16:28:05 Ok but like I have control surfaces so I can dodge as well
events-chat 2022-02-11 16:28:22 And your ass gonna be too slow to dodge a turret
events-chat 2022-02-11 16:28:39 You forgot that the bomber has turret yes
events-chat 2022-02-11 16:32:34 Biplane so scary, energy retention of a piece of paper
events-chat 2022-02-11 16:34:06 It slows down so much in a turn unlike bomber
events-chat 2022-02-11 16:34:35 My bomber retains 100 speed while turning normal cruise speed 128
events-chat 2022-02-11 16:34:53 That’s great because turret
events-chat 2022-02-11 16:37:13 Actually yes
events-chat 2022-02-11 16:37:34 I went out in pvp and bomber still flying without wings <:trollface:775024642104229898>
events-chat 2022-02-11 16:38:11 I’m gonna give it bomb instead of missile now cos the incentive of being able to repair is really good
events-chat 2022-02-11 16:39:06 Americans not realising what thing dropped a nuke
events-chat 2022-02-11 16:47:19 Ah yes a 10 block wide hole is nothing
events-chat 2022-02-11 16:47:36 <@!739369649971527720> could you conduct some anti air bombing
events-chat 2022-02-11 16:47:53 It changed its 5 and I’m gonna do a little dive bombing
events-chat 2022-02-11 16:48:10 Why not bru

events-chat 2022-02-11 16:48:51 It doesn’t bounce far, roblox physics don’t work that way
events-chat 2022-02-11 16:49:28 Would be quite funny if I refused to drop my tnt and just melee the carrier fold
events-chat 2022-02-11 16:49:44 The hosts better hide the fold well lma
events-chat 2022-02-11 16:50:11 What if I remove the magnet

We continue discussion tomorrow if I remmebrr to continue the discussion
events-chat 2022-02-11 22:57:50 Bruh the mods fucking lied
Bomber isn’t slow and sluggish, it’s just slow but manuveres like a fucking fighter
events-chat 2022-02-12 06:30:02 There’s a reason no one is using motorlock or motorlocked bomb and if you’re trolling you’re horrible at it
events-chat 2022-02-12 08:40:59 Lma

events-chat 2022-05-14 17:11:24 Right before that battle I went ahead to improve the arm and what I got was a fling glitch
events-chat 2022-05-14 17:17:31 No, the guy I fought used real tracks so the tracks glitched out and sniped me from half the plot away twice
events-chat 2022-05-14 17:17:59 And hyperbit decided that it was cos of my skill issue that I cannot deal with a fling glitch
events-chat 2022-05-14 17:22:40 No
I’m a spinner not a hammer
events-chat 2022-05-14 17:27:33 No I didn’t get fling by my own spinner, my bot is too heavy for that
events-chat 2022-05-15 05:09:26 I still got glitched out after one hit <:m_:778994206948589638>
events-chat 2022-05-15 05:09:45 And I’m as heavy as minty chomp I think
events-chat 2022-05-15 10:55:15 I didn’t glitch out, opponent did <:m_:778994206948589638>
events-chat 2022-05-15 10:55:32 You know how tracks separate from the actual wheel sometimes
events-chat 2022-05-15 13:51:28 how much does a ballast beam weight again <:clueless:942802644043464734>
events-chat 2022-05-15 13:53:23 each ballast beam weigh about 142 blocks so i am indeed just lighter than you (2500 block thing)

creations-chat 2022-05-23 22:23:07 I didn’t upvote it because there were a few that already looked exactly the same from the past

Why the suspension though
the-dump 2022-11-23 14:15:19 The year is 2025.

Plane Crazy has died. Everyone secretly thought it would happen, but never like this. No players remain online. The only sign of life occuring when both SR_B3N6828 and themorfix45 join to compare the same 15 builds and techniques back and forth with each other. Occasionally a new player will join this once populated game, exploring the different mechanics and available blocks, wondering where it all went wrong. Rickje139 has not been seen or heard from since 2022, only sometimes updating his Discord status to "working hard on Plane Crazy update".  Who would've thought it would come to this. Everyone joked, sure, but it is all too real when it actually happens. Slowly and silently, Plane Crazy drifts to the backpages of Roblox. New generations of building games enjoy golden eras, completely oblivious to what once was.

the-dump 2022-11-23 16:40:06 Doesn’t it cost like upwards of 1k
the-dump 2022-11-23 16:54:29 Pure sodium chloride, 0 impurities
the-dump 2022-11-23 16:54:42 Just NaCl•xH2O
the-dump 2022-11-23 17:00:45 Possible
the-dump 2022-11-23 17:01:09 Put excess sodium in hydrochloric acid
the-dump 2022-11-23 17:01:25 wait no
the-dump 2022-11-23 17:01:28 This is troublesome
the-dump 2022-11-23 17:03:32 2Na + 2HCL —> 2NaCl + H2
Excess water left
2H2O + 2Na —> 2NaOH + H2

the-dump 2022-11-23 17:03:37 Chemistry
the-dump 2022-11-23 17:04:05 How do you separate saltwater from alkaline water
the-dump 2022-11-23 17:06:48 <@495210490172014612> how
the-dump 2022-11-23 17:07:23 I think I saw someone said that
the-dump 2022-11-23 17:07:40 If you put more alkali then white powder appear
the-dump 2022-11-23 17:07:57 Because too much hydroxide so the salt appears as a powder cos too high concentration
the-dump 2022-11-23 17:08:09 Then just filter out the salt
the-dump 2022-11-23 17:08:13 Salt powder
