plane-crazy 2020-07-17 13:34:11 has anyone here played halo 3?
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 17:48:12 but I know the basic design now
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 17:48:06 worked*
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 17:48:04 had to copy the legs because I had no idea how to make decent looking ones that worked or even ones that worke
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 17:47:51 my mech looks so trash
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 17:47:41 guessing lava spitters work too
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 17:47:35 it works now
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 17:47:30 rejoined, didn't work
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 17:47:28 didn't work
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 17:47:27 I turned them on
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 17:47:26 I did
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 17:47:19 thanks for the help
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 17:47:04 maybe the particles just weren't loading
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 17:46:55 h thank god
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 17:46:55 AND MY ROCKETS WORK
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 17:46:42 gonna check if my lava spitters work
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 17:46:33 they've decided to work
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 17:45:55 I'm using smoke pipes as well as lava spitters to get the flamethrower effect but neither work as it is
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 17:45:28 gonna go back in and see if it works now but I have rejoined several times
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 17:45:16 yeah
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 17:45:14 and I checked guns
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 17:45:12 the rockets fired just fine
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 17:45:05 I meant
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 17:45:05 rocket ENGINES
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 17:45:01 I mean
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 17:44:47 alright
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 17:44:45 half my weapons don't work and my mech can't run any faster
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 17:44:39 yeah
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 17:44:27 nor do my rockets
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 17:44:25 nor do my lava spitters
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 17:44:23 and they dont fire at all
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 17:44:20 but I had someone else look
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 17:44:17 turned particles to always and everything
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 17:44:07 they dont work
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 17:44:06 so I set them to F
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 17:44:03 alright
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 17:43:47 do you have to be in PVP for smoke pipes?
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 17:43:37 I was anwyay
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 17:43:36 yeah
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 17:43:26 even though they're set in the right keybind and everything
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 17:43:21 half the things on this thing don't trigger
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 17:43:13 except the rockets on the feet dont work
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 17:43:10 it's fine design wise
