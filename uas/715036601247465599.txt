<@!515017963661950976>
creations-chat 2020-10-27 06:02:24 ikr----- the wedges dont achieve some weird shapes and its hard to work with
creations-chat 2020-10-27 07:43:09 we need quarter blocks....

creations-chat 2020-10-28 01:11:51 > I don't hate it im just saying it would look nicer with wedges
<@!545793563703640065> honestly, id love to have more complex wedges but the simple wedges cant achieve weird shapes that titanic has, the prow for example, the 4x1 wedge is not tall enough to to get that almost straight line or some parts of the stern... mostly like... some one them cant be used or either you can use them but you'd struggle perfecting it
creations-chat 2020-10-28 01:17:01 honestly, just look at this mess
creations-chat 2020-10-28 01:21:01 ._ . ok

creations-chat 2020-10-29 04:19:53 i was trying to make it on the hall of fame, but i think i already failed
creations-chat 2020-10-29 04:22:03 ship's hull has unique shapes
creations-chat 2020-10-29 04:23:13 i wish we have a settings in game that blocky parts of ships or build could be automatically smoothed or i mean... a button to make it smooth
edit: basically like in blender, "shade smooth"
creations-chat 2020-10-29 04:25:11 have everyone tried ocean liners tho?
creations-chat 2020-10-29 04:26:53 ._ .      i mean.. the stern? have everyone tried that, ocean liner stern...
creations-chat 2020-10-29 04:28:11 > ridiculously easy hull moment

<@!685909594932773033>

creations-chat 2020-10-30 11:42:21 yes-
honestly people say making a hull with blocks is easy, honestly no, its a legit pain using it, its not enough for making weird twisted shapes, like titanic, you cant have a smooth perfect stern with blocks its basically torture
creations-chat 2020-10-30 11:44:08 idk-

creations-chat 2020-11-24 04:09:59 this is what my old Titanic looked like
i hate it so much, i really hate it
creations-chat 2020-11-24 04:11:59 heres the current version- its like before and.. after
creations-chat 2020-11-24 04:13:30 yep, rebuild and delete some stuff, its quite stressful innit
research adds to my stress. but hey, its worth it
creations-chat 2020-11-24 04:16:51 welp i need to scale, fix and recalibrate stuff, even the hull stresses me out by just adding frames, adding the whole hull is basically torture and downloading color palates are quite annoying, fixing the colors are most annoying, I cant find some good sources in Titanica encyclopedia. annnnndddd sometimes the game just lags me
creations-chat 2020-11-24 04:18:23 it took me a year, i still have school, and plus, im a newbie when i started it, you can see that on my old screenshot.
creations-chat 2020-11-24 04:20:40 you can expect me to make another project like that but it might take me less time than.. my titanic. i learned alot of stuff when making that ship like motor lock and stuff, idk i think im not making any project yet.

the-dump 2020-12-12 01:51:39 
the-dump 2020-12-12 01:56:09 Titanic is and Olympic is too separated for that thing to happened, Olympic is 15.000 miles away to titanic and can't do anything
the-dump 2020-12-12 01:56:37 Basically Titanic on that night is unlucky
the-dump 2020-12-12 01:56:47 It's far away
the-dump 2020-12-12 01:57:37 Look at the distress call map and what ships who gave their locations, they have a map of that I think
the-dump 2020-12-12 01:58:24 The Samson's and Califorian are the closest ship Titanic has encounter but they didn't help
the-dump 2020-12-12 01:58:44 No
the-dump 2020-12-12 01:59:07 I think Califorian is close and their marconi is operator is kn watch
the-dump 2020-12-12 01:59:17 They just communicated in morse lap
the-dump 2020-12-12 01:59:33 But Titanic didn't respond since they have no morse lamp
the-dump 2020-12-12 02:00:00 They just fired flares to signal closer ships
the-dump 2020-12-12 02:00:33 They send like 5 every 20 mins, idk
the-dump 2020-12-12 02:01:01 You mean the nuntucket light ship
the-dump 2020-12-12 02:01:23 It's a safety procedure in 1900
the-dump 2020-12-12 02:01:48 But the British government didn't get to allow titanic to have a ton of lifeboats
the-dump 2020-12-12 02:01:58 So men were basically stuck with in the ship
the-dump 2020-12-12 02:02:41 But even if they have a lot of lifeboats they still can't survive other survivors
the-dump 2020-12-12 02:03:29 Lifeboat drills are already done in Belfast but lighttoller didn't think the davits is powerful to handle 70 people on lifebloats
the-dump 2020-12-12 02:04:16 Ok ok why do won't the possible added lifeboats won't help the passengers?
the-dump 2020-12-12 02:04:39 They literally haven't lowered 2 collapsible when the deck is flooding
the-dump 2020-12-12 02:04:45 They just be swamped
the-dump 2020-12-12 02:04:59 They're actually are of them
the-dump 2020-12-12 02:05:16 One of them I think is lifeboat 7?
the-dump 2020-12-12 02:05:23 Idk
the-dump 2020-12-12 02:06:39 Class Britannic has a lot of lifeboats right
the-dump 2020-12-12 02:06:55 But they only have 30 casualties, think why
the-dump 2020-12-12 02:07:37 Think why a lot of crews and nurses survived
the-dump 2020-12-12 02:07:55 No
the-dump 2020-12-12 02:07:59 No
the-dump 2020-12-12 02:08:20 The lifeboat davits, those big ones, they are fast on cranking
the-dump 2020-12-12 02:08:44 It means they launched the boats pretty fast
the-dump 2020-12-12 02:09:01 No one is legit in water when she's sinking
the-dump 2020-12-12 02:09:20 Remember Britannic sank only 55 mins
the-dump 2020-12-12 02:09:36 Titanic sank 2 hours and 40 mins
the-dump 2020-12-12 02:09:47 It means they cranked the lifeboats too slow
the-dump 2020-12-12 02:10:04 Yup
the-dump 2020-12-12 02:10:27 Britannics upgrades are really good when you think of it
the-dump 2020-12-12 02:10:56 Yup
the-dump 2020-12-12 02:11:17 I Think the davits are the best upgrade on the ship
the-dump 2020-12-12 02:11:33 If Olympic we're to sink, she might have a lot of casualties
the-dump 2020-12-12 02:11:41 That's nice
the-dump 2020-12-12 02:11:51 The interior is still the same so....
the-dump 2020-12-12 02:12:02 Ik
the-dump 2020-12-12 02:13:08 Idk but I think Olympic class public toilets are quite bad
the-dump 2020-12-12 02:13:30 There's small amounts of public toilets onboard and it feels annoying

the-dump 2020-12-12 02:15:39 Olympic is yes beautiful but I can just wait for people getting put of toilets
the-dump 2020-12-12 02:16:31 Fun fact, Olympic is the only passenger or merchant ship who sank a u boat
the-dump 2020-12-12 02:17:44 It sent a reverse uno card
the-dump 2020-12-12 02:18:10 LOL
the-dump 2020-12-12 02:18:31 Fun fact Olympic class's hull is strong
