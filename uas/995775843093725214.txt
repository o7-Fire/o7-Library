creations-chat 2022-07-28 04:52:15 I did not understand
creations-chat 2022-07-28 04:54:18 What did I do wrong? I ask and what is wip I don't understand
creations-chat 2022-07-28 05:05:12 ok ðŸ™‚
creations-chat 2022-07-28 05:07:16 I speak Spanish so that's why I understood less I didn't imagine it was all abbreviated
creations-chat 2022-07-28 05:10:17 are you using translator like me? I didn't pronounce well
creations-chat 2022-07-28 05:12:20 so from what I see this is a server where let's say only expert builders get more rating I'm seeing a lot of decent builds have more down arrow
creations-chat 2022-07-28 05:16:42 but in my opinion the requirements to be well qualified are a bit high taking into account what you see on a normal server compared to what you did you already feel great you come here and quite the opposite

creations-chat 2022-07-28 05:27:45 Thanks for your opinion. I don't plan on doing the wings again, but I'll take that into account. According to another person, the air intakes were quite small and the cabin should be larger, although I imagine that plane with those characteristics would affect its performance.
creations-chat 2022-07-28 05:30:04 a su 27 below with afterburner there you can see its missiles and its lights on
creations-chat 2022-07-28 05:32:46 ok
creations-chat 2022-07-28 05:58:17 is toxicity necessary? or the insults as if I were insulting creations 
I don't care much about the edition, I edited it in windows
creations-chat 2022-07-28 06:00:28 can you show me your creations to see by dm? to see if you are so expert
creations-chat 2022-07-28 06:02:31 then why do you direct insults towards the creations? you do them so well? speak by dm not here
creations-chat 2022-07-28 06:22:31 produced by lockheed
creations-chat 2022-07-28 06:27:23 correct it is designed by general dynamics something that I did not say but I did remember it while writing that
creations-chat 2022-07-28 06:31:41 I did not build that, I just said that if it put lockheed martin maybe it was because general dynamics sold its company to lockheed martin and now it is produced by lockheed for export (sold his production company)
creations-chat 2022-07-28 06:35:00 you can exceed 600 speed I have never achieved it in airplanes no matter how many engines they have they cannot reach 1000 I mean match 1
creations-chat 2022-07-28 06:37:21 I did not say that he had built the plane I only said that not that he had built the plane but I see although I should not make fun of him although I think that if he was going to put something there he would have created something
creations-chat 2022-07-28 06:39:27 a guy used this comparison to say that my aircraft is shit it's not the best but I don't see the need for insults
creations-chat 2022-08-01 19:35:23 Will I leave them or will I make changes? ðŸ¤”
creations-chat 2022-08-01 19:37:37 I know that I decide but what do you think I would love your opinions
