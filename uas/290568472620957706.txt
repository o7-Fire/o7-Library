creations-chat 2019-02-18 21:22:47 u should use a 1x2 for the part of the tail that touches the plane
creations-chat 2019-02-18 21:23:15 or a half wedge(in the wedges section) and a 1x2 half wedge
creations-chat 2019-02-18 21:23:20 could also work and u should put a half block at the top of the tail to make it look like the tail wings arent at the exact top
bug-reports 2019-03-11 02:04:05 after rejoining the game a few times the color saving glitch stopped happening so if u have it just color 1 thing and rejoin to see if its fixed but it still doesn't completely fix it since you have to save and rejoin every time you color something
