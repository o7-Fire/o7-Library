The Tale of captain_atk2052 (794103947619074048)
creations-chat 2022-08-21 05:02:19 Bro people hating on good builds..
creations-chat 2022-08-21 05:11:16 Literally most <#384025409945337856> . Like the majority of people literally classify a good creation a disastrous mess just because of 3 imperfections. Bro this is literally the reason why I hate big as social media platforms. You get hate for trying.

I know it’s a damn paragraph but who cares I’m stating facts
