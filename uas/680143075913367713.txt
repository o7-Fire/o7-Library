creations-chat 2022-07-07 01:35:12 i used angle locking for the tracks, so you are incorrect. and i care about 1% about having skill in plane crazy i just build stuff when i feel like it. i mostly develop shit anyways so i care less about what it looks like
creations-chat 2022-07-07 01:44:29 ok to answer both of your questions: 1. i dont care if i made the tracks wrong. 2. i already changed the wheels, plus i answered that question a long while back 3. the sketchfab model i used has mirrors on it
creations-chat 2022-07-07 01:46:40 i could fucking care less, i literally said i care 1% about having skill in plane crazy, i play it once every 2 months at best, i dont spend all my time on a game where i have a poor selection of blocks and design mechanics
