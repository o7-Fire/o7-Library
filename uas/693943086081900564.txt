creations-chat 2022-04-15 03:01:44 the secondary part of the canopy is longer than one block and quite a bit shorter than 2. i cant fix the gap. i dont see a solution to the wheels and wings/flaps.
creations-chat 2022-04-15 03:05:30 if its the cockpit gap then theres no hope, it still has a gap in between when i do that.
creations-chat 2022-04-15 03:07:13 Dude its not like that, it still has a gap I’ve tried it all.
