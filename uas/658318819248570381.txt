creations-chat 2020-11-19 15:41:18 yeah and tbh tutorials are just a cheap way of getting free builds, that doesnt help people, it takes the aspect of learning in the game and crap and then tutorial channels **(some of them like thrizet that are actually good ones that help people arent included in this)** just spam tutorials for the clout then just leave youtube, while they are still making money from little brain dead 1 year olds joining and not learning anything
creations-chat 2020-11-19 15:43:22 people like floaty just spam for the clout, tank fish helps

<@!489910972946055172> ill try to do that, it would mess with the angle though, ill try

creations-chat 2020-11-20 13:48:50 <@!537390843649196069>  for the honda repsol you need to add more curves if possible, motorlock those fireworks in so it doesnt stick out that much, besides that it looks pretty poggers <:PewPew:532303441293344778>
creations-chat 2020-11-20 13:53:38 They are just referencing the picture, it doesn't say in the rules that it is illegal to put the picture you referenced on. Also when you say crap about ranks it don't matter it is legit just a rank don't get so salty. "So you are in no position to speak either" crap.
creations-chat 2020-11-20 13:55:23 Oh, when I was reading rules I didn't see that, sorry!
creations-chat 2020-11-20 13:57:36 Well I feel like if he didn't post the reference picture the thing would get way more downvotes, because no one would have anything to compare to.
creations-chat 2020-11-20 13:59:06 Yeah, but some upvotes is better than none, lmao.
creations-chat 2020-11-20 14:01:27 Should I make an F-18 Super Hornet, or a regular Hornet? I'm kind of leaning towards Super Hornet, because the curve on the front of the wing for the Super Hornet is much easier.
creations-chat 2020-11-20 14:02:58 Do you have any Intake design for the Super Hornet? I've been toying around with it lately and it all just turns out oversized. <:thconking:535171057649188865> <:Trigje139:559518788660232196> I'll give a picture of my scale in a second!

creations-chat 2020-12-29 02:01:07 the canopy and nose look to short, i would do a custom angle for the spine, it looks to short for how wide it is tbh
creations-chat 2020-12-29 18:17:49 obc i would fix the nose and the spine of the aircraft, it looks a little blocky tbh
creations-chat 2020-12-29 18:20:07 just do a custom angle

creations-chat 2021-02-11 17:22:36 femboy one, downvote time
creations-chat 2021-02-11 18:10:13 How is it short, it looks pretty accurate. Maybe because the tower isn't on, or the fact that the thing is the largiest carrier in plane crazy and is so compact with the folding that he could get one or 2 blocks long enough.
creations-chat 2021-02-11 18:14:57 How?
creations-chat 2021-02-11 18:22:49 The reason why it is like that is because look on how small he made the angle right here compared to the blueprint. You cannot really fix that when you get that far

creations-chat 2021-02-11 20:20:18 That isn't the same, you can obviously see the Mig on the carrier which is 3 blocks wide in the fuselage, so you can use that for scale. (also there is no altitude meter)

creations-chat 2021-02-26 18:30:06 The build looks pretty well, but I suggest going smaller instead of that gigantic size. I think you could get more upvotes with a smaller build with the same amount of detail as a big build. It looks very eh, the nose looks very long and the canopy looks very un-aerodynamic, but it is still pretty cool.

creations-chat 2021-07-22 18:33:48 yeah it is really easy, there might be a spot open in the motorlock where they can fit a motor justt simply angling with the canopy, ive seen smaller scales with it, then there is camera lock you can also do <:trollsex:849067730093998110>

creations-chat 2021-08-06 22:13:51 <@469318402087845898> your k2 is nice in detail but I think the camo is bland and the if that thing is for detail because I doubt it is for your little rok group (mainly cuz most pc groups are for pvp) I think you could’ve made tracks
creations-chat 2021-08-06 22:18:15 I think that the camo would look better with the desert camo below, also what do you think about making treds?

creations-chat 2021-08-16 06:22:56 Dude I literally said he mustve just over angled it since in the video it says they were in a time crunch,
creations-chat 2021-08-16 06:26:32 Honestly my critiques on thrizets f 14 is that having the fuselage/ nose be 2 blocks is a block thin, the intakes kinda ass and most of all look at how small his elevators are (also no tail angle <:cyberbully:853345639270055956> )
creations-chat 2021-08-16 06:32:16 I can put my f 14s nose over a blueprint and it would be like a pixel to fat (it is 3 block)
creations-chat 2021-08-16 06:34:31 Facts, I prefer a block and a half

it is stupid how people cry about lack in detail when it says wip <:trollface:775024642104229898>

creations-chat 2021-10-02 20:56:32 it is all fun and games until you bring that to a public pvp server 💀
creations-chat 2021-10-02 20:58:39 BUDDY. please restart, you dont start with the tail as the nose is what dictates the skill level of the aircraft before you get too far 
- the cockpit glass is too tiny for the scale
- ive brought this up before but the thing doesnt curve like an airliner
- the 1x2 for the nose angle into the cockpit is way too steep, but nothing you can fix since the whole thing is practically inaccurate
- how many blocks?

this one
creations-chat 2021-10-31 13:55:48 here is the thing 
that video i posted is mine
and i wasnt in pcc at that time
<:skull10:891491696905429043>
although the parts of the plane i think are copied couldve been copied by a old friend of mine which he let me copy of off
creations-chat 2021-10-31 13:58:09 well then in this case i guess the old friend i copied off of was copying you?
cuz im pretty sure he was in pcc at that time
his roblox name is like Cursed_Concord or something it is the the desc of the video
creations-chat 2021-10-31 14:01:13 i think so cuz when copying it i think i had to eat dinner or soemthing 


let me check my files
creations-chat 2021-10-31 14:04:35 i dont <:Cry:884995676650471474>
creations-chat 2021-10-31 14:06:38 ye that was the part i copied from my friend including the rudder which seems similar aswell
creations-chat 2021-11-06 19:10:46 <@456226577798135808> damn bro your profile picture must represent your humor (it is old) because that meme is so old and dead I DIED of laughter <a:urnotfunny:848931822879899689>
creations-chat 2021-11-06 19:16:41 yeah sort of
creations-chat 2021-11-10 00:02:45 <@!294980570885390346> best f-14 in creations ive seen in a while with the Spades livery but the nose looks long (if it is the angle i get it) 
but also what is going on with the wing fold, it should be smooth and not have such an odd look (could also be the angle but if true can we get a birds eye view?)
creations-chat 2021-11-10 00:09:06 yeah just leave it i guess but if you want, hopefully this doesnt take 5 months, you can just get rid of the half wedge and move it up a half block but if you cant i totally understand


also ignore the bozos saying to delete it (they have plane crazy tank profile pictures 🤡 <:funny:812222096985554976> )

creations-chat 2021-11-18 04:21:01 So from ths info I gain you are a tutorial copier, since that SBD is my plane that my friend made a tutorial on, you also have a reapers spitfire in your profile picture so I assume you are gay. Also good job on the modifications but didnt really work out did it?

What you copied.

<@!386958950123175947> dude look at the tail, rudder, canopy, even the way the bombs are placed are the same, the fuselage he updated, the wings which he updated, and the color (different).
creations-chat 2021-11-18 04:29:19 i meant as in the color was changed, but the tail is similar, you can see the way he positioned the 1x4 wedges that were moved back a block, to conceal the landing gear, which he has also updated, but originally was used as a way to hide the landing gear
creations-chat 2021-11-18 04:35:01 basically i moved the 1x4 to hide the gear which he did, possibly meaning he originally had it like the tutorial but later changed it. 
even the holes where the gear fold up are the same 💀 anyways goodnight'

creations-chat 2022-11-17 00:33:46 soccer

and you say that aint a good sport it is the same damn thing as ice hockey
creations-chat 2022-11-17 00:38:53 mf hockey is the canadian version 

see soccer you can do things like not slip on your ass and punt it accross a field that is OUTSIDE and hot. 
I go on all my socials when im out for like a split second unless i have to talk to weirdos like you <:trollface:775024642104229898>
creations-chat 2022-11-17 00:43:09 soccer is #faster, you go outside (i see why you play hockey cuz you are scared of the outside) 

i dont play professional soccer where cards like that exist, hockey is the exact same thing except with a stick and more armor.
creations-chat 2022-11-17 00:50:20 thank you <@456226577798135808> 

cards are why players fake the injuries (if youu did an ouunce of research you would know)
the outside joke was well, a joke 

leme list the similarites

Soccer: run to the opposite side and get a goal, hope the goalie doesnt block it 
Hockey: skate to the other side with a stick and hit it in, smaller goal so less chance it goes in but youuu still pray it goes in. 

name things that are different pls
creations-chat 2022-11-17 00:52:55 when did I say yall "copied" soccer? 
im simply stating the similarities since appently being on ice makes it more fun.

i do agree it is boring to watch but playing is 100% more fun
creations-chat 2022-11-17 00:55:31 bud i was saying if yo hockey playin ass were to comment about the play style that it would be hypocritical of you to do so ❤️
creations-chat 2022-11-17 00:57:34 ight im tired of fighting im tryna do some other shit

creations-chat 2023-04-17 11:38:35 usually 6 out of the 8 servers (avg for flightpoint) usually have 8-10 players in them, I just checked and it says that abt 30 people are on flightpoint when most of the player base in EST time are in school <:stuff:908917207986208828>
creations-chat 2023-04-17 11:41:40 also <@1069215498925002842> what about plane crazy servers? they are probably the laggiest it has ever been, half of my friends with some of the most powerful computers I have seen can barely spawn their planes anymore. It really is ashame because both games have their ups and downs but it looks like pc is falling off hard because of a mid developer
creations-chat 2023-04-17 11:43:59 would you rather have an equally bad dev that updates sometimes or an equally bad dev who is just dead, and doesn’t care enough to polish the game some more so that servers don’t make it impossible to spawn your builds
creations-chat 2023-04-17 11:50:17 it really isn’t, in place crazy that Motorlock is needed to make like 2 angles when in flightpoint you can get virtually any angle now with the snap to grid on/off update, you probably haven’t even tried the game because I remember I disliked flightpoint for quite some time until I actually got invested into a build. Try the game before you shit on it
creations-chat 2023-04-17 11:52:18 if you want to back this statement please send pictures, and when you played the game while making them because if you are complaining of bugs and such they have probably already been patched since cheese is actually updating the game unlike Rickje <:stuff:908917207986208828>
creations-chat 2023-04-17 11:57:14 they can barely spawn in, my friend had a gripen he was working on and now is physically incapable of spawning in without having to wait 2-3 minutes  <@448677698773057547> thise looks pretty good, about 7 updates have happened since the last time you played <:FineTroll:626841259746656289>
creations-chat 2023-04-17 12:01:50 he is working on a new map, and the “chore” of building is a lot better than a lag bomb riding at about 100sps at 3fps and have you tried to make anything besides a car?

creations-chat 2023-05-15 04:14:10 this shitty server dead as hell, there ain’t no good builds to look at anymore. Whitenames have taken control as most of the skilled community had moved to FP
creations-chat 2023-05-15 04:16:52 nah FP just Better lmao although it takes a bit more skill which is fine because there are no shitty players
creations-chat 2023-05-15 20:10:58 bro your tomcat is straight cheeks I don’t want to hear it

<@448677698773057547> tomcat prob the best, accurate width (3 wide) and most proportionally correct, it just lacks a bit of emojis
creations-chat 2023-05-15 20:13:46 ALSO not to mention id rather have no cockpit than whatever this is, your bottom is the only mid part but even then the change from blocky to circular underneath the intakes is disgusting

btw your intakes are wayyy to tall lmaohttps://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/384025409945337856/1106643670565916793/FrontSeat.PNG

creations-chat 2023-05-24 20:23:55 u just mad cuz u gotta go through the beginner stage of a building game again 💀 not to mention it takes almost 2 times longer to make a build in FP than Pc cuz u can get better detail, proportions, and style
creations-chat 2023-05-24 20:31:00 dude it was boring because you were playing it right on release, it got hella updates since then (whitelisting is a thing)
creations-chat 2023-05-24 20:33:09 so the only time you tried to REALLY play the game was when it first dropped? you made joke builds rather than really trying so of course it goin to be boring 🤣
creations-chat 2023-06-03 16:35:42 wtf is that
creations-chat 2023-06-03 16:41:13 wtf is you
creations-chat 2023-06-03 16:44:01 bro staying in pcc 😂 only shit you’ll see is horrid whitename builds 🙏❤️

creations-chat 2023-06-22 15:10:31 <@1114967477244411964> please jump off a cliff 🙏
creations-chat 2023-06-22 15:27:08 🤓
creations-chat 2023-06-22 15:29:30 🤓
creations-chat 2023-06-24 18:21:06 The coping <:shock:1098116005252841503>
creations-chat 2023-06-29 18:08:13 FP only has limits by the dev cuz he can’t model flight correctly, or torque, or pvp, but the building system is id say on par with builds from your game 💯
creations-chat 2023-06-29 18:11:39 even then you don’t need half of that stuff to create great looking things, there are many different games for people who wanna be simplistic in building, or complex, or just wanna have fun, please stop coming at us for having a building system that just got recognized (FP) or an older game (PC), just mind your own business man
creations-chat 2023-06-29 18:15:04 <@1016509044468486255> there really is no point to this, people enjoy whga they wanna enjoy, sometimes it isn’t always about what others think or how realistic it is, it is just about what you find to be good and fun (also you seem to be the hostile one as you are calling a OLD building system ass, rather than just being normal and calling it simple) there is a reason why your game is never talked about, because it is too complex or just unfun.
creations-chat 2023-06-29 18:19:41 then just stop talking, I don’t see anybody here asking for a new game or wanting to move on from plane crazy, now me I moved to FP cuz it is fun for me, and that is ok. There is no need for this bickering any longer as it is brain rotting
creations-chat 2023-06-29 18:21:53 (I though that b52 he posted was from Flightpoint to be honest <:shock:1098116005252841503> )
creations-chat 2023-06-29 18:25:33 Bro please just be quiet nobody cares about elite engineers, like I said before this is not a case of a game being underrated, it is a case of a shitty community (such as yourself) and players not finding it fun, nobody here is asking for an alternative to plane crazy or flightpoint.
creations-chat 2023-06-29 18:29:11 You go on, stop promoting on the game you find fun. Go to the EE discord and have fun there, you are yelling into a void as your opinion is not being taken seriously. EE could be good for sure but I’m sticking to FP/PC cuz there is reasons as to why people are staying. “I will continue spreading the word” nobody gives a fuck dude. You are not the messiah you are a random person on discord talking about a silly roblox building game in other silly roblox building game servers.
creations-chat 2023-06-29 18:32:22 See that’s where you just fucked up,  “I want realistic shit” you just told us that you are only spreading the word cuz you hate the builds here, which you can easy not look at by LEAVING THE SERVER. You are a troglodyte and from what I can tell nobody is going with you to Elite Extra chromosomes.
creations-chat 2023-06-29 18:34:46 I will say this one more time, you have gained no positive outcome from this experience, nobody is going with you to Elite Engineers.
creations-chat 2023-06-29 18:37:04 Who in here is this “specific player”? Because from what I can tell you have only gotten negative feedback on Elite Extra Chromosomes
creations-chat 2023-06-29 18:39:06 Just leave. <@866848584888877077> do your job, he is self promoting
creations-chat 2023-06-30 13:13:24 wtf is that nose it looks like an F15
creations-chat 2023-06-30 16:47:46 that thing ajnt@too decent either chief
creations-chat 2023-06-30 20:15:49 no but he is right that thing doesn’t not@look like an F22

creations-chat 2023-07-15 15:03:03 You would not have that freedom of speech without the American flag you are burning.
creations-chat 2023-07-15 16:17:15 Honestly I don’t understand why mfs be burning American flags when people have died in honor for it. The same mfs have the audacity to complain at people downvoting and disliking it, when their stupid LGBTQ flag doesn’t represent shit besides p*dophilia and other insane activity’s such as supporting “fatphobia”. Apparently everyone needs a safe space now when before it used to be “step out side of your bubble”. I’d rather be considered an edgy 14 year old military fanatic than a LGBTQ blue hair 200lbs 5’3 girl who just so happens is a dude with self diagnosed ADHD, Bipolar disorder, and depression. <:shock:1098116005252841503> <:shock:1098116005252841503> ( <@521504905693888521> <@723204794671562882> )

creations-chat 2023-07-15 17:33:19 who are you
creations-chat 2023-07-15 17:39:22 i beg to differ.
