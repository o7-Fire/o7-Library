bug-reports 2021-03-19 20:12:06 Ok , so here's the explanation , I don't know why this bug appears , i just spawned and another person spawned in this plot too (i didn't take a screenshot), then that person left and now my plot appears with the name of "no one".
Probably isn't a big deal of a bug but i post it anyway (just in case).
Steps to reproduce it:
Maybe that one person and you appear at the same time? I don't really know.
