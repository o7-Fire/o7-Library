creations-chat 2021-05-25 15:03:54 herman the german sherman
creations-chat 2021-05-25 15:19:31 looks like a panther a to me
bot-central 2021-05-25 16:02:34 !rank
creations-chat 2021-05-25 22:22:48 <@!290528894057185280> looks kinda flat, not enough wheels, turret too far forward (probably because the front plate isnt angled enough)
creations-chat 2021-05-25 22:31:26 thats why i do the wheels first
||and then end up making the tank oversized||

bot-central 2021-05-26 03:08:41 *cries*
creations-chat 2021-05-26 12:54:26 *pretty sure you should put that in*<#478584971670454284>
creations-chat 2021-05-26 13:09:44 "you got a hole in your left wing"
creations-chat 2021-05-26 13:14:23 well i mean it does say that they wont give you a rank if the creation is low effort
creations-chat 2021-05-26 16:46:13 <@456226577798135808> the nose looks messy and is too short, the cockpit is too small and probably shouldnt be sticking above the rest of the plane
creations-chat 2021-05-26 16:48:15 actually nevermind the nose might not be too short
probably just looks short because of the front is kinda oversized
bot-central 2021-05-26 17:08:03 !rank
creations-chat 2021-05-26 22:16:32 <@!324733815161487371> tank is pogger but i feel like the barrel should be a bit longer
maybe its just the camera angle
creations-chat 2021-05-27 15:01:14 j
creations-chat 2021-05-27 15:03:40 *if only i could motorlock like that*
my cockpit just uses wedges

creations-chat 2021-06-02 01:41:52 <@!627813759427018752> that t126 is too flat
the turret is too large (and doesnt appear to be able to turn)
the wheels are angled and also too small
and you dont even have the right amount of wheels
creations-chat 2021-06-02 18:10:35 <@456226577798135808> that kv2 is way too long and the turret isnt large enough
creations-chat 2021-10-09 19:30:06 i mean it looks really flat on the outside
creations-chat 2021-10-09 19:34:02 ~~well why didnt you show the inside then~~
nevermind im actually blind
creations-chat 2021-10-09 19:37:35 big and kinda boring honestly
everything is default material and mostly normal blocks
creations-chat 2021-10-09 19:41:52 <@!609921899585077296> add small details
creations-chat 2021-10-09 19:46:31 <@!609921899585077296> doom turtle looks a bit tall
creations-chat 2021-10-16 04:32:15 yes??????
creations-chat 2021-10-26 14:35:37 it's an edited tutorial
creations-chat 2021-10-26 15:06:49 looks really weird
creations-chat 2021-10-28 15:51:55 it's not even your build why does it matter
creations-chat 2021-10-29 18:22:48 floating tank track of death
creations-chat 2021-10-29 18:39:31 honestly you shouldn't really care too much about how well it works if it's just that impractical
creations-chat 2021-10-29 18:43:14 Assuming it works like a normal tank track you could just use track tensioning to fix the issue of it just falling off
creations-chat 2021-11-01 15:48:45 because not having motorlock usually makes a build look super basic
creations-chat 2021-11-04 12:39:24 <@626340170609983488> it's way too simple make it larger
help 2021-11-10 13:47:46 Make a new plane
help 2021-11-10 13:48:02 Can't really do much with something that small
help 2021-11-10 13:48:25 Making a larger plane would hide the motor lock
help 2021-11-10 13:48:43 Or whatever that is
help 2021-11-10 13:48:49 At the back
creations-chat 2021-11-10 19:41:00 <@750712383227428945> both look shit :troll: 
Wings look weird on both and the tail is too tall
Also landing gear kinda small
creations-chat 2021-11-11 19:29:14 where suspension
creations-chat 2021-11-19 17:05:06 metal has a different texture and it's shinier
creations-chat 2021-11-21 00:21:10 its a box though
creations-chat 2021-11-21 00:24:28 make the front not flat and make this thing not look weird
||and maybe funnels||
creations-chat 2021-11-22 14:19:27 Because it's too easy
creations-chat 2021-11-22 18:04:09 I think you need to restart
The proportions are way off and the only part that looks like a Churchill is maybe the front plate
creations-chat 2021-11-22 18:32:00 Yeah the barrel is way too long, the tracks don't look good, the whole thing actually looks too long, and the turret is horrendous
creations-chat 2021-11-23 16:33:50 <@456226577798135808> rims too big but other than that it looks pretty decent
creations-chat 2021-11-23 16:35:57 <@456226577798135808> could use text so it doesn't poke out
help 2021-11-25 15:23:22 <@393527373729103888> could use rope and suspension?
help 2021-11-25 15:43:59 add ballast blocks to the front?
creations-chat 2021-11-26 13:36:07 Didn't he already finish that
creations-chat 2021-11-29 19:06:37 <@633731194093174795> no detail no gun looks basic
creations-chat 2021-11-29 19:09:51 get used to it it's the pcc server
creations-chat 2021-11-29 19:16:14 why are you making such a big deal out of people telling you it looks shit
creations-chat 2021-11-29 19:21:23 <@633731194093174795> motor lock the gun one block down, add storage bins, add a drivers hatch or vision slit, make the turret less flat and less triangular, maybe add a machine gun, find a better colour that isn't so bright, maybe use metal for the material
creations-chat 2021-11-29 19:32:07 <@633731194093174795> saying fuck everyone is only going to make the problem worse just ignore the not helpful stuff
creations-chat 2021-11-29 19:49:05 <@633731194093174795> btw youre missing a gun mantlet
creations-chat 2021-11-30 18:39:49 <@691987277072695387> it has no protection, literally just a skeleton, no detail, mines would be pretty much useless, and one hit anywhere with a missile would probably cripple it
also lack of firepower
creations-chat 2021-11-30 18:41:50 also it looks a little unnecessarily complicated what are all those motors for
`wait were you trying to make torsion bar suspension`
help 2021-12-02 14:38:00 Motor + cameras + the part that needs to be angled
help 2021-12-02 14:38:34 no
help 2021-12-02 14:38:44 I'm in school lol
help 2021-12-02 14:39:25 It shouldn't be that complicated unless you don't know how motor lock works
creations-chat 2021-12-18 04:40:06 *maybe its because you have two motors on each elevator*
help 2021-12-18 04:45:26 should consider using blueprint things or a 3d model
help 2021-12-18 04:51:53 yeah three days sounds about right
help 2022-01-24 14:03:22 Ballast blocks
creations-chat 2022-02-28 16:58:47 doubt
creations-chat 2022-02-28 17:01:29 you can't just get a rank by making a low quality plane in 5 minutes and then begging for the role
creations-chat 2022-02-28 17:04:23 accept the fact that your plane is terrible and next time actually put some effort into your build
help 2022-03-09 15:51:37 It might be because you have 2 servos connected to each other
help 2022-03-09 15:54:28 oh
help 2022-04-20 18:16:23 lock the piston?
