bot-central 2021-03-13 23:32:26 &suggest ball summoner
[gameplay] [configurable]
a block that summons balls infront of it and u can choose how many it summons and how fast and what button to trigger it for example place 100 balls summon 1 ball every 0.5 second or 10 balls every 5 seconds Q to trigger it I have suggested this cause I like to make stuff that shoots balls like a gun rapidly into grass not to annoy people and not for lag just for fun and it takes forever to place them all down and build a wall around them so they don’t fall out
