creations-chat 2021-01-31 03:35:42 thoughts on my stratosfortress? mainly on the nose i want to get better at smooth noses on planes
creations-chat 2021-01-31 03:38:36 i agree on the nose and i want to know what you mean with the wings because i put most of the work in the wings considering the stratosfortress has very intresting wings it does have landing gear you just cant see them they are the tiny ones and by short do you mean length? because the width is pretty small on the real plane
