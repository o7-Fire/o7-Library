help 2023-06-13 04:38:11 good news
it worked
bad news
after I moved the jet engines to the back (ijad moved to front for testing), i discovered the center of mass is slightly more to the right
I spent most of the time I didn't talk here searching for the object that's causing that, but i didnt find anything
help 2023-06-13 05:19:57 it seems the problem with the center of mass was some parachutes at the center of the plane
help 2023-06-13 05:20:13 but i not sure
but the plane finally flies normally now! thx :)
