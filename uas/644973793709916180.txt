creations-chat 2022-01-01 14:21:09 not all of them most of them just get lights and sirens put on them as painting them would be too expensive
creations-chat 2022-01-01 14:24:23 never said you are American im saying ur too dumb to understand how American police work also they will only get repainted if there is a unsuitable camo on the truck in which case it'll not be donated
