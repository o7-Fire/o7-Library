creations-chat 2020-08-18 10:48:40 > i can just aim a rocket at your frontal turret, and your gun barrel wouldn't be on the tank anymore
<@!332227374278246401> yes but its fast it can dodge rockets someimes
creations-chat 2020-08-18 10:48:59 > rockets should be scattered around the turret like this

creations-chat 2020-08-18 10:50:47 > and make the gun barrel perhaps out of explosive blocks, keybinded to a key you woudln't press
> The reason is that it can't be penetrated by shredders, and guns don't do anything to an explosive block
