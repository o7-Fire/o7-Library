creations-chat 2021-01-31 22:44:44 intake doesnt look finished
creations-chat 2021-01-31 22:56:50 it looks good, only thing i would mention is the intake, but i think your still working in that area, right?
creations-chat 2021-01-31 23:02:20 no, its from the more recent show, called Enterprise lol
creations-chat 2021-01-31 23:16:22 no, the show is called Enterprise. It basically the story of the first ever warp 5 human starship. its the Enterprise NX 01
creations-chat 2021-02-01 15:05:07 There are a lot of people with high taste, as well as a lot of salty people that downvote bc their build got downvoted
creations-chat 2021-02-01 15:08:53 Yeah, a lot of the voters are not fair
creations-chat 2021-02-01 15:12:24 Thats a pretty standard engine, and I can see people can make some pretty dirty stuff with that
creations-chat 2021-02-02 03:17:01 show us it in build mode, on flight mode looks like a thrown together pvp thing. prove to us it took an hour. bc that doesnt look like it
creations-chat 2021-02-02 03:52:14 100 dollars to each of us?
creations-chat 2021-02-04 22:43:20 ik
creations-chat 2021-02-04 22:45:23 My goal was to make a big version of it, since I already had a small version of it, and I wanted to have it as practice for more motor locked things. Yeah the front looks a little weird, had to fit the 3 blades motors in.
creations-chat 2021-02-04 22:48:41 Ok savllen, and wdym D1n0. I wanted to make them thicker than 1 wing panel. responding here bc slow chat is so dumb. I see what you mean, ill add some shape to them
creations-chat 2021-02-04 22:53:37 lol are you out of space for more? Instead of waiting you can just edit the msg
creations-chat 2021-02-04 22:56:21 is there a certain jet its made after, or custom?
creations-chat 2021-02-04 23:11:25 Fonnex, how many blocks is that? Can we see it in build mode? With slow chat just edit your new msg into the old one. Otherwise you need to wait for 2 minutes.

creations-chat 2021-02-04 23:28:53 I did my best to with motor lock, but to make the 3 blades I needed the gap. Ive gotten suggestions to make the cockpit better, and I will. I did my best to minimize that gap

creations-chat 2021-03-22 16:23:48 <@!719168864705052802> ik your just showing off with that iron cross to the other guy, but show me that in build mode. I think hes trying to find a good compact way to make it, and yours appears to have more motorlocking
creations-chat 2021-03-22 16:25:51 Yes, but motor lock takes space. Which you might not have if your build is big
creations-chat 2021-03-22 16:48:28 Which takes up even more space, leaving less space for the motorlocked parts of the iron cross
creations-chat 2021-03-22 20:05:47 Good to know, now i know that its not that big
creations-chat 2021-03-23 13:37:47 <@456226577798135808> you gonna get a warning for that image. Its a low effort build, and a reference picture

creations-chat 2021-03-23 14:12:18 yep
creations-chat 2021-03-25 14:48:50 The separator in the cockpit is very thicc. Maybe try motorlocking in a wing panel, as it is much skinnier than a full block

bug-reports 2021-03-31 23:51:05 Yeah hes posted it in creations feedback already, and somewhere else
creations-chat 2021-04-01 02:03:45 <@!642524491439800330> did you add retractable landing gear to your stuka by any chance?
creations-chat 2021-04-01 02:06:23 Because uh, hate to break it to ya, but stukas had fixed landing gear. They dont retract inwards, and they stay fully out.
creations-chat 2021-04-01 02:32:28 Its alr, I can see how they may look like that. At least its a pretty easy fix for you, if you wanted you could just remove the motor and youd be set
creations-chat 2021-04-01 02:34:30 You can post anything from any game or irl as long as its sfw, and isnt low effort or someone elses build

creations-chat 2021-08-19 15:42:47 <@!876546322885386250> why did you post a tutorial build, you can tell by the nose
creations-chat 2021-08-19 15:59:57 <@!691238351767863357> Most often the cannons on the stuka were located on the fixed gear legs, or close by them.
creations-chat 2021-08-19 16:05:29 then why add the airbrakes <:empty:794431705070174238>
creations-chat 2021-08-19 16:07:41 you see, thats realism. theres no effect like that in plane crazy
creations-chat 2021-08-19 16:11:15 so your saying your going for realism but at the same time your not
creations-chat 2021-08-19 16:13:45 <:empty:794431705070174238>  i am done dealing with this shit

creations-chat 2021-08-21 20:39:37 <@!777362709569994752> I like your red baron, but the top wing is missing a detailed part. the control just out a bit from the main wing
