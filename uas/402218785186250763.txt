help 2022-08-25 13:02:43 even when I find a good symbol that ROBLOX actually recognises, the filter system hashes it out

creations-chat 2022-08-25 23:38:07 I dunno if the use of legacy glass works well enough with this, but I have interior controls. Any suggestions?
creations-chat 2022-08-25 23:41:27 aight cheers for the feedback. Im just gonna use normal glass for da now
creations-chat 2022-08-26 00:12:54 how badly do people criticise exposed locks?
help 2022-08-26 17:59:29 Would anyone know reasons to why my f18 likes to turn left when on the ground only? It stops going left once im in the air.

help 2022-08-26 18:04:59 I dunno why u cant just throw that into the fuselage
help 2022-08-26 18:05:19 The whole wing is moving????????
help 2022-08-26 18:05:46 yh why u motor locking that?
help 2022-08-26 18:06:19 just hide more wing panels into the fuselage using the main motor lock
help 2022-08-26 18:07:06 **make more**
help 2022-08-26 18:08:31 can I ask what jet r u building? a euro fighter?
help 2022-08-26 18:08:50 ah
creations-chat 2022-08-26 19:31:20 wdym with the engines?
And ik it hasnt got the streamline, the only size that would work would be to use text shapes that constantly get filtered out cuz Roblox text filter system sucks ass
creations-chat 2022-08-26 19:38:04 Yh thats the plan, Im also gonna see if I can fit a throttle lever
creations-chat 2022-08-26 19:40:06 yh, it would require a lot more motor locking, but It would definitely be a sick feature to add
creations-chat 2022-08-26 19:43:34 I see this now. The model I have been referencing to on sketchfab made it seem more seperated

Comparing my old one to my updated version, is it any better?
help 2022-08-27 17:23:26 Anyone got a copy paste of like a filled line / rectangle that doesnt get filtered by ROBLOX?
help 2022-08-27 17:35:59 Roblox recognises them, but the filter stops them no matter what
help 2022-08-27 17:40:21 Yh Ive seen this vid, they are helpful for bypassing the filter, but it doesnt work on any of the square/rectangle text stickers that roblox recognises. Im tryna make the streamline for the topgun f18, but I think something like the base of control surfaces might have to do.
creations-chat 2022-08-27 17:44:06 https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/384025409945337856/1013133194238906468 The model is very well designed, and overall is pretty good, but the one thing u need to do is work on the tail. The motors are a bit of a mess
help 2022-08-27 18:43:45 trails would be too thin for the streamline, considering its roscale

help 2022-08-28 15:26:02 Is this topgun f18 stream line any good?
help 2022-08-28 15:33:05 yh, that wont be too difficult, but the front is a pain in the ass
help 2022-08-28 16:23:43 This is bad. What block should I use for this?
help 2022-08-28 16:24:42 as in what block should I use for the streamline?
help 2022-08-28 16:25:09 cuz trails are too thin
help 2022-08-28 16:25:30 but signs are too **T H I C C**
help 2022-08-28 16:31:15 yh but they are wings, so they will stick out, and make them look bad
help 2022-08-28 16:31:36 I want to be able to use text symbols, but roblox just filters everything out
help 2022-08-28 16:32:54 Yh thats not a bad shout. The only slight issue would be the small spacing between each sign
help 2022-08-28 17:13:12 Im no expert, but maybe place wings, some blocks and a propeller?

help 2022-09-23 09:41:56 yh but the rotation of the motor2s dont allow signs to connect the ailerons, and there are flaps in between

bug-reports 2022-10-09 13:40:29 Yh latest Roblox updates will cause outdated games that aren't updated to lag. Plane crazy is majorly hardcoded and isn't updated, running on old code, unless Roblox does something, I doubt these new lag spikes will be fixed until ***if*** pc2 comes soon
bug-reports 2022-10-10 01:06:45 you need to paint the behind, or hold down the mouse then hover over the text box
