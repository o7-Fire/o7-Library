creations-chat 2022-07-05 19:02:09 guys i made a b26 marauder and it looks good but it has the control surface glitch and the controls are inverted. It only fixes whenever i delete the pilot seat and place it back after every single load and itâ€™s so annoying.

creations-chat 2022-07-05 19:21:18 forget the motors the flames bro
bug-reports 2022-07-05 20:31:11 control surfaces invert controls and make everything stiffen on some builds. itâ€™s only fixed by deleted and replacing the pilot seat every single time you load it in.
bug-reports 2022-07-05 20:31:57 normal plot
bug-reports 2022-07-05 20:32:18 no joystick since iâ€™m ipad

bug-reports 2022-07-05 20:37:32 how
bug-reports 2022-07-05 20:40:20 https://streamable.com/c15bfp
bug-reports 2022-07-05 20:40:33 bomber isnâ€™t even done and itâ€™s already glitched
bug-reports 2022-07-05 20:41:18 look at the joystick movement to see how itâ€™s wrong
bug-reports 2022-07-05 20:42:12 maybe it has something to do with the wheels?
bug-reports 2022-07-05 20:42:20 since theyâ€™re car wheels
bug-reports 2022-07-05 20:42:24 hm
bug-reports 2022-07-05 20:42:53 well
bug-reports 2022-07-05 20:42:57 if it helps
bug-reports 2022-07-05 20:43:05 the problem started after i added the gear
bug-reports 2022-07-05 20:43:24 k
bug-reports 2022-07-05 20:43:32 brb
bug-reports 2022-07-05 20:44:59 no difference ðŸ˜­
bug-reports 2022-07-05 21:33:32 nice until you cant roll or yaw and the plane randomly dives or climbs at times
help 2022-07-05 21:36:22 Donâ€™t let any blocks touch the motor or the gear. You can use half wedges or trails and connect them to a hover thruster or a half cylinder using a 1x2 text or sign.
creations-chat 2022-07-05 21:37:37 lol yeah that is
help 2022-07-05 21:37:57 np
help 2022-07-05 21:38:13 if you need more help you can send me a friend request and iâ€™ll show you some of my gears
bug-reports 2022-07-08 14:30:40 theyâ€™re not flipped because flipping control surfaces on mobile doesnâ€™t do anything
bug-reports 2022-07-08 14:30:57 and itâ€™s not useful or realistic because you canâ€™t turn at all
bug-reports 2022-07-08 14:31:02 it turns on itâ€™s own
bug-reports 2022-07-08 14:42:15 so nobody has a fix for inverted controls?
bug-reports 2022-07-18 01:20:29 @everyone
bug-reports 2022-07-18 01:20:33 oops wrong one
