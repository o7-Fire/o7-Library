creations-chat 2021-05-05 17:44:56 want me to create a discord & roblox account for my 6 year old sister?
also she had the idea, me and her built it.
creations-chat 2021-05-05 18:07:33 literally one of the Zeppelins from a Roblox Game where you fight with Zeppelins.
creations-chat 2021-05-05 18:09:44 try to be more original & creative, atleast that is my opinion,  also you could be more soft, like asking "How could i improve?" instead of "Why downvote"
creations-chat 2021-05-05 18:11:49 Downvote me or not, that is your opinion
also that is not a valid excuse, i just dont like how you 1/1 copied it from the Zeppelin wars.
creations-chat 2021-05-05 18:14:09 he just copied a Zeppelin from a Roblox game, so i did not like it, and downvoted it, now he is complaining about me downvoting it, also he advertised his Creation here too, misuse of the channels
creations-chat 2021-05-05 18:16:17 you **did not** have good intentions, you are just trying to get expert designer.
creations-chat 2021-05-05 18:18:27 i dont have to upvote your creation because you have putten some effort in it , im not going to change my opinion about this, stop trying.
creations-chat 2021-05-05 18:20:50 its so obvious that he made it to get Expert Designer, he did not have good intentions, he even advertised his own post here ( <#504436696021204992> )
<@!756523831585275905> i dont have any problems with vehicles that were based off games or Real Vehicles, he just had bad intentions while doing it.
creations-chat 2021-05-05 18:24:13 <@!626036997546442763> he did not made that build to pay Tributes to the Zeppelin Wars, he is just lying about the Tribute part, he made it to get Expert Designer, i dont have a problem with that, he "advertised" his own build here too
<@!701949629708632096> i can tell that that build is not that hard to make
creations-chat 2021-05-05 18:26:25 can i just leave that conversation and continue chatting here? i have to answer something.
creations-chat 2021-05-05 18:29:29 like Pepsi said, **run**

creations-chat 2021-12-14 17:49:40 small enough for the millitary

creations-chat 2021-12-14 17:52:45 literally in every pic
creations-chat 2021-12-14 17:55:07 the height is 1 block, you can take out the wheels which are 1m sideways
you aren't gonna ship it pre-built right?
creations-chat 2021-12-14 17:59:00 1 block is 1m
creations-chat 2021-12-14 18:02:30 no i defined my height as 1 block = 1m, which is true after you put the wheels in the middle compartment
creations-chat 2021-12-14 18:04:41 that's how you avoid radar
the middle part is 5m
creations-chat 2021-12-14 18:07:01 yeah and why is that a negative
creations-chat 2021-12-14 18:09:54 how the fuck does the scaling system work, it can fit in a broad train track
creations-chat 2021-12-14 18:12:19 are you saying that im short <:ElonSad:573361014112780303>

i just like it so i do it, it doesn't have to be good i still like it.
creations-chat 2021-12-14 19:02:49 some guy kept arguing that 2 blocks equals 1m, idk how Plane Crazy handles that
creations-chat 2021-12-14 19:06:26 this is like my only good build i made, Confusedcat made the bogie for me

creations-chat 2022-03-12 10:59:32 what's with people downvoting this, it's looks pretty solid.
creations-chat 2022-03-12 11:01:42 gotta love how tryhards literally downvote anything that is not eye candy or didn't use motor lock %90 of the time
creations-chat 2022-03-12 11:04:19 like u <:trollface:775024642104229898>
creations-chat 2022-03-12 11:06:38 the slowmode is 2 minutes, probably not

creations-chat 2022-03-12 11:12:11 nope, even if i did, it would be the only action you would have for a another 10 years
creations-chat 2022-03-12 11:14:14 oh what did you expect? eye candy? motor lock? signs? camo? trails?
creations-chat 2022-03-12 11:16:21 it isn't even based on a real vehicle, what you on? im not a bloody aeronautical engineer irl (even though i wanna be one in the future) i just made something in 30 minutes.
creations-chat 2022-03-12 11:18:30 don't tell me what to do, i am just playing this game for fun.
also im not a tryhard, i also don't have that much time to play plane crazy
just downvote it and call it a day
creations-chat 2022-03-12 11:20:38 it looked solid to me, and i wondered why people downvoted it.
problem?
creations-chat 2022-03-12 11:22:46 well it wouldn't have been like this if you didn't make a big deal of it.
creations-chat 2022-03-12 11:25:32 you all spend 5 hours making a bloody plane for internet points, and you call playing the game casually a excuse?
creations-chat 2022-03-12 11:29:45 get over it.
creations-chat 2022-03-12 11:31:49 never argued over that
creations-chat 2022-03-12 11:33:53 why are you acting like im guilty? i am not the one who fucking made a big deal out of a build.
creations-chat 2022-03-12 11:36:00 oh i am guilty because i asked why people didn't like that build?
creations-chat 2022-03-12 11:41:03 you mean, https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/504436696021204992/952163427990777866

creations-chat 2022-03-12 11:43:17 nope i am not the creator.
creations-chat 2022-03-12 11:45:23 you were harsh about it and i told you to downvote it and call it a day, but you kept going
