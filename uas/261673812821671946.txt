creations-chat 2020-10-21 14:42:15 Mobile’s harder to build on
creations-chat 2020-10-21 14:44:33 You gotta like angle your camera weird to place stuff, you don’t have the same mouse freedom on mobile as you do on pc
creations-chat 2020-10-21 15:14:23 I can literally confirm he’s on mobile, that’s my homie Flox_6
But I can understand that
creations-chat 2020-10-21 15:16:17 Ong it doesn’t even matter what you build it on. If it’s a neat build then it’s a neat build
creations-chat 2020-10-21 15:17:27 Compared to PC it’s a lot more challenging, the mouse is locked in one spot and you have to move your camera instead of just your mouse if you want to place a block, say, on the bottom of a car which you can’t reach on mobile
creations-chat 2020-10-21 15:19:29 The only person suggesting using mobile can get you clout is you bruh. Nobody else said anything about it

creations-chat 2020-10-30 01:50:14 It's a 3 fold tho 🤔

creations-chat 2020-10-30 01:51:23 yeah
creations-chat 2020-10-30 01:52:37 Not at all 😂 I'm like 90% done on the superstructure, the bridge is just a one story husk at this point. Bridge is gonna be mad hard to make due to the limited space and how i have to bring it out from inside of the ship

I'm planning on having two seperate stories and motorlock them together outside the ship
creations-chat 2020-10-30 01:53:51 Nah I gotta do this 🤮
creations-chat 2020-10-30 01:55:10 bro you're looking at ass motorlocking wym

ayo ong ong you see the ship though?? 👀
creations-chat 2020-10-30 01:56:19 It's a pretty simple concept to grasp ngl, I caught on pretty fast

creations-chat 2020-10-30 15:00:38 > not really Russia but the USSR
> 
> for some reason Soviet Russia is funny
<@!551806781609869313>  

Bro exactly mfs literally think communism is funny and praise it because it is “epic” and the political ideology of “our motherland” like no you’re not russian Michael your dad’s fuckin Italian
creations-chat 2020-10-30 15:02:58 This kid bruh it’s not even funny
creations-chat 2020-10-30 15:05:44 He didn’t confuse anything, he just thinks he’s funny

creations-chat 2020-11-04 12:58:36 > how can i fix nose going up,it just spins in air
<@!542429796962140207>  

I would recommend balancing the centers of mass and lift (try adding some wing panels in the tail) or add a bit of helium to the back. Or replace solid blocks with 0.15 density ballast blocks in the back.

Helium should be your last resort, it tends to slow down your plane
creations-chat 2020-11-04 13:13:21 > ok ty
