help 2020-12-13 19:20:33 May I ask a question?
help 2020-12-13 19:23:42 Ok, so I wanted to ask how to properly post a creation in the creations channel.
help 2020-12-13 19:23:53 Is there like a specific format to use? or a command?
help 2020-12-13 19:30:23 so if I wanted to have text, what would I do? Use the comment function?
help 2020-12-13 19:31:14 Ok, so post the image and text as the same message, gotcha. What about multiple pictures?
help 2020-12-13 19:33:49 Okay, and what if I accidentally do something wrong, I won't get in trouble right?
help 2020-12-13 19:34:01 Like just send a text message and then the picture on accident.
help 2020-12-13 19:35:01 Okay, thanks a bunch!

bug-reports 2021-03-22 15:22:49 Some of my saves get corrupted for no apparent reason, I made a build and saved it today and it already got corrupted. And by corrupted I mean some blocks are removed from the build.
bug-reports 2021-03-22 15:27:12 Nevermind, it seemed to have fixed itself by leaving and rejoining.
creations-chat 2021-05-23 12:38:16 its simple, just apply a insane amount of motor lock and it will eventually work, mostly try to work with motor lock bends.
creations-chat 2021-05-23 12:40:50 I like it, but what is it meant to be?
creations-chat 2021-05-23 12:54:08 bro i get that, but what type is it, like is it a howitzer or something
creations-chat 2021-05-23 12:57:07 ok then yeah its a good back
bug-reports 2021-10-23 17:02:25 sometimes, when you anchor while moving, the anchor locks in place, while the vehicle continues moving for a moment before also anchoring
bug-reports 2021-10-23 17:05:21 nope
bug-reports 2021-10-23 17:05:38 if you unanchor it'll throw the build back to where the anchor is
bug-reports 2021-10-23 17:19:00 fr?
bug-reports 2021-10-23 17:19:15 would've thought a visual bug wouldn't cause physics bugs
bug-reports 2021-10-23 17:43:27 huh
