help 2022-10-22 15:46:34 how do i add more details to this without making it look like a discount anaconda?
bot-central 2023-01-01 21:21:30 !rank
help 2023-01-02 19:49:39 you need level 3
help 2023-01-02 19:49:48 to get levels
help 2023-01-02 19:49:50 you just gotta chat
help 2023-01-02 19:58:24 is there a way to cram a carriage onto this with folding techniques
help 2023-01-03 01:26:37 that would've been possible, if not for roblox physics
help 2023-01-03 01:26:53 even if you have a really good locking mechanism, you or the other dude would glitch out of the lock
help 2023-01-03 01:27:07 sadly, it's theoretically possible, but for now
help 2023-01-03 01:27:12 not happening anytime soon
help 2023-01-03 01:27:39 magnets don't interact with other player's creations
help 2023-01-03 01:27:40 only your own
help 2023-01-03 01:27:56 yeah sure
help 2023-01-03 01:28:24 well, yeah sure but
help 2023-01-03 01:28:36 do you mean like
help 2023-01-03 01:28:39 in terms of the model
help 2023-01-03 01:28:41 or functionality
help 2023-01-03 01:28:48 yeah that's literally what i just said
help 2023-01-03 01:29:04 in terms of modeling, maybe not
help 2023-01-03 01:29:05 you can just
help 2023-01-03 01:29:08 use your own design
help 2023-01-03 01:29:12 aerodynamic physics don't apply
help 2023-01-03 01:29:13 but if you want
help 2023-01-03 01:29:21 you can just copy how a drone looks irl
help 2023-01-03 01:29:32 either way is fine, as long as it's actually balanced
help 2023-01-03 01:29:38 and for functionality
help 2023-01-03 01:29:40 drones are like
help 2023-01-03 01:29:45 stupid complicated irl
help 2023-01-03 01:29:51 i don't think you can mimic that in plane crazy
help 2023-01-03 01:30:00 just slap 4 propellers on the drone
help 2023-01-03 01:30:07 that's basically what drones are
help 2023-01-03 01:30:52 are you plotting to stuff a smaller land vehicle in one of them?
help 2023-01-03 01:31:10 i have absolutely no idea what you mean
help 2023-01-03 01:31:21 sadly, that's also up to how roblox physics decide if they wanna work or not
help 2023-01-03 01:31:32 the tank inside will literally just completely glitch out
help 2023-01-03 01:31:34 or any other land vehicle
help 2023-01-03 01:31:53 i don't see why you need to protect your propeller blades from getting bent
help 2023-01-03 01:31:57 we're playing plane crazy, not real life
help 2023-01-03 01:32:06 just go ham on your drone model, as long as it's balanced
help 2023-01-03 01:33:37 said this twice already but
help 2023-01-03 01:33:45 theoretically, what you've been already doing WOULD work
help 2023-01-03 01:33:51 it's just that roblox physics say no to that
help 2023-01-03 01:34:02 comes down to something called client sided
help 2023-01-03 01:34:10 just won't work man, take my word for it
help 2023-01-03 01:34:25 if you locked something together, it will stay together
help 2023-01-03 01:34:33 if you even try to move it, it'll start crumbling apart
help 2023-01-03 01:34:38 the locks would do nothing
help 2023-01-03 01:35:10 i don't got a big plane or any aero vehicle, but i can just make a big box and strap rockets under it
help 2023-01-03 01:35:13 it'll give a similar result
help 2023-01-03 01:35:17 try to stuff a car into that box
help 2023-01-03 01:35:21 and once i blast off the box
help 2023-01-03 01:35:23 the car will glitch out

help 2023-01-03 02:49:37 submitting reports to rick won't warrant a warning anymore
help 2023-01-03 02:49:53 apparently, the reports channel is completely closed until the foreseeable future
help 2023-01-03 02:50:02 2/3 of the mods are busy with other things
help 2023-01-03 02:50:06 leaving one moderator to do all the work
help 2023-01-03 02:50:14 which is not very practical
help 2023-01-03 02:50:52 the only thing you can't report to rick is copied builds, and fowl language though
help 2023-01-03 06:18:05 should probably be a bit more specific with that
help 2023-01-03 06:18:18 i'll say some really basic things for now
help 2023-01-03 06:18:24 if you don't have gravity slider
help 2023-01-03 06:18:28 just put helium on it
help 2023-01-03 06:18:38 make sure all the helium has apply to center on
help 2023-01-03 06:19:05 are they just made out of blocks
help 2023-01-03 06:19:08 no wing panels?
help 2023-01-03 06:19:15 no wing panels at all?
help 2023-01-03 06:19:37 you do realize that
help 2023-01-03 06:19:42 right
help 2023-01-03 06:19:42 you need wing panels
help 2023-01-03 06:19:47 aerodynamics don't exist in this game
help 2023-01-03 06:21:26 when you said your spaceship won't fly
help 2023-01-03 06:21:30 did you mean like
help 2023-01-03 06:21:34 it just won't lift off the ground at all
help 2023-01-03 06:21:38 or like, it didn't have a 0G effect
help 2023-01-03 06:22:13 is it pointing up in build mode
help 2023-01-03 06:22:55 yeah, either your thing is severely underpowered, or it's the fact that you have no wingpanels to lift up your plane to begin with
help 2023-01-03 06:23:23 probably has to do with the wing panels then
help 2023-01-03 06:23:40 if it can go down really well for some reason, then that's the sign it's related to not having enough lift with wing panels
help 2023-01-03 06:23:46 and by wing panels, i meant like
help 2023-01-03 06:23:51 ones on motor 2's and stuff
help 2023-01-03 06:24:06 or you just have to spam a bunch of control surfaces inside the wing
help 2023-01-03 06:24:49 depends on if you want the motors to be concealed
help 2023-01-03 06:24:55 you don't need motorlock to make it look good
help 2023-01-03 06:25:07 you said your wings are just
help 2023-01-03 06:25:10 made out of blocks and stuff
help 2023-01-03 06:25:11 right
help 2023-01-03 06:25:14 no wing panels at all?
help 2023-01-03 06:25:20 like, it's not a flat wing made of wing panels
help 2023-01-03 06:26:07 try to be as quick as possible, it's a bit late over here in my timezone
help 2023-01-03 06:26:16 i'll just give a quick explanation for now
help 2023-01-03 06:26:31 if you want the custom control surfaces (aka motor 2's and wing panels) to work properly
help 2023-01-03 06:26:37 you'd need a motor 2 first
help 2023-01-03 06:26:44 make sure the hinge is pointing forwards
help 2023-01-03 06:26:50 which is the yellow thing
help 2023-01-03 06:27:00 go into the settings, and set the motor 2 speed to 50
help 2023-01-03 06:27:08 and max angle to be like
help 2023-01-03 06:27:12 40
help 2023-01-03 06:27:15 or around 60
help 2023-01-03 06:27:22 you don't need servo enabled for that
help 2023-01-03 06:27:32 when you got that
help 2023-01-03 06:27:35 it should probably work like
help 2023-01-03 06:27:39 a normal control surface
help 2023-01-03 06:27:45 but with a lot more lift since it's an entire wing panel
help 2023-01-03 06:27:55 just put a wing panel ontop of a motor2 in summary
help 2023-01-03 06:28:00 it's a really easy thing to do
help 2023-01-03 06:28:29 you just gotta make sure nothing is touching the custom control surface
help 2023-01-03 06:28:37 or the motor2, depending on it's rotation
help 2023-01-03 15:39:48 i think you got the wrong channel
help 2023-01-04 01:01:55 magnets are very buggy
help 2023-01-04 01:02:18 seems legit

creations-chat 2023-01-11 15:43:33 well they did kinda ask if their mech's cool or not, and i don't think their mech would look nearly as cool if it was paraplegic

creations-chat 2023-01-12 23:18:14 still haven't gotten any advice for this, and i still can't think of any ideas if my crippling autism keeps rudely interfering. it also literally has ZERO motorlock
