creations-chat 2020-12-16 23:41:57 this is my Anti-Shredder shredder, i did a big brain move using shredders against shredders, it has a disconnector  to disconnect the cutter part, i plan using these against shredders, what do you guys think
creations-chat 2020-12-16 23:44:28 yea, i managed to kill 5-7 shredders with it
creations-chat 2020-12-16 23:46:40 honestly im not proud of it, just asking what do you guys think of the concept using shredders against shredders, i expect negative comments from this
creations-chat 2020-12-16 23:48:50 it has a discarding cutter part, so i can remove it when i am peaceful
