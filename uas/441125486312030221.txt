creations-chat 2020-10-18 14:09:26 Ahh yes, 4,700 piece tutorial.. is that a question or a statement?
creations-chat 2020-10-18 14:12:09 I hand built my C-5 taking up to 6 days, I made 2 types, one was a testbed, proof of concept that the door and then gear works, and after proving such, I made the full thing again

Can you give me a link?
creations-chat 2020-10-18 14:14:26 Oh I saw that, that looks hideous
creations-chat 2020-10-18 14:16:07 I actually never saw the video, I saw someone that made it, it looked soooo terrible, and the good news about mine is that the gear is accurate to the real thing, unlike this one
creations-chat 2020-10-18 14:18:47 There 3 parts for this build... But I stg that I didn't use a tutorial.. mine has an interior and the cool ladder in the vertical stabilisor
creations-chat 2020-10-18 14:21:22 Imagine making a full scale build that takes 6 whole days, recreating every small detail.. just to have it be called a tutorial build.
creations-chat 2020-10-18 14:23:12 I need a vacation... The effort I did on this.... Mine looks nothing like that, I have working gear .. I ALWAYS MAKE ACCURATE WORKING GEAR IN MY BUILDS
creations-chat 2020-10-18 14:25:21 Se ages ago I asked for help in this server to help designing the new gear, I got advise that didn't help at all so I spent the next few hours with a few friends, all working together to design a small reliable gear mechanism that fits in my plane.. and after a while we got one that I placed in the build.. this wasn't just me who made it, it was with another 2 legendary strangers that helped me every step of the way

i dont know üòÇ

So, I actually used pistons to retract certain wheels, so that they wont inhibit the turn, or derail the train, it took a while, but it works like a treat
creations-chat 2021-06-06 02:07:55 Thanks!

bug-reports 2021-06-07 12:49:50 I've never seen this before, the oscilations of my inner elevons
bug-reports 2021-06-07 12:53:26 I do not think it is lag.. I mean, my build is going slow when i record, but it occurs at normal speeds
bug-reports 2021-06-07 12:55:54 They aren't directly connected to any motor locks, but could be affected by it. but this has never happened before
bug-reports 2021-06-07 12:57:09 it still occurs at 100, ill go to 30 tho
bug-reports 2021-06-07 12:57:30 it doesn't jam tho.. it just oscillates
bug-reports 2021-06-07 12:57:58 yep, still at 30 \:(
bug-reports 2021-06-07 12:58:40 This motor is directly connected to the aircraft body itself, not connected to any other motors

bug-reports 2021-06-11 07:51:58 i have reset, i am in a VIP server.. and i havent tried switching servers yet
bug-reports 2021-06-11 07:52:46 oh i finished typing all of that and the plane is here.. but i still cant press buttons
bug-reports 2021-06-11 07:54:39 oh yea ... it (buttons) works now :/
creations-chat 2021-08-12 08:53:49 I've tried putting the name on the side, but it seems like every effort i make into it makes it look worse
creations-chat 2021-08-12 08:55:56 I understand it is plain without the text, but i feel like it looks really bad with it, I cant find a way to make it work, although i have been trying
creations-chat 2021-08-12 08:57:58 Alright, I can see what I can do with the nose, thanks for the feedback :>

Yea, i've also looked into that, i think the best i can do is motor lock, but i've tried that and it still looks really weird
creations-chat 2021-08-12 11:27:13 Sure, But I'm a bit busy right now, If you remind me tomorrow I can, DM me if you really want to (I doubt you or I will remember this tomorrow)
creations-chat 2021-10-21 23:06:51 <@!662306868567343105> i saw you in a public server with the golden glider - it looked so sick, i really like what you've done with the back too
creations-chat 2021-10-22 00:34:40 well, it just throttles up and slides really
creations-chat 2021-10-23 02:50:14 Thoughts?

bot-central 2021-10-23 02:52:21 oh
bot-central 2021-10-23 02:52:23 not bad
bot-central 2021-10-23 02:52:41 i had no idea
bot-central 2021-10-23 02:52:47 i guess i gotta talk more üëÄ
creations-chat 2021-10-23 03:03:42 Surprisingly, It can
creations-chat 2021-10-23 03:06:35 It has pretty good suspension that gives it enough traction to go straight or turn when i want it to
creations-chat 2021-10-23 03:21:21 alright.. that's gonna be hard because of the motor lock placement
creations-chat 2021-10-23 03:36:58 <@!867076951293820958> 
I got my motor lock to work surprisingly - it's weird because I'm using a new method of motor locking, usually I hide it inside - but now I'm using it as the surface (you cant tell tho üòâ)

here's the old link too

creations-chat 2021-10-23 03:45:29 yup
creations-chat 2021-10-23 03:50:00 the trailer has little stands too (idk what they're called.. probably 'stilts')
creations-chat 2021-10-23 03:53:54 I looked it up, they're called 'Landing Gear'

Kinda easy to remember because I'm a pilot xD
creations-chat 2021-10-23 04:05:32 Phone
.. or use links
creations-chat 2021-10-23 04:10:22 no seriously it is actually called that
creations-chat 2021-10-23 04:13:46 Well, it wasn't a flex ... so thanks for the compliment?
The number 1 rule to knowing if someone is a pilot is that they'll tell you üòÇ 
And thanks :>
creations-chat 2021-10-23 04:16:00 O.o
creations-chat 2021-10-23 04:25:19 is it because you don't think it's easy? or thinking of it seems somewhat intimidating and/or offputting?

creations-chat 2021-10-23 22:57:39 Did someone just make Striker Eureka from Pacific Rim and not caption it?
help 2021-10-23 22:59:16 So you know if the door is welded? So it cannot move? And what motor are you using? (and what is the settings of it?)
creations-chat 2021-10-23 23:01:57 That's a shame <@729112434639503470>  - maybe caption your posts, I think it'll help people understand what they are seeing (also so people can search it up and see your build)
creations-chat 2021-10-23 23:03:58 Your 'posts' in general - pictures, videos, anything you post in <#384025409945337856>  - it just helps (you don't have to btw, it's advice.. a suggestion)
creations-chat 2021-10-24 01:47:59 Ilike what you did with the colour, it makes it look 2x better
creations-chat 2021-10-24 07:34:45 Alrighty, I've fixed the truck - how does it look now?
creations-chat 2021-10-24 07:37:18 ** **
Here's the Inspiration material - and what it used to look like before my feedback (also, ignore the lights and bars on the "real" model)
creations-chat 2021-10-24 07:57:12 the last time i posted it, it was really the 2nd image (with tad better colour) - this one has the colour perfected i believe, so possibly hof worthy :>
creations-chat 2021-10-24 08:08:01 sure .. but what should the text say? (this is 80% up to you, 10% Roblox text tag algorithm and 10% bias xD )
creations-chat 2021-10-24 08:10:25 "RUNNER" and other things idk
creations-chat 2021-10-24 08:14:07 Maybe put a whole shrine for it

like a pathway leading to it with some roman looking columns
*fire and explosions - idk*

no, you can't modify it (I believe), but you can repost it
creations-chat 2021-10-24 08:26:19 :>
creations-chat 2021-10-24 08:49:59 \:D (I didn't expect you to listen to me ngl - but that's what I am here for, and that's what this channel is here for)

bug-reports 2021-10-24 09:13:22 Nope üòï
bug-reports 2021-10-24 09:14:17 - I can type something else in.. and then change it and it works
bug-reports 2021-10-24 09:14:55 uhh... i have no clue, and it's not working with some words

creations-chat 2021-10-24 12:19:58 That could be the angle, or the fact that it's not possible to lower the visor without changing the roof because of the way I put together the motor lock

It is meant to be tall as it's the 'High' variant, but ok, I might change it then for ya :3 I'll see what I can do
creations-chat 2021-10-24 12:24:17 Here are old images - I'm using these because the height didn't change here

creations-chat 2021-10-25 10:58:09 feedbakk on this too?
creations-chat 2021-10-27 09:19:43 will you angle the cockpit and nose down?  like what you commonly see in the real life aircraft?
creations-chat 2021-10-27 09:24:50 ooo nice .. i cant really see it if it is - i think i need the rest of the plane for comparison - but if you say it is - then the finished product will look amazing ‚ú®
creations-chat 2021-10-27 09:31:12 Sadly relatable, I love building extremely detailed builds, but the part count sky rockets and it's harder to PVP - One of my builds which I'm quite proud of has a "low" (about under 1000) part count for high detail - But it's pretty bad at PVP because i put looks over functionality and maneuverability

creations-chat 2021-10-28 09:31:28 Thoughts on my somewhat buggy B-52?
creations-chat 2021-10-28 09:36:13 well, how i did it here was using a powered locked motor and a piston to get it to look flush (im not putting that effort into the bomb bay doors as it opens differently)
but theres a lot of motor lock involved to get the gear in (not the doors, but some for that too)

the motor lock was only to get the gears to be 45*'s off
creations-chat 2021-10-28 09:38:26 yes, they are :>
creations-chat 2021-10-29 14:32:31 Thoughts on the B-52 so far? (the tail will be longer, it's just what i can fit in the space so far - oh and ignore the top, it's a mess)
(It isn't a specific type, like B-52**D** or B-52**H**)

creations-chat 2021-11-02 16:33:20 Ooooo TheMoYouKnow 
But I have a similar unbalanced issue with my rocket, I just have to add more wings to it
creations-chat 2021-11-02 22:42:28 yea.. when you take photos or snippets of something, try and hide your cursor, because its kinda .. idk but it gives me anxiety - i just wanted to see the cockpit windows, it looks a bit small, I cant see the tail, but it looks like it just ends instead of gets smaller? idk it could be the angle, other than that it looks really good
creations-chat 2021-11-02 22:44:43 nono, all good - sorry for mine really

creations-chat 2021-11-11 02:07:26 Sure, I will do that >:3 - what livery though?
creations-chat 2021-11-11 02:22:44 Well, I didn't plan to just make the -H version, I planned to make an older version, you've told me the -C so i'll do it, i just need a livery
creations-chat 2021-11-11 02:52:50 I'd like that.. but I have no space to put the X-15

creations-chat 2021-11-16 07:48:44 so what exactly is wrong with the nose.. "it's flat" ?

The B-52G/H has a more pointy nose than it's predecessors, i tried to replicate it here - and here are some reference images of a B-52G/H and a B-52C/D

Interesting y'all say that

(I kept the aspect ratio the same - I promise)
creations-chat 2021-11-16 08:06:13 that really is interesting - though they're taken at slightly different angles that it might give the illusion of that - anyways, I'll see if I make it flatter, see what it looks like
creations-chat 2021-11-16 08:09:02 I uhhh.. don't see a way to make it flatter.. without making it look worse
creations-chat 2021-11-16 08:11:15 Well, If i use a half wedge for the tip (very middle section) - then the parts next to it will not be able to be flush with the nose.. and even completely redesigning won't achieve the desired outcome 

it is the thing in your mirror <@!721103577380159490> üòâ

creations-chat 2021-12-09 12:00:31 thoughts? opinions?
creations-chat 2021-12-09 12:04:57 but......... no?
creations-chat 2021-12-09 12:09:57 swept back by 5 degrees i think
creations-chat 2021-12-09 12:19:19 first of all the foul language is unnecessary, and it isn't too thin, maybe the blue stripe makes it look thinner but it isn't too thin 

but interesting you say the tail is too long... i messed up the motor lock there though that makes it look too thin, thanks for that, i'll fix that up
creations-chat 2021-12-09 12:26:00 did you just compare a Tupolev Tu-144(with no designation) with my Tupolev Tu-144D

that blueprint is incorrect to my build, It's like classifying german shepards with huskies

The tu-144D has a different wing, different engines, it has different gear placement and the original doesnt even have canards
creations-chat 2021-12-09 12:29:41 basically, the fuselage isn't too thin
creations-chat 2021-12-09 12:32:32 that's the thing, there isn't any decent ones
creations-chat 2021-12-09 12:35:09 sheesh you're toxic... it's because you're comparing a plane that's basically totally different to mine and saying im incorrect
creations-chat 2021-12-09 12:38:44 there's actually quite a few Tu-144's, the prototype was built without canards, when the soviets made their first "actual" tu-144, the Tu-144S, they fixed everything that went wrong with the first, including changing the size of the aircraft, with bigger wings and a longer body
creations-chat 2021-12-09 12:42:28 Sadly, no red

and no, those arent flaps <@!754217246729175090>, the Tu-144 doesn't have flaps, what you're seeing in that image is just the control column pushed forward to make the control surfaces go down (also because gravity helps do that)

<@!719168864705052802> I think I'm not stupid as i literally can tell you every individual difference of the Tu-144 and Tu-144D - starting with the **dimensions** - please do your research before you tell me off \:)
creations-chat 2021-12-09 12:46:52 I can tell you what isn't accurate with my build is the door placement due to the canards needing more space because plane crazy wont let them deploy üòî
(that's a bad image to show the doors and canards.. but here :> )
creations-chat 2021-12-09 12:52:02 yes, because he doesn't know any better ü§∑ 


and yea, that's why I'm not trying to trigger him by being toxic back, I don't want this community to become a warzone more than it already can be

Anyways, I'll just ignore him if he gets any worse :>
creations-chat 2021-12-09 13:01:23 Yep :3
creations-chat 2021-12-09 13:05:32 I mean yea, but I wouldn't insult him for not knowing - i'll admit i could've been more informative with the context - but regardless, he threw punches before i corrected him
creations-chat 2021-12-10 01:00:50 Thank you :>

creations-chat 2021-12-12 13:27:54 üòé
creations-chat 2021-12-20 05:37:39 If that's an F-35 I think the wings looks a bit long - if you don't think so, then maybe the engine intakes are a bit slim
creations-chat 2021-12-20 05:54:31 understandable :>
creations-chat 2021-12-20 06:02:23 Are you familiar with *\*dramatic pause\** **motor lock**

No but there's always a crazy amount of detail one could put in when they learn motor lock xD
If you don't want to, the only thing i can say is the intakes but other than that, it's pretty good \:D
creations-chat 2021-12-20 06:07:44 Motor lock was a big learning curve for me, I don't want to call myself good at it, but I think I've got the hang of it to extents that surprise even myself xD

If you ever need help, the community (and me) is here to help :>
creations-chat 2021-12-29 10:37:59 <@456226577798135808>, I like the 777, however it's hard to see everything with the small images, could you make it larger for me (and others) too see it

creations-chat 2022-05-23 01:41:56 no i can agree, i've noticed how peoples standards are to have almost everything perfect and in proportion

people have different skill levels and not everyone can appreciate that
creations-chat 2022-05-23 01:46:26 I really think there needs to be a change in this server to make it more inclusive and inviting and much less toxic - but eh, i can't do anything.. just eat popcorn and watch the community having fun having a go at one another

creations-chat 2022-06-02 01:36:07 oooo nice, i like it :>
creations-chat 2022-06-02 01:40:38 oh well, i can't judge the paint yet because i'm not 100% sure what I'll be looking at
(I hope i'm looking at the correct variant when i say this) but the only thing i think is the scoop on the bottom might be a bit too pronounced, if it's possible, move it in a bit to make it more flight  
-  Other than that, (and the long prop) i think it looks perfect

contest-chat 2022-07-15 23:48:28 sure but let me do the research first so I don't somehow mess up
contest-chat 2022-07-15 23:50:44 I'm just thinking if i should build a 10*10\*10 block or make one that's the size of the plot that isn't over 1000

creations-chat 2022-07-20 02:55:14 I'm making a commercial aircraft - how should i make the passenger doors?, I'm looking into using trapdoors for functionality and trails for the outline - but should i make doors swivel out? and how?
creations-chat 2022-07-20 02:58:10 but that would most likely cause exposed motors :despair:
creations-chat 2022-07-24 10:47:24 Feedback on my Boeing 747 (I'll paint it later, It also has an interior I need to paint too)
creations-chat 2022-07-24 10:51:17 Thank you, this makes sense

I see, thanks:>
creations-chat 2022-07-24 11:05:26 yes, the spoilers, 3 part slotted Fowler flaps and Kruger slats all work
creations-chat 2022-07-24 11:37:55 do you think i should trade off functionality for looks and make the windows text blocks instead?
creations-chat 2022-07-24 11:40:46 Noted :> - I think I'll make both, but I need one good airline for it, I need idea's on which that would be though
creations-chat 2022-07-25 05:10:57 <@691825046590718111> How familiar are you with custom angle motor lock? - because I think this will be the next steps with your builds  -  My feedback on the A321 is to work a bit more on the gear (because It looks like the main gear won't be completely flush, maybe you could make it better). I'd love it if you could get the nose to retract forwards than backwards but that would most likely require custom angles
creations-chat 2022-07-25 06:23:01 Yes it's Ro-Scale, how could you tell?
creations-chat 2022-07-25 06:31:30 They're Japanese (presumably) so they're small
creations-chat 2022-07-27 05:18:53 it looks so amazing so far, I like how you're going with the -200B though, I haven't seen many of those - I have not much feedback except maybe the hump could look a bit smoother, however it's still amazing

Anyways, I'm showing you mine that I just finished (kind of) but I really like what you got so far
creations-chat 2022-07-27 05:20:57 Is my Boeing 747 "average"?

üòî 
How may I make it more than average then?
creations-chat 2022-07-27 05:23:23 may i see the cockpit windows better? I think I should change mine actually
creations-chat 2022-07-27 05:26:17 <@401530469952389130>  Sure, I'll redo the engines - The Livery will come soon don't worry about that >:) and how do/would I add more detail in general? - what should I add or change?

<@633408435601276945> that looks amazing!, the rear window looks a bit squished but other than that that's superb
creations-chat 2022-07-27 05:40:25 <@401530469952389130> I'm just saying - without intent to put down others but to convey my message I kinda have too - I personally would not have called my 747 "average" or "mid", it's certainly better than other peoples airliners - but I agree that it isn't the best, just certainly better

And I'm not going to add window frames because the outline of the doors will be masked a little bit by the windows (I've already tried and experimented and I don't like it)

<@633408435601276945> no problem mate, good luck
creations-chat 2022-07-27 06:01:11 ahhh i see, you've succeeded at fucking with me, i was indeed very fucked
creations-chat 2022-07-27 08:01:56 are you saying the fuselage is vertically challenged? - because.. it isn't? it might be the angle.. I can take another later
creations-chat 2022-07-27 12:50:19 Thoughts?
creations-chat 2022-09-01 23:12:15 good song :>
creations-chat 2022-09-08 07:00:24 Make the rudder bigger - the rear most cockpit windows don't tilt that much down so if you could find a substitute or just remove it entirely, then yues
The gear looks kinda big tbh but idk how to fix that though - and I know it's a -200 but the engines look a bit small, idk how, but it would look much better if they could be a tad bit bigger - do some research into the Rolls Royce Trent 800's or Pratt And Whitney PW4000's

creations-chat 2022-09-28 10:05:05 oh wow interesting
creations-chat 2022-09-28 10:07:09 I've seen 3 today excluding my attempt at one - anyways I don't have an answer to your thingo, but just trial and error to see what works, usually if you want an interior, it helps for more space so a half works, but doesnt look good - so you do what you think will work or just motor lock something completely different to see if that works instead - i always do trial and error, it helps to get the best outcome of what i want
creations-chat 2022-09-29 15:51:00 Name the plane ü§î - and feedback?  (and just note, the retraction sequence is built with wobble, i could fix it but i dont want to, i really just care about it retracted and deployed)
creations-chat 2022-09-29 15:56:40 <@873156568659681290> not a 747
<@362779578282016790> It is very wobbly, but so much less wobbly than previously where it's just kraken and nothing works - it is all motor 2's and im trying to see if i can find a way to get it to work without changing motors, adding pistons, increasing space (this needs to be hella compact) - i got another trick in the book - but the goal here is to reduce keybinds for automation because this is 2 out of 5 gear, and the nose gear needs all sorts of keybinds itself

creations-chat 2022-09-30 09:58:09 well it will depend on the airline you choose to pick, most pick rolls royce, it's also one of the trickiest to make - qantas for example though uses GE

creations-chat 2022-10-05 07:55:35 Thoughts? ü§î
creations-chat 2022-10-05 08:00:09 sure, I'll delete :3 - no i have no motivation to fix it up, it's an old build i made for the contest and didnt want to submit cuz I wasn't even comparable - despite my ability to custom angle motor lock, I'm pretty bad at it, especially with the tight parameters i got of having it all functional
creations-chat 2022-10-14 06:02:26 not only this actually but it can also be subjected to skill level - cuz when i started, my early builds i thought were amazing, not hall of fame worthy but i was proud - and now after years where i've gotten a bit better, those builds aren't as good as they seem - this could be subjected to other peoples builds as well (as critical as this may sound) - being better at the game makes other peoples builds a little less .. good
creations-chat 2022-10-14 06:32:04 he didn't tell what to fix - he mocked the random plane for it's looks instead of being constructive or even yet helpful

contest-chat 2022-11-10 13:30:49 I actually had a tunable ornithopter, so i could give it the perfect lift to drag ratio - but it didnt work well when hovering so i made one that hovers and goes forwards by toggling a motor 2
contest-chat 2022-11-10 13:31:05 the ornithopter im working on right now - has no space for any of that

contest-chat 2022-11-10 13:46:11 (red motor is the powered motor), the rest are unpowered - except the 3 at the back which are locked
contest-chat 2022-11-10 13:50:42 very unique design there, i like it - i have no clue if it would work or how effective it would be - but that's the trick with trial and error
contest-chat 2022-11-11 03:34:42 yes it is able to hover, i put 3 settings on it, hover, forward and downward - downward so it stays on the spot when i land it instead of going up or moving around
contest-chat 2022-11-11 03:35:29 the ornithopter im currently working on though cannot have this mechanism because it's too small to hold the mechanism
contest-chat 2022-11-11 10:51:35 on the off-chance (which is becoming more likely) that my ornithopter doesnt produce thrust itself, could I use rockets as a form of control surfaces and also propulsion to keep it airborne? üòÖ

help 2022-11-12 07:35:38 there's 3 ways to do this, you could use a single motor that moves half your ship behind the other half to make it longer, motor locking an entire section of ship behind the front - or a mix of both
help 2022-11-12 07:37:02 an example of using a single motor is like this, where one half of the boat will move behind the second half
help 2022-11-12 07:37:17 (the motor is connected by hidden blocks but we dont talk about that)
help 2022-11-12 07:38:45 this is the motor lock way - where in my case, the whole front will be locked onto the rest of the aircraft
help 2022-11-12 07:39:35 I do have the third way (both motorlock and unfolding motor) but I can't show it as its existence is a secret ü§≠

contest-chat 2022-11-12 08:33:04 it looks amazing tho üôÉ
contest-chat 2022-11-12 08:34:51 the trick though is to put motor lock everywhere but the door and have the minimal amount on the door to make it look good - basically the build is built around the door and its functionality for me
contest-chat 2022-11-12 08:36:17 oh yeah balance went out the window instantly
contest-chat 2022-11-12 08:36:45 > -Can NOT use helium or hover thrusters

contest-chat 2022-11-12 16:58:42 idk i feel like that is easy
contest-chat 2022-11-12 17:00:33 one motor 2 for yaw, and one motor for the blades itself - i dont know if ailerons or pitch also moves the rotors or not though
contest-chat 2022-11-13 01:14:16 sorry, i meant one to make it spin
contest-chat 2022-11-13 01:14:34 well how about a tilt-rotor design

contest-chat 2022-11-13 09:29:33 it looks crap ngl - so i wont show it just yet until i get more progress
contest-chat 2022-11-13 09:29:48 but i got to rebuild the front because the doors and windows looks terrible
contest-chat 2022-11-13 09:30:47 oh all the wings are on, but they dont use the flapping mechanism i made previously
contest-chat 2022-11-13 09:31:08 they are meant to wobble with the kracken but this isnt generating enough for thrust
contest-chat 2022-11-13 09:31:20 very compact for the interior >:D
contest-chat 2022-11-13 09:32:50 im the other way around üòÖ I want it to look good
contest-chat 2022-11-13 09:33:09 however this isnt working for me as the doors work, but doesnt look good enough
contest-chat 2022-11-13 09:39:13 so far i've made EVERYTHING functional on it just like the movies :>
contest-chat 2022-11-13 09:49:38 I'll be straight my wings do not flutter like an ornithopter, but they do go up down, change pitch and even fold backwards
I have got working front doors, landing gear legs, rear door which also works as landing gear leg platform and even an interior set up (but it looks crap right now) - the functional parts do not look as good as it could be if it doesn't work, but I'd rather have it all work than to be a perfect looking stationary model

contest-chat 2022-11-18 01:54:25 yeah tbh I want to show 2 images of the wings folded, gear down, doors open, and another of it in the air gears up, doors close, wings out, and flappin

contest-chat 2022-11-24 12:17:34 and yes, the wings and gear (and doors) all work >:D
contest-chat 2022-11-24 13:26:26 i honestly expect that myself üò¨
contest-chat 2022-11-24 13:36:11 I'm pretty happy with it myself :>
contest-chat 2022-11-24 15:19:49 it "works" as in it unfolds - it flaps really badly so i need to work on it some more
contest-chat 2022-11-24 15:20:07 later, and when i can iron out the kinks
contest-chat 2022-11-24 15:20:27 morfix - i do not stand a chance against that
contest-chat 2022-11-24 15:23:03 i kneel to your superiority, your build supersedes mine
contest-chat 2022-11-24 15:23:21 .... i said later!!!
contest-chat 2022-11-24 15:23:43 it does (not well, in the slightest) but it does

contest-chat 2022-11-25 10:54:31 <@965893740755562496> this is the contest
contest-chat 2022-11-25 10:57:19 no clue how to fix
contest-chat 2022-11-25 10:58:35 i think it's level 3
contest-chat 2022-11-25 10:58:47 so you just gotta keep typing and typing
contest-chat 2022-11-25 10:58:51 no spam of course
contest-chat 2022-11-26 14:04:08 about time - now i can submit my WIP :bigbrain:
contest-chat 2022-11-27 09:55:11 WAIT I DONT NEED TO MAKE IT WORK
contest-chat 2022-11-27 09:55:14 OHHHHH YEAAHHHHHHHH
contest-chat 2022-11-27 09:55:24 I'm rebuilding it again
contest-chat 2022-11-27 09:55:47 FARRRRRKKKK it took me forever to get it to flap reliably
contest-chat 2022-11-27 12:57:05 yes, i found a way to compact it by removing one side of the mechanism but linking it with the other so it still works in unison - i put it on my ornithopter WHICH I have already removed for a more reliable and compact mechanism
contest-chat 2022-11-27 12:59:44 it works - this is what i've got (it's not smooth because it's hitting the ground) but im still working on it of course
contest-chat 2022-11-27 13:04:46 and yeah, i traded some of the space for a mechanism to allow the wings to be directly offset when flapping
contest-chat 2022-11-27 13:17:24 but i sent this before.. all i've done was rework an entire flapping mechanism twice
contest-chat 2022-11-27 13:20:22 not anymore
contest-chat 2022-11-27 13:20:30 i was just told they dont need to produce lift
contest-chat 2022-11-27 13:21:16 they do help in controlling the aircraft, including roll and yaw
contest-chat 2022-11-27 13:21:29 technically pitch if i retract them in flight

contest-chat 2022-11-29 09:28:42 you think I flew it like a plane and anchored it??? you'd be mad! - and correct
contest-chat 2022-11-29 12:23:06 ohhh that's smart - i should've used that for testing
contest-chat 2022-11-29 12:26:54 you didn't ask the black hawk to send a video if it flying - so.. why me?
contest-chat 2022-11-29 12:27:55 are you... more interested in my build - or doubt my abilities to make a dragonfly fly
creations-chat 2022-11-29 12:33:15 if you need help, im here, i got a Tu-144 and I made a concorde nose for a friend who didnt want it so i deleted it üò¨  - but i can still help üôÇ

contest-chat 2022-11-30 06:05:52 also.. technically yes?
contest-chat 2022-11-30 06:06:04 edited üòë
contest-chat 2022-11-30 18:22:13 Yeah I didn't, any attempt to make it smaller rendered the flapping useless
contest-chat 2022-12-01 06:15:32 <@866848584888877077> Are reference images allowed? So people know that I'm not as bad a building as I may seem üëÄ

contest-chat 2022-12-03 01:42:06 I ...... ummmmmm
contest-chat 2022-12-03 01:42:18 Rotary aircraft .... not aircraft with rotors
contest-chat 2022-12-03 01:42:58 I don't think a Dash 8 Q400 counts as a VTOL either
contest-chat 2022-12-04 05:35:45 you can do it, i just built and completed a Boeing B-52D Stratofortress yesterday, and I started yesterday
contest-chat 2022-12-04 05:41:45 uhh lemme find
contest-chat 2022-12-04 05:42:18 have a snip

contest-chat 2022-12-05 03:48:58 wh.... uhhhh
contest-chat 2022-12-05 03:51:54 Slightly off topic - I find it pretty cool how I've improved so much in the game, that C5 aircraft i made is so bad to me now - i've rebuilt it with more compact gear, an improved door and tail, and custom angle lock everything - i didnt even use motor lock on that build
contest-chat 2022-12-05 03:54:13 But what I said there, I was just really happy that my first build was up to the standards of most others and not just constant downvotes, it really motivated me to keep playing - but honestly, it's really bad to my current standards now
creations-chat 2022-12-05 03:56:18 how good are you at custom angle motor lock?
creations-chat 2022-12-05 03:58:54 Lol
creations-chat 2022-12-05 04:01:02 Do you want help with custom angle motor locking? *get more skills?*

creations-chat 2022-12-06 04:30:42 be honest - so you can be harsh
creations-chat 2022-12-06 05:10:09 thanks :> and how could i improve both aircraft?
creations-chat 2022-12-06 05:24:52 I have got both the B-52D and B-52H, this -D has those smooth smaller turbojet engines, and the newer -H has the more powerful engines turbofans  (I don't know the types sadly) 
Also the -D has an internal bomb bay that's 100% usable (because it's the Big Belly aircraft), and the -H has a few Nukes in it that also drop

creations-chat 2022-12-06 05:37:46 <@862160384206962749> I'll be honest, I didn't quite understand what you just said - but I've loaded in and here's the engine, I have NO space for motor lock - but this is where the smoke pipe on the front is inspired from, how else could i improve it?
creations-chat 2022-12-06 07:09:46 very interesting but oki :>
oh i didnt bloody send the message

contest-chat 2022-12-06 07:28:52 but I agree with this, just let the man finish the heli
contest-chat 2022-12-07 01:32:14 yes, it is not a rotorcraft by defenition, but the contest does state that it does allow ornithopters
contest-chat 2022-12-07 01:43:30 yeah i had the same issue - twice
contest-chat 2022-12-07 01:43:40 just be safe and send 3 at a time

contest-chat 2022-12-07 07:40:58 I'd like to file a complaint against myself, I am disabled, gimme extra points for effort as compensation for smol brain
contest-chat 2022-12-07 07:42:09 - all jokes aside, I don't mind it at all, it's cool to think I could've came first if we didn't let the sea stallion in
contest-chat 2022-12-07 07:42:28 Plus, I think it's fun *and we always got next competition*
contest-chat 2022-12-07 07:43:28 Well so far the sea stallion has always been in first place
contest-chat 2022-12-07 07:44:03 Oh it's a king stallion, my bad - I made a sea stallion a while back hence the mix-up
contest-chat 2022-12-07 11:58:49 I got one rocket that is realistic - but now Roblox un-folds the locked motors and I can't use it anymore
contest-chat 2022-12-07 11:59:36 It's my proton M rocket <:nooo:787097964946259978>
contest-chat 2022-12-07 11:59:50 Is that good or bad?

contest-chat 2022-12-07 12:01:08 Oo yes it is
contest-chat 2022-12-07 12:02:52 It by definition, still works, but it doesn't unfold the bottom rockets into its proper position, or the trails that are in that weird interstage fairing
contest-chat 2022-12-07 12:03:37 Sheeesh
contest-chat 2022-12-07 12:04:22 Tbh I'm in the city so I'm using data - I'll check when I'm home

contest-chat 2022-12-07 12:09:03 I like your pfp btw
contest-chat 2022-12-07 12:15:12 I like looking back at it tbh
contest-chat 2022-12-07 12:15:26 Like what I should make for Christmas
contest-chat 2022-12-07 12:15:31 I still have no idea
contest-chat 2022-12-07 12:15:56 I was thinking a C-17 and dump prezzies inside to drop
contest-chat 2022-12-07 12:16:01 But that's bad
contest-chat 2022-12-07 12:17:11 Oh no I mean mine

contest-chat 2022-12-07 12:19:09 I like that idea a lot
contest-chat 2022-12-07 12:19:25 A gru rocket ship - but Christmas tree
contest-chat 2022-12-07 12:20:03 Loolll good ideas
contest-chat 2022-12-07 12:20:28 Imma actually do that though - unless I find something absolutely ground breaking to build
contest-chat 2022-12-07 12:20:55 The.. the first stage is recoverable? Or the final stage
contest-chat 2022-12-07 12:21:58 Good idea
contest-chat 2022-12-07 12:26:21 I'm going to say easy, I've made landing gears for all sorts of aircraft, this can't be too hard to fit a satellite in it.. right?
contest-chat 2022-12-07 12:30:15 Imma add your name to it if I remember
contest-chat 2022-12-07 12:30:35 Imma add it on a present box, which will be the satellite
contest-chat 2022-12-07 12:32:15 Sure thing... No clue how to make a small box and then have it telescope out into a telescope unless I turn it into a transformer but sure
contest-chat 2022-12-07 12:35:02 Noice
contest-chat 2022-12-07 12:37:00 I'm literally on a train, I'm planning to make a whole plot worth of gru rocket
contest-chat 2022-12-07 12:40:19 Sure thing,
contest-chat 2022-12-07 12:41:04 I was thinking of a 2x2x2 box with some blocks on top as bowties as the payload - so if you can turn that into a literal telescope, that'd be great

creations-chat 2022-12-08 02:20:10 so would all unpainted builds count as a WIP? - should they all be warned and posts deleted under the WIP rule?

contest-chat 2022-12-08 02:32:37 whoever gets the most DOWNVOTES wins ü§î
contest-chat 2022-12-08 02:42:15 you know what
contest-chat 2022-12-08 02:42:23 maybe it's best that i don't do this competition'
contest-chat 2022-12-14 09:59:30 start again - a week of progress aint much
contest-chat 2022-12-14 11:44:52 same, i've thought up plans though
contest-chat 2022-12-23 02:23:24 exposed motor!!!!!
contest-chat 2022-12-23 02:24:09 this looks really really good though :>
the mirrors look odd though, if it's possible, maybe angle it back
contest-chat 2022-12-23 03:40:56 üò±
contest-chat 2022-12-24 22:06:18 honestly i find it funny how when i first made custom angle motor lock, i put blocks in the way to stop the motor from turning at the point it needs to stop, i did this for all custom angle motors  - and now that roblox no work properly, only those builds are the ones that i can unfold
contest-chat 2022-12-24 22:09:35 also, i might not join this contest - i'm pretty busy and i haven't started
creations-chat 2022-12-24 22:12:45 this looks really good, i've made one myself with very similar methods (but i might get "inspiration" from this design)

also the tail is wonky
creations-chat 2022-12-24 22:14:48 yeah, you can see one piece is a bit further behind than the other
help 2023-01-01 13:31:28 i have been summoned
help 2023-01-01 13:31:58 so does everyone know me for my Ornithopter aircraft?
help 2023-01-01 13:33:04 I'll make a tutorial actually - however it will not be soon as I have no clue how to make videos
creations-chat 2023-01-08 00:21:34 nope.
creations-chat 2023-01-08 15:42:53 the seats all have individual colours on them for weathering, there's tray tables and head rests - but how else could I improve the interior?
creations-chat 2023-01-08 15:45:08 nope
creations-chat 2023-01-08 15:49:34 Well how else could I improve it?

<@809781295500099584> - I'll be honest, you are making not any sense
creations-chat 2023-01-08 15:53:28 üëå
creations-chat 2023-01-08 16:07:14 I wrote Tu-144 on the interior - not shown in that image though
creations-chat 2023-01-08 16:10:35 I also was supposed to get it to say Tupolev in Russian but I had issue regarding tags, I'll put it on tomorrow when I can


Very lucky simply, I'd love to hop in one myself
creations-chat 2023-01-08 16:12:55 Australia and it's 3 in the morning

And no, not wrong ping
creations-chat 2023-01-08 16:16:34 I'll be honest, it's 3 in the morning and these pings are what's keeping me up - I do but I responded with the first sentence to who I replied to and I just couldn't be bothered to ping Simply for the 2nd sentence (the one for them)
creations-chat 2023-01-08 16:25:37 Just like me fr

bot-central 2023-01-11 03:34:01 nice i guess
creations-chat 2023-01-16 10:07:52 Why your wings have so much holes in them? Do you know how to motor lock? Would you like help?
creations-chat 2023-01-17 02:54:18 your engines are so massive compared to the real thing üëÄ
creations-chat 2023-01-19 09:11:53 i... dont think that looks close to the real thing - no offence


ye, you got this mate :>
remember to use a lot of motor lock >:)
creations-chat 2023-01-19 09:14:11 I am really good at building landing gear, what bomber will you make? I can help you make it  (disclaimer, I will most likely use a lot of motor lock)
creations-chat 2023-01-19 09:16:15 B52 and a C-5? That's easy, let me build both of those aircraft for you right now in record time
creations-chat 2023-01-19 09:20:53 oh wow I just built most of a Lockheed Martin C-5M Super Galaxy in about 4 minutes!!!!!! 
Anyways here, I can show you the landing gear mechanism for it too
creations-chat 2023-01-19 09:27:34 and yes, I come ABSOLUTELY prepared for this one encounter to show landing gear of 2 largest military aircraft - because I have both aircrafts and videos

(first video I just made because I can, it's me showing the mechanism in spawn and launched)

(old video of the C5 gear during testing)

no suspension in any of these gears due to kraken sadly
creations-chat 2023-01-19 09:35:46 I got a 777 but the nose gear door is average - I got a 747 which works
but I cannot switch to that account currently - that B52 is on another account, I'm just lucky I saved videos of it
creations-chat 2023-01-19 12:19:14 yoooo niceee (try to hide the motor lock though, people will tell you off for it, ask me how i know ü´¢ )
