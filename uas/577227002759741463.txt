creations-chat 2022-09-25 02:44:54 I don't get why you guys are giving good builds so many down votes. Y'all are high on K-2 synthetic weed or smth -_-
creations-chat 2022-09-25 02:48:06 
creations-chat 2022-09-25 02:50:06 Wdym bruh? How tf am I "joking"? These are great builds. I honestly see nothing bad about them.
creations-chat 2022-09-25 02:52:17 Bruh- ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è how the hell is that plane bad? You better explain to me right now
creations-chat 2022-09-25 02:54:56 But why are they so high? I'm not saying I have a problem with it, it's just confusing as I've never seen standards that high before.
creations-chat 2022-09-25 02:57:09 I'm honestly scared to post my builds now...
creations-chat 2022-09-25 02:59:10 :c
creations-chat 2022-09-25 03:01:16 Oh screw  you dude. That's not true. Just because you're a white name doesn't mean you're stupid.
creations-chat 2022-09-25 03:05:06 That doesn't mean all are though. You said "whitenames are unable to do that." This kinda implies that you mean all white names are. At least think about putting "most" in front of it. ü§ì  (went ahead and put the nerd emoji so you guys don't have to)
creations-chat 2022-09-25 03:07:57 I just wanna know how your standards got higher than the Burj Khalifa bruh.
creations-chat 2022-09-25 03:11:20 Bro snitched on me :(
creations-chat 2022-09-25 03:13:44 I don't even get the point of blocking me. Bro doesn't even have an explanation for my so called stupidity.
creations-chat 2022-09-25 03:15:46 I'm there. Why don't you respond huh?
creations-chat 2022-09-25 03:17:49 Go to <#497142796961054721> 
<@849139320106516491> I've seen a six hour cool down once.

creations-chat 2023-03-03 23:13:32 Dude how about you quit being such a snobby little bitch? I'm doing my best, but I'm NOT a professional. To be honest it's turning out a little bit better than I expected. I'm sorry it's not up to YOUR standards, but it's the best I can do at the moment.

creations-chat 2023-06-19 05:30:00 RMS Olympic progress (as she was in 1925)
creations-chat 2023-06-19 06:29:50 "far from off" is that a good thing or a bad thing?"

creations-chat 2023-07-03 17:55:12 working on the F-15E Strike Eagle
creations-chat 2023-07-03 17:57:20 
creations-chat 2023-07-03 18:02:12 im gonna try to use more motorlock on this one. maybe even some angle lock if i can figure that one out
creations-chat 2023-07-03 18:06:19 yeah ill give that a try
creations-chat 2023-07-03 18:08:37 i've already added the joystick (i forgot the proper name) but im not exactly sure how i'll add the other details since the cockpit's a little small.
creations-chat 2023-07-04 12:39:32 canopy of my F-15E Strike Eagle is complete
creations-chat 2023-07-04 13:13:57 its a bit too complicated and i want the canopy to be able to open
creations-chat 2023-07-07 18:55:09 building omplec (RMS Olympic)
creations-chat 2023-07-07 18:58:19 thx. it's gonna take quite some time to build. hopefully i can enter this in for a boat contest once it's completed.
creations-chat 2023-07-07 19:00:22 let's hope it turns out as well as intended
creations-chat 2023-07-07 19:21:31

creations-chat 2023-07-07 23:38:08 better than most of my jets
creations-chat 2023-07-08 04:31:10 Just check creations. I posted my Sukhoi Su-33 there. It's got some mistakes which need fixing but other than that I consider it to be my best jet yet.
