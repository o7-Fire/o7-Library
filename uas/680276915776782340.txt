creations-chat 2020-08-01 02:54:38 i was going to say we can do a formation together but my only bomber is the B-52 stratofortress but that doesnâ€™t make sense xP
creations-chat 2020-08-01 03:09:20 you should post that in <#384025409945337856>, itâ€™s amazing!
creations-chat 2020-08-01 03:31:31 big problem
creations-chat 2020-08-01 03:31:43 i had that with my tank, it had a heavy turret
creations-chat 2020-08-01 07:35:24 local man dies on plane
creations-chat 2020-08-01 18:56:00 okay, noted
creations-chat 2020-08-01 20:10:30 i've come to realize how little wing panels were on the main wing
creations-chat 2020-08-01 23:27:14 hold on let me get on
creations-chat 2020-08-01 23:27:16 sorry
creations-chat 2020-08-01 23:32:58 <@!177743269105500160> here you go (sorry for ping)
creations-chat 2020-08-01 23:33:54 don't worry they are
creations-chat 2020-08-01 23:35:19 you mean like the leading tip?
creations-chat 2020-08-01 23:35:46 
creations-chat 2020-08-01 23:35:55 i know but i had too little room for it
creations-chat 2020-08-01 23:36:26 inside the wing has lots of motor locks and little free space to add more motors for the wing sadly
creations-chat 2020-08-01 23:36:28 thank you!
creations-chat 2020-08-01 23:37:09 sorry i can't make the horizontal stabilizers bigger
creations-chat 2020-08-01 23:37:54 the plane was heavily unbalanced, i had to sacrifice some horizontal stabilizer proportions to make the plane fly straight
creations-chat 2020-08-01 23:38:36 
creations-chat 2020-08-01 23:38:47 other than that i can make the engines longer and make the wing larger
creations-chat 2020-08-01 23:39:16 here's the wing
creations-chat 2020-08-01 23:39:35 
creations-chat 2020-08-01 23:39:41 but thank you for the feedback!
creations-chat 2020-08-01 23:40:30 ?
creations-chat 2020-08-02 00:08:53 improvements (to the left side only)
creations-chat 2020-08-02 00:09:11 wing looks too thick now so i actually have it angle it ;-;
creations-chat 2020-08-02 00:10:00 but i have no space
creations-chat 2020-08-02 00:10:21 i acn probably angle the front but not the back
creations-chat 2020-08-02 00:10:26 lots of motors are at the back
creations-chat 2020-08-02 00:37:19 is it worth it?
creations-chat 2020-08-02 00:37:45 alrighty then...
creations-chat 2020-08-02 00:52:04 i'm starting to not like the wing...
creations-chat 2020-08-02 00:52:44 
creations-chat 2020-08-02 00:52:50 blueprints are better for reference imo
creations-chat 2020-08-02 00:52:58 the wing is now a lot shorter too
creations-chat 2020-08-02 00:53:32 i agree
creations-chat 2020-08-02 01:01:40 krita works
creations-chat 2020-08-02 01:01:55 lmao
creations-chat 2020-08-02 01:02:02 donâ€™t believe so
creations-chat 2020-08-02 01:02:08 if youâ€™re talking about krita
creations-chat 2020-08-02 01:02:22 actually it doesnâ€™t exist on mobile
creations-chat 2020-08-02 01:03:46 lmao
creations-chat 2020-08-02 01:04:15 actually iâ€™ll do an overlay on my A-10 right now
creations-chat 2020-08-02 14:25:19 oh lord
creations-chat 2020-08-05 06:04:24 my ERJ-145 nose so far (WIP)
creations-chat 2020-08-05 19:20:47 motors are fun
creations-chat 2020-08-05 19:21:44 
creations-chat 2020-08-06 11:11:20 ERJ-145 so far
creations-chat 2020-08-06 11:11:48 not the CRJ family aircraft
creations-chat 2020-08-06 11:11:59 Embraer ERJ-145
creations-chat 2020-08-06 11:12:23 itâ€™s fine
creations-chat 2020-08-06 11:12:57 for reference
creations-chat 2020-08-06 17:19:14 when you realize your plane is too short
creations-chat 2020-08-06 17:19:52 yeah ;-;
creations-chat 2020-08-06 17:20:31 although i'm proud of the windshield
creations-chat 2020-08-06 17:48:13 shortened the nose but it's still far too long ;-;
creations-chat 2020-08-07 06:19:03 ERJ-145 so far
creations-chat 2020-08-07 07:26:21 ? of the ERJ-145?
creations-chat 2020-08-07 07:28:23 
creations-chat 2020-08-07 07:28:54 thanks
creations-chat 2020-08-07 09:05:25 should i make a custom engine instead?
creations-chat 2020-08-07 17:11:33 maybe, maybe not
creations-chat 2020-08-07 17:12:03 i canâ€™t judge because iâ€™m generally bad
creations-chat 2020-08-07 17:28:46 which engine design should i use for my ERJ-145?
creations-chat 2020-08-07 17:42:59 **they both suck T-T**
creations-chat 2020-08-07 17:44:51 for which engine?
creations-chat 2020-08-07 17:45:16 (reference)
creations-chat 2020-08-07 17:45:37 yeah]
creations-chat 2020-08-07 17:46:12 i tried to build around a 2x2 engine, but it didn't come out as planned
creations-chat 2020-08-07 17:46:52 yeah, seems too small
creations-chat 2020-08-07 17:47:21 thank you!
creations-chat 2020-08-07 17:47:35 i did
creations-chat 2020-08-07 17:47:56 but i think i need to motor lock it more, as the side of the aircraft is half blocks (that's why i motor locked)
creations-chat 2020-08-07 17:50:49 i did a bit more
creations-chat 2020-08-07 17:52:51 i think it looks good (thank you guys)
creations-chat 2020-08-07 17:53:02 
creations-chat 2020-08-07 17:55:20 what livery should i paint for the ERJ-145?
creations-chat 2020-08-07 17:58:56 you should, small aircraft like regional airliners and private jets are fun to make
creations-chat 2020-08-07 17:59:55 i mean, my ERJ-145 is a blast to make
creations-chat 2020-08-07 18:00:15 nah i think you should make the lear jet
creations-chat 2020-08-07 18:00:29 imo U-2s aren't that interesting
creations-chat 2020-08-07 18:00:33 (to make)
creations-chat 2020-08-07 18:04:43 the ERJ-145 for me was pretty complex, youâ€™ll make it
creations-chat 2020-08-07 18:15:41 we all do, yet we canâ€™t even finish a cessna (me at least)
creations-chat 2020-08-07 18:19:03 unexpected
creations-chat 2020-08-07 18:19:16 okay, thank you
creations-chat 2020-08-07 18:53:08 armata?
creations-chat 2020-08-07 18:53:29 this the one?
creations-chat 2020-08-07 18:54:10 i want to say it's not as detailed as i thought you meant but i can't say that as i can never build a tank

creations-chat 2020-08-22 02:32:34 > I donâ€™t like the bf-109 that was posted in <#384025409945337856>

bot-central 2020-08-29 16:11:02 $nee
creations-chat 2020-08-31 03:17:21 i've been robbed of my machine gun
creations-chat 2020-08-31 03:18:22 i was in a server with him, and i was teaching dragon platinum how to motor lock with it out...
creations-chat 2020-08-31 03:19:26 no it's fine, i talked to him about it in dragonplatinum's server
creations-chat 2020-08-31 03:19:55 although i'll just
creations-chat 2020-08-31 03:20:04 <@!268862168877760512> ;>
creations-chat 2020-08-31 03:22:02 let me improve mine first xP
creations-chat 2020-08-31 03:22:52 oh, we were in the dragonplatinum discord server
creations-chat 2020-08-31 03:23:10 it's a level role xP
creations-chat 2020-08-31 03:23:17 get it at level 20
creations-chat 2020-08-31 03:24:12 yup
creations-chat 2020-08-31 03:24:29 nothing competitive there, just a discord server for the man to talk to others
creations-chat 2020-08-31 03:25:02 sounds interesting
creations-chat 2020-08-31 03:25:04 hmm...
creations-chat 2020-08-31 03:25:08 water bottle
creations-chat 2020-08-31 03:32:23 i tried adding heating vents, you can't even see them
creations-chat 2020-09-03 23:23:07 hm
creations-chat 2020-09-03 23:35:16 oh noz
creations-chat 2020-09-27 17:18:12 tyty
creations-chat 2020-09-27 17:18:28 nobody talk about the paint clipping xD
creations-chat 2020-09-27 17:18:48 > I like it, however, it is somewhat off proportions, here is a blueprint
nah man i hate the wings with a passion
creations-chat 2020-09-27 17:19:22 i canâ€™t angle the wings without having exposed motors, so i left it straight
creations-chat 2020-09-27 17:19:57 sure
creations-chat 2020-09-27 17:20:23 also i know the canopy is too small but we donâ€™t talk about that
creations-chat 2020-09-27 17:20:58 
creations-chat 2020-09-27 17:21:15 
creations-chat 2020-09-27 17:21:40 ouch the engines hurt already
creations-chat 2020-09-27 17:22:06 > but damn thats a nice a10
coming from an admin i uh...
i feel proud
creations-chat 2020-09-27 17:23:16 it says the plane flies at 500 speed but in reality it only flies at around 200
creations-chat 2020-09-27 17:23:43 yeah, my fps drops to 11 from spawning it in
creations-chat 2020-09-27 17:24:00 block count?
creations-chat 2020-09-27 17:24:17 1540 blocks
creations-chat 2020-09-27 17:24:52 it's not the most complex motor locking ever but here
creations-chat 2020-09-27 17:25:13 *wha*
creations-chat 2020-09-27 17:26:10 > Why doesn't anyone use hover engines
hover drives glitch out and lag you way too much if it's clipped with something
creations-chat 2020-09-27 17:26:41 my fps went from 11 to 6 if i used hover drives
creations-chat 2020-09-27 17:27:00 that's a pretty good A-10 for a mini build ðŸ‘€
creations-chat 2020-09-27 17:28:37 non motor lock builds are best for them
creations-chat 2020-09-27 17:28:53 if a block clips the hover engines, the lag is insane
creations-chat 2020-09-27 17:29:36 *oh*
creations-chat 2020-09-27 17:30:33 i think the wobbling part is due to your vertical stabilizer size
creations-chat 2020-09-27 17:31:05 yup sadly
creations-chat 2020-09-27 17:32:04 oh, acceleration speed doesn't really matter to me so that's good
creations-chat 2020-09-27 17:34:59 oh i can already see how slow the acceleration is
creations-chat 2020-09-27 17:47:51 > here is how my hover thruster planes usually fly
the way you did the horizontal stabilizers is pretty smart, good F-4 too
creations-chat 2020-09-27 17:49:45 *how does your F-4 even bank*
creations-chat 2020-09-27 17:50:00 i'm honestly confused
creations-chat 2020-09-27 17:51:26 planes are enough...
creations-chat 2020-09-27 17:51:56 that F-4 by DrMrBones could very well be a shredder bug killing machine
creations-chat 2020-09-27 17:53:17 > my mig 21 is even better than my phantom
me: *struggles to even kill those noob builds*
creations-chat 2020-09-27 17:53:47 box with weapons and wheels
creations-chat 2020-09-27 17:56:31 *i don't have fireworks T-T*
creations-chat 2020-09-27 17:57:08 and i like the size of motors, smaller than 1x1 but bigger than a trail or something
creations-chat 2020-09-27 17:57:56 *nah my A-10 is too wack to be used in pvp*
creations-chat 2020-09-27 17:58:27 slap some guns on the starter plane and you'll still be able to kill me
creations-chat 2020-09-27 18:00:03 *tf*
creations-chat 2020-09-27 18:00:47 i seriously need help on how to make a pvp plane
bot-central 2020-09-27 18:07:43 !servers
creations-chat 2020-09-27 18:54:34 > can i get some feedback on this random carrier
paintjob can be worked on, other than that itâ€™s awesome
creations-chat 2020-09-27 19:08:55 for what?
creations-chat 2020-09-27 19:09:11 *non too small*
creations-chat 2020-09-28 01:00:12 > Why are alot of the "experts" so rude about stuff that isnt a 1 to 1 thing
1:1 scale is uh... it's kinda hard to explain
creations-chat 2020-09-28 01:00:53 uh, when you build stuff that isn't 1:1 scale but is possible, it's sort of cowardly i guess, same thing with building something oversized
creations-chat 2020-09-28 01:01:38 although builds that are aimed to be mini/smaller than usual is an expectation
creations-chat 2020-09-28 02:17:09 VTOL A-10 (my old A-10)
creations-chat 2020-09-28 02:17:41 i don't know why i thought of that, don't ask xP
creations-chat 2020-09-28 02:18:11 **i don't know how it even works**
creations-chat 2020-09-28 02:24:23 converting my new A-10 to have VTOL is harder than i thought
creations-chat 2020-09-28 02:24:58 *because it's stupid*
creations-chat 2020-09-28 02:26:13 > You tryin to be funny and post shitpost
> But you just made yourself looking like a literal idiotic autistic banana skin
canâ€™t tell if thatâ€™s to me ;-;
creations-chat 2020-09-28 02:26:31 phew
creations-chat 2020-09-28 02:27:11 VTOL A-10 <:Thonk:509498568982134816>
creations-chat 2020-09-28 02:27:55 > hypersonic A10 <:PogStare:699130318510227537>
*another idea*
creations-chat 2020-09-28 02:28:17 i donâ€™t care, *delta wing A-10*
creations-chat 2020-09-28 02:31:52 so much beef
creations-chat 2020-09-28 02:33:10 *just use the damn crop tool*
creations-chat 2020-09-28 02:34:06 > do you use Windows key shift S?
this is how you use the crop tool btw
creations-chat 2020-09-28 02:34:36 > what tank should i build
uhh...
creations-chat 2020-09-28 03:52:53 **bruh it's been like 7 hours**
creations-chat 2020-09-28 03:53:20 well you see, there's something called motor lock
creations-chat 2020-09-28 03:54:01 *maybe try to reverse engineer that yourself*
creations-chat 2020-09-28 03:55:17 **no why would you post a tutorial build**
creations-chat 2020-09-28 03:55:36 hella bad, *it's a tutorial*
help 2020-09-30 02:16:26 looks like i donâ€™t have to explain anything
creations-chat 2020-09-30 05:30:55 oh lord
creations-chat 2020-09-30 05:36:18 > what are jets even good for in this game?
awesomeness, pvp, just fun
creations-chat 2020-09-30 05:36:35 formations, aerial refuelling, airshows
creations-chat 2020-10-01 01:09:01 when you built the thing carrying the GAU-8 but not the GAU-8 itself
creations-chat 2020-10-01 01:09:22 *time to work*
creations-chat 2020-10-02 04:01:14 i was already making my GAU-8 beside my A-10 xP
creations-chat 2020-10-02 04:01:29 which might be a bit oversized ;-;
creations-chat 2020-10-02 04:39:21 unless it's an exception, i will never make anything larger than 1:1 scale
creations-chat 2020-10-03 03:19:01 > 13 -14 fps not bad even if its lag just chilll
here i am with 9 fps *on a plane*
creations-chat 2020-10-03 23:04:29 that filter offsetted my eyes majorly
creations-chat 2020-10-04 04:24:15 just wanted to build something for fun, D3A VAL

creations-chat 2020-10-09 04:27:38 just a few updates to the A-10 (canopy is still wip)
creations-chat 2020-10-09 21:17:38 > WHAT FUCKING BLOCK FITS IN THIS CORNER ITS QUARTER WEDGE
none, the only other way is to motor lock a triangle wedge in there
creations-chat 2020-10-10 04:09:02 btw the F-111 is a variable wing aircraft
creations-chat 2020-10-10 16:41:46 so... i lost my A-10

creations-chat 2020-10-16 01:32:46 you should ask yourself after looking at a blueprint

creations-chat 2020-10-17 21:06:23 just a fun small F-14 build
creations-chat 2020-10-17 21:10:05 itâ€™s only the motor for the sweep wing okay ;-;
creations-chat 2020-10-17 21:13:25 last time i worked with camera welding, the build became too complex
creations-chat 2020-10-17 21:14:47 oh thanks, gotta say that canopy is much better than my whacky A-10 though
creations-chat 2020-10-17 21:16:37 same, iâ€™ve been losing motivation to make stuff
creations-chat 2020-10-17 21:17:45 although the F-14 was a build for a group so thatâ€™s why i could finish it lmao
if it was a personal build then iâ€™ll never finish it
creations-chat 2020-10-17 21:19:07 *buccaneer*

damn that plane was on my list of planes to make
gotta up my game then
creations-chat 2020-10-17 21:20:28 yeah, i wanted a naval plane to build and the buccaneer was perfect
underrated af too
creations-chat 2020-10-17 21:21:34 motor lock will do the job
creations-chat 2020-10-17 21:22:57 > I kinda want to build this next, i haven't built a ship in a long while       and yes, motor lock is the answer to almost anything
i suck so much at ships, also iâ€™ll never finish them seeing how lazy i am lmao

i canâ€™t even build a speed boat
creations-chat 2020-10-17 21:25:07 > Boats can be a pain in the arse sometimes
i can't even make a decent smooth hull

lmao

once in a while i try to build a big project, but i just drop them instantly like my B-52, B-17 and P-8
creations-chat 2020-10-17 21:28:24 F-5 tiger

i'm so lazy that i can't even finish a trainer
creations-chat 2020-10-17 21:34:11 only ship i made was this shitty carrier that's not even done (don't ask why there's a purple line)
creations-chat 2020-10-17 21:42:47 > <@!680276915776782340> Can I see the bow of the carrier? Im just curious.
very shitty hull, i think i was trying to make the hull bigger but i have up lmao
creations-chat 2020-10-17 21:43:49 extremely flat and ugly, i donâ€™t even know what i was trying to do back then lmfao
creations-chat 2020-10-17 21:45:23 nay it was never nice, if you actually looked at it, itâ€™s disgusting

only good ish thing about it was itâ€™s size, bigger than most 1-2 fold carriers
creations-chat 2020-10-17 21:46:48 it has room for a 4th fold, but iâ€™d rather build a new one
creations-chat 2020-10-24 20:03:30 trapdoors on mobile is pain
creations-chat 2020-10-24 20:09:54 master rank maybe (cause of 4000 block count)
creations-chat 2020-10-24 22:13:59 fun for the A-10
creations-chat 2020-10-24 22:17:05 2 more blocks lmao
creations-chat 2020-10-24 22:18:28 oh different requirements sorry
creations-chat 2020-10-24 22:19:30 got mixed up with aeronautical and shipwright
creations-chat 2020-10-27 05:08:30 opinions about the new canopy?
creations-chat 2020-10-27 05:11:52 > just fix the wings themselves cause those angles are OFF AS FUCK
the dihedral wing?
if it is then i can't really do much about that cause i can't eyeball the angle perfectly
creations-chat 2020-10-27 05:13:14 motor 2 is screwed the moment something welds with it ;-;
creations-chat 2020-10-27 05:14:17 my limiter is kinda trach because i'm limited to wing panels and i can't really eyeball the thing Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯
creations-chat 2020-10-27 05:15:49 > and i can't really eyeball the thing
ya'll don't even remember me ;-;
creations-chat 2020-10-27 05:18:06 
creations-chat 2020-10-27 05:19:08 if we're talking about this angle then never
creations-chat 2020-10-27 05:20:08 i've come to realize fighter jet fuselages are 2 blocks wide, well i ain't restarting too
hardpoints become useless if it's side by side and there will be exposed motors trying to have a 0.5 space between
creations-chat 2020-10-27 05:23:51 making the A-10's wings angled is like begging to have exposed motors on the plane
creations-chat 2020-10-27 05:24:52 uh no camera welding is hard to implement has there's strict rules to not make it big
the A-10's wings doesn't start angled, same thing with the dihedral wing
creations-chat 2020-10-27 05:28:54 all i came for were canopy opinions and got blasted by something that needs a whole redesign of the A-10 + a lot of motor locking
creations-chat 2020-10-27 05:29:55 try to make the A-10 wing :D
creations-chat 2020-10-27 05:30:57 *thatâ€™s the thing*
sure it is possible but by then itâ€™ll become like 4000 blocks and my laptop canâ€™t handle it
all for a wing angle
creations-chat 2020-10-27 05:35:11 step 0: make it yourself first before talking about it
creations-chat 2020-10-27 05:37:05 forget it, i donâ€™t want to go into another argument
creations-chat 2020-10-27 05:38:06 if you want yourself, but not actually forcing you to
creations-chat 2020-10-27 05:39:39 my A-10â€™s oversized so uh... not sure
creations-chat 2020-10-27 05:41:01 25 long, 5 wide
if you get what i mean by 5 wide
nvm 5 wide
creations-chat 2020-10-27 05:42:06 wing thickness is 1 block
same
creations-chat 2020-10-27 05:44:40 i canâ€™t really implement camera welding cause my builds structures are not fit for it
creations-chat 2020-10-27 05:45:42 the time i used them, just a few changes with the plane itself made the cameras go berserk
creations-chat 2020-10-27 05:47:24 everything has to be designed around the cameras if you decide to use them
creations-chat 2020-10-27 05:48:30 thatâ€™s the thing

also another reason why they canâ€™t be used much, the pilot seat matters way too much
creations-chat 2020-10-27 05:51:51 the bottom of the wing is going to look so ugly
creations-chat 2020-10-27 05:53:03 ouch gotta redesign the ailerons and airbrakes ;-;

A-10 has split ailerons, aka itâ€™s airbrakes
creations-chat 2020-10-27 05:54:51 gotta wait for the painful CD
creations-chat 2020-10-27 05:56:01 if i don't add them i'll die
creations-chat 2020-10-27 05:58:01 > ok so you want :
Airbrakes
Wing shape
Tilted tips
Ailerons
and Flaps?
i want none cause i donâ€™t want to drag you into this

i think i've spent more than a month on the A-10, and the thing's still WIP
creations-chat 2020-10-27 06:01:35 i have exams tomorrow but i don't even care, time to make those wings
creations-chat 2020-11-01 22:37:20 the gang got together
creations-chat 2020-11-01 22:38:38 except the drone
creations-chat 2020-11-01 22:40:16 i took the picture in the A-10 so not the best angle

we were filming stuff and couldnâ€™t get rid of the drone

slowmode is there so shit donâ€™t go down
creations-chat 2020-11-03 22:25:12 creations feedback lmao
creations-chat 2020-11-03 22:42:03 > arold i finished the wings but i dont think they were that good
I mean it flew but was shite
about that, A-10 went into the trash

making a new and more 1:1 scale one
creations-chat 2020-11-03 22:44:42 more like i stopped working on it, i could never throw it into the trash

SF1000?
creations-chat 2020-11-18 02:55:04 at least youâ€™re doing it right

unlike 90% of all formula 1 builders


ah yes brawn gp
creations-chat 2020-11-18 02:57:45 double diffuser is not the most important

itâ€™s in the back, where most players donâ€™t see/know about

iâ€™d say use disconnectors and signs more, also motor lock if you know how to use it

nose is a bit weird, also fix it to add the front tyres

engine intakes slopes down too early and hard, make it more smooth
creations-chat 2020-11-18 03:00:48 rear wing is okay i guess

god that is painful
creations-chat 2020-11-22 23:52:33 is that a buccaneer btw?
creations-chat 2020-11-22 23:54:05 holy fuck that is **hot**

half of my brain is tell me that is a bit big but itâ€™s actually 1:1

oh no i gotta up my game
creations-chat 2020-11-22 23:55:56 (imo) one of the hardest fighter/attackers to build

A-6 family
creations-chat 2020-11-22 23:57:51 tbh the EA-6B is easier to both build and get the opening canopy haha

too scared to make the sliding canopy and big nose

btw i think you should do the camo because the other paintjobs donâ€™t feel that good on buccaneer

god iâ€™m on mobile so i donâ€™t even know the cd
creations-chat 2020-11-22 23:59:24 yeah
super etendard also *hot*
youâ€™re godamn right rhcp

sorry, i suck at making propeller fighters
creations-chat 2020-11-23 00:02:34 sometimes i love how wing panels are thicker than blocks, and sometimes i hate how itâ€™s like that
by that i mean if you lock it in, it still sticks out
creations-chat 2020-11-23 00:04:08 ewr yj 101
creations-chat 2020-11-23 00:07:29 > too generic, and it would end up being pretty shite anyway like most of my builds
the ewr yj?
creations-chat 2020-11-23 04:21:47 use a half wedge down
idk the name of it but similar to the half triangle wedge
actually i donâ€™t even know whatâ€™s going on in the picture
creations-chat 2020-11-23 04:23:56 so the angled delta is half a block in?


itâ€™s a dumb idea but
creations-chat 2020-11-23 04:26:02 a delta angled here or something

ah shit nvm itâ€™s not gonna fit
creations-chat 2020-11-23 04:27:41 i donâ€™t think i can help you

i canâ€™t even start the intruder nose
creations-chat 2020-11-23 04:30:17 i canâ€™t handle how sexy that buccaneer is

i take it the probeâ€™s angling is the only one where you have to eyeball it?
creations-chat 2020-11-23 04:31:54 indeed, one of the best fighters iâ€™ve ever seen

or planes similar of class/size

nowdays itâ€™s either i somehow have a self limiter or i eyeball it

i agree with whatâ€™s said below me
creations-chat 2020-11-23 05:02:37 > i started on the wings, but i think i'm gonna get some sleep before i continue on that pain

creations-chat 2021-01-27 15:13:23 better than the raptor itself iâ€™d agree, but i think iâ€™d like a squadron instead, VF-2 or VF-103
F-24 was the concept name, canâ€™t do anything about that
creations-chat 2021-01-28 22:10:52 his most, not as much as some of us do
creations-chat 2021-01-31 04:05:11 the b52 has a anhedral wing, in flight it just straightens out a bit

itâ€™s clear when the b-52 is on the ground
creations-chat 2021-01-31 04:09:47 tilts downwards
creations-chat 2021-01-31 04:58:42 the wing placement is simply just advantages of maintenance, engine clearance, fuselage design, etc

the wing tilt usually offers stability and such

a straight wing doesnâ€™t mean itâ€™s easier to snap off, that depends on the wing design and materials
creations-chat 2021-01-31 05:16:03 ge9x is as big as a 737 fuselage...

creations-chat 2021-02-01 18:23:23 curved wing?
creations-chat 2021-02-04 22:59:06 based on the design, probably a viper
creations-chat 2021-02-05 00:15:19 > No?
> Doesnt look like a Viper
> At all
small leading edge extension, single engine, cropped delta wing, etc
it has the characteristics of a viper, intakes aside
creations-chat 2021-02-05 03:11:33 you canâ€™t hide motor lock on anhedral/dihedral wings, unless itâ€™s rotated at the centre, which isnâ€™t ideal
creations-chat 2021-02-05 05:28:36 > make a lip on the front and add some decor so it doesnt look like a flat brick
he could be trying to make a ship with a stealthy design, flat and smooth surfaces to reduce cross section
creations-chat 2021-02-07 04:24:44 improve intake, delta wing leading edge and trailing edge, aft canopy, tail, diverterless supersonic inlets, canards, 1 block wide canopy
creations-chat 2021-02-07 05:51:57 his intakes are somewhat accurate, since you're probably looking at the J-10A, which was not what he aimed for
creations-chat 2021-02-11 05:23:15 dc-10 has 5 or so, 737NGs have 170
creations-chat 2021-02-11 05:25:34 okay 737 classic then
pretty sure the NGs had more though
creations-chat 2021-02-11 05:30:04 barely any was designed related issues, most was maintenance and pilot error

could be much lower

max crashes were avoidable, pilots werenâ€™t trained with the mcas anyways

bug-reports 2021-05-08 13:34:39 this has been happening for 7 months
bug-reports 2021-05-08 15:49:54 the launch delay is around 5 seconds, and itâ€™s still launched from where I touched the keybind, but Iâ€™d be a few thousand thuds away from then
bug-reports 2021-05-08 16:38:28 I can play any fps plane fine, so itâ€™s not lag
bug-reports 2021-05-08 16:38:38 my ping doesnâ€™t reach 1k either

bug-reports 2021-05-15 01:00:51 nobody seems to know how to the problem
bug-reports 2021-05-15 17:11:25 they override everything
bug-reports 2021-05-15 17:11:33 anchored or unanchored
bug-reports 2021-05-15 17:14:17 whatever you did with the camera
bug-reports 2021-05-15 17:14:42 clearly itâ€™s doing something wrong
bug-reports 2021-05-15 17:15:00 itâ€™s not about motors
bug-reports 2021-05-15 17:15:16 configure the camera wrong, your build breaks
bug-reports 2021-05-15 17:15:21 they do
bug-reports 2021-05-15 17:16:35 test it yourself then
