the-dump 2020-12-03 12:25:52 its a no barrel shotgun
creations-chat 2022-11-20 00:37:33 what are we supposed to compare it with
iranian kamikaze drones?
flankers are still gonna suck ass
creations-chat 2022-11-20 00:40:06 the rafale has a better radar cross section than the su57 lmaooooo, is a safer plane and isnt built like garbage (also has sidewinders)
creations-chat 2022-11-20 00:42:14 yet they are still are much better developed (france or sweden for example)
creations-chat 2022-11-20 00:44:20 flankers suck, the su35 still has soviet era technology <3
creations-chat 2022-11-20 00:46:50 dassault rafale D, C and M, gripen (although i heard some bad stuff about it from someone who actually has a contract with saab and is working on one)
reply to 2 messages below: they are just as capable lmao
creations-chat 2022-11-20 00:49:23 check out how the latest russia su35s are getting wrecked by ukrainian mig 29s and then we will be talking
creations-chat 2022-11-20 00:51:35 mig29s are still flankers, just a bit upgraded
im comparing how developed russia is to 50 years ago when the mig 29 first flew
creations-chat 2022-11-20 00:53:37 its airframe is 90% based off the flanker family, thus its objectively a flanker
creations-chat 2022-11-20 00:56:13 tell me a difference between the su27 and su35 other than avionics (addressing your point)
the su35 is slower and heavier, but has thrust vectoring, worse rate of climb and service ceiling
creations-chat 2022-11-20 01:06:04 im telling you that its not just the lack of training that matters ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
