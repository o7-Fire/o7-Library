help 2018-09-18 07:49:21 but if its ingame
help 2018-09-18 07:49:34 use motors attached to the back of the wings
help 2018-09-18 07:49:46 like where your control surfaces are normally placed
help 2018-09-18 07:50:05 only 1 motor required per wing
help 2018-09-18 07:50:57 and just make sure that only the motor is connecting the folding piece of the wings and the part of the wing attached to the fuselage
help 2018-09-18 07:51:21 ive done folding wings before
help 2018-09-18 07:51:37 but only on a 747 that couldnt fly because it had about 2k blocks or so
help 2018-09-22 17:33:26 save and reload 3240235925 times <@!217336009455566848>
help 2018-09-22 17:46:06 well add or remove a block
help 2018-09-22 17:46:14 and then save and reload 2035026 times
help 2018-09-25 22:06:56 you learn by yourself
help 2018-09-25 22:06:57 thats how
help 2018-09-25 22:06:58 ecks dee
the-dump 2018-09-30 18:30:25 yeah i kinda like it
the-dump 2018-09-30 18:31:13 i love pineapples in general though
the-dump 2018-09-30 18:31:41 in france they had so many restaurants that let you buy pineapple juice lol
the-dump 2018-09-30 18:31:51 very refreshing
help 2018-09-30 18:36:56 to be honest i think its mostly the same person
help 2018-09-30 18:37:06 that causes the bugged plots
help 2018-09-30 18:38:39 i think its amtrak
help 2018-09-30 18:45:31 yeah the block limit should  be removed tbh
help 2018-09-30 18:46:04 like i made a lunar rover once but it was on,y 30 blocks
help 2018-09-30 18:46:15 it had less gravity too
help 2018-09-30 18:47:08 ok well if its inventive enough the block limit can be ignored correct?
help 2018-09-30 18:48:22 also how would a low effort build get inventor since youd have to spend a lot of time just thinking about what to make, how to make it etc. since nobody has ever built it before
help 2018-09-30 18:50:03 oh christ ok
help 2018-09-30 18:50:26 yeah put it in <#384025409945337856>

bug-reports 2018-10-07 17:50:43 all the buttons dont let you place items or delete them when you click em
bug-reports 2018-10-07 17:51:16 if you are placing or deleting blocks when saving, and you click the scroll bar, it places or deletes blocks that were behind it

help 2018-10-08 00:45:48 what how
help 2018-10-08 00:45:55 what kind of ai would that be
help 2018-10-08 00:46:14 you cant make an ai out of magnets.
help 2018-10-08 00:46:58 you can, however, make many basic components that would be a part of a computer
help 2018-10-08 00:47:22 you could make different kinds of gates, because magnets have only 2 charges
bug-reports 2018-10-08 03:43:28 what?
bug-reports 2018-10-08 03:44:12 which propellors
bug-reports 2018-10-08 03:44:25 engines or blades
bug-reports 2018-10-08 03:44:43 are you sure they stop functioning
bug-reports 2018-10-08 03:45:19 the rocket staging doesnt have anything to do with propellors not working
bug-reports 2018-10-08 03:45:24 do you use
bug-reports 2018-10-08 03:45:28 a disconnector?
bug-reports 2018-10-08 03:45:48 are both keys the same?
bug-reports 2018-10-08 03:46:54 i dont know how to fix this without pictures or shit
bug-reports 2018-10-08 03:47:03 can you just send a picture it would be 1000x easier
bug-reports 2018-10-08 03:47:20 gifs or video
bug-reports 2018-10-08 03:47:56 uhh
bug-reports 2018-10-08 03:48:17 then why are you reporting this bug
bug-reports 2018-10-08 03:48:59 yes but at least give us some evidence when you report the bug
bug-reports 2018-10-08 03:49:06 so that it can be fixed immediately
bug-reports 2018-10-08 03:49:28 instead of dragging on a conversation and just saying you can't get video or pictures
bug-reports 2018-10-08 03:49:39 when they expect you to give some
bug-reports 2018-10-08 03:50:29 yes but you need more than a bit to say you encountered a bug for us to fix
bug-reports 2018-10-08 04:31:43 provide video or gif then
the-dump 2018-10-08 04:33:48 only funny part about this is their username
help 2018-10-10 01:50:06 like, ingame?
help 2018-10-10 01:50:22 well not me i guess
help 2018-10-10 01:55:15 i mean i just stopped working on it
help 2018-10-10 01:55:22 because i ran out of time to use pc
help 2018-10-10 01:55:34 if i was still working on it i wouldnt have gone on the discord
help 2018-10-10 01:55:56 cause i dont usually stay on discord for too long when i could rather be playing plane crazy
help 2018-10-10 01:59:21 since i dont think anyone has created a bolt action mechanism while having spring fed bullets, if anyone builds one before me im still getting the inventor rank ok
help 2018-10-10 02:01:42 oof
help 2018-10-10 02:03:23 but how would you fire the rounds?
help 2018-10-10 02:12:17 hm ok
help 2018-10-10 02:12:39 yeah but my gun is spring fed
help 2018-10-10 02:14:04 mk
help 2018-10-10 06:41:52 . . . - - - . . .
help 2018-10-10 06:42:06 ... --- ...
bug-reports 2018-10-10 06:46:02 like 2 days ago, why?
help 2018-10-10 22:38:45 uhh
help 2018-10-10 22:38:53 i would not recommend pistons for doors
help 2018-10-10 22:39:01 motors are less glitchy
help 2018-10-10 22:39:22 and you need more pistons to push more than 1.5 blocks
help 2018-10-10 22:39:41 use motors like they are hinges
help 2018-10-10 22:41:03 attach the darker side to the frame of the door
help 2018-10-10 22:41:20 and the lighter side should be pointing either upwards or downwards
help 2018-10-10 22:41:44 darker side should only touch the frame by its sides,
help 2018-10-10 22:42:04 not having the full 1x1 dark part touching it
help 2018-10-10 22:42:16 this is harder to tell you without pictures
help 2018-10-10 22:46:07 yes, now make sure there is a block next to that motor which will connect the motor to the frame
help 2018-10-10 22:46:18 and make sure the door doesn't connect with the frame
help 2018-10-10 22:46:28 so i would suggest using wedges and corner wedges
help 2018-10-10 22:47:07 like, using the angled side of a wedge facing towards the door in order to make the door not connect with the door frame and thus not allowing the door to work at all
help 2018-10-11 04:17:47 toby
help 2018-10-11 04:17:54 imagine it like it's a scale
help 2018-10-11 04:18:11 if both balls are too far apart, it'll be impossible to fly
help 2018-10-11 04:18:27 actually no that's not the right metaphor
help 2018-10-11 04:18:46 but what i mean is, if both balls are too far apart, there's no chance it will fly
help 2018-10-11 04:19:06 if your center of mass is up front, and your center of lift is behind it, then the nose will drop
help 2018-10-11 04:19:29 if the mass is at the back, the plane will be back heavy, and it will go up when you aren't using your control surfaces
help 2018-10-11 04:19:40 as in when it's cruising in the air
help 2018-10-11 04:19:55 if your center of mass and lift are close enough together, your plane will fly
help 2018-10-11 04:20:33 but just make sure that wherever those two meet, it's closer to the middle of the plane rather than the front or back, which will compromise its flying effectiveness a lot
help 2018-10-11 04:21:08 so you either need to put more wings closer to the front, or more weight at the back/less weight at the front
the-dump 2018-10-11 06:35:11 properties?
the-dump 2018-10-11 06:35:15 as in weight?
the-dump 2018-10-11 06:35:36 if you change the material of an object, it just changes the texture, nothing else
the-dump 2018-10-11 06:35:50 if you want it to weigh differently then it has to be manual
the-dump 2018-10-11 07:24:22 i think i remember being on that page a little bit
help 2018-10-11 23:36:35 yo, anyone here that plays robocraft?
help 2018-10-11 23:36:47 im starting to play it again and i havent played for years
help 2018-10-11 23:39:07 its been p2w for years
help 2018-10-11 23:39:11 i dont care honestly
bug-reports 2018-10-12 00:38:56 if you keep holding down the button that causes ropes to lengthen, the ropes keep getting longer
bug-reports 2018-10-12 00:39:57 yes i think so

help 2018-10-18 02:35:30 we were trustworthy enough to attain moderator rank in the eyes of xpert
help 2018-10-18 02:36:06 why not give a copy to moderators that have experience in developing in roblox studio?
help 2018-10-18 18:56:29 i know that

help 2018-10-18 18:58:12 and as i said before, moderators are already trusted

help 2018-10-18 18:59:00 well he does enough to add updates from a person on this discord server

help 2018-10-18 19:03:02 i was talking about rick the entire time
help 2018-10-18 19:03:22 dunno why you would think xpert was the one that made all the updates lol
help 2018-10-18 19:05:40 yes of course
help 2018-10-18 19:06:51 no im saying that mad trusts people from this discord enough to add updates made from rickj
help 2018-10-18 19:08:26 he got a copy of the game when it was uncopylocked for a day
help 2018-10-18 19:08:54 mad provided it when rick made good updates
help 2018-10-18 19:09:01 or mad gave access to full game
help 2018-10-18 19:09:03 recently
help 2018-10-18 19:10:59 no
help 2018-10-18 19:11:05 cant be from updates

help 2018-10-18 19:13:23 there were usually around 5 - 10 concurrent players in the afternoon
help 2018-10-18 19:13:28 before this all happened
help 2018-10-18 19:13:46 getting over 10 was an achievement
help 2018-10-18 19:13:50 100 even more so
help 2018-10-18 19:14:18 well you'll just have to confirm in person
help 2018-10-18 19:14:29 im sure all mods are veterans though
help 2018-10-18 19:15:22 really, the only good proof you have is to have a join date of at least a year before this happened

creations-chat 2018-10-24 05:17:13 im not on anyone's side
creations-chat 2018-10-24 05:17:34 but im usually trying to look at it from a different perspective if someone's very angry
creations-chat 2018-10-24 05:17:47 because something had to cause you to be aggressive and angry
creations-chat 2018-10-24 05:17:59 but sometimes i just think you get angered easily

creations-chat 2018-11-12 06:43:58 the hull
creations-chat 2018-11-12 06:44:36 oh thats definitely enough
creations-chat 2018-11-12 06:44:41 way more than enough
creations-chat 2018-11-12 06:44:53 i had thought it was 5
creations-chat 2018-11-12 06:45:17 oof
creations-chat 2018-11-12 06:45:31 so it was an even amount of blocks wide?
creations-chat 2018-11-12 06:45:50 k
creations-chat 2018-11-12 06:47:16 oofd
creations-chat 2018-11-12 06:47:24 i dont get stressed out
creations-chat 2018-11-12 06:48:01 i only stop working on something once i realize it's gonna take wayy too long to make or its gonna need all of my creativity and ingenuity to make it look good/function well
creations-chat 2018-11-12 06:48:23 most are curved im pretty sure
creations-chat 2018-11-12 06:49:34 hard to make/understand for beginners tho
creations-chat 2018-11-12 06:49:53 i suggest a quad engined configuration for a beginner vtol
creations-chat 2018-11-12 06:50:04 as in 4 engines in the corners
creations-chat 2018-11-12 06:50:12 instead of 2 engines in the middle
creations-chat 2018-11-12 06:50:30 those are the hardest since motor locks dont work quite that well
creations-chat 2018-11-12 06:54:21 also i barely get any screen time from my parents so i put as much effort as i can into the little time i have to use it
creations-chat 2018-11-12 06:54:44 yeah
creations-chat 2018-11-12 06:54:57 center of thrust needs to be almost perfectly aligned with center of mass
creations-chat 2018-11-12 06:55:06 center of lift isnt as important as it is with plans
creations-chat 2018-11-12 06:55:08 planes*
creations-chat 2018-11-12 06:55:17 since your engines can balance that out
creations-chat 2018-11-12 06:55:22 but its still vital
creations-chat 2018-11-12 06:55:31 yeah ik
creations-chat 2018-11-12 06:55:35 it was suggested before
creations-chat 2018-11-12 06:56:17 well i mean they're way harder with a dual engine configuration
creations-chat 2018-11-12 06:56:32 but with a dual engine configuration you'd at least know where your center of thrust is
creations-chat 2018-11-12 06:56:50 you just have to line up the engines with your center of mass
creations-chat 2018-11-12 06:56:59 it's harder with 4 engines
creations-chat 2018-11-12 06:57:10 but 4 engines are way more stable and balanced
creations-chat 2018-11-12 06:57:13 yep
creations-chat 2018-11-12 06:57:32 a lot of the stuff you do at first in this game is trial and error
creations-chat 2018-11-12 06:57:37 if it works, adjust it
creations-chat 2018-11-12 06:57:43 doesn't work*
creations-chat 2018-11-12 06:57:55 until it works the way you want it to
creations-chat 2018-11-12 07:03:15 when i hear nacelles i think of the ones onthe enterprise lol

creations-chat 2018-11-18 16:57:43 and make sure the two pieces you are trying to fold together don't touch each other, and they only touch the motor that folds them
creations-chat 2018-11-18 16:57:54 so the motor can unfold them to make them longer
creations-chat 2018-11-18 16:59:34 uhh
creations-chat 2018-11-18 16:59:35 ok
creations-chat 2018-11-18 17:08:25 make the center of mass extremely well aligned with the engines
creations-chat 2018-11-18 17:08:49 if they are well aligned, you wont move forward/backward when hovering
creations-chat 2018-11-18 17:09:02 if it's well aligned you will hover very well
creations-chat 2018-11-18 17:09:33 not if you reduce thrust
creations-chat 2018-11-18 17:09:43 so that you have the balance of thrust and weight

help 2018-11-19 16:24:47 You need a basic understanding of aerodynamics in order to play this game well
help 2018-11-19 16:25:15 It also depends on what orientation you place the control surfaces
help 2018-11-19 16:25:29 If they're upside down, you can't notice that

creations-chat 2018-11-21 04:59:40 paint it
creations-chat 2018-11-21 04:59:42 uHH
creations-chat 2018-11-21 05:00:01 navy blue
creations-chat 2018-11-21 05:00:47 yeah i think less fuselage and more wings is better
creations-chat 2018-11-21 05:01:03 if the belly doesn't protect anything important
creations-chat 2018-11-21 05:01:09 then remove some of it
creations-chat 2018-11-21 05:01:50 can i see it from another angle?
creations-chat 2018-11-21 05:02:02 yeah
creations-chat 2018-11-21 05:03:00 it certainly looks a little better
creations-chat 2018-11-21 05:03:09 with the belly being less fat
creations-chat 2018-11-21 05:03:58 i can tell you're making your fighter longer
creations-chat 2018-11-21 05:04:04 and slightly less wide
creations-chat 2018-11-21 05:04:13 so you're less of a target
creations-chat 2018-11-21 05:04:30 if you're going very fast the length doesn't matter all that much anyways
creations-chat 2018-11-21 05:04:34 good improvements
creations-chat 2018-11-21 05:04:39 👍
bug-reports 2018-11-21 05:08:08 yeah it happens

creations-chat 2018-11-21 05:14:10 navy blue
creations-chat 2018-11-21 05:14:15 matches black well
creations-chat 2018-11-21 05:14:34 just depends on which navy blue you use
creations-chat 2018-11-21 05:14:58 well i think any dark color that doesn't stand out would do just fine
creations-chat 2018-11-21 05:15:13 or extremely bright colors to show off cause you can't be beaten
creations-chat 2018-11-21 05:15:52 i may create a Lockheed_Martin account for fighters
creations-chat 2018-11-21 05:16:10 but not normal fighters, ones specifically designed for ingame combat

creations-chat 2018-11-21 05:30:41 ill use flashy colors when i've gotten confident i can take on some people pretty well and win
creations-chat 2018-11-21 05:31:32 ok
creations-chat 2018-11-21 05:31:45 yeah
creations-chat 2018-11-21 05:31:58 square with angled corners
creations-chat 2018-11-21 05:32:27 less weight at the top
creations-chat 2018-11-21 05:32:35 more weight on the feet
creations-chat 2018-11-21 05:33:08 i know
creations-chat 2018-11-21 05:33:14 but so you dont fall down next time
creations-chat 2018-11-21 05:33:22 im not a patrick seastar
creations-chat 2018-11-21 05:33:26 i dont live under a rock
creations-chat 2018-11-21 05:34:01 james should i use my lockheed corporation account and make a good pvp fighter jet tomorrow?
creations-chat 2018-11-21 05:36:08 mk
creations-chat 2018-11-21 05:38:43 so 200-400 blocks is the ideal size?
creations-chat 2018-11-21 05:40:32 so, more wings than blocks for more survivability so you can keep flying, 200-400 blocks is ideal size for the fighter, use thrusters to help maneuverability and make the fighter least wide as possible without compromising maneuverability with control surfaces, and longer to compensate for lost wings by reducing width?
creations-chat 2018-11-21 05:40:44 those are the general tips for creating a good fighter
creations-chat 2018-11-21 05:41:13 and make it fast so it's hard to hit and more maneuverable since more air passes over the control surfaces more quickly, obviously
creations-chat 2018-11-21 05:41:23 yeah narrow fighter
creations-chat 2018-11-21 05:41:36 but make it longer so you still have the same amount of wings and lift
creations-chat 2018-11-21 05:41:54 because you fly faster, longer doesn't make too much of a difference
creations-chat 2018-11-21 05:41:59 compared to width
creations-chat 2018-11-21 05:42:32 if you fly with your bottom towards your target, it's like firing at an enemy ship broadside
creations-chat 2018-11-21 05:42:33 yeah
creations-chat 2018-11-21 05:43:00 reduce profile in other areas but you can't reduce profile everywhere without sacrificing something
creations-chat 2018-11-21 05:43:09 yeah i see
creations-chat 2018-11-21 05:43:21 i'll keep these tips in mind
creations-chat 2018-11-21 05:43:27 gonna go afk to watch robocop now
creations-chat 2018-11-21 05:43:33 the original trilogy
creations-chat 2018-11-21 07:35:21 technically if new folding techniques were inventor-worthy i'd have inventor 4 or 5 times over
creations-chat 2018-11-21 07:35:35 uh
creations-chat 2018-11-21 07:35:41 probably nt
creations-chat 2018-11-21 07:36:00 if you are inventive enough anything is possible with motors
creations-chat 2018-11-21 07:37:41 easy tbh
creations-chat 2018-11-21 07:37:58 motors and some rope maybe
creations-chat 2018-11-21 07:38:09 and some wing panels
creations-chat 2018-11-21 07:38:58 what you making
creations-chat 2018-11-21 07:39:13 i can make anything below 3k blocks fly
creations-chat 2018-11-21 07:39:24 maybe 3k or 4k
creations-chat 2018-11-21 07:39:41 but itll take a heck of a lot of engines if i dont use helium
creations-chat 2018-11-21 07:39:48 helium is cheating imo
creations-chat 2018-11-21 07:46:37 carrier more like floating platform that's so thin it'll probably break under the weight of a single car <@427466925275217931>
creations-chat 2018-11-21 07:46:55 its not a helicarrier though
creations-chat 2018-11-21 07:47:19 not a carrier either, technically
creations-chat 2018-11-21 07:47:33 yes
creations-chat 2018-11-21 07:47:51 a carrier is a runway for aircraft and can store aircraft
creations-chat 2018-11-21 08:17:53 no engine visible in sight
creations-chat 2018-11-21 08:18:00 at least have a hole for a jet
creations-chat 2018-11-21 08:21:56 you did say it was BASED off the p40 warhawk didn't you?
creations-chat 2018-11-21 08:22:01 not that it actually WAS one
creations-chat 2018-11-21 08:22:08 if it was, it looks nothing like a P40
creations-chat 2018-11-21 08:22:38 and if you meant for it to be based off of a P40, at least add a propellor engine
creations-chat 2018-11-21 08:22:52 and i know you cant because it's an even amount of blocks wide
creations-chat 2018-11-21 08:23:31 so that is why a hole for a jet would be ideal, since it would be easiest to add
creations-chat 2018-11-21 08:23:45 instead of recreating the whole thing just for a propellor engine and propellors
creations-chat 2018-11-21 08:24:04 so, is it based off of a P40 or is it a copy of a P40?
creations-chat 2018-11-21 08:24:15 doesn't look like a P40 at all
creations-chat 2018-11-21 08:24:40 ah wait it isn't an even number of blocks wide
creations-chat 2018-11-21 08:24:47 can you not
creations-chat 2018-11-21 08:24:54 this is <#504436696021204992>

creations-chat 2018-11-23 22:58:07 
creations-chat 2018-11-23 22:58:17 cause it was made before 1x1 delta wings

creations-chat 2018-11-23 22:59:56 you could put control surfaces there
creations-chat 2018-11-23 22:59:59 instead of a delta wing
creations-chat 2018-11-23 23:00:10 and have very good combat maneuverability

creations-chat 2018-11-23 23:06:02 yeah but there would be gaps in the wing
creations-chat 2018-11-23 23:06:32 mine still looks better xdxd

creations-chat 2018-11-30 08:08:23 technically it doesn't dogfight, it maneuvers like a fighter aircraft but when fighting other vehicles, it's easier to stop midair and shoot while using thrusters to control it while midair and then flying away once the opponent has a chance fo shoot at you directly
creations-chat 2018-11-30 08:11:38 dogfighting at high speeds is hard with keybinds imo

creations-chat 2018-12-07 05:08:30 yes
help 2018-12-07 05:09:11 more speed = better maneuverability (if you use control surfaces)
help 2018-12-07 05:09:30 because more air travels across the wings more quickly
help 2018-12-07 05:09:40 which makes control surfaces more effective
help 2018-12-07 05:10:03 since they manipulate the forces of the air to move the aircraft
help 2018-12-07 05:10:17 this F-84 goes at 400 and turns very well
help 2018-12-07 05:10:28 it can do a complete 360 in 2 seconds
help 2018-12-07 05:10:37 yes
help 2018-12-07 05:11:23 if you want to barrel roll, you cant use mouse controls
help 2018-12-07 05:11:43 then idk how you cant do a barrel roll
help 2018-12-07 05:11:49 if you say it has good maneuverability
help 2018-12-07 05:12:00 i prefer control surfaces
help 2018-12-07 05:12:12 then use the keybinds you use for roll
help 2018-12-07 05:12:27 and hold them until you do an ailerion roll
help 2018-12-07 05:12:28 what
help 2018-12-07 05:12:52 the point of roll is to be able to roll the aircraft, as if it were a barrel rolling sown an angled surface
help 2018-12-07 05:13:00 so it does a complete 360
help 2018-12-07 05:13:14 i dont think you have enough roll control surfaces <@!251995895405477888>
help 2018-12-07 05:13:26 if you cant roll 360 degrees

help 2018-12-07 05:14:20 you are using a rudder?
help 2018-12-07 05:14:21 for roll?
help 2018-12-07 05:14:52 roll is if one wing is higher than the other wing is

help 2018-12-07 05:15:46 boy what
help 2018-12-07 05:16:09 if you are going to ask a question about aerodynamics at least have the knowledge to understand it
help 2018-12-07 05:16:17 no, it would not
help 2018-12-07 05:16:27 it would depending on the aircraft
help 2018-12-07 05:16:36 because the nose would make it yaw to the right
help 2018-12-07 05:16:46 the nose is heavy, it doesnt have no mass
help 2018-12-07 05:16:55 the nose will cause it to yaw to the direction you are rolling in
help 2018-12-07 05:17:06 because the weight of the nose pushes it down
help 2018-12-07 05:17:52 so if you roll right, the weight of the nose pushes it down a bit, and if you have rolled right a little and the nose has gone down a little, that would make it yaw
help 2018-12-07 05:18:05 not all planes are 100% balanced
help 2018-12-07 05:18:15 if they were, they would not yaw as much when rolling
help 2018-12-07 05:18:47 i answered your question twice

help 2018-12-07 05:18:58 then why keep asking

help 2018-12-28 06:25:48 no, that doesn't really help it that much
help 2018-12-28 06:26:32 well they have a lot of lift
help 2018-12-28 06:26:39 and large elevators
help 2018-12-28 06:26:56 biplanes are best at turning because of their high amount of lift

help 2018-12-28 06:27:48 idk im not an aerospace engineer but they aren't supposed to be very close
help 2018-12-28 06:28:09 because otherwise i think the horizontal stabilizers would have less of an effect

help 2018-12-28 06:33:07 p40
help 2018-12-28 06:33:24 the spitfire had very long and wide wings
help 2018-12-28 06:33:29 so it generated a lot of lift
help 2018-12-28 06:33:34 which makes it more maneuverable
help 2018-12-28 06:34:04 maneuvering is just changing the amount of lift on certain parts of an aircraft so the more lift you have the more you can reduce the amount of lift in a certain part of an aircraft
help 2018-12-28 06:34:59 p40 and hurricane are decent at turn fighting but not as good as others

bug-reports 2019-02-02 07:02:46 that's just wobbling
bug-reports 2019-02-02 07:02:55 it indicates your plane is unstable
bug-reports 2019-02-02 07:03:26 the axis in which it's wobbling tells you what part of the plane is unstable
bug-reports 2019-02-02 07:04:15 usually wobbling up and down would mean you need more stability for pitch, which means you need to increase the amount of wings in your horizontal stabilizers
bug-reports 2019-02-02 07:04:23 aka tailplanes, or tail wings
bug-reports 2019-02-02 07:04:32 that doesn't include the rudder

bug-reports 2019-02-10 21:10:57 obviously they are attached
bug-reports 2019-02-10 21:11:34 since the sides have at least a part of a face touching the sides, which means they are set to weld to anything that touches that side

bug-reports 2019-02-10 21:23:47 
bug-reports 2019-02-10 21:24:11 if a part of the side is welding, the entire side welds to anything that touches that side
bug-reports 2019-02-10 21:24:47 if the game were more precise in welding then it would take a lot more data for each block cause the game would have to measure which parts are touching the hitbox

bug-reports 2019-02-18 05:00:33 its not 260 bytes
bug-reports 2019-02-18 05:00:35 260 megabytes
bug-reports 2019-02-18 05:00:42 it's 260.000
bug-reports 2019-02-18 05:00:46 so 260,000
bug-reports 2019-02-18 05:00:58 actually 260 kilobytes then
bug-reports 2019-02-18 05:01:31 and the save limit isn't using bytes as the unit of measurement
bug-reports 2019-02-18 05:02:48 what
bug-reports 2019-02-18 05:03:03 how did i say that?
bug-reports 2019-02-18 05:04:09 you can't go very far past the limit of 260.000 save data
bug-reports 2019-02-18 05:04:56 if you try and save while past the limit thereis a very high probability the save won't save and the next time you join the game the save reverts
creations-chat 2019-02-18 05:05:16 not smallest coaxial
bug-reports 2019-02-18 05:05:28 what
bug-reports 2019-02-18 05:05:38 those boats take up like 150k save data
bug-reports 2019-02-18 05:05:50 so they use alt accounts to make them
bug-reports 2019-02-18 05:06:10 i have filled up the save data on over 4 alt accounts now
bug-reports 2019-02-18 05:07:01 what
bug-reports 2019-02-18 05:07:19 the game is limited to give you 260 save data
bug-reports 2019-02-18 05:07:27 it PHYSICALLY CANNOT GIVE YOU MORE
bug-reports 2019-02-18 05:07:36 unless we ask roblox themselves to give us more data
bug-reports 2019-02-18 05:07:52 and that would probably cost money
bug-reports 2019-02-18 05:08:39 yes
bug-reports 2019-02-18 05:08:47 and as i said before
bug-reports 2019-02-18 05:08:51 they're not bytes
bug-reports 2019-02-18 05:09:27 i said
bug-reports 2019-02-18 05:09:30 they're not bytes
bug-reports 2019-02-18 05:09:44 not bytes, not kilobytes, not megabytes, not gigabytes
bug-reports 2019-02-18 05:09:57 the save data isn't using bytes as a unit of measurement for the data
bug-reports 2019-02-18 05:10:11 i tried to fucking tell you this in the simplest way
bug-reports 2019-02-18 05:10:23 and you literally can't comprehend what i am saying
bug-reports 2019-02-18 05:10:57 then try and ACTUALLY comprehend what i am saying
bug-reports 2019-02-18 05:11:08 because you're just not
bug-reports 2019-02-18 05:12:37 yes but then i realized that the game wouldn't be using so little data for each block
bug-reports 2019-02-18 05:12:41 so it's not actually bytes
bug-reports 2019-02-18 05:12:59 if they were bytes then it would be 260 kb
bug-reports 2019-02-18 05:13:11 but they're not using bytes at least i think
bug-reports 2019-02-18 05:13:33 who is they
bug-reports 2019-02-18 05:14:00 what
bug-reports 2019-02-18 05:14:30 other people are using bytes as the unit of measurement because it's easier to understand
bug-reports 2019-02-18 05:14:49 otherwise you would just be saying 260 units of save data
bug-reports 2019-02-18 05:20:59 what
bug-reports 2019-02-18 05:21:07 they do give you the option to delete a build
bug-reports 2019-02-18 05:21:22 just save over the save slot with an empty plot

help 2019-03-03 19:03:37 it doesnt provide extra thrust
help 2019-03-03 19:03:54 motors unpowered dont provide thrust
help 2019-03-03 19:04:07 thats because if you're going at like 500+ speeds with rocket engines
help 2019-03-03 19:04:15 the speed of the plane is too fast
help 2019-03-03 19:04:19 the drag is too great
help 2019-03-03 19:04:24 for propellors to work
help 2019-03-03 19:04:47 so if you use 50 speed motors, the prop will be moving too slowly
help 2019-03-03 19:04:55 which means it will provide drag
help 2019-03-03 19:05:19 if it's unpowered, the prop will move faster, because the drag makees it spin as fast as strong as the drag
help 2019-03-03 19:05:38 if it's unpowered it just lets the wind move the prop
help 2019-03-03 19:05:46 and doesn't provide any thrust or remove any thrust
help 2019-03-03 19:06:16 if it was powered at speed 50 the drag would be too great since the prop would be moving slower than if it was unpowered

contest-info 2019-03-30 01:29:07 A new type of contest has been introduced to this server: **Competitions!**

Instead of contests, where you have a limit of 7 days to complete a creation (or submit an existing one), competitions have a 10 minute timer, and all competitors must stay in the same server in order to be judged after they have all finished their creations. **You do not submit creations for competitions, all creations must be completely built from scratch within the time constraints and on the same server as all other competitors.** This way, it is easier to prove one's skill at this game. There can be multiple competitions ongoing on different servers, and it doesn't matter if there is a contest in progress or not, competitions will have no effect on contests. 

**This does not mean that contests are going to stop anytime soon. We are just introducing a new, more competitive and engaging form of the current contests, as they were meant to be.**

We will use the *secret* community VIP server for hosting competitions. I will give the invite link to other moderators in order to let them invite people.

contest-info 2019-04-01 23:55:41 This next contest will be hosted by me, starting at `5:00pm PST/7:00pm CST/8:00pm EST`. I won't reveal the contest topic yet, but I will start choosing competitors now. There will be a maximum of 8 competitors, with me and <@456226577798135808> being the judges for today.
The competition will take a total of 30 minutes: 10 minutes to build your creation, 5 minutes for everyone to go and test their creations (you can go back and change a few things to make it work better during this stage), 5 minutes for people to go back and revise their creations for the last time (you can't go test it any more times during this stage), and the last 10 minutes will be used for judging all the builds.
contest-info 2019-04-01 23:56:51 All competitors will be required to enable `Anti-copy blacklist` and blacklist everyone in the server. This is so that nobody can steal ideas from one another, (though the testing stage is there for you to do so freely)
contest-info 2019-04-01 23:57:28 @here React to this with the ping emoji if you would like to join the competition.
contest-info 2019-04-01 23:57:57 I will personally DM you with a private server link if you want to join.

creations-chat 2019-04-18 22:30:54 you need to post your text at the same time you post your image
creations-chat 2019-04-18 22:31:02 otherwise your text won't show up along with the image
creations-chat 2019-04-18 22:31:17 the creation bot only posts things that have an image in <#384025409945337856>

creations-chat 2019-04-18 22:32:10 we need this information to give you the proper rank
creations-chat 2019-04-18 22:32:16 i know
creations-chat 2019-04-18 22:32:53 also people don't think too highly of you if you upvote your own creation in <#384025409945337856> since it just means you're trying to get a lot of upvotes by adding your own
creations-chat 2019-04-18 22:34:16 actually, since cars don't really fall into anything in <#544022464133595166> since cars are the easiest thing to make in plane crazy, you should make a plane in order to get a rank
creations-chat 2019-04-18 22:34:38 if you don't have a rank, you don't have the ability to give suggestions in <#507673335816126509> so that's why ranks are important
creations-chat 2019-04-18 22:34:40 yes
creations-chat 2019-04-18 22:34:42 mods and up
creations-chat 2019-04-18 22:34:59 mods are usually busy so we don't rank people as often

creations-chat 2019-04-20 23:23:26 fold it 58592 times like g4
creations-chat 2019-04-20 23:24:00 g4 basically spazzed out while drawing the folding wings
creations-chat 2019-04-20 23:24:02 and it worked
creations-chat 2019-04-20 23:24:20 
creations-chat 2019-04-20 23:24:32 i found an effective way
creations-chat 2019-04-20 23:24:37 of making the motors stop
creations-chat 2019-04-20 23:24:42 at just the right angle
creations-chat 2019-04-20 23:24:50 you use half wedges and wing panels
creations-chat 2019-04-20 23:24:55 kinda visible
creations-chat 2019-04-20 23:24:57 but
creations-chat 2019-04-20 23:25:00 yes
creations-chat 2019-04-20 23:25:00 if the plane is large
creations-chat 2019-04-20 23:25:05 but
creations-chat 2019-04-20 23:25:07 it works well
creations-chat 2019-04-20 23:25:12 it gives it a slight angle
creations-chat 2019-04-20 23:25:19 when it limits the wing
creations-chat 2019-04-20 23:25:24 so it curves upwards naturally
creations-chat 2019-04-20 23:25:26 basically
creations-chat 2019-04-20 23:25:29 yes
creations-chat 2019-04-20 23:25:34 but wing panel on the other piece
creations-chat 2019-04-20 23:25:39 and half wedge instead of half block

bug-reports 2019-04-20 23:36:07 bruh
bug-reports 2019-04-20 23:38:16 it says 'Max Save Data'
bug-reports 2019-04-20 23:38:20 that is the 'cap'
bug-reports 2019-04-20 23:38:27 do you know the definition of 'cap'?
bug-reports 2019-04-20 23:38:35 it puts a limit to something
bug-reports 2019-04-20 23:38:52 a bottlecap limits the liquid inside a bottle from pouring out
bug-reports 2019-04-20 23:39:12 a price cap limits the amount of money you can sell/buy something for
bug-reports 2019-04-20 23:39:17 like bruh
help 2019-04-20 23:39:59 a seat takes up the most data
help 2019-04-20 23:40:02 since it has 4 parts
help 2019-04-20 23:40:09 so it is the most laggy
help 2019-04-20 23:40:11 actually no
help 2019-04-20 23:40:15 no it doesnt
help 2019-04-20 23:40:43 save data depends on how many orientations a block can be in, how many blocks its can occupy in the entire plot, how many there can be, etc
help 2019-04-20 23:40:48 yes, it does
help 2019-04-20 23:40:57 since the paint is more data for the game to store
help 2019-04-20 23:41:12 the game has to rememer that you painted that block
help 2019-04-20 23:41:17 so it takes more data to do so
help 2019-04-20 23:41:57 also if you enable/disable RGB colors you can get a lot more/less save data
help 2019-04-20 23:42:09 since RGB is like a few billion possibilities of colors
help 2019-04-20 23:42:24 so it increases the save data usage per block
help 2019-04-20 23:42:27 yes RGB
help 2019-04-20 23:42:31 redgreenblue
help 2019-04-20 23:42:49 it's a term that exists in basically the real world and any other game
help 2019-04-20 23:43:04 honestly how do you not know the definition for cap or RGB
help 2019-04-20 23:43:09 are you under 13?

help 2019-04-20 23:43:23 <:Thonk:509498568982134816>
help 2019-04-20 23:45:59 nope
help 2019-04-20 23:46:11 other than making the blocks purely white i think
help 2019-04-20 23:46:33 no
help 2019-04-20 23:46:35 im saying
help 2019-04-20 23:46:40 make the blocks all white
help 2019-04-20 23:46:51 so the game recognizes it as default white color
help 2019-04-20 23:47:04 if you disable RGB it does that
help 2019-04-20 23:47:13 honestly this is beginning to get frustrating

creations-chat 2019-06-27 08:09:19 typing differently can make you slower because you're not used to it

creations-chat 2019-06-27 08:12:04 everyone can understand it, but not everyone can withstand it
creations-chat 2019-06-27 08:12:40 and saying 'ya' instead of 'you' still counts as spelling a word wrong
creations-chat 2019-06-27 08:12:51 it's not the correct spelling
creations-chat 2019-06-27 08:13:36 and plus, if you run into someone who's even worse at understanding the english language than you, you might force them into thinking that 'ya' is a correct spelling of the word 'you' even though it's not
creations-chat 2019-06-27 08:13:45 because you're spelling it wrong
creations-chat 2019-06-27 08:14:05 u is better because at least it sounds like the word it's shortening
creations-chat 2019-06-27 08:14:11 but it looks nothing like it whatsoever
creations-chat 2019-06-27 08:14:23 still no point

creations-chat 2019-09-03 08:24:30 why though
creations-chat 2019-09-03 08:24:36 why capitalize capital
creations-chat 2019-09-03 08:24:40 it isn't supposed to be capitalized
creations-chat 2019-09-03 08:24:45 it's not a proper noun
creations-chat 2019-09-03 08:24:54 and it isn't the first word in the sentence
creations-chat 2019-09-03 08:25:03 so you capitalized the word capital for no reason at all
creations-chat 2019-09-03 08:25:13 yes it is
creations-chat 2019-09-03 08:25:20 you are laughing at your own grammaticla error
creations-chat 2019-09-03 08:25:22 it is not a name
creations-chat 2019-09-03 08:25:24 it is a noun
creations-chat 2019-09-03 08:25:33 capital is not a name
creations-chat 2019-09-03 08:25:44 what
creations-chat 2019-09-03 08:25:53 'funny one you're seems like autistic'
creations-chat 2019-09-03 08:25:57 can you learn english properly
creations-chat 2019-09-03 08:26:06 before trying to have a conversation in english
creations-chat 2019-09-03 08:26:26 i'm ignoring you every time you ask that question
creations-chat 2019-09-03 08:26:31 no you literally haven't <@!546223347025969164>
creations-chat 2019-09-03 08:27:32 over 1/4 of all sentences you have attempted to make throughout this conversation are so broken and grammatically incorrect that a person who literally has no knowledge of English could get a higher score than you on a 1st grade level English test
creations-chat 2019-09-03 08:28:16 do you even know what half of the words i just used mean
creations-chat 2019-09-03 08:28:36 bruh every sentence you type has at least 1 grammatical error
creations-chat 2019-09-03 08:28:40 do you?
creations-chat 2019-09-03 08:28:45 you capitalize a word for no reason
creations-chat 2019-09-03 08:28:53 and then continue to argue with me
creations-chat 2019-09-03 08:28:57 because of 1 thing
creations-chat 2019-09-03 08:29:14 the only thing you have to argue against me with is my choosing to not capitalize a certain letter of a word
creations-chat 2019-09-03 08:29:36 and nothing else
creations-chat 2019-09-03 08:29:42 you have nothing to go on for me
creations-chat 2019-09-03 08:29:56 for you though, you have consistently made horrible grammatical errors
creations-chat 2019-09-03 08:30:04 and you keep doing so
creations-chat 2019-09-03 08:30:18 you then continue to claim that you 'know English'
creations-chat 2019-09-03 08:30:27 i expected you to not insult me
creations-chat 2019-09-03 08:30:40 i wasn't the person who first sent an insult
creations-chat 2019-09-03 08:30:44 therefore you were being toxic first
creations-chat 2019-09-03 08:30:51 therefore you started this
creations-chat 2019-09-03 08:30:52 not me
creations-chat 2019-09-03 08:30:56 i didn't underestimate it
creations-chat 2019-09-03 08:31:01 i estimated it perfectly
creations-chat 2019-09-03 08:31:11 i'll give you my honest opinion on it then
creations-chat 2019-09-03 08:31:18 it's garbage, and it looks like shit
creations-chat 2019-09-03 08:31:23 that is my honest opinion
creations-chat 2019-09-03 08:31:42 you can ask other people for their opinions if you want
creations-chat 2019-09-03 08:31:48 also i know what you'll say about my ship
creations-chat 2019-09-03 08:31:56 it's going to be a biased answer
creations-chat 2019-09-03 08:32:04 bruh lmao
creations-chat 2019-09-03 08:32:07 'it look dumb ass'
creations-chat 2019-09-03 08:32:16 "didn't better than a noob's ship"
creations-chat 2019-09-03 08:32:53 these quotes could have been said by einstein and nobody could tell the difference
creations-chat 2019-09-03 08:33:10 bruh you made a grammatical error in QUOTING me
creations-chat 2019-09-03 08:33:25 how are you physically incapable of copying and pasting a piece of a sentence?
creations-chat 2019-09-03 08:33:48 you're the one who tried to call me autistic
creations-chat 2019-09-03 08:33:53 and i use the word 'try'
creations-chat 2019-09-03 08:34:02 you *tried*
creations-chat 2019-09-03 08:34:06 but you failed so horribly
creations-chat 2019-09-03 08:34:38 if you give up in trying to argue with me now, i will ignore everything that has happened before this very moment
creations-chat 2019-09-03 08:34:41 if you don't
creations-chat 2019-09-03 08:34:50 then you are in denial
creations-chat 2019-09-03 08:35:00 trying to protect yourself from other people calling your builds bad
creations-chat 2019-09-03 08:35:21 you insult other people because they say your build is bad
creations-chat 2019-09-03 08:35:33 then you get into an argument with one, backing yourself into a corner
creations-chat 2019-09-03 08:35:41 the only way out of this is to admit you are wrong
creations-chat 2019-09-03 08:36:02 i didn't 'try to underestimate' it
creations-chat 2019-09-03 08:36:16 i looked at it, formed an opinion, then said it
creations-chat 2019-09-03 08:36:22 how am i lying
creations-chat 2019-09-03 08:36:47 you don't
creations-chat 2019-09-03 08:36:51 you 'compare'
creations-chat 2019-09-03 08:36:54 in present tense
creations-chat 2019-09-03 08:36:56 not past tense
creations-chat 2019-09-03 08:37:07 you don't "compared" two things
creations-chat 2019-09-03 08:37:13 you *compare* two things
creations-chat 2019-09-03 08:37:23 it is my honest opinion
creations-chat 2019-09-03 08:37:33 it was formed without bias
creations-chat 2019-09-03 08:37:46 i kept the opinion throughout this supposed 'argument'
creations-chat 2019-09-03 08:37:54 yes
creations-chat 2019-09-03 08:38:15 uh
creations-chat 2019-09-03 08:38:17 can't
creations-chat 2019-09-03 08:38:18 rn
creations-chat 2019-09-03 08:38:20 maybe tomorrow
creations-chat 2019-09-03 08:38:39 technically today, since it is 1 am here
creations-chat 2019-09-03 08:38:55 okay can you stop saying 'underestimate' like you know the definition of that word?
creations-chat 2019-09-03 08:39:00 you clearly do not
creations-chat 2019-09-03 08:39:37 can you type in *not* broken English, please?
creations-chat 2019-09-03 08:39:49 i can't read what you're saying properly
creations-chat 2019-09-03 08:40:02 and therefore i cannot determine the true meaning behind your words
creations-chat 2019-09-03 08:40:15 ok so he just resorts to correcting me
creations-chat 2019-09-03 08:40:22 even though i just choose not to capitalize
creations-chat 2019-09-03 08:40:26 it is simpler
creations-chat 2019-09-03 08:40:41 though i bet he's going to say "it is also simpler to make spelling mistakes and grammar mistakes"
creations-chat 2019-09-03 08:40:47 except in broken English
creations-chat 2019-09-03 08:40:58 not toxic, just saying my honest opinion
creations-chat 2019-09-03 08:41:21 if someone says it's 'not that good', they're trying to make you feel better
creations-chat 2019-09-03 08:41:38 yes
creations-chat 2019-09-03 08:41:46 your 'plane' took 2 hours
creations-chat 2019-09-03 08:41:50 my ship took 2 hours
creations-chat 2019-09-03 08:41:59 can you see the difference?

creations-chat 2019-09-03 08:42:48 it's like saying 'u' is a short form of you
creations-chat 2019-09-03 08:42:52 it just makes you look stupid
creations-chat 2019-09-03 08:43:22 bruh
creations-chat 2019-09-03 08:43:28 what does rickje have to do with anything
creations-chat 2019-09-03 08:43:49 that's like saying 'go ask Jesus Christ if being under 13 is against discord TOS'

creations-chat 2019-09-03 08:45:43 'it must you fam'
creations-chat 2019-09-03 08:45:51 'it must you'
creations-chat 2019-09-03 08:45:58 what the hell does 'it must you' mean
creations-chat 2019-09-03 08:46:08 this is like asking 'what is the meaning of life?'
creations-chat 2019-09-03 08:46:13 there will never be an answer
creations-chat 2019-09-03 08:46:24 and the question itself will remain a mystery for thousands of years

creations-chat 2019-09-03 23:30:02 at the current front part
creations-chat 2019-09-03 23:30:38 usually placing wedges first is easier because then if you place blocks first and try to use wedges it's much harder
creations-chat 2019-09-03 23:30:51 since most shapes are pretty hard to perfectly recreate in the game

creations-chat 2019-09-04 01:55:33 already seen
creations-chat 2019-09-04 02:09:30 original but not good enough for inventor
creations-chat 2019-09-04 02:09:54 if inventor was for *anything* original, it would be easy to get inventor
creations-chat 2019-09-04 02:10:02 but it's not meant to be easy
creations-chat 2019-09-04 02:10:12 only the best have/can get inventor
creations-chat 2019-09-04 02:11:43 not useful
creations-chat 2019-09-04 02:11:59 to be honest almost anything pvp related can't get inventor because nobody intelligent plays pvp anyways
creations-chat 2019-09-04 02:13:11 the game is nowhere near centered around pvp
creations-chat 2019-09-04 02:13:28 anyone who has a brain knows that pvp is useless and only for low iq kids 😎
creations-chat 2019-09-04 02:13:40 yes that proves my point
creations-chat 2019-09-04 02:13:54 yeah but copying them is a low iq act

creations-chat 2019-09-04 02:15:23 ok should i add actual masts to my ship yes or no

creations-chat 2019-09-04 02:15:42 to tilt
creations-chat 2019-09-04 02:15:52 but that wouldn't really be inventor either
creations-chat 2019-09-04 02:15:53 idk
creations-chat 2019-09-04 02:16:00 if you make it look cool enough, then you get inventor
creations-chat 2019-09-04 02:16:29 i said probably not
creations-chat 2019-09-04 02:16:36 but go ahead and try
creations-chat 2019-09-04 02:16:41 ~~and then get denied~~
creations-chat 2019-09-04 02:17:04 no
creations-chat 2019-09-04 02:17:21 no
creations-chat 2019-09-04 02:17:23 because alts

creations-chat 2019-09-04 02:25:58 it is the hardest role to get <@!356609457314332672>
creations-chat 2019-09-04 02:26:17 the universe would end before most of the people in this server got inventor
creations-chat 2019-09-04 02:26:52 well it kind of does
creations-chat 2019-09-04 02:26:54 but only barely
creations-chat 2019-09-04 02:27:09 why
creations-chat 2019-09-04 02:27:20 tnt magnet cannons have been invented
creations-chat 2019-09-04 02:27:34 clusterbombs have been invented
creations-chat 2019-09-04 02:27:42 railguns have been invented
creations-chat 2019-09-04 02:27:56 pretty sure he did
creations-chat 2019-09-04 02:28:48 yes well they took the ideas already
creations-chat 2019-09-04 02:28:54 why should we make the role easier to get?
creations-chat 2019-09-04 02:29:05 didn't you say you were going to try your hardest to get the hardest rank?
creations-chat 2019-09-04 02:29:11 so don't try to make it easier to get
creations-chat 2019-09-04 02:29:17 because you won't make it easier to get
creations-chat 2019-09-04 02:29:48 they probably got inspiration from something else
creations-chat 2019-09-04 02:29:56 actually most likely
creations-chat 2019-09-04 02:30:00 tell me one of them then
creations-chat 2019-09-04 02:30:09 if they are considered worthy for inventor
creations-chat 2019-09-04 02:30:28 no
creations-chat 2019-09-04 02:33:18 like a bird?
creations-chat 2019-09-04 02:33:21 already done
creations-chat 2019-09-04 02:33:39 people have made planes that fly by only flapping their wings
creations-chat 2019-09-04 02:34:01 yes that uses game physics to move
creations-chat 2019-09-04 02:34:45 so magnet engines?
creations-chat 2019-09-04 02:35:04 no
creations-chat 2019-09-04 02:35:29 what do you mean by a plane with no engines then
creations-chat 2019-09-04 02:35:45 a magnet engine isn't an engine block type
creations-chat 2019-09-04 02:36:03 custom propellor engines aren't engine types
creations-chat 2019-09-04 02:36:14 yes, so magnet engines
creations-chat 2019-09-04 02:36:35 they literally use a glitch to travel up to huge speeds
creations-chat 2019-09-04 02:36:37 yes i know
creations-chat 2019-09-04 02:36:41 it's an example
creations-chat 2019-09-04 02:36:53 yes i know
creations-chat 2019-09-04 02:36:57 it's happened plenty of times

creations-chat 2019-09-04 02:37:28 this was done within 10 minutes
creations-chat 2019-09-04 02:37:41 well if you can, then you would be able to get inventor
creations-chat 2019-09-04 02:37:47 but you said 'get flung'
creations-chat 2019-09-04 02:37:52 how would you be able to steer
creations-chat 2019-09-04 02:37:55 while getting flung
creations-chat 2019-09-04 02:38:10 a magnet engine is the only thing that's similar to what you described
creations-chat 2019-09-04 02:38:33 uses a glitch to go to much higher speeds than possible, and is easy to steer
creations-chat 2019-09-04 02:39:01 you can go up to 100k speed
creations-chat 2019-09-04 02:39:05 yes well good luck

creations-chat 2019-12-11 15:40:28 because you shouldnt have built it the wrong way around
creations-chat 2019-12-12 04:15:24 what does it even mean
creations-chat 2019-12-12 04:15:37 are you saying that the northern virginia flag isn't a hate symbol?
creations-chat 2019-12-12 04:15:39 course it isn't
creations-chat 2019-12-12 04:15:56 however if you use it in a way to denounce the abolishment of slavery then we have an issue
creations-chat 2019-12-12 04:16:09 i never said you said it was either, so idk what you're talking about
creations-chat 2019-12-12 04:16:13 i just asked what you were saying
creations-chat 2019-12-12 04:16:17 since the message isn't very clear
creations-chat 2019-12-12 04:16:23 'heritage not hate'
creations-chat 2019-12-12 04:16:40 you mean your heritage is of the northern virginia flag and not of the US flag?
creations-chat 2019-12-12 04:17:11 as in, you are from the south and decide to use that flag because it's your heritage
creations-chat 2019-12-12 04:17:12 yes
creations-chat 2019-12-12 04:17:34 nobody cares about that flag
creations-chat 2019-12-12 04:17:40 if somebody gets triggered then too bad
creations-chat 2019-12-12 04:17:53 but i've never seen anyone in this server get triggered by it
creations-chat 2019-12-12 04:18:06 i said nobody cares enough to get angry because of it
creations-chat 2019-12-12 04:18:21 since clearly you're trying to tell people that your intended purpose is to show your heritage
creations-chat 2019-12-12 04:18:39 when most people already know that
creations-chat 2019-12-12 04:19:04 i haven't seen any
creations-chat 2019-12-12 04:19:07 care to point them out?
creations-chat 2019-12-12 04:19:47 yeah downvoting something does not mean they are ignorant assholes
creations-chat 2019-12-12 04:19:52 if that's your opinion then ok
creations-chat 2019-12-12 04:20:13 most people downvoted it because it's not a creation that deserves upvotes since it's a flag and 3 words
creations-chat 2019-12-12 04:20:21 i mean 2 flags not 1 flag
creations-chat 2019-12-12 04:20:39 they didn't downvote it because of the message you were trying to convey
creations-chat 2019-12-12 04:23:21 cliché*
creations-chat 2019-12-12 04:24:37 grammar is useful because people can know what you're saying
creations-chat 2019-12-12 04:24:53 it would be helpful if you were to use grammar correctly *all* the time
creations-chat 2019-12-12 04:24:59 and i'm not talking about capitalization or punctuation
creations-chat 2019-12-12 04:25:04 those aren't as useful as grammar

creations-chat 2019-12-13 00:30:07 also the turret looks a bit tall, you can remove those half blocks at the bottom of the turret and use 0.9 blocks so that the turret is flush to the hull
creations-chat 2019-12-13 00:30:23 since it seems that the turret is flush with the hull in the reference image
creations-chat 2019-12-13 00:30:43 also the front upper glacis doesn't seem to be very accurate compared to the reference image

help 2019-12-20 02:40:28 ok
help 2019-12-20 02:41:31 never had a migraine so i cant relate 😎
help 2019-12-20 02:42:18 how do you sleep with a migraine
help 2019-12-20 02:42:29 ah yes
help 2019-12-20 02:42:31 great advice
help 2019-12-20 02:42:46 'i have a gunshot wound'
medic: 'just sleep it off'
creations-chat 2019-12-20 02:44:42 ok so not his actual first creation then
creations-chat 2019-12-20 02:44:52 he was asking if it was your first ever creation
help 2019-12-20 02:46:15 ok
bug-reports 2019-12-20 02:48:18 motors
creations-chat 2019-12-20 02:53:09 yes
creations-chat 2019-12-20 02:54:00 thats not how it works
creations-chat 2019-12-20 02:54:15 propellor engines and propellor blades have nothing in common
creations-chat 2019-12-20 02:54:25 other than their names and being used for movement
creations-chat 2019-12-20 02:54:53 rick would literally need to script hydrodynamics in order to add water propellor blades
creations-chat 2019-12-20 02:55:04 the game only has aerodynamics
creations-chat 2019-12-20 02:55:17 that would almost be like remaking the entire game
creations-chat 2019-12-20 03:07:27 why does a shuttlecraft have rockets
creations-chat 2019-12-20 03:07:47 also most people use ballast blocks on a plane
creations-chat 2019-12-20 03:07:52 in order to balance it
creations-chat 2019-12-20 03:08:21 if you have space to hide the wings then yes do that
creations-chat 2019-12-20 03:08:24 if you don't
creations-chat 2019-12-20 03:08:31 then ballast blocks are your only option
creations-chat 2019-12-20 03:08:58 i mean your main wings should have started roughly where the intakes are
creations-chat 2019-12-20 03:09:05 which would have helped
creations-chat 2019-12-20 03:09:18 and your horizontal stabilizers might be 1 block too far back
creations-chat 2019-12-20 03:10:03 uhhhhh
creations-chat 2019-12-20 03:10:04 better
creations-chat 2019-12-20 03:10:05 but not
creations-chat 2019-12-20 03:10:07 great
creations-chat 2019-12-20 03:10:20 the whole thing
creations-chat 2019-12-20 03:10:27 at least you added wedges
creations-chat 2019-12-20 03:10:32 yes
creations-chat 2019-12-20 03:10:34 an a320
creations-chat 2019-12-20 03:11:10 idk
creations-chat 2019-12-20 03:11:21 i think the people who made the a320 also made the 747
creations-chat 2019-12-20 03:11:28 and the f-15
creations-chat 2019-12-20 03:11:38 no

creations-chat 2019-12-20 03:13:38 <@!424777878471835648> dont ping me when sending a picture
creations-chat 2019-12-20 03:14:25 the aerodynamic fairings that cover the engines are too small <@!465412976187408385>

creations-chat 2019-12-20 03:15:34 what
creations-chat 2019-12-20 03:15:38 thats not even what i said
creations-chat 2019-12-20 03:16:15 <@!465412976187408385> ok
creations-chat 2019-12-20 03:17:34 yes
creations-chat 2019-12-20 03:18:03 it depends on what you mean by 'better' <@!266119209652715521>
creations-chat 2019-12-20 03:18:12 spacex is better at launching rockets
creations-chat 2019-12-20 03:20:39 nasa is a government organization which focuses on science rather than mainly just launching rockets
creations-chat 2019-12-20 03:21:46 why <@!424777878471835648>
creations-chat 2019-12-20 03:22:11 the wings shouldnt have 1x1 delta
creations-chat 2019-12-20 03:22:16 yes front part
creations-chat 2019-12-20 03:22:17 back part
creations-chat 2019-12-20 03:22:21 change it to 1x3 or 1x4
creations-chat 2019-12-20 03:22:28 1x4
bug-reports 2019-12-20 06:48:46 actually you can get like 10000 of every block
bug-reports 2019-12-20 06:48:52 because if you switch materials
bug-reports 2019-12-20 06:49:00 the block will swap
bug-reports 2019-12-20 06:49:06 from 'Block 1x1'
bug-reports 2019-12-20 06:49:14 to 'Wooden Block 1x1'
bug-reports 2019-12-20 06:49:25 if you place 5 normal blocks down you have 1995 left
bug-reports 2019-12-20 06:49:35 but if you check for wooden blocks, you'll still have 2000
bug-reports 2019-12-20 06:49:50 so theoretically you can have way more than just 2000
bug-reports 2019-12-20 06:49:58 which is essentially what you are asking for
bug-reports 2019-12-20 06:50:08 except pvp weapons dont do that
bug-reports 2019-12-20 06:50:09 so e

the-dump 2019-12-24 04:37:27 why are you so easily entertained by the most inconsequential of things and then try to show people those things which they don't care about but you think they'll care about then because you care
the-dump 2019-12-24 04:38:03 acts exactly like someone i know
the-dump 2019-12-24 04:38:17 he's extremely annoying because he says 'hey guys check this thing out'
the-dump 2019-12-24 04:38:24 when we're talking about something else
the-dump 2019-12-24 04:38:32 and then he says the exact same thing again
the-dump 2019-12-24 04:38:36 because apparently we're all deaf
the-dump 2019-12-24 04:39:00 we heard what you said, we're ignoring you for a reason
the-dump 2019-12-24 04:39:06 and that is mostly the case here
the-dump 2019-12-24 04:39:21 we don't really care about these things because we already know about them
the-dump 2019-12-24 04:39:31 but you seem to think that we don't
the-dump 2019-12-24 04:39:49 anyone who has ever searched 'plane crazy' has found all those plane crash games
the-dump 2019-12-24 04:40:31 and anyone who has even existed on roblox for any serious amount of time will realize there's hundreds upon hundreds of games that are copied and then slightly changed in order to suck the pennies out of every brainless child
creations-chat 2019-12-24 09:48:40 <@430739561690431489> why would you want a seat design that has over 4x the amount of parts that the original seats have
creations-chat 2019-12-24 09:48:55 either the seat count would need to be reduced to 1000 or 500
creations-chat 2019-12-24 09:49:11 or rick would need to union the parts in the seat model
creations-chat 2019-12-24 09:49:17 and rick still hasn't done that
creations-chat 2019-12-24 09:49:27 the seat design isn't going to change
creations-chat 2019-12-24 09:49:49 either that or he'll just remove the backrest and armrests and just have an invisible seat brick

bug-reports 2020-02-05 06:34:36 roblox update
bug-reports 2020-02-05 06:34:37 meaning
bug-reports 2020-02-05 06:34:43 roblox updated the physics engine itself
bug-reports 2020-02-05 06:34:49 therefore messing up anchor blocks
bug-reports 2020-02-05 06:34:56 is it really that hard to use common sense?
bug-reports 2020-02-05 06:37:30 i don't get your anger either so idk
bug-reports 2020-02-05 06:37:51 no
bug-reports 2020-02-05 06:37:54 send them an envelope
bug-reports 2020-02-05 06:38:01 or just walk into their headquarters
bug-reports 2020-02-05 06:38:15 developers are literally exactly the same as you but with the ability to create games
bug-reports 2020-02-05 06:38:21 so uh bruh
bug-reports 2020-02-05 06:38:30 yes what did you expect from rickje
bug-reports 2020-02-05 06:38:41 and it is a game
bug-reports 2020-02-05 06:38:58 it's not rickje's fault he can't work on the game as long as he physically can
bug-reports 2020-02-05 06:39:17 imagine being mad at someone for something they have no control over
bug-reports 2020-02-05 06:39:25 well you have to be mad at something, right?
bug-reports 2020-02-05 06:40:07 ok so because you were able to something in some unrelated game designer you mean rickje can do that in plane crazy specifically?
bug-reports 2020-02-05 06:40:22 have you even considered how motors work
bug-reports 2020-02-05 06:40:31 also
bug-reports 2020-02-05 06:40:33 doom is literally
bug-reports 2020-02-05 06:40:35 from the 90s
bug-reports 2020-02-05 06:40:39 how is that impressive
bug-reports 2020-02-05 06:40:40 but
bug-reports 2020-02-05 06:40:40 yes it is
bug-reports 2020-02-05 06:40:42 i mean
bug-reports 2020-02-05 06:40:45 it's a recreation
bug-reports 2020-02-05 06:40:51 you said anchor
bug-reports 2020-02-05 06:40:55 rickje can freeze a creation easily
bug-reports 2020-02-05 06:41:06 but you said your creations hits stuff
bug-reports 2020-02-05 06:41:27 yes
bug-reports 2020-02-05 06:41:34 yes
bug-reports 2020-02-05 06:41:37 unless there is a motor
bug-reports 2020-02-05 06:41:40 then you have the problem
bug-reports 2020-02-05 06:41:54 yes or no
bug-reports 2020-02-05 06:42:01 not answering my question
bug-reports 2020-02-05 06:42:06 do you have a motor on your creation
bug-reports 2020-02-05 06:42:10 because a motor has 2 separate parts
bug-reports 2020-02-05 06:42:20 the part connected to an anchored block will be anchored
bug-reports 2020-02-05 06:42:29 but in order to function, the other part will not be anchored
bug-reports 2020-02-05 06:42:34 ok
bug-reports 2020-02-05 06:42:39 so it's not connected to the anchor block
bug-reports 2020-02-05 06:42:42 should have said that then
bug-reports 2020-02-05 06:43:00 then what is the problem
bug-reports 2020-02-05 06:43:02 explain what happens
bug-reports 2020-02-05 06:43:27 you mean motors not connected to the anchor block or the blocks it anchors don't rotate?
bug-reports 2020-02-05 06:43:59 but that's connected to the anchor block
bug-reports 2020-02-05 06:44:04 you said it's not connected to the anchor block
bug-reports 2020-02-05 06:44:10 the entire motor
bug-reports 2020-02-05 06:44:48 not connected to the anchor and spins fine
bug-reports 2020-02-05 06:44:53 anchor is anchored
bug-reports 2020-02-05 06:45:00 you said the motor was not connected to the motor AT ALL
bug-reports 2020-02-05 06:45:04 which misled me
bug-reports 2020-02-05 06:45:26 no you should have just said it was connected but only 1 part
bug-reports 2020-02-05 06:45:47 it's anchored
bug-reports 2020-02-05 06:46:11 i'm assuming it anchors certain blocks now instead of just the anchor block itself so that creations can be more stable with a single anchor
bug-reports 2020-02-05 06:46:29 still spins
bug-reports 2020-02-05 06:46:30 
bug-reports 2020-02-05 06:46:47 disconnectors don't work
bug-reports 2020-02-05 06:47:14 though only when placed a certain way
bug-reports 2020-02-05 06:48:18 maybe you shouldn't rely on anchors too much <@!317063655520993280>
bug-reports 2020-02-05 06:48:26 anchors weren't extremely good before either
bug-reports 2020-02-05 06:49:27 why do you need motors and disconnectors for people to dock then
bug-reports 2020-02-05 06:49:53 ok then don't anchor until you need to have a docking maneuver performed
bug-reports 2020-02-05 06:51:20 ok well either give up or wait until the game gets updated again
bug-reports 2020-02-05 06:51:25 or just keep trying
bug-reports 2020-02-05 06:52:31 seems more like an issue with motors then

bug-reports 2020-02-08 20:14:45 a minute long video is way more than the file limit
bug-reports 2020-02-08 20:14:54 you realize a video is multiple images right
bug-reports 2020-02-08 20:15:06 so if 1 image is just 100 kb and the video is at 30 fps
bug-reports 2020-02-08 20:15:14 then it's 30 100kb images per second
bug-reports 2020-02-08 20:15:17 so 3 mb per second
bug-reports 2020-02-08 20:15:26 if you multiply that by 60 to get a minute
bug-reports 2020-02-08 20:15:30 you get 180 mb
bug-reports 2020-02-08 20:15:36 180 mb for a 1 minute video
bug-reports 2020-02-08 20:15:40 of course it'll be too large
bug-reports 2020-02-08 20:16:01 also 100kb is a very small file size for a full image of your screen

creations-chat 2020-03-18 19:34:56 my opinion is that your turrets are too big
creations-chat 2020-03-18 19:35:05 hull is tiny in comparison
creations-chat 2020-03-18 20:55:52 i'm not an expert but i'm pretty sure mazes are supposed to have an end
creations-chat 2020-03-18 20:56:08 well i don't see one
creations-chat 2020-03-18 20:56:38 usually if the end is in the maze then it'd be in the middle
creations-chat 2020-03-18 20:57:51 no it seems like a badly designed maze now that i look at it closely
creations-chat 2020-03-18 20:57:55 the paths don't branch out
creations-chat 2020-03-18 20:58:08 a bad one
creations-chat 2020-03-18 20:59:02 thats what i mean
creations-chat 2020-03-18 20:59:22 99% of the maze is just dead ends that you can see immediately
creations-chat 2020-03-18 20:59:35 instead of spending your time looking at every path to see if they are a dead end
creations-chat 2020-03-18 20:59:49 some parts you cant even reach
creations-chat 2020-03-18 20:59:52 they are enclosed
creations-chat 2020-03-18 21:00:09 and the entire left part of the maze is useless
creations-chat 2020-03-18 21:00:16 because the end is on the right side of the maze
creations-chat 2020-03-18 21:00:22 and there's a clear line down the middle
creations-chat 2020-03-18 21:00:30 so the left part is useless
creations-chat 2020-03-18 21:00:42 because you already have access to the right side of the maze

help 2020-03-18 21:35:11 well if it's a seaplane then you can only get aero
help 2020-03-18 21:35:21 if it's a ship that can fly you can still only get shipwright
help 2020-03-18 21:35:53 depends on how unrecognizable it is
help 2020-03-18 21:35:58 it's still one or the other
help 2020-03-18 21:36:18 otherwise people would get both ranks for a sea plane
help 2020-03-18 21:36:33 you should make a ship for a ship rank and make a plane for an aero rank
help 2020-03-18 21:36:53 making 1 for both would ruin the point of having different kinds of ranks

bug-reports 2020-04-12 08:14:27 you don't know what an update is?
bug-reports 2020-04-12 08:14:30 a bug report?
bug-reports 2020-04-12 08:14:32 a message?
bug-reports 2020-04-12 08:15:23 bug report

creations-chat 2020-04-12 08:54:12 why would he post it after 1 test
creations-chat 2020-04-12 08:54:35 of course he would edit it to be better after playing around with it a few times
creations-chat 2020-04-12 08:55:03 well when did anyone say anything about it being the first time he used the steering system
creations-chat 2020-04-12 08:55:24 he even said he modified it

bug-reports 2020-04-12 08:56:13 admins aren't a part of the game development
bug-reports 2020-04-12 08:56:27 why are you giving bug reports to people who moderate the discord server
bug-reports 2020-04-12 08:56:40 i said the bug is a bug with roblox not with plane crazy <@!463577308947677184>
bug-reports 2020-04-12 08:57:03 how do you expect rickje to fix a bug with roblox itself
bug-reports 2020-04-12 08:57:26 you want him to break into the house of an intern at roblox and modify roblox's game engine?
bug-reports 2020-04-12 08:57:50 cool

the-dump 2020-04-12 09:13:16 ** **
the-dump 2020-04-12 09:13:20 same
the-dump 2020-04-12 09:13:53 first station
the-dump 2020-04-12 09:14:00 it had enough fuel to orbit mun so j
the-dump 2020-04-12 09:15:01 i had my first minmus base up and running within 40 hours of first starting it up
the-dump 2020-04-12 09:15:17 
the-dump 2020-04-12 09:15:27 before landing modules on minmus
the-dump 2020-04-12 09:15:51 minmus easier because gravity
the-dump 2020-04-12 09:16:18 also somehow i still remember what rocket i tried to make when i played ksp demo while i was about 10
the-dump 2020-04-12 09:16:27 idk how but i remember the design
the-dump 2020-04-12 09:16:30 slightly
the-dump 2020-04-12 09:16:53 my first mun rover
the-dump 2020-04-12 09:17:04 
the-dump 2020-04-12 09:17:19 skycrane always epic design
the-dump 2020-04-12 09:17:30 
the-dump 2020-04-12 09:17:59 i remastered it as well
the-dump 2020-04-12 09:18:09 
the-dump 2020-04-12 09:18:31 idk how i should keep my current ksp save file going
the-dump 2020-04-12 09:18:47 i have monthly budget mod installed
the-dump 2020-04-12 09:19:05 i still havent sent living kerbals to the surface of duna yet
the-dump 2020-04-12 09:19:15 i planned an interplanetary ship
the-dump 2020-04-12 09:19:25 but honestly meh
the-dump 2020-04-12 09:19:34 took too much planning
the-dump 2020-04-12 09:19:46 and also ive never lost a kerbal in action before
the-dump 2020-04-12 09:19:50 thats why i plan
the-dump 2020-04-12 09:20:02 only 1 kerbal died and that was due to asphyxiation
the-dump 2020-04-12 09:20:05 stuck in orbit
the-dump 2020-04-12 09:20:10 and it was for a contract
the-dump 2020-04-12 09:20:18 so not really a true kerbal that died
the-dump 2020-04-12 09:21:09 r0ver
the-dump 2020-04-12 09:21:29 i pack too much science onto my stuff
the-dump 2020-04-12 09:21:51 i think i should pack less and just send more satellites instead
the-dump 2020-04-12 09:21:55 would be cooler
the-dump 2020-04-12 09:22:15 
the-dump 2020-04-12 09:22:18 c00l image
the-dump 2020-04-12 09:22:26 maybe

the-dump 2020-04-12 09:23:27 kerbin in SVE isnt too great
the-dump 2020-04-12 09:23:28 but damn
the-dump 2020-04-12 09:23:34 SVE's jool is the best
the-dump 2020-04-12 09:23:35 imo
the-dump 2020-04-12 09:23:50 if only i could mix avp's kerbin and sve's jool
the-dump 2020-04-12 09:23:53 would be perfect
the-dump 2020-04-12 09:24:09 
the-dump 2020-04-12 09:24:31 
the-dump 2020-04-12 09:24:49 j
the-dump 2020-04-12 09:25:25 small
the-dump 2020-04-12 09:25:31 i always build small and compact
the-dump 2020-04-12 09:25:51 but the science i put onto the stuff i send is like half the mass
the-dump 2020-04-12 09:26:13 idk how i should make my duna base
the-dump 2020-04-12 09:26:14 b
the-dump 2020-04-12 09:26:24 i really want a duna base just for the sandstorms
the-dump 2020-04-12 09:26:26 b epic
the-dump 2020-04-12 09:26:40 well i mean design as in
the-dump 2020-04-12 09:26:48 should it be horizontal cylinders
the-dump 2020-04-12 09:26:50 or vertical
the-dump 2020-04-12 09:27:01 or use that mod with the half cylinder type
the-dump 2020-04-12 09:27:09 jjjj
the-dump 2020-04-12 09:27:40 not my image
the-dump 2020-04-12 09:28:20 duna is just too cool not to make a base on
the-dump 2020-04-12 09:28:40 well i installed it when i knew i could handle it
the-dump 2020-04-12 09:28:41 so idk
the-dump 2020-04-12 09:28:47 no difference in fps
the-dump 2020-04-12 09:28:50 cause gpu

creations-chat 2020-04-27 05:38:15 it depends on what kind of ship
creations-chat 2020-04-27 05:38:24 for yachts, all of them have interiors
creations-chat 2020-04-27 05:38:29 warships, almost none of them
creations-chat 2020-04-27 05:43:32 doesn't look like a yacht or a warship to me
creations-chat 2020-04-27 05:43:37 so idk what you mean by 'it'
creations-chat 2020-04-27 05:45:18 yeah i know
creations-chat 2020-04-27 05:45:30 you said 'it' without saying what 'it' is
creations-chat 2020-04-27 05:45:56 so it makes no sense
creations-chat 2020-04-27 05:46:32 'you can see it in my profile picture'
creations-chat 2020-04-27 05:47:02 the only 2 kinds of ships i mentioned were yachts and warships
creations-chat 2020-04-27 05:47:15 therefore those are the only 2 kinds of ships that you can use to assume what 'it' is
creations-chat 2020-04-27 05:47:29 however the ship in your profile picture is neither a yacht or a warship
creations-chat 2020-04-27 05:47:35 therefore it makes no sense
creations-chat 2020-04-27 05:47:44 and i know it's a cruise ship

creations-chat 2020-05-15 02:20:43 <@!368630214747619340> the bot is working as intended
creations-chat 2020-05-15 02:21:03 voxel just decided that there is no need for a bot to post all images to <#384025409945337856> anymore
creations-chat 2020-05-15 02:21:11 can just let people post only images
creations-chat 2020-05-15 02:21:23 so we won't need to use a bot for that again

creations-chat 2020-06-30 05:54:31 yes i know
creations-chat 2020-06-30 05:54:53 but the bell is actually wider than the rocket itself
creations-chat 2020-06-30 05:54:59 in blueprints
creations-chat 2020-06-30 05:55:07 and it isn't as elongated as yours is
creations-chat 2020-06-30 05:56:07 not exactly what i meant
creations-chat 2020-06-30 05:56:23 i meant that the platform would be larger since the bell should be larger as well

the-dump 2020-07-03 08:22:05 and then they decided to enforce the rule heavily because free modlogs
the-dump 2020-07-03 08:22:48 meaning that the rule for no n-word has devolved into mods searching for their next ~~meal~~ modlog in <#495286269459300364> because some people might have forgotten or didn't hear the word in a funny meme they decided to share

the-dump 2020-07-03 08:24:09 cough yousuf
the-dump 2020-07-03 08:24:15 whooping cough
the-dump 2020-07-03 08:24:29 no you didnt
the-dump 2020-07-03 08:24:31 you saw it
the-dump 2020-07-03 08:24:39 <:OmegaTroll:626841385118597152>
the-dump 2020-07-03 08:25:32 maybe some people don't like this server because mods are so focused on warning the moment they see someone break a rule instead of doing what the word 'warning' actually describes
the-dump 2020-07-03 08:26:13 a warning is to warn someone of consequences that will occur if they continue with their behavior
the-dump 2020-07-03 08:26:34 nobody listens because you use actual warnings more than oral warnings
the-dump 2020-07-03 08:26:49 meaning you've made oral warnings lose meaning
the-dump 2020-07-03 08:27:25 doesn't mean you should consider everyone to be like that
the-dump 2020-07-03 08:27:33 if someone ignores oral warnings give them actual warnings
the-dump 2020-07-03 08:28:31 but just because people ignore them doesn't mean everyone does, and if you keep your promise of giving people real warnings after ignoring an oral warning they might consider your next oral warning with more thought
the-dump 2020-07-03 08:28:47 yes but 3 warnings = kick/tempban
the-dump 2020-07-03 08:29:11 an actual warning is more like a super-warning since you get so few chances
the-dump 2020-07-03 08:29:29 3rd strike and you're out
the-dump 2020-07-03 08:29:36 yes because they're new

the-dump 2020-07-03 09:00:21 <@456226577798135808>
the-dump 2020-07-03 09:00:26 did you clone yourself
the-dump 2020-07-03 09:00:47 this is the last time i'm letting you anywhere near my cloning machine
the-dump 2020-07-03 09:01:02 now we have 2 deciduus'es
the-dump 2020-07-03 09:04:07 who that directed at tho
the-dump 2020-07-03 09:04:26 if at world of tanks then you can, just not with the same vehicle
the-dump 2020-07-03 09:05:00 many games to be the subject of abuse here
the-dump 2020-07-03 09:05:23 only for the exact same tank
the-dump 2020-07-03 09:06:14 world of tanks is more comparable to csgo and war thunder is more like battlefield
the-dump 2020-07-03 09:06:26 battlefield has different vehicles etc
the-dump 2020-07-03 09:06:44 csgo is more about competitiveness and russians that swear at you every 5 seconds
the-dump 2020-07-03 09:07:25 world of tanks is not anywhere near the type of experience you get with war thunder just saying
the-dump 2020-07-03 09:07:35 it can be a bit too fast paced at times
the-dump 2020-07-03 09:07:56 no because nobody plays low tiers
the-dump 2020-07-03 09:08:02 except for the occasional seal clubber
the-dump 2020-07-03 09:08:15 so if you're any good at war thunder you will still do excellent
the-dump 2020-07-03 09:08:22 until you hit tier 4/5
the-dump 2020-07-03 09:08:40 yes of course
the-dump 2020-07-03 09:08:49 overmatch mechanics too for arcade purposes
the-dump 2020-07-03 09:09:17 so if you have a 183mm caliber shell you can pen armor of up to 50mm thickness at any angle
the-dump 2020-07-03 09:09:49 overmatch means if your shell caliber is greater than or equal to three times the thickness of the armor you hit, it will pen no matter the angle
the-dump 2020-07-03 09:10:04 so people dont rage at bouncing off an M56 scorpion with a giant shell
the-dump 2020-07-03 09:10:51 though the skill required to continue getting good games past tier 5 really ramps up
the-dump 2020-07-03 09:11:02 at tier 8 you regularly face the best of the best
the-dump 2020-07-03 09:11:25 tier 10 not so much, but usually about the same as tier 8
the-dump 2020-07-03 09:11:26 yes
the-dump 2020-07-03 09:11:51 cause tier 8 has the most vehicles **cough** premium tanks **cough**
the-dump 2020-07-03 09:12:31 no i mean there are more premium tanks than actual tanks you can unlock in the tech tree at tier 8
the-dump 2020-07-03 09:12:42 they've just kept pumping them out
the-dump 2020-07-03 09:12:46 but most are just reskins
the-dump 2020-07-03 09:13:07 so really maybe 1/3 of the total premium tanks are unique
the-dump 2020-07-03 09:13:10 yes
the-dump 2020-07-03 09:13:24 though i grinded for a few months after getting back into the game
the-dump 2020-07-03 09:13:37 got 4 tier 8 tanks
the-dump 2020-07-03 09:14:04 i been playing since 2015 and i hadn't even gotten more than 1 up until i started playing again
the-dump 2020-07-03 09:14:22 well i was extremely young at the time
the-dump 2020-07-03 09:14:32 so i did poorly in battles
the-dump 2020-07-03 09:15:20 ok
the-dump 2020-07-03 09:15:31 some mechanics were changed this update i believe
the-dump 2020-07-03 09:15:43 makes the tank modifications a bit simpler
the-dump 2020-07-03 09:16:13 not tank unlockable modules, just forgot the word for them
the-dump 2020-07-03 09:16:36 equipment 2.0 is what it's called
the-dump 2020-07-03 09:16:48 used to be very expensive
the-dump 2020-07-03 09:17:16 and seal clubbers could make their tank perform like 200% better than new players' tanks
the-dump 2020-07-03 09:17:20 due to being rich
the-dump 2020-07-03 09:17:50 yes
the-dump 2020-07-03 09:17:58 though i just looked it up, it's not in the game yet

bug-reports 2020-08-19 21:55:05 but since there is no frame between those 2, you were never in the ground
bug-reports 2020-08-19 21:55:35 meaning that in 60 physics frames per second, one frame you are above the ground, and the next frame you are below it

creations-chat 2020-08-26 00:25:09 in some places
creations-chat 2020-08-26 00:25:34 H definitely not the same
creations-chat 2020-08-26 00:25:42 but G and F2 are identical
creations-chat 2020-08-26 00:25:47 it is
creations-chat 2020-08-26 00:25:51 its not 80mm
creations-chat 2020-08-26 00:25:54 in some places maybe
creations-chat 2020-08-26 00:26:01 but half the entire front is still the same as the F2
creations-chat 2020-08-26 00:26:23 so they aren't 100% the same but they are 95% the same
creations-chat 2020-08-26 00:26:41 anyways
creations-chat 2020-08-26 00:26:47 the F1 is terrible and the gun looks bad too
creations-chat 2020-08-26 00:26:49 just saying
creations-chat 2020-08-26 00:26:52 F2 looks better
creations-chat 2020-08-26 00:27:11 yeah but ugly

creations-chat 2020-08-26 00:28:50 classic doesnt make a difference if its still 75 years ago
creations-chat 2020-08-26 00:29:09 short gun or long gun on panzer iv?
creations-chat 2020-08-26 00:29:52 F2 is better than the F1
creations-chat 2020-08-26 00:29:58 we know
creations-chat 2020-08-26 00:30:00 we all play
creations-chat 2020-08-26 00:30:09 so long gun or short gun
creations-chat 2020-08-26 00:30:12 long gun is better
creations-chat 2020-08-26 00:31:05 T-34 armor is basically the same as the armor of the panzer iv since guns of both tanks can kill both easily
creations-chat 2020-08-26 00:31:14 yes f2 looks better
creations-chat 2020-08-26 00:31:17 only difference is the gun
creations-chat 2020-08-26 00:31:22 it is cooler

creations-chat 2020-09-24 15:44:56 it takes him hours to set it up most of the time
creations-chat 2020-09-24 15:45:08 third part does not mean exploit
creations-chat 2020-09-24 15:45:14 that's like calling fps unlocker an exploit
creations-chat 2020-09-24 15:45:21 it doesnt exploit anything other than your own pc
creations-chat 2020-09-24 15:45:48 explain the meaning of exploiting
creations-chat 2020-09-24 15:46:36 software vulnerabilities
creations-chat 2020-09-24 15:46:44 it does not exploit a vulnerability in roblox
creations-chat 2020-09-24 15:46:53 it just lets you use multiple instances
creations-chat 2020-09-24 15:47:22 well what mechanic of roblox does he exploit
creations-chat 2020-09-24 15:48:23 there is a difference between using hacks to completely change the game and using more than 2 roblox accounts at once
creations-chat 2020-09-24 15:48:54 also would using the windows version of roblox count as exploiting too
creations-chat 2020-09-24 15:49:08 cause you can download normal roblox and windows store roblox and run them at the same time
creations-chat 2020-09-24 15:49:18 therefore having 2 instances of roblox
creations-chat 2020-09-24 15:49:26 so
creations-chat 2020-09-24 15:49:31 that do be exploiting in your eyes
creations-chat 2020-09-24 15:49:48 stop spam emoj

creations-chat 2020-09-24 15:51:18 <@!430394898726780940> what mechanic does he exploit in roblox
creations-chat 2020-09-24 15:51:46 does roblox state you aren't supposed to have multiple instances
creations-chat 2020-09-24 15:51:52 inventer this is annoying
creations-chat 2020-09-24 15:51:58 please may you stop
creations-chat 2020-09-24 15:52:45 he doesn't actually use a full 10 alts at once if you still think that btw
creations-chat 2020-09-24 15:52:58 and miner lives in a completely different time zone than most people
creations-chat 2020-09-24 15:53:02 unless he was actively typing in chat
creations-chat 2020-09-24 15:54:49 yeah but why do you keep saying 'he exploits' almost as if it were in the same tone as saying 'he hacks'
creations-chat 2020-09-24 15:55:43 it doesn't sound like you think it's harmless cause apparently i'm also making excuses for him
creations-chat 2020-09-24 15:55:58 so why do you think him exploiting would be bad then <@!430394898726780940>
creations-chat 2020-09-24 15:56:13 no that's not really 'all you're saying'
creations-chat 2020-09-24 15:56:20 you completely implied it using your words
creations-chat 2020-09-24 15:56:43 'he doesnt want to admit he is exploiting' 'idk if you are making excuses for him' etc etc

creations-chat 2020-09-24 17:10:45 ive played both for 6 years and wt is realism but not as fun
creations-chat 2020-09-24 17:11:12 i dont play arcade
creations-chat 2020-09-24 17:11:37 if i want arcade i play wot, i play wt only on ground rb
creations-chat 2020-09-24 17:12:35 yes it make sense but less fun for me not the spotting mechanics btw
creations-chat 2020-09-24 17:14:10 imagine having naval but nobody plays it amirite
creations-chat 2020-09-24 17:14:41 imo wows is definitely better cause huge gigantic ships probably shouldn't be controlled by only 1 player in wt naval
creations-chat 2020-09-24 17:15:21 well arty prob shouldnt be in the game anymore honestly idk
creations-chat 2020-09-24 17:16:10 i mean

creations-chat 2020-09-24 17:19:32 well i mean what about health bars of people 😎
creations-chat 2020-09-24 17:19:50 not trying to argue btw
creations-chat 2020-09-24 17:20:42 a lot of games actually have that
creations-chat 2020-09-24 17:21:01 i mean a shot to the head is basically just 'Crew Knocked Out'
creations-chat 2020-09-24 17:22:33 in roblox there are a couple of games with that, also im pretty sure the older rainbow six games as well as arma and dayz having them
creations-chat 2020-09-24 17:23:07 it depends on how much adrenaline you have, you probably won't feel anything until you have more than a few bullets in your body

creations-chat 2020-09-30 08:20:15 ok and
creations-chat 2020-09-30 08:21:02 using hyperbole in the opposite direction could make sense if at least 1 person *didn't* hate it

creations-chat 2020-09-30 08:21:56 therefore, since most of the people I know either hate it or haven't given their opinion on it, I can use hyperbole safely
creations-chat 2020-09-30 08:22:25 you spelled argument wrong <:PauseChamp:670868208588423168>

the-dump 2020-10-07 08:29:09 paypal thing
creations-chat 2020-10-07 08:39:02 <@!712743154763300864> looks very german
creations-chat 2020-10-07 08:39:34 the turrets also seem excessively large for the thin width of the ship
creations-chat 2020-10-07 08:42:57 the main reason why battleships don't have torpedo tubes is because they will only be fighting at large distances, meaning those torpedoes would be useless and just dead weight in most circumstances
creations-chat 2020-10-07 08:45:27 i mean that's why you have secondaries tho
creations-chat 2020-10-07 08:46:21 if you have 2 armaments for only medium/close range, why not just have 1 type instead
creations-chat 2020-10-07 08:47:18 most nations used to have 8 different gun sizes on their battleships, where a single ship could have a 12 inch gun, a 10 inch gun, a 9 inch, 8 inch, then some 6 inch guns, and so on
creations-chat 2020-10-07 08:47:42 but that was just too much, so they eventually trimmed it down to a primary armament and secondary guns
creations-chat 2020-10-07 08:50:22 if the ship were surrounded then it's not going to make a difference cause if the enemy has surrounded you with multiple well armed vessels, you're already dead; however if the enemy has multiple small and less equipped vessels, it still won't matter because it's harder to hit a smaller target with torpedoes
creations-chat 2020-10-07 08:50:57 only possible way that torpedoes could be useful on a battleship is as a last-ditch weapon to take out as many of the surrounding ships as possible before sinking
creations-chat 2020-10-07 08:52:06 also having 'as many guns as you can fit on a ship' is not the greatest idea because trying to find an accurate range for your specific gun is going to be hard when all the shell splashes are so similar

the-dump 2020-10-09 08:22:31 looks like much effort to pick out the letters for lyrics of the song
creations-chat 2020-10-09 08:23:00 well probably not cause motor2 suspension is more like tank suspension than regular car suspension <@!212321688287838209>
creations-chat 2020-10-09 08:23:18 motor2 suspension might take more space, depends on how you would use it though
creations-chat 2020-10-09 08:25:32 the cylinders make it so they arent connected to the chassis, meaning that they can freely spin like ball bearings and act like motors <@!531903658011394058>

creations-chat 2020-10-09 16:57:24 we shouldn't try to restrict access to people who just started playing the game
creations-chat 2020-10-09 16:57:45 otherwise it will create an even more elitist attitude in most people like some people in <#544722974574379021> have
creations-chat 2020-10-09 16:58:47 yeah but if you join and find out there is no <#384025409945337856> channel, first thing people will do is post their creations in <#384025409945337856> instead cause they think that's where they should be
creations-chat 2020-10-09 16:59:11 ok
creations-chat 2020-10-09 16:59:29 but that means they can still react then
creations-chat 2020-10-09 17:00:08 it's too much hassle for some things that 1% of the community complains about
creations-chat 2020-10-09 17:00:45 the only time troll downvotes were ever a large problem was when puri got downvoted in <#609381270237216768>
creations-chat 2020-10-09 17:01:57 they still have to write the reason as to why the change was made, and to explain to newcomers how to get a rank, and also make people not ask 'HOW DO I POST IN <#384025409945337856> ??? every 5 seconds
creations-chat 2020-10-09 17:02:14 that will take an hour or two, minimum
creations-chat 2020-10-09 17:02:40 people would get confused for like the first week or two
creations-chat 2020-10-09 17:03:01 it's not even worth it to add it
creations-chat 2020-10-09 17:03:18 why is it worth it, explain
creations-chat 2020-10-09 17:04:33 so basically 'wow these people keep posting!!why are you posting!! dont post! you are blocking everyone from upvoting me and giving me 500 upvotes!'
creations-chat 2020-10-09 17:04:53 if a creation is any good in the first place, people will scroll to it and upvote
creations-chat 2020-10-09 17:05:35 yeah, some
creations-chat 2020-10-09 17:05:51 not 80% of the community though
creations-chat 2020-10-09 17:06:50 this thing is still getting upvotes even though it takes 10 seconds of straight scrolling just to get to it
creations-chat 2020-10-09 17:07:57 nobody analyzes everything, people usually look at a creation for 1-2 seconds maximum before deciding whether they want to upvote or not

creations-chat 2020-10-11 21:03:20 also add some disconnector blocks to look like hatches or indents in the armor cause it just looks too undetailed atm
creations-chat 2020-10-11 21:04:34 also those rear spare wheels are too tall
creations-chat 2020-10-11 21:05:15 ik but when you put them on the back they are tall
creations-chat 2020-10-11 21:05:45 no i want you to make something that doesn't look awful
creations-chat 2020-10-11 21:06:25 you can just remove the top cylinder on the spare wheels to make them look less tall
creations-chat 2020-10-11 21:07:08 use ladders and disconnectors right behind the casemate to add some detail there

creations-chat 2020-10-13 16:37:25 ok but when did i think pog was funny
creations-chat 2020-10-13 16:37:49 are you that mentally disabled where you think everyone else is serious but only you can understand the concept of sarcasm
creations-chat 2020-10-13 16:39:30 nobody uses /s in discord because (hopefully) everyone is smart enough to understand a joke so that nobody has to type those 2 things every time they try making a single comedy
creations-chat 2020-10-13 16:40:09 refer to my original statement where i implied that you think everyone is serious and that only sarcasm can be understood by yourself
creations-chat 2020-10-13 16:40:31 i never thought pog by itself was funny so there you go
creations-chat 2020-10-13 16:40:57 alright so you cant think of anything to say other than 'shut the fuck up'
creations-chat 2020-10-13 16:41:14 yu'roe
creations-chat 2020-10-13 16:41:34 you're the one sending videos that nobody wants to watch

creations-chat 2020-10-13 16:43:23 no i mean you said 'at least it's funnier than calling a song cringe and insulting me'
creations-chat 2020-10-13 16:43:39 implying that you think that me insulting you was actually funny in some way
creations-chat 2020-10-13 16:44:03 no thanks
creations-chat 2020-10-13 16:44:23 cause you're kind of awful at this and this is very cool and funny
creations-chat 2020-10-13 16:44:41 it's just a motor glitching out so you don't need any help with that
creations-chat 2020-10-13 16:45:02 i would judge you harder if it was erika
creations-chat 2020-10-13 16:45:47 ok i assume you really just dont need help with your issue then
creations-chat 2020-10-13 16:46:22 and also it is all just an opinion and if you get that worked up over me calling music cringe you should consider getting a life

creations-chat 2020-10-13 20:33:13 some of them aren't the tank but i only used 103 as key term because some people use stridsvagn instead of strv

creations-chat 2020-10-13 20:34:02 stridsvagn not stridsvagen

help 2020-10-16 17:32:41 i mean
help 2020-10-16 17:32:45 if you rotate the tail wing
help 2020-10-16 17:32:48 and rotate it back
help 2020-10-16 17:32:51 its aerodynamics will change
help 2020-10-16 17:33:02 might as well always keep it in the normal rotated position
help 2020-10-16 17:33:14 so you can use lock
help 2020-10-16 17:33:17 and it will never move
help 2020-10-16 17:33:34 the plane is designed to fly like that
help 2020-10-16 17:33:42 do you not know what lock does
help 2020-10-16 17:33:56 it locks and prevents the motor from moving when you arent trying to move it
help 2020-10-16 17:34:23 what
help 2020-10-16 17:34:26 he moves it in position
help 2020-10-16 17:34:27 then
help 2020-10-16 17:34:30 he stops moving it

help 2020-10-16 17:34:45 how
help 2020-10-16 17:34:53 that's what lock was designed for
help 2020-10-16 17:34:57 like

help 2020-10-16 17:37:09 what do you mean turning
help 2020-10-16 17:37:22 yeah but it's locked
help 2020-10-16 17:37:28 are you moving the wings while you're turning?
help 2020-10-16 17:37:34 it should only move the elevators
help 2020-10-16 17:37:44 unless your keybinds are set to those tilting motors as well
help 2020-10-16 17:38:07 like it physically cannot move unless you are pressing it
help 2020-10-16 17:38:27 which motor is locked
help 2020-10-16 17:38:37 not the elevator right?
help 2020-10-16 17:39:01 also are both sides locked
help 2020-10-16 17:39:08 ok
help 2020-10-16 17:39:30 so you hold L for 1 second
help 2020-10-16 17:39:32 then let go

help 2020-10-23 08:28:18 > Well... It's complicated to explain it but to resume you need to place a motor with 0 maxtorque, and place half blocks or half wedges in front of it, where the grey part of the motor points. Then you repeat it right next to it but the motor pointing at the opposite side with the flat part of the motor glued into the last half thing you placed. Repeat until the end.
<@!468897956104503306>  you don't need to have 0 torque, just unpower the motors
creations-chat 2020-10-23 08:30:26 shouldn't the big wheels be bigger? <@456226577798135808>

creations-chat 2020-11-01 08:14:55 kind of depends on what your definition of average is
public server average is more like extremely below average for most regular people

creations-chat 2020-11-01 08:25:19 that was downvoted because it's pretty blocky and even though spheres are hard to make, he could have at least tried adding wedges instead of making it look like it came out of minecraft
creations-chat 2020-11-01 08:28:02 he did get 20 upvotes and 25 downvotes, at least it wasn't 50 full downvotes, just means some people liked it and some people did not
also not many people take into consideration whether a build even functions or not, just how it looks
creations-chat 2020-11-01 08:29:31 well 24 people thought it was bad and 19 people thought it was good, it's their opinion <@693167382222471190>
creations-chat 2020-11-01 08:36:09 well if you're 'not too sure' then the almost 50/50 distribution of upvotes and downvotes align with your opinion
creations-chat 2020-11-01 08:37:17 well i got more upvotes with 1/10 of the effort so i agree

creations-chat 2022-10-14 15:23:55 rules are simply tools mods use to ban people
creations-chat 2022-10-14 15:27:03 the way he put it isnt right, its not allowed to be discussed because it is controversial and thus will just cause arguments (also because the other game apparently copied from plane crazy so <:clueless:942802644043464734> )
creations-chat 2022-10-14 15:30:07 so you're gonna assume that its just the fact that they are building games which makes them copies?
instead of having common sense and thinking the copied part might be a bit more in depth 💀

creations-chat 2022-12-09 01:26:52 taking a picture of a model in 3d will add distortion so you need to reduce the width/increase the height of your roblox game window in order to reduce FOV so that you get a more accurate perspective
creations-chat 2022-12-09 01:29:52 just remember that all pics taken without modifications to your roblox game will have distortion and hence that's why you'll never be 100% accurate if you compare 3d to 2d
but you can get pretty close so honestly whatever

and that was in late 2019
