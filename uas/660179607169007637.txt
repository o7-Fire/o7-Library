creations-chat 2022-05-29 11:06:55 The more you play plane crazy the less you like others peoples builds
creations-chat 2022-05-29 11:10:36 People just need to stop complaining instead of giving criticism and let people build
creations-chat 2022-05-29 11:51:51 No, no it isnt. instead of complaining about bad builds, "you guys make me want to jump off a bridge" you should just give honest, well thought out critism to help the player become better, and not just whine about people having fun at the game
creations-chat 2022-05-29 11:54:48 just be a better fucker next time
creations-chat 2022-05-29 11:58:33 someone decent in PCC?? its truly a rare sight
creations-chat 2022-05-29 12:01:14 opinion on new players who seek critism in <#384025409945337856>?
creations-chat 2022-05-29 12:04:38 i swear to god almost every plane crazy "pro" who harasses new players builds pretend like they built like that when they started
creations-chat 2022-05-29 12:07:30 oh sorry if you thought i aimed it at *him* i was trying to add something onto  his sentence
creations-chat 2022-05-29 12:10:49 your mom has a skill issue
creations-chat 2022-05-29 12:14:30 this server is truly awfull for new players, its just better to start your own community with friends anyways
creations-chat 2022-05-29 12:18:39 sorry about that man, toxic parents can easily ruin a child
creations-chat 2022-05-29 12:23:46 I remember, i had this great friend who'd i play plane crazy with alot, we talked we voice chatted, but then he met Just Rens, i was really happy for him, but then he started hanging out with the plane crazy big boy club, he started playing in exclusive private servers, and we stopped talking to each other, he changed alot, maybe not for the better
creations-chat 2022-05-29 12:29:31 you can also use disconnecters instead of tnt for motor locking tho, i think
creations-chat 2022-05-29 12:47:55 happens to the best of us
creations-chat 2022-05-29 19:10:00 when plane crazy elitism
creations-chat 2022-05-29 19:27:07 i already cope with your mom every night
creations-chat 2022-05-29 19:31:29 <:OmegaTroll:626841385118597152>
creations-chat 2022-05-29 19:35:49 maybe try coping about the fact some people can't build as good as the experts
creations-chat 2022-05-29 19:41:43 most experts lack a thrill in life, or lack a life at all and are usually glued to their pc's and they harass new players to cope with it, its a beautiful self denial
creations-chat 2022-05-29 19:44:56 yes, yes i am, i never said experts were bad in creations. im just talking about losers harassing people completely ignoring the fact they used to suck at the game when they started
creations-chat 2022-05-29 19:49:38 yeah im generalising them because the people who i have met on here who harass new players all have some form of expert, and you are using me *potentionally* posting bad builds in creations as an argument, while its so irrelevent and has not happend
creations-chat 2022-05-29 19:54:40 i suppose so, like i said, im talking from my own experience, alot of people here are just annoying, i also dont really wanna judge people, it's more an useless humbling wake up call, because i thrive off arguments <:OmegaTroll:626841385118597152>
creations-chat 2022-05-29 19:57:23 your build is awesome man, dont let the idiots get to you (<:trollface:775024642104229898> )
creations-chat 2022-05-29 19:59:53 i'm not, he's way better then me ðŸ˜•
creations-chat 2022-05-29 20:02:34 its hard to realise some sentences are jokes, right?
creations-chat 2022-05-29 20:05:14 complaining, just like all the experts when a build they deem is not good enough gets a majority of upvotes <:trollface:775024642104229898>
creations-chat 2022-05-29 20:08:27 i mean i dont really think the community sucks, it got some bad people but i've talked to some nice people hear, and im not really a troll, you are just assuming i am because of my joke, but hey, what can i do about it, i just called someone out on complaining on someones build, everyone thinks trolling is something else i guess
creations-chat 2022-05-29 20:13:27 nah never, but calling me a lowlife scum because i argued complaining about honestly decent builds isnt really contributing anything to yourself nor the builder, but hey, *it is what it is* ill cya around in my next argument with someone with an expert rank and a pfp that has something to do with military stuff, tell your mother i love her
creations-chat 2022-05-29 20:17:14 Yeah, thatâ€™s why Chris posted in it, I also love the gif, and the pfp is yet again a joke, have a great night, Iâ€™m sure you guys are nice people ðŸ‘‹
creations-chat 2022-05-29 20:21:01 (The pope does love kids)
creations-chat 2022-05-29 20:28:15 Yeah itâ€™s genuinely an amazing build, can we please give Chris expert ?
creations-chat 2022-06-05 08:56:29 <@456226577798135808> How'd you get the quality so high?
