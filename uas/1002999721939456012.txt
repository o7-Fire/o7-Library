creations-chat 2023-01-21 21:44:19 when your creation gets 3 downvotes already you know you are doomed
creations-chat 2023-01-21 22:21:34 like this man natorfu puts downvote the second i post my building lol
creations-chat 2023-01-22 23:47:25 i think plane crazy community needs to lower their standards, while people appreciate critics maybe people could  be a little more empathic with new users, not everything needs to be the god of motorlocks and details to look good, i know motorlocking is good for adding details and that but people need to appreciate buildings that dont have motorlock at all, its like a requirement to get upvotes, not everyone can make hyper realistic buildings and i know there are simplistic but good buildings that get upvotes, like for new people its a little sad getting 90 downvotes when posting their best (at least for them) buildings.
creations-chat 2023-01-22 23:58:57 but, i mean, i see really good builds here that get so much downvotes, not the best but they look really fine to me, and people can never think about something that isnt skill issue
creations-chat 2023-01-23 00:02:00 but look, this is my bus, its not the best building of plane crazy but it looks fine, it got all the details it could get as a motorlock noob
creations-chat 2023-01-23 00:04:59 i said all the detail i could as a motorlock NOOB, it even has windshield cleaners that work!
creations-chat 2023-01-23 00:07:28 and it looks alright
creations-chat 2023-01-23 00:11:09 so you are coming with the roscale argument?
