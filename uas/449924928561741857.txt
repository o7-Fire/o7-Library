bug-reports 2020-08-05 15:36:52 My capsule is in the air, not moving, it doesn't have a anchor block. The second stage that it was attached to had one though.
It also had ballast tanks, but I'm assuming those only work in water. So maybe it's a bug, maybe not

help 2020-09-03 11:09:00 Thank you
help 2020-12-01 21:01:46 Hello! So i have some problems with a rocket I made.
When I launch it without turning it, it launches straight. It only turns in the direction, but I like that
This way it can fly across the map

To allow it to fly to the sea, i made it able to turn around it's axis in the launch path.

But here's the thing. When I don't rotate it around its axis, it turns in one direction only. But when I rotate it before launch, it also turns to tis right during flight.

Since there's no wind in the game, I find this really weird

Also when I put my rocket on the ground, it doesn't perfectly fit in the holder I made, but when I roll the rocket to both sides, it suddenly does.

It's very weird, and I was wondering if anyone can help with this.
help 2020-12-01 21:35:03 Motors
help 2020-12-01 21:35:07 They are locked
help 2020-12-01 21:35:19 It cant roll during flight
help 2020-12-01 21:35:29 The motor is part of the launch path
help 2020-12-01 21:40:12 Is there any way to solve it?
help 2020-12-01 21:41:35 The entire thing, or around the motors?
help 2020-12-01 22:02:59 Idk if there will be more responses but if so Imma ready them tomorrow
help 2020-12-01 22:03:10 Thank you guys for your help! I appreciate it :D
