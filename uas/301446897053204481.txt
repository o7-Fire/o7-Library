creations-chat 2019-01-02 14:53:12 my latest fighter starcraftfan2
Yes I know this has been shown but it has modifications to help performance at high and low speed
creations-chat 2019-01-02 14:53:13 
creations-chat 2019-01-02 15:06:27 should I post the video of it?
creations-chat 2019-01-02 15:09:59 I would ask but nah this is a roblox game after all
creations-chat 2019-01-02 15:12:24 here's the video of it flying
creations-chat 2019-01-02 15:13:05 Or I will need to make it into a gif BRB...
creations-chat 2019-02-22 01:02:53 New speedy bio
creations-chat 2019-02-22 01:03:41 level flight also
creations-chat 2019-02-23 01:43:39 gees....
creations-chat 2019-02-23 01:47:07 Super fast and hyper maneuverable.
creations-chat 2019-02-23 01:49:21 It can cobra manuever
creations-chat 2019-03-09 17:03:51 Mustang
creations-chat 2019-03-09 17:04:25 Custom gear also
creations-chat 2019-03-09 17:24:39 Hard to make one look like a proper mustang without going giant.
creations-chat 2019-03-09 17:26:41 If I was easily offended I shouldn't be on the internet Lol.
creations-chat 2019-03-09 17:29:52 But hey it is still fast and turns well.
creations-chat 2019-03-09 17:30:08 Well fast when the prop pitch is just right...
creations-chat 2019-03-09 17:31:34 It ranges from 260 to 407 for top speed level flight...
creations-chat 2019-03-15 17:31:30 Made it faster....
creations-chat 2019-04-15 23:09:33 What do you guys think?
creations-chat 2019-04-15 23:16:37 So good? or does that default back down to a two?
creations-chat 2019-04-15 23:16:57 LMAO
creations-chat 2019-04-15 23:17:01 thanks man.
creations-chat 2019-04-15 23:17:08 Flies as well as she looks.
creations-chat 2019-04-15 23:18:04 It can fly inverted too.
creations-chat 2019-04-17 01:19:13 354 parts for this bugger
creations-chat 2019-04-17 01:19:13 
creations-chat 2019-04-17 01:19:54 It flies well too.
creations-chat 2019-04-17 01:20:00 615 speed
creations-chat 2019-04-17 01:20:07 Turns on a dime without engines.
creations-chat 2019-04-17 01:20:14 Used no turning thrust.
creations-chat 2019-04-17 01:21:00 Agreed feel cheaty. For a fighter you just need to learn how to control wing loading to increase turn rate.
creations-chat 2019-04-17 01:21:19 Which is pretty easy actually.
creations-chat 2019-04-17 01:21:29 just add wing slats
creations-chat 2019-04-17 01:21:42 which is what the leading edge of my wing has.
creations-chat 2019-04-17 01:22:16 Not wing me what you see is all you see.
creations-chat 2019-04-17 01:22:22 with*
creations-chat 2019-04-17 01:22:43 if you want you can check this plane out in a server.
creations-chat 2019-04-17 01:22:54 I hang out in PVP most the time.
creations-chat 2019-04-17 01:23:14 Well I am a murder machine builder.
creations-chat 2019-04-17 01:23:53 Oh I know. I balance my planes rather.
creations-chat 2019-04-17 01:24:02 When I cant I add trim tabs.
creations-chat 2019-04-17 01:24:40 I never use any engines except for forward force I use wing surfaces on motors to trim.
creations-chat 2019-04-17 01:24:55 And it works always.
creations-chat 2019-04-17 01:25:12 Feel free.
creations-chat 2019-04-17 01:25:30 As long as you don't steal what makes my planes really op. Which I never share.
creations-chat 2019-04-17 01:25:51 But honestly I am just a good pilot that is what makes mine good.
creations-chat 2019-04-17 01:26:17 I play a lot of combat flight sims like DCS.
creations-chat 2019-04-17 01:26:39 Oh this also has a ejection seat.
creations-chat 2019-04-17 01:27:08 Yeah I agree.
creations-chat 2019-04-17 01:27:24 Same here.
creations-chat 2019-04-17 01:27:47 Nope...
creations-chat 2019-04-17 01:28:19 Oh those do affect lift aerodynamics I don't know but if you turn it will affect thrust vector thus causing wing stall.
creations-chat 2019-04-17 01:28:59 Well not thrust vector but velocity vector.
creations-chat 2019-04-17 01:29:06 Thrust is different.
creations-chat 2019-06-12 13:53:26 This is a little too good at cleaning PVP servers.
creations-chat 2019-07-05 01:02:25 Speedy.
creations-chat 2019-07-10 03:36:39 Base runner
creations-chat 2019-07-10 03:52:07 Thanks.
creations-chat 2019-07-29 01:02:17 Folded
creations-chat 2019-07-29 01:02:18 
creations-chat 2019-07-29 03:49:08 No magnets involved in this.
creations-chat 2019-07-31 22:40:44 I did it I made a single engine aircraft run with only motors.
creations-chat 2019-07-31 22:41:09 only counteracting force is two control surfaces.
creations-chat 2019-07-31 22:45:11 here's my proof.
creations-chat 2019-07-31 22:49:37 check my rank.
creations-chat 2019-07-31 22:49:42 I've done this stuff before.
creations-chat 2019-07-31 22:51:06 also it tops out at 400.
creations-chat 2019-07-31 22:51:12 in level flight.
creations-chat 2019-08-17 20:32:45 So I made a p-51 so here's a 262.
creations-chat 2019-08-17 20:32:46 
creations-chat 2019-09-21 21:16:14 I have made a discovery
creations-chat 2019-09-21 21:16:51 We can make wing stats now.
creations-chat 2019-09-21 21:21:18 They are used to help when a aircraft is near a stall by pushing air over the wing. But in place crazies case it just adds directional lift when you climb.
creations-chat 2019-10-06 02:51:17 Ornithopter
creations-chat 2019-10-06 02:51:21 
creations-chat 2019-10-06 02:51:50 
creations-chat 2019-10-06 16:45:46 dragon ornithopter.
creations-chat 2019-11-01 19:22:03 So I made a super fast fighter design.
creations-chat 2019-11-01 19:22:58 it uses cutters to smooth the shape.
creations-chat 2019-11-01 19:23:15 it's only two blocks tall 1 block center half blocks on either side.
creations-chat 2019-11-01 19:37:09 My ranked thing is due to a complex story from before the current ranks.
bug-reports 2019-11-14 23:36:10 In pvp when I press the fire key my rockets only fire when I am holding still.
bug-reports 2019-11-14 23:36:19 What's going on?
creations-chat 2019-11-15 01:46:25 Flea L.A.V. (light assault vehicle)
creations-chat 2019-11-15 01:46:37 
bug-reports 2019-11-16 16:52:58 So umm any ideas on how to fix the pvp rocket launching bug for me. I can't fire when I move but when I am stationary they launch.
bug-reports 2019-11-16 17:37:52 I can't exactly record it.
bug-reports 2019-11-16 17:38:18 And it had no errors show up whenever I shoot rockets so I am confused.
bug-reports 2019-11-16 17:40:07 directly after I fire and they are not lagging behind.
bug-reports 2019-11-16 17:40:34 they just leave the rack and vanish without a trace for a minute respawning on the rack.
bug-reports 2019-11-16 21:37:37 no they don't trail I always check each time they just don't spawn from the launcher.
bug-reports 2019-11-16 21:40:05 Also I should add this has been going on for weeks it just finally got annoying enough that I had to report it.
bug-reports 2019-11-17 00:07:36 seems the bug is fixed now.
help 2019-11-17 02:06:37 So how do you make it so your tank doesn't freeze upon spawning when the body is anchored the turret works when not the whole creation freezes. Same without anchor block.
help 2019-11-17 02:13:41 It's just stuck like this without an anchor block.
help 2019-11-17 02:14:30 when I leave the seat it works apparently...
help 2019-11-17 02:16:01 fixed it i had to use a secondary seat.
help 2019-11-17 02:16:08 nvm...
help 2019-11-17 02:18:59 Well I have to sit in the turret no riding in the actual cabin.
creations-chat 2020-03-01 22:16:11 So I made a hovercraft already.
creations-chat 2020-03-01 22:16:12 
creations-chat 2020-03-01 22:16:48 It's so hard to get a good angle on it.
creations-chat 2020-03-02 23:04:42 
creations-chat 2020-03-02 23:04:42 Upgraded the hovership
creations-chat 2020-03-02 23:05:41 Looks good huh?

creations-chat 2020-03-11 18:37:35 So we got a high detail and fully motorized 109. flies via 1 motor stack. with 5 stages.
creations-chat 2020-03-11 20:30:57 Not bad.
creations-chat 2020-03-11 22:04:19 Further upgraded hovercraft.
creations-chat 2020-03-11 22:04:20 
creations-chat 2020-03-11 22:05:42 What kind of angle top down?
creations-chat 2020-03-11 22:07:01 Because it's hard to get a angle on this thing that shows it all since it has a lot off little stuff for a little build.
bug-reports 2020-03-13 21:43:12 Any idea what's going on with the guns? They keep not working server side. Client is just fine just nothing server side.
bug-reports 2020-03-14 17:19:46 To share what's going on. We are not shooting the red tracer and this happens when someone fires and their red tracers don't despawn.

creations-chat 2020-05-26 18:47:14 So I might of overdone it with the cockpit but it looks sweet
creations-chat 2020-05-26 18:47:15 
creations-chat 2020-05-26 18:47:16 
creations-chat 2020-05-26 18:47:42 The flaps work too.
creations-chat 2020-05-26 18:47:49 
creations-chat 2020-05-26 18:47:49 
creations-chat 2020-05-26 18:48:08 Also has a ejection seat.
creations-chat 2020-05-26 18:48:25 Enough to boost turn rate enough to actually survive low speed dogfighting.
creations-chat 2020-05-26 18:49:19 Springs on the canopy and the seat with a parachute on the back of the sat.
creations-chat 2020-05-26 18:49:21 seat*
creations-chat 2020-05-26 18:50:02 As close as I can get and have everything clear that makes it work.
creations-chat 2020-05-26 18:51:10 It's pretty funny because most people never expect it when they somehow glue themselves to my six. Only when I let them honestly and I pop the canopy and smack them with it.
creations-chat 2020-05-26 18:52:00 I like the whole ejection seat adds to the realism this isn't WWII anymore you don't bail you blast out of the jet.
creations-chat 2020-05-26 18:52:40 Speaking of which I have a overly complex motor powered 109...
creations-chat 2020-05-26 18:54:01 Somehow this mess becomes a 109
creations-chat 2020-05-26 18:54:02 
creations-chat 2020-05-26 18:54:09 
creations-chat 2020-05-26 18:54:28 Talk about transformers right Lol
creations-chat 2020-05-26 18:54:34 Also flies at 430 speed.
creations-chat 2020-05-26 18:55:16 well most just allow for smooth looks trim or flaps. And 5 run the engine.
creations-chat 2020-05-26 18:55:42 and 4 for prop pitch.
creations-chat 2020-05-26 18:56:14 Oh it also has mechanized wing slats.
creations-chat 2020-05-26 18:56:49 It has everything the 109 k4 had.
creations-chat 2020-05-26 18:57:39 I'm just happy it can actually fly lol.
creations-chat 2020-05-26 18:58:20 After all it has 34 motors on it in total.
creations-chat 2020-05-26 18:58:26 Wait 36
creations-chat 2020-05-26 18:58:33 no 37...
creations-chat 2020-05-26 18:58:39 It has to many motors
creations-chat 2020-05-26 18:58:46 And I missed 2 more 39
creations-chat 2020-05-26 19:01:31 And don't forget to bring the torque to max or it will wobble.
creations-chat 2020-06-05 14:10:18 heard you like high angles of attack so I put of AoA on your AoA
creations-chat 2020-06-05 14:11:37 But all jokes aside this thing pulls 50 AoA...
creations-chat 2020-06-06 17:26:18 You got a HOLE in your RIGHT wing!
creations-chat 2020-06-06 17:31:20 Oh and it turns like a 109 at low speed now. Aka always flat spinning.
creations-chat 2020-06-06 17:34:38 Might as well be but it makes it hard to aim when your always fighting your tendency to flat spin. Also doesn't help that this is a angle of attack fighter. So when I can't pull hard anymore I am already dead.
the-dump 2020-06-15 20:17:56 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-NeHGFCAXQ
creations-chat 2020-07-01 23:55:27 How to 109
creations-chat 2020-07-16 22:34:17 Got that nice high angle wing sweep with wing slats.
creations-chat 2020-07-16 22:36:43 Yeah that's actually a real thing that happens when things speed up.
creations-chat 2020-07-16 22:36:57 Well rotation that is...
creations-chat 2020-07-25 15:51:19 Somehow I haven't stalled this deltawing jet...
help 2020-08-15 16:32:35 It's connected to a block at the bottom.
help 2020-08-15 16:32:53 That's keeping it from moving.
help 2020-08-15 16:33:19 No the other side of the spring.
help 2020-08-15 16:34:00 Keep the motor where it is. The blocks level with the motor shouldn't connect to the spring.
help 2020-08-15 16:34:42 One sec...
help 2020-08-15 16:35:19 Gonna make a simple suspension the send the picture here.
help 2020-08-15 16:36:10 This is how it should look.
creations-chat 2020-08-21 15:40:12 Welp I did it I made a 109 with a compact side open canopy.
creations-chat 2020-09-03 01:11:05 hows this for a 450 part jet's stall speed and angle?
creations-chat 2020-09-03 01:11:58 Oh and it's a overly complex adf-01 falken build...
creations-chat 2020-09-03 01:12:33 
creations-chat 2020-09-03 01:12:33 Motor locks Eh?
creations-chat 2020-09-03 01:13:21 true dat
creations-chat 2020-09-03 01:15:24 Got nough tnt there?
creations-chat 2020-09-03 01:16:06 I see.
creations-chat 2020-09-03 01:16:47 Nice...
creations-chat 2020-09-03 01:17:26 Oh and the gun drops down too. Which took way to much time to make work.
creations-chat 2020-09-03 01:18:31 Yeah tbh.
creations-chat 2020-09-03 01:18:48 Would be more usable than the guns or rockets too.
creations-chat 2020-09-03 01:19:51 
creations-chat 2020-09-03 01:19:51 Over engineered f-15 is over engineered.
creations-chat 2020-09-03 01:21:02 Also comes with a ejection seat.
bug-reports 2020-10-09 15:32:28 My firework projectiles refuse to spawn in front of my craft unless I am stationary, anyone know what that's about?
bug-reports 2020-10-09 16:23:04 I watched it seems like a bug. The projectiles once I start moving have the opposite speed of my vehicle. The projectiles go backwards when i start moving.
help 2021-09-14 20:00:25 Any have a clue why my rockets are spawning a good 200 blocks behind me when I am moving?
help 2021-09-14 20:02:14 Any possible solutions?
help 2021-09-14 20:03:10 Dang
help 2021-09-14 20:04:08 Mainly asked because it flared up after a update some time back and well. Can't get snapshots anymore.
help 2021-09-14 20:04:55 Anywhere between post stall to 1k. Any speed I get them spawning behind me.
help 2021-09-14 20:05:23 Unless stationary
creations-chat 2022-02-17 00:29:23 
creations-chat 2022-02-17 00:31:25 You want to see the whole thing?
creations-chat 2022-02-17 00:34:24 total of 4 surfaces on the wing dedicated to countering torque with a total of 250 RPM on the engine from a five stack engine. With trimmable aerilons. Would do six stack but engine goes kraken past 260. And That's easy to reach in a dive so... No six stack.
creations-chat 2022-02-17 00:40:43 Danke
