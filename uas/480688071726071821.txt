plane-crazy 2020-03-17 18:18:20 <@!615356321340063784> Yeah I see what you meant now, but as I said before I don't think that could be done (because you wouldn't want to park a spacecraft that uses nuclear bombs for propulsion near anything
plane-crazy 2020-03-17 18:16:51 crap just pinned myself lol
plane-crazy 2020-03-17 18:16:41 <@!480688071726071821> Oh I see what you meant now

plane-crazy 2020-03-17 18:12:26 <@!615356321340063784> I mean an Orion spacecraft is very clumsy (it uses nuclear bombs to move so yeah) so you wouldn't want to park near anything (that includes your station)
plane-crazy 2020-03-17 18:10:12 <@!615356321340063784> Anyway what I wanted to say is that normally you would use the small shuttles on my ship to transfer people and resources between a station and the ship
plane-crazy 2020-03-17 18:08:15 Oh nice
plane-crazy 2020-03-17 18:07:56 Yeah
plane-crazy 2020-03-17 18:07:29 Technically a nuclear reactor would need radiators to dump its waste heat into space so that's not that<@!163143541160148992>
plane-crazy 2020-03-17 18:06:34 Yeah it's interesting
plane-crazy 2020-03-17 18:06:26 <@!615356321340063784> Oh I see
plane-crazy 2020-03-17 17:57:00 <@!615356321340063784> I mean can you post the image you have so I can see?
plane-crazy 2020-03-17 17:55:58 Yeah just show me what you have
