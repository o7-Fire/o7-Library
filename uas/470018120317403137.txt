creations-chat 2020-09-03 22:36:12 If motor locking was something you're not allowed to do, devs would've removed it/patched it by now.

bot-central 2020-09-24 23:44:09 -mapsuggest A spase area located above 10k alt and can only be accessed when going at a certain speed. Obviously, there's no gravity, and also, control surfaces, propeller engines and jet engines don't work there, you don't die in the vacuum because that would probably be chaotic, and maybe, just maybe.. An EVA Pack that you place as a block and that you can wear, which only works in space for better movement. (Jetpack is hard to control in 0g.) Also add atmospheric re-entry that only slows down your fall and only adds burn marks or changes the colors of blocks but don't actually melt/destroy them.
bot-central 2020-09-24 23:44:52 They better
bot-central 2020-09-24 23:45:52 In my suggestion, I guess control surfaces should still work even though there's supposed to be no air in space
bot-central 2020-09-24 23:46:07 But props and jets shouldn't work there as props and jets need air to work
bot-central 2020-09-24 23:46:27 Oh shoot I forgot to add "RCS thusters" in my suggestion
bot-central 2020-09-24 23:46:44 RCS thrusters with automatic dampening
bot-central 2020-09-24 23:46:54 But this is map suggestion
bot-central 2020-09-25 00:18:39 -mapsuggest When the new map is added, make a server housing the old map for those who want to re-live the good old days of plane crazy.
