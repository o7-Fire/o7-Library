creations-chat 2021-11-28 02:33:03 Missile pods are a bit larger and " cartoon-ish" ingame, But to be honest they still look good. Also from what I remember from when I played  the nose of it seems sharp compared to the the real helicopter. Another thing I saw was your intakes, atleast from what I can see (the resolution is a bit low) seem angled up rather than the lax rounded intake from ingame. Also don't chu think it'd be cool to get that rare gold version? Overall its still pretty good.

help 2021-12-01 22:24:36 alright, I'm currently build the bow and first sections of my zoelguut class. I ran into an issue and improvised. Every time a section starts & end, they fold over each other and I couldn't replicate. Would it be better (in your guy's opinion) Have that fold be "indented" or just a black line separating the section. (As seen in images)
