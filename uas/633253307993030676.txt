bug-reports 2022-05-18 16:24:47 the 'projectile' is supposed to  fly away but instead it just stays in the air
bug-reports 2022-05-18 16:26:00 this occurs right after I disconnect it with disconnectors, the frame that aims the rocket is build with motor 2's
bug-reports 2022-05-18 16:26:15 anyone know why this occurs?
bug-reports 2022-05-20 14:52:30 is there a reason this occurs? Or just a glitch I can't do anything about as a player...
bug-reports 2022-05-20 15:08:52 hm
bug-reports 2022-05-20 15:09:23 can it be fixed in pc2? Or do these things always occur with this kind of physics
