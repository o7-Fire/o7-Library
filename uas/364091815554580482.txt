bot-central 2022-03-21 20:45:42 &suggest [TITLE] - Timer on the blacklist zone after spawning
[CATEGORY] - PVP

[DESCRIPTION] - The blacklist zone should have a 5 second timer after you spawn your craft before it goes away in PVP because people will blacklist the entire server then use a turret to screw with people and not be able to be killed.
