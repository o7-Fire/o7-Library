bug-reports 2022-09-10 12:15:31 No i was just talking about autosave like ppl did when you scroll up a little
bug-reports 2022-09-10 12:16:51 Okay ig
creations-chat 2022-09-12 07:32:13 late reply but yeah
make it a little longer or something idk i only build fighter planes
creations-chat 2022-09-13 13:58:56 At least its effective in pvp lmao
creations-chat 2022-09-13 14:00:57 In ground vehicles only i forgot

I don't really care abt looks as long as its effective
creations-chat 2022-09-13 14:02:58 Ah okay then, my mistake to post my pvp car there
creations-chat 2022-09-13 14:11:06 Thanks lol, it's only effective against land vehicles though. But if a shredder comes near it i can just self destruct and destroy a good chunk of it <:trollface:775024642104229898>
