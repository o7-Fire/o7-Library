creations-chat 2023-04-16 16:37:02 if you rely on fps for stabilization too much then a rando with a giant build will just pop up in your server and ruin it all
help 2023-04-16 16:38:56 depends on whether its a violent shake or a sort of hard wobble
help 2023-04-16 16:39:36 as in it wobbles instead of shivering sorta
help 2023-04-16 16:40:38 if it wobbles instead of shivering put wing panels in the nose corresponding to whatever axis youre shaking in
help 2023-04-16 16:41:31 otherwise put the panels in the back in the same way if its shivering

creations-chat 2023-04-16 16:49:11 guys its easy to fix wobble you just gotta buy the new intel 5.9millionth gen processor with the NVIDIA RTX 10080 gpu

creations-chat 2023-04-16 17:25:00 idk why but so many people i see overmotorlock their builds to look cool, even if it could be perfectly replicated without
creations-chat 2023-04-16 17:27:23 it probably looks pretty decent and then you put it in creations and theres a 100 downvotes cause you missed an angle by 1Â°ðŸ’€
creations-chat 2023-04-16 17:31:04 according to downvoters if your build doesnt look like something in hall of fame youre trash

creations-chat 2023-04-16 18:26:00 why are people talking about the biologically incorrect fact that there are more than 2 genders? look man ive been in med school for the last six yrs and i think i can say there are only supposed to be 2(in humans)
creations-chat 2023-04-16 18:35:25 you cannot change gender without becoming infertile through HRT, so since youre infertile i would consider you intersex and therefore whatever gender you were before HRT (although this is strange to describe because infertility is not exactly intersex and things get very complex during hrt)
creations-chat 2023-04-16 18:39:56 intersex is not xxy like a calico cat, it is either xy or xx like normal but the dna was either damaged or malfunctioned during its combination with the egg or sperms dna (very oversimplified)
creations-chat 2023-04-16 18:50:28 not all traits are genetic mutations, most come from the combining chromosomes during fertilization
creations-chat 2023-04-16 18:55:17 i said most arent not all, and blue eyes are a recessive trait.
creations-chat 2023-04-16 19:00:07 i personally have no clue about why this argument is about a flag i just cant let people be educated about biology incorrectly lol
