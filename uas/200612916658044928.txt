bug-reports 2022-11-01 00:29:06 the game didn't update roblox mest up
bug-reports 2023-03-16 16:39:41 you know roblox might revert those changes they made
bug-reports 2023-03-16 16:39:56 they do sometimes
bug-reports 2023-03-16 16:40:13 you think it's not effecting other games ?
bug-reports 2023-03-16 16:41:11 many games use the core engine of roblox and their last update weakend connection parts and that can probablly allow for new exploit glitch in bunch of games
bug-reports 2023-03-16 16:43:35 when physics get fixed things will go back to normal
bug-reports 2023-03-16 16:45:53 yet it survives cause it's one of the only game where your creations comes alive with out any limits
bug-reports 2023-03-16 16:47:19 oh how ?
bug-reports 2023-03-16 16:48:19 the only thing that effects me is the motor 2 bug thing where planes can'T fly
bug-reports 2023-03-16 16:48:35 but appart from that all the other bugs you mentioned i got things to fix em
bug-reports 2023-03-16 16:48:52 and they are simple and don't effect build looks or build time
bug-reports 2023-03-16 16:49:49 you know there is 2 parts in the community right
bug-reports 2023-03-16 16:49:59 you got those who creat things using bugs
