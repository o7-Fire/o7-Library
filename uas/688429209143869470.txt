bug-reports 2022-03-16 22:09:06 my pvp rockets seem to fire about 8 seconds late after pressing the launch key
bug-reports 2022-03-16 22:09:39 I would press the designated key, the rockets would go invisible or something from the rocket holder part
bug-reports 2022-03-16 22:10:16 and then about 8 seconds later, they would appear at where I fired them,  follow their trajectory and then proceed to explode shortly after
bug-reports 2022-03-16 22:10:36 it does not matter whether I have low or high ping, this glitch will now happen every single time I fire my rockets
