creations-chat 2021-08-13 00:41:45 will slowmode in <#504436696021204992> ever get removed?

or will it keep getting longer?
creations-chat 2021-08-13 00:44:55 hof voting should be increased from 100 to 150 or something because 100 is kind of easy to obtain

 also the server is bigger

give me 30 sec or so to respond

creations-chat 2021-08-28 03:43:35 has <#504436696021204992> ever not had an argument everyday after the 2 min slowmode was implemented?

slowmode would probably increase to 3 mins after this

creations-chat 2021-08-28 03:46:58 has anyone ever herd of ‘suck it up and move on’?, we are in a Roblox discord server for fuck sake
creations-chat 2021-08-28 03:51:47 if someone is insulting/annoying you just ignore them instead of responding

they can’t respond back if you don’t respond first(mostly)

creations-chat 2021-09-09 03:07:57 very circular

it would probably move a bit to move the parts in place.

it will probably fall apart of it does fly

it might be able to do aerial reconnaissance if you stick a camera on the bottom

it might be-able to negate gravity idk

you can probably take bites out of it if you use cutters

creations-chat 2021-10-27 23:29:57 embed the motors into the chassis or into any place that has a 2x1x3 space

you can hide the side of the exposed motors with  disconnecter bases
creations-chat 2021-10-27 23:32:47 use half blocks instead of blocks and motorlock them inward

and save some space

or put the motorlock into the back below the spoiler

remember, motorlock dosn’t have to be vertical
creations-chat 2021-10-27 23:38:19 oh, I thought we where still talking about this creation

yeah it’s going to be hard but it’s doable if you only use small amounts of motorlock in different places

instead of one big tower in the middle
creations-chat 2021-10-27 23:41:13 I might try to build a car to get a feel on how hard/easy it is

build parts in modules and motorlock them together

**No Slowmode Pass**
[server]

can we make it so if you get an expert rank your slowmode <#504436696021204992> will get removed via a “no slowmode pass” but if you argue (or do something that’s worth loosing the pass), you loose the “no slowmode pass” and you have to get another expert rank to regain the ”no slowmode pass”.

**Things to note:**

- you will not be able to continue arguing more than 7 to 8 by getting another expert rank because we only have 7 or so expert ranks.

- why only experts?, it’s because expert ranks are somewhat hard to obtain and experts are also experienced players.

- if you see #deleted-channel, replace it with creations feedback

creations-chat 2021-11-14 09:00:16 the more detail you can fit into a space the better, BUT this can also mean the opposite. Too much detail can lead to a creation looking messy or “ugly”

yeah, somewhere in the middle
creations-chat 2021-11-14 09:02:45 hyperbot should get a “Tips” command

good try though
creations-chat 2021-11-26 07:36:09 ok, different people have different standards.
this also applies to people with different skill levels

also people tend to be more rude on the internet
creations-chat 2021-11-26 07:39:41 alr if you want tips then 
- if you use motor lock it doesn’t always have to be vertical
- make sure all parts of a build are detailed (different colour codes for example)
- too much detail can make a build look worse (messy)
creations-chat 2021-11-26 07:42:18 a bot should auto respond with shit tons of tips when someone says “can I have some tips” or something
creations-chat 2021-11-26 07:44:23 also if you want feedback that isn’t too harsh then move to <#384021699466756107> or <#478584971670454284>

creations-chat 2021-12-05 01:32:31 I havn’t really had the energy to build post/build anything so I’m just getting feedback to improve old creations before I start a new project. 

I have done some small changes like adding landing gear, and some small changes but yes most of the helicopter is the exact same, I’m go to rebuild it in PC2 so I can include cargo space and make it fly with other small details because of the resize tool.

thanks for the feedback
creations-chat 2021-12-05 01:38:24 paint it, also use multiple shades of a chosen colour

creations-chat 2021-12-05 08:32:24 bro, if people call your build “bad/trash” then they have a reason to say that, all you had to fucking do is ask why it’s bad the take the feedback and improve ur creation.

FOR FUCK SAKE ITS CREATIONS FEEDBACK, YOU GET FEEDBACK ON CREATIONS HERE
creations-chat 2021-12-05 08:37:50 use multiple shades of the chosen colour 

example
100, 100, 100
105, 105, 105
110, 110, 110
^ this will represent weathering and dust, and small bits of damage and will add more detail to ur creation
creations-chat 2021-12-05 08:41:09 also include small details like the the radio antenna, door handles, an interior (include a mug/cup holder)
creations-chat 2021-12-05 08:47:08 that’s doable
creations-chat 2021-12-05 08:49:36 use motorlock

creations-chat 2021-12-05 08:52:55 motor lock everything, but motorlock strategy, don’t spam it

like the hood, ect also you can hide the motorlock for the interior inside the hood
creations-chat 2021-12-05 08:55:22 if you need to yeah, motor lock strategy
creations-chat 2021-12-05 08:59:22 remember, motorlock doesn’t have to be vertical.
motor lock horizontally

oh yeah I forgot that, toggled motorlock
creations-chat 2021-12-05 09:01:50 didn’t people say your truck was “bad/trash” that’s why you are improving it

creations-chat 2021-12-11 03:53:24 does it have cup holders?, if not then include cup holders
creations-chat 2021-12-11 23:41:36 wth is happening?
creations-chat 2021-12-11 23:45:06 idk, it looked like someone started an argument ngl

creations-chat 2021-12-12 00:05:25 I mean, if you don’t need a strong device for anything then it should be fine

just don’t click on any links in ur DMs, ez

also don’t click on spoilers and videos unless you 100% trust them
creations-chat 2021-12-12 00:10:49 “rearrange your blocks better”
fuck I forgot the ping. Eh, your already here so you will have seen it
creations-chat 2021-12-12 00:14:24 you don’t have to “grind” plane crazy, you can just sit and build in plane crazy for 30 mins a day, once a week and you will still get good it also depends on how you like to learn
creations-chat 2021-12-12 00:21:31 can I have some more feedback on this creation?

I should probably send more updated pics
creations-chat 2021-12-12 00:24:27 since the tail has the tail on one side. if I attempted to make it fly it would roll uncontrollably

thanks for the feedback

give me 2 mins to respond again
creations-chat 2021-12-12 00:28:14 I’m considering adding a back door but there won’t be a point if it has no cargo space (I will remake it a lot larger in PC2 and I will probably make it fly)
creations-chat 2021-12-12 00:33:38 will do (probably gonna take the pics in VIP1)

creations-chat 2021-12-12 01:12:18 good idea
creations-chat 2021-12-12 03:32:02 shredders have ass range even if they spam weapons, 99% of them can’t aim

I legit went into a public server and a shredder just nose drived next to my non-pvp car ( I wasn’t even moving)

it kept on on missing 3 times in a row until it left
creations-chat 2021-12-12 03:37:01 I legit just stood motionless on a non-pvp car and a shredder missed me by 10 to 15 blocks (weapon spam +cutter nose drive)
creations-chat 2021-12-12 03:39:16 send me a pic of a “pro shredder” I genuinely want to see one
creations-chat 2021-12-12 03:41:19 it just looks like a gyroscope with weapon spam, nothing special
creations-chat 2021-12-12 03:43:48 but I don’t think it takes much skill to use, it’s just click and spam “F”

nothing special, it’s just click and spam weapons
creations-chat 2021-12-12 03:46:23 I’m gonna be real with you, when I pvp I like a challenge. I don’t want kills to be force fed into my mouth. Maybe you like that idk, it’s ur opinion and I can)t change that

and shredders feel like they just feed you kills
I want to use my knowledge beat my opponent not obliterate them
creations-chat 2021-12-12 03:49:39 shredders kill too fast imo, it’s just a “drone” that can be duplicated and spammed over and over I would rather spend 5 mins trying to gun down a hyper sonic duck then one shoting a plane
creations-chat 2021-12-12 03:52:20 I get more enjoyment out of long PVP battles not short and cheesy kills

cool

I might just end it now, different people have different options.

creations-chat 2021-12-12 03:58:46 yeah, it’s probably the big vertical stab, gonna fix that

and I might try add some details to the landing gear
creations-chat 2021-12-12 04:03:30 I will probably make it bigger so it can actually fly (the tail horizontal stab is a pain in the ass to balance)
creations-chat 2021-12-12 04:12:49 ngl, I was intending to make it look like it had a cargo bay door (and cargo space) but since it’s so small it just looks like a light passenger helicopter
creations-chat 2021-12-12 04:19:27 ngl, the side looks flat, maybe add a logo on the side or something
creations-chat 2021-12-12 04:41:41 plane crazy weapons can look odd on a small scale build

creations-chat 2021-12-23 04:28:36 it just depends on ur art/build style

if ur going for a “low poly/smooth” look the don’t put add details

if ur going for a detailed (hyper realistic) creation, go ahead spam as many details as you can find
creations-chat 2021-12-23 04:31:24 I’m gonna be real with you guys, plane crazy tanks are easier to detail then plane crazy aircraft

creations-chat 2021-12-23 04:39:16 if you recreated every grain of sand on the tracks then MAYBE it’s too much detail, probably not actually go ahead, recreate every grain of sand on some tank tracks

if you ever build a creation, make sure you use multiple shades of the chosen colour.

example:

105 105 105
110 110 110

this can give the effect of weathering and light damage and possibly scars idk

creations-chat 2022-07-21 13:55:39 if you ever build a creation, make sure you use multiple shades of the chosen colour.

example:
100 100 100 
105 105 105
110 110 110

this can give the effect of weathering and light damage and possibly scars idk

help 2023-07-07 23:56:46 If you’re going for a more realistic paint job, use 100 100 100 and some other variations like 105 105 105 but honestly, just have fun with the colours a solid grey paint job is fairly ugly compared to a multi-tone paint job with different colours and textures
help 2023-07-07 23:58:26 Also, if you’re going for a complex paint job, use wing panels motorlocked into the side of the surface although it may affect flight performance as it offsets the centre of lift so keep that in mind
help 2023-07-08 00:03:22 for what it improve, try using disconnector bases or trap doors to slightly widen the side of the fuselage in the centre of aircraft between the landing gear, I can understand if it’s not too accurate but it can be done to reduce the sides of the fuselage feeling boring or bland
bug-reports 2023-07-08 00:25:03 that’s likely caused by lag, save whatever you have on your plot to prevent accidental data loss and rejoin the server
creations-chat 2023-07-08 01:19:08 <@635268221489905666> looks good, but I would replace the solid white with multiple tones as the solid white just blends everything together into a solid block which can hide details

creations-chat 2023-07-08 01:33:29 go ahead, just make sure you use multiple tones, textures, ect as solid colours tend to drown out details

help 2023-07-13 08:06:12 try experimenting with the values, as the engine is larger, the value might need to get scaled up by a certain amount
creations-chat 2023-07-13 08:10:04 cool sky, I like the colour deviations
creations-chat 2023-07-13 08:14:52 conflict
creations-chat 2023-07-13 08:20:04 You know this channel is for giving feedback right?

<#384021699466756107> is for place crazy  convos and progress pics (not wanting feedback)
creations-chat 2023-07-13 08:23:17 because it’s easier to just say “that’s ass, fix it” instead of actual feedback but generally you can just filter it out to find the actual message without the fluff e.g, “the body is disproportionate”
creations-chat 2023-07-13 08:25:23 I would build the sections individually then install the onto the aircraft as it’s easier to improve them if it’s all spaced apart, i.e the nose looks abit wonky, use a motor lock tower or something to separate it in build mode then use a different combination of blocks using motor lock and half blocks  as the curtain version looks very rushed.

here’s my old build as an example 

https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/384025409945337856/843274119247560733/image0.png
creations-chat 2023-07-13 08:30:07 maybe try motorlocking onto existing parts but keep in mind it does look extremely messy and upgrading it will be difficult, I suggest having another motorlock tower going into another direction to accommodate for the upgrades
creations-chat 2023-07-13 08:36:44 For painting it, you could use the default plastic material then paining it so the leading edge appears to have highlights like increasing the value by afew values and make sure to blend it into the rest of the wing so it feels natural and not artificially painted brighter using slight deviations in the paint job, remember less is more
creations-chat 2023-07-13 08:40:31 try experimenting with the nose in a different save or in the corner of the plot. I would try to motor lock different parts together such as half blocks, disconnector (heads and bases) and really anything else as the end result tends to be rather different to what you started with. see what happens and try to mix and match them to create a nose or any other component

also, being able to know what a motorlocked build will look like without having to load it is an incredible skill to have as it saves time but it’s not a mandatory requirement to have to be a “good builder” like any other skill
creations-chat 2023-07-13 08:47:33 It may have been caused by the cockpit glass shape as it warps everything around it but I wouldn’t worry too much, I would take note from this current project and use it to improve all the projects you’ll make in the future, I wish you all the best in your efforts and I hope you have a great day
creations-chat 2023-07-13 08:52:23 and I thank you for accepting my feedback, I’m glad you found it very useful
creations-chat 2023-07-13 08:55:43 also just a question, how much space in a combat aircraft should de dedicated to an internal weapons bay? 

(for reference, the appropriate size of the aircraft is the size of the grey triangle on the plot)
creations-chat 2023-07-13 08:59:53 alright cool, thank you so much, I hope you have a nice day
help 2023-07-13 09:25:19 may I ask, what’s the settings on the motor 2?
help 2023-07-13 09:26:59 is the instability caused when you use A and Q or E and D (or any other variation)?
help 2023-07-13 09:27:18 as they are both doing the same job, they may cancel the other motor out or cause excessive movement
help 2023-07-13 09:28:29 Can you see what happens if you replace the outside motor with a block and fly forward?
help 2023-07-13 09:29:19 ohh I see
help 2023-07-13 09:29:54 I’m pretty sure the control surface is motorlocked into the body or the vertical stabiliser
help 2023-07-13 09:31:00 could you extend out the control surface by a block to isolate it and test it?
help 2023-07-13 09:33:04 actually, I think I remember a fix
help 2023-07-13 09:33:38 increase the torque and decrease the speed of the motor to like 1 to 5
help 2023-07-13 09:34:05 Although it’s not optimal for air to air combat, it will reduce excessive movement
help 2023-07-13 09:35:55 1 to 5 was a rough estimate that worked for me, you can try making it like 25 but i’m not sure if it will work
help 2023-07-13 09:37:17 nono, make the speed any number from 1 to 5
help 2023-07-13 09:37:30 and max out the torque
help 2023-07-13 09:40:41 I would install the motors used for roll into the ends of the primary wings and only use the horizontal stabiliser for pitch control
help 2023-07-13 09:43:09 but if you intend to use the aircraft for acrobatics or combat, you could design an aircraft with hidden thrust vectoring or a set of default control surfaces to improve the performance of the aircraft
help 2023-07-13 09:44:03 Alright cool
help 2023-07-13 09:45:40 Remember, the distance from the surface to the centre of mass effects how much it preforms
help 2023-07-13 09:47:02 alright cool, I wish you all the best in your efforts and I hope you have a nice day
creations-chat 2023-07-13 11:27:25 another question, would weaponising a civilian aircraft be a war crime?
creations-chat 2023-07-13 11:31:50 very nice method for handling motorlock, I really like the shaping around the nose

creations-chat 2023-07-14 01:56:27 <@521504905693888521> just some feedback. I would decrease the hight and over all scale of the build as the US flag has 50 stars not 70 but other then that, the build is pretty good. I like the colour schemes used as they all complement each other.
creations-chat 2023-07-14 02:20:00 honestly, I would go for the Oil Spill Recovery Ship then handle the tennis stadium or airforce base after

help 2023-07-15 12:26:00 I would go with multi-tonal grey with a splash of red highlights on the wing tips and points of interest
help 2023-07-15 12:27:25 I would darken the red on the nose cone slightly so it doesn’t look like a toy
help 2023-07-15 12:27:56 And for the metal camo, mixed greys with a slight hint of blue or red for personality
help 2023-07-15 12:28:11 so like 103 100 100 as an example
help 2023-07-15 12:28:41 yeah so it’s slightly blue for the metal
help 2023-07-15 12:28:51 the metal on the jet isn’t solid grey
help 2023-07-15 12:29:03 it’s got a blue hue to it
help 2023-07-15 12:30:11 also, I don’t think “camo” is the right term, I would go with paint job unless that jet is trying to blend into a cloudy sky
help 2023-07-15 12:31:22 that was supposed to be an example for a splash of red, try 175 175 179

help 2023-07-15 12:35:13 it looks although try, Increasing it by 4 values on each RGB as it looks like the nose was in the shade when the picture was taken compared to the rest of the aircraft

help 2023-07-16 10:57:59 Yeah definitely
help 2023-07-16 10:59:52 I’m not too sure but I would motorlock in the railing made out of ladders
help 2023-07-16 11:00:32 yeah
help 2023-07-16 11:00:46 Motorlocked inward from the sides of the hull
help 2023-07-16 11:01:01 Or vertically, it depends on where everything else is

help 2023-07-16 11:06:29 oh, maybe try to split the hull in half then motorlock it upward and sandwich it all together
help 2023-07-16 11:06:54 I’m not too sure as I don’t really build ships, I tend to specialise in smaller builds
