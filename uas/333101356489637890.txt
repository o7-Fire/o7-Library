creations-chat 2018-11-22 22:36:14 <@!253999566444167171> I'm just giving a suggestion (although it does look really good) but my opinion in might look better if it was just a tad wider. Other than that bravo ðŸ‘Œ
creations-chat 2018-11-23 17:10:10 Built something custom, and I call it the Darkheart. Two things it does really well is flip people and drag race.
creations-chat 2018-11-23 17:10:19 Nothing special but I'm working on something else.
creations-chat 2018-11-23 17:15:46 Thanks Fun and Supreme :D

creations-chat 2018-11-27 15:50:17 My imagination built War Roadster. Made with agility and stealth in mind. The Roadster has a ring mounted axel that allows the vehicles wheels to be concealed very well, and adds more protection to them. It has all 12 rockets, and all 10 guns. 1 on the front and back, 4 on each side. There is landing gear on the far sides of the vehicle to act not only as a safeguard when moving, but also as a anti-flip system. The vehicle has a boost mode (6 super rocket engines) that allows it to quickly get away when in need of speed. There's a total of 3 layers between you (the driver) and the outside, but is weak to air attacks. But what it lacks in armor, it makes up for in defense, as 8 of 12 of said rockets are able to go fully straight up, allowing you to launch missles at passing by planes. It's color is a part of stealth, as it can be almost impossible to see at night, rather than the vehicle being all white or some other bright color.

creations-chat 2018-11-30 18:47:04 This is the USS Liopasent, a nuclear research vessel that has a working missle bay. This ship was built purely to research things it finds in the ocean, as well as test new types of missles.

creations-chat 2019-05-31 12:06:10 for being a RB studio modeler in which makes money of of roblox;
creations-chat 2019-05-31 12:06:15 that's really good.
creations-chat 2019-05-31 12:06:44 i couldnt make that even in studio if i wanted too, let alone PC
creations-chat 2019-05-31 12:09:08 do you think you can make one better lol
creations-chat 2019-05-31 12:09:24 then why dont you?
creations-chat 2019-05-31 12:09:57 you can take time out to needlessly scold his build instead of trying it yourself
creations-chat 2019-05-31 12:09:58 k
creations-chat 2019-05-31 12:11:27 you said the cockpit isn't needed, although if he didnt have it the entire build would look bad
creations-chat 2019-05-31 12:11:28 therefore
creations-chat 2019-05-31 12:11:34 your statement is invalid
creations-chat 2019-05-31 12:11:37 have a nice day
creations-chat 2019-05-31 12:12:32 but you're worried about looks? if was to remove it, it would prob look bad, so might as well keep it for extra weight to counter the helium.
creations-chat 2019-05-31 12:13:05 sorry, ive got better things to do then try and ruin your day
creations-chat 2019-05-31 12:13:13 not worth my time
