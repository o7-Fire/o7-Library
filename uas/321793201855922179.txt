plane-crazy 2019-06-05 06:44:53 I was gonna watch a movie I've already seen before or at least something really popular and similar to what I usually watch as long as it seems interesting, but I decided to watch a movie that does not meet any of that criteria except for the fact that it seems interesting. I was not disappointed and nobody cares but I got that great feeling you get from good movies and I wanted to share this useless information.
