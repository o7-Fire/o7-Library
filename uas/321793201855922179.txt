The Tale of azythusalt (321793201855922179)
creations-chat 2018-12-03 01:49:42 I made a huge and amazing boat/land vehicle with a hotel kinda thing on top that looked absolutely amazing on the inside
creations-chat 2018-12-03 01:49:55 too bad I accidentally saved another creation to it instead of loading it
help 2018-12-03 16:22:41 Is there a place to submit your own contest along with a vip server link of there are vip servers?
creations-chat 2018-12-03 22:31:31 I created a vehicle that spins and not too fast but it will fling anything that hits it and it is almost immovable aside from it moving itself
help 2018-12-08 17:24:14 So I am making a toothless and the design is okay but it doesn't fly very well. the maneuverability is absolutely trash but I don't wanna shrink the wings and add too many control surfaces bc I don't want it to look even worse. Any ideas?
help 2018-12-08 17:27:03 Also whenever I rotate to the left my creation does it but turns right and when I try to lean right it leans but the creation turns left. Any ideas?
help 2018-12-08 17:35:08 I already kinda messed up the look with the rockets
help 2018-12-08 17:35:14 But the turning is also a huge issue
creations-chat 2018-12-21 22:24:24 So it's a cruise ship that can drive on land or in the water, and if you add more helium it can kinda fly. I love taking it over the jumps in the water.
creations-chat 2018-12-21 22:24:25 
creations-chat 2018-12-21 22:25:18 Idk if this is how you get ranks but I think so
creations-chat 2018-12-21 22:25:26 causes a great deal of lag to most
creations-chat 2018-12-21 22:45:23 So this is an entirely prop vehicle that can vtol to go up then reposition the props forwards or back to go forwards or back. It is not the best looking nor the best functioning but it works. No helium either.
creations-chat 2018-12-21 22:45:57 
creations-chat 2018-12-21 22:46:31 Is there anything else I need to do for ranks or do I just post and hope someone sees it?
creations-chat 2018-12-21 22:48:27 Oh. Would it be spam to repost so my username is present?
creations-chat 2018-12-21 22:48:47 Think I'd get away with deleting then reposting?
creations-chat 2018-12-21 22:50:07 Okay thanks.
creations-chat 2018-12-21 22:51:20 yeah
creations-chat 2018-12-22 00:15:09 So basically I improved upon my prop vehicle so now you lift up with props, go forwards or backwards with props, and rotate the vertical props where they face opposite directions to rotate the craft side to side.
creations-chat 2018-12-22 00:15:15 
creations-chat 2018-12-22 00:15:48 And idk if you saw the lag monster cruise ship I posted earlier that can drive on both land and in water and do the water jumps pretty well.
creations-chat 2018-12-22 00:17:01 yeah but I wanted to make it complicated
creations-chat 2018-12-22 00:17:10 More blocks is better I think
creations-chat 2018-12-22 00:18:17 Well it would just be more motors
creations-chat 2018-12-22 00:19:27 Plus this still qualifies for the prop master rank. Vtol with no engines or helium
creations-chat 2018-12-22 00:20:14 And I fixed the problem of it uncontrollably rotating that I had before lol
creations-chat 2018-12-22 00:23:38 Rlly hoping a mod comes on this time to check out my builds before they get pushed too far for them to see.
creations-chat 2018-12-22 00:30:20 So this is a two story cruise ship complete with a dining room/bar, a restroom, a top deck, and 8 bedrooms. It is able to drive on land and sail in the water so it is capable of performing the jumps in the water. This should qualify for the roles Sea Marshal and Lag Machine since it is over the 2000 blocks for Lag Machine and it is a ship that can sail and is over 2000 blocks for Sea Marshal.
creations-chat 2018-12-22 00:30:27 
creations-chat 2018-12-22 00:31:20 If you need proof of it being able to sail I can provide it.
creations-chat 2018-12-22 00:37:05 Gladiator, do you have hinges or something that bring those together? I saw the pic in general.
creations-chat 2018-12-22 00:37:28 Oh
creations-chat 2018-12-22 00:37:49 Are the motors all mirrored in everything?
creations-chat 2018-12-22 00:38:13 I see how one motor has a block in between it but I don't see the other one having it
creations-chat 2018-12-22 00:41:43 Idk
creations-chat 2018-12-22 00:42:20 Is it okay if I join your game?
help 2018-12-22 01:16:52 I'm not at the block height limit but it won't let me move my craft up?
creations-chat 2018-12-22 02:40:41 Made this trying to get the Dare Devil rank. It is over 500 blocks and it landed fully on the "aircraft carrier". It stopped and was landed. I do not know if this counts.
creations-chat 2018-12-22 02:40:44 
creations-chat 2018-12-22 03:46:00 Landed it. Over 500 blocks completely on an aircraft carrier. Sky Devil?
creations-chat 2018-12-22 03:46:10 Dare
creations-chat 2018-12-22 03:46:44 
creations-chat 2018-12-22 03:56:13 Cool
creations-chat 2018-12-22 03:57:20 turns out it is too wide
creations-chat 2018-12-22 04:21:34 So I did a barrel roll [not an aileron roll] at above 300 sps and then after I showed you an aileron roll to compare it.

creations-chat 2018-12-22 05:07:35 Well
creations-chat 2018-12-22 05:07:46 Nobody saw my other speed build
help 2018-12-22 06:21:29 yeah
creations-chat 2018-12-22 06:59:41 Well I made a creation capable of getting me to this speed
creations-chat 2018-12-22 06:59:42 
creations-chat 2018-12-22 06:59:55 I wasn't in the creation at the time of the pic but the speed was from the creation.
creations-chat 2018-12-22 07:00:04 Does that count for orbital?
creations-chat 2018-12-22 07:00:15 It is just above that speed
creations-chat 2018-12-22 07:00:28 Not sure either
creations-chat 2018-12-22 07:01:10 It does say using any means necessary
creations-chat 2018-12-22 07:02:10 wait
creations-chat 2018-12-22 07:02:11

creations-chat 2019-05-05 01:12:01 wrong chat whoops
help 2019-05-05 01:20:08 has anyone already suggested a way to transfer saves from one account to another so that if your main acc gets full but you wanna make your fav creation bigger you can do so?

Username-Sup3r_G8r [I made it on my alt so I could save it and I have a screenshot of myself in both accounts while on the build for proof that it's mine]
Requesting Modeler Rank
I don't think anyone has ever made a forest fly. It can turn right and left, pitch forward and backwards, move forward and backwards as well as side to side, and it can go up and down. I hope this qualifies.
creations-chat 2019-06-03 04:05:22 Btw I circled the creation in blue and it has 1049 blocks
creations-chat 2019-06-03 04:09:16 Well I've never seen a flying forest



It might not be creative but I think it's unique lmao
creations-chat 2019-06-03 04:09:45 It might not really be enough though but I hope it is
creations-chat 2019-06-03 04:11:42 lmao
creations-chat 2019-06-03 04:16:50 oh
creations-chat 2019-06-03 04:17:01 so it has to be creative too lmao
creations-chat 2019-06-03 04:18:10 Imma try and make an apple mouse aircraft hybrid thing just for the hell of it now
creations-chat 2019-06-03 04:18:29 damn
creations-chat 2019-06-03 04:18:39 well nvm then
creations-chat 2019-06-03 04:19:16 wait
creations-chat 2019-06-03 04:19:42 I thought you meant an apple and a mouse, not an apple mouse oof
creations-chat 2019-06-03 04:20:18 thought you forgot the comma in apple, mouse, and aircraft
creations-chat 2019-06-03 04:20:27 idek
creations-chat 2019-06-03 04:43:38 does this count as unique? it's wings are on those rotators and they constantly spin so they're kinda just weird wings which probably doesn't count but I thought that I'd test it out and see if it counts lmao
