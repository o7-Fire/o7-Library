The Tale of Sam le Canard Cool (521142746984087553)
bug-reports 2022-01-03 00:53:37 my saves arent saving, i saved a build, rejoined later and it was back to a previous save
help 2022-01-03 04:34:34 my save isnt working, i saved a build, then when i rejoined it went back to an old save
bug-reports 2022-01-03 04:59:54 does anyone know about saves not saving? when i go into a server the autosave for my build is 10942, the builds save is 9420, when i load the autosave and save onto the builds save it become 10942 but when i rejoin it goes back to 9420
bug-reports 2022-01-03 05:05:21 i can save on other accounts, it seems to be an issue with my main account
bug-reports 2022-01-03 05:05:39 ive tried on both the roblox app, roblox player and roblox mobile but i cant save on my main
bug-reports 2022-01-03 05:11:21 Ok so
bug-reports 2022-01-03 05:11:26 Build no save
bug-reports 2022-01-03 05:11:31 I save it to a file
bug-reports 2022-01-03 05:11:39 It say save successfully
bug-reports 2022-01-03 05:11:45 I leave and join again
bug-reports 2022-01-03 05:11:57 Save reverts to before i recently saved it
bug-reports 2022-01-03 05:12:36 And it for some reason is only happening on my main account
bug-reports 2022-01-03 05:14:24 Maybe just a roblox server failing to save the data or something
bug-reports 2022-01-03 05:14:30 Hopefully fixed by tomorrow
bug-reports 2022-01-03 05:23:35 Hope so
bug-reports 2022-01-03 07:20:45 Ok ill try that
bug-reports 2022-01-03 07:23:24 Do you mean wait a few minutes before saving pr save then wait a few minutes before leaving?
bug-reports 2022-01-03 07:23:46 K
bug-reports 2022-01-03 07:42:36 i waited 5 minutes after saving and the save still reverted
bug-reports 2022-01-03 07:43:34 Wdym
bug-reports 2022-01-03 07:43:58 Thats not the issue
bug-reports 2022-01-03 07:44:06 I mean the save file gets reverted
bug-reports 2022-01-03 07:44:24 Like in the save menu it reverts
bug-reports 2022-01-03 07:44:46 Actually my autosave doesnt spawn when I joins games either
bug-reports 2022-01-03 07:44:57 Ok let me paint you the picture
bug-reports 2022-01-03 07:45:09 I made a 10942 block build
bug-reports 2022-01-03 07:45:23 The last time i saved was at 9420 blocks
bug-reports 2022-01-03 07:45:26 What
bug-reports 2022-01-03 07:45:55 Bruhned
bug-reports 2022-01-03 07:46:15 I have several over 10k block builds with no issues in the past though
bug-reports 2022-01-03 07:46:44 ae
bug-reports 2022-01-03 07:46:54 Odd
bug-reports 2022-01-03 07:47:22 So now what should i do
bug-reports 2022-01-03 07:50:24 Is it 10k blocks and over have issues or just large builds in general?
bug-reports 2022-01-03 07:50:40 Damn
bug-reports 2022-01-03 07:51:16 I should just rebuild off of what i have so far
bug-reports 2022-01-03 07:51:45 I mean the only difference between the save and autosave was the autosave being painted and wedged
bug-reports 2022-01-03 07:51:53 Thank for trying to help tho
