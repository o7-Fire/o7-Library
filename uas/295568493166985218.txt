The Tale of Jameson (295568493166985218)
the-dump 2018-10-06 22:41:38 Oy, shut it about autism, I was diagnosed with that shit and I don't act like him now do I?
bug-reports 2018-10-07 17:56:55 Bug report: I saved this variant of my fighter at slot 7
bug-reports 2018-10-07 17:57:01 Yet this happened
bug-reports 2018-10-07 17:57:07 But I can still load it, and it comes out fine
bug-reports 2018-10-07 17:59:33 Question, are rocket engines SUPPOSED to be slower than the regular jet engines!?
bug-reports 2018-10-07 18:01:26 
bug-reports 2018-10-07 18:01:29 
bug-reports 2018-10-07 18:01:32 That, SPEED difference
bug-reports 2018-10-07 18:01:37 No I pushed them UNTIL they topped out
bug-reports 2018-10-07 18:03:30 It's happening on every craft I put them on .....
bug-reports 2018-10-07 18:03:51 What the, fffaaahhhhhhh, I wanted stronger engines so I could make something truly exceptional, without having to bolt on like 90 engines on
bug-reports 2018-10-07 18:08:56 Hey, 7 and 8 are fine, they just don't save the name and block count, your craft it's self is still there
bug-reports 2018-10-07 18:09:33 Like, as fast and easy as it is to swap those engines around, I was lazy and just decided to load the craft in
bug-reports 2018-10-07 18:10:48 I mean, the extra save slots are nice, but what I was REALLY looking forward to were stronger and faster engines
bug-reports 2018-10-07 18:11:56 Which, stronger, yes, these engines will really kick your craft along, faster? Look above
bug-reports 2018-10-07 18:27:08 Rick, no offense, but since when is 148 a larger number than 176? 148 was achieved by swapping some of the engines out with rocket engines, 176 was with the standard default design
bug-reports 2018-10-07 18:32:47 I actually double checked the controls and made sure all engines were set to the same as the jet engines originally, they were
bug-reports 2018-10-07 18:36:07 I was hoping to be able to use less engines, so that my craft wouldn't look like I just bolted as many of those things on as possible
bug-reports 2018-10-09 23:18:41 God dang it Xpert, why are you pushing the bar for designs higher?
help 2018-10-09 23:29:54 Honestly I'd be more concerned about the center of lift than anything else right now
help 2018-10-09 23:35:19 Like, to look the best or just to work? Because they'll work pretty much anywhere you place them
help 2018-10-10 03:07:33 Shouldn't "CG" and "CP" make it obvious?
help 2018-10-10 03:07:41 CG, Center of Gravity, CP, Center of Pressure
help 2018-10-11 01:25:25 Oh, yellow is center of mass, blue is center of lift
help 2018-10-11 03:48:49 Your center of lift is so far back that it'll probably just drop like a rock no matter what
help 2018-10-11 03:49:12 That'll drive the center of mass even farther forwards
help 2018-10-11 03:49:17 You want the center of mass to be close to the center of lift
help 2018-10-11 03:56:00 It might
the-dump 2018-10-11 06:19:55 Materials are just aesthetics, you have to actually program in the actual effects
help 2018-10-11 23:37:49 I heard it's turned pay to win
bug-reports 2018-10-12 17:55:15 Camera gets stuck sometimes in one position, whether it's a huge gargantuan craft, or a tiny tinfoil glider
bug-reports 2018-10-14 19:31:39 Why are all my creations saving with one block extra? They're still using less data, so it's fine, but still
bug-reports 2018-10-14 19:32:02 I DEFINITELY remember my tank (Not the push tank) saving with 302 blocks, now it's got 303
bug-reports 2018-10-14 19:32:47 Also the fighter MK 1 and MK 2 swapped spots, they were save slots 8 and 7 respectively
bug-reports 2018-10-14 19:51:58 All my planes are as good as dead ...
bug-reports 2018-10-14 19:56:02 https://im5.ezgif.com/tmp/ezgif-5-fdcd7f6aa481.gif
bug-reports 2018-10-14 19:56:42 I can wait as long as I want and it won't load in
bug-reports 2018-10-14 19:57:09 I HOPPED LIKE 10 SERVERS!
bug-reports 2018-10-14 19:58:24 I was on public server to public server!
bug-reports 2018-10-14 19:58:41 https://im5.ezgif.com/tmp/ezgif-5-f24c2dd1554d.gif
bug-reports 2018-10-14 19:59:24 I am, GENUINELY FUCKING PISSED OFF TO HELL ABOUT THIS
bug-reports 2018-10-14 19:59:52 Okay, it loads in the private server, but not the public ones
bug-reports 2018-10-14 20:03:37 Rick, this isn't a case of not being able to load on older servers, this is a case if I CAN'T LOAD ON ANY SERVER, EVEN THE NEW ONE I REJOINED WITH THE SAME PEOPLE ON IT
bug-reports 2018-10-14 20:20:18 Honestly by this point I'd suggest just reverting back to the old system
bug-reports 2018-10-14 20:21:32 I'd suggest just not coloring it yet
bug-reports 2018-10-14 21:47:56 It pulls out sort of an error log
help 2018-10-17 17:43:57 Basically dampening's the deceleration (opposite of acceleration) of the springs
help 2018-10-17 17:44:25 So in theory, max stiffness and zero dampening means they'll pretty much spring around like insanity
help 2018-10-17 23:00:39 Pistons so the claw can shrink upon it's self?
help 2018-10-18 00:36:08 Want me to give you my push tank, or is that a bit too heavy?
help 2018-10-18 00:36:26 Alright, I'll try to find which server you're in, give me a moment
help 2018-10-19 22:20:22 I'd say stick with keyboard controls, mostly because mouse controls always seemed a bit, iffy to me
help 2018-10-19 23:52:07 Nowhere near there, jesus, keep it close to the center of mass
help 2018-10-19 23:53:41 It matters where your engines are located, but otherwise not really
help 2018-10-19 23:53:52 If the engines are high above the center of mass, you'll pitch downwards still
help 2018-10-19 23:59:00 Yeup
help 2018-10-20 03:36:11 I listed out a set of parts already ...
help 2018-10-20 03:36:22 Jet engines, regular blocks (including wedges, 1X2 wedges and corner wedges), regular beams, all the 1X2 wings (not propeller blades however), motors, propeller ENGINES (not blades, there's a difference), landing gear, wheels and suspension are what I can remember off the top of my head
help 2018-10-20 03:36:34 Unpainted, that's how Arena works for now
help 2018-10-20 03:43:34 Arena's gonna be updated soon, so hold your horses until then, got it?
help 2018-10-20 03:45:04 Because it's more professional and generally better received, also less proof-reading later
help 2018-10-20 03:55:30 Hey, no need to be a jerk about it
help 2018-10-20 03:55:47 And believe me, I could swear you the hell out, I just choose not to honestly
help 2018-10-20 04:19:17 ...... <@!304977711988867072> , can you please deal with this before I decide to deal with it myself?
help 2018-10-20 04:24:32 You do realize that they don't HAVE to list "don't be a little shit", because that's just common sense and basic human decency, right? Or are you saying you're just an annoying troll that deserves to be stomped on until you're a forgettable pile of pulp?
help 2018-10-20 04:27:49 Do I need to say more?
help 2018-10-20 04:28:04 Do I honestly need to say more? You even openly admitted to being actively annoying
help 2018-10-20 04:29:42 So I'm the "agressor" for being called "nerd"? Quite frankly I think you need to crawl back to whatever delusional black hole you came out of and rot there with the rest of the trolling and annoying part of Roblox
help 2018-10-20 04:30:54 And you think that's not being annoying at all? Say that to yourself and tell me that's not annoying with a straight non-lying face
help 2018-10-20 04:32:21 This way, I try to be polite and you just throw shit in my face in return, and I will keep using this as evidence until you snap out of your delusion, wake up and actually realize what you've done, unless you'd like to specify
help 2018-10-20 04:33:16 Well what am I supposed to do? Just let him try to annoy me to high hell?
help 2018-10-20 04:34:35 And you think being called a "nerd" is a complement, or even remotely fine?
help 2018-10-20 04:34:49 If that's the case, specify it, because that's not a fucking complement in most people's dictionaries
help 2018-10-20 04:35:44 Let me guess, you just wanted to cause a fuss and get yourself banned, is that it?
help 2018-10-20 04:37:04 ..... I'm just gonna stop for now, obviously I'm talking to someone who's got something wrong in their damn head, some fucking neuron's been severed or knocked off course or something
help 2018-10-20 04:42:32 Meh, I usually ask people whether to do so or not, and I tend to flag alot, but not actually take action on it, because I'm aware of my admittedly short fuse, and I build around it
help 2018-10-20 04:45:13 Dragon, fucking back me up on this, is he, or is he not just being a jackass for no reason whatsoever other than to be one?
help 2018-10-20 04:47:27 And your "laughter" is quite frankly twisted, horrid, and generally only reserved for people we put in prisons or to death, now piss the actual fuck off before someone decides to act upon that
help 2018-10-20 21:07:28 Did you place control surfaces on?
help 2018-10-21 01:54:28 You can make a "plane" fly without wings ya know
help 2018-10-21 01:55:03 Hence the quotes

the-dump 2018-10-21 20:13:30 Which one? Stolen one or original one?
the-dump 2018-10-21 20:13:51 RIP Boopbot
help 2018-10-22 03:07:51 Answer: No, reason: Look at the criteria
help 2018-10-22 03:11:40 Do we really need to go over this again? Let me guess, I'm gonna be "aggressive", and you're gonna play the victim again, even after attempting to insult me?
help 2018-10-22 03:13:11 Just fuck off
help 2018-10-22 11:47:55 What type? Pitch? Yaw? Roll?
help 2018-10-22 11:48:43 Pitch is up and down, yaw is left and right, roll is, obviously roll, clockwise or counterclockwise
help 2018-10-22 11:50:01 If you want something to maneuver quickly, you want control surfaces, and/or thrust as far from the center of mass as possible in your direction
help 2018-10-22 11:50:19 Aka: A "brute force" strategy is more effective further from the center of mass (yellow orb)
help 2018-10-22 12:24:06 If you're struggling to take off, you need the center of lift (blue orb) closer to the center of mass (yellow orb)
help 2018-10-22 12:24:32 If it's too far forwards, you'll pitch upwards and only upwards, if it's too far back, your craft will want to smash into the floor
help 2018-10-22 12:24:40 Well this is Roblox, you don't need structural integrity for most things
help 2018-10-23 00:54:51 I know the mechanic he's using, it's a stabilization mechanic
help 2018-10-23 00:55:09 Real world physics uses it in alot of stuff, including bullets and rockets
help 2018-10-23 00:55:43 A spinning object doesn't like to stop spinning, and to turn it, you need to use ALOT of force, and I mean a FUCKTON
help 2018-10-23 00:56:01 So give it a spin and it'll fly in a straight line with a, not 100%, but a very sizable garuntee
creations-chat 2018-10-24 03:16:31 Capture and show proof?
creations-chat 2018-10-24 03:18:26 Just show it
creations-chat 2018-10-24 03:19:28 Just freaking show it chilly, we don't care if it's pink, purple or freaking rainbow barf
creations-chat 2018-10-24 03:19:38 What matters is the shape
creations-chat 2018-10-24 03:21:28 Ehhhh, it's a really tough call, because he did make some iterations upon it
creations-chat 2018-10-24 03:23:02 I'd say he iterated enough to call his a branch, but not enough that he can call the concept his
creations-chat 2018-10-24 03:23:31 So, in other words, he has every right to say "This current iteration is mine", but he can't say "This was entirely built by me"
creations-chat 2018-10-24 03:26:54 Yeup, he's copying
creations-chat 2018-10-24 03:27:23 
creations-chat 2018-10-24 03:28:19 If he tried to copy my fighter I would've kicked up a huge fuss, like I did earlier
creations-chat 2018-10-24 03:37:33 Shut it, just, shut it, I'm Chinese here, now shut it ya racist fuck
creations-chat 2018-10-24 03:37:47 That is way more offensive than you seem to give a fuck about
creations-chat 2018-10-24 03:40:11 ..... <@!163143541160148992> , can you please take care of this racist fuck for me?
creations-chat 2018-10-24 03:40:50 You don't get to be sorry, you get to be burnt by the very people you fucking insult
creations-chat 2018-10-24 04:09:27 Simply put AKaLi was pretending to be "Asian" and said random gibberish bullshit, entirely shamelessly, until I brought it up, and after that he still attempted it
creations-chat 2018-10-24 04:11:54 ...... Something tells me "ASIANS" are not welcome in this server <@!163143541160148992> , maybe they "ought to leave" before it gets out of hand (If you couldn't tell, the last part was with alot of sarcasm)
creations-chat 2018-10-24 04:12:50 And yes, I am pinging you Empire, because this is fucking racist beyond any reasonable response or amount
creations-chat 2018-10-24 04:13:17 ....
creations-chat 2018-10-24 04:15:08 What grade of humiliating do you want? Minor, major, or "Get the fuck out of this server" humiliating? Because I'd imagine I can find plenty of proof that'll blast you to hell and back
creations-chat 2018-10-24 04:15:42 Simply put, sneakers here decided to pick up the racism, whether intentional or not, of AKaLi
creations-chat 2018-10-24 04:17:23 Oh, so you mean only your fucking "English" is considered true english?
creations-chat 2018-10-24 04:17:31 Grizzly, shut it
creations-chat 2018-10-24 04:19:46 .... Are you serious?
creations-chat 2018-10-24 04:19:50 Also, nice craft mahina
creations-chat 2018-10-24 04:20:57 ... <@!163143541160148992> <@456226577798135808> <@!252094891448860673> , can one of you do something about this fuck before he harasses everyone out of the server?
creations-chat 2018-10-24 04:21:08 I am very much loosing my patience
creations-chat 2018-10-24 04:22:31 How about I grab the biggest loaded "'Murican" shotgun, shove it up your ass as far as it'll go and pull the trigger until the pellets fly out of your head?
creations-chat 2018-10-24 04:22:48 Just submit it nearist, it'll go in <#384025409945337856>
creations-chat 2018-10-24 04:24:12 Alright, I'll fight you with the fucking XM214 microgun
creations-chat 2018-10-24 04:25:58 Something tells me he's not offline ... just pretending

creations-chat 2018-10-24 04:32:25 And the dumbass returns, for fuck's sake
creations-chat 2018-10-24 04:33:11 You've mentioned it a bunch of time Future
creations-chat 2018-10-24 04:35:32 All the admins and mods are offline, unless Empire would like to CHANGE that
creations-chat 2018-10-24 04:36:32 Not really to be honest
creations-chat 2018-10-24 04:51:22 Eh, well I guess now you know, I'm not entirely sure who was 100% first, but after looking it up it does seem like you plagiarized his creation
creations-chat 2018-10-24 04:51:48 You can't just go "This was his" to the first person, then expect everyone to know that you got some reference from him
creations-chat 2018-10-24 04:53:15 Well chilly's offline for now, explain it to him when he's online
creations-chat 2018-10-24 05:05:05 I'd say a vehicle or mechanism nobody has made before, but it has to be unique en- EMPIRE WHERE THE HELL WERE YOU AT!?
creations-chat 2018-10-24 05:05:33 Where, the actual hell were you at? Seriously, scroll up, or if you want I'll just hork out the important chat at you
creations-chat 2018-10-24 05:06:02 I'd say both, but only if the vehicle's truly something someone hasn't made yet
creations-chat 2018-10-24 05:06:33 Ah, that's a bad habbit, I thought you were actually online the entire time, hence the pings, which were for a relatively important reason by the way ...
creations-chat 2018-10-24 05:07:48 Obscenely toxic
creations-chat 2018-10-24 05:08:00 Like, I genuinely wanted to do the shotgun thing to him, toxic
creations-chat 2018-10-24 05:08:52 ... Seriously Empire?
creations-chat 2018-10-24 05:08:57 Are y- are you actually serious?
creations-chat 2018-10-24 05:09:39 What do you mean "more" exactly? Did you see the fucking talk about communism and such?
creations-chat 2018-10-24 05:10:00 ....
creations-chat 2018-10-24 05:10:08 You have got, to be actually, shitting me

creations-chat 2018-10-24 05:12:26 My bad! Didn't realize it'd do that
creations-chat 2018-10-24 05:12:46 It'd still flood the chat, even in <#497142796961054721>
creations-chat 2018-10-24 05:13:01 It seems to post whatever image is posted, regardless of where it's from, because I see stuff from <#384021699466756107> being grabbed

creations-chat 2018-10-24 05:16:23 God, just fuck it, I'm not chatting anymore
creations-chat 2018-10-24 05:16:36 What got in my head is the "Moderator" not giving half a fuck about it
creations-chat 2018-10-24 05:18:42 And sometimes I think you don't deserve that mod role, but hey, we all have our opinions now don't we?
creations-chat 2018-10-24 05:20:25 I'm doing it mostly because someone tried to harass me, and Empire's trying to pass it off as if he was just joking, you think he would've snapped out of it and realized I was taking him seriously at a certain point throughout all of that
creations-chat 2018-10-24 05:22:58 Because we all want it consistent in one place I suppose?
bug-reports 2018-10-24 05:39:22 It saved many of my custom colors, only the engines got pasted into yellow again
bug-reports 2018-10-24 17:37:25 Any engines I painted blended into a sort of yellowish color, the same one you saw on the wing of my fighter
bug-reports 2018-10-24 17:37:42 So, the ones on the interior seemed fine, but the ones I had painted to blend into the hull turned yellow
help 2018-10-24 17:47:14 Center of lift's way too far back
help 2018-10-24 17:47:37 Add more wings near the front, or add more weight in the back
help 2018-10-24 17:47:43 You want your center of lift to be near your center of mass
help 2018-10-24 17:48:02 Or some more wings in the front
bug-reports 2018-10-24 23:07:03 For some reason I'm able to save the blue on my fighter, a 10,45,110, and it saves fine (You can TELL it's not any of the pre-set colors) on the blocks, so I'm not sure
bug-reports 2018-10-24 23:15:13 How come my fighter's colors save then? I checked all the blues, they were so far off it's almost funny
bug-reports 2018-10-24 23:15:36 I'll actually show you what I mean
bug-reports 2018-10-24 23:17:27 
bug-reports 2018-10-24 23:17:29 Tada
bug-reports 2018-10-24 23:17:56 Why the heck does my fighter's colors save, yet everyone else gets some sort of error?
bug-reports 2018-10-24 23:18:23 I mean, I had to repaint some parts of it, so
bug-reports 2018-10-24 23:18:57 Meh, alright
bug-reports 2018-10-24 23:22:01 Ah, that's good to note
bug-reports 2018-10-25 01:26:12 I'm noticing it on my tank, if I rotate the turret to try to lock it between the front windshield, it gets stuck rotating downwards constantly until I move it to the side, or it glitches and flings it's self via physics instability
bug-reports 2018-10-25 01:26:53 And I mean my tank tank, not push tank, which is a shame, because shoving the turret in a 1 block wide gap was actually what kept the turret very stable while moving
bug-reports 2018-10-25 01:27:41 Yeup, glad I don't use motors to be honest
help 2018-10-25 04:21:17 Mega RIP, not even close
help 2018-10-25 04:21:20 They're sinking devices
help 2018-10-25 04:21:31 Ballasts are things you ditch or grab onto to weigh yourself down
help 2018-10-25 04:21:57 In theory in Plane Crazy, you can set their weight to the minimum, which would be a flotation device, but you can increase their weight to massive degrees
help 2018-10-25 04:22:16 Infact, from what I heard, original single ballast blocks weighed about as much as a jet engine, which is pretty heavy
bug-reports 2018-10-25 05:09:02 I mean, it's close enough for now until we get new parts, imagine flying around with tungsten armor
help 2018-10-25 22:36:43 For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction
help 2018-10-25 22:36:58 Take a guess why it spins with that knowledge
help 2018-10-25 22:38:45 Bingo
creations-chat 2018-10-25 23:05:13 Impressive
creations-chat 2018-10-26 00:35:52 <@!313403326081531914> , it looks like a Starcraft Phoenix
<@!423484500891140105> , just post it, nobody will judge
creations-chat 2018-10-26 01:22:23 If you want critique, missing a turret, engines weren't armored all along them, and the head's more of a shovel-like shape rather than a box-like shape
creations-chat 2018-10-26 01:22:29 It's overally pretty freaking nice though
creations-chat 2018-10-26 01:23:42 It seems like a republic-era Y-wing, so you want the turret to be a ball turret (Or as much of a ball turret as possible), but if you want to make it the same Y-wing that flew alongside X-wings, you want to remove the armoring on the rear half of the engine pods
creations-chat 2018-10-26 01:25:57 I'll get a pair of references for ya, both the republic era and X-wing era
creations-chat 2018-10-26 01:26:34 I could actually see myself making it
creations-chat 2018-10-26 01:44:30 Reactor?
creations-chat 2018-10-26 01:49:34 What do you mean by "reactor" exactly?
creations-chat 2018-10-26 01:50:40 There aren't even reactors of any sort in the game, so obviously he doesn't mean reactor as in actual reactors
bug-reports 2018-10-26 01:55:22 
creations-chat 2018-10-26 03:45:36 Holy freaking crap ._.
creations-chat 2018-10-26 03:46:19 I noticed based on the slight opening
creations-chat 2018-10-26 03:46:46 Welp, amazing one
creations-chat 2018-10-26 03:55:18 Oooohhhhh, now I wanna see you two fight
creations-chat 2018-10-26 03:55:35 Wait no we all know how that goes, TIEs are mass produced, X-wings are finely tuned
creations-chat 2018-10-26 03:56:21 Ah, welp
creations-chat 2018-10-26 03:56:34 Also holy freaking, quit pushing the bar of quality for the rest of us Sn00p! I've already topped off
the-dump 2018-10-26 17:56:15 I personally say keep it in because Empire has some seriously wonky definitions of what works and what doesn't (Another heli-style of craft entered)
the-dump 2018-10-26 17:57:31 I mean, sorry for calling Robo out, but anyone notice some similarities in design to these?
the-dump 2018-10-26 17:57:37 OH FOR, ffffffff
the-dump 2018-10-26 17:57:46 https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/504630451579781121/505407980016107531/RobloxScreenShot20181026_174102916.png
the-dump 2018-10-26 17:57:46 The Osprey heli and this
the-dump 2018-10-26 17:58:09 .... I swear to god Dyno I am going to punch you
the-dump 2018-10-26 17:58:53 But anyways, he counted this, it's similar to an Osprey, so if you can get an Osprey-like mechanism on your craft fonkl, he has to count it in
creations-chat 2018-10-26 19:15:46 I'm gonna just re-post my fighters, due to the new submission system and the fact that they might actually stay
Refitted combat fighter, built for performance above all else, with a shocking durability in Arena
creations-chat 2018-10-26 19:15:56 https://im.ezgif.com/tmp/ezgif-1-7625720bfeb5.gif
creations-chat 2018-10-26 19:16:18 Insanely maneuverable with full reverse thrust cappability
creations-chat 2018-10-26 19:18:40 Hey, it's for performance above all else
creations-chat 2018-10-26 19:19:49 My prized superfighter, built with aesthetics in mind rather than performance, although it's still not half bad when it comes to performance
creations-chat 2018-10-26 19:20:43 Glides better than most VTOLs to be honest
creations-chat 2018-10-26 19:21:56 When missiles roll out, I might use it as a missile platform or something
creations-chat 2018-10-26 19:22:25 Because currently it won't win in a gunfight, but it's got enough lift and such that it can probably lug around anything short of Fonkl's space station
creations-chat 2018-10-26 19:23:04 Fonkl, as much as I'd love to carry your station, it's too fat, even for this thing
creations-chat 2018-10-26 19:24:07 Also, if you remember the old design, you might notice a few tiny iterations to the nose
help 2018-10-26 21:23:25 Yeah, they've only ruined it for people that don't have literally hundreds of thousands of pocket cash
help 2018-10-26 21:29:15 I built a wall-riding turbo craft, but the issue was that blocks were one-shot at that time
creations-chat 2018-10-26 21:50:03 There are ALOT of VTOLs sadly, you came a bit too late for them
creations-chat 2018-10-26 21:50:19 Yes, even jet VTOLs
creations-chat 2018-10-26 21:58:55 Nope, already made one, sorry
creations-chat 2018-10-26 22:02:29 You know what? I'm throwing an idea down because I've not seen anyone do it, yet I'm too lazy to do it myself, rube goldberg device, go
creations-chat 2018-10-26 22:03:01 Do literally anything via the most complex and convoluted way you can think of, with a single push/hold of a button
creations-chat 2018-10-26 22:04:16 Hey, that freaking phone's amazing
creations-chat 2018-10-26 22:04:22 So no worries about reposts
creations-chat 2018-10-26 22:04:42 Actually, wait
creations-chat 2018-10-26 22:05:32 The boat's cute so you get a bonus point from me
creations-chat 2018-10-26 22:06:00 The save slot, post it here I suppose
help 2018-10-26 22:07:58 1 will fly better, 2 looks more interesting
help 2018-10-26 22:08:08 But I'd say 1, looks like it won't shake it's self appart
help 2018-10-26 22:09:05 Compare it with this
help 2018-10-26 22:09:08 FFFFFFFF
help 2018-10-26 22:09:12 God damn it, I'll just DM you it
help 2018-10-26 22:11:04 If you want realism, use 2, but fatten it up ever so slightly
help 2018-10-26 22:11:18 Because with 2, I feel like I could sneeze on it and it'd break
help 2018-10-26 22:14:26 Go with 2
creations-chat 2018-10-26 22:19:48 I'd love to see someone make a combat sub
creations-chat 2018-10-26 22:20:17 Well, I sorta mean like a fast, nippy little submarine designed for fighting stuff in the water, in the air if needed
help 2018-10-26 22:43:14 What's the main difference? The engine?
help 2018-10-26 22:43:57 Neo looks like it can cram more engines in, classic looks ever so slightly better though
help 2018-10-26 22:44:09 I'd say go classic for now, and expand to neo if you need to
creations-chat 2018-10-26 22:46:05 I'm pretty sure anyone can land on that, which is amazing
creations-chat 2018-10-27 04:56:42 Empire, for fuck's sake, give him it, we haven't defined what a bomb is, and if you want that logic, every single one of our fucking planes are plastic pieces of shit
creations-chat 2018-10-27 04:57:29 I did, "plastic crates being dropped from the air", either that's alot of sarcasm, or you're saying it doesn't count
creations-chat 2018-10-27 23:14:10 It's a pretty decent creation to be honest
creations-chat 2018-10-27 23:29:36 Here's a handful of suggestions I have to test it:
Start cutting off pieces of the wing on one side until it can no longer fly, that'll determine how durable it is (Be sure to disable autosave and to make sure you don't save the damaged craft)
See how little space it requires to turn around completely
How fast is it when going straight up, horizontal, and straight down
And finally see how little space it needs to stop/start
creations-chat 2018-10-27 23:30:01 That'll be durability, maneuverability, velocity, and acceleration
creations-chat 2018-10-28 00:33:19 How many blocks?
creations-chat 2018-10-28 00:33:24 Like, show the save slot if you would
help 2018-10-28 00:35:29 Erhm, when you're finished here Orange, roles in <#504436696021204992>
help 2018-10-28 00:37:18 Serious, no offense but you were overreacting to that, you could've just gone "Can you please let someone else try to help? Thanks", and that'd be it
help 2018-10-28 00:37:41 Sneaky would've gotten that he/she wasn't helping, left you alone, and you wouldn't have had to have said those things
help 2018-10-28 00:39:22 If I get a say, I'd say the general reaction's direction was fine, but the severity of the reaction was bloated to unnecessary levels
creations-chat 2018-10-28 00:42:46 I'd personally say it's bombardier-worthy to, considering it's able to carry a respectable payload
creations-chat 2018-10-28 02:19:40 I see it has folding wings to
creations-chat 2018-10-28 19:36:57 He rolls a nat-20 and pops your helium balloon
creations-chat 2018-10-28 19:37:32 But can you retaliate? Nope
creations-chat 2018-10-28 19:46:19 Center of Lift further to the front
creations-chat 2018-10-29 02:05:08 Function > Fashion, right?
help 2018-10-29 13:35:28 George, you've gotta make a very unique building
help 2018-10-29 14:02:23 It's gotta have a unique quirk to it
help 2018-10-29 14:02:31 And no, turreted doesn't count
help 2018-10-29 14:03:08 A turreted planetary base doesn't count towards inventor, it needs to have it's own unique thing to stand out
creations-chat 2018-10-29 19:30:18 Wheels occupy a 3 wide space, these "wheels" can occupy a 2 wide, or even 1 wide space if the user is clever
the-dump 2018-10-29 20:58:04 Whoever's copying whoever, it ain't gonna work
the-dump 2018-10-29 20:58:24 For every action there's an equal and opposite reaction, so for something of that size to move, well, good luck
the-dump 2018-10-29 21:00:19 ... Seriously? Do I need to bust out my superfighter to show how insignificant that comment was?
the-dump 2018-10-29 21:00:42 The pinnacle fighter so awesome that multiple people have tried copying it? Not just one little incident of copying?
the-dump 2018-10-29 21:04:10 <@!217336009455566848> , <@!252094891448860673> , <@158294656113836032> , I'd like one of you to please wait on standby and monitor this guy in the event that he copies
the-dump 2018-10-29 21:04:55 From what I know it's bannable if you're caught
the-dump 2018-10-29 21:05:06 Basically if you copy, they'll catch you and ban your ass to hell
the-dump 2018-10-29 21:08:01 Erhm, sorry, it's just that this guy might copy me, and I DO NOT want that happening, you've seen what lengths I will go to with the last time, right?
the-dump 2018-10-29 21:08:15 Anyways, now that you're here Super, you can watch over him, right?
the-dump 2018-10-29 21:08:33 
the-dump 2018-10-29 21:08:37 
the-dump 2018-10-29 21:09:06 Ehhhh, you're one of the only people with power though Super
the-dump 2018-10-29 21:09:15 So if anyone's able to do it, well, duh
the-dump 2018-10-29 21:10:18 Anyways, what do you think of my pinnacle creation?
the-dump 2018-10-29 21:10:30 (About the 5th time I posted it, sorry about that)
the-dump 2018-10-29 21:11:17 Extremely maneuverable, fully reverse-thrust capable, theoretically durable to no end, and able to clock at an incredible speed, all while having no assistance blocks such as ballasts or helium
the-dump 2018-10-29 21:11:59 Read it and weep ashp, checkmate
the-dump 2018-10-29 21:14:22 It copies the general wheel and frame design, but while it's not an original idea, you are very closely copying his design, too closely infact
the-dump 2018-10-29 21:17:24 You've just never claimed it as your own Super?
the-dump 2018-10-29 21:18:39 Oh cool, Brick Rigs
creations-chat 2018-10-30 12:59:43 So basically you have a forcefield Imperial?
creations-chat 2018-10-30 15:35:23 I was about to say, "Earthquake simulator"?, That's pretty cool, using Roblox's actual glitchiness to make something like that happen
creations-chat 2018-10-30 15:37:11 I was gonna say "I wonder what'd happen if X crashed into it", but let's not
creations-chat 2018-10-30 16:33:49 How fast?
creations-chat 2018-10-30 16:34:02 Nice, block count?
creations-chat 2018-10-30 16:35:16 Mmmm, post the save file?
creations-chat 2018-10-30 16:35:56 Alright, give me a moment to check the ranks over now
creations-chat 2018-10-30 16:36:42 I don't think it'll give you any more ranks, it's a nice build though
creations-chat 2018-10-30 16:37:54 You can save it in a save slot or the autosave to check the block count
creations-chat 2018-10-30 16:38:28 Ah
creations-chat 2018-10-30 16:39:08 Give me a moment to run down the list, do the rest of you think it's inventor-worthy or nah?
creations-chat 2018-10-30 16:39:23 Also you'd better be right with the ~750 part
creations-chat 2018-10-30 16:40:24 Unless it applies for inventor, due to the doubled land requirement you got advanced builder
creations-chat 2018-10-30 16:42:56 I'm posting this in general so it doesn't get sucked into creations
creations-chat 2018-10-30 16:43:22 Got it?
creations-chat 2018-10-30 16:43:33 So sadly you only get advanced, not expert
creations-chat 2018-10-30 16:43:45 Yeup
creations-chat 2018-10-30 16:44:13 Er, well, whatever, either way works, right?
creations-chat 2018-10-30 18:05:52 I think I'll let the others decide on this one, not feeling that well right now
help 2018-10-31 01:08:01 For replicator, find a real life object, and create an in-game representation of it
help 2018-10-31 01:08:33 Example: Create a Boeing 747, F-16, M1A1 Abrams, or something else that appears in real life
help 2018-10-31 01:09:02 Inventor: Create something entirely new, something that nobody's seen before, a pretty tricky one, considering like 99% of things have been built, you might find a niche though
help 2018-10-31 01:09:28 Builder: Just build larger creations that serve some purpose, landlocked creations require double the blocks though
help 2018-10-31 01:19:18 Eh, not quite
help 2018-10-31 01:19:34 ... What?
help 2018-10-31 01:20:01 Ah, I thought you meant for inventor, for builder, literally anything counts, but if it's primarily land based, which your tank does count for I think, double block count
help 2018-10-31 01:20:33 Ehhhhh, what's it's primary use, in the air? Sea? Land?
help 2018-10-31 01:21:10 Well, it's not really a tank then, so I suppose it'll count
help 2018-10-31 01:21:25 Hey, my turbo tank rarely if ever flips, and that's because I'm just bombing across the terrain at max speed
help 2018-10-31 01:22:31 Yeah, it's easy to make a creation not flip, just make it very bottom heavy, a pyramid essentially
creations-chat 2018-10-31 02:00:23 Try using streamable?
creations-chat 2018-10-31 02:04:57 Check the pins
creations-chat 2018-10-31 02:15:22 Oh, fine, hold on a bit, it's just infinitely easier for everyone else if you use streamable, or a video to gif converter
creations-chat 2018-10-31 02:17:34 I think straight vertically was meant Collin, although, mmmmm
creations-chat 2018-10-31 02:18:22 I'll count it, you were at about a 45 degree angle with velocity to spare, so you probably could've done that straight vertically, if not, empty out the hull a bit and there you go
creations-chat 2018-10-31 02:19:58 Done <@365636270040416257>
creations-chat 2018-10-31 02:21:09 Ehhhh, sorry Crash, all I can say is good luck
creations-chat 2018-10-31 02:21:19 It'd probably hit many problems similar to the resizing tool to be honest
help 2018-10-31 04:39:09 Which direction? Yaw? Roll? Pitch?
creations-chat 2018-10-31 19:45:28 You can't, Future, come on
creations-chat 2018-10-31 19:45:57 It's accurate enough from my perspective, although I'm gonna let the others decide since I'm still sorta new at this, and maybe a bit generous
help 2018-10-31 22:40:46 Mods can assign ranks to, let's see what you built?
help 2018-10-31 22:42:36 Chairception, uhhhhh, that one's difficult to decide honestly, it's unique, but, hmmm
help 2018-10-31 22:43:02 I mean, it's unique as well, hence why I'm stuck on deciding or not
help 2018-10-31 22:43:06 I'll let you decide Super
help 2018-10-31 22:45:05 I vote yes, it's a novel idea
help 2018-10-31 22:46:37 Seeya, we'll probably have decided by the time you're back
help 2018-10-31 22:47:39 So, that's a yes then?
help 2018-10-31 22:47:52 Got it
help 2018-10-31 22:48:13 If there was a third layer of chairception I'm sure it would've been a 100% yes to be honest
help 2018-10-31 22:49:32 I can see why he didn't, the top of the second layer must've been hitting the roof
creations-chat 2018-10-31 23:10:40 Looks nice though
creations-chat 2018-11-01 01:35:45 Looks vicious, I like it
creations-chat 2018-11-01 01:36:13 Not actually that effective, but it looks pretty vicious
creations-chat 2018-11-01 01:38:10 So essentially you've got modular armor, alright
creations-chat 2018-11-01 01:39:34 Sounds like my combat fighter, can survive about 80% damage, is stupidly maneuverable, and it's also capable of loosing balance on one side
creations-chat 2018-11-01 01:41:25 Turbo tank, never flips, even when I force it to flip with rockets, turret acts like a srimec
help 2018-11-01 01:43:28 Use engines to assist your turn
help 2018-11-01 01:43:52 Control surfaces, they're way stronger at higher speeds
help 2018-11-01 01:58:19 Stupidly fast?
help 2018-11-01 01:59:19 Ah
help 2018-11-01 02:32:22 Your speed
creations-chat 2018-11-01 02:45:01 Cleaned it up, you're welcome
creations-chat 2018-11-01 03:02:03 .____.
creations-chat 2018-11-01 03:02:13 Welp, I guess so?
creations-chat 2018-11-01 03:07:23 Impressive, show it being built
creations-chat 2018-11-01 03:07:44 Ehhhh, just record a video and use the converter in the pinned section
creations-chat 2018-11-01 03:07:58 Dude, it's easier for the rest of us
creations-chat 2018-11-01 03:08:02 F-12
creations-chat 2018-11-01 03:08:18 Not half bad Dave
creations-chat 2018-11-01 03:09:21 For Dave, oh yeah, definite improvement, even now
For ignac, I know that feeling
creations-chat 2018-11-01 03:09:47 Ehhhh, I'll check it out then, why not? I've got time
creations-chat 2018-11-01 03:14:26 Confirmed, it is a fully modular system that does properly equip
creations-chat 2018-11-01 03:22:32 Did you actually put engines on?
creations-chat 2018-11-01 03:24:43 You need to add the main pilot seat
creations-chat 2018-11-01 03:27:28 The heck? What do you mean?
creations-chat 2018-11-01 03:27:31 Like, flipping?
creations-chat 2018-11-01 03:28:16 Not enough lift? Too little control? I have no idea honestly
creations-chat 2018-11-01 03:28:43 Hmmmm, ask around, this one I'm unfamiliar with
creations-chat 2018-11-01 03:34:51 Wait, back or front flips?
creations-chat 2018-11-01 03:35:43 One side's imbalanced? I have no idea
creations-chat 2018-11-01 03:35:47 Auto controls are mouse controlled
creations-chat 2018-11-01 03:36:02 The fuck!? I have, SERIOUSLY no idea
creations-chat 2018-11-01 03:36:17 Nah
creations-chat 2018-11-01 03:54:40 I'll just give you a picture of what works
creations-chat 2018-11-01 03:54:49 
creations-chat 2018-11-01 03:55:22 This was made back in the day of jets, and has since been refitted, about 200 or so pre-refit
creations-chat 2018-11-01 03:55:27 ~450 post-refit
creations-chat 2018-11-01 03:56:27 The quirk about it was that it's stupidly maneuverable and durable, as it's a fighter, not an interceptor or strike craft
creations-chat 2018-11-01 03:57:02 ... No, I don't
creations-chat 2018-11-01 03:57:12 It's easy to make stupidly fast creations to be honest
creations-chat 2018-11-01 03:57:20 Stupidly fast and controllable however?
creations-chat 2018-11-01 03:57:26 That's a whole other ball league
creations-chat 2018-11-01 04:01:53 Okay, maybe enough with the hyperspeed pictures, we get it
creations-chat 2018-11-01 04:03:06 ... Ahem, do you not see my rank tag?
creations-chat 2018-11-01 04:04:48 Alright
creations-chat 2018-11-01 04:13:20 Well, nobody else built a modular car like yours
creations-chat 2018-11-01 04:21:00 Igna, try making a whole series of modular parts for that vehicle
creations-chat 2018-11-01 04:27:35 ?
creations-chat 2018-11-01 04:27:41 Alright
creations-chat 2018-11-01 04:28:39 Why not integrate the designs as the handles themselves?
creations-chat 2018-11-01 04:29:20 Actually, improvement you can make: Make the handles able to jettison
creations-chat 2018-11-01 04:29:48 Alright, good luck
bug-reports 2018-11-01 16:49:29 Updates come out when they're ready, rushed updates will always be bad, while ones given time may potentially be good
creations-chat 2018-11-01 18:14:25 So, do we count THIS as inventor <@!328598467972956160> ? Because I know inventor has to be the most unique rank of them all with some hugely practical application for making something fly
creations-chat 2018-11-01 18:14:59 I would've counted it because again, never saw a domino reaction before, 500+ parts, and it's a novel and, what seems to be 90% functional idea
creations-chat 2018-11-01 18:15:19 But I want your opinion on this, since you seem to be the main one that'll say no
creations-chat 2018-11-01 18:18:31 Don't quote me on this but if I had to hazard a guess, I'd say that's halfway what made him loose the mod rank, he just shot down everything that didn't agree with him, this is just a guess mind you, so it might not be true at all, either because that's not the reason or he didn't actually do that
creations-chat 2018-11-01 18:25:08 That I can agree with Super, but at the same time you did agree on that one guy's invention, didn't you?
creations-chat 2018-11-01 18:26:14 How about this, if we vote for uniqueness based on looks, it needs to fly with a ratio of 1:100 helium, that way it's very difficult to build weird and wonky things
creations-chat 2018-11-01 18:26:24 For every 1 helium there needs to be 100 blocks basically
creations-chat 2018-11-01 18:26:52 The way we'd be able to tell is via the build menu
creations-chat 2018-11-01 18:27:17 Example: 500 block creation, they should have 1495 helium blocks left to build with if they're playing by the rules
creations-chat 2018-11-01 18:27:50 Eh, I'm gonna go for classes, so bring it up with Super
help 2018-11-01 22:08:24 What do you mean exactly?
help 2018-11-01 22:11:12 A scissor type of gear?
help 2018-11-01 22:11:16 Like those scissor lifts
help 2018-11-01 22:14:17 Wait, why does the landing gear come out that way? Doesn't it come out the other way around?
help 2018-11-01 22:14:34 Like, so it doesn't just buckle like it seems to do with your craft, instead the drag causes it to pull out even more
help 2018-11-01 22:16:11 Not a problem
creations-chat 2018-11-01 22:56:29 Wait they don't?
creations-chat 2018-11-01 22:57:00 Ah, so someone can be master builder and lag machine?
creations-chat 2018-11-01 22:57:19 Er, wait, nevermind
creations-chat 2018-11-01 22:57:23 I don't know, I'm tired
creations-chat 2018-11-01 22:59:28 Future update, currently out in the test server
creations-chat 2018-11-01 22:59:43 And those things are nasty little suckers
creations-chat 2018-11-01 22:59:53 At least, if they had homing, thank crap they don't
creations-chat 2018-11-02 02:03:08 Can it rotate those engines to a more forward position? It'd count for prop master I think
creations-chat 2018-11-02 02:32:37 Well, ehhhh, not quite the VTOL purpose
creations-chat 2018-11-02 02:38:10 Bozo's creation
creations-chat 2018-11-02 02:40:58 Ehhhh, give me a quick moment, I'm really feeling sluggish today
creations-chat 2018-11-02 02:41:35 Done
creations-chat 2018-11-02 02:53:39 It's gotta be controllable, so sadly no
creations-chat 2018-11-02 02:53:56 Everyone seems to forget that part
creations-chat 2018-11-02 03:05:22 How many blocks?
creations-chat 2018-11-02 03:05:52 Also, another one of those wedge crafts in the background
creations-chat 2018-11-02 03:06:52 Crazy, how many blocks is it, and send it via picture of the save slot if you'd please
help 2018-11-02 03:34:08 Not creations, submissions, creations you just post pictures
help 2018-11-02 03:34:11 With the suggestions though
help 2018-11-02 03:34:19 Those you use !suggest (Insert suggestion here)
creations-chat 2018-11-02 03:35:05 Ranks given
creations-chat 2018-11-02 03:44:37 Can't even click on your thing, I think Discord's acting weird
creations-chat 2018-11-02 03:44:57 Yeah it's a Discord issue
creations-chat 2018-11-02 03:49:22 Is that actually controllable?
help 2018-11-02 21:42:03 What about make a pistol? Like one that actually works based on recoil
help 2018-11-02 21:42:18 Doesn't have to be based off of any real life ones
help 2018-11-02 21:49:31 DO IT! FREAKING DO IT! I can't WAIT to see that thing
creations-chat 2018-11-02 21:49:40 I'll come back when it's processed in a bit
creations-chat 2018-11-02 21:49:44 Nevermind
creations-chat 2018-11-02 21:49:57 Ehhhh, what do you want for it exactly?
creations-chat 2018-11-02 21:50:07 It's just a creation doing pushups
creations-chat 2018-11-02 21:50:14 Ah
creations-chat 2018-11-02 22:31:37 How many blocks epic?
help 2018-11-02 22:44:00 Wait, Xpert, I know what you can make
help 2018-11-02 22:44:07 Like, aside from the fighter
creations-chat 2018-11-03 19:27:24 Hey, you made little "lights" on the wingtips, nice
creations-chat 2018-11-03 19:27:33 Although the center of lift needs to be further forwards
creations-chat 2018-11-03 19:32:57 Simply put, put fewer wings on the tail and more wings up front
creations-chat 2018-11-03 19:33:05 Or you can try to shift the center of balance back instead
creations-chat 2018-11-03 19:33:23 Either use ballasts (These require guesswork since they don't affect the center of lift for some odd reason), or increase the back's weight
bug-reports 2018-11-03 19:36:13 We always had a test place brick
bug-reports 2018-11-03 19:36:29 Fair warning: Missiles have damage enabled
bug-reports 2018-11-03 19:36:34 So DO NOT abuse those, got it?
bug-reports 2018-11-03 19:37:14 If you want I can try dogfighting with you with the missiles
bug-reports 2018-11-03 19:37:21 I got a pretty vicious craft for that
bug-reports 2018-11-03 19:38:13 The saves will save, but they don't connect with the main game
creations-chat 2018-11-03 21:29:56 On it, just give me a moment
creations-chat 2018-11-03 21:30:11 GIVE ME AN EFFING MOMENT jesus christ today's not a good day for me
creations-chat 2018-11-03 21:30:34 How well does it fly Obs?
creations-chat 2018-11-03 21:33:04 Done, now excuse me while I throw up a bit (not really)
creations-chat 2018-11-03 21:33:32 Show it doing the various stunts in <#473249376223887371> and I'll rank you then
creations-chat 2018-11-03 21:34:46 Use something to make it easier to read please, I don't want to have to scan the video incase of a virus like I've had to do so often
creations-chat 2018-11-03 21:34:56 You could've used streamable, but that's fine
creations-chat 2018-11-03 21:36:44 Done
creations-chat 2018-11-03 22:32:27 Back, let's see?
creations-chat 2018-11-04 01:33:48 Already been done, so no, sorry
creations-chat 2018-11-04 02:45:09 Show me the helium block count?
creations-chat 2018-11-04 02:46:02 Use the hammer tool, place down a single helium block, and let me check the count
creations-chat 2018-11-04 02:46:11 The reason why I say place down a single one is because it updates after you place one down
creations-chat 2018-11-04 02:50:56 You can repaint helium blocks you know
creations-chat 2018-11-04 02:51:13 So show me the block count, use the hammer icon, and if it says anything other than 1500, I know you'll have placed a helium block down
creations-chat 2018-11-04 02:51:49 Well, 1499 if you place a single one down
creations-chat 2018-11-04 02:52:10 And the reason I ask to place one down is because again, that updates the value, which can glitch sometimes, so instead of showing how many you have, it'd show 1500
creations-chat 2018-11-04 02:53:10 Done
creations-chat 2018-11-04 03:13:41 What, the?
creations-chat 2018-11-04 03:13:57 How many blocks?
creations-chat 2018-11-04 03:14:48 Alright, how many blocks and are you applying for anything else?
creations-chat 2018-11-04 03:15:28 I can give you various ranks from the <#473249376223887371> category if you show the block count
creations-chat 2018-11-04 03:16:56 No new ranks, sorry Diamond
creations-chat 2018-11-04 03:17:01 Although it is pretty impressive
creations-chat 2018-11-04 03:27:52 Record it, used Streamable (check the pinned messages) or whatever program to turn it into a gif or something, and I'll rank you for it
help 2018-11-04 03:29:06 Put wings further forwards
help 2018-11-04 03:29:34 Then move the center of mass backwards
help 2018-11-04 03:30:22 Try fattening the back then somehow
help 2018-11-04 03:30:53 Alright then
help 2018-11-04 03:31:39 That one's tricky, make the back fatter, bump the wings forward slightly, knock off a few unnecessary blocks on the front, otherwise you're outa luck, sorry
creations-chat 2018-11-04 03:31:53 Submit a picture of the save slot if you would please
creations-chat 2018-11-04 03:35:08 Bit stubby for a type 7, but I'll count it considering this is Roblox

creations-chat 2018-11-04 05:24:53 Thank ye for that
creations-chat 2018-11-04 05:25:35 Honesty and honnor, that's how
creations-chat 2018-11-04 05:26:17 First, bombs, then you get bombardier for that

help 2018-11-04 05:27:26 Center of lift's too far back
help 2018-11-04 05:27:59 Forwards, yeah
creations-chat 2018-11-04 19:06:42 Land based creations are doubled Tim
creations-chat 2018-11-04 19:06:53 And you've already got expert
creations-chat 2018-11-04 19:07:31 Do we count warp drives as engines?
creations-chat 2018-11-04 19:09:06 The magnet drive that 126tank has is what we call a warp drive
creations-chat 2018-11-04 19:09:43 Ah, read over the <#473249376223887371> carefully
creations-chat 2018-11-04 19:10:00 Specifically in builder/lag specialist
creations-chat 2018-11-04 19:10:44 Yeup, also, well in that case, why not?
creations-chat 2018-11-04 19:10:51 Oh wait you already have it
creations-chat 2018-11-04 19:16:47 Simple, 100+ block creation that goes over 500 speed that's completely on the ground without anything from the engine tab (Apart from wheels of course)
creations-chat 2018-11-04 19:21:46 He uses magnets, which aren't an engine, to propel himself along the ground
creations-chat 2018-11-04 19:39:06 Dragon, can you not? Like, seriously, that causes alot of fights
creations-chat 2018-11-04 19:41:26 They repel and/or attract objects, how do you think a magnet works?
creations-chat 2018-11-04 19:42:23 Ask someone else that, I'm not familiar with them myself, specifically ask to build a warp drive, people that have built those magnet thrusters will understand what you mean
creations-chat 2018-11-04 20:00:38 Send a picture of the save slot if you would?
creations-chat 2018-11-04 20:01:54 Missing a tail fin and some vertical wing tips, so it actually looks more like a dual rotor huey
creations-chat 2018-11-04 20:02:26 Although, ehhhhhhh, hmmmm
creations-chat 2018-11-04 20:03:14 If enough people upvote you, you'll get replicator

creations-chat 2018-11-04 20:05:47 Check <#473249376223887371>
creations-chat 2018-11-04 20:06:18 I mean, aside from that
creations-chat 2018-11-04 20:08:51 It's, not really impressive to be honest Games
creations-chat 2018-11-04 20:09:12 Like, unimpressive for combat, for balance, for speed and, basically everything except firing angles
creations-chat 2018-11-04 20:09:25 Also cool oslo
creations-chat 2018-11-04 20:10:08 fonkl, I'm pretty sure everyone's seen that
creations-chat 2018-11-04 20:10:22 And let me just say that's a bit ambitious in terms of size, but still
creations-chat 2018-11-04 20:10:36 Well have a bucket of attention from me then
creations-chat 2018-11-04 20:12:07 Double requirement for land based vehicles
help 2018-11-04 20:21:55 From <#491710474786832394> about magnets, attract and repel pull and push respectively, when you hold down the key, they do what their name states
Toggle means that instead of holding down the key, you only need push it once and it'll turn on
Strength is how forcefully the magnets push or pull
Range means how far they affect blocks
Loose blocks means anything they're not attached to, when they're on, they only affect blocks they're not attached to, when they're off, they affect every block ON YOUR CREATION
creations-chat 2018-11-04 20:55:24 Tank, let me see how many helium blocks you have
creations-chat 2018-11-04 20:55:38 Place one down in a corner or something and let me check the count

creations-chat 2018-11-04 20:59:12 Er, I already gave you the rank tank
creations-chat 2018-11-04 20:59:16 Also that's fine
creations-chat 2018-11-04 20:59:22 I can see there's no engines already
creations-chat 2018-11-04 20:59:30 There's no place to hide them
creations-chat 2018-11-04 20:59:41 And since there's no place to hide them, they're all on the outer hull
creations-chat 2018-11-04 20:59:46 And since there's none on the outer hull, you don't have any
creations-chat 2018-11-04 21:07:24 Eh, still on me time, post it and I'll rank it later if someone else doesn't rank it

help 2018-11-04 23:36:15 The main pilot seat determines your spawn point, so you need it in order to spawn in your plane
help 2018-11-04 23:37:21 Yeup
help 2018-11-04 23:37:25 Happens alot
creations-chat 2018-11-05 03:26:47 Can you actually take half a second to read <#473249376223887371> instead of just shouting, unlike in <#491710474786832394> ?
creations-chat 2018-11-05 03:27:08 Then what does it say for engineer?
creations-chat 2018-11-05 03:27:39 Fucking hell, let me drag it over for you and highlight the important part
creations-chat 2018-11-05 03:28:14 
creations-chat 2018-11-05 03:29:06 .... I fucking regret this after what happened in <#491710474786832394> , but
creations-chat 2018-11-05 03:30:00 Just keep quiet before I change my mind and give you the muted role instead ya blockhead, I'm gonna remember that for a looong while
creations-chat 2018-11-05 03:30:28 Which one's propeller master exactly?
creations-chat 2018-11-05 03:31:41 How the hell does that thing fly?
creations-chat 2018-11-05 03:32:03 It shouldn't be able to fly, and yet here we are
creations-chat 2018-11-05 03:32:15 Also, if you want to get ranked on it Sam, send a picture of the save slot
creations-chat 2018-11-05 03:32:32 NOT YOU, LUCKYSAM
creations-chat 2018-11-05 03:32:51 For fuck's sake, READ FOR ONCE
creations-chat 2018-11-05 03:33:16 "Also if you want to get ranked on it __**SAM**__, send a picture of the save slot", you aren't Sam
creations-chat 2018-11-05 03:33:25 So I wasn't talking to you Dragon
creations-chat 2018-11-05 03:33:52 You're allowed propellers so long as they don't assist in flight, but I'll count downwards propellers as assisting flight, downwards rockets however, not so much
creations-chat 2018-11-05 03:34:01 Mostly because you can inverse jet engines and propellers, but not rockets
creations-chat 2018-11-05 03:34:57 What is it igna?
creations-chat 2018-11-05 03:35:55 Yeah, the steampunk rank
creations-chat 2018-11-05 03:36:44 Primary reason I'm imposing it on these two is because after the fucking fiasco nuke in <#491710474786832394> , I've entirely lost trust in them, namely because they didn't listen to THE ENTIRE SERVER TELLING THEM THAT THEY WERE WRONG ABOUT SOMETHING, even Superidra at one point
creations-chat 2018-11-05 03:37:38 It's safe igna, you make freaking creative things, so
creations-chat 2018-11-05 03:37:52 That someone was a fucking yesman that you probably paid for
creations-chat 2018-11-05 03:39:21 Are we seriously going to start another argument at this point?
creations-chat 2018-11-05 03:40:14 HAH! GOOD LUCK, but seriously, even if you were someone else I would say "Good luck"
creations-chat 2018-11-05 03:40:25 The last few inventors were seriously pushing it
creations-chat 2018-11-05 03:41:07 Folding, already done, hydrofoil, already done, not a new mechanic
creations-chat 2018-11-05 03:43:17 Missile truck done, and for Dragon annoyingly DMing me, spring launcher, done
creations-chat 2018-11-05 03:43:23 And don't worry igna, you did unique stuff
creations-chat 2018-11-05 03:45:30 See why I'm pissed off with these two igna?
creations-chat 2018-11-05 03:46:06 Yeup, all probably done already, so I'd suggest just giving up, you need someone with actual creativity and not a yesman to do it
creations-chat 2018-11-05 03:46:14 And if you think I'm being rude, just, ask Super what happened
creations-chat 2018-11-05 03:46:37 I don't want to go over it again, it just, it hurts mentally
creations-chat 2018-11-05 03:47:36 Don't worry igna
creations-chat 2018-11-05 03:52:26 Firearm's already been made, Empire made a rifle with a bipod that works
creations-chat 2018-11-05 03:52:45 Also, show a picture cake?
creations-chat 2018-11-05 03:56:59 For the heli, so that way we're able to see what's wrong with it
creations-chat 2018-11-05 03:59:38 OH! You're that one, huh
creations-chat 2018-11-05 04:00:10 Lack of stability at the base? I mean, those are some seriously large blades with alot of force
creations-chat 2018-11-05 04:03:15 Already done and already done, neither count
creations-chat 2018-11-05 04:05:50 Variable-incidence?
creations-chat 2018-11-05 04:07:21 Ah, already done, many of the VTOLs in Plane Crazy do so
creations-chat 2018-11-05 04:08:53 Did you dooo, what?
creations-chat 2018-11-05 04:09:36 Sorta
creations-chat 2018-11-05 04:10:57 Well, I think they're close enough honestly
creations-chat 2018-11-05 04:13:05 Done, not possible with the mechanics and done boymah
creations-chat 2018-11-05 04:13:59 Post the picture on what you have so far Dragon, I doubt it's original
creations-chat 2018-11-05 04:24:23 Let's see then
creations-chat 2018-11-05 04:25:30 Sorry to burst your bubble but nope, just not with landing wheels
creations-chat 2018-11-05 04:25:56 Someone did it with blocks and wedges instead over a larger interval
creations-chat 2018-11-05 04:26:39 But it's the same thing as the other guy's mechanism ...
creations-chat 2018-11-05 04:27:09 If you paint a horse black and white, it's not a zebra
creations-chat 2018-11-05 04:27:54 Dude, you're literally doing the thing I said and making a horse a zebra
creations-chat 2018-11-05 04:28:40 Fuuuckiiing HEEEELLLLLLL, DRAGON, IT'S ALREADY BEEN DONE
creations-chat 2018-11-05 04:28:53 .....
creations-chat 2018-11-05 04:29:16 Back when inventor and modeler were fused together, we gave someone the rank based on chairception, a chair on a chair on a chair, because it was very unique
creations-chat 2018-11-05 04:29:21 This is neither unique, nor is it the first
creations-chat 2018-11-05 04:29:56 Cake, make the body heavier, you've got alot of lift and not alot of weight
creations-chat 2018-11-05 04:30:24 Well, that's all I can see cake
creations-chat 2018-11-05 04:30:34 Expand the body outwards
creations-chat 2018-11-05 04:31:14 Also, Dragon, my analogy will still stand, a horse painted black and white is not a zebra
creations-chat 2018-11-05 04:32:17 ..... Dragon, you literally just typed out it's not unique right there
creations-chat 2018-11-05 04:32:29 "it does __**THE SAME FUNCTION**__ as other contraptions."
creations-chat 2018-11-05 04:33:30 Tank, I'm not giving him the most unique rank of them all, primarily since I saw someone do it before
creations-chat 2018-11-05 04:33:58 And he's claiming that just because he replaced wedges with blocks and blocks with wheels, it's suddenly a new creation
creations-chat 2018-11-05 04:34:11 Also, I was about to say someone else made a truck, but then I saw the patio
creations-chat 2018-11-05 04:34:17 Connected by a rope, niiiiiice
creations-chat 2018-11-05 04:34:51 I'm tempted to say inventor, but again, most unique rank of them all
creations-chat 2018-11-05 04:36:09 Something tells me Dragon's whining to the other mods that I'm not giving him inventor, even though AGAIN I HAVE SEEN A GEAR MECHANISM BEFORE
creations-chat 2018-11-05 04:37:44 It is fucking not Dragon, I have seen a gear mechanism before, and that is BY FAR a gear mechanism if I have ever seen one, JUST WITH WHEELS
creations-chat 2018-11-05 04:38:03 IGNORE THAT I AM TIRED AND ABOUT TO THROW UP WITH SICKNESS, so forgive typos
creations-chat 2018-11-05 04:38:30 Yeup, a Ferris wheel and everything
creations-chat 2018-11-05 04:38:43 Yeup
creations-chat 2018-11-05 04:39:49 I think that falls under rail based systems
creations-chat 2018-11-05 04:40:15 That was one of the first fucking things I saw ropes be used for ...
creations-chat 2018-11-05 04:40:49 Fucking hell Dragon, how ELSE would you make one!?
creations-chat 2018-11-05 04:41:08 A magnet slingshot? Nope
creations-chat 2018-11-05 04:41:24 People already made slingshots of all caliber ...
creations-chat 2018-11-05 04:41:55 Banned, that's what Turismo
creations-chat 2018-11-05 04:42:05 No seriously it counts as lag bombing
creations-chat 2018-11-05 05:01:30 Wait I saw that somewhere else
creations-chat 2018-11-05 05:02:43 Dragon, shut it for the love of god, you don't help
creations-chat 2018-11-05 05:03:50 Oh, you are the rightful owner Turismo, nevermind
creations-chat 2018-11-05 05:04:20 Can you clear it up? It seems like you're flipping statements alot
creations-chat 2018-11-05 05:04:38 Do you mean "you did kinda start it, not to hurt your feelings" or "You didn't start it"?
creations-chat 2018-11-05 05:05:48 I just need clarification on that
creations-chat 2018-11-05 05:07:18 TLDR boymahi, Dragon wanted positive and negative magnets and a catapult system, both of which we repeatedly showed evidence that it wouldn't improve the system, to the point where even Superidra got involved, and it turned into a very heated argument because Dragon ignored everyone except himself
creations-chat 2018-11-05 05:07:48 And I nearly got the greenlight to bring down the hammer and just, basically tape everyone's mouth shut, just so people could try to defuse the situation
creations-chat 2018-11-05 05:08:14 If a part 2 starts I'm taping everyone's mouths
creations-chat 2018-11-05 05:08:27 HOW THE HELL IS FONKL STARTING IT!? HE'S WARNING US THAT IT'S ABOUT TO START SO WE CAN __**AVOID**__ IT!
creations-chat 2018-11-05 05:08:51 ... Keep Fonkl out of this, got it?
creations-chat 2018-11-05 05:09:37 .... Dragon, boymahi needed a TLDR and I gave him a TLDR of what the fuck happened, now I'm putting the brakes on this, and if you keep on blaming me, then who's at fault exactly?
creations-chat 2018-11-05 05:11:39 For the love of fuck Dragon, my patience is up with your incomprehensible stupidity, and absolute refusal to understand that the ENTIRE, **GOD DAMN SERVER** __**WAS AGAINST YOU**__
creations-chat 2018-11-05 05:12:00 __**NOW SHUT, THE ACTUAL FLYING FUCK UP, AND TAKE A HINT**__
creations-chat 2018-11-05 05:12:19 Seriously, THE ENTIRE SERVER Dragon, ENTIRE, SERVER
creations-chat 2018-11-05 05:13:01 Sneaky didn't get what he was getting into, Scooby I'm willing to bet you paid or something, and even then that's 3-5 against 10-15 or something within that region
creations-chat 2018-11-05 05:14:04 ... I'm about to make an executive decision here
creations-chat 2018-11-05 05:14:35 Fonkl, boymahi, will you two back me up for, at least temporarily muting this guy, so this argument doesn't happen again?
creations-chat 2018-11-05 05:14:50 It's not a permanent mute, just long enough that this topic passes
creations-chat 2018-11-05 05:15:17 We're all LOOSING OUR COLLECTIVE SHIT AGAINST YOU DRAGON
creations-chat 2018-11-05 05:16:39 Dragon, I can visualize a "new" and "inexperienced" player's view, easily
creations-chat 2018-11-05 05:17:12 Dragon, can you please just shut up and read what WE HAVE TO SAY FOR **ONCE**!?
creations-chat 2018-11-05 05:17:55 Okay that's it, fonkl, boymahi, will you both back me up on muting him?
creations-chat 2018-11-05 05:18:28 .... Welp, alright, I'll follow your cues then fonkl
creations-chat 2018-11-05 05:19:15 DragonMage, for fuck's sake, the complexity is the appeal of this game, if you saw it a few years back, you would've thought it was destined to fail
creations-chat 2018-11-05 05:20:12 People don't go on this game to play Bloxburg, they go on this game to build a vehicle with loose aerodynamic physics that can operate to their preference
creations-chat 2018-11-05 05:24:55 DragonMage, you are, 90% wrong on that, why do you think some suggestions are upvoted that change game mechanics, and some aren't?
creations-chat 2018-11-05 05:25:13 Because those have actual REAL THOUGHT put in them
creations-chat 2018-11-05 05:25:36 Plus that's a good point fonkl, this is Roblox, not Unreal, Unity, Frostbite or whatever AAA engine you're requesting
creations-chat 2018-11-05 05:26:01 This is Roblox, it's held together by duct tape, sticky glue and spit, and yet it's held together
creations-chat 2018-11-05 05:29:00 I'd pick the magnet, see the menu and go "Oh, repel, attract, I know what that does", meanwhile I look at the other two and go "Uhhh, how do these interact?", because while attract and repel are simple words and easy to understand, synonyms of pull and push respectively, the interactions between positively charged and negatively charged blocks is still being investigated by scientists to this date ...
creations-chat 2018-11-05 05:31:17 Dragon, I'll take the one block that attracts AND repels in an, yes unpredictable, but reliable way
creations-chat 2018-11-05 05:31:46 Oh wait, did I describe the current magnets? I believe I did
creations-chat 2018-11-05 05:33:12 ... Dragon, I think you've got the right descriptions, but knowing what you're talking about, you're talking about the wrong ones
creations-chat 2018-11-05 05:33:27 Boymahi, good point, I'm gonna add something to <#491710474786832394>
creations-chat 2018-11-05 05:34:29 Magnets sound more appealing
creations-chat 2018-11-05 05:34:48 Because they're so prevalent in the real world, even as KID TOYS
creations-chat 2018-11-05 05:36:36 "Buggy": Fixed in the next update, infact, probably 90%, if not 100% fixed, and the rest are Roblox engine bugs
"Unpredictable": They can be narrowed down to become predictable, and even then, their only unpredictability is when you jam a ton of magnets together
"Complicated": How complicated is PUSH, and PULL, exactly?
creations-chat 2018-11-05 05:38:27 Doesn't counter my point, their primary function is push and pull, people understand what it does, and when they find something novel, like magnets, they don't just go "I don't understand what this does!", they fiddle around with it
creations-chat 2018-11-05 05:38:51 And if you aren't old enough to understand what strength and range mean, then no offense, but get the fuck off the internet and go back to preschool
creations-chat 2018-11-05 05:40:26 Have you seen anyone else complain about the magnets except for their lag, which has already been fixed by next update?
creations-chat 2018-11-05 05:40:47 People don't care that range is very nebulous, they see it, then they realize the potentials, so they're willing to trial and error it
creations-chat 2018-11-05 05:41:36 And that's gonna be solved by your "solution" how?
creations-chat 2018-11-05 05:41:57 If anything it'll be even less viable to use magnets if they were only positive and negative
creations-chat 2018-11-05 05:42:20 Actually, thought of a point that your idea has, but you haven't iterated upon
creations-chat 2018-11-05 05:43:24 I already posted that suggestion mahina
creations-chat 2018-11-05 05:43:27 Check <#507673335816126509>
creations-chat 2018-11-05 05:44:19 You know what Dragon? I'll literally do a survey right now with people to see if they'd rather have the current magnet or positive vs negative charge
creations-chat 2018-11-05 05:44:31 If you so refuse to see that the second mechanism is ludicrously complicated
creations-chat 2018-11-05 05:45:32 Doing the survey
creations-chat 2018-11-05 05:48:26 So far people say they like the old magnet system
creations-chat 2018-11-05 05:54:38 General consensus Dragon is that the current magnet system's far better
creations-chat 2018-11-05 05:56:06 I did a fucking survey on this stuff across multiple servers of multiple people playing in-game, some of which have barely built their first plane before taking a crack at the magnet system
creations-chat 2018-11-05 05:56:09 .......
creations-chat 2018-11-05 05:56:11 Dragon
creations-chat 2018-11-05 05:56:14 Shut it
creations-chat 2018-11-05 05:56:18 Just, read what I said
creations-chat 2018-11-05 05:56:25 And read each and every single word I typed out
creations-chat 2018-11-05 05:56:52 I took, A, SURVEY, ACROSS MULTIPLE SERVERS
creations-chat 2018-11-05 05:57:08 ...
creations-chat 2018-11-05 05:57:32 Dragon, literally the people you claimed weren't going to use magnets, the people you claimed that would benefit, PREFER THE NORMAL MAGNETS
creations-chat 2018-11-05 06:00:04 ..... Just, shut it Dragon, everyone's sick of your bullshit
creations-chat 2018-11-05 06:00:10 Me in a literal sense
creations-chat 2018-11-05 06:00:54 He hasn't jumped in yet
creations-chat 2018-11-05 06:02:21 ..... When everyone that's involved is tired of you, I'm pretty sure it's a safe bet to claim that everyone else that jumps in, unless you paid them to be a yesman on your side, will agree
creations-chat 2018-11-05 06:02:49 TLDR Future he wants to add positively and negatively charged blocks and we've repeatedly shot down his suggestion, to literally the point of doing a fucking survey that disagrees with him
creations-chat 2018-11-05 06:05:41 That hasn't exactly stopped anyone now has it?
creations-chat 2018-11-05 06:07:23 The only possibility I can see is sifting out garbage, so hopefully if it's added it'll sift out you
creations-chat 2018-11-05 06:08:22 ... You fucking can't read can you?
creations-chat 2018-11-05 06:08:55 I'm out for a while, just gonna throw up from stress
creations-chat 2018-11-05 06:11:44 "COOL"!? HOW IS THAT FUCKING COOL!?
creations-chat 2018-11-05 06:13:40 ... You are one sick person, and not in the good way
creations-chat 2018-11-05 06:14:08 I'm tempted to ping Rick over, but I'd rather not
creations-chat 2018-11-05 06:15:11 <#384021699466756107> I suppose
creations-chat 2018-11-05 06:15:22 Also, Dragon, you're the one going against the 95% group consensus, even with a survey ...
help 2018-11-05 13:03:55 Use folding, that's been the universal Plane Crazy solution to limits all the time
creations-chat 2018-11-05 13:08:25 Madness, I don't think I've seen a revolver yet, specifically with a rotating mechanism, yes I've seen a firearm, but not an actual revolver cylinder
creations-chat 2018-11-05 13:10:09 You might have a shot at inventor depending on what the others say, although I'm leaving it to the others
creations-chat 2018-11-05 13:10:29 I don't doubt it's capable, what I'm questioning is whether the others agree or not
creations-chat 2018-11-05 13:11:05 Eh, I'll leave it up to cook, but if he gets it, he probably gets inventor for a revolver-esque reloading mechanism
creations-chat 2018-11-05 13:11:38 Post a picture?
creations-chat 2018-11-05 13:11:48 Like of what it's modeled after
creations-chat 2018-11-05 13:12:29 Due to new systems, you need votes as well to apply for replicator
creations-chat 2018-11-05 13:13:06 So in other words basically a zombie apocalypse truck?
creations-chat 2018-11-05 13:13:32 Oh wait, I think I see that side drill thing
creations-chat 2018-11-05 13:13:36 Storm chaser?
creations-chat 2018-11-05 13:14:26 Nice
creations-chat 2018-11-05 13:15:15 I would've gone with a canceled out rocket engine to be honest
creations-chat 2018-11-05 13:16:03 Don't forget, pictures appear in <#384025409945337856> when posted here, no matter what type, but I'm cleaning up after ya, don't worry
creations-chat 2018-11-05 13:17:59 Hey, that's the best part of this game, the most pro of the pros and the noobiest of the noobs can happily coexist together and help eachother
creations-chat 2018-11-05 13:18:23 Er, like very few games, what's considered a "dying breed" of games
creations-chat 2018-11-05 13:19:29 One question, why does everyone base their creations off of real life stuff? I know it's easier to picture, but it sorta gets samey to be honest, even if you pick something unique like a storm chaser
creations-chat 2018-11-05 13:19:44 Also, nice KSP jet for your icon
creations-chat 2018-11-05 13:20:24 Oh, if it's from KSP, it's probably a space something, so when I say KSP jet, I probably mean space jet as well
creations-chat 2018-11-05 13:22:34 Try making something unique actually, like once the storm chaser's done
creations-chat 2018-11-05 13:22:56 Pick a design or two you see off the internet, and don't just copy it, but iterate upon it
creations-chat 2018-11-05 13:23:13 I mean, you've had to have done it alot in KSP, right?
creations-chat 2018-11-05 13:24:53 That looks as uncomfortable as fuck to fly in, but I like it because it's so unique compared to what I see mostly, namely with the glass bulb cockpit
creations-chat 2018-11-05 13:26:25 I can already see how to do that, infact I can see how you have infact already done that, but alright, it's still unique
creations-chat 2018-11-05 14:03:19 God damn it ignaciel, save some for the rest of us!
creations-chat 2018-11-05 14:04:21 Now make a fighter, I wanna see your innovation be put into an actual plane
creations-chat 2018-11-05 14:05:53 Knowing you you're gonna make the Intrusion 2 Grabber and punch someone in the face
creations-chat 2018-11-05 14:07:19 Heh, god damn it, now I feel old and behind with my fighter, it's a big and beautiful design sure, but it's not innovative in any way whatsoever, the only saving grace is probably that it's as durable as a flying brick of steel
creations-chat 2018-11-05 15:12:18 What the hell is that even supposed to be?
creations-chat 2018-11-05 15:12:51 So in other words, modular plane building?
creations-chat 2018-11-05 15:13:17 Build one and launch it, I'm tempted to say ignaciel's got modular design already down, but we'll see
creations-chat 2018-11-05 15:14:14 Tiny planes have an advantage of maneuverability, so if it can't get ace and novice pilot, discluding the speed limits, well, I don't think it counts
creations-chat 2018-11-05 15:15:07 Dragon, if it doesn't build a working plane, it's not original, in the slightest
creations-chat 2018-11-05 15:15:33 I'll debate it against ignacioel's modular vehicle system
creations-chat 2018-11-05 15:17:25 I just realized it's not actually a modular plane builder ... Those 3 planes in the back are prebuilt
creations-chat 2018-11-05 15:18:22 I'll settle it when I'm back from classes, but so far I'm leaning towards "no", since ignacioel's was literally hauling huge sections onto an empty frame, yours is just tacking on stuff to a pre-built plane
creations-chat 2018-11-05 15:18:56 And that's if it doesn't shake it's self appart, because of a lack of re-couplers in the current version
creations-chat 2018-11-05 15:19:53 Yes I am being vicious about it, but this is one of the most prized positions out there, so I'm going to be brutal and a half about it
creations-chat 2018-11-05 15:20:20 Read the <#473249376223887371> , no helium for scientist ranks
creations-chat 2018-11-05 15:20:47 Classes now, seeya
help 2018-11-05 17:38:20 It is actually pretty bad believe it or not Dragon ... Primarily because there's so little armoring on the motors, and your missiles are only ground based
help 2018-11-05 17:38:39 Also, there's a glitch called the warp drive Obsidial, I'm not saying how to do it, but the warp drive rank was made because of it
help 2018-11-05 17:39:57 Yeup
help 2018-11-05 17:49:10 Experiment, that's the fun of the game
help 2018-11-05 21:38:47 Pfff, is that the infinite loading thing?
help 2018-11-05 21:39:32 It is, heh, well RIP
the-dump 2018-11-05 22:15:16 Erhm that's, a bit too close EndRage
creations-chat 2018-11-05 22:50:37 Post the save slot Paulo?
help 2018-11-05 23:08:04 2 looks far more interesting to be honest
creations-chat 2018-11-06 00:32:57 So, quick question, has anyone else seen a rope powered drawbridge before?
creations-chat 2018-11-06 00:34:55 Anyone? If not do you think the rope's inventor-worthy?
creations-chat 2018-11-06 00:36:46 Dragon, it's actually pretty frequently used for balloons
creations-chat 2018-11-06 00:37:41 I'm gonna count it for now, but if any mod/admin would like to beg to differ, well, they have the power to do so, and if anyone can show rope being used at an angle far different from what it's supposed to be used for, show me
creations-chat 2018-11-06 00:38:18 Dragon, look at how he's using the rope!
creations-chat 2018-11-06 00:38:27 The reason I didn't count your thing was because I saw it before
creations-chat 2018-11-06 00:38:44 True, but that was his creation as well
creations-chat 2018-11-06 00:39:35 Eh, you're getting better Dragon, still need a few things to work out, but you're getting better
creations-chat 2018-11-06 00:42:53 .____.
creations-chat 2018-11-06 00:42:57 Are you absolutely shitting me?
creations-chat 2018-11-06 00:44:28 Fuck it, someone give ignacioel the "ultimate builder" rank or something
creations-chat 2018-11-06 00:55:39 Maybe the rescue ship actually
creations-chat 2018-11-06 00:57:44 Uh, more like "inve-what the crap is that!?" rank
creations-chat 2018-11-06 00:58:36 Dragon, have you seen what he makes?
creations-chat 2018-11-06 00:59:30 Dragon, challenge him
creations-chat 2018-11-06 00:59:56 I literally challenged him to make this
creations-chat 2018-11-06 00:59:57 https://static.planetminecraft.com/files/resource_media/screenshot/1624/intrusion2-2013-06-12-19-04-56-5310240649.png
creations-chat 2018-11-06 01:00:10 As you can see, while not 100% accurate, he did make it
creations-chat 2018-11-06 01:05:42 https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/enigmata/images/8/81/Illinear.png/revision/latest?cb=20130409122928
creations-chat 2018-11-06 01:05:42 This is what I based my own superfighter off of, but take inspiration from this
creations-chat 2018-11-06 01:05:57 If anyone recognizes it, +10 points
creations-chat 2018-11-06 01:06:21 More specific
creations-chat 2018-11-06 01:06:47 That little fighter is by far one of my most favorite ones in all of gaming, now watch as ignacioel makes a V2 that's even more amazing
creations-chat 2018-11-06 01:08:07 Wrong
creations-chat 2018-11-06 01:08:12 It's the original Enigmata
creations-chat 2018-11-06 01:08:34 Stellar War's the 3rd of the series, more of a base tower defense mix
creations-chat 2018-11-06 01:10:03 I'm not a game mod, and quite frankly that's not dangerous
creations-chat 2018-11-06 01:10:34 My superfighter's no longer going to be super is it?
creations-chat 2018-11-06 01:13:01 This is my superfighter, prized possession, top creation of mine, and starting to get more and more obsolete at this point
creations-chat 2018-11-06 01:15:43 What have I created?
creations-chat 2018-11-06 01:19:19 Picture of the save slot?
creations-chat 2018-11-06 01:19:35 Wait why not?
creations-chat 2018-11-06 01:19:48 Like, pictures are the most secure way of getting block counts
creations-chat 2018-11-06 01:20:28 I mean, think of it as just the ship without it's spray paint
creations-chat 2018-11-06 01:20:33 trollgeni, use custom colors
creations-chat 2018-11-06 01:24:14 Another attempt at inventor?
creations-chat 2018-11-06 01:25:16 Er, that's not quite inventor-worthy truth be told, there's literally 5 block creations, including the seat
creations-chat 2018-11-06 01:25:21 A unique mechanic dude
creations-chat 2018-11-06 01:25:37 You were almost there with the gear mechanism, but sadly you were pretty much second on that one
creations-chat 2018-11-06 01:25:42 Wait
creations-chat 2018-11-06 01:26:32 God freaking damn, it's close, hmmmm
creations-chat 2018-11-06 01:27:11 <@456226577798135808> , I need other opinions on this, what do you think? Does this deserve inventor?
creations-chat 2018-11-06 01:27:53 It is, but, ehhhh, hmmmmmm
creations-chat 2018-11-06 01:28:08 I'm on the fence for this one, I want others' opinions
creations-chat 2018-11-06 01:28:21 Remember that inventor's the peak of the peak of ranks pretty much
creations-chat 2018-11-06 01:28:53 I have yet to see it work without major, MAJOR glitches, and even then only Imperial's gotten it
creations-chat 2018-11-06 01:29:05 Sadly you haven't because your creation was likely uncontrollable
creations-chat 2018-11-06 01:29:14 That's what gets everyone, it needs to go that stupidly high speed and be controllable
creations-chat 2018-11-06 01:29:22 But could it turn reasonably?
creations-chat 2018-11-06 01:29:37 Like, can you fly it away from the spawn, then turn it around and arrive back at the spawn?
creations-chat 2018-11-06 01:29:39 Supersonic
creations-chat 2018-11-06 01:32:02 Ehhhh, again Dragon, I'm on the fence about it
creations-chat 2018-11-06 01:33:01 You got Master, it overrides all the others
creations-chat 2018-11-06 01:33:34 Yeah, that's the rank, master builder, there's other master ranks in other categories
creations-chat 2018-11-06 01:34:08 Dragon, if you think you deserve it, you can probably wait until other mods come on, the whole reason inventor got split in half earlier was because we were too generous
creations-chat 2018-11-06 01:34:18 It's DragonMage's modular plane builder
creations-chat 2018-11-06 01:34:33 That shit, at least partially works! Somehow, it works
creations-chat 2018-11-06 01:34:50 Ehhhhh, sadly no
creations-chat 2018-11-06 01:35:40 F-16, AC-130, M1A1 Abrams, Schwable, those all count
creations-chat 2018-11-06 01:36:51 RAH-66 Comanche, Qaher F-313, those count to, since those were technically built in real life, but they were never massed
creations-chat 2018-11-06 01:36:56 Wait what do you mean Fanta?
creations-chat 2018-11-06 01:37:39 Dude, what do you want me to do Fanta? I had to zoom it out like insanity to fit the whole thing in frame
creations-chat 2018-11-06 01:37:51 That, doesn't count sadly trollgeinu
creations-chat 2018-11-06 01:38:00 It's gotta really closely resemble it
creations-chat 2018-11-06 01:38:22 FantaMaluca321's who I'm referring to
creations-chat 2018-11-06 01:41:06 Pffff, welp
creations-chat 2018-11-06 01:41:25 Mind if I clean the creations up a bit and show you something that'll actually impress people?
creations-chat 2018-11-06 01:41:34 You've got a block count ya know
creations-chat 2018-11-06 01:42:20 https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f7/US_Navy_051105-F-5480T-005_An_F-14D_Tomcat_conducts_a_mission_over_the_Persian_Gulf-region.jpg/1200px-US_Navy_051105-F-5480T-005_An_F-14D_Tomcat_conducts_a_mission_over_the_Persian_Gulf-region.jpg
creations-chat 2018-11-06 01:42:20 Try making this
creations-chat 2018-11-06 01:42:39 It's a swing-wing design
creations-chat 2018-11-06 01:43:52 Vertical Takeoff and Landing, I heard it was Vertical Takeoff Or Landing though, whatever one works
creations-chat 2018-11-06 01:44:35 A video of it taking off and landing entirely vertically please?
creations-chat 2018-11-06 01:46:15 Also try using one of the streamable things
creations-chat 2018-11-06 01:47:00 It needs to take off and land vertically, and I mean from it's normal flight position
creations-chat 2018-11-06 01:47:12 Think of how a heli works, except it's also able to shift it's velocity to primarily forwards as well
creations-chat 2018-11-06 01:50:54 For <#491710474786832394> , the MK2, the MK1 doesn't have the front wings and it's rear wings are smaller
creations-chat 2018-11-06 01:51:37 That's a bit fast for a vertical landing, the takeoff's fine though
creations-chat 2018-11-06 01:52:05 Ehhhhh, work on the landing and I'll count it
creations-chat 2018-11-06 01:56:16 Try to use streamable or something to make it easier
creations-chat 2018-11-06 01:56:40 Every time you put it in that kind of format I have to virus scan it just incase, because I already caught one asshole that tried to send a virus disguised as a Roblox video to my computer
creations-chat 2018-11-06 01:56:56 I'd rather not have that happen to me, so I scan all of those
creations-chat 2018-11-06 01:57:50 Ehhh, fine I'll count it, next time add reverse thrusters though
creations-chat 2018-11-06 01:59:07 Ask the other mods Dragon, but don't spam them please, I'm on the fence, but if they say yes, well, there you go
creations-chat 2018-11-06 01:59:33 There you go you got it epiclolz
creations-chat 2018-11-06 02:01:47 Er, it's Dragon's that's for the inventor
creations-chat 2018-11-06 02:01:53 It's a modular plane building system
creations-chat 2018-11-06 02:02:11 https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/504436696021204992/509176494195736577/RobloxScreenShot20181105_202529999.png
creations-chat 2018-11-06 02:02:11 This thing
creations-chat 2018-11-06 02:02:25 I already scrutinized him over that, he made one that works
creations-chat 2018-11-06 02:02:40 https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/384025409945337856/509176187223015434/RobloxScreenShot20181105_202328448.png
creations-chat 2018-11-06 02:03:53 It's nice tank
creations-chat 2018-11-06 02:04:02 I mean, there's also this Orange
creations-chat 2018-11-06 02:04:03 https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/384025409945337856/509176213168979998/RobloxScreenShot20181105_202343809.png
creations-chat 2018-11-06 02:04:25 Ah
creations-chat 2018-11-06 02:04:47 Well, true, you know what, just get the video tomorrow Dragon
creations-chat 2018-11-06 02:06:02 That was me that did it
creations-chat 2018-11-06 02:06:32 It actually worked at angles I would not have expected it to work on at all
creations-chat 2018-11-06 02:09:36 Meh, not the best but, I suppose so
creations-chat 2018-11-06 02:13:49 Dragon, just record it please
creations-chat 2018-11-06 02:20:00 Include the takeoff I suppose
creations-chat 2018-11-06 02:21:11 Dragon, do you want it or not, also ignacioel, how!?
creations-chat 2018-11-06 02:23:54 Alright, well, g'night ignacioel
creations-chat 2018-11-06 03:48:13 Oh boy
creations-chat 2018-11-06 03:52:08 Er, sure, hold on
creations-chat 2018-11-06 03:55:14 Er, hold on
creations-chat 2018-11-06 03:55:27 Ah, sorry
creations-chat 2018-11-06 04:15:09 What happened?
creations-chat 2018-11-06 04:21:38 Well then, huuuuhhhh, that's very impressive
creations-chat 2018-11-06 05:56:56 VTOL cappable I'm guessing?
creations-chat 2018-11-06 06:02:32 I have a feeling it's not too durable, mainly considering the low block count
creations-chat 2018-11-06 06:03:40 I'll show you my MK2 combat fighter
creations-chat 2018-11-06 06:03:57 Since the rocket update it's been revamped, so all the jets were replaced with super rockets
creations-chat 2018-11-06 06:04:12 It turns on a dime, it's as tough as a brick and it's pretty fast to
creations-chat 2018-11-06 06:04:29 It even has reverse thrust
creations-chat 2018-11-06 06:06:09 Oh yeah, since it was before the arena update, the cockpit's a solid model, so it's slightly hard to aim, but at the same time it's a solid model
creations-chat 2018-11-06 06:08:33 He must've engineered it well then, because as he lost parts, it all balanced out, so while it may've slightly affected his performance, it wouldn't have crippled him
creations-chat 2018-11-06 06:10:34 The hell? Huh, never had that happen
creations-chat 2018-11-06 06:21:35 Yes I do, but can you remind me tomorrow? I'm getting really tired now
creations-chat 2018-11-07 03:50:01 What's the issue? Dragon's horrible at explaining
creations-chat 2018-11-07 03:50:11 Also, nice My Hero Academia icon
creations-chat 2018-11-07 03:50:42 Dragon, you are infact horrible at explaining, do we need to point out what the hell happened in <#491710474786832394> again? Or can we lay that to rest?
creations-chat 2018-11-07 03:52:43 For the love of god ... If you still think I'm bullying you, just, I don't even know what to say anymore
creations-chat 2018-11-07 03:58:22 DRAGON, for fuck's sake, you say to stop and here you are, TLDR he suggested replacing the current magnet system, which he found "confusing" "glitchy" and "laggy", the last one being fixed next update, which is soon, with a positive and negative magnet system
creations-chat 2018-11-07 03:58:53 The entire server disagreed, and he's still harping on about it to this date ...
creations-chat 2018-11-07 03:59:50 Dragon, you saw what happened to Cube, do you want the same thing to happen to you?
creations-chat 2018-11-07 04:00:10 What I'm saying is, can you please drop it, and play nice
creations-chat 2018-11-07 04:00:26 TLDR Cube harassed the entire server after I flushed him out of harassing the testing server
creations-chat 2018-11-07 04:01:40 ... I'm gonna start logging this down, I'd suggest you stop, like now
creations-chat 2018-11-07 04:02:12 Whatever it is it's obnoxious
creations-chat 2018-11-07 04:02:40 Dragon, I am still sick, I lost two fucking pounds over a week
creations-chat 2018-11-07 04:02:54 Now can you please just stop, my funny bone is as good as dead for now
creations-chat 2018-11-07 04:03:16 DRAGON, can you please
creations-chat 2018-11-07 04:03:41 ...... You aren't taking this seriously are you?
creations-chat 2018-11-07 04:04:05 Fuck it, I'm out
creations-chat 2018-11-07 04:05:16 Shoot, use downwards engines
creations-chat 2018-11-07 04:05:30 I'd suggest using rocket engines, as those can only go one direction and can't be counted as assistance
creations-chat 2018-11-07 04:06:06 Dragon made a modular plane building system, that's how
creations-chat 2018-11-07 04:07:05 I am fucking sick Dragon, NOW CAN YOU NOT!? Until I get better I'm taking everything seriously ...
creations-chat 2018-11-07 04:07:58 For the love of fuck, just end it now
creations-chat 2018-11-07 04:08:38 He's got nitro, he has custom emotes
creations-chat 2018-11-07 04:08:49 You can tell he has nitro because his icon's a gif, rather than a static picture
creations-chat 2018-11-07 05:15:41 Ghost, be careful with that
creations-chat 2018-11-07 05:15:52 That's pretty easily bannable, mostly due to the excessive lag that the sheer amount of rockets causes
creations-chat 2018-11-07 05:17:14 It's not just the particles that does it sneaky, if it was that easy then nobody would complain about it
creations-chat 2018-11-07 05:18:45 If I had to guess I'd say it's Roblox physics trying to update at a high enough rate
help 2018-11-07 05:27:32 Your center of lift is too far back, center of mass too far forwards, so you need to dedicate too much to just pulling up
help 2018-11-07 05:27:47 You can also rotate and use jets in different directions
help 2018-11-07 05:27:55 So try adding a pair of up and down jets on the wingtips
creations-chat 2018-11-07 05:33:47 This is a chat for creations, if you submit a picture of a creation, various videos or whatnot, it'll get dragged via bot over to <#384025409945337856>
creations-chat 2018-11-07 05:34:08 So <#384025409945337856> is moreso the gallery of what people have made, <#504436696021204992> is moreso talking about what people have made
creations-chat 2018-11-07 05:34:34 Yeup
creations-chat 2018-11-07 05:46:54 Ah
creations-chat 2018-11-07 05:47:04 The hangar part is already made, but the actual craft?
creations-chat 2018-11-07 05:47:35 Ehhhhh, it's actually unique enough in my book, gonna leave it up to others' decisions though
creations-chat 2018-11-07 05:48:32 Heh, Dragon, that's a bit excessive, modeler only requires a unique looking craft
creations-chat 2018-11-07 05:48:46 Although you're getting there, sorta
creations-chat 2018-11-07 05:49:00 Not inventor, modeler
creations-chat 2018-11-07 05:49:20 Look above
creations-chat 2018-11-07 05:49:35 "I was thinking modeler but k"
creations-chat 2018-11-07 05:53:42 I'll crank it through a GIF converter for you

creations-chat 2018-11-07 05:55:09 Not a problem, try using Streamable
help 2018-11-07 05:59:00 Not me, but I think when the others are on they can send techniques, if you aren't on when they're on, ask them to DM me, and I can then message you when you're on
creations-chat 2018-11-08 01:38:59 Part count?
creations-chat 2018-11-08 01:40:26 Show a picture?
creations-chat 2018-11-08 01:45:03 Try building bigger or more unique things
help 2018-11-08 01:57:48 Magnet engines in theory, but those are very elegant designs, like, ludicrously so
help 2018-11-08 02:09:10 Soooo, Dragon, try toning it back a bit, you're being a bit, I guess blunt and open about it
help 2018-11-08 02:12:43 Yeaahhh, just try to be nice and helpful to people, like, instead of calling me over, just DM me who needs what rank
creations-chat 2018-11-08 03:50:00 A bomb can be literally anything that's dropped from your plane
creations-chat 2018-11-08 03:54:06 5 bombs on a target
creations-chat 2018-11-08 03:54:07 That's it
creations-chat 2018-11-08 03:55:55 Still counts
creations-chat 2018-11-08 03:57:51 5 bombs of any sort dropped onto someone ...
creations-chat 2018-11-08 04:03:59 I'd say video, but if you can drop a sufficient amount of payload, screenshot would be fine
creations-chat 2018-11-08 04:04:17 Basically, either accuracy or just plain flattening the area via mass bombs
creations-chat 2018-11-08 04:12:37 For the love of, use Streamable please or something that converts to gifs!
creations-chat 2018-11-08 04:13:11 You hit him, try to actually nail the bombs ON him next time
creations-chat 2018-11-08 04:13:15 But don't crash
creations-chat 2018-11-08 04:17:24 Niiice, post a blockcount?
creations-chat 2018-11-08 04:23:08 I'll let the others decide on inventor or not, a bit tired and burned out now
creations-chat 2018-11-08 04:25:56 I'll let the rank speak for it's self
help 2018-11-08 05:54:39 That's why I've been asking for block counts
help 2018-11-08 05:55:01 Specifically to show how many leftover helium blocks there are
help 2018-11-08 05:57:19 That's literally what the build list is or and why I ask for the block count
help 2018-11-08 06:00:00 Ahem
help 2018-11-08 06:00:53 C4RAB, it literally solves the problem right there and then, and I do ask them to place down blocks to update the value, so they can't just hope for a glitch
creations-chat 2018-11-09 00:21:40 Block count?
creations-chat 2018-11-09 00:21:49 Dragon, it can definitely fly ...
creations-chat 2018-11-09 00:21:58 I can already tell from the wings' positioning, alongside the engines
creations-chat 2018-11-09 00:22:20 After witnessing alot of creations you can actually learn which ones fly and which ones don't purely via eyeballing it, and you can get good part estimates to
creations-chat 2018-11-09 00:22:58 Look at the engines on the underbelly
creations-chat 2018-11-09 00:23:29 Those are angled at a slightly odd angle, meaning they're all on some form of motor
creations-chat 2018-11-09 00:24:12 I already did it, sorta did a rough block count via looking it over as well
creations-chat 2018-11-09 00:33:45 Alright, cool, what for exactly?
creations-chat 2018-11-09 00:39:34 Any rank requests or just wanna show off?
creations-chat 2018-11-09 00:56:21 Show the thing Lansink?
creations-chat 2018-11-09 00:57:14 I think so
creations-chat 2018-11-09 01:30:07 Looks pretty nice
creations-chat 2018-11-09 03:09:16 Radars aren't picking up anything, is it a fluke? On a more serious note, nice job with the bombs
creations-chat 2018-11-09 05:37:50 Bio, try using motors to rotate the engines
help 2018-11-09 08:19:10 It's actually going to possibly be updated soon, but basically it's Roblox color palette limitations, it defaults to a certain few core colors
help 2018-11-09 08:19:27 Saves a bit of data, kinda murders colors
help 2018-11-09 08:19:49 And if you haven't noticed by the giant "OMG" turret we saw earlier, people are starting to get crunched in terms of data
creations-chat 2018-11-09 22:43:44 Just capture a picture of it's speed going dumb levels of fast
creations-chat 2018-11-09 22:44:44 There
creations-chat 2018-11-09 22:47:22 I don't think light speed's exactly difficult anymore
creations-chat 2018-11-09 22:47:57 Not even that, just get a glitch that flings you
creations-chat 2018-11-09 22:48:29 Nada, sorry, not horizontal, and it's not enough to get the other ranks
creations-chat 2018-11-09 22:49:00 SirNoHate
help 2018-11-09 22:50:42 You bother Rick about that, and even then he's very, very busy, just post it under <#498473314445033472> for him to view later, without pinging him
creations-chat 2018-11-09 23:01:23 Show a block count Dust?
creations-chat 2018-11-09 23:02:28 Via picture, not via message
creations-chat 2018-11-09 23:02:55 God freaking, it's hard to see how many blocks it is so I can't give a rough estimate
creations-chat 2018-11-09 23:03:16 Either that or I'm really tired in many ways
creations-chat 2018-11-09 23:03:18 Yeah

bug-reports 2018-11-09 23:22:13 I have a feeling it's everyone trying to hit lightspeed that's doing it

creations-chat 2018-11-10 00:54:47 Done

the-dump 2018-11-10 04:19:43 If we made that then this wouldn't be a Roblox-applicable server anymore

creations-chat 2018-11-10 05:01:40 What counts as a "bomb" isn't specified, so the fact that you went with ballasts is a plus
creations-chat 2018-11-10 05:05:21 You're at 9 digits, you need 1 more then to hit 6 with the first one
creations-chat 2018-11-10 05:10:42 Want any ranks or just to show off?
creations-chat 2018-11-10 05:11:05 Use motors to fold stuff
creations-chat 2018-11-10 05:11:23 Think of your creation like a piece of paper, then fold it like an origami, and place motors along the fold points
creations-chat 2018-11-10 05:11:45 Imperial learned some stupid magic that makes his aircraft even better than that, but I doubt he's teaching

creations-chat 2018-11-10 22:33:03 Pfffff, I don't think that counts sadly
creations-chat 2018-11-10 22:33:24 +10 points for creativity and thoughtfulness, but I thought you meant parking your blimp on a carrier

creations-chat 2018-11-10 23:14:28 Just take a picture of your save slot

creations-chat 2018-11-10 23:20:01 I'll check myself
creations-chat 2018-11-10 23:20:21 Still need the block count
creations-chat 2018-11-10 23:20:32 Post the save slot snoopy?
creations-chat 2018-11-10 23:20:55 Royal, I literally said "master designer you've already got"
creations-chat 2018-11-10 23:21:20 Snoopy, post the save slot like Unique did, then I can judge it
creations-chat 2018-11-10 23:21:42 Ehhhh, I'll do a rough count, but I'll low-ball it, okay?
creations-chat 2018-11-10 23:22:08 There, you got a low estimate on block count from me
creations-chat 2018-11-10 23:23:29 Largest one, whichever one you want me to base the rank off of
creations-chat 2018-11-10 23:23:48 ._.
creations-chat 2018-11-10 23:24:05 Do I even need to argue that that's modeler-worthy?
creations-chat 2018-11-10 23:24:30 Congrats Erick, you got modeler for that
creations-chat 2018-11-10 23:25:18 That is one hell of an impressive plane, well done Erick
creations-chat 2018-11-10 23:25:43 Or, impressive, whatever it is to be honest

creations-chat 2018-11-10 23:28:02 Uhhh, engines being used for lift on the sides, sorry but no
creations-chat 2018-11-11 00:24:58 Done, and no idea
creations-chat 2018-11-11 01:00:21 The new rockets act like homing missiles, although their homing is a close proximity
creations-chat 2018-11-11 01:01:32 They're probably not working because they're arena weapons

creations-chat 2018-11-11 03:41:45 Yeah cody, also, I haven't played in a while, so forgive me, but why is the top row above the 4 missing a few pixels?
creations-chat 2018-11-11 03:45:00 Ah
creations-chat 2018-11-11 03:45:12 It's just the menus acting weird, alright
creations-chat 2018-11-11 03:45:54 Nah, the +14 means there's 14 digits
creations-chat 2018-11-11 03:46:21 Example: 5 E+2 = 500
creations-chat 2018-11-11 03:58:29 God damn ._. mx, show us it being used, we're practically dying for a demo of something like that
creations-chat 2018-11-11 03:59:02 Dude, mxdanger, look at <#384025409945337856> , people are being awestruck by that
bug-reports 2018-11-11 04:01:43 1: It's accurate enough as it is, there's a pretty generous lock-on, and

help 2018-11-11 23:46:46 I think larger creations have less of an effect compared to smaller ones
bug-reports 2018-11-11 23:50:10 It seems to affect larger craft less than smaller ones, at least, from what I can tell
bug-reports 2018-11-11 23:51:10 My 1K superfighter has a tilt, but it's so minor that unless I afk for an hour, it doesn't bother me at all, even while trying to land on a carrier

creations-chat 2018-11-12 03:34:19 I mean, you've made the Grabber, a crab truck, a cargo variant of my superfighter, you would've earned modeler like 10 times over by this point I think

creations-chat 2018-11-12 03:37:29 I mean, the battleship is massive and impressive, don't get me wrong
creations-chat 2018-11-12 03:45:13 Knowing ignacioel, he probably is
creations-chat 2018-11-12 03:53:48 You could layer it with disconnectors and fake an impact
creations-chat 2018-11-12 04:02:48 Other creations' interactions are weird
creations-chat 2018-11-12 04:03:07 Like, I've parked my superfighter on someone's carrier a long while ago, and they wound up bouncing me into orbit

creations-chat 2018-11-12 21:46:03 I think real life, and even then you might wanna add the turrets
creations-chat 2018-11-12 21:46:10 Otherwise it's impressive
creations-chat 2018-11-12 21:46:17 Like, one that actually flies in real life
creations-chat 2018-11-12 22:05:00 Steredenn Tempest (The yellow/black fighter)
creations-chat 2018-11-12 22:06:53 Jaws, ignore it
creations-chat 2018-11-13 01:34:57 He doesn't have to unless he wants ranks
creations-chat 2018-11-13 01:35:28 If I had to guess I'd say it qualifies for advanced
creations-chat 2018-11-13 01:37:54 I mean, the fusilage alone is probably something like ~100-150, maybe ~175 if you wanna push it? Not to mention I see space for internals, alongside the actual wings and such
creations-chat 2018-11-13 01:39:13 ... I'm giving an estimate without the part count, OF COURSE I'M JUDGEMENTAL YA DUMB SHIT

creations-chat 2018-11-14 05:04:03 Saw it, nice
help 2018-11-14 12:16:17 It's probably Roblox acting weird, another game for me said that, so I don't think it's only Plane Crazy for everyone, rather everyone has a problem game
help 2018-11-14 12:17:32 Like using 3 people in the server as an example, Orangeskii might have problem with Phantom Forces, C4RAB might have problems with Jailbreak, and Dusttiiii might have problems with Plane Crazy as well
bug-reports 2018-11-14 13:33:40 When a plane hits the bottom of the world in arena mode, it glitches it out for everyone
bug-reports 2018-11-14 13:37:54 Arena guns can still hit the player model, which means you can absoluetly ruin yourself if your gun placement is too close to the cockpit
creations-chat 2018-11-14 15:20:38 Use Streamable please, it makes it easier to watch
creations-chat 2018-11-14 15:27:15 Use it like this

creations-chat 2018-11-14 15:27:31 There we go
creations-chat 2018-11-14 15:27:35 There's your video now
creations-chat 2018-11-14 15:27:56 Not a problem
creations-chat 2018-11-14 15:41:39 Check the pinned stuff
creations-chat 2018-11-14 15:49:53 Gonna check it with the others
creations-chat 2018-11-14 15:50:30 I personally say yes, because nobody's built an obby before, and nobody's built an object contained within a self-expanding cube that can in theory be compressed together
creations-chat 2018-11-14 15:51:09 Now carry it in a truck and I'm willing to be 100% yes
creations-chat 2018-11-14 17:52:47 Point out which others I have to check out?
creations-chat 2018-11-14 18:08:37 Oh that one, uhhhh
creations-chat 2018-11-14 18:09:08 Checking now
creations-chat 2018-11-14 20:28:53 I was on a Terraria break, next time, can you please read the <#384021699466756107> chat?
creations-chat 2018-11-14 20:29:41 Yeaaahhhh, that's what's limiting you alot kiri
creations-chat 2018-11-14 20:30:23 I think they voted you're inventor-worthy Skaara
creations-chat 2018-11-14 20:30:33 Actually yeah, inventor-worthy
creations-chat 2018-11-14 20:30:47 Tada, done
creations-chat 2018-11-14 20:32:59 He made a cube that expands, revealing an obby in the middle of it
creations-chat 2018-11-15 00:22:13 jacob, let me clarify
creations-chat 2018-11-15 00:22:19 GUYS!!!!
creations-chat 2018-11-15 00:22:29 Right, jacob, you're a bit new here, so let me explain what he did and why
creations-chat 2018-11-15 00:22:36 Jacob, just let me explain
creations-chat 2018-11-15 00:22:43 ...
creations-chat 2018-11-15 00:22:54 __**LET ME EXPLAIN BEFORE YOU ASSUME STUFF JACOB**__
creations-chat 2018-11-15 00:23:18 How are you supposed to know if you're helping if you don't know what's going on exactly?
creations-chat 2018-11-15 00:23:36 ...
creations-chat 2018-11-15 00:23:57 Tank, admittedly you're a bit eager to swing the hammer
creations-chat 2018-11-15 00:24:01 ...
creations-chat 2018-11-15 00:24:17 Right, Jacob, DMs, now, rest of you can you please try to calm down while I explain it to him?
creations-chat 2018-11-15 00:24:56 I think he might've blocked me ...
creations-chat 2018-11-15 00:25:16 He's still in it, he has the roles
creations-chat 2018-11-15 00:25:30 ..... Look in <#497142796961054721>
creations-chat 2018-11-15 00:28:08 Anyone mind me giving him a warn?
creations-chat 2018-11-15 00:28:27 Jacob, then LISTEN UP
creations-chat 2018-11-15 00:28:45 I'm dragging this to DMs, not for my own personal sake, but so it's just you and me, got it?
creations-chat 2018-11-15 00:29:04 ... Then freaking listen, and it might not be annoying anymore
creations-chat 2018-11-15 00:29:12 And maybe you'd like to open your DMs temporarily?
creations-chat 2018-11-15 00:29:23 That's, better, ish
creations-chat 2018-11-15 00:29:51 ...
creations-chat 2018-11-15 00:29:53 Jacob
creations-chat 2018-11-15 00:30:01 Get to DMs, now, and I'm going to make it easy with you
creations-chat 2018-11-15 00:30:17 Get to the DMs, and I'll explain what's going on, so you don't wind up screwing everything up
creations-chat 2018-11-15 00:31:00 ........
creations-chat 2018-11-15 00:31:37 Dragon, he tried to pick on Fanta, and even tried to falsely warn him
creations-chat 2018-11-15 00:31:53 If you think that's "bullying", then clearly you've got some screwed up definition of bullying
creations-chat 2018-11-15 00:32:38 ... Dragon, just stay out of this, no matter how much explaining I do, you won't get it
creations-chat 2018-11-15 00:32:58 You have never gotten it infact, so just stay out of these conversations before you burry your nose into a mousetrap
creations-chat 2018-11-15 00:33:10 Jacobboss, then how about you listen up
creations-chat 2018-11-15 00:33:17 And actually acknowledge that you're listening
creations-chat 2018-11-15 00:33:31 You can if you want to stay in the server Dragon
creations-chat 2018-11-15 00:33:44 But anyways, do you understand what I mean Jacob?
creations-chat 2018-11-15 00:34:04 Riiiight, explanation time
creations-chat 2018-11-15 00:34:18 For roles, which are sorta like award badges, we need block counts most of the time
creations-chat 2018-11-15 00:34:32 If you look in <#473249376223887371> , you may notice a bunch of roles require block counts
creations-chat 2018-11-15 00:34:53 ... You don't without permission from a mod, it's so we can tell who you are easily
creations-chat 2018-11-15 00:35:34 Anyways, if you look in ranks, many of them require block counts, we can't accurately determine block counts just by counting, as with the size of creations recently, and the various blocks, it's very difficult
creations-chat 2018-11-15 00:35:42 So instead what we do is we rely on save slots, which post a block count
creations-chat 2018-11-15 00:36:10 Do you understand somewhat now jacob?
creations-chat 2018-11-15 00:37:18 That hasn't been a problem yet to be honest, and even then, how would that work out exactly?
creations-chat 2018-11-15 00:37:45 Making the background transparent wouldn't do anything, because they could just paint a picture of their supposed "super craft"
creations-chat 2018-11-15 00:38:08 Taking a picture's very, very hard to do, and would probably cut off a bit of save data, which is pretty important
creations-chat 2018-11-15 00:56:12 Hey! AWACs design, nice
help 2018-11-15 01:00:22 I actually did, but that's after he tried harassing me in the DMs
help 2018-11-15 01:00:35 So it's provoked swearing to be honest
creations-chat 2018-11-15 01:01:40 Totten, can you please not, we've seen your creation and all of it's various repaints like 30 times, at least once daily now
creations-chat 2018-11-15 01:02:09 ... It's technically applying to the rules, so I'll let it stay, but can you please, just condense it into one list?
creations-chat 2018-11-15 01:02:12 ....
creations-chat 2018-11-15 01:02:51 Now that is actually good Fanta, it's something that's actually built to function, rather than just act as a huge block
creations-chat 2018-11-15 01:03:42 I think it's just a pair of wedges, uninteresting
creations-chat 2018-11-15 01:03:48 A very large repeating pattern
creations-chat 2018-11-15 01:04:02 Look at Fanta's compared to yours
creations-chat 2018-11-15 01:04:11 His has at least some form of structure and design
creations-chat 2018-11-15 01:04:28 ...?
creations-chat 2018-11-15 01:06:32 Calm the hell down, we've already taken action
help 2018-11-15 01:25:29 For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction
creations-chat 2018-11-15 02:51:16 Warp drive, not speed demon
creations-chat 2018-11-15 04:01:10 Show me the vehicle? Ground based ones have X2 block requirements
creations-chat 2018-11-15 04:04:22 Yeah, didn't factor that in?
creations-chat 2018-11-15 04:04:49 At the very least you get lag machine, at most you'll get server exterminator
creations-chat 2018-11-15 04:04:59 If it flies or is designed for primarily naval transportation, you get exterminator
creations-chat 2018-11-15 04:05:03 Otherwise, lag machine
creations-chat 2018-11-15 04:08:24 Ehhhh, alright, I'll judge the final part tomorrow
creations-chat 2018-11-15 06:42:24 It's pretty nice
creations-chat 2018-11-15 18:43:56 They have attempted that before
creations-chat 2018-11-15 18:44:06 Most notably people have made Star Destroyers before
creations-chat 2018-11-15 18:44:26 Dude, this is Plane Crazy, if it's within the general realm of reason, it'll probably be able to fly
creations-chat 2018-11-15 18:45:19 Nope
help 2018-11-15 18:54:28 ?
help 2018-11-15 18:54:38 Show me?
help 2018-11-15 18:54:44 DOH! I SEE IT!
help 2018-11-15 18:54:52 Fixed
creations-chat 2018-11-15 19:06:00 Er, 1, how many parts? 2: You need to be upvoted as well, 3: The seat's the wrong way around, 4: Your scaling's way off
creations-chat 2018-11-15 19:06:22 Quite literally that little wooden thing you see in the middle is the entire seat the person is supposed to sit on
creations-chat 2018-11-15 19:07:04 If you want ranks for it, please also include the block count
creations-chat 2018-11-15 19:09:17 Er, different views?
creations-chat 2018-11-15 19:10:25 Post a picture of the save slot, that's a more surefire way of getting the block count
creations-chat 2018-11-15 19:10:57 Got it
creations-chat 2018-11-15 19:13:25 Ranks given
creations-chat 2018-11-15 19:14:04 You don't mind if I give negative critique? You did nice with the motors and the cockpit, but there are a couple of things
creations-chat 2018-11-15 19:14:32 Like, so you can improve upon it later
help 2018-11-15 19:16:24 To suggest things, do &suggest (Your suggestion)
help 2018-11-15 19:16:31 Within the <#491710474786832394> channel
creations-chat 2018-11-15 19:20:06 Gamer, right, here's the thing, you need to replicate an actual vehicle
creations-chat 2018-11-15 19:20:43 Examples of replicatable vehicles: F-16, B-52, M1A1 Abrams, the Bismarck battleship
creations-chat 2018-11-15 19:20:54 It's sort of a silent rule that we didn't think we had to spell out
creations-chat 2018-11-15 19:21:20 Just grab a picture of a modern or past vehicle and build something that looks like it
creations-chat 2018-11-15 19:21:58 And do a bit of research on it, if it's got turrets, we expect them to at least swivel, and if it's got VTOL capabilities, we expect VTOL capabilities in similar ways
creations-chat 2018-11-15 19:23:39 Hey, nobody said replicator was easy
creations-chat 2018-11-15 19:27:28 I can already see it doesn't fit the 500+ block requirement
creations-chat 2018-11-15 19:27:49 Wait no wrong one
creations-chat 2018-11-15 19:27:53 I was thinking modeler/inventor
creations-chat 2018-11-15 19:28:31 If you can get someone else's vote on it, without pressuring them to do so, I suppose you'll get novice
creations-chat 2018-11-15 19:28:38 But for crud's sake, make a plane dude, how hard is it?
creations-chat 2018-11-15 19:28:56 Get a fighter, WW2 monoplanes tend to be the easiest, and model it in Plane Crazy
creations-chat 2018-11-15 19:31:41 It'd help if you knew how to spell it out, you even spelled it out correctly in the Roblox save, which brings up a question, was it really you?
creations-chat 2018-11-15 19:32:21 Because if so, you knew how to spell it before, infact you nailed it perfectly, yet you screw it up on the Discord server, not even bothering to fix it
creations-chat 2018-11-15 19:32:53 So let me ask again, are your creations really yours, or are you getting them off of someone else?
creations-chat 2018-11-15 19:36:42 Dude
creations-chat 2018-11-15 19:36:59 I'm compelled to NOT upvote it because you're practically in my face about it
creations-chat 2018-11-15 19:37:54 You're mispelling skateboard again
creations-chat 2018-11-15 19:38:02 ...
creations-chat 2018-11-15 19:38:21 Dude, seriously, give up on these minimal effort builds and put some actual effort into it
creations-chat 2018-11-15 19:38:36 If you didn't notice with my replicator list, we also included land vehicles
creations-chat 2018-11-15 19:38:50 But you can't make a generic box and go "fiat", you need to put some EFFORT in
creations-chat 2018-11-15 19:39:25 You just put down alot of single blocks and some wheels ... that's not really effort
creations-chat 2018-11-15 19:40:09 THIS is effort, 1K+ blocks, all able to fly so comfortably that you can fall asleep at the stick and still fly to your destination, it's effort in engineering and design
creations-chat 2018-11-15 19:40:26 Putting down single blocks, that's not effort
creations-chat 2018-11-15 19:41:02 ... Gamer, give it up and put some actual effort in, nobody's going to be impressed by "scate" boards
creations-chat 2018-11-15 19:41:14 Unless you can actually make it do a legitimate kickflip or something
creations-chat 2018-11-15 20:14:58 That is just god damn creative oslo, well done
help 2018-11-15 21:35:32 Only in arena mode
creations-chat 2018-11-15 21:58:19 Love the wheelie it does
creations-chat 2018-11-15 22:44:27 Post a picture of the block count, and show your name please
creations-chat 2018-11-15 22:45:13 Due to recent copying and picture stealing issues, we've had to implement a new rule that you have to show your username alongside your craft somewhere within the picture
creations-chat 2018-11-15 22:45:35 We wouldn't have had to have done this if certain people didn't copy others' creations ... Blame them for ruining it for everyone
creations-chat 2018-11-15 22:46:09 Done
creations-chat 2018-11-15 22:53:39 Then check to see if others have already suggested your suggestions
creations-chat 2018-11-15 22:54:47 He, went a bit overboard with a suggestions flood
creations-chat 2018-11-16 00:37:19 Show your username on the screen to prove it's yours?
creations-chat 2018-11-16 00:38:53 Sadly it's a precaution we had to take after people started stealing other people's images of their creations
creations-chat 2018-11-16 00:39:05 Also, Ignacioel, how the heck do you keep on making these things?
creations-chat 2018-11-16 00:39:45 Cool, doesn't follow the steampunk engineer rank, but it's still pretty cool
creations-chat 2018-11-16 00:40:33 It maintains lift via helium, engines used to maneuver only
creations-chat 2018-11-16 00:44:13 ... Paul, seriously?
creations-chat 2018-11-16 00:44:30 Please tell me that's a joke ...
creations-chat 2018-11-16 00:46:14 It doesn't have to be serious you know
bug-reports 2018-11-16 00:53:08 Right, clear it up here
bug-reports 2018-11-16 00:53:26 Flame, wargamechap, you're both wrong, it's not a glitch, it's an intentional feature so you can see how much damage you can do
bug-reports 2018-11-16 00:53:54 But it's clientside only, meaning only you can can only see how much damage you do
creations-chat 2018-11-16 00:54:18 It sent

bug-reports 2018-11-16 00:54:39 "Flame, __**wargamechap**__"
bug-reports 2018-11-16 00:54:52 I never said plzkilmenow, I said wargamechap
bug-reports 2018-11-16 00:55:57 Wargamechap, don't just bomb around doing that, you only look like an annoying troll if you do
creations-chat 2018-11-16 00:57:21 Both pictures sent smokey
creations-chat 2018-11-16 00:57:25 On both channels
creations-chat 2018-11-16 00:58:12 Welp, that'd explain how you make those things constantly
creations-chat 2018-11-16 00:59:38 I'd love to see an autoloaded coaxial turret, I know someone made an absurdly huge coaxial turret, but I think it was single shot, not autoloaded
creations-chat 2018-11-16 01:00:31 Think a battleship's turret, it's got multiple barrels on it
creations-chat 2018-11-16 01:00:54 Also for autoloaders, think of how an assault rifle works
creations-chat 2018-11-16 01:01:35 Basically a turret that's magazine fed
help 2018-11-16 01:30:34 We seriously need an in-game mod tag ... or just, SOMETHING
help 2018-11-16 01:33:25 I think it's long overdue, mainly considering how popular Plane Crazy is

help 2018-11-16 01:35:17 You royally fluffed your chances at being a mod Dragon, so sorry, but not a chance
creations-chat 2018-11-16 01:39:51 You need to detach stages with decouplers
help 2018-11-16 01:40:06 Tank was never blocked in the first place
help 2018-11-16 01:40:47 ... Dragon, that's very immature, and you know that right?
help 2018-11-16 01:43:47 Because he has an opinion that counters your opinion?
help 2018-11-16 01:49:51 How about 1 week to a month, but it varies depending on public and other mod opinions on him? Basically if he's this glowing symbol of glorious awesome, he only has to be Discord mod for 1 week before bumping into game mod, but if he's on the edge of being booted from being a mod, a month
creations-chat 2018-11-16 02:56:04 If thatcat gets on here, he'll get the rank to
creations-chat 2018-11-16 02:56:57 Oh, didn't see him, whops
help 2018-11-16 03:29:27 You may use engines to make a ship move
creations-chat 2018-11-16 04:24:42 Done
help 2018-11-16 06:51:27 Which rank?
help 2018-11-16 06:52:19 For the love of, gamer, we agreed it wasn't replicator-worthy due to it's oversimplicity and inability to function anything more than just as a car
help 2018-11-16 06:53:32 Your own vote doesn't count mind you
help 2018-11-16 06:53:47 Who the hell is happy?
help 2018-11-16 06:54:13 ... A freaking alt I'd imagine
help 2018-11-16 06:54:51 4-5 in a row and it's considered spamming
help 2018-11-16 06:54:58 Happy is no longer in this server
help 2018-11-16 06:55:20 So I'm gonna knock off his vote, since he's no longer able to alter his vote, seems fair?
help 2018-11-16 06:55:34 Plus he has the vanilla Discord icon
bug-reports 2018-11-16 06:56:35 Seems like the other way around, my MK2 gets even faster in the arena
help 2018-11-16 06:56:58 gamer, put some freaking effort into your creations, we've all agreed that it's not replicator-worthy
help 2018-11-16 06:57:39 ... You really are freaking blunt about it aren't you?
creations-chat 2018-11-16 06:57:59 Nice, I can see it's got enough space
help 2018-11-16 06:58:31 Gamer, make it do a kickflip and land said kickflip
help 2018-11-16 06:58:59 It's a box on wheels ...
help 2018-11-16 06:59:16 There's a reason we downvote that stuff, and there's a reason totten keeps on getting nuke with his creations, it's a god damn box on wheels
help 2018-11-16 06:59:24 Er, admittedly that is a bit dictatorial Empire
help 2018-11-16 07:00:21 GAMER, "but i did it" doesn't count, it DIDN'T is the thing

creations-chat 2018-11-16 07:02:15 Ah
help 2018-11-16 07:02:35 Right, let me put the be-all end-all argument for this
help 2018-11-16 07:02:42 There's nothing that defines it as a skateboard, at all
help 2018-11-16 07:03:29 It's not a skateboard, it can't do anything a skateboard can, it doesn't look anything like a skateboard, and it's absolutely abhorrently ugly
help 2018-11-16 07:03:48 Your OWN upvote gamer, which we don't count, and I already booted your alternate account
creations-chat 2018-11-16 07:04:31 Most combat-effective fighter?
creations-chat 2018-11-16 07:05:06 I meant combat-effective
creations-chat 2018-11-16 07:05:14 Like, able to take the most damage, maneuver the fastest, etc
help 2018-11-16 07:05:31 You wanna see what makes a good replicator rank?

help 2018-11-16 07:06:46 THIS
help 2018-11-16 07:06:51 THIS IS WHAT MAKES A GOOD REPLICATOR RANK
help 2018-11-16 07:06:57 Credit to Imperial
help 2018-11-16 07:07:26 OHF- oh yeaaaahhhh, I nearly forgot
help 2018-11-16 07:07:39 Well, congrats geinuous
creations-chat 2018-11-16 07:07:52 It's pretty nice
creations-chat 2018-11-16 07:08:06 I tend to play in third person, hence why my cockpit's solid
help 2018-11-16 07:08:27 ...
help 2018-11-16 07:08:40 It's literally a flying box, even moreso than Totten's, which I thought was literally impossible
creations-chat 2018-11-16 07:09:01 I could refit my fighter to use glass rather than solid blocks
creations-chat 2018-11-16 07:09:11 gamer, my planes float like nobody's business, seriously
creations-chat 2018-11-16 07:09:34 I TRIED sinking the MK2 with it's reverse thrust, that thing just floats right back up
creations-chat 2018-11-16 07:09:58 It's really bulky, and obvious, I like it
help 2018-11-16 07:10:06 Not really
creations-chat 2018-11-16 07:10:55 Gonna resurface my two prized planes, the MK2 fighter and the superfighter
creations-chat 2018-11-16 07:11:00 
creations-chat 2018-11-16 07:11:04 
creations-chat 2018-11-16 07:11:25 It's fine
creations-chat 2018-11-16 07:11:28 Also, what do you think?
creations-chat 2018-11-16 07:11:39 Both, the MK2 and superfighter
creations-chat 2018-11-16 07:12:13 The MK2's for performance, hence lack of paint, I also retrofitted it with rocket engines rather than jet engines
creations-chat 2018-11-16 07:12:32 The superfighter's moreso for looks, but it's got so many pieces that even if you nuke it it'll remain intact
creations-chat 2018-11-16 07:13:00 Bump the wings further forwards?
creations-chat 2018-11-16 07:26:39 Hey, that means you're doing well
creations-chat 2018-11-16 14:11:14 It's him Imperial, if anything it's more legitimate because it's obstructed by a semi-transparent thing, primarily because you'd have to copy the letters from somewhere else if you're going that far to get ranks
creations-chat 2018-11-16 14:12:06 Like, it's obstructed, but if you look closely you can see the name through the effects
creations-chat 2018-11-16 14:46:45 Try making it arena-cappable, aka: Guns and/or missiles
creations-chat 2018-11-16 15:08:24 I mean, (sorry if I'm pushing this one quite a bit, but) the MK2's probably even better at that (except on the top and bottom, there it's a huge target)
creations-chat 2018-11-16 15:08:42 Of course that's the old jets only variant, back when the arena only accepted old blocks
creations-chat 2018-11-16 15:09:18 But still, I literally had the thing take about 80% damage recently and it still flew, infact, it not only flew, it was able to fight back pretty fiercely still
creations-chat 2018-11-16 15:10:57 Tops out at 450 with the new engines, but it's also able to turn 90 degrees within it's length, basically if you took the length of the MK2 and put a plane 1 (maybe 2 for safety's sake) lengths away from it, it'd be able to turn out of the way in time
creations-chat 2018-11-16 15:11:08 And yes it's one of my most favorite builds of all time because it handles like a dream
creations-chat 2018-11-16 17:27:05 If you take everyone's ability to catch the ranks, and mix it all together, you'll get all the ranks
creations-chat 2018-11-16 18:49:09 I wanna make a squadron of varying fighters, seriously
creations-chat 2018-11-16 18:49:20 Yes I know that's a bad idea in actual practice, but still
creations-chat 2018-11-16 18:50:04 If it's durable, able to maneuver quickly and can load alot of firepower while being fast, I guess so fonkl
creations-chat 2018-11-16 18:50:09 Also, hey, we have another Imperial in the server
creations-chat 2018-11-16 18:50:24 Also if I had to guess I'd say that that fighter's about 200-300 parts?
creations-chat 2018-11-16 18:51:23 Hey, I'm pretty good at guessing how many parts there are
creations-chat 2018-11-16 22:41:36 Want critique on it?
creations-chat 2018-11-16 22:42:09 Like, ways that you could improve on future builds later
creations-chat 2018-11-16 22:42:19 It will be a bit, hurtful, fair warning
creations-chat 2018-11-17 00:52:44 With a dive like that, no amount of bracing will save ya
bug-reports 2018-11-17 00:59:09 We know, Rick's fixing that
creations-chat 2018-11-17 01:11:57 It works per click, so autoclicker
creations-chat 2018-11-17 04:52:39 Hey, V-wing deisgn, nice, also do I see motors on the rear wings?
creations-chat 2018-11-17 21:24:11 Ignacioel, ultimate swing-wing fighter
creations-chat 2018-11-17 21:24:40 You know what swing wings are, right?
creations-chat 2018-11-17 21:25:09 https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/05/Three_F-111s_with_different_wing_configurations.jpg
bug-reports 2018-11-17 22:06:23 It's been there, most of us have built around it by this point
creations-chat 2018-11-18 02:48:04 Nice, looks pretty nimble
creations-chat 2018-11-18 21:30:15 Tilts which direction?
creations-chat 2018-11-18 22:52:08 Welp, GG, Santa Sleigh, nice job
bug-reports 2018-11-19 03:07:05 You're trying to make a U-wing aren't you?
bug-reports 2018-11-19 03:07:54 Auto controls are assigned as soon as you spawn in, meaning that you have to build it with the wings folded out in order for it to work, and even then it'll act weirdly
bug-reports 2018-11-19 03:08:07 They don't automatically update as you move your wings
creations-chat 2018-11-19 04:22:36 Pretty decent for a first plane
creations-chat 2018-11-19 04:32:18 Oh god what are you planning Ignacioel?
creations-chat 2018-11-19 04:34:46 Welp, uhhhhhhh
creations-chat 2018-11-19 04:34:48 Huuuhhhh
creations-chat 2018-11-19 04:35:55 That's actually accurate
creations-chat 2018-11-19 04:36:19 WAIT ARE YOU S- Ignacioel, quit trying to make inventor like 90 times over, we only have a finite amount of metal to make our trophies out of
creations-chat 2018-11-19 04:39:20 Now make it drop out of a plane or heli or something
creations-chat 2018-11-19 04:40:27 I'm pretty sure you're so good that every movement you make is inadvertedly flexing on the rest of us
creations-chat 2018-11-19 05:37:58 Nice
creations-chat 2018-11-19 05:40:13 I'm pretty sure they'd be hard-pressed to copy it
creations-chat 2018-11-19 05:40:38 Anything above 100 blocks is probably hard to copy
creations-chat 2018-11-19 05:46:12 Not bad
creations-chat 2018-11-19 05:48:26 PFFFFF, well done, round of applause for you
bug-reports 2018-11-19 06:24:15 Lansink, you can still make the U-wing, you just need the wings to start open then
bug-reports 2018-11-19 06:30:57 It's a keyboard/OS issue
bug-reports 2018-11-19 06:31:25 I believe so
bug-reports 2018-11-19 06:31:35 The most I've used is 4, and that was in the past
creations-chat 2018-11-19 07:01:50 Why so many A-10s!?
creations-chat 2018-11-19 07:01:57 This is like the 90th A-10 I saw
creations-chat 2018-11-19 07:02:36 I'd imagine because it's stupidly reliable
creations-chat 2018-11-19 20:08:22 Propeller blades, not engines
creations-chat 2018-11-19 20:08:47 I meant the 4 propeller engines you're using for a VTOL style movement
help 2018-11-19 20:10:03 Ballasts are your best bet
creations-chat 2018-11-19 20:11:49 Any helium?
creations-chat 2018-11-19 20:12:25 Done, don't break my trust or I'll break you, got it? (FYI I'm in a bad mood, so expect me to be a bit, pissy)
creations-chat 2018-11-19 20:12:31 Show the part count
creations-chat 2018-11-19 20:12:34 Ballasts act as heavier blocks
creations-chat 2018-11-19 20:12:58 Also, quite literally if anything can fly, it's considered for the part ranks
creations-chat 2018-11-19 20:13:10 Done
creations-chat 2018-11-19 20:13:43 Done for van
creations-chat 2018-11-19 20:14:10 You already have master builder
creations-chat 2018-11-19 20:14:13 Next is 2K+
creations-chat 2018-11-19 20:15:38 Done
creations-chat 2018-11-19 20:16:01 Block count?
creations-chat 2018-11-19 20:16:12 RIP prop master Flame, sorry, but that's the rank's rules
creations-chat 2018-11-19 20:16:28 Balance it without helium and you'll get it again
creations-chat 2018-11-19 20:16:47 I mean, it's a start
creations-chat 2018-11-19 20:19:53 Corner wedges merge well with other wedges
creations-chat 2018-11-19 20:26:10 Yeup, that actually reminds me, hmmm
creations-chat 2018-11-19 20:52:35 Want any ranks, or nah?
help 2018-11-19 21:10:42 He's just trying to be obnoxious, I mean look, he has inventor, so he must've gotten it from somewhere
creations-chat 2018-11-19 22:08:48 Show me your build?
creations-chat 2018-11-19 22:09:13 I meant on the whole craft
creations-chat 2018-11-19 22:09:15 Ah
creations-chat 2018-11-19 22:09:19 I see the issue immediately
creations-chat 2018-11-19 22:09:26 Too much lift in the rear, not enough in the front
creations-chat 2018-11-19 22:09:30 Also, A-wing?
creations-chat 2018-11-19 22:09:46 Yeah, sadly Plane Crazy's physics detest fighters like that
creations-chat 2018-11-19 22:09:55 Also, save and reload the creation, you'll get the center of lift back
creations-chat 2018-11-19 22:09:59 You'll find it's WAY in the rear
creations-chat 2018-11-19 22:11:17 Aerodynamics work as if they're isolated from everything else, AKA: They work no matter what
creations-chat 2018-11-19 22:11:21 Aso that looks pretty good Supreme
creations-chat 2018-11-19 22:11:30 And how the heck is that a spitfire radoor?
creations-chat 2018-11-19 22:12:13 Ignore Dragon, he's been mad ever since we've shot a terrible idea of his down
creations-chat 2018-11-19 22:12:55 Sadly that can't happen, again, hard coded, the game was never meant to be updated
creations-chat 2018-11-19 22:15:30 Position and number of wing panels matter
creations-chat 2018-11-19 22:16:05 Best suggestion: Try it out
creations-chat 2018-11-19 22:16:18 Remember, a center of lift in your rear will make you nosedive alot
creations-chat 2018-11-19 22:16:29 So you want to try to get your center of lift near the actual center
creations-chat 2018-11-19 22:16:33 If it's not appearing, save and try rejoining
creations-chat 2018-11-19 22:16:49 Is, that a freaking mech?
creations-chat 2018-11-19 22:17:03 ._. Well then Kavteh
creations-chat 2018-11-19 22:17:18 Also that's not really a spitfire, it's more like your own design
creations-chat 2018-11-19 22:17:49 Ballasts are slightly broken, you have to eyeball it
creations-chat 2018-11-19 22:18:06 Nice job
creations-chat 2018-11-19 22:18:18 Also, I'd suggest using super rockets rather than regular rockets, super rockets are stronger and smaller
creations-chat 2018-11-19 22:18:34 The main pro is aesthetics, which, let's be honest, that looks WAY more awesome, right?
creations-chat 2018-11-19 22:19:30 Dragon, does it seem like I care about what you type out? You hate upon everything except your own creations and what Totten makes
creations-chat 2018-11-19 22:21:11 Yeup
bug-reports 2018-11-19 22:28:59 If you need a break rick, feel free to take one
bug-reports 2018-11-19 22:31:30 Rick's going to fix it soon, just hold on for a bit
help 2018-11-19 22:34:50 Camera blocks act like another first person viewpoint
help 2018-11-19 22:35:04 It's fine
creations-chat 2018-11-19 22:57:59 Nice one
creations-chat 2018-11-20 00:45:29 AHEM
creations-chat 2018-11-20 00:46:21 Sooner or later I'm going to have to start handing out warnings like unwanted candy to little craps that can't control themselves ... Don't think I can't see what you typed, remember Rule 2
creations-chat 2018-11-20 00:46:29 I'll let you off for now, but do it again and see what happens
help 2018-11-20 03:27:30 Did you check the controls?
help 2018-11-20 03:27:39 Manual or automatic?
help 2018-11-20 03:27:58 Does it have an inverse effect, or do they just not work?
help 2018-11-20 03:28:39 Odd, try saving and reloading the craft
help 2018-11-20 03:29:58 Remove a couple and re-add them, see if they have an effect afterwards
creations-chat 2018-11-20 03:30:23 What do you mean? Like, how to make such a large creation in such a small space?
creations-chat 2018-11-20 03:30:35 Also, Duuck, if you want to get a rank, you need to show the save slot
creations-chat 2018-11-20 03:30:43 And Wyse, that's thanks to folding, in <#501034677793193994>
creations-chat 2018-11-20 03:30:59 For a summary of it, it's the art of making specific points where motors can bring the craft together
creations-chat 2018-11-20 12:42:51 I think I saw someone make a swashplate before, although those are extremely rare, let me check
creations-chat 2018-11-20 12:43:02 mxdanger made one
creations-chat 2018-11-20 12:43:09 Search up "swashplate" and you'll see
creations-chat 2018-11-20 14:02:35 Nice one
creations-chat 2018-11-20 14:56:13 Is that a challenge Furno?
creations-chat 2018-11-20 14:57:07 Then don't claim "most manoeverable", because that tends to send out a challenge to those to build a more maneuverable craft
creations-chat 2018-11-20 14:57:37 Ah
creations-chat 2018-11-20 14:57:51 Nevermind, I'm blind, I blame lack of sleep
creations-chat 2018-11-20 17:27:38 Nice
creations-chat 2018-11-20 17:30:36 Whatever you want
creations-chat 2018-11-21 01:55:14 Sounds like a weight/thrust imbalance, check your center of lift and any motors/engines
help 2018-11-21 01:56:36 Thrust's even and such as well?
help 2018-11-21 01:56:56 You might have a slight wing deficiency, wings cause a stunning amount of drag
help 2018-11-21 01:57:02 And if you look at the center of lift, it's slightly off
help 2018-11-21 01:57:05 So double check your wings
help 2018-11-21 01:57:12 If they're not off, that means you have extra mass somewhere
help 2018-11-21 01:57:21 So you need to double check your block placement, including internals
help 2018-11-21 01:57:29 If neither are true, then I have no idea what's wrong
creations-chat 2018-11-21 02:50:59 Looks pretty freaking nice
creations-chat 2018-11-21 02:51:31 I'm not sarcastic
creations-chat 2018-11-21 02:58:05 Try posting a picture of the save slot if you would
bug-reports 2018-11-21 03:38:09 You can still hit yourself in the PVP mode
creations-chat 2018-11-21 04:08:29 Nice
creations-chat 2018-11-21 04:59:17 1: What color should I paint this
2: Did I make the belly too fat?
creations-chat 2018-11-21 04:59:44 I'm trying to revamp the MK2 into a MK3
creations-chat 2018-11-21 05:00:16 The goals would be a stronger central spine, engine protection of some sort and redesigned wings
creations-chat 2018-11-21 05:00:27 So, did I make the belly of the craft too fat, or?
creations-chat 2018-11-21 05:01:50 The belly protects some underside boosters
creations-chat 2018-11-21 05:01:59 OH F- same picture, whops
creations-chat 2018-11-21 05:02:09 
creations-chat 2018-11-21 05:02:41 
creations-chat 2018-11-21 05:10:00 Added more armoring on the fusilage, topside this time
creations-chat 2018-11-21 05:10:52 Any opinions?
creations-chat 2018-11-21 05:14:03 General cockpit area's painted black, any ideas on what I should do for a color scheme?
creations-chat 2018-11-21 05:14:32 I can recolor the general cockpit area you know
creations-chat 2018-11-21 05:14:42 I just painted it black to make that area obvious
creations-chat 2018-11-21 05:16:35 Alright
creations-chat 2018-11-21 05:17:31 So, the main fuselage would be blue, similar to my superfighter
creations-chat 2018-11-21 05:17:46 Wings I want something on them though
creations-chat 2018-11-21 05:27:35 The MK3 fighter, an enhancement over the MK2 in durability and maneuverability, with modified wings in order to provide a more stable flight
creations-chat 2018-11-21 05:27:50 Might recolor the cockpit though
creations-chat 2018-11-21 05:29:45 I literally used 110 blue
creations-chat 2018-11-21 05:30:08 Also, from now on, 110 blue and 150 red are my corporation's primary colors
creations-chat 2018-11-21 05:30:16 And Fea_rr, you're not limited to square, use wedges
creations-chat 2018-11-21 05:31:19 The only thing this thing needs is more weaponry
creations-chat 2018-11-21 05:32:34 If rockets were homing, it could mount 8 forward facing ones and 2 rear facing ones without compromising look
creations-chat 2018-11-21 05:36:03 Go for it
creations-chat 2018-11-21 05:37:47 I will give you one hint: Around the 200-400 mark's what I landed on
creations-chat 2018-11-21 05:38:23 For sake of an actual challenge, it's primary thrust has to be forwards
creations-chat 2018-11-21 05:40:02 I find that anything smaller than 200 can get crippled easily, anything larger than 400's an easy target
creations-chat 2018-11-21 05:40:29 Hell, the original MK 2 was only 267 parts, and if you didn't notice, it had a very thin spinal area
creations-chat 2018-11-21 05:41:13 You want your profile to be small as well, with the MK3, it's profile's wider in some areas, but it's still really narrow compared to other fighters
creations-chat 2018-11-21 05:42:14 It's fine if one target profile's really wide, in my case, the top and bottom, but you need to make the others really thin, in my case, the side and especially the front
creations-chat 2018-11-21 05:42:52 Observe
creations-chat 2018-11-21 05:43:46 For comparison, here's the top profile
creations-chat 2018-11-21 05:44:20 Freaking huge in comparison, an easy target, but the thing is that it's pitch is so great that it can turn to face it's targets
creations-chat 2018-11-21 06:20:55 Done
help 2018-11-21 06:25:34 A fighter in Plane Crazy is literally any plane that has adept or better combat capabilities
help 2018-11-21 06:25:50 So no 20 block planes, we're talking ones that can fly fast, maneuver on a dime, take a hit, and deliver a serious punch
help 2018-11-21 06:26:10 If you build one well, it'll fall under all those categories on it's own
help 2018-11-21 06:28:05 My original MK 2 fighter was quoted to be like a eurofighter
help 2018-11-21 06:28:27 Only thing it couldn't do was take a hit, specifically on the spinal section of the craft, considering there's only the structure blocks there
help 2018-11-21 06:28:51 The MK 3 solves this by adding a layer of armor along the spine, and re-structuring the wings for a more stable flight
help 2018-11-21 06:29:03 It also updated it's engines to use super rockets instead of jet engines
help 2018-11-21 06:31:06 Yeah, that's the basics of a fighter, now go make one of your own!
creations-chat 2018-11-21 06:47:00 Oh holy crap, it's like you had a giant chunk of stone, then started carving out a statue
creations-chat 2018-11-21 06:47:03 Niiice!
creations-chat 2018-11-21 06:49:02 Uhhh, okaaayyyy then? What, exactly do you want with it gage?
creations-chat 2018-11-21 06:50:26 Ehhhh, alright, it's not really showoff-worthy though to be fully honest
creations-chat 2018-11-21 06:50:44 People are impressed by huge, complex, beautiful and/or generally amazing creations
creations-chat 2018-11-21 06:51:14 Or really cool design processes like Ogami's, he's almost literally chiseling out his wing craft from a bunch of blocks
creations-chat 2018-11-21 06:51:26 Uhhh, what?
creations-chat 2018-11-21 06:51:52 Oh, OOOHHHHH, nice one actually
creations-chat 2018-11-21 06:52:09 Sorry, just, sorta unfamiliar with Robot Wars/Robot Arena/Battlebots
creations-chat 2018-11-21 06:52:20 I love the concept, and I want a game based off of it, but I'm unfamiliar with them
creations-chat 2018-11-21 06:52:46 Yeah, build your own robot to duke it out with other robots
creations-chat 2018-11-21 06:53:23 Robot Arena 2, best Robot fighting game
creations-chat 2018-11-21 06:53:36 AA system with a very solid base?
creations-chat 2018-11-21 06:54:32 Honestly, RA3 is abandonware we don't really talk about
creations-chat 2018-11-21 06:57:15 Okay okay hold on a bit
creations-chat 2018-11-21 06:57:32 Builder ranks are doubled on land
creations-chat 2018-11-21 06:57:41 Yeup
creations-chat 2018-11-21 06:57:55 Alright
creations-chat 2018-11-21 07:00:24 Second one, alot smoother
creations-chat 2018-11-21 07:02:39 Basically a cramped version of a huge rocket, except with a bit more strength
creations-chat 2018-11-21 07:02:48 Yeah
creations-chat 2018-11-21 07:03:05 Make it controllable in the air for it to count, alright?
creations-chat 2018-11-21 07:18:17 Folders existed for a while, and I mean ever since motors existed
creations-chat 2018-11-21 07:18:24 And I believe that associates paint as well
creations-chat 2018-11-21 07:18:36 So, sorry Duck, but no, no inventor
creations-chat 2018-11-21 07:18:44 New mechanisms, not iterations on existing ones
bug-reports 2018-11-21 07:22:31 Probably because they're complex pieces
creations-chat 2018-11-21 07:22:37 Either novel or useful
creations-chat 2018-11-21 07:23:47 You can't sadly
bug-reports 2018-11-21 07:24:07 Oy, don't cheese it or so help me I'm shoving a block of cheese on your head

creations-chat 2018-11-21 07:24:55 The first one's novel, a truck that transforms into a crab machine
creations-chat 2018-11-21 07:25:04 The second one's useful, a modular building system for vehicles
creations-chat 2018-11-21 07:25:13 Both obviously already done
creations-chat 2018-11-21 07:25:45 They both qualify for inventor by the way, infact, we're running out of inventor trophies for him
creations-chat 2018-11-21 07:27:02 Nope, modeler maybe, but a washing machine has already been done
creations-chat 2018-11-21 07:27:11 So you're too late for that
creations-chat 2018-11-21 07:27:25 You're gonna have some backflipping issues Ogami, but good luck
creations-chat 2018-11-21 07:27:48 Transforming vehicles? Yeaahhh, blame Ignacioel again
creations-chat 2018-11-21 07:28:00 Again blame Ignacioel, he sniped like 50% of Inventor-worthy things
creations-chat 2018-11-21 07:28:47 How about build a train that can lay down it's own tracks
creations-chat 2018-11-21 07:28:54 It picks up the ones behind it's self and lays them down infront
creations-chat 2018-11-21 07:28:57 THAT will get you inventor
creations-chat 2018-11-21 07:29:46 Modeler boymahina, not invenetor
creations-chat 2018-11-21 07:31:42 Frog jumping's already done
creations-chat 2018-11-21 18:05:16 No Man's Sky?
creations-chat 2018-11-21 18:06:53 Hey, it looks pretty nice honestly
creations-chat 2018-11-21 19:56:11 I was afk for a while, and which piece?
creations-chat 2018-11-21 19:56:33 Alright, the fuselage is the least noteworthy part to be honest
creations-chat 2018-11-21 20:23:57 That's the agility you need in order to maintain combat effectiveness
creations-chat 2018-11-21 20:24:01 You aim via practice
creations-chat 2018-11-21 20:24:13 Sorta
creations-chat 2018-11-21 20:24:22 Well, not for rockets
creations-chat 2018-11-21 20:24:26 Those are near useless to be honest
creations-chat 2018-11-21 20:24:34 Actually, I only use keys to fly that thing
creations-chat 2018-11-21 20:25:10 Community server?
creations-chat 2018-11-21 20:25:54 Happens alot
creations-chat 2018-11-21 20:28:28 I'm in A PVP server, but I'm not sure I'm in yours
creations-chat 2018-11-22 00:15:06 Ahbupupup, no Grab, no further, got it?
creations-chat 2018-11-22 00:17:10 AHEM
creations-chat 2018-11-22 00:17:32 Clean it up, now ...
creations-chat 2018-11-22 00:17:57 Meaning BOTH OF YOU <@!340543153922768906> <@456226577798135808>
creations-chat 2018-11-22 00:18:16 Rule 2's the easiest to enforce because it's got the least grey space, and you're in that space now
creations-chat 2018-11-22 00:18:22 Yeah trollgein?
creations-chat 2018-11-22 00:25:55 AAHHHEEEEMMMMMM
creations-chat 2018-11-22 00:26:09 You forgot, it gets submitted to <#384025409945337856>
creations-chat 2018-11-22 00:26:26 You are in serious, serious shit, both of you
creations-chat 2018-11-22 00:27:08 Mhm, you said this wouldn't happen the first time after entering the server, and then THIS happens
creations-chat 2018-11-22 00:28:15 Now both of you shape up, GOT IT!?
creations-chat 2018-11-22 00:28:34 https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/504436696021204992/514956105210789899/unknown.png
creations-chat 2018-11-22 00:28:34 He painted this skin colored after Grab egged him on to do so
creations-chat 2018-11-22 00:29:38 If you want a good STOL, you need great lift
creations-chat 2018-11-22 00:30:02 That's because you have alot of lift near the front
creations-chat 2018-11-22 00:30:10 If it goes up too easily, pull the center of lift back, but add more wings
creations-chat 2018-11-22 00:30:23 If it's too difficult, push it forward with more wings
creations-chat 2018-11-22 00:30:57 For a creation of that size, you want them almost, if not merged into eachother to a certain degree
creations-chat 2018-11-22 00:31:06 Amazing example of an STOL
creations-chat 2018-11-22 00:31:25 And I say this not to toot my own horn, but because this thing floats down like it's got all the parachutes attached
creations-chat 2018-11-22 00:32:06 You have a huge wing to fuselage ratio then
creations-chat 2018-11-22 00:32:19 It's called the magnet drive
creations-chat 2018-11-22 00:32:26 Aka: Warp drive
creations-chat 2018-11-22 00:33:02 Let's see then
creations-chat 2018-11-22 00:34:24 I meant Lumber, I think you're fine that
creations-chat 2018-11-22 00:37:36 No thanks
creations-chat 2018-11-22 00:48:57 What?
creations-chat 2018-11-22 00:49:15 ... What?
creations-chat 2018-11-22 00:49:32 It's already gone
creations-chat 2018-11-22 00:49:36 Also, huh trollgeinu
creations-chat 2018-11-22 00:50:23 Jesus christ, dude, calm down
creations-chat 2018-11-22 00:56:52 Uhhhh, huuuuhhhhh
creations-chat 2018-11-22 04:56:00 Damn Lansink! Nice one
creations-chat 2018-11-22 04:56:52 Xero, what's the issue with it? Or does it actually work?
creations-chat 2018-11-22 04:57:38 Plumits how so? Nosedives, or?
creations-chat 2018-11-22 04:58:18 Ah, center of lift too far forwards, thrust too far down
creations-chat 2018-11-22 04:58:59 Think of applying a force to a see-saw
creations-chat 2018-11-22 04:59:40 Ignore every other force and cut it down the middle, then think of how applying the force would work
creations-chat 2018-11-22 05:01:07 It'll make it worse
creations-chat 2018-11-22 05:01:16 If you pull back too fast, it'll make it worse
creations-chat 2018-11-22 05:01:26 Instead add thrust up-top and drag the center of lift slightly further back
creations-chat 2018-11-22 05:02:05 This is a very, VERY stable creation, take a guess why
creations-chat 2018-11-22 05:02:46 The center of lift is blue, center of mass is yellow
creations-chat 2018-11-22 05:03:32 Actually, that's false Xero
creations-chat 2018-11-22 05:03:46 I'll give you a hint, this is an older version, with jets instead of rockets
creations-chat 2018-11-22 05:04:22 Er, not quite
creations-chat 2018-11-22 05:04:29 The reason it's so stable is because there's jets on the underside
creations-chat 2018-11-22 05:04:35 These jets cause it to rotate upwards slightly
creations-chat 2018-11-22 05:04:44 Which is countered by the downwards rotation due to the center of lift
creations-chat 2018-11-22 05:05:14 Yes, the center of lift is in the back, which causes this craft to pitch downwards at low thrust, but at high thrust, the thrusters on the underbelly counteract this downwards pitch
creations-chat 2018-11-22 05:05:42 You probably have too much underbelly thrust and too much upwards pitch Xero
creations-chat 2018-11-22 05:06:07 Either drag the center of lift farther back by adding more wings in the back, or add thrusters on the top, so as they activate, they cause it to pitch downwards
help 2018-11-22 05:08:04 Is it just slamming it's nose into the ground?
help 2018-11-22 05:09:08 No lift?
creations-chat 2018-11-22 05:09:21 It just clicked for me one day
help 2018-11-22 05:09:52 Yeup, center of lift's WAY too far back
help 2018-11-22 05:09:59 Slam it forwards
help 2018-11-22 05:10:34 Bump that mega delta wing forwards, or do what I did
help 2018-11-22 05:10:41 And put wings on the front
help 2018-11-22 05:10:53 By the way, no copying my design! Iterate your own features onto it
help 2018-11-22 05:11:55 You need to modify the design kiwi
help 2018-11-22 05:12:24 More weight in the back, more lift in the front, and possibly more thrust on the underbelly
creations-chat 2018-11-22 05:12:36 It pulls up too fast, doing backflips from what I'm judging
creations-chat 2018-11-22 05:13:37 I believe so
creations-chat 2018-11-22 05:18:02 The issue is is that from experience, it's not forward enough to really cause uncontrollable backflips
creations-chat 2018-11-22 19:37:37 Looks like the First Order variant
creations-chat 2018-11-22 19:38:09 First Order TIEs are far, FAR more durable
creations-chat 2018-11-22 19:38:36 True, but one took a literal missile and didn't get blown into atoms
help 2018-11-23 03:02:37 I don't think that'll affect it
help 2018-11-23 03:02:43 Check your engines
help 2018-11-23 03:02:52 If not, check your center of lift and center of mass
help 2018-11-23 03:03:03 Trust me, it doesn't, the center of mass doesn't shift like that
help 2018-11-23 03:03:13 If it did, it'd be alot easier to shift the center of lift and/or center of mass like that
help 2018-11-23 03:03:35 But as it stands, it was a bitch to get this creation working, even placing stuff on the floor
help 2018-11-23 03:03:41 So no, placing stuff on the floor won't affect it
help 2018-11-23 03:03:49 Yes it will make inaccurate readings, but the actual readings will still be there
creations-chat 2018-11-23 22:43:11 It looks nice to be honest
creations-chat 2018-11-23 22:44:12 Try using wedges?
creations-chat 2018-11-23 23:03:41 Got shredded a bit Fea_rr?
creations-chat 2018-11-24 02:00:49 The arresting wire and catapult launcher are part of the carrier, not the fighter

creations-chat 2018-11-24 02:13:31 Like, without any inputs and helium
creations-chat 2018-11-24 02:14:03 Ah

help 2018-11-24 18:56:25 Pitch, yaw, or roll?
help 2018-11-24 18:57:29 Pitch, dedicate the interior control surfaces to up and down, 
Roll, dedicate the outer-most control surfaces to tilt in an alternating pattern
Yaw, get a better tail with more control surfaces on it
With pure control surfaces, your turning increases the faster you go
creations-chat 2018-11-24 21:38:43 Can you tone down the swearing? It's a bit excessive here

creations-chat 2018-11-25 04:56:58 That's easy u_wus
creations-chat 2018-11-25 04:57:41 Try removing the wings, adding rotational thrusters and spawning in the water, see what happens
creations-chat 2018-11-25 04:57:45 And, maybe more forwards thrust
creations-chat 2018-11-25 04:58:46 Yeah, but if you convert it into a sub, it's able to more easily move in the water
creations-chat 2018-11-25 04:59:00 This thing's EXCEPTIONAL at moving in the water, guess why
creations-chat 2018-11-25 05:00:34 Plenty of it's maneuverability comes from it's thrusters
creations-chat 2018-11-25 05:00:45 So it's able to turn extremely quickly at extremely low speeds
creations-chat 2018-11-25 05:29:40 Looks like it's in a dance show and someone's shining a spotlight on it

bug-reports 2018-11-25 19:47:14 Ooohhh, they act like whole blocks huh?
bug-reports 2018-11-25 19:47:35 Riiight, that's definitely a bug
help 2018-11-25 19:48:17 We classify VTOLs as vehicles that are capable of taking off and landing entirely vertically, with primarily forwards thrust
creations-chat 2018-11-25 19:55:31 Nice
creations-chat 2018-11-25 19:56:13 Done
creations-chat 2018-11-25 20:16:58 Nice, what's the block count? (I'm estimating around the 150 range, maybe 200?)
creations-chat 2018-11-25 20:17:56 Ah, alright
creations-chat 2018-11-25 20:25:45 Looks a bit, merged together, try making it pop out a bit more?
creations-chat 2018-11-25 20:27:42 Not bad
creations-chat 2018-11-25 20:31:08 Welp, nice
creations-chat 2018-11-25 20:33:22 Impressive G4M3
creations-chat 2018-11-25 20:41:23 You want it to move like a turret, correct?
creations-chat 2018-11-25 20:41:51 You got the correct idea with the motors
creations-chat 2018-11-25 20:42:01 All I can say is give it more room
bug-reports 2018-11-25 20:52:03 Save and reload your creation, it gets rid of those ghost blocks
help 2018-11-25 21:10:43 Older server?
creations-chat 2018-11-25 21:20:06 British aircraft?
creations-chat 2018-11-25 21:20:26 Nice
creations-chat 2018-11-25 21:26:57 You already have it Supreme
creations-chat 2018-11-25 21:29:34 Go for it G4M3
creations-chat 2018-11-25 21:54:47 A bit tiny, but it's pretty nice
creations-chat 2018-11-25 21:55:20 Ah, nice
creations-chat 2018-11-25 21:56:15 If you want
bug-reports 2018-11-25 22:10:42 Probably because the chat's being spammed up
help 2018-11-25 22:16:36 Just make a vehicle that can submerge
help 2018-11-25 22:20:11 Sadly no, also, T3rr, think how to move in the air, except in the water
creations-chat 2018-11-26 01:20:25 To be honest I've grown kinda numb to your over the top and absurd (in the best of ways) creations Ignacioel
creations-chat 2018-11-26 03:28:04 Ehhhhh, what's it's main deal?
bug-reports 2018-11-26 14:14:41 While going fast or going slow?
creations-chat 2018-11-26 21:47:57 WELL THEN (This thing can still fly by the way)
bug-reports 2018-11-26 22:29:34 Oh hey, also, nobody said they were heat seeking
bug-reports 2018-11-26 22:30:08 I will be honest, I do want some form of heat seeking missile though
bug-reports 2018-11-26 22:30:45 They USED to be heat seeking at one point in the test server, however, I sorta showed that that either worked TOO well, or it didn't work at all
bug-reports 2018-11-26 22:31:19 Nah, Super, back in the test server, if you were below a certain speed, you got murdered by them, if you were above a certain speed however, they were as good as useless against you
bug-reports 2018-11-26 22:32:14 The speed in the test server was about 200 straight, 225 if you want to do very broad turns, 250 for comfortable turns
bug-reports 2018-11-26 22:32:29 Anything above that and they wouldn't hit you, even if you tried to get hit by them
bug-reports 2018-11-26 22:32:43 And trust me, I flew straight at a guy once, the missiles didn't hit
bug-reports 2018-11-26 22:33:23 Super, again, it doesn't matter if you have the entire map as it's range, if you're fast enough, missiles can't catch up
bug-reports 2018-11-26 22:33:46 Plus with their kind of turning circle, very maneuverable fighters can outmaneuver them easily
bug-reports 2018-11-26 22:36:00 If they're any faster with a larger range, they'll just peg you no matter what, if they're at the same speed, they won't be able to catch up, and even then, there's not really a good indicator that one's after you until you're hit by it
creations-chat 2018-11-26 22:43:03 We'll probably make another fantasy based replicator rank if that's the case
help 2018-11-26 22:50:30 Bigger tends to be more stable
help 2018-11-26 22:52:14 Center of lift's too far in the back, bump it forwards
help 2018-11-26 22:52:42 Or tweak the wing sizes, or make the rear heavier somehow

help 2018-11-27 04:02:52 You can stretch it to infinity, and squish it to an atom, it will try to spring back to it's original shape however
help 2018-11-27 04:03:03 Dampening is how much the shock in the spring gets absorbed
help 2018-11-27 04:03:10 Think of 0 dampening like an infinite slinky
help 2018-11-27 04:03:21 Free length is how far it stretches naturally
help 2018-11-27 04:03:30 And stiffness is obviously stiffness
creations-chat 2018-11-27 04:21:21 Try using day time?
creations-chat 2018-11-27 04:21:27 It's a bit hard to see details
creations-chat 2018-11-27 04:21:37 Although to be honest it looks like a pretty nice bruiser of a craft
creations-chat 2018-11-27 04:22:12 It's pretty good to be honest
creations-chat 2018-11-27 04:22:22 Center of lift too far forwards?
creations-chat 2018-11-27 04:22:29 Engines too far under the center of mass?
creations-chat 2018-11-27 04:23:37 The Center of Lift being too far forwards can cause the nose to lift up
creations-chat 2018-11-27 04:36:41 Holy crap, nice
creations-chat 2018-11-27 04:38:10 An ejectable mechanism that gently pushes it backwards?
creations-chat 2018-11-27 04:39:18 Ah, that works out to
creations-chat 2018-11-27 04:41:43 You saved in 12-13?
creations-chat 2018-11-27 04:41:58 Wait what?
creations-chat 2018-11-27 04:42:08 Huh
creations-chat 2018-11-27 04:43:34 RIP

creations-chat 2018-11-27 06:46:31 Just don't spam links
creations-chat 2018-11-27 18:15:52 Function over fashion after all?
creations-chat 2018-11-27 18:17:47 Like what's his vehicle's dimensions or what are dimensions?
creations-chat 2018-11-27 18:20:26 People have made rigs before believe it or not
creations-chat 2018-11-27 18:20:35 Infact, I actually made a rig around my fighter once
creations-chat 2018-11-27 18:20:38 Oh
creations-chat 2018-11-27 18:20:43 Wait, oil rig style rig?
creations-chat 2018-11-27 18:21:26 Ah, finish it up and make it look unique and you'll probably get modeler
creations-chat 2018-11-27 18:21:55 Ack, can barely see anything
creations-chat 2018-11-27 18:22:38 Well, nobody made an oil rig, so
creations-chat 2018-11-27 18:23:47 Hey C4RAB, guess what?
creations-chat 2018-11-27 18:24:13 Yeup, look at your ranks
creations-chat 2018-11-27 18:24:21 He already HAD inventor

creations-chat 2018-11-27 18:25:02 Ah
bug-reports 2018-11-27 19:02:33 Toggle it again
creations-chat 2018-11-27 19:05:53 Someone made a U-wing
creations-chat 2018-11-27 19:06:29 U-wing transport
creations-chat 2018-11-27 19:06:30 https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/starwars/images/e/e3/U-wing-SW_Battlefront.png/revision/latest?cb=20170825000742

creations-chat 2018-11-27 19:09:10 Yeah, someone made it, issue is the swinging wings
bug-reports 2018-11-28 03:31:11 You can make a temporary fix by making a sort of stopper system via pistons or motors, it'll let you jam the two back into a relatively equal alignment
bug-reports 2018-11-28 03:36:18 A good example of this is the Russian T-34 during WW2, they literally had pins that held the tracks that weren't held in place, however, they had a sloped piece of metal, which the pins grinded up against and got shoved back in, so they didn't just shake out
creations-chat 2018-11-29 04:00:33 Swashplates were already invented by someone, so
creations-chat 2018-11-29 04:00:52 Yes that has been made before as well
creations-chat 2018-11-29 04:01:35 Flying wings are already done
creations-chat 2018-11-29 04:01:56 Still been done
creations-chat 2018-11-29 04:02:15 That's been done Sak, and even then, unless the hand can pick up stuff dynamically, it'd only count as modeler
creations-chat 2018-11-29 04:46:20 What's the new things?
creations-chat 2018-11-29 04:46:54 Saw that before, people used it to make parachutes
creations-chat 2018-11-29 04:47:10 I believe they have Sakura
creations-chat 2018-11-29 04:47:38 ... No offense, but you didn't even put the landing gear correctly, so I'm starting to doubt they're actually inventor-worthy creation
creations-chat 2018-11-29 04:48:52 ... Already been done, let's see, already been done
creations-chat 2018-11-29 04:50:41 Wedges are lighter than blocks
creations-chat 2018-11-29 04:51:57 Show a video with comparison
creations-chat 2018-11-29 04:53:16 Use the Roblox video maker and crank it through a video to gif thing
creations-chat 2018-11-30 06:47:56 That looks pretty incredible, most notably due to the little ring aperture in the rear, how well does it fly?
creations-chat 2018-11-30 06:49:16 Need a fighter escort for it?
creations-chat 2018-11-30 06:49:49 These "little" (nearing 400 blocks) fighters are, in my opinion, the best of the best
creations-chat 2018-11-30 06:49:59 At least in the current meta of the game
creations-chat 2018-11-30 06:52:50 Thanks, for reference on how much damage it can take:
creations-chat 2018-11-30 06:52:59 THIS THING IS STILL COMBAT CAPABLE BY THE WAY
creations-chat 2018-11-30 06:53:14 Like, it could still hold it's own, very, very aggressively in a dogfight
creations-chat 2018-11-30 06:54:44 Oy, if you want proof, I can rip one of the wings off and fight ya in arena
creations-chat 2018-11-30 06:55:54 Also yes I am very proud of it
the-dump 2018-11-30 07:08:27 Uhhh, ahem, just, report it to one of the mods and we'll direct it to the others
the-dump 2018-11-30 07:08:54 In the mean time though, uhhh, could you please erase that, even though it's not you, it's a bit, sketchy
the-dump 2018-11-30 07:09:06 Thanks
creations-chat 2018-11-30 08:11:07 Believe it or not that's actually only useful if your opponent's better at higher speeds than you (Which actually has happened a couple of times on pure control surface crafts), for most crafts, it's better to do regular dogfighting style, only occasionally toggling the reverse thrust (and decelerator) in order to maneuver better
creations-chat 2018-11-30 08:12:36 Dogfighting at high maneuverability with keybinds is hell, even with mouse it's difficult without a free camera, but when you can control the turning rate, it becomes far, far easier
creations-chat 2018-11-30 08:14:24 If it's an engineered super craft and you're fighting a boeing, it'll probably be one sided
creations-chat 2018-11-30 08:14:33 Also, blocks have health now, and dear freaking god they're beefy as hell
creations-chat 2018-11-30 08:14:50 Each block takes a certain amount of damage
creations-chat 2018-11-30 08:14:53 Similar to the old system
creations-chat 2018-11-30 08:15:36 Ehhhhh, I don't think it's a good idea to limit ammo
creations-chat 2018-11-30 08:15:58 I mean, sorta good, but ehhh
creations-chat 2018-11-30 08:16:34 What I'd suggest is ammo storage, usage, and production within the craft, two new blocks for storage and production, the guns can have tweaked usage
creations-chat 2018-11-30 08:17:18 If you're gonna counter with "But then AA vehicles would pop up and wreck everything", that's what missiles are for, at least, if they're homing
creations-chat 2018-11-30 08:17:31 Erhm, Empire, look in <#384025409945337856>
creations-chat 2018-11-30 08:18:01 Yeah, I am NOT deleting anything no matter what, incase, well
creations-chat 2018-11-30 08:18:06 I'm not gonna say it, but ask around
creations-chat 2018-11-30 08:18:31 But yeah, ammo production, storage, and tweaking gun ammo usage (Possibly missile ammo usage to)
creations-chat 2018-11-30 08:23:05 I feel like I could stuff some SERIOUSLY huge guns and missiles on my fighter
creations-chat 2018-11-30 08:23:17 Because as it stands, it's so floaty, everyone calls it a VTOL, but it's not a VTOL
creations-chat 2018-12-01 00:37:13 Nice fighter
creations-chat 2018-12-01 00:39:53 Alright, cleared out the image by the way
creations-chat 2018-12-01 00:49:52 Not half bad
creations-chat 2018-12-01 00:50:24 I'm pretty sure you don't need me to say it NewDude, but if you really insist, it's really impressive
creations-chat 2018-12-01 00:50:45 I'd suggest making the small turrets rockets though, and making simple CIWS contraptions instead for the guns
creations-chat 2018-12-01 00:50:50 Or at least one CIWS
creations-chat 2018-12-01 00:51:28 Dunno, but if you do it I'll be thoroughly impressed
bug-reports 2018-12-01 00:52:50 They can, but it'll occupy alot of their space
bug-reports 2018-12-01 00:54:06 Probably RGB color saving
bug-reports 2018-12-01 01:01:03 Go to <#491710474786832394> for that stuff, and no, it's hard-coded, meaning it can't be changed
bug-reports 2018-12-01 01:01:32 It was never meant to be changed, ever
bug-reports 2018-12-01 01:01:47 The fact that Rick did what he did already was amazing
bug-reports 2018-12-01 01:02:14 It was a fun little side project of Mad's that was never supposed to become what it is today, but here we are after a ton of rick's magic and wizardry
bug-reports 2018-12-01 01:04:15 Data limit's hard coded, not on our side either
bug-reports 2018-12-01 01:04:19 Roblox's limit
bug-reports 2018-12-01 01:05:59 The limit's sometimes inaccurate
bug-reports 2018-12-01 01:06:28 Give yourself a berth of around 5K blocks, go safe with 4K if you're using very complex creations
bug-reports 2018-12-01 01:08:21 I know it's the incorrect spot Rick, but if I may ask, when's the gimballing parts coming out? It's literally the final step for my last project for a while
creations-chat 2018-12-01 01:08:38 It does, and it's pretty nice
bug-reports 2018-12-01 01:08:47 Even a rough estimate would help
bug-reports 2018-12-01 01:10:29 Sorta like how the F-35's engine can rotate, except in this case, it's within a certain cone style angle
bug-reports 2018-12-01 01:11:03 I say gimballing rather than vectorization because I realized if that kind of block is added, it could be applied for various parts as well
creations-chat 2018-12-01 01:12:26 Alright then, to the VIP server?
creations-chat 2018-12-01 01:12:44 We're going Empire's
creations-chat 2018-12-01 01:17:04 Or, nevermind, I'll try to find you in the PVP servers Linh
bug-reports 2018-12-01 01:17:57 I mean like a dual axis engine, not just a single axis one
bug-reports 2018-12-01 01:18:06 Because to get what I'm going for, I'd need 2 motors
bug-reports 2018-12-01 01:19:30 Also, whoah my MK3 wobbles alot more
bug-reports 2018-12-01 01:28:50 Right, genuine bug, my fighter wobbles alot more than it did before, practically swinging around a full 180 degree hemisphere if I try using both pitch and yaw to turn
bug-reports 2018-12-01 01:36:39 My fighter? The landing gear
bug-reports 2018-12-01 01:37:11 I know T_Crash, go with a model bridge I suppose, it's less laggy, I was answering rick
bug-reports 2018-12-02 02:12:49 Easter egg, despawn and respawn to fix it
creations-chat 2018-12-02 02:20:59 Well, it's on a motor, what do you think?
creations-chat 2018-12-02 02:21:30 Check <#473249376223887371> to see what you need
bug-reports 2018-12-02 04:56:25 Don't leave the server first things first
bug-reports 2018-12-02 04:56:47 Find a save slot or save the object, then try overwriting redundant save slots with empty stuff
bug-reports 2018-12-02 04:56:57 Example: "5K boeing that you never use", overwrite it with literally a blank plot
bug-reports 2018-12-02 04:57:06 If that can't crank it down, disable RGB color saving on certain creations
bug-reports 2018-12-02 04:57:28 It's custom color saving
bug-reports 2018-12-02 04:57:37 Check the little cog right above the save icon
bug-reports 2018-12-02 04:58:14 Be sure to re-save, otherwise it won't have effect
bug-reports 2018-12-02 04:58:18 But don't be surprised if the paint's vastly off
bug-reports 2018-12-02 04:58:49 Alright, I'd suggest keeping it enabled for creations you value the most
bug-reports 2018-12-02 04:59:06 Wait, you can't?
bug-reports 2018-12-02 04:59:21 Huh, then try overriding some redundant save slots
bug-reports 2018-12-02 04:59:32 That's the little cog icon, I wasn't sure if he knew what the settings menu was
bug-reports 2018-12-02 05:00:32 Yeah
bug-reports 2018-12-02 05:01:02 Be warned: Any creation saved with RGB color saving off/false will have it's colors default to Roblox's core palette
bug-reports 2018-12-02 05:01:14 So your creation might be painted pink, then come out eye-vomit yellow
bug-reports 2018-12-02 05:01:22 Probably because you're too close to the save limit
bug-reports 2018-12-02 05:02:52 Hmmm, let's see
bug-reports 2018-12-02 05:03:11 That's a bug I'm unsure of gamesa, ask Rick about it, but if I had to guess, it had a checkmark over it, correct?
bug-reports 2018-12-02 05:04:01 Save it, delete it all, save that empty plot ontop of a build you haven't used
bug-reports 2018-12-02 05:04:32 One example would be after an update in the long past broke motors (they lagged, ALOT), I deleted most of my jet style crafts, because they were all variants of one that used motors to adjust the tail fins
creations-chat 2018-12-02 05:05:31 Use more control surfaces and space them out farther from the center of mass
creations-chat 2018-12-02 05:05:52 Using this as a demonstration
creations-chat 2018-12-02 05:06:28 The roll control surfaces are on the VERY tips of the wings for this creation
creations-chat 2018-12-02 05:07:29 Pitch and yaw don't matter, place them wherever, but roll does, you need it as far from the center as possible
creations-chat 2018-12-02 05:07:36 So place pitch and yaw on the inside, roll on the outside
creations-chat 2018-12-02 05:07:47 Also engines would help
bug-reports 2018-12-02 05:07:56 Still here, uhhhh, hmmm
bug-reports 2018-12-02 05:08:30 You might, MIGHT be good, make sure to double/tripple save your creation in the same slot, then see if it saved
bug-reports 2018-12-02 05:08:40 If not, talk to Rick about it, that's all the ways I know of how to fix it
creations-chat 2018-12-02 05:08:56 Well, if we're talking about control engines
creations-chat 2018-12-02 05:09:39 Pitch engines should be near the nose and rear of the craft
Yaw engines should be, again, near the nose and rear, but if you want them facing forwards and backwards, as far to the left and right as possible
Roll should be as far from the center as possible
bug-reports 2018-12-02 05:10:12 It's fine
creations-chat 2018-12-02 05:12:25 Control surfaces work at higher speeds
creations-chat 2018-12-02 05:12:44 Hence why my fighter, which uses a fusion of engine assistance and control surfaces, maintains a high degree of maneuverability at high velocities
bug-reports 2018-12-02 05:14:34 Well, if you leave the server, it should save properly
bug-reports 2018-12-02 05:14:39 If not, again, don't blame me, I did all I could
bug-reports 2018-12-02 05:16:51 Uhhhh, yeah you're over the save limit by the way
bug-reports 2018-12-02 05:17:04 Follow what I went over with rbk, scroll up if you wanna see
bug-reports 2018-12-02 05:19:57 Because you're saving a blank block normally, it doesn't care about what color it has, only that it's a block, and it winds up auto-painting the block
bug-reports 2018-12-02 05:20:07 But when you place this down, it has to remember what color you painted it
bug-reports 2018-12-02 05:20:13 Plus these blocks affect alot of stuff
bug-reports 2018-12-02 05:28:04 Wait, different colors, huh
bug-reports 2018-12-02 05:30:47 Seems like a bug, try jumping back and forth between the same colors
bug-reports 2018-12-02 05:37:19 Huh, very interesting, so you can basically black out a redundant creation to preserve it, or white it out in order to test if you're within safety margins
bug-reports 2018-12-02 05:40:35 Nah, it's fine
bug-reports 2018-12-02 14:26:56 He found a bug yesterday where if you paint the same block over and over, it occupies more and more space, until finally you can make a single block occupy the entire ~260K data you've got
bug-reports 2018-12-02 14:32:19 It's impossible to increase the save data size, and I'm very sure he's optimized it the best he could already
bug-reports 2018-12-02 14:32:50 I suggested it to him already
bug-reports 2018-12-02 14:37:21 Yeah, that's the catch I mentioned last time
bug-reports 2018-12-02 14:37:34 It saves per Roblox's own color palette, not custom RGB colors
help 2018-12-02 21:04:47 Half blocks have collisions as if they were whole blocks sadly
creations-chat 2018-12-02 23:31:17 It's implied at the same time
creations-chat 2018-12-02 23:31:44 Dude, can you cut it out for a bit? Seriously, you're flooding up <#384025409945337856>
creations-chat 2018-12-02 23:32:17 It either has to be an absurd payload, like with my over 100 block's worth of weight bomb, or it has to be a bunch of bombs
help 2018-12-02 23:33:31 If a spawn killer is an issue, no offense, but you have a bad build, and not only that, you have different spawn points, such as the airport and the water
creations-chat 2018-12-02 23:33:59 Someone made a cube and called it a creation, just a literal cube that was somehow forced to fly with an excess of wings and engines pointing straight upwards
help 2018-12-02 23:34:43 Right, I've made a tank that's extremely durable, fast and stable, and if you don't know how to make a plane after going over the tutorial and <#501034677793193994> , then sorry, but no amount of help will help you
creations-chat 2018-12-02 23:35:03 Spoilers, nobody considered it a creation, they have to have at least some bit of meaning
creations-chat 2018-12-02 23:35:17 That would actually be a creation for sure
help 2018-12-02 23:35:54 Check to see if any blocks are really high or are colliding with the top box, if not, you might've caught something under the floor
creations-chat 2018-12-02 23:36:12 ... Dude
creations-chat 2018-12-02 23:36:41 I am not an idiot, I am fully aware of what's a creation and what's a replica, a simple cube isn't a creation, it's just simply placing blocks in an arranged pattern
creations-chat 2018-12-02 23:36:45 Also that isn't even your boeing
help 2018-12-02 23:37:06 RIP, sorry Tommy
help 2018-12-02 23:37:22 Don't use always on/off thrusters and they'll maintain their thrust
help 2018-12-02 23:37:50 Also, <@318892614378061824> , again, look over the tutorial and <#501034677793193994> , if you can't figure it out with the detailed instructions there, then no amount of attempts to help you will be able to help you
help 2018-12-02 23:38:24 Yeahhh, no idea, sorry
creations-chat 2018-12-02 23:39:04 It's uncreative as hell, but it's a creation
creations-chat 2018-12-02 23:39:24 Flame, he means his planes, not the missiles
creations-chat 2018-12-02 23:39:45 You want creativity? A creation?
creations-chat 2018-12-02 23:40:08 This, this is a creation
creations-chat 2018-12-02 23:40:43 It's a fighter designed for absolute optimal performance, and it definitely shows
creations-chat 2018-12-02 23:41:31 It doesn't spin, it rips other fighters out of the air
creations-chat 2018-12-02 23:42:55 Even if I demonstrate it, 1: You'll probably doubt it
2: Anyone could tell just from it's design
3: If you ask around the server, you'll know that this thing's quite the terror
creations-chat 2018-12-02 23:44:15 You are, entirely wrong, did you not even bother to check the screwdriver tool, which was went over in the tutorial?
creations-chat 2018-12-02 23:44:25 At least, I believe it was, I haven't tried it
help 2018-12-02 23:45:33 You might be out of luck on those blocks, but I'd say a specific type of triangular wedge would be needed
help 2018-12-02 23:46:59 I don't think we have that particular wedge yet to be honest
help 2018-12-02 23:47:16 It's sort of a cube with a triangular wedge taken out of it
help 2018-12-02 23:47:25 Put that in suggestions if you want it
creations-chat 2018-12-02 23:49:26 John, learn the advanced mechanics of the game either via experimentation or asking people around in your server before you start judging other people's creations
creations-chat 2018-12-02 23:50:24 You've got John in your username, sooo
creations-chat 2018-12-03 00:11:26 Not bad, want any ranks for it?

creations-chat 2018-12-03 00:21:25 We've seen mechs and walkers of many sorts before, but we'll double check that particular mechanism
creations-chat 2018-12-03 00:22:55 Hey, it looks pretty nice!
creations-chat 2018-12-03 00:25:17 Care to show a video of it then?
creations-chat 2018-12-03 00:26:04 Mmmmm, just try to get a video if you could, it's a bit easier for us
creations-chat 2018-12-03 00:29:39 Looks like a stealth warship
creations-chat 2018-12-03 00:31:27 Well, ehhhh, it's a bit, vague, specifically the landkreuzer
creations-chat 2018-12-03 00:31:32 Let me check
creations-chat 2018-12-03 00:31:39 Wait no nevermind
creations-chat 2018-12-03 00:32:53 Missing a front gun, as well as some smaller turrets, but you did get the primary mechanisms correct
creations-chat 2018-12-03 00:33:08 Ehhhhh, I'll give it to the other mods, also hold on, let me show the others that
creations-chat 2018-12-03 00:33:41 Looks very bulky
creations-chat 2018-12-03 00:34:35 I don't mean the front turret, I mean the front gun, sorta like the one on the M3 Lee
creations-chat 2018-12-03 00:34:47 Wait no nevermind again
creations-chat 2018-12-03 00:35:02 Ehhhh, one more picture, this one of the front, and if the gun's there I'll give it
creations-chat 2018-12-03 00:36:07 Pretty cool, we're going over it now
creations-chat 2018-12-03 00:36:53 You need more upvotes Smokey
creations-chat 2018-12-03 00:37:00 Not sure
creations-chat 2018-12-03 00:37:20 First of all, more and wider wedges would be a good start
creations-chat 2018-12-03 00:49:05 Hey <@!255361087262818304> , hey, guess what?
creations-chat 2018-12-03 00:49:15 Guess
creations-chat 2018-12-03 00:49:24 Not a problem
creations-chat 2018-12-03 00:55:58 Erhm, try it again?
bug-reports 2018-12-03 04:27:56 I'm having issues! Motors aren't resetting!
bug-reports 2018-12-03 04:28:19 I need motors to reset back to their position in an organized fashion, otherwise chaos happens
bug-reports 2018-12-03 04:35:27 Well, it's part of the final project
bug-reports 2018-12-03 04:35:39 I'll show you one hint
bug-reports 2018-12-03 04:36:02 That's the only spoiler you're getting
bug-reports 2018-12-03 04:37:00 But motors don't work, I set them to speed 3, Y and H as the rotation keys (This thing's gonna be a nightmare to fly), and when I let go, they don't automatically rotate back to place
help 2018-12-03 22:50:37 Check the center of lift is my first guess <@318892614378061824>
creations-chat 2018-12-03 22:51:32 Not bad for a 5 minute build

help 2018-12-03 22:53:12 Your center of thrust is high, adding a force that's making it pitch downwards
help 2018-12-03 22:55:30 Then tweak it, the center of thrust is too low now
creations-chat 2018-12-04 00:13:48 Dude, seriously?
creations-chat 2018-12-04 00:14:06 Aero, just, seriously?
creations-chat 2018-12-04 00:14:41 Then please don't share them with us unless they're fine
creations-chat 2018-12-04 00:15:36 If it breaks Rule 2 I'm going to break your face (in the server sense, aka: A huge mute), got it?
creations-chat 2018-12-04 00:16:38 ... Disturbing, but it doesn't break the rule
creations-chat 2018-12-04 00:18:47 Okay can you cut it out with the disgusting/disturbing crud? It's freaking me out a bit
creations-chat 2018-12-04 00:19:49 You know you can have NSFW stuff on your phone and it's still "on your phone", right? That's not exactly an excuse ...
creations-chat 2018-12-04 00:22:06 Not Safe For Work, in other words, anything that's inappropriate
creations-chat 2018-12-04 00:26:26 It's for item size, also, dang, nice job lili, any engines in the blimp?
creations-chat 2018-12-04 01:05:05 So quite literally it's a tank that transforms into a jet?
creations-chat 2018-12-04 01:05:32 Why am I not surprised at this point Ignacioel

creations-chat 2018-12-04 02:55:49 Oh, right
creations-chat 2018-12-04 02:57:16 Ops, did someone give you master builder? I wonder who did that? (You're only 4 blocks away, may as well, also that was sarcasm by the way)
creations-chat 2018-12-04 03:00:40 Yeah?
creations-chat 2018-12-04 03:00:52 Ahem, pay attention to your stuff

creations-chat 2018-12-04 03:08:13 I expect it to barf out at least 10 notes
creations-chat 2018-12-04 03:08:24 And even then that might be modeler
creations-chat 2018-12-04 03:08:49 Already been done, it wasn't effective
creations-chat 2018-12-04 03:08:53 Yeup
creations-chat 2018-12-04 03:09:03 Next Inventor trophy's gotta be made outa silver thanks to Ignacioel
creations-chat 2018-12-04 03:09:25 Tank, if Sub can make a working calculator that actually calculates out the correct numbers, with at least basic + or -, then that'd probably be inventor
creations-chat 2018-12-04 03:09:55 Let me guess, more actual value Ignacioel?
creations-chat 2018-12-04 03:10:04 SUB! REMEMBER, it must calculate correct numbers
creations-chat 2018-12-04 03:10:22 It can't have a pre-determined set, it must calculate the correct values
creations-chat 2018-12-04 03:10:39 So if I do 9 + 9, it should give out 18
creations-chat 2018-12-04 03:11:05 Then sorry but n- FFS IGNACIOEL
creations-chat 2018-12-04 03:12:18 Then write down the idea to someone
creations-chat 2018-12-04 03:12:26 I've already got inventor, so don't worry about me stealing it
creations-chat 2018-12-04 03:12:48 Sounds good
creations-chat 2018-12-04 03:13:30 It's gotta have some theme, like mine's high performance military tech
creations-chat 2018-12-04 03:13:54 Hey, you could file under my company name ya know
creations-chat 2018-12-04 03:14:28 Basically you're co-creator for our company

creations-chat 2018-12-04 03:15:45 Alright
creations-chat 2018-12-04 03:16:17 Not with one button
creations-chat 2018-12-04 03:16:24 It needs to calculate out various equations
creations-chat 2018-12-04 03:16:36 Such as 9+9, or 4+1, and so on
creations-chat 2018-12-04 03:18:35 Sub, don't give others ideas!
creations-chat 2018-12-04 03:18:38 Someone might steal it from you

creations-chat 2018-12-04 04:07:09 Oy, Flame, I use it on my crafts and they perform amazingly, the thing is they compensate for a lack of control at low speeds
creations-chat 2018-12-04 04:14:55 God DAMN that's a nice Sopwith!

help 2018-12-07 05:14:42 Is it upper left, lower left, or right?
help 2018-12-07 05:15:25 <@!251995895405477888> , Which one is it, upper left, lower left, or lower right!?

help 2018-12-07 05:16:07 ... Tornado, if you're just trolling us
help 2018-12-07 05:16:34 It __**WILL, BUT THAT'S THE POINT OF SOME CRAFTS, PLUS IT'S SO INSIGNIFICANT THAT ANYONE WHO BUILDS ANYTHING OTHER THAN A FLYING BOX WON'T CARE**__
help 2018-12-07 05:17:26 ... Joey, next time if you want help with something, answer other people's questions so we know exactly what the problem is
help 2018-12-07 05:17:48 You were asking how to make something roll
help 2018-12-07 05:18:21 TA, FREAKING, DA
help 2018-12-07 05:18:58 Tornado, next time go "Yes I know how to roll, but won't it yaw?", then we'll know to not talk about roll anymore, but whether roll will affect yaw
help 2018-12-07 05:19:21 In this case **YES**, it will turn it slightly to the direction you rolled in
help 2018-12-07 05:19:37 Swiss, if I didn't know at least the basics of aerodynamics, I wouldn't be able to debug these issues
the-dump 2018-12-07 05:23:47 It's for barfing out general shit, basically anything that's, I suppose "meme-worthy"
creations-chat 2018-12-07 05:28:13 There's an in-game tutorial you know, and not all blocks are aerodynamically simulated
creations-chat 2018-12-07 05:28:37 Also you're still gonna have issues, I can already see the center of lift is too far back, so you're gonna faceplant into the ground due to the lift dragging your rear into the air, and nose into the ground
creations-chat 2018-12-07 05:30:25 Add wing panels to the nose, use ballast blocks in the back, helium in the front, just do whatever you need in order to drag the center of mass back, or the center of lift forwards
creations-chat 2018-12-07 05:45:21 It should be good now
creations-chat 2018-12-07 05:45:38 Although you might wanna bump the engines down lower to be parallel with the center of mass, as if they're high, they'll push you down as well
creations-chat 2018-12-07 05:49:13 What's what to be exact?
creations-chat 2018-12-07 05:49:57 Ah, the plane, ask Hydro about it
help 2018-12-07 05:51:11 It'll be unstable for sure, but it might not be bad
help 2018-12-07 05:51:15 Dunno, try it out
help 2018-12-07 05:52:52 RIP
creations-chat 2018-12-07 05:57:24 Wing panels don't connect on the top and bottom, only the sides
creations-chat 2018-12-07 05:57:32 Replace the ones you want connecting with regular or half blocks
help 2018-12-07 05:57:55 More wings = more drag, more engines obviously
help 2018-12-07 05:58:08 And there's a little thing we like to call intertia in the science industry
creations-chat 2018-12-07 05:58:17 How well does it perform?
help 2018-12-07 05:58:58 Yeup, in terms of building physics, we're kinda up there, but in terms of pure physics, there's probably other games that do it "better"
help 2018-12-07 05:59:08 Well, by building physics I mean building games' physics
creations-chat 2018-12-07 06:02:01 Not half bad designs
creations-chat 2018-12-07 06:04:39 It looks pretty nice to be honest
creations-chat 2018-12-07 06:08:17 Daaaamn Sub, huh
help 2018-12-07 06:15:15 Engines too high up maybe?

creations-chat 2018-12-07 06:41:30 <@251231135110135808> , center of lift may be too far back, push it forward with wings near the nose, helium at the front and ballast at the back
creations-chat 2018-12-07 06:43:38 Get upvotes if you want replicator
creations-chat 2018-12-07 06:47:14 It's fine
creations-chat 2018-12-07 06:49:08 No idea, sorry
creations-chat 2018-12-07 06:54:06 Check to see if it remains level, basically lob it off the other edge
creations-chat 2018-12-07 06:54:11 If it remains level, you're too freaking heavy, add more wings
creations-chat 2018-12-07 06:54:33 Lower the engines if that doesn't work, and add more frontal fins and control stuff
creations-chat 2018-12-07 07:40:16 Well, let's play it safe and say no
creations-chat 2018-12-07 15:36:34 You mean a lock system Dip? That's, probably already been made, also next time watch your language in the Plane Crazy chat
creations-chat 2018-12-07 15:37:04 In-game
creations-chat 2018-12-07 15:37:15 These things do boomerang around to bite you later down the line
creations-chat 2018-12-07 15:38:00 Anyways, people have made doors, people have made lock systems, sadly neither are impressive or new
creations-chat 2018-12-07 15:38:18 The ferry's not half bad
creations-chat 2018-12-07 15:40:16 Of course I am <@!404688801580187652>
creations-chat 2018-12-07 15:40:45 <@!159321283165814784> , place them down, then press C to jump to them, they connect similar to regular blocks
creations-chat 2018-12-07 15:43:01 Naboo starfighters have already been made, with accurate turning and such ...
creations-chat 2018-12-07 15:43:49 <@456226577798135808> , just because it's big, doesn't mean it's good, as Totten will tell you
creations-chat 2018-12-07 15:44:04 Yes it looks really nice, no it's not impressive
creations-chat 2018-12-07 15:44:22 What is is something that's big and can fly, because getting large things to fly is a pain and a half

creations-chat 2018-12-07 15:46:00 Hey, a little VTOL, not bad Marcus
creations-chat 2018-12-07 15:46:36 Ah crap, welp
creations-chat 2018-12-07 15:46:47 If anyone can give someone inventor, it's Ignacioel
creations-chat 2018-12-07 15:47:04 Ffff, fine, go for it Ignacioel
creations-chat 2018-12-07 15:47:06 And that's not how it works
creations-chat 2018-12-07 15:47:16 You post a picture, it's save slot, and to expedite stuff, you request it
creations-chat 2018-12-07 15:47:35 By the way, HE has to be the one to build it, and you can't just hold his hand all the way through
creations-chat 2018-12-07 15:47:40 Marcus, post the save slot here
creations-chat 2018-12-07 15:47:51 <@456226577798135808> , **FUCK NO**, you have to post the save slot
creations-chat 2018-12-07 15:47:56 ... Not what I meant
creations-chat 2018-12-07 15:48:11 Post a picture of the save slot that you have saved it in
creations-chat 2018-12-07 15:48:21 Check your ranks again ...
creations-chat 2018-12-07 15:49:00 There we go, that works out Marcus, er, one last thing, mind showing us the username? I know, "Oh there's so many steps", it's to make sure you aren't mooching off of someone else's work
creations-chat 2018-12-07 15:49:13 ... Not, what I meant
creations-chat 2018-12-07 15:49:17 As in show us in the picture
creations-chat 2018-12-07 15:49:24 Theeeere we go
creations-chat 2018-12-07 15:49:43 Done, enjoy your ranks
creations-chat 2018-12-07 15:50:03 Show us the ferry?
creations-chat 2018-12-07 15:50:19 Also, <@456226577798135808> , do you WANT to bug the admins and mods again? Seriously?
creations-chat 2018-12-07 15:53:03 ... Dip, how the hell is it my fucking fault if you're the one who got yourself banned earlier, and can't even show the save slot currently? Now don't accuse me of blame that's yours, I get enough of that shit in real life to recognize it, and I've had enough of it
creations-chat 2018-12-07 15:53:18 Hold on <@!159321283165814784> , checking the ranks a bit
creations-chat 2018-12-07 15:54:06 Good rule of thumb SubZero: If you can think it up in under a month's worth of time, it's probably already been made
creations-chat 2018-12-07 15:54:12 Also, ranks given Marcus
creations-chat 2018-12-07 15:57:46 Probably because I'm not an admin, and not only that, I actually bother enforcing the rules with the equivalent of a steel bat
creations-chat 2018-12-07 15:58:20 ... Okay the others do enforce the rules to, but to be honest I've been through alot in the server, don't ask, we'd be here all month
creations-chat 2018-12-07 16:00:30 MIB?
creations-chat 2018-12-07 16:01:03 Ah, that'd count for modeler probably, but at the same time Ignacioel beat you at mono-wheels
creations-chat 2018-12-07 16:32:28 RIP, upscaling stuff allows for more detail
creations-chat 2018-12-07 16:39:49 You've got bigger problems, <#384021699466756107> , now
creations-chat 2018-12-07 16:40:32 Then I'll drag it over here, since you so blatantly refuse to come over here

creations-chat 2018-12-07 16:40:38 **EXPLAIN THIS**
creations-chat 2018-12-07 16:41:40 I have, it's more impressive than what you can do, what the hell did I say about actions in-game will affect you in the Discord server?
creations-chat 2018-12-07 16:43:27 ... <@!284945768564129793> , people can express what they want, can you please learn to just accept it? I mean, nobody complains about your pictures/ideas/icons, right?
creations-chat 2018-12-07 16:47:06 <@456226577798135808> , don't try this dance with me, I've had to do it before with a hypocryte calling me "negger", and I'll out-dance you as well (If you don't understand witty commentary, basically someone tried to put off hiding "nig" with "neg" as stating someone else's video, for no apparent reason, directed at me)
creations-chat 2018-12-07 16:48:28 I believe so, but we don't have in-game powers yet (Madattak needs to get on that, since he technically owns the game, but he's against it for some reason)
creations-chat 2018-12-07 16:48:37 READ THE RULES BEFORE PINGING MAD OR RICK FOR ANYTHING
creations-chat 2018-12-07 16:48:47 Just, read the rules before doing so, alright?
creations-chat 2018-12-07 16:49:10 Anyways, that's a seriously nice TIE
creations-chat 2018-12-07 16:50:07 ... Simply put don't ping Mad and Rick, they tend to be very busy
creations-chat 2018-12-07 16:50:28 But anyways, team-build is already in progress, other ideas, first check <#507673335816126509> , then if you don't find your thing, check <#491710474786832394>
creations-chat 2018-12-07 16:51:01 Because some people brush off the fucking rules Dip ...
creations-chat 2018-12-07 16:51:25 Then don't comment about it
creations-chat 2018-12-07 16:52:11 The reason I mention things are either one of, multiple of
1: Someone did it in the past or something related to it
2: They are pre-emptive measures
3: To maintain order
creations-chat 2018-12-07 16:52:23 DIP, you already requested inventor, now show us what it can do that's so inventor-worthy
creations-chat 2018-12-07 16:53:18 Just post it here
creations-chat 2018-12-07 16:53:41 And if it's a .wmv after I shouted about how risky .wmv files are, and after the pinned messages, so help me ...
creations-chat 2018-12-07 16:57:59 ... Alright, what's the idea, multiple drivable vehicles?
creations-chat 2018-12-07 16:58:58 That's not inventor, people have made entire flight formations before
creations-chat 2018-12-07 16:59:55 That's not a tank, that's an oversized car
creations-chat 2018-12-07 17:00:01 And those aren't bikes, those are cars
creations-chat 2018-12-07 17:00:27 Ignacioel, he got your idea, but choked on the execution so badly
creations-chat 2018-12-07 17:01:01 Let me put it this way, if you can think of it in under one month, it's PROBABLY already been made
creations-chat 2018-12-07 17:01:13 Unless you're either very witty, very skilled, ambitious, or Ignacioel himself
creations-chat 2018-12-07 17:01:29 That's modeler Mystic
creations-chat 2018-12-07 17:02:44 With actual tank treads? Yeah, no, already been done
creations-chat 2018-12-07 17:03:19 So basically a russian stacking, tank
creations-chat 2018-12-07 17:03:48 ... <@456226577798135808> , then quit asking for inventor, if you can't bother thinking, then don't bother going for something that requires you using your brain for something other than garbage insults
creations-chat 2018-12-07 17:04:29 Because they kept on trying to help you, and you just told them to fuck off
help 2018-12-07 17:04:47 Ahem
creations-chat 2018-12-07 17:05:24 Then try putting it in a way that isn't as rude as hell
creations-chat 2018-12-07 17:06:50 ... You can't even quote me correctly, 
"then quit asking for inventor, if you can't bother thinking, then don't bother going for something that requires you using your brain for something other than garbage insults"
creations-chat 2018-12-07 17:07:12 Inventor is the hardest and most mentally taxing role out there
creations-chat 2018-12-07 17:07:48 ... Dip, are you sure you're not drunk or something?
creations-chat 2018-12-07 17:08:15 Uhhhh, are you serious Dip, are you actually 11?
creations-chat 2018-12-07 17:08:45 Sorry, Discord Terms of Service requires us that we request you to leave, let me find the category for you
creations-chat 2018-12-07 17:09:47 
creations-chat 2018-12-07 17:10:07 We request that you leave
creations-chat 2018-12-07 17:10:13 Yes, and we'll whack-a-mole them down as they appear
creations-chat 2018-12-07 17:11:00 "If you are between 13 and the age of majority in your jurisdiction"
creations-chat 2018-12-07 17:11:04 You are 11, doesn't count
creations-chat 2018-12-07 17:11:35 It's gotta react, that's the one caveat here
creations-chat 2018-12-07 17:12:14 ... <@456226577798135808> , OY! ACTUALLY READ IT! I LITERALLY HIGHLIGHTED THE AREA YOU NEED TO READ
creations-chat 2018-12-07 17:12:31 ...
creations-chat 2018-12-07 17:12:51 I am about to take executive action on a certain dumbass' face
creations-chat 2018-12-07 17:12:57 Dip
creations-chat 2018-12-07 17:13:06 DipTheKing_II
creations-chat 2018-12-07 17:13:09 I highlighted the area
creations-chat 2018-12-07 17:13:19 https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/504436696021204992/520648131814096896/Capture_63.PNG
creations-chat 2018-12-07 17:13:30 I literally highlighted the area you need to read
creations-chat 2018-12-07 17:13:34 And you REFUSE TO READ IT
creations-chat 2018-12-07 17:13:50 Then put your eyes to the screen and read that area over, thoroughly
creations-chat 2018-12-07 17:14:20 If you acted more maturely and sensibly, maybe we'd allow you in
creations-chat 2018-12-07 17:14:25 Use Google
creations-chat 2018-12-07 17:17:09 Let's be honest, some people act more mature than full blown adults, so we allow them here
creations-chat 2018-12-07 17:17:55 I think that rocket counts if you can check the speed
creations-chat 2018-12-07 17:18:02 Dip, you're right, you're worse
creations-chat 2018-12-07 17:18:50 Marcus, ask him to clock the speed, he did one part of the Elon Musk challenge, if he can do part 2 and get a picture of his speed somehow, and if he's on this Discord, he'll get the rank
creations-chat 2018-12-07 17:19:24 Yes yes, we get it Dip, you're modeling after shit people, get over it
creations-chat 2018-12-07 17:19:34 Now can you please leave as per the Discord Terms of Service?
creations-chat 2018-12-07 17:19:53 If you maybe acted more maturely, we would've not batted an eye
creations-chat 2018-12-07 17:20:01 Ah
creations-chat 2018-12-07 17:20:07 Well, that counts, hold on a bit
creations-chat 2018-12-07 17:20:19 Done Marcus
creations-chat 2018-12-07 17:20:30 And no it's not a job
creations-chat 2018-12-07 17:20:47 Last time I tried that Xpert shut me down Ignacioel, he NEEDS to do something, although
creations-chat 2018-12-07 17:21:50 DipTheKing_II admitted to being underage to use Discord, as per the terms of service
creations-chat 2018-12-07 17:22:14 And he absolutely REFUSES to do pretty much anything anyone asks him, not even bothering to read the outlined section here https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/504436696021204992/520648131814096896/Capture_63.PNG
creations-chat 2018-12-07 17:22:55 ...
creations-chat 2018-12-07 17:23:16 Here's how
creations-chat 2018-12-07 17:25:23 Marcus, if you act mature and kind to others, we might not bat some eyes to it, because some people have a mental maturity of 60 year olds, in the body of 10 year olds
creations-chat 2018-12-07 17:25:58 Or, whatever batting your eye means, basically just act like you're grown up and responsible already
creations-chat 2018-12-07 17:27:27 That's highly unbelievable, I'd believe 1 business and 1 mansion, and even then with alot of assistance from the parents
creations-chat 2018-12-07 17:27:53 Nice, same here

creations-chat 2018-12-08 00:04:04 Sorry, but you can't publish save .wmvs, convert it to some other form
creations-chat 2018-12-08 00:04:50 Something that'd run naturally on Discord
the-dump 2018-12-08 00:19:27 Uhhhh, <@282872552886501377> , that last one was really pushing it, so I wiped it, mind toning it down a bit?
creations-chat 2018-12-08 00:30:40 Reblex, mags like were actually around for a freaking long while believe it or not
creations-chat 2018-12-08 00:31:17 I'm getting alot of internet lag, RIP
help 2018-12-08 00:31:31 You need to entirely disable RGB coloring
help 2018-12-08 00:31:46 So you can't use half custom colors and half pre-set colors, either all or none
creations-chat 2018-12-08 00:32:24 Anyways, I call those kinds of mags grav mags, magazines that use gravity to pull the round down, before the age of magnets we used jets to simulate the projectiles launching out
creations-chat 2018-12-08 00:32:26 Those aren't new, at all
bug-reports 2018-12-09 03:26:19 Give it a spin
bug-reports 2018-12-09 03:26:57 A real life bullet keeps it's self stable by spinning in the air (At least if my firearms knowledge is correct), same with certain objects, including rockets I think
bug-reports 2018-12-09 03:34:09 I mean a bullet has a spin applied to it via the barrel in order to keep it stable in the air
creations-chat 2018-12-09 18:08:20 Maybe it was borrowed from/by the Japanese or something?
creations-chat 2018-12-10 04:05:45 Steal them and give credit, that way you'll act as free advertising for their original creators

help 2018-12-11 00:10:10 I'll explain

help 2018-12-11 00:11:08 They will attach like regular blocks to
help 2018-12-11 00:11:40 Yes, Prov, it should've been obvious when I said "they act like regular blocks", namely considering regular blocks weld on all connectable sides
help 2018-12-11 00:12:00 Which, for the regular 1X1X1 block, is all 6 faces of the cube
help 2018-12-11 00:16:58 Right, wing blocks can only attach on the side, not above or below them, replace the wing panel with a half block pointed either up or down, or a whole block

help 2018-12-12 00:06:23 They act as the main pilot seat, but you don't spawn in them
help 2018-12-12 00:06:28 Meaning you can control them from different areas
help 2018-12-12 00:06:42 The main pilot seat teleports you to it, that's your "spawn point" on the craft essentially

creations-chat 2018-12-13 00:47:39 Congrats, you have ranks, please check over <#507673335816126509> to see if your suggestion's already there before suggesting, and think about what you want to suggest long and hard
creations-chat 2018-12-13 02:19:21 <@!387803965728882689> , that's literally the tutorial VTOL that one guy made, except without the VTOL component
creations-chat 2018-12-13 02:20:35 Two massive "tines" (spear-like points) on the front half, very tiny single block section on the rear half, with a single block wide space on the side of the tines for fitting the motors on
creations-chat 2018-12-13 02:21:56 Aside from a few slight modifications, it's pretty much exactly like a plane someone else made
creations-chat 2018-12-13 02:23:06 It's not uncommon, as you see by the two tines on my fighter, but you can definitely make not only the tines more distinct, but the actual craft's body and other wings more distinct as well
creations-chat 2018-12-13 21:25:25 That's called trolling ...

creations-chat 2018-12-14 03:53:41 Don't suggest anything stupid please
creations-chat 2018-12-14 03:53:50 (By the way, yes, that means you got your ranks)

creations-chat 2018-12-14 06:55:48 Ahem
creations-chat 2018-12-14 16:05:15 There's alot of static AA devices, it's unimpressive to say the least to be perfectly honest
creations-chat 2018-12-14 16:05:36 If you want impressive, make the guns and rockets both scatter outwards upon firing
creations-chat 2018-12-14 16:06:05 Show the save slot?
creations-chat 2018-12-14 16:06:33 I meant Flow, but, well, alright
creations-chat 2018-12-14 16:07:33 I'm giving Floating Fortress early because it looks like it can fit a few well designed fighters on it
creations-chat 2018-12-14 16:07:59 I've gotten pretty good with judging landing zones, and it seems like any carrier capable craft should be able to land on it
creations-chat 2018-12-14 16:08:17 Use folding
creations-chat 2018-12-14 16:40:47 I mean, it's not half bad, "Hammerhead"?
creations-chat 2018-12-14 16:41:56 I mean, I myself went from this
creations-chat 2018-12-14 16:42:04 To this
creations-chat 2018-12-14 16:44:09 Yeah, so don't worry, try visualizing and building upon it
creations-chat 2018-12-15 21:26:00 Be a bit patient next time, we all have our own lives you know
bug-reports 2018-12-15 21:32:58 Well, as long as Imperial's fine with it being copied, else, erase it, now
creations-chat 2018-12-15 22:55:12 Seems like he tried to copy, especially considering the general nose/cockpit shape, engine positioning, and dual rotor style
creations-chat 2018-12-15 22:56:16 How much you wanna bet he's tealur?
creations-chat 2018-12-15 23:01:08 You need to sort it out, and it's up to the mods' decision, followed by the original owner
creations-chat 2018-12-15 23:01:36 If it's something highly cloneable, like a 10 part plane, no issue, if you copy a 1K part plane bit by bit, you're done
creations-chat 2018-12-15 23:02:35 If the other person allows it, it's not really copying now is it?
creations-chat 2018-12-15 23:46:48 Looks like a stubby space shuttle thing made for combat, pretty cool
creations-chat 2018-12-15 23:49:36 Not a problem, do note: The 3 important things in fighting other fighters are maneuverability (Can be compensated for by a high amount of speed), durability, and firepower (Specifically how you arrange them)
creations-chat 2018-12-15 23:50:17 For ground vehicle, it's speed (can't be compensated for by maneuverability sadly), firepower, and durability, specifically downwards facing rockets or a good aim
creations-chat 2018-12-15 23:51:32 I use keyboard controls
creations-chat 2018-12-15 23:51:44 Mouse controls only work with control surfaces, and at higher speeds
creations-chat 2018-12-15 23:52:01 But at those speeds, combat is impossible, due to the fact that by the time you're properly pointed at something, it's whizzed by already
creations-chat 2018-12-16 00:41:34 Want a rank for that <@!442355784018558976> ?

creations-chat 2018-12-16 06:03:23 Look at your ranks
creations-chat 2018-12-16 06:04:32 Is it 500+ parts?
creations-chat 2018-12-16 06:04:45 Ah, nevermind Yoko
creations-chat 2018-12-16 06:04:47 I see it
creations-chat 2018-12-16 06:04:51 Give me a moment linh
creations-chat 2018-12-16 06:06:33 Ehhhh, to be honest it looks fairly blocky, make the fuselage rounder, drag out the nose or add something more distinct
creations-chat 2018-12-16 06:08:13 Maybe mix up the color scheme and it might help
creations-chat 2018-12-16 06:08:34 I'm on "me time", but I'll let you see something that counts for modeler
creations-chat 2018-12-16 06:08:42 
creations-chat 2018-12-16 06:09:09 Er, whops, sorry Yoko
creations-chat 2018-12-16 06:09:24 Fixed it Tornado
creations-chat 2018-12-16 06:10:00 Not a problem, if you need any ranking, contact me (with proof) and you're pretty much garunteed a rank (when I'm on)
creations-chat 2018-12-16 06:10:13 Mind showing the save slot?
creations-chat 2018-12-16 06:10:32 Yeah
creations-chat 2018-12-16 06:10:48 Also I think it's time to revise the builder role to have the double limitation for both land and sea
creations-chat 2018-12-16 06:11:17 I'll give it to you anyways because it seems like you did put alot of effort and detail into it
creations-chat 2018-12-16 06:12:08 Anyways, you can check out my fighter for something like modeler, I posted a screenshot but cleared it out of <#384025409945337856> , since I already posted it there
creations-chat 2018-12-16 06:14:22 I'd say it's easy, considering you can stockpile creations and just vomit them all at once and grab all the roles
creations-chat 2018-12-16 06:14:35 So no special rank for grabbing a ton of ranks at one time

creations-chat 2018-12-16 06:16:10 Back before jet engines were nerfed (I think so at least), this thing could fly and drop all the bombs
creations-chat 2018-12-16 06:16:21 The refitted version should be able to carry the bombs easily
creations-chat 2018-12-16 06:17:02 You may notice those blocks are yellow, and none of the blocks are painted
creations-chat 2018-12-16 06:17:14 And if you think thoroughly, you may realize that ballasts start off yellow
creations-chat 2018-12-16 06:17:31 Yoko, biggest issue with helis: For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction
creations-chat 2018-12-16 06:17:36 Solve that and you can make a heli

creations-chat 2018-12-17 21:05:21 You have a superior rank due to the airliner and double requirements on buses
creations-chat 2018-12-17 21:07:39 Well, you'll still get the other ranks, but you need both upvotes and for it to be based off of a real life object for it to be replicator
creations-chat 2018-12-17 21:09:12 Pretty cool, rough estimate of parts: 140-160ish
creations-chat 2018-12-17 21:09:36 Mind posting a picture of the save slot? You'll still get other applicable ranks

creations-chat 2018-12-17 21:56:13 It actually isn't
creations-chat 2018-12-17 21:56:28 This is what happened when a rocket directly hit the "spinal" area, as I call it
help 2018-12-17 21:56:38 Yeah
creations-chat 2018-12-17 21:57:07 Right behind the cockpit
creations-chat 2018-12-17 21:58:42 GG on that front
creations-chat 2018-12-17 21:59:00 Anyways, the MK3's durability is very impressive isn't it?
creations-chat 2018-12-17 22:00:30 1X1 blocks and wing panels have as much health as a 1X7 beam or a 1X4 wing panel
help 2018-12-17 22:00:45 It's your issue sadly
creations-chat 2018-12-17 22:00:56 Don't blame me for this idea!
creations-chat 2018-12-17 22:00:59 And I believe so
creations-chat 2018-12-17 22:01:57 I think 1X1s are stronger against guns (Which you'll mostly want to use), but weaker against missiles (You sorta don't want to use these)
help 2018-12-17 22:02:27 Not a problem
creations-chat 2018-12-17 22:03:02 I'd say just go 1X1
creations-chat 2018-12-17 22:04:42 Pfff, good call deleting that LastGame
creations-chat 2018-12-17 22:05:35 Er, don't ask
help 2018-12-17 22:09:48 You want it VTOL hovering or helium hovering?
help 2018-12-17 22:10:21 Add helium to the top, add ballasts at the bottom, add rocket engines to the top and give it a spin
help 2018-12-17 22:11:12 Ever notice how a little toy top just refuses to fall over until it stops spinning?
help 2018-12-17 22:15:16 Seriously? Huh, even with all the things I said?
help 2018-12-17 22:16:25 Well, think of how an arrow works, and simulate it in here, there's a force near the center, but the tail's being dragged backwards
bug-reports 2018-12-17 22:16:55 Well you succeeded, you managed to get one of my friends, who hates engineering, to invest about a whole day's worth of time out of a week at one point
bug-reports 2018-12-17 22:17:19 In other words, 24 out of their 168 hours for the week
bug-reports 2018-12-17 22:18:04 Not every single game, but 99.9999% of them (at least on Roblox)
bug-reports 2018-12-17 22:20:00 Honestly, I don't think a tip jar or something of the sort would be really immoral at this point (I've seen people in the past claim they're just "tip jars", which give added benifits, such as extra map votes per purchase and such)
bug-reports 2018-12-17 22:25:33 That's one thing we talked about, only connects to the base, so you can't use it as a fancy joint, it's basically just a tiny flag to stick on your vehicle
creations-chat 2018-12-17 22:26:21 Imperial, your boeing's made of adamantium for crud's sake, of course it can be split in half and still fly
bug-reports 2018-12-17 22:26:39 Well, er, yeah actually that makes sense
bug-reports 2018-12-17 22:27:15 Also this is <#498473314445033472> , but we aren't talking about a bug, oh hey look a ladybug, nevermind

creations-chat 2018-12-17 22:30:23 Oy, none of those jokes if you don't mind
creations-chat 2018-12-17 22:32:51 Same with mine, although they're smaller for sure, they're still combat-capable after all of that
creations-chat 2018-12-17 22:33:03 They don't just putter home after all of that damage, they can still fight pretty viciously
creations-chat 2018-12-17 22:51:19 That's pretty cool
creations-chat 2018-12-17 22:51:40 They were correct, it seems to fit better
creations-chat 2018-12-17 23:07:21 ... I'll give you a chance to erase that
creations-chat 2018-12-17 23:09:25 Only if it's for historical accuracy, if you put random Swastikas on planes, you're going to get banned for it
creations-chat 2018-12-17 23:09:48 You need to build a WW2 german plane that had a swastika on it at one point or another, and claim historical accuracy, and it needs to be VERY detailed
creations-chat 2018-12-17 23:10:51 ... <@456226577798135808> , if you do that, we will ban you
creations-chat 2018-12-17 23:10:57 That is not historical accuracy in the slightest
creations-chat 2018-12-17 23:11:09 It's not
creations-chat 2018-12-17 23:11:39 You are <@!251493349981159436>
creations-chat 2018-12-17 23:12:02 And <@456226577798135808> , again, you will be banned for such an act, it needs to be a historically accurate WW2 plane that had the symbol on it at some point
creations-chat 2018-12-17 23:12:23 Reaver?
creations-chat 2018-12-17 23:14:33 ...
creations-chat 2018-12-17 23:14:49 <@456226577798135808> , do I need to warn you gain for those kinds of jokes?
creations-chat 2018-12-17 23:16:31 If you replicate that in a way that it's recognizable, you'll get the "historical accuracy" pass, so long as it's only on the tail
creations-chat 2018-12-17 23:17:12 Just remember, it needs to be easily recognizable as it's WW2 real life counterpart
creations-chat 2018-12-17 23:18:16 <#497142796961054721> or <#495286269459300364> if you don't mind
creations-chat 2018-12-17 23:18:47 We have chat logs you know!
creations-chat 2018-12-17 23:19:04 Now quit acting stupid and highly obnoxious before you get kicked
creations-chat 2018-12-17 23:20:09 Just a kick for now
creations-chat 2018-12-17 23:20:13 If he tries again though
creations-chat 2018-12-17 23:59:42 Ah, it's too heavy?
creations-chat 2018-12-18 00:21:01 Add more helium all-round to make it lighter
the-dump 2018-12-18 02:16:27 No
bug-reports 2018-12-18 02:21:27 Issue: Engine noises keep on happening, even with sounds off, I'm gonna blame the fact that I have so many that it's overloading the system, so it can't mute them all
creations-chat 2018-12-18 02:47:35 Not half bad
creations-chat 2018-12-18 02:47:45 Show the part count?
creations-chat 2018-12-18 02:50:10 I would've called it the Albatross to be honest

creations-chat 2018-12-18 06:27:57 You beached it, how do you beach a freaking tank?
creations-chat 2018-12-18 06:28:08 Oy, Tornado, none of that
the-dump 2018-12-18 17:46:32 Taking that one down in the event that it's considered NSFW ...
creations-chat 2018-12-18 18:41:15 Make it a gif or something if you don't mind

the-dump 2018-12-19 03:41:29 Welp
the-dump 2018-12-19 03:41:38 Now I'm a gentleman dragon aren't I?
creations-chat 2018-12-19 20:45:05 Wait how is it player chasing?
creations-chat 2018-12-19 20:45:39 Is it yours?
creations-chat 2018-12-19 20:45:55 Welp
help 2018-12-19 21:07:11 You want an upwards force near the nose, and a downwards force near the tail
help 2018-12-19 21:08:05 Sorta, think of how an arrow works to stabilize it's self
help 2018-12-19 21:08:12 There's drag on the tail to keep it straight
creations-chat 2018-12-19 21:15:06 Ouch, the heck?
creations-chat 2018-12-19 21:15:10 What happened to the first one?
creations-chat 2018-12-19 21:15:56 You might wanna check your E-mail account, someone probably hacked into it
creations-chat 2018-12-19 21:16:33 The password was changed twice, meaning likely someone wanted to try to capture it and pretend to be you
creations-chat 2018-12-19 21:16:47 So by the third one, they think you're the one doing it, and you get the blame
creations-chat 2018-12-19 21:17:54 What are you replicating?
creations-chat 2018-12-19 21:19:27 Close enough to be a Phantom definitely
creations-chat 2018-12-19 21:19:34 You need upvotes though
creations-chat 2018-12-19 21:20:53 You can earn every rank in one creation if it can do all of them
creations-chat 2018-12-19 21:25:50 Not bad, part count or just for show?
creations-chat 2018-12-19 21:26:25 Alright
bug-reports 2018-12-19 21:31:55 I mean, think of how much effort this game would require
the-dump 2018-12-19 21:34:01 Try that again jacky and see what happens
creations-chat 2018-12-19 21:41:17 Propeller master requires zero engines
creations-chat 2018-12-19 21:41:22 Not even for maneuvering
creations-chat 2018-12-19 21:41:54 Magic, and lots of engineering skill
bug-reports 2018-12-19 21:53:18 How viable is a rewrite exactly?
creations-chat 2018-12-19 22:37:32 You wanna try it again?
creations-chat 2018-12-20 01:43:52 Pretty cool
the-dump 2018-12-20 04:05:39 Don't let this be your first ...

the-dump 2018-12-20 04:07:17 Yeeeeeeeup
the-dump 2018-12-20 20:34:13 I'm gonna stop it before it goes too far
the-dump 2018-12-20 20:34:29 Nah, no more
the-dump 2018-12-20 20:35:11 ... <@!340543153922768906> , ENOUGH

creations-chat 2018-12-20 22:32:12 Wait that's by the bot
creations-chat 2018-12-20 22:32:49 Ah, there we go
creations-chat 2018-12-20 22:35:07 You got it, but I think you miiiiight miss out on this application, sorry
help 2018-12-20 22:58:31 It's custom color saving
help 2018-12-20 22:58:42 Basically it lets you save specific colors, rather than use Roblox's custom color palette
help 2018-12-20 22:58:58 Disabling it means your colors will default to Roblox's standards, but it will also use alot less save data
help 2018-12-20 23:00:49 Doom, not quite
help 2018-12-20 23:01:10 There's a set color palette that Roblox uses, it'll automatically try to assign your color to whatever's the closest value when you save
creations-chat 2018-12-21 01:29:33 ... <@!368630214747619340> <@!168154760866693120> , both of you, cut it out
the-dump 2018-12-21 01:55:57 Talk about a smackdown
the-dump 2018-12-21 02:06:24 Er, volume warning on that one, my ears
the-dump 2018-12-21 02:07:31 It's fine
creations-chat 2018-12-21 04:18:16 New updated Dragon, featuring missile pods now alongside it's already excessive firepower
creations-chat 2018-12-21 04:21:10 Wa- make this thing transform
creations-chat 2018-12-21 04:21:15 This, monstrosity of a fighter, transform?
creations-chat 2018-12-21 04:21:23 Are you kidding me Ignacioel?
creations-chat 2018-12-21 04:21:43 I'm literally hitting the build limits here with this thing! How am I supposed to make it transform into anything while still making it useful?

creations-chat 2018-12-21 04:40:55 
creations-chat 2018-12-21 04:42:32 MTOW?
creations-chat 2018-12-21 04:44:12 Well let me put it this way, the Wyrm, the first variant of the Dragon ever made, before jet engines were nerfed, could carry this much https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/518891282177851402/519363606144483338/Capture_63.PNG
creations-chat 2018-12-21 04:44:36 Those are all max weight ballasts by the way
creations-chat 2018-12-21 04:44:50 Yeup
creations-chat 2018-12-21 04:45:13 Now some midway between jets and rockets were the old jets' strength, but now we have super rockets
creations-chat 2018-12-21 04:45:45 The King Dragon's about 1.4K
creations-chat 2018-12-21 04:47:23 Well now I need to test out max weight by strapping a block on the bottom
creations-chat 2018-12-21 19:24:41 Looks like a modernized ME-262
creations-chat 2018-12-21 19:27:16 Hooooly SH- okay then
creations-chat 2018-12-21 19:28:09 I mean, by technicalities it'd get master builder as the rank, due to the fact that we still need Xpert to update the rank requirement to be surface, rather than land vehicles, but, screw it, I'm gonna give you server exterminator anyways, if for nothing else than the fully detailed interior
creations-chat 2018-12-21 19:29:09 Like, seriously, damn that thing's huge and impressive
creations-chat 2018-12-21 19:30:58 I mean, it's not half bad
creations-chat 2018-12-21 19:36:05 I mean, the Ragnarok has a ton of wings
help 2018-12-21 19:37:28 They're probably going to be an opt-in thing to be honest
help 2018-12-21 19:39:36 It was uninteresting at the time
help 2018-12-21 19:42:28 Planned in the future already
help 2018-12-21 19:43:02 My hope is that fuel acts like Terra Tech, where it's only used for specific engines (Or as an afterburner in this case) and regenerates mid-flight
the-dump 2018-12-21 19:43:46 Oh **GOD** what did you invite Rick?
the-dump 2018-12-21 19:46:16 Oh god even Rick's joining in!
the-dump 2018-12-21 19:55:35 Sonnuy, no offense but do you honestly just come on in order to bug everyone about every decision they make? Like, this isn't the first time where, very coincidentially, you just came on and started criticizing people of their actions, especially related to Discord
the-dump 2018-12-21 19:57:16 Now it's Mad
the-dump 2018-12-21 19:57:36 Watch as Madattak pops on, I'd imagine his head would explode from the chaos
the-dump 2018-12-21 19:59:17 Doesn't really work like that
the-dump 2018-12-21 19:59:26 It's smart enough to not count spam, sooo
the-dump 2018-12-21 19:59:40 I mean, you don't see the server updates exploding with level ups do you?
the-dump 2018-12-21 19:59:49 Are we just gonna roll through the entire list?
the-dump 2018-12-21 20:00:24 I'm gonna just stay out of the chaos, jesus freaking christ
the-dump 2018-12-21 20:08:21 Make the call and I'm gonna end it
creations-chat 2018-12-21 21:12:10 Okay, yes, the starter plane, what about it?
creations-chat 2018-12-21 21:12:44 It's still in <#384025409945337856> you know
creations-chat 2018-12-22 00:36:42 You need a force at the bottom to keep it straight, and a force near the nose to keep it pointing forwards, you obviously can't do the force near the nose, so you need most of the weight to be at the bottom
creations-chat 2018-12-22 01:37:22 Did somebody order an exterminator?
creations-chat 2018-12-22 01:37:28 
creations-chat 2018-12-22 01:39:59 I actually wonder if the King Dragon can carry your Blitzer
creations-chat 2018-12-22 01:40:33 Like seriously, the Wyrm (My first fighter since the major updates) could carry pretty much twice, if not 3 times it's weight on a bomb strapped to it's underbelly
creations-chat 2018-12-22 01:40:37 And that was with jets
creations-chat 2018-12-22 02:07:05 You, aren't going to get a rank, for what's basically a poor go-kart using blocks and half blocks
creations-chat 2018-12-22 02:09:25 You need upvotes for replicator, and self-upvotes and bot upvotes don't count
help 2018-12-22 02:57:18 What do ya need help with?
help 2018-12-22 02:57:25 It rotates in the opposite direction?
help 2018-12-22 02:57:54 Yeah, that's a law of physics acting there
help 2018-12-22 02:57:59 For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction
help 2018-12-22 02:59:17 Again, for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction
help 2018-12-22 03:01:24 Just think about what I stated for a moment
help 2018-12-22 03:04:26 The action of the propeller rotating is causing a reaction that affects your craft
help 2018-12-22 03:04:45 Actually, there was a test, the propeller blades in that orientation provide the most efficient movement
creations-chat 2018-12-22 03:18:19 All-terrain on crack?
creations-chat 2018-12-22 03:19:00 Might take a swing at modeler actually
creations-chat 2018-12-22 03:19:22 Nevermind you already have it
creations-chat 2018-12-22 20:28:51 Well, <@!304253531886583808> , someone made a fully functional hand, but I don't think it could grab things
creations-chat 2018-12-22 20:29:33 Wait a second, <@!304253531886583808> , if you can make it put on gloves or something, that might count for inventor of some sort
creations-chat 2018-12-22 20:30:20 I mean, there's no other bot that can equip stuff (And, for good reason for some)
creations-chat 2018-12-22 20:30:36 I know, I never said inventor was easy and right on the face of stuff
creations-chat 2018-12-22 20:31:20 I'd say equip it
bug-reports 2018-12-22 20:32:32 Wait, it is?
bug-reports 2018-12-22 20:32:48 You, crazy mad magician you
creations-chat 2018-12-22 20:33:53 ... What?
creations-chat 2018-12-22 20:34:10 VIP server
creations-chat 2018-12-22 20:36:16 Yeah, remember: Inventor is the hardest role to get, for a reason, and a very damn good reason
creations-chat 2018-12-22 20:49:37 More like space shuttle, but I'll double check
creations-chat 2018-12-22 20:50:03 Wait, you already have a superior rank
creations-chat 2018-12-22 20:50:22 Wait no nevermind, sorry
creations-chat 2018-12-22 20:50:48 The thing is, you can't get master and expert builder, because master completely encompasses expert builder's requirements
creations-chat 2018-12-22 20:50:54 That's what I thought was happening
creations-chat 2018-12-22 20:51:07 But double checking, master scientist is for rocket speed, and elon musk is for parts and landing it
creations-chat 2018-12-22 20:56:15 It can't use lift or propulsion as it's primary form of lift, only helium
creations-chat 2018-12-22 20:56:41 By technicalities this would count, as I actually made enough of the blocks helium that it mostly floats, although I'm not counting it
creations-chat 2018-12-22 20:57:05 Main reason I'm not counting it: The main wing
the-dump 2018-12-22 20:57:20 ... None of that please
creations-chat 2018-12-22 20:57:42 So, no wings, rockets for control, and only about 1 or 2 engines for altitude control, rather than a ton for lift?
creations-chat 2018-12-22 20:58:06 You get the point
creations-chat 2018-12-22 20:58:34 Alright, show me a picture of it?
creations-chat 2018-12-22 20:59:06 Er, flying if you'd please
creations-chat 2018-12-22 21:01:57 Alright then, part count?
creations-chat 2018-12-22 21:03:58 Nobody's made a functioning calculator period
creations-chat 2018-12-22 21:04:20 It'll need to do a variety of calculations with at least 2 digits, and be accurate
creations-chat 2018-12-22 21:04:31 So 9+9=18, 20+20= 40, and so on
creations-chat 2018-12-22 21:04:39 It can't just have a preset amount, otherwise that's just a demonstration
creations-chat 2018-12-22 21:04:58 Er, well, just as an example
creations-chat 2018-12-22 21:11:14 Oh yeah, Ignacioel, contests
creations-chat 2018-12-22 22:36:11 Then how about you try making one Xeilot?
creations-chat 2018-12-22 22:37:03 It's the closest thing I've seen so far, yes it's not a calculator, but unless someone comes up with something better, it's the best we're going to get
creations-chat 2018-12-22 22:38:40 Alright then, if you fail, then what happens?
creations-chat 2018-12-22 22:39:45 Should I just erase it Ignacioel?
creations-chat 2018-12-22 22:40:01 Meh, alright, it's your call in the end, so
creations-chat 2018-12-22 23:57:24 I wonder, next time Rick's available, let's ask about how readily available wiring could work, I can see what needs to happen
creations-chat 2018-12-22 23:58:40 All you need is a block that can take varrying amounts of inputs, including opposite inputs (such as if you want it off), and have that same block relay varrying amounts of outputs with opposite outputs, I think
creations-chat 2018-12-22 23:59:10 I might be HORRIBLY wrong on this, so forgive me on that, but I think that's all that it'd need to work
creations-chat 2018-12-22 23:59:51 Hell, once we add sensors and wiring, we can basically make or automate nearly anything
creations-chat 2018-12-23 02:28:57 I'll erase them for you, just post the first picture with the text, then go one at a time if you don't mind
creations-chat 2018-12-23 02:29:18 Or, re-post the last 3 pictures
creations-chat 2018-12-23 02:30:17 There we go, take a look

creations-chat 2018-12-23 03:19:30 That's not that hard, but cool
creations-chat 2018-12-23 03:21:10 It looks not half bad
creations-chat 2018-12-23 03:35:33 Up to you
creations-chat 2018-12-23 03:51:08 There's like a billion of those things believe it or not
creations-chat 2018-12-23 03:51:12 They're called warp drives
creations-chat 2018-12-23 03:51:19 And they make absurd levels of speed
creations-chat 2018-12-23 03:51:31 <@!421848903361757184> , that's why we warn people for engine spam of any sort
creations-chat 2018-12-23 04:02:16 This is why you don't spam engines
help 2018-12-23 04:06:58 Just DM the picture to me
help 2018-12-23 04:25:49 Like 1 or 1.5 seconds after they explode
the-dump 2018-12-23 21:17:47 .............
help 2018-12-23 21:44:14 <#491710474786832394> , you need a rank to do so however
help 2018-12-23 21:44:33 The main reason is because we've had a few, issues, with new people suggesting the same thing multiple times over to absurdity
the-dump 2018-12-24 00:07:33 As long as it abides to the rules
the-dump 2018-12-24 00:08:21 Sound warning next time?
creations-chat 2018-12-24 03:19:35 I saw it before
creations-chat 2018-12-24 03:20:04 Replicator you need upvotes for
creations-chat 2018-12-24 03:20:10 But technician you definitely got
help 2018-12-24 21:03:18 Yes
help 2018-12-25 00:02:58 Magnets repel anything that they're pointed at, soooo
creations-chat 2018-12-25 01:33:21 Looks pretty nice
creations-chat 2018-12-25 01:35:50 I mean, the scifi department needs more love to be honest, everyone's just replicating crud
creations-chat 2018-12-25 01:39:31 Yeup
creations-chat 2018-12-25 01:39:48 Scifi appreciation time
creations-chat 2018-12-25 01:40:03 
creations-chat 2018-12-25 01:40:17 
creations-chat 2018-12-25 01:40:33 Yes I am deleting them off of <#384025409945337856> because I already posted them there before, what do you think
creations-chat 2018-12-25 01:41:44 Yeah, there's honestly little love for original designs to be perfectly honest
creations-chat 2018-12-25 01:42:45 Trust me, I make stuff ludicrously functional, like, "Has to at least be able to maneuver combat-worthily" levels of functionality
creations-chat 2018-12-25 01:43:06 HAH! Helium, I only used it on one creation, the Stiletto, the middle one, and that's because I wanted to make a zero gravity fighter
creations-chat 2018-12-25 01:43:21 Same here
creations-chat 2018-12-25 01:43:46 Think of it as negative mass
creations-chat 2018-12-25 01:43:53 Also, wing spam and a very good design Imperial
creations-chat 2018-12-25 01:47:30 <#519624169730605086>
help 2018-12-25 17:55:30 You're sitting in one of the seats, duh
the-dump 2018-12-26 03:11:47 ........... Seriously?
help 2018-12-28 20:21:07 Jet spamming causes lag, more lag than block spam, less lag than another kind of spam which I won't say, but it's not allowed, as it's unoriginal, requires little to no effort, and is a malicious act against other users
help 2018-12-28 20:22:38 Just post pictures of them and we'll take actions when we can (Mad for some reason doesn't like moderation since he's worried that we'll go out of control with it)
help 2018-12-28 20:23:15 So, 500+ means at least 500 blocks
help 2018-12-28 20:24:44 Tell him "Message from a mod, JamesonMdrago, that action is bannable, and you will be banned if you do not cut it out now"
help 2018-12-28 20:25:11 (Currently that's a bluff, but don't tell him that, I've spooked people enough to stop them building bad things before with bluffs)
help 2018-12-28 20:25:38 Don't copy the second part of course
help 2018-12-28 20:26:13 RIP
help 2018-12-28 21:48:38 First of all, set them to auto controls and see which directions they go
You want them to be as far away from the center of mass as possible, with their respective movement, so you want pitch panels near the front and back, yaw near the top and bottom, and roll near the wing tips
help 2018-12-28 21:49:22 Demonstrating with my Wyvern fighter, the control panels near the edge of the wings are roll, while the ones near the front are for pitch, the tail (which you can't see), is entirely dedicated to yaw
help 2018-12-28 21:52:53 Control panels also work better at higher speeds
help 2018-12-28 21:58:27 It actually doesn't
help 2018-12-28 21:58:51 Only wing panels mimic any sort of aerodynamics, and even then it's moreso a "go fast, create upwards force" thing
help 2018-12-28 22:00:05 The slightest amount of imbalancing will make it start tilting, and engines near the back (or bottom in this case), make it more susceptible to instabilities
help 2018-12-28 22:00:12 ... <@!476231567971188736> , no, that won't work
help 2018-12-28 22:00:27 This isn't Kerbal Space Program, blocks aren't affected by aerodynamics
help 2018-12-28 22:01:04 It's literally the imbalance on your central seat that's amplified by the vulnerability to instability
help 2018-12-28 22:01:47 ... <@!476231567971188736> , this is a **GAME**
help 2018-12-28 22:02:19 It's not a real life physics simulation, if you want that, the closest thing you're probably going to get is KSP
help 2018-12-28 22:03:27 You get the point, the only objects that are affected by aerodynamics are wings, and even then they only cause drag and lift when moving sufficiently fast enough
the-dump 2018-12-28 22:31:32 Try that again and see what happens <@456226577798135808> , rules still apply here
the-dump 2018-12-28 22:33:30 You are very, very lucky it's me, got it?
help 2018-12-28 23:54:03 Pitch (up/down), yaw (left/right) or roll (clock/counter)?
help 2018-12-29 00:03:29 You want a larger tail fin control surface, and have them as far infront or behind the center of mass as possible
help 2018-12-29 00:24:42 For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction
creations-chat 2018-12-29 00:57:48 It now says who posted what
creations-chat 2018-12-29 00:57:55 So, I think you can go out of order, they'll just look at the names
creations-chat 2018-12-29 00:58:01 There's 3 sets of skis, and 1 new wheel
creations-chat 2018-12-29 00:58:28 It's nice
creations-chat 2018-12-29 01:01:31 It's nice
help 2018-12-29 01:11:57 No Jelly, just post it and Rick will add them to a ban list
help 2018-12-29 01:12:23 Alright, it's ineffective anyways compared to other things they could be doing
help 2018-12-29 01:13:42 What do you need help with?
help 2018-12-29 01:14:39 Either lag, or it's too light
help 2018-12-29 01:16:18 Well, if you swing a hammer heavier than yourself, you're gonna be dragged by the hammer, so what do you think?
help 2018-12-29 01:16:54 What are ya talking about!? You already have it! (Spoilers, I gave it to you)
creations-chat 2018-12-29 17:44:46 Isn't that a tutorial plane?
help 2018-12-29 19:52:39 Can you not use .wmv files?

creations-chat 2018-12-30 04:38:59 You sure that's a submarine and not a fighter?
the-dump 2018-12-30 04:39:35 What, the actual, fuck? I actually feel sick from seeing that
the-dump 2018-12-30 04:39:44 <@377596437283995660> , do you mind deleting it and changing your PFP?
the-dump 2018-12-30 04:40:21 As I said, it's making me slightly sick, and it's, more than a bit disturbing
creations-chat 2018-12-30 04:40:32 Too much lift on the back
the-dump 2018-12-30 04:40:41 ... Just change it
the-dump 2018-12-30 04:41:13 I literally made a statement in <#490306593242611742> about requests to change PFPs, now can you PLEASE change it and quit trying to disturb people?
the-dump 2018-12-30 04:41:43 If you want my best explanation, there's an uncanny valley where human-like objects become, very, disgusting, disturbing, what have you, because they just don't look right
the-dump 2018-12-30 04:42:02 Effectively a point where it goes from "inhuman with human-like qualities" to "an imperfect human"
the-dump 2018-12-30 04:42:38 .... <@377596437283995660> , change your PFP and delete the images
the-dump 2018-12-30 04:43:23 Thank you, it's just, it might just be because of today, but it's really hard to make me sick with stuff
help 2018-12-30 04:47:59 Don't freaking try to ping people, that just pisses off huge servers, hence why we have it disabled
help 2018-12-30 04:48:19 There's a thing called blacklisting you know
creations-chat 2018-12-30 05:50:05 That's called a well designed fighter
creations-chat 2018-12-30 05:50:19 Here's my flying sub
creations-chat 2018-12-30 05:50:31 And as you can see, it's stupidly durable (It can fight like this by the way)
creations-chat 2018-12-30 05:59:08 For prop master, you need to use no engines
creations-chat 2018-12-30 06:00:56 Well, if the tail engines are unnecessary, and are only for show, you can just knock them off and get prop master
help 2018-12-30 06:01:14 Wat?
help 2018-12-30 06:01:18 What are ya talking about?
help 2018-12-30 06:01:35 You already have it! (Jokes aside, we forgot to give it to ya, whops)
help 2018-12-30 06:02:00 You know the drill, don't suggest anything stupid, always check the pins, don't spam down recent stuff, yada yada
creations-chat 2018-12-30 06:02:15 Use ice blocks, they help a bit
creations-chat 2018-12-30 06:02:20 Offset should be even better
creations-chat 2018-12-30 06:02:40 Lower friction
creations-chat 2018-12-30 06:53:32 Hey, people can make what they want, although admittedly most people make the B rather than the A
the-dump 2018-12-30 18:25:45 Well, try to hold back on spam, but as long as it follows the rules
creations-chat 2018-12-30 18:46:14 You don't need to post the rest of it if it's one of the latter velocity ranks, only the fact that you achieved it
creations-chat 2018-12-30 18:46:42 From orbital velocity onwards, you only need to achieve the speed, the method upon which you do so does not matter
creations-chat 2018-12-30 18:50:45 Plane launcher? You mean catapult system?
creations-chat 2018-12-30 18:55:29 RIP, just post the blue part

creations-chat 2018-12-30 18:57:04 Magnets are slightly more complex, but they're easy to read once you get the hang of it
creations-chat 2018-12-30 18:57:20 They attract or repel every single block that their red face is pointed towards
creations-chat 2018-12-30 18:57:30 ?
creations-chat 2018-12-30 19:20:53 Huh, never saw that kind of folding
creations-chat 2018-12-30 19:21:17 He must've set it to auto
creations-chat 2018-12-30 19:21:50 Auto control surfaces adjust to whichever orientation they're placed at
creations-chat 2018-12-30 19:22:06 I'm willing to bet that's what happened actually
creations-chat 2018-12-30 19:22:33 We know, but does it fly well?
creations-chat 2018-12-30 19:24:47 I mean, to be fair, why do we need to make these crazy contraptions on our planes? Because we're Plane Crazy (Don't shoot me for the joke)

help 2019-01-26 03:04:42 What you're likely lacking is pitch, control panels will automatically roll you and start both yawing and pitching with the movement of the mouse
help 2019-01-26 03:05:06 However, if you want the best performance, although it is far less precise and doesn't auto-stabilize, I'd suggest using keyboard controls
help 2019-01-26 03:05:40 If you want automatic however, add control surfaces to the front and back, that'll give you more pitch, add more to the edges of your current wing to get roll, and add some vertical ones to the front or back to get yaw
help 2019-01-26 03:06:13 For reference
Pitch: Up/down
Yaw: Left/right
Roll: Clockwise/counter
help 2019-01-26 03:07:04 Not a problem, if you don't mind complex controls, manual keybinds are your best friend, as they add far more precision
help 2019-01-26 03:08:11 While with automatic controls, control surfaces will only go halfway on roll or pitch to satisfy their needs, manual keybinds will allow you to dedicate them entirely to either roll, pitch or yaw
help 2019-01-26 03:08:38 And since the further away from their respective plane, they're at, the better, doing so will let you do crazy maneuvers
help 2019-01-26 03:09:05 They also allow you to add engines to assist your turns, which can lead to even further maneuvers, to the point of absurdity sometimes
help 2019-01-26 03:13:07 Manual or auto controls?
help 2019-01-26 03:13:47 Add more control surfaces to the left, right, top or bottom side of the center of mass
help 2019-01-26 03:13:53 As far away as you can infact

help 2019-01-26 03:18:33 The ones farthest to the left and right should be for manual roll, the inner ones should be for pitch

help 2019-02-02 22:49:32 "thelegandarychicken", he's copying other people's creations and avoiding any and all moderation
help 2019-02-02 23:01:51 I think I finally got through to that dumbass, he finally caught on after I threatened to ban him from the game permanently, and he stood his ground, pulling out pathetic excuses like this
help 2019-02-02 23:02:26 I warned him that it was a permanent ban that covered both IP and VPNs, so alts wouldn't work, and I doubt he got the memo, but it's the best we can do

creations-chat 2019-02-03 05:32:30 Ah, nosecone, best you can do is use long wedges at the base, followed by shorter ones, maybe inverted ones if you've got that much room to spare, before putting a pyramid ontop or leaving it flat
creations-chat 2019-02-03 05:33:09 Ehhhhhh, my internet's screwed up, sorry
creations-chat 2019-02-03 05:33:39 Try using 1X4 wedges, then 1X2 and 1X1, if you need to shave it down, 1X2 and 1X1
creations-chat 2019-02-03 05:34:05 Then start with the cockpit first, that's what I did
creations-chat 2019-02-03 05:34:32 Design the cockpit, and you can get a good size reference for the rest of it
creations-chat 2019-02-03 05:35:23 Try utilizing half wedges, and making your cockpit out of solid materials instead of glass
creations-chat 2019-02-03 05:36:03 Dunno what to say then
help 2019-02-03 17:59:05 Yes?

help 2019-02-06 06:22:14 <@!329303436300386306> , did you actually bother reading the rules? You don't have to mass ping unless it's an emergency, like the entire server's burning down
help 2019-02-06 06:23:56 That's not exploiting, that's modifying a vehicle to attempt to troll others' vehicles, use blacklist, and if you want to fight their vehicle, spam blacklist on and off repeatedly
help 2019-02-06 06:24:54 .... The hell are you even on? No offense, but Robloxian figures have next to ZERO mass compared to even a single block, so what exactly are you on to think that that could possibly happen?
help 2019-02-06 06:25:56 ..... Excuse me, but I need to ask a few things
help 2019-02-06 06:26:37 1: Are you over 13 years old? Due to Discord Terms of Service, we must, by the law, ask you to leave if you are under 13 years old without parental permission to be on this site
2: Did you even pay attention to the wheels?
3: Even if it was an exploiter, unless he's specifically walking over to your vehicle, why is it a problem?
help 2019-02-06 06:27:00 ... "Yup" to which parts?
help 2019-02-06 06:27:15 And you're sure of this?
help 2019-02-06 06:27:48 ... You're typing like you're well under 13 to be perfectly honest, making multiple incorrect statements with highly improper grammar in short burst statements
help 2019-02-06 06:29:25 It's literally past midnight over here, being tired doesn't mean you can't correct your statements, or at the very least have some grammatical correctness aside from just rolling your face on the keyboard (And forgive me if that sounded rude, I tend to get a bit pissy when I'm tired)
help 2019-02-06 06:30:56 Let me point you to section 5, with the important section underlined, and the area that was broken underlined twice
help 2019-02-06 06:31:34 .....
help 2019-02-06 06:32:03 We can and will force you out of the server if you break any of the rules, got it?
help 2019-02-06 06:33:01 We'll forward it to Rick for him to add the person to the banlist, but aside from that we cannot garuntee any action to be taken, especially since it seems so dubious, how so little mass can launch someone so far away with such force
help 2019-02-06 06:34:11 .... If you keep Blacklist turned on, he should clip through, and if it doesn't happen, then I don't know what to say
help 2019-02-06 06:34:17 We've literally had a guy try to do what you described, and the blacklist function worked on him
help 2019-02-06 06:34:28 Are you sure you aren't turning on "anti-copy blacklist" instead of blacklisting the specific person?
help 2019-02-06 06:35:52 If you've played the game for 2 years, then tell me at least 4 non-block parts we've had before the major update
help 2019-02-06 06:37:14 ..... Something tells me you're lying on a few fronts, wedges, beams and blocks don't count, how about that?
help 2019-02-06 06:39:27 ... Can't verify if you got the badge early or not, since you won't let me see your inventory, which makes it even more dubious
help 2019-02-06 06:40:14 That's your first straight lie
help 2019-02-06 06:41:00 I was gonna do a badge check to see just how early you got the badge, because you need to have gotten it extremely early in order to have been even remotely truthful, considering your particular join date
help 2019-02-06 06:43:53 ... Having the badge or no-

help 2019-02-06 06:47:19 It's a warn for attempting to lie to us, about a badge that has not been released yet
help 2019-02-06 06:47:55 I expect that image in 10 seconds from this post
help 2019-02-06 06:48:12 Time's up
help 2019-02-06 06:48:29 That's how long it took me to take the screenshot, crop the screen, upload it to Discord and send it here
help 2019-02-06 06:48:32 ......
help 2019-02-06 06:49:15 You were lying about owning both badges
help 2019-02-06 06:49:24 Spy, it shows when it was last updated, not when he got it
help 2019-02-06 06:50:11 See?
help 2019-02-06 06:50:43 As much as I will fucking seal club a troll or idiot into a twitching paste, I will defend anyone against unjust punishments, and punishing for that particular date is unjust
help 2019-02-06 06:51:13 However, punishing for lying about owning both badges, especially since it's a known fact that the second badge is impossible to legitimately obtain, and is infact not even coded into the game
help 2019-02-06 06:51:26 That's legitimate, don't lie to us
help 2019-02-06 06:52:22 You thought it was released, so you could lie to us, in a vague attempt to validate your statements, which wound up backfiring horribly on you ...
help 2019-02-06 06:53:02 .... I grouped up a warn and a ban into just a single warn you know, now quit acting like a god damn 5 year old piece of cancer
help 2019-02-06 06:53:33 That's not the point, just, look, read over the rules very thoroughly, rather than just gloss over them
help 2019-02-06 06:54:09 If you aren't breaking any of them, nor are you bugging anyone to an extreme, you are probably in the clear to do whatever you're thinking of doing
help 2019-02-06 06:54:38 However, if you break any rule, and bug people to extremes via mass pings or an annoying ignorance to what people are saying, then we will not hesitate to boot you from the server
help 2019-02-06 06:55:02 And as stern, unfair and brutal as that sounds, in practice, it's surprisingly gentile, now can you **PLEASE**, listen to that statement?
help 2019-02-06 06:56:15 And one last thing, even if the mod team seems like they're asleep, some of us decided to mark ourselves as offline, so you can't see them, that way any troublemakers get caught
help 2019-02-06 07:04:30 Look, I don't usually have to do these long, boring and stressful rants, but when someone lies to the mod team, multiple times, and mass pings the mod team, even though that's literally listed as something to not do within the rules, I have to, so do forgive me for this
help 2019-02-06 07:05:55 As I mentioned, he lied to the mod team multiple times in highly disprovable ways, and he mass pinged the mod team
help 2019-02-06 07:06:31 Infact he's lucky to be on the server, because we (or at least I) suspect he's under 13, and Discord Terms of Service legally obliges us to respectfully ask any and all people that are under 13 without parental permission to leave the server, and use force if we have to
help 2019-02-06 07:10:59 He claimed to own both badges before, which is an impossible thing, considering he's unable to earn the other one
help 2019-02-06 07:12:00 
help 2019-02-06 07:12:29 Even though you didn't know, it's still a false claim
help 2019-02-06 07:14:40 ....

help 2019-02-06 07:15:25 Rule 10, I literally told you to parse over the rules

help 2019-02-06 07:17:13 Fucking hell, we have these rules for a reason ....
help 2019-02-06 07:17:56 For the reason why I kicked him: "3 warns, 1 for mass pinging of mods that were online at the time, 1 for straight up lying to the mods, DragonMage style, and 1 for blatantly breaking rule 10, just because he could"
help 2019-02-06 07:19:07 ... Get out
help 2019-02-06 07:20:06 Look <@!268949543293288448> , don't break a rule infront of our faces, especially mine, I will break your face if you try that, got it?
help 2019-02-06 07:21:23 You aren't warned, it's just incase you get any funny thoughts, alright?
help 2019-02-06 07:21:33 Look, I'm pissed after that last guy thought he/she/it could break rules infront of my face
help 2019-02-06 07:21:59 ... Swearing is allowed so long as it's got a reason for it, such as someone provoking me
help 2019-02-06 07:23:12 You'd think common sense would dictate that
help 2019-02-06 07:27:49 ... I'll assume that's an insult directed at the other person, for your sake, yeah, we know, we have to deal with that alot
help 2019-02-06 07:28:08 And by alot, I mean, this is a Roblox server, and Roblox is a site practically legendary for it's toxicity
help 2019-02-06 07:28:17 What more do you want me to say?
help 2019-02-06 07:29:54 Oh don't get me started on this jeff, yes, claim you're head of a large server all you want, yes, claim you know the rules all you want, yes, claim you know what to deal with all you want, but until you directly put yourself in our shoes, which apparently you are incapable of doing, considering your view on us, please, don't comment on how __**WE**__ do things
help 2019-02-06 07:30:16 We don't do anything without a reason for doing so, got it?
help 2019-02-06 07:31:19 And it's self-detrimental to go against the general community, so why would we do that?
help 2019-02-06 07:33:47 Yes yes <@!268949543293288448> , we get it, just don't try to run us around unless you know directly what we have to deal with, got it?
help 2019-02-06 07:36:12 We get it Trump, now please just leave us be, we don't need to hear about the billions of people you had to take care of, if you want to prove it to us, try to help the moderation team and provide as much useful info as possible without minimodding, got it?
help 2019-02-06 07:36:41 And if I seem extremely pissed off, I'm tired, the last guy pissed me off, and I'm also stressed out, so please, start by making it easier for me somehow
help 2019-02-06 07:38:40 ... <@!268949543293288448> , Are you referring to me, or the person I just booted?
help 2019-02-06 07:39:52 Ah

creations-chat 2019-02-15 19:19:46 <@!510443055111733248> , own up, now, did you, or did you not copy off of trollgeinuous' craft?
creations-chat 2019-02-15 19:20:22 Integex, if I don't give people the opportunity to defend themselves, they start raging and ranting at me
creations-chat 2019-02-15 19:21:10 .... <@!510443055111733248> , it's got the same style all around, and even I'm noticing the small details, if you took inspiration, ask trollgeinuous if you can keep it, if he says yes, you won't get ranks for it, but you won't have that thing deleted either
creations-chat 2019-02-15 19:22:13 <@!510443055111733248> , even if that's different, the building style's exactly the same, down to the outer bracing style used
creations-chat 2019-02-15 19:23:00 If you admit it, or make major enough changes that it's easily differentiable from Trollgeinuous', you'll be let off, and I want proof that you made it massively, MASSIVELY different
creations-chat 2019-02-15 19:23:28 But until then, the exterior is literally the exact same as a portion of trollgeinuous' craft
creations-chat 2019-02-15 19:24:01 Freaking hell, it's even got some of the side circle panels in more or less the same pattern ...
creations-chat 2019-02-15 19:25:15 <@!510443055111733248> , look, I'm throwing you a god damn yacht to get out of the situation, just own up to it, whether it's inspiration or flat out copying, if the former, get Trollgeinuous' permission, if the latter, change it in ways to make it differentiable, and you'll be off the hook, either are very easy to do
creations-chat 2019-02-15 19:26:11 <@!454809803223465984> , speaking of which, DO you give him permission to copy it, and if so, to what degree?
creations-chat 2019-02-15 19:27:34 <@!510443055111733248> , Change your ship in a major and meaningful way, that includes at the very least the overall shape, outer design, and fine details, and you'll be off the hook, got it?

creations-chat 2019-02-15 19:36:17 <@!453981329902665740> , FFS, "common sense", do you honestly think it's a good idea to DM a thing to a mod of a server that doesn't allow NSFW, something that's potentially NSFW?
creations-chat 2019-02-15 19:36:36 Sorry, but you've had your "One chance" like 4-5 chances ago
creations-chat 2019-02-15 19:37:51 "Multiple instances of NSFW and inappropriate instances, and ruining your "last chance" many, many, MANY times over"
creations-chat 2019-02-15 19:38:03 Seems like a good reason that he/she/it will get?
creations-chat 2019-02-15 19:38:46 <@!510443055111733248> , Don't just cut out a giant gaping hole, get rid of the main fuselage, the part that looks like Troll's craft
creations-chat 2019-02-15 19:39:29 Voxel owns the server, so
creations-chat 2019-02-15 19:40:12 <@!510443055111733248> , How much DID you delete though? Delete the thing that looks like trollgeinuous' craft and we'll be satisfied, because we have a ZERO tolerance for unauthorized copying
creations-chat 2019-02-15 19:40:27 <@!454809803223465984> , The other guy was banned for posting NSFW multiple times and always requesting a last chance
creations-chat 2019-02-15 19:41:24 ........ I have my reasons for doing so <@!263959626804887552> , don't question it
creations-chat 2019-02-15 19:41:44 Nino, show a screenshot of the ENTIRELY ALTERED BUILD, and we'll let troll be the final judge
creations-chat 2019-02-15 19:43:44 And by the way <@!510443055111733248> , here's the thing, people will notice if you've kept the original copied creation against our orders, a lot of people in the Discord server loiter around public servers, so basically there's at least 1 per public server due to how Roblox spreads them out, and they WILL report you for having copied Troll's creation, since it's so iconic, and if we figure out you haven't adjusted your craft properly, you WILL, at minimal, have your creation deleted for not cooperating, and at most, you WILL be banned from both the game and the Discord server for being an uncreative leech upon us
creations-chat 2019-02-15 19:44:25 ..............
creations-chat 2019-02-15 19:44:46 Giving him the benifit of the doubt, I don't think he's english
creations-chat 2019-02-15 19:44:53 Troll, do you think his "changes" were enough?
creations-chat 2019-02-15 19:45:25 <@511080180966752256> , Trollgeinuous is the one that owns the craft, it's up to him to say if Nino altered it enough or not
creations-chat 2019-02-15 19:46:52 Fixed
creations-chat 2019-02-15 19:47:17 I'd say VIP server 2
creations-chat 2019-02-15 19:48:18 <@!510443055111733248> , You have 10 minutes to be there before I have to make a definite decision as to whether call Rick to ban you or not, better make a very solid case either as to why you should keep it, or adjust it in a way so it's easily distinguishable
creations-chat 2019-02-15 19:48:35 Wait, you sure Troll? You're using the links Mee6 gave, right?
creations-chat 2019-02-15 19:49:00 Fixed already by the way
creations-chat 2019-02-15 19:49:23 It's up to Voxel to do so, and I think it's because Gyazo's the easiest way to post things for some people
creations-chat 2019-02-15 19:49:37 VIP server 2, as given by the Mee6 bot
creations-chat 2019-02-15 19:50:15 Use the links Mee6 gives you

creations-chat 2019-02-15 19:55:53 The craft in question, do note that he does NOT have permission from Trollgeinuous to copy the main fuselage
creations-chat 2019-02-15 19:56:25 Pictures, duh
creations-chat 2019-02-15 19:57:56 ... I'll DM him about it

the-dump 2019-02-28 04:06:29 Excuse me?
the-dump 2019-02-28 04:09:11 ..... <@456226577798135808>
the-dump 2019-02-28 04:09:46 Don't try that again
the-dump 2019-02-28 04:09:54 I am not in the mood for it
the-dump 2019-02-28 04:10:15 Yeah and my fucking ass is SFW, but I don't post pictures or GIF of that now do I?
the-dump 2019-02-28 04:10:37 You didn't get the point ...
the-dump 2019-02-28 04:11:29 .........
the-dump 2019-02-28 04:11:37 <@!350241258012278784> , are you honestly serious?
the-dump 2019-02-28 04:11:52 Look, muffin, there's KIDS here for fuck's sake
the-dump 2019-02-28 04:12:11 Don't screw up their minds or anything or so help me I'm going to break your face (Less metaphorically than normal)
the-dump 2019-02-28 04:12:54 ......
the-dump 2019-02-28 04:13:57 <@!350241258012278784> , stay out of it
the-dump 2019-02-28 04:14:44 Muffin, just what's the problem with following the rules exactly?
the-dump 2019-02-28 04:15:02 You fucking broke rule 2 ...
the-dump 2019-02-28 04:15:18 That's rule number 2, pretty much THE highest easily enforcable rule we have
the-dump 2019-02-28 04:15:31 And how exactly did I break rule 2?
the-dump 2019-02-28 04:16:22 ..................................
the-dump 2019-02-28 04:17:08 <@456226577798135808> , That particular logic is so flawed that it's a level at which I can only describe as "an egocentric, narcissistic, "world orbits around me"" behavior
the-dump 2019-02-28 04:53:52 Quit posting people's faces, if it's a meme, nobody gets it, and it could be very uncomfortable for some people
the-dump 2019-02-28 04:57:51 Just, don't, I'm deleting them for a reason
the-dump 2019-02-28 05:06:51 Just, whatever, I'll shout at you if it's not good
the-dump 2019-02-28 05:10:54 Denied, it's really creepy
the-dump 2019-02-28 05:11:03 Like seriously, even I got shivers from that, and I've seen lots of shit
the-dump 2019-02-28 05:15:41 What is it with you and posting selfies of black people or seriously obese white people!?
the-dump 2019-02-28 05:16:43 Just because the rules say you can doesn't mean it isn't highly frowned upon ...
the-dump 2019-02-28 05:18:14 .............................................. No offense but I'm genuinely getting sick of you and your general attitude, you seem to be treating this server like a "Post all the actual shit" server
the-dump 2019-02-28 05:21:03 .......
the-dump 2019-02-28 05:21:06 ?warnings <@377596437283995660>
the-dump 2019-02-28 05:21:11 You're one to talk ...
the-dump 2019-02-28 05:21:28 Because it was inappropriate
the-dump 2019-02-28 05:23:34 Ravin, I don't give two damns if it's borderline or straight up inappropriate, I'm going to treat it as inappropriate, because people kept on fucking posting borderline shit until the entire server revolted against him
the-dump 2019-02-28 05:25:29 ............. Guys, just cut it out
the-dump 2019-02-28 05:26:26 I am not in the mood for this for fuck's sake, and I'm very tired of uuyy posting random black people picture as if he was making a god damn hitlist or something, now can you please just cut it out? Posting random pictures without any purpose whatsoever is basically spam
the-dump 2019-02-28 05:27:39 If you just spammed it randomly, yes, but if you actually gave it SOME form of purpose, no
the-dump 2019-02-28 05:28:01 uuyy was literally just posting random selfies without any **PURPOSE** whatsoever, other than just for posting them
the-dump 2019-02-28 05:29:05 Spam: The massive overabundance of some form of information, with little actual use or reason behind it
the-dump 2019-02-28 05:29:13 And yeah, THOSE are fine, they're meant to be funny
the-dump 2019-02-28 05:29:20 How the fuck is a face funny though?
the-dump 2019-02-28 05:30:41 It has to have SOME purpose
the-dump 2019-02-28 05:31:20 Let me ask you this: Does a random face of some random guy we've never seen before, not doing anything, have any purpose?
the-dump 2019-02-28 05:31:49 Hell, imagine a mugshot or a photo ID, without everything else, a blank or uninteresting background, what purpose does it serve?
the-dump 2019-02-28 05:31:51 ...............
the-dump 2019-02-28 05:31:57 <@!350241258012278784> , how?
the-dump 2019-02-28 05:32:10 Legitimately, how? Do you find the Mona Lisa funny then?
the-dump 2019-02-28 05:33:19 There was a good example of a funny face picture earlier, although I'm not gonna bother to find it, TL;DR on it though, basically it was someone mocking up a beach selfie, and a picture of what he was doing taken by someone else
the-dump 2019-02-28 05:33:23 .... Nope
the-dump 2019-02-28 05:35:47 Uhhhh, <@!350773590213525511> , Delete that if you don't mind
the-dump 2019-02-28 05:35:58 I know it's from the Madagascar movie thing, but, uhhhh
the-dump 2019-02-28 05:36:10 Ehhhh, I'll give you a very soft pass
the-dump 2019-02-28 05:36:38 It was nudging rule 2, sorry
the-dump 2019-02-28 05:37:07 Look, things are freaking complicated, you try managing this for more than 10 minutes and see how it goes
the-dump 2019-02-28 05:37:12 Also, why <@459620345536577547> ?
the-dump 2019-02-28 05:37:26 It wasn't NSFW, but it was pushing it
the-dump 2019-02-28 05:37:52 I got it curly, and while it wasn't quite breaking rule 2, I'd rather be better safe than sorry
the-dump 2019-02-28 05:38:43 You can
the-dump 2019-02-28 05:38:55 And <@377596437283995660> , We're handcuffed by both Discord and Roblox at the same time
the-dump 2019-02-28 05:39:13 ...... -Facedesk- please don't wofd, I'm dissapointed in that part of the community
the-dump 2019-02-28 05:39:32 And if someone on Roblox decides to bug us about this server, we're going to have to shut the entire thing down
the-dump 2019-02-28 05:39:58 <@!350241258012278784> , no, but unless it has a purpose, which, Imperial saved you from that, I'm gonna count it as spam
the-dump 2019-02-28 05:40:18 The only problem I have is the coloration and tail <@459620345536577547> , otherwise, meh
the-dump 2019-02-28 05:40:37 <@377596437283995660> , there are PLENTY of euphemisms in old movies that are rated PG, sooo
the-dump 2019-02-28 05:41:13 .... <@377596437283995660> , don't blame us
the-dump 2019-02-28 05:42:38 .........
the-dump 2019-02-28 05:42:48 <@!350241258012278784> , Did you pay attention to what I typed out?
the-dump 2019-02-28 05:43:07 I literally just said "<@377596437283995660> , there are PLENTY of euphemisms in old movies that are rated PG, sooo" (Sorry for the ping Ravin)
the-dump 2019-02-28 05:43:51 Okay I'm taking a temporary health break
the-dump 2019-02-28 05:43:56 Uhhhhh
the-dump 2019-02-28 05:44:03 <@!350773590213525511> Please tell me that's not what I think it is
the-dump 2019-02-28 05:44:35 Oh holy f-
the-dump 2019-02-28 05:44:39 They actually are, holy shit
the-dump 2019-02-28 05:44:45 Or, wait
the-dump 2019-02-28 05:45:10 Yeah no, you can tell by the "posture" and 2nd row from left, closest to camera
the-dump 2019-02-28 05:45:29 That looks like it's from Sky Rogue or something
the-dump 2019-02-28 05:46:07 Pretty sure Imperial's joking, judging from the typing and capitalization pattern
the-dump 2019-02-28 05:46:37 Don't quote me on this, but if he was serious, he'd type seriously, and not bolden anything like that
the-dump 2019-02-28 05:46:42 Uhhhh
the-dump 2019-02-28 05:46:49 Wofd, I'm gonna, uhhh
the-dump 2019-02-28 05:46:57 Yeaaaahhhhhh
the-dump 2019-02-28 05:48:05 Okay, I'm gonna leave it to you Imperial, also <@!350773590213525511> , both would've been fine with context, hell, they might even be fine in <#384021699466756107> at the right time, did you SEE what just happened there?
the-dump 2019-02-28 05:48:59 TL;DR, people spammed out various memes that could reference a sort of "I saw that!", and then memes of banning stuff
the-dump 2019-02-28 05:49:15 It did actually match the context, so it was allowed
the-dump 2019-02-28 05:49:33 I mean, that's why crab rave plays every time we ban someone
the-dump 2019-02-28 05:50:53 I'm leaving you with this Imperial, I need a bit of a mental health time
the-dump 2019-02-28 05:52:00 .... <@!350241258012278784> , Justify the context
the-dump 2019-02-28 05:52:41 ........... Imperial, you take over then, but seriously, it's literally fucking up my nerves at this point
the-dump 2019-02-28 20:43:14 And who are you exactly?
the-dump 2019-02-28 20:48:52 .... <@251113404645900289> , Who exactly are you?
the-dump 2019-02-28 21:00:04 Okay? I can't even find ROLve ...
the-dump 2019-02-28 21:02:27 Oh thaaaaat one, yeah, after a run-in with alot of stuff, no offense but I don't really have respect for ROLve anymore
the-dump 2019-02-28 21:04:38 Look, after I've witnessed alot of shit, what am I supposed to say? I literally saw one collaborating with a fly hacker on Typical Colors, and I mean a particularly abusive fly hacker to ...
the-dump 2019-02-28 21:05:56 Typical Colors is one of their games, and I've seen so many things that I've stopped believing in their moderation team
the-dump 2019-02-28 21:07:06 __**Collaborating**__ with one
the-dump 2019-02-28 21:09:30 Maybe not Rytim exactly, but it was someone who was kicking anyone who questioned it
the-dump 2019-02-28 21:09:47 One reverse-lookup later, turns out they're a mod
the-dump 2019-02-28 22:14:28 Is that a caique?
the-dump 2019-02-28 23:42:31 <@456226577798135808> , I'm a fan of birds, and I freaking want a caique, they're adorable
the-dump 2019-02-28 23:57:23 Sounds pretty cool
the-dump 2019-03-01 21:20:13 <@251113404645900289> Oh that's very believable "ex-moderator from mano and newhaven"
the-dump 2019-03-01 21:20:46 Looking back at the chat history, I seriously doubt that you were a moderator for anything
the-dump 2019-03-01 21:22:24 Your behavior doesn't reflect it at all, again
the-dump 2019-03-01 21:24:47 Plus I can literally just do this in 10 seconds (I left the white space there intentionally because I couldn't be fucked to open photoshop, so I just used paint)
the-dump 2019-03-01 21:25:18 In the modern day era, screenshots aren't exactly that believable to be fully honest
the-dump 2019-03-01 21:25:41 I mean, it's to get the point across simply put
the-dump 2019-03-01 21:29:37 Because although that person was in the right as per the written rules, and even though I could've exerted rule 11 on them, I keep on trying to be nice and explain it, hence why there's so many people in the server, because even if they break rules, they don't learn if you break their faces in exchange
the-dump 2019-03-01 21:29:50 We're leaving Voxel and rick to prep it, likely they're discussing it
the-dump 2019-03-01 21:30:06 Madattak's against in-game moderation, 99% unlikely to happen
the-dump 2019-03-01 21:31:12 How exactly is in-game moderation, headed by a highly trusted team, inefficient?
the-dump 2019-03-01 21:31:17 I put that in quotes for a damn reason ...
the-dump 2019-03-01 21:32:00 ... How, exactly, is it faster?
the-dump 2019-03-01 21:33:16 .... Rytim, I'm going to stop you right there, that's saying you can interface it so you can externally delete someone's creation, and if they continue, ban them, while I've seen the latter take effect (Albeit while causing lag in the few games that I have played it where the dev confirmed it), the former doesn't seem fesable
the-dump 2019-03-01 21:33:18 ...........
the-dump 2019-03-01 21:33:31 You literally just agreed with us, but you're trying to fight with our statements
the-dump 2019-03-01 21:34:04 And how is that any different from in-game admins?
the-dump 2019-03-01 21:34:28 Well, technically <#495286269459300364> 's open for anything, so, why not I guess? More convenient to condense it in one channel than to flood it over to another
the-dump 2019-03-01 21:35:06 Rytim, you're saying the problem's an issue with tools, that's not the problem, the problem's an issue with manpower, not enough people HAVE the tools
the-dump 2019-03-01 21:35:55 To make a metaphor on this, it doesn't matter how many guns you have, if only one person's allowed to wield them, you've still only got one soldier
the-dump 2019-03-01 21:36:05 ...... Rytim
the-dump 2019-03-01 21:36:22 Listen to what we're typing for once
the-dump 2019-03-01 21:36:33 Also, are you talking about people in the Discord server, or in-game?
the-dump 2019-03-01 21:36:49 .................
the-dump 2019-03-01 21:37:32 Rytimiscurisin, you're literally repeating what I'm typing out, but claiming it as your own, and you're literally ignoring statements when I keep on saying why that's difficult, if not impossible to do
the-dump 2019-03-01 21:38:46 I saw it on Noob vs Zombie Realish, but that particular system caused not only lag problems, but was highly inconsistent
the-dump 2019-03-01 21:39:37 
help 2019-03-01 21:40:09 Disable RGB colors in the settings, overwrite older builds, use more beams than blocks
the-dump 2019-03-01 21:41:15 Then why don't you show us?
the-dump 2019-03-01 21:41:57 Then don't claim it unless you know it well enough or have previous evidence from another person to prove it
the-dump 2019-03-01 21:43:37 As far as I can tell, it's still going because Rytim doesn't seem to understand that we're talking about the same thing, and he simply keeps on trying to needlessly push his point, while remaining blissfully ignorant as to other people's experiences and mentions of the same thing, even when they contradict or nullify his points to various degrees
the-dump 2019-03-01 21:44:02 Right, let me be blunt, the bottleneck, isn't, the tools, we have enough tools to detect people causing problems
the-dump 2019-03-01 21:44:40 What our bottleneck is are the actual people to respond to these problems, and no bot is trained enough to detect the difference between a plane and a flying, you know, in the current state, so we will need trusted manpower
the-dump 2019-03-01 21:45:17 ... "the bottleneck, isn't, the tools", maybe try listening for once instead of blabbing on needlessly to yourself as if you're the only one that can be correct
the-dump 2019-03-01 21:45:44 What CAN the third party system do that our current Plane Crazy Discord population can't do exactly?
the-dump 2019-03-01 21:46:44 Faster than instantaneous? Oh I'll "believe that", while also believing that a fucking rainbow unicorn's vomiting on my face, oh wait, that's not happening
the-dump 2019-03-01 21:46:53 I'm telling you, you're trying to fix a problem that doesn't exist
the-dump 2019-03-01 21:47:28 .... That's not what I said at all, what I'm saying is we need more manpower to enforce in-game moderation better, we don't need more tools
the-dump 2019-03-01 21:47:52 Fonkl, I don't think that's possible, at least not without designing the game from the ground-up to support it in the first place
the-dump 2019-03-01 21:48:33 .................... Alright then, I suppose I'll take the advice now then
the-dump 2019-03-01 21:49:35 Here's my reason: "I think we've all had enough of your sheer ignorance to everyone's communication towards you" for 10 minutes
the-dump 2019-03-01 21:50:23 Ahehem, pay attention to the last part that's outside of the quotes
the-dump 2019-03-01 21:51:19 Here have a random bird being spray washed https://twitter.com/birbb/status/1062158605661691906
the-dump 2019-03-01 21:59:02 It's "Swiss army nails" I think
the-dump 2019-03-01 22:15:37 If it follows the rules, yes, but please be thorough with rule 2 and 11
the-dump 2019-03-01 22:20:30 Yeah no I'm not allowing that (Picture's already deleted)
the-dump 2019-03-01 22:26:32 ......... I can see the pants, and I can see he's a guy, so I'll leave you be Grab

the-dump 2019-03-01 22:44:33 Uhhhh, <@!340543153922768906> , I'm gonna delete that last one
help 2019-03-02 01:27:23 It saves quite a bit of space on colored creations, but remember, they will default to a pre-set Roblox color palette, which means their color could be vastly different compared to before

creations-chat 2019-03-08 01:42:31 It's not a specifically stated rule, but I will file it under rule 11, on the account of not only is it very childish, spiteful and scummy, but it's also the complete opposite way to gain any meaningful followers

bug-reports 2019-03-09 03:58:16 Sorry, this is just the BILLIONTH time someone complained about everything being broken ...
bug-reports 2019-03-09 04:01:27 ..... <@!228115104061849612> , read the stuff right above what you just typed
bug-reports 2019-03-09 04:02:41 I don't know, by actually bothering to look around at more than just your ass? Rick literally stated it in <#490306593242611742> with a ping to everyone
bug-reports 2019-03-09 04:03:03 That's what I think is the most annoying part, Rick even pinged people about it and nobody notices it
bug-reports 2019-03-09 04:04:17 And yet you've read the rules, which states the purpose of each channel, or supposedly you did ...
bug-reports 2019-03-09 04:05:12 .......................................... Read them again
bug-reports 2019-03-09 04:06:09 We're aware of that, thanks anyways though
creations-chat 2019-03-09 04:16:14 The + icon to the left of the textbox you're typing in
creations-chat 2019-03-09 04:24:35 Please don't use .wmvs, convert it through something
creations-chat 2019-03-09 04:24:39 .wmv files can house viruses
creations-chat 2019-03-09 04:26:36 There's Roblox instructions on how to do so, Google, and worst comes to worst, use some sort of converter to convert it to a GIF or something
creations-chat 2019-03-09 23:56:01 Except flying vehicles
creations-chat 2019-03-09 23:58:37 It, actually isn't that strong
the-dump 2019-03-10 00:22:32 <@!360925918081974272> , the top and bottom ones of that bunch were inappropriate, middle one's fine though
the-dump 2019-03-10 00:22:43 No euphemisms and no jokes about suicide please
creations-chat 2019-03-10 02:51:19 Uhhhh, hmmmm, try <#478584971670454284> , since <#550286359064084480> is still under maintenance (And cleaning of mods fooling around)
help 2019-03-10 02:52:31 You have my written/typed permission to do so as long as it's not NSFW, although if it is, uhhh, it's a bit of a sensitive topic
help 2019-03-10 02:53:42 N.S.F.W: Not Safe For Work, basically anything that's highly inappropriate, you wouldn't show to anyone in public
help 2019-03-10 02:54:02 (Yes there is a running joke of "NSFW" being a person in an office standing on a chair, but still)
help 2019-03-10 02:54:06 My DMs are always open
creations-chat 2019-03-10 03:10:21 All pilot roles were from a previous iteration, if you didn't get them then, you won't get them now
creations-chat 2019-03-10 03:29:20 I mean, the thing about the naming system is, it picks up your Roblox profile name
creations-chat 2019-03-10 03:29:26 So it's synched up to the one on Roblox
creations-chat 2019-03-10 03:29:41 For example: If you search up my Discord name on Roblox, you'll find my account
creations-chat 2019-03-16 00:11:49 Colonel, please, unless you have some constructive criticism, try to be nice, unless it's JUST that bad
creations-chat 2019-03-16 00:12:49 I mean, you typed it in a way that could be seen as offensive
creations-chat 2019-03-16 00:13:07 Oh, that's because to be honest, it is pretty low on the relative quality standard
creations-chat 2019-03-16 00:13:32 First of all, it's trying to blend function and fashion together, which ~~almost~~ never works
creations-chat 2019-03-16 00:13:51 Second, all the functionality parts it DOES have are ineffective, at best, even considering all the possible scenarios it'd be in
creations-chat 2019-03-16 00:14:29 The only clever part is how he used the landing gear like a little radar, and even then people have done that before, it's not new
creations-chat 2019-03-16 00:14:40 What'd he get muted for?
creations-chat 2019-03-16 00:15:08 Likely he did something that grabbed negative attention
creations-chat 2019-03-16 00:15:59 No idea, probably for something though, I know the mod team might be a bit twitchy here and there, but they don't do this stuff for no reason
creations-chat 2019-03-16 03:20:52 Det, be nice, he isn't looking for a high rank
creations-chat 2019-03-16 03:21:10 .... <@!326460241048895489> , I can see what you've deleted, be, nice
creations-chat 2019-03-16 03:21:25 Not everyone's a god maestro of Plane Crazy

help 2019-03-16 03:37:38 Check to see if your suggestion was made, and make sure it's a good and well-explained suggestion
help 2019-03-16 05:19:40 You mean treads?
creations-chat 2019-03-16 05:30:50 It's not exactly modeller either, since people have made tracks with that style before
creations-chat 2019-03-16 05:31:47 Good attempt though
creations-chat 2019-03-16 05:33:12 I was about to say
creations-chat 2019-03-16 05:35:05 Someone has "invented" a useless box, sorry Legendary
the-dump 2019-03-16 05:36:47 Whatever happened to him? All the other stuff he does is just plain amazing madness
the-dump 2019-03-16 13:57:02 And incredibly lucky at the same time
the-dump 2019-03-16 13:57:16 It didn't detonate
creations-chat 2019-03-16 13:59:02 Done
creations-chat 2019-03-16 14:16:46 I'm pretty much always responsive, even if it's a late response
creations-chat 2019-03-16 14:18:31 Click on your name in the chat or on the right
creations-chat 2019-03-16 14:18:49 Not a problem, whoever ranked you forgot to give you the "ranked" role, which unlocks everything else
creations-chat 2019-03-16 14:20:00 I mean, make sure the suggestions are good
the-dump 2019-03-16 14:27:32 This is a dump for pretty much anything, so long as it follows the rules
the-dump 2019-03-16 20:17:05 Don't try that again

the-dump 2019-03-16 20:18:34 God freaking
the-dump 2019-03-16 20:24:31 If someone tries to evade a ban, they're not honest people, and if they leave especially after getting a warn, which is limited for the time they're in the server, they're especially dishonest

help 2019-03-18 04:04:10 Do "&suggest (Your suggestion here)" in <#384027830192832513> , please check <#507673335816126509> to see if your suggestion was made, use CTRL+F to search up keywords in there, and make sure it's a good suggestion
creations-chat 2019-03-18 18:09:10 For the love of, let me clean up your previous pictures
creations-chat 2019-03-18 18:09:24 Duplicates have been cleaned up
creations-chat 2019-03-18 18:09:42 Read the pins in <#478584971670454284> on how to suggest
creations-chat 2019-03-18 18:11:22 To add your suggestion to <#507673335816126509>
creations-chat 2019-03-18 18:12:42 I meant, if you have a suggestion on what you want to add to Plane Crazy to <#507673335816126509> , for people to vote upon it, and for Rick to consider it, go to <#478584971670454284> , and check the pins
creations-chat 2019-03-20 18:17:22 Wait, what do you mean by that?
creations-chat 2019-03-20 18:18:02 So, basically, all turret movement is tied to a single motor instead of a motor per turret?
creations-chat 2019-03-20 18:18:13 Wait, even elevation on the turret!?
creations-chat 2019-03-20 18:19:24 I'm gonna discuss it with the others
creations-chat 2019-03-20 18:19:37 Show it working and we'll decide
creations-chat 2019-03-20 18:22:03 <@323414243074506763> You might be onto something, let's see a gif of it in action
creations-chat 2019-03-20 18:22:44 Alright then
creations-chat 2019-03-20 18:23:20 Just hurl it through a converter
the-dump 2019-03-21 01:35:08 <@!191664513911750657> ....
the-dump 2019-03-21 01:35:33 Nope, too late
the-dump 2019-03-21 01:35:41 You shouldn't have posted it in the first place ya fucking pervert
the-dump 2019-03-21 01:35:56 He posted an NSFW slideshow
the-dump 2019-03-22 17:37:55 <@338385478476759040> , What are you trying to do exactly?
the-dump 2019-03-22 17:40:52 Shouldn't he have gotten the hint that there's a bot that's sniping giant ASCII art? Not to mention I've barely seen him do anything, and he just joined and left the server once already?
the-dump 2019-03-22 17:42:52 Not even a single page of activity last time I checked
the-dump 2019-03-22 17:43:08 Meh, alright, fair, I do that as well sometimes
the-dump 2019-03-22 17:43:36 Just wanted to check incase you wanted to cause trouble (God knows we have a billion of those people daily)
the-dump 2019-03-22 17:44:03 I'm assuming "lol no, I don't want to cause trouble" and "Yeup, we get alot of problems"
the-dump 2019-03-22 17:44:29 Trust me Pick, even people with sensible names do stuff like posting a picture of, you know what let's not get into that and just say it breaks Rule 2 outright
the-dump 2019-03-22 17:45:18 Yeaaahhhh, no, that's what they all say, but meh, you seem like a nice guy, just don't cause problems
the-dump 2019-03-22 17:47:43 <#384021699466756107> is now, well, <#384021699466756107> , post anything (As long as it follows the rules) there that you want
the-dump 2019-03-22 17:48:00 Random memes still go in <#495286269459300364> though
the-dump 2019-03-22 18:23:54 For the love of fuck ...
the-dump 2019-03-22 18:24:06 Seriously though it is irritating
the-dump 2019-03-22 18:24:32 Then again I'm in a highly irritable mood right now, but to be honest, I would be irritated by it either way
the-dump 2019-03-22 18:27:04 Well, the dump's being used, whether cancerously toxic or not I can't say
the-dump 2019-03-22 18:32:39 It literally says "Gorilla" ...
the-dump 2019-03-22 18:36:04 He said "ok" not "yes" or "no"
the-dump 2019-03-22 18:37:11 Can you please type fucking english!? I can't read broken idiot! (Yes I'm genuinely getting pissed at this point)
the-dump 2019-03-22 18:37:51 We have those, they're called 1X1 Cylinders, and last time I checked they don't connect on any side aside from their flat sides
the-dump 2019-03-22 18:38:35 ... If the problem's aesthetics, then work around it
the-dump 2019-03-22 18:38:58 Also, <@!351542650526236674> , please effing explain your things better
the-dump 2019-03-22 18:39:23 Colonel, actually BUILD something for the love of damnnation, all I've seen you build is that micro, thing
the-dump 2019-03-22 18:40:16 Show me ...
the-dump 2019-03-22 18:41:03 Specify the suggestions more, such as the quarter block one, do you mean a quarter of the width? Length? Height? What? (Don't add to that one by the way, just do it with any future suggestions)
the-dump 2019-03-22 18:42:28 I know now podo, but only because I got the context from here
the-dump 2019-03-22 18:42:36 Others might not get this context, so please include it in the suggestion
the-dump 2019-03-22 18:42:47 You don't have to revise previous suggestions, just do it for future suggestions
the-dump 2019-03-22 18:43:47 Prime example: "A block and cylinder that are a quarter of their length and width, but not height"
the-dump 2019-03-22 18:46:29 <@!351542650526236674> That was an even worse suggestion, no offense, but I'm struggling to understand what you mean
<@!493140782488748043> A friend found it for me online
the-dump 2019-03-23 19:03:14 Then don't try it
the-dump 2019-03-23 19:11:22 ?warn
the-dump 2019-03-23 19:11:25 Delete it, now <@!335599526414909451>
the-dump 2019-03-23 19:11:50 No euphemisms, period
the-dump 2019-03-23 19:12:02 ... __**NOW**__
creations-chat 2019-03-23 19:52:32 Aircraft catapults aren't that impressive to be honest
creations-chat 2019-03-23 19:56:08 Something entirely new, that has a non-niche function, that isn't fulfilled by other objects
creations-chat 2019-03-23 19:57:22 Folding's a good example, back when that was introduced, it allowed much larger builds to be made
Magnet drives allow extremely high powered crafts
So on and so forth
creations-chat 2019-03-23 19:58:06 There's like 3 billion walkers, and not the gyros either, those have been made before as well
creations-chat 2019-03-23 19:58:40 Still counts as magnet engines
creations-chat 2019-03-23 19:58:48 Unless they're THAT much stronger than normal magnet engines
creations-chat 2019-03-23 20:00:38 Oooohhhhh, there's an idea
creations-chat 2019-03-23 20:00:52 I got an idea for inventor, but I'm not sharing it
creations-chat 2019-03-23 20:01:04 Yeeeeeup
creations-chat 2019-03-23 20:02:39 I think so
creations-chat 2019-03-23 20:02:55 If you can think of it within a day, someone's probably already thought up of it
creations-chat 2019-03-23 20:04:33 They made a mechanism that actually acted like a genuine piano, even striking the corresponding string
the-dump 2019-03-23 20:10:25 <@!343927284819820556> Change your PFP if you don't mind
the-dump 2019-03-23 20:10:59 ....
creations-chat 2019-03-23 20:16:00 Alright, here's an idea, nobody's ever built a physically adjustable on/off mechanism
creations-chat 2019-03-23 20:16:23 Like, an ACTUAL switch or button that you press, using your physical character in-game, to toggle something
creations-chat 2019-03-23 20:16:27 I don't remember what I built to be honest
creations-chat 2019-03-23 20:16:36 Not like that
creations-chat 2019-03-23 20:16:45 Think of it like a switch to turn on a fan or something
creations-chat 2019-03-23 20:17:14 A switch, in-game, with motors that are either always on or always off, that you can adjust using an external force
creations-chat 2019-03-23 20:17:30 Example: Building a hand, to flip a switch, to "turn on" a fan
creations-chat 2019-03-23 20:17:38 And being able to turn it off as well
creations-chat 2019-03-23 20:17:54 I can imagine a mechanic to do so infact
creations-chat 2019-03-23 20:18:06 Not just a button Empire, that's actually probably a harder thing
creations-chat 2019-03-23 20:18:12 Probably a switch would be easier
creations-chat 2019-03-25 04:07:07 For the love of god, change it to daylight please, we can barely tell any details
creations-chat 2019-03-25 04:07:22 Also I didn't realize the red one was different, sorry about that
creations-chat 2019-03-25 04:07:32 Mind reposting the open one?
creations-chat 2019-03-25 04:08:53 Use the cog to force it to day
help 2019-03-26 04:04:48 It's actually completely vital to making most creations work
help 2019-03-26 04:05:02 If it's in the way, then not to be rude, but you're building too small
help 2019-03-26 16:06:55 .......... Excuse me?
help 2019-03-26 16:07:10 Explain what's going on, now
help 2019-03-26 16:08:10 Ah
the-dump 2019-03-26 23:21:07 <@!340543153922768906> , if it's NSFW, of course you're gonna be banned, double, and triple check that every part of it is SFW, otherwise you're going to be severely warned for it
help 2019-03-26 23:27:13 Decouplers
the-dump 2019-03-27 21:15:58 <@!168154760866693120> , Cut it out before you get a banhammer to the face then
the-dump 2019-03-28 01:07:29 -Hands Opportunity a new battery and solar panel- Delivery
the-dump 2019-03-28 23:16:22 Tis why you never dig straight down, no matter what
creations-chat 2019-03-29 23:26:08 <@473554619901935627> , That's a freaking tiny carrier, I doubt even my Wyvern could land on it
creations-chat 2019-03-29 23:26:30 <@!404731699033931786> , check <#544022464133595166> more thoroughly
creations-chat 2019-03-29 23:27:58 Ehhhhh? No offense but I doubt, considering you used so many beams, that it'd even count for midshipman
creations-chat 2019-03-29 23:28:11 Although then again I'm just eyeballing it
creations-chat 2019-03-29 23:28:25 ... How do you have almost 700 blocks in that thing? Seriously, how?
creations-chat 2019-03-29 23:28:49 Also, read the fine print at the top of <#544022464133595166>
the-dump 2019-03-29 23:29:12 Isn't that Basewars?
creations-chat 2019-03-29 23:31:11 We do that for one specific reason: Under Discord's new Terms of Service, it's basically illegal for anyone under the age of 13 without parental permission (Nobody pays attention to the last part) to use Discord, and knowingly being on Discord against this, or allowing people on your server that don't apply to this, can lead to severe consequences
creations-chat 2019-03-29 23:32:36 You need at least one of them to show your profile in the upper right of the screen
creations-chat 2019-03-29 23:33:04 And do note: If you ARE under 13, say so now, and you will be allowed to come back to the server on your own accord, when you are 13 years of age or older
creations-chat 2019-03-29 23:33:38 Well, alright, I'll give you that, do try to make an actually larger carrier though
creations-chat 2019-03-29 23:37:24 It's fine
the-dump 2019-03-29 23:38:26 To be 100% honest, fuck Basewars, the creator went the way of EA, cash grab quantity over quality
the-dump 2019-03-29 23:39:06 And what pisses me off most is he literally doesn't care about quality, I showed him a video of someone deleting the map, with hammer tool in his hand, and he messaged me back going "I don't see a hacker here"
the-dump 2019-03-29 23:39:35 __***LIKE LEGITIMATELY, WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK!?***__, but yeah, I will never look at D4rk the same way ever again after that
the-dump 2019-03-29 23:41:01 I just want a good and popular air or space focused game, maybe with some amount of custom building (Don't get me wrong, Plane Crazy's amazing, but it does have it's limitations, then again it's alot better than most games)
the-dump 2019-03-29 23:43:09 Well, aside from the obvious (Lag, lack of high speed offensive weaponry, being pretty grounded to realistic builds), I guess there's no real sense of progression, aside from the player's own creativity and skill, which, while every bit of that progression is extremely satisfying, it caps off very quickly, and increases very slowly
the-dump 2019-03-29 23:43:48 ^
I would __***FUCKING KILL***__ for something like Avorion on Roblox
creations-chat 2019-03-29 23:44:04 Alright, good luck Hauserr
the-dump 2019-03-29 23:45:19 I'd literally buy robux or get a roblox giftcard to shove into that game as many times as I can (Barring 100 robux just incase I wanna buy something for myself like Cruise Ship Tycoon [Which by the way just entered beta today, and it's price is now 1/10th the amount])
the-dump 2019-03-29 23:46:59 I can cooperate with a couple of branches of mine, I'm helping to test for 2 groups
the-dump 2019-03-29 23:47:20 Er, not Roblox groups, I meant Discord groups that are making Roblox games, er, YOU GET THE POINT!
the-dump 2019-03-29 23:49:01 It's made by the same guy that made Retail Tycoon, soooo
the-dump 2019-03-29 23:49:19 Let me just pull up my store to show you
the-dump 2019-03-29 23:49:58 
the-dump 2019-03-29 23:50:13 With 600K money in that game, I can safely say I've spent way too much time in it, and the 25 robux I spent was worth it
the-dump 2019-03-29 23:50:40 If for nothing else, Retail Tycoon's a fucking fantastic time sink, while Cruise Ship? I can't say, I haven't played it, I don't have the money for it
the-dump 2019-03-29 23:51:26 I did have a pretty fun time showing some of my friends around in the game though

creations-chat 2019-04-20 17:30:11 Probably because they're so hard to hit
creations-chat 2019-04-20 17:30:34 Yeah, definitely because they're so small and hard to hit

creations-chat 2019-05-04 19:53:11 Ah, so you made 2, linked their controls together?
creations-chat 2019-05-04 19:54:16 Cool
creations-chat 2019-05-04 19:54:37 I tried a similar idea, except with actual people in different planes, this is the best result

the-dump 2019-05-05 03:24:23 You weren't involved in this, so it's not you that's being "racisted"
the-dump 2019-05-05 03:26:36 RIGHT, DAILY REMINDER TO ALL YOU ASSHOLES THINKING ABOUT POSTING MORE SHIT IN HERE, THIS PLACE STILL FOLLOWS THE RULES, READ THE DISCLAIMER AT THE TOP YA FUCKWITS, if that seems harsh, that's because we've had 2 people that broke rules in here

the-dump 2019-05-05 03:27:19 Colonel, how about you be quiet?
the-dump 2019-05-05 03:27:53 And Rytim, quite frankly, if you can't follow the rules, get out of the server, it pretty much boils down to "be a decent human being"

the-dump 2019-05-05 03:30:40 Imperial that might be a bit harsh
the-dump 2019-05-05 03:31:14 I'm just in a bad mood because people can't be bothered reading
the-dump 2019-05-05 03:31:33 Yes Imperial, people tend to take a hint when you slap them with a giant stop sign
the-dump 2019-05-05 03:31:48 I refuse to go anywhere with you ...
the-dump 2019-05-05 03:32:09 Or settle it my way, https://i.imgur.com/EaZiQTG.gif?noredirect
the-dump 2019-05-05 03:33:38 Okay but seriously, just cut the crap, it's not a directed message, and you should only get offended by it if you actually fit the criteria within it, in which case it's your own fault for acting that way
the-dump 2019-05-05 03:34:41 I happened to be trying to type that out after the microgun gif
the-dump 2019-05-05 03:35:35 ... <@!481807144963014657> , Are you, ACTUALLY trying to cause ear damage?

the-dump 2019-05-05 03:38:10 .... That doesn't make sense Empire, let me run through what I meant a bit more thoroughly
I had my headphones plugged in, and when I took them off after hearing that, I could still hear it quite audibly, even with the volume at 2 as well
the-dump 2019-05-05 03:38:39 Yes Colonel, it was so loud that I could hear them outside of my headphones, and don't even get me started on what it was like WITH them on
the-dump 2019-05-05 03:39:26 These ones are freaking quiet if you aren't wearing them
the-dump 2019-05-05 03:40:17 To give an idea of what these are like, a video sounds like a 2, when I have them at 100%, and aren't wearing them

creations-chat 2019-05-06 18:05:25 ... Excuse me while I throw up at that "boat" that funny has
creations-chat 2019-05-06 18:05:50 It's a mobile gun platform, not a fucking boat by any definition
creations-chat 2019-05-06 18:06:07 And even if it's original, it's going to burn into people's minds yes, by how awful and low effort it is
creations-chat 2019-05-06 18:06:17 BOTH OF YOU CUT IT OUT
creations-chat 2019-05-06 18:06:49 Funny, it's low effort, and unoriginal, you literally just took the gun turret idea and attached it to a "boat", which is nothing more than a bunch of wedges mashed together, end of fucking story
creations-chat 2019-05-06 18:07:34 I do not give a damn what you think, I've seen almost every single build in this game and I can say with certainty that quite literally someone built a floating gun platform before
creations-chat 2019-05-06 18:07:41 End, of, story
creations-chat 2019-05-06 18:08:29 I will grab a dictionary and bash your fucking dumbass face in, specifically with the page citing what original is, because I literally mentioned that someone built a gun platform before on the water in a very similar fashion as to what you have done
creations-chat 2019-05-06 18:08:48 And TL;DR, nobody's going to care about what you say at this rate
creations-chat 2019-05-06 18:09:24 Alright, you want me to fucking look up the definition of original? I'll fucking hang you with those words
creations-chat 2019-05-06 18:10:23 Here's literally ALL of the definitions of "original" (In 2 parts)
creations-chat 2019-05-06 18:10:29 
creations-chat 2019-05-06 18:11:14 Your fucking floating turret isn't original, people have made it before in multiple iterations, maybe you're original in the worst of ways
creations-chat 2019-05-06 18:11:40 TL;DR, you don't care because you want to lock yourself in a narcissistic bubble and believe that you're right
creations-chat 2019-05-06 18:11:57 And I'm saying it isn't, to the point where I
creations-chat 2019-05-06 18:12:14 Infact, I'm LITERALLY going to take it down unless you shut up and quit trying to push for modeler
creations-chat 2019-05-06 18:13:08 Oh look, your "original" work which millions of people have already made, is gone from <#384025409945337856> , because someone wouldn't get their head __***OUT OF THEIR DAMN ASS***__
creations-chat 2019-05-06 18:13:27 Now turn around and go fucking read the rules and ranks again
creations-chat 2019-05-06 18:14:05 Then show us this logic and "defition"
creations-chat 2019-05-06 18:14:22 And yours aren't?

creations-chat 2019-05-12 20:22:07 I made a note on him
creations-chat 2019-05-12 20:22:59 Sadly with the way Discord moderation works, we needed to have not deleted his thing in order for them to actually take action against him
creations-chat 2019-05-12 20:23:15 And they do infact need evidence of such a thing happening
creations-chat 2019-05-12 20:23:32 Perfect

creations-chat 2019-05-15 03:08:08 It's highly frowned upon by, basically everyone, but it's not specifically against the rules

creations-chat 2019-05-19 07:08:04 Let me be blunt here, none of these are good, I could get my friend to make them in about an hour, they're not well detailed, nor are they mechanically interesting at all
creations-chat 2019-05-19 07:08:34 No no, just leave them
creations-chat 2019-05-19 07:08:40 Just, develop further next time
creations-chat 2019-05-19 17:04:39 <@!257194741815312384> , please no .wmvs, also I can tell you have enough surface space to crry vehicles, I'd suggest getting rid of that small bump though
creations-chat 2019-05-19 17:33:19 Doing a rough guestimate of parts, it's around the range of 300, maybe 400 parts in it, right?
bot-central 2019-05-19 17:37:09 By the way <@410164867165716507> , try not to leak links, we've had multiple security issues before
creations-chat 2019-05-19 17:37:31 Turns out it was 1200 something, it's been too long since I last guessed stuff like this
bot-central 2019-05-19 17:38:43 People do tend to try to cause a crapstorm every so often, but that's with every server right?
creations-chat 2019-05-20 06:08:16 Hey <@!324707302470844416> , Congrats on the rankings
creations-chat 2019-05-22 18:42:51 Hey <@410164867165716507> , you got the rank
creations-chat 2019-05-23 20:18:43 Alright then, let me check
creations-chat 2019-05-23 20:19:06 Nice design by the way, gonna be pretty hard to knock that thing loose
creations-chat 2019-05-23 20:20:00 You probably know the drill for being ranked, no sharing VIP link, no bad suggestions please (We've had a few recently, not pointing out which ones though), yada yada
creations-chat 2019-05-23 20:20:06 Anyways, enjoy the rank
creations-chat 2019-05-23 20:25:29 Done
creations-chat 2019-05-23 20:26:34 <@221487880487436288> , weren't you banned for something? I don't have a note on you
creations-chat 2019-05-23 20:28:06 Well, whatever reason you were banned for, you're unbanned now, don't do it again
help 2019-05-24 02:40:03 Always on/off?
help 2019-05-24 02:40:22 Well, with always on/off you need to hold down the key
help 2019-05-24 02:40:41 I have no idea then
help 2019-05-24 02:40:50 Show the F9
bot-central 2019-05-24 20:36:21 Give it a moment
bot-central 2019-05-24 20:36:25 Probably just got overloaded
creations-chat 2019-05-26 01:03:58 Nice attention to detail, a bit wedge-shaped, but still, as far as I can see the proportions are similar
creations-chat 2019-05-26 01:04:07 I'll bump ya up to Sea Marshal
creations-chat 2019-05-26 01:04:20 <@168362561597603841>

help 2019-05-26 07:19:00 Thanks, the thing is if we don't give people a **VERY** thorough reminder, they tend to do it again
bot-central 2019-05-27 05:51:31 <@!508314435945889802> ....
bot-central 2019-05-27 05:51:49 Don't try that again
bot-central 2019-05-27 05:52:16 *A mod* ***CASUALLY*** *gives you a warn*
bot-central 2019-05-27 05:52:34 Then quit trying to bend the rules
the-dump 2019-05-27 06:00:06 Katze ...
the-dump 2019-05-27 06:00:37 Let me just be blunt here Katze: You're a BIT aggressive recently, maybe wind down and take a break
the-dump 2019-05-27 06:00:45 Raptor, you're not helping
the-dump 2019-05-27 06:01:31 ..... Are you intentionally just trying to piss off people until someone snaps at you and one of the mods gets called to ban you?
the-dump 2019-05-27 06:02:08 ..........
the-dump 2019-05-27 06:02:40 That much is obvious raptor
the-dump 2019-05-27 06:02:53 That wasn't a complement ...
the-dump 2019-05-27 06:03:42 I get it Turismo
the-dump 2019-05-27 06:03:48 It won't be me though
the-dump 2019-05-27 06:03:51 Aggression, that's why
the-dump 2019-05-27 06:04:50 Isn't that what you openly admitted to <@!508314435945889802> ?
the-dump 2019-05-27 06:05:15 
creations-chat 2019-05-27 14:46:58 Fucking hell <@!302698900521877504> , well done, that's modeler-worthy and pretty much blasts out the gate with 33 upvotes (Discluding bot and countered by downvotes) in a single day
creations-chat 2019-05-27 14:56:00 Trust me, in the voting market, it's very hard to get people to do stuff, hence why master designer's only 20 instead of something like 50
creations-chat 2019-05-27 14:57:32 Well give us the completed version and watch the crowd go wild
help 2019-05-27 23:15:20 <@!208764105681666049> , Think of every action like levers, the further away from the center they are, the more force is applied
help 2019-05-27 23:15:43 Technically less speed yes, but considering how much air resistance those wings put up, more force basically equals more speed
help 2019-05-27 23:16:07 Having the affecting surfaces farther from the center of mass will help
help 2019-05-27 23:16:36 Hence why if you need to dedicate one axis to things, you dedicate pitch to the front and back-most wings, roll to the edges of the main wings, and yaw (obviously) to the tail
help 2019-05-27 23:33:53 You get alot more force out of them
help 2019-05-27 23:37:46 Too much backwards lift, if the lift is behind the center of mass, you pitch downwards
bot-central 2019-05-29 21:35:08 <@!508788110906097719> , Do, you, MIND!?

creations-chat 2019-06-01 20:36:27 What?
creations-chat 2019-06-01 20:38:11 Sea Marshal, that's it right?
creations-chat 2019-06-01 20:38:30 It's fine
creations-chat 2019-06-02 01:14:28 God fucking damn it <@!429665143677255681> , it's fine though
creations-chat 2019-06-02 01:14:37 Also hi Ignacioel
creations-chat 2019-06-02 01:14:57 Yeeeeup
creations-chat 2019-06-02 23:50:55 I'm not an expert on the bots sadly
creations-chat 2019-06-05 04:20:09 <@456226577798135808> , don't repost, it just seems petty and needy, you're allowed to repost if you make improvements, but not if it's entirely unchanged
creations-chat 2019-06-06 01:52:24 Iron cross is fine, just not the swastika
the-dump 2019-06-06 20:36:10 .... <@!299947216641064960>
the-dump 2019-06-06 20:45:39 It was NSFW Reddy, don't deny it, I already deleted it ...
bug-reports 2019-06-07 20:05:39 Did you build it pointing the other way around or something?
bug-reports 2019-06-07 20:12:09 Look where the arrow's pointing, did you build the fighter in reverse?
creations-chat 2019-06-07 23:10:08 Tutorials are highly frowned upon, although if you're the first verified person to make the tutorial, you'll be fine, but if ANYONE ELSE is found with the creation at an earlier date, you'll be shot on the spot (metaphorically of course)
creations-chat 2019-06-08 19:53:41 <@!403911797532262401> , No .wmv files please, they may contain viruses, use a GIF converter, and if you don't have one, use Google to look for one
creations-chat 2019-06-08 19:54:11 It's fine, alot of people make the .wmv mistake
creations-chat 2019-06-08 19:54:27 Which makes it even harder to separate the viruses from the real deal .wmvs
creations-chat 2019-06-08 19:57:15 Lower left hand corner, next to the textbox, you should see a + symbol
creations-chat 2019-06-08 19:57:25 If it's a GIF, you put it there, or you put the GIF link in the text
creations-chat 2019-06-09 00:30:46 So wait, you're basically saying you can look at a picture, analyze how it functions, and replicate it in Plane Crazy basically?
creations-chat 2019-06-09 00:30:57 Niiiice
creations-chat 2019-06-09 00:33:03 The micro plane?
creations-chat 2019-06-09 00:36:08 Oh, I've seen that, it's a me jet isn't it?
help 2019-06-10 03:13:57 <@232694074501496833> , it's a snow engine, a winter event exclusive item, it's not actually that powerful, it just looks fancy
the-dump 2019-06-12 22:05:58 <@456226577798135808> ...... Delete the one before that, now
help 2019-06-12 23:25:28 Do we even need to mention it? There's a fantastic thing called ballasts you know
the-dump 2019-06-13 15:50:08 ...... <@224331596906364928> , that first one ...
the-dump 2019-06-13 15:52:17 "that first one" ...
creations-chat 2019-06-14 02:00:46 ..... <@!191446848999915520> , The tail, body and nose are all the same based on the screenshots I have access to, the only thing that's different is that yours is very badly co-axial
creations-chat 2019-06-14 02:06:08 Because there is an extremely high probability that the primary body of the craft is simply being copied from the original owner <@!302698900521877504>
the-dump 2019-06-14 02:17:24 Not so much NSFW Empire so much as controversial, and generally just rude
the-dump 2019-06-14 02:17:35 But yeah it does deserve a warn
the-dump 2019-06-14 02:23:33 It's fine
the-dump 2019-06-14 02:23:38 At least as far as I can see
the-dump 2019-06-14 02:33:44 ........... I'd say delete it
the-dump 2019-06-14 02:33:52 Just to be safe
the-dump 2019-06-14 02:43:17 .... <@!382347931019378691> , I don't give a damn about either side, but I'd suggest you take that fucking statement back, because to be honest, that was rude as hell
the-dump 2019-06-14 02:44:35 Then keep your opinion to yourself
the-dump 2019-06-14 02:44:50 Nobody cares who likes what, so long as they keep them to themselves
the-dump 2019-06-14 02:44:55 .... **AHEM**
the-dump 2019-06-14 02:45:27 Fucking hell keyboard
the-dump 2019-06-14 02:45:47 The thing underneath it's starting to shift to the left or something
the-dump 2019-06-14 02:45:49 Just, don't push it guys
the-dump 2019-06-14 02:47:55 ..... God fucking, I keep on telling Voxel to update that
the-dump 2019-06-14 02:48:33 Sod it, it's the dump after all, anything NSFW I will snipe down though, and I don't care if I hit the person who posted it
creations-chat 2019-06-14 02:59:49 They're exceptionally similar, I doubt the nose was the only thing you copied
creations-chat 2019-06-14 03:02:22 Meh, get permission from him and you'll be free to copy, but otherwise it's too similar
creations-chat 2019-06-14 23:09:55 Bloody hell it's super stubby
creations-chat 2019-06-14 23:23:29 .... <@!418943249588420618> , Change it
creations-chat 2019-06-14 23:52:25 10 minutes
creations-chat 2019-06-15 20:30:56 Is it ACTUALLY faster is the big question
creations-chat 2019-06-15 20:31:25 Put 2 flipper style motors side-by-side, one uncapped, one at the cap, if the uncapped one lobs it's self further, then it works
the-dump 2019-06-15 20:40:55 .....
help 2019-06-16 18:43:30 Force it to day, use the settings
help 2019-06-16 18:50:42 Like abnormal downwards pitch, even for having lift so far in the back?
help 2019-06-16 18:51:04 Were you able to pull up before at about 600+ speed?
help 2019-06-16 18:52:05 Your center of lift is why, the further back it is, the more of an effect it has, and the faster you're going, the more lift it creates
the-dump 2019-06-17 06:17:25 .... Uhhhh, <@418361319440384001> , What the fuck?
the-dump 2019-06-17 06:17:36 How is that funny exactly, and not simply offensive?
the-dump 2019-06-17 06:18:30 Ehhhhh, fine morbid
creations-chat 2019-06-19 01:25:35 .............
creations-chat 2019-06-19 01:26:10 Oh whatever
creations-chat 2019-06-19 01:26:18 The point's the same anyways
help 2019-06-19 02:44:22 These aren't our builds, we're reporting people that make these builds
creations-chat 2019-06-19 16:58:17 Small planes are actually surprisingly easy and unsurprisingly very low effort to make
creations-chat 2019-06-19 16:59:11 They're supposed to be on the back of the wings normally, not on the front
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:00:10 .... <@!210141202698338304> , The faster you go, the stronger they get, not to mention mouse controlled is really weak in the first place, and optimized control surfaces actually have a hell of alot of kick
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:00:21 Also seriously, how?
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:00:36 Look at this, almost 2K parts
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:01:09 Yet it flies like this, like 350ish parts
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:01:39 I mean okay fine true but still <@!210141202698338304>
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:02:02 Also I built the thing purely for performance Laurence
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:02:20 Point is you can build something massive, and have it maneuver like a tiny thing, if you design it well
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:04:11 Probably because it's designed very badly? Legitimately there's no other reason it shouldn't work
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:04:59 "tbf", have you seen anyone even come close to doing any better with a modular aerodynamic system?
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:05:16 Introgue, how does that thing fly? The center of lift is SO far back
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:06:10 Have you TRIED anything else?
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:06:34 It's fine Introgue
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:06:40 Not really
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:07:03 Uhhhh, scratch out "look nice" ...
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:07:24 I mean, if you design it with care, sure, but still
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:07:29 .... Excuse me?
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:07:48 Are you really trying to challenge me to make a good looking small craft?
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:08:00 Also they are rather nice Introgue
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:09:51 Alright then, challenge accepted
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:10:43 Then don't complain when a poorly built small thing doesn't work, they're finickey little suckers
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:11:03 Then learn how to make magnet drives or use the actual propeller blades
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:12:28 Super rockets were there purely because people kept on complaining that rockets weren't strong enough, which stemmed from people complaining that jet engines weren't strong enough
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:13:26 "Super jet", are you sure you know what you're talking about?
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:13:55 How is it vague? It's a supersized jet engine
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:14:03 Plus if you're using that, you're using something massively inferior
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:14:31 Double plus we've already addressed that super rockets are basically just stronger regular rockets, so presumably a "super jet" would be a stronger regular jet, not a huge jet engine
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:16:22 Laurence, functionality and fashion don't go together in Plane Crazy, very few people are able to use both of them
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:16:38 Now afk for driving stuff
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:17:20 And FYI, magnet drives are rather large engines that are entirely silent, extremely reliable, and propel you forward faster than a super rocket is ever capable of doing, even when it's unburdened
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:19:19 Laurence, speaking of age, how old are you?
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:20:00 I have the right to ask when I think someone's underage, due to Terms of Service limiting the minimal age, and considering your behavior and lack of understanding of everything (And no I'm not driving YET)
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:20:05 Also it's fine Deciduss, it looks nice
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:20:50 I might be older, I might be younger, who knows
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:20:58 And no it doesn't
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:21:27 I can ask people for their age if I think they're underage on the server, since it's required that we ban people that are underage
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:22:48 ......... Just, what kind of logic is that exactly?
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:23:51 I'm out anyways, <@456226577798135808> , mind taking over for these two idiots? And yeah, just post a picture just like killin did
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:23:57 It's good enough for this
creations-chat 2019-06-20 00:29:41 It's, "unique", I guess? Maybe?
creations-chat 2019-06-20 03:43:50 <@!217338313357393920> , late reply, but unless you're everyone, that's completely false
bot-central 2019-06-22 06:32:47 You're already verified
bot-central 2019-06-22 06:38:08 ?
bot-central 2019-06-22 06:38:11 What do you mean?
bot-central 2019-06-22 06:39:56 You need a rank from <#544022464133595166> , due to the fact that we've had people ruin the specific VIP servers in the past, namely unranked people, and yes, it was just THAT much of a pattern
bot-central 2019-06-22 06:40:00 What news server?
bot-central 2019-06-22 06:40:43 Literally everyone can see announcements ...
bot-central 2019-06-22 21:07:23 !servers
bot-central 2019-06-22 21:07:32 ......
bot-central 2019-06-22 21:07:38 !servers
creations-chat 2019-06-24 03:19:38 ..... Really?
creations-chat 2019-06-24 03:25:02 No, you aren't getting inventor for that, be lucky you're still on the damn server infact
creations-chat 2019-06-24 03:25:33 Cut it the fuck out guys ...
creations-chat 2019-06-24 03:46:22 .... Really <@456226577798135808> ?
creations-chat 2019-06-24 03:46:23 Wait ...
creations-chat 2019-06-24 03:46:28 <@!518272525684310016>

creations-chat 2019-06-24 03:47:32 <@456226577798135808> __***AHEM***__, I see your second account on here
creations-chat 2019-06-24 03:49:01 Answer, now ...
creations-chat 2019-06-24 03:52:37 You do realize I won't leave your main on here, right?
creations-chat 2019-06-24 03:52:47 And you could be potentially banned from Plane Crazy as a whole as well
creations-chat 2019-06-24 03:53:07 Then don't throw shit around on an alt, thinking you're clever
creations-chat 2019-06-24 03:53:32 Then what's with the alt?
creations-chat 2019-06-24 03:54:20 .......... There's a difference between maturity and just downright being bad
creations-chat 2019-06-24 03:55:11 Just, I feel like being in a nice mood now, you can stay on here, but get the hell on your main, and drag your alt out of this server, unless you'd like to transfer over to the alt, in which case get the main out, and stay on your alt
creations-chat 2019-06-24 03:56:18 I'm not doing it, you have full power to force your alt out of the server, so do so
creations-chat 2019-06-24 05:08:14 I already dealt with it
creations-chat 2019-06-29 15:43:54 Already covered it purified
creations-chat 2019-06-29 15:44:04 Also, Miner, I'm going to pretend you didn't make that joke, if you erase it
help 2019-06-29 17:12:50 I mean, build copying is PRETTY bad and demoralizing, I'd say it's somewhat valid, if a bit petty
help 2019-06-29 22:25:45 Center of lift is too far back, bring wings forward
help 2019-06-29 22:26:01 It's smashing your nose into the ground by lifting up the rear of your plane
help 2019-06-29 22:39:05 Engine might be above the center of mass?
help 2019-06-30 03:55:53 I don't think that's the issue, save it, then reload it, either that or rejoin

the-dump 2019-07-01 00:33:29 Seriously?
the-dump 2019-07-01 00:34:26 ?warnings <@!323110865140449282>
the-dump 2019-07-01 00:34:31 Dude, come on
creations-chat 2019-07-03 17:22:59 Self-upvoting is generally frowned upon because it's a given
creations-chat 2019-07-03 17:23:53 It's obvious that you'll like your own creation, so self-upvoting is just adding an extra point outside of the standard amount of likes/dislikes you're supposed to get
creations-chat 2019-07-03 17:24:07 Which, while it doesn't REALLY matter, it's very scummy to be honest
creations-chat 2019-07-03 17:24:26 I know, I'm just explaining why
the-dump 2019-07-04 21:16:53 ?ban <@432885129917235211> NSFW content
the-dump 2019-07-04 21:16:55 ....
the-dump 2019-07-04 21:17:01 The little fuck
the-dump 2019-07-04 21:21:07 It didn't save his damn thing, but I'm still going to throttle the fucker
the-dump 2019-07-04 21:23:21 If you still have the link, send it to me via DMs, and if you know his in-game username, send it to me as well
the-dump 2019-07-04 21:29:23 Grab, did you at LEAST grab who he was in-game?
the-dump 2019-07-04 21:31:34 I see it, bit hard to see though
the-dump 2019-07-04 21:32:51 Got it, thanks
the-dump 2019-07-04 21:35:07 Okay let's not talk about this anymore, so how's the weather?
creations-chat 2019-07-05 04:11:15 The amount of effort is, honestly, "meh", primarily because there's so little detailing, too many flat surfaces, etc
creations-chat 2019-07-05 04:12:01 Well convert it into an actual platform of war, don't just leave it as a rusted box car
creations-chat 2019-07-05 04:12:30 Add sawblades, barrels, hell, make the whole thing a missile silo, I expect it to be a segment of a fortress on rails
creations-chat 2019-07-05 04:13:12 When I hear "apocalyptic boxcar", a military base on train tracks is what I picture
creations-chat 2019-07-05 04:13:24 Well not LITERALLY, but you get the point
creations-chat 2019-07-05 04:14:29 I mean, we go overkill for a reason, for a very good reason, it's to really emphasize "Hey, this is supposed to be this thing"
bug-reports 2019-07-05 06:52:37 Wrong spot, and you need a rank to access servers, this is mostly to keep the average Roblox riffraff out of there, since said crowd tends to be, infuriating, to say the least
creations-chat 2019-07-05 17:20:57 Uhhhhhhh
creations-chat 2019-07-05 17:21:15 <@!338393512389378059> , what are you trying to do exactly?
creations-chat 2019-07-05 17:22:09 Then just use <#384025409945337856> ?
creations-chat 2019-07-05 17:23:12 It just feels suspiciously like you're trying to copy, and that might just be me being paranoid, but honestly we've had alot of issues with copiers lately
creations-chat 2019-07-09 02:54:11 <@456226577798135808> , please don't self-upvote, while it doesn't matter much for the larger numbers, it's not exactly fair to do so, as obviously you'd like your own creation
creations-chat 2019-07-09 02:54:37 Also, <@!435217108125876224> , how much more complexity can you add to it? You might be running for one of the major ranks
creations-chat 2019-07-09 02:55:58 Not inventor of course, that one's pretty much well and truly done until Rick adds another component part, but potentially modeler
creations-chat 2019-07-09 02:57:50 I mean, name another rube-goldberg device on Plane Crazy
creations-chat 2019-07-09 02:58:39 Well, good luck with the add-ons to the track
creations-chat 2019-07-09 03:08:48 It's Empire's thing, don't worry
bot-central 2019-07-09 17:23:44 !servers
bug-reports 2019-07-13 03:39:13 Not a major bug, unless it actually saves their properties
bug-reports 2019-07-13 03:39:51 Get a volunteer, have them change your keybinds and see if it does anything
bug-reports 2019-07-13 03:40:03 Also please no .wmv files, we've had a virus attack from one before
bot-central 2019-07-14 18:42:52 =skip
bot-central 2019-07-16 02:30:41 It's still fucking NSFW dude
bot-central 2019-07-16 02:31:39 I can monetize my ass on the camera, and that's still NSFW you know
bot-central 2019-07-16 02:32:11 "um", yes I have "bruh"
bot-central 2019-07-16 02:33:36 Might I direct you to rule 11, because apparently you need a fresh helping of that
bot-central 2019-07-16 02:34:58 ...... Seriously?
bot-central 2019-07-16 02:35:18 He tried pulling up a song with a very ... blunt, title, and we shut him down
bot-central 2019-07-16 02:35:40 Oh for fuck's, don't ...
bot-central 2019-07-16 02:37:41 First of all, I get to bend rule 1, when I'm (metaphorically) beating some sense into some idiot who thinks they're above the rules, I'm not saying who, but I am going to say that I've had to do that alot, with alot of people, some to the point of trying to downright ruin other people just for the shit of it
Second, no amount of arguing will clear up what you tried to post
bot-central 2019-07-16 02:38:44 There's some people you can't be nice to, hence why there's flexibility in rule 1 for mods, because people are people, and some people are just plain assholes, and you can't talk nicely to assholes
bot-central 2019-07-16 02:39:05 Ow
bot-central 2019-07-16 02:39:12 =skip
bot-central 2019-07-16 02:39:17 Okay no ow
bot-central 2019-07-16 02:51:37 =stop
bot-central 2019-07-16 02:51:42 =skip
creations-chat 2019-07-18 19:23:05 Right, <@456226577798135808> , I need to ask, how old are you?
creations-chat 2019-07-18 19:23:35 Robo! Let them leave on their own accord
creations-chat 2019-07-18 19:23:54 If he openly admits his age, he's probably willing to leave on his own accord after recognizing it's not okay to stay in the server
creations-chat 2019-07-18 19:28:38 Looks decent, too many flat surfaces though, so try to make it more detailed
creations-chat 2019-07-19 01:10:28 <@!435217108125876224> , Beck's actually from Mighty Number 9, which was basically supposed to continue the Megaman legacy, but failed so hard it was downright disappointing
creations-chat 2019-07-19 01:10:49 I think Mighty Gunvolt was supposed to be a cross-promotion thing
creations-chat 2019-07-19 01:11:06 Not alot actually
creations-chat 2019-07-19 01:13:52 To each their own I suppose, I'd suggest next time you cite pixel art like that, you cite what it is, where it's normally from, and if it's a franchise, what specifically it's from
creations-chat 2019-07-19 01:14:31 That's mostly to avoid confusion in all honesty
creations-chat 2019-07-19 01:20:44 Now attach that torpedo station to something and then we're getting somewhere, maybe an RC boat or something
the-dump 2019-07-19 23:13:41 ............
the-dump 2019-07-19 23:14:09 They were actually NSFW
the-dump 2019-07-19 23:14:17 I did look close to make sure
the-dump 2019-07-19 23:14:54 I don't bash people over the head for NSFW jokes unless they well and truly deserve it
creations-chat 2019-07-21 19:18:55 Well that's definitely very impressive
creations-chat 2019-07-21 19:26:39 Try extendable bumpers on either side, alongside guiderails
creations-chat 2019-07-21 21:45:40 Huh, cool I guess
creations-chat 2019-07-23 23:10:32 Sure
creations-chat 2019-07-23 23:11:16 Done
creations-chat 2019-07-29 03:33:58 Why all the duplicates?
creations-chat 2019-07-29 03:58:44 Ah, understandable
help 2019-07-29 05:15:52 Only Rick can boot them, and he's offline
help 2019-07-29 05:15:59 Also if that really is you, so help me
help 2019-07-29 05:16:43 Fine, but if I get further reports about you, well you can guess what'll happen
help 2019-07-29 06:08:29 Right, <@!600401420587368515> , <@!488404406350381067> , both of you, can it, and quit pointing fingers at eachother, you're both mixing things up and only showing things that make you look better, so I'm not taking either side, but I'm inclined against both of you because neither of you bothered to defend yourself outside of "I didn't do it"
bot-central 2019-08-01 23:18:38 .............. <@!260544767446745088>
bot-central 2019-08-01 23:20:09 Technically Empire's an ex-mod, so he's *sorta* allowed to minimod I guess
bot-central 2019-08-01 23:22:10 <@!282987053317226498> **Ahem**
bot-central 2019-08-01 23:22:31 Let me just roll it out, it's NSFW, end of story
bot-central 2019-08-01 23:22:59 Okay shut up about it now I'm kicking them temporarily
bot-central 2019-08-01 23:23:49 Kick streak technically
bot-central 2019-08-01 23:23:57 God I'm fucking tired and stressed
bot-central 2019-08-01 23:24:31 The whole point is to wake them up that they're still in the server, if they rejoin with another NSFW PFP, then that means it's intentional
