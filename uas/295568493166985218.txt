plane-crazy 2019-10-20 18:16:02 Thanks, back to being dead (Irl stuff and said alt making everything miserable again)
plane-crazy 2019-10-20 18:15:32 Personal request with evidence incase you're all wondering
plane-crazy 2019-10-20 18:15:16 It was an alt of someone
plane-crazy 2019-10-12 22:52:46 Back to still trying to recover, I am **very** glad I bailed off when I could, seeya guys
plane-crazy 2019-10-12 22:51:35 Oh? Do tell joey (Don't actually)
plane-crazy 2019-10-12 22:50:46 One last thing before I go by the way, MrEpic, that stuff isn't okay, at all ... nothing, even as a joke, **aside from mentioning it is happening to someone that can stop it**, will justify saying that word
plane-crazy 2019-10-12 22:49:11 Next time, __**IF**__ there's a next time, let one of the mods handle it
plane-crazy 2019-10-12 22:48:43 **Don't fight fire with fire, you'll just burn yourself even worse**
plane-crazy 2019-10-12 22:48:26 I'm retired from being a mod, but I came back on to see, that ...
plane-crazy 2019-10-12 22:47:51 There, now seeya, that shit's not okay
plane-crazy 2019-10-12 22:47:16 MrEpic, next time be nice, if there's a next time ......
plane-crazy 2019-10-12 22:47:01 Retracting that
plane-crazy 2019-10-12 22:46:26 What's going on exactly?
plane-crazy 2019-10-12 21:02:14 Well again, people are bugging me about it, "how do you get inventor" and such, hence why I'm popping back on to ask about it, since I noticed it isn't in the ranks anymore
plane-crazy 2019-10-12 21:01:21 Ah
plane-crazy 2019-10-12 21:00:22 <@!252094891448860673> , what the heck happened to inventor exactly? (I'm getting bothered by people asking how to get inventor)
plane-crazy 2019-08-25 15:18:39 <@!238017332872478720> , check <#490306593242611742> for why
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 17:47:37 It's not too chaotic, so I don't think slowmode's needed
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 17:45:30 Tesla, you're fine, we're already sure you're allowed to be on here
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 17:45:08 Raty, check the pins
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 17:44:58 Er, pins, not pings
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 17:44:52 Check the pings Raty
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 17:44:45 Yeup, I believe so
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 17:44:26 I'm tired of being a freaking broken record and just going "Rick made an accidental ping" over and over again
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 17:44:10 
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 17:44:06 **RIGHT, GUYS, RICK MADE AN ACCIDENTAL PING, CHECK <#490306593242611742> ABOUT IT IF YOU WANT MORE INFO**
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 17:43:43 Superidra, we found evidence of the old Evan (Not the one that just arrived) being under 13 years old, and he went super defensive and immature about it
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 17:42:46 Enrico, check <#490306593242611742> for why
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 17:42:36 Right, I'm turning off slowmode, since you guys seem to have gotten everything back together again
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 17:42:21 Yes, Dev Evan was underaged to use Discord
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 17:40:53 Dev, you're good
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 17:40:46 Okay okay okay no need to show proof you're good
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 17:40:40 Salak, it was an accidental ping from Rick
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 17:40:15 <@456226577798135808> , Right, let's make this clear, people <13 are legally not allowed to be on Discord, and we can get in trouble if we leave you on the server, so Dev Evan aside (Who was <13), are you 13 years or older? If not, please leave
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 17:39:26 Rick made an accidental ping
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 17:39:14 If you guys can behave yourselves, I'll remove it altogether
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 17:39:02 Decreasing slowmode now
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 17:38:42 <@232694074501496833> , It was an accident, now can you calm down about it so I can turn off slowmode?
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 17:37:37 Dev, you're free to leave if you want, nobody's stopping you
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 17:37:11 Now can you all calm down so I can happily turn off slowmode so I don't have a seizure from the sheer chaos?
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 17:36:57 It was an accidental ping from Rick
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 17:36:27 Yes I got the right one, good
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 17:36:09 Fucking hell, CAN YOU ALL JUST CALM THE HELL DOWN FOR A MOMENT!?
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 17:35:54 Wait was that the right one I swear
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 17:35:21 .... Rick pinged
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 17:35:17 It's just, a, **PING** for crud's sake, plus it was an accident
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 17:34:43 That's it, slow mode's going on until you all calm down
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 17:34:23 ............ **GUYS**
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 17:34:15 Really guys?
plane-crazy 2019-08-07 23:07:36 .... Dyno why?
plane-crazy 2019-08-07 23:07:33 ?ping
plane-crazy 2019-08-07 23:07:20 .... SHUT UP I'M TIRED AND SICK OF EVERYTHING
plane-crazy 2019-08-07 23:07:04 ?ban 575350704034807848 Preemptive ban due to mass pings just for trolling in another server
plane-crazy 2019-08-05 21:25:04 It's a game literally about sailing cruise ships
plane-crazy 2019-08-05 21:24:55 Nope
plane-crazy 2019-08-05 21:24:49 It's a Haggie game
plane-crazy 2019-08-05 21:24:47 Cruise Ship Tycoon
plane-crazy 2019-08-05 21:24:36 **The problem is** __**SURFACE SPACE**__
plane-crazy 2019-08-05 21:24:20 Because my problem is surface space
plane-crazy 2019-08-05 21:23:51 **Solar power**
plane-crazy 2019-08-04 04:19:16 Do the math
plane-crazy 2019-08-04 04:19:12 Each battery gives 500 units, each generator gives 1500
plane-crazy 2019-08-04 04:18:59 Generators take up 2X5, 10 slots, batteries take up 1X2, 2 slots (duh)
plane-crazy 2019-08-04 04:18:43 Imperial, batteries are actually potentially faster than generators
plane-crazy 2019-08-04 04:04:55 Buy bigger ships or knock down some walls
plane-crazy 2019-08-04 04:01:13 I'm going for functionality first, once I get  enough money to go crazy, I'm gonna start aesthetically designing again
plane-crazy 2019-08-04 03:58:11 Can't donate sadly
plane-crazy 2019-08-04 03:57:15 It's retail tycoon with like 10 extra layers of density ontop
plane-crazy 2019-08-04 03:56:51 Yeup
plane-crazy 2019-08-04 03:56:02 Just give it a shot, it's free
plane-crazy 2019-08-04 03:55:51 Actually have freedom to do stuff
plane-crazy 2019-08-04 03:54:43 Well, "looks good", let's face it, the top's ugly as sin, but that's for gameplay purposes, so handwave that
plane-crazy 2019-08-04 03:54:21 Also honestly it looks good, but I'd suggest converting the top to the higher quality solar panels when possible
plane-crazy 2019-08-04 03:53:55 You do realize most of us have JUST started, and we don't exactly have shedloads of money to toss around, right?
plane-crazy 2019-08-04 03:52:57 Here's the link https://www.roblox.com/games/2620293110/Free-Cruise-Ship-Tycoon#!/game-instances
plane-crazy 2019-08-04 03:51:23 It's made by Haggie, one of the few people who actually know how to do an interesting tycoon
plane-crazy 2019-08-04 02:57:53 **FINALLY** CST is free
plane-crazy 2019-08-03 23:03:46 We can get in legal trouble if we just leave you to linger around on Discord an you really are <13
plane-crazy 2019-08-03 23:03:29 Fucking, <@!300089411486351360> , can you please explain why you're marked as <13 on Roblox?
plane-crazy 2019-07-31 02:27:00 Yeah I'd say believe him for now
plane-crazy 2019-07-30 04:45:18 Also if you paid attention, you'll notice that not many parts actually overlap, so you don't have like 500 triangles per area
plane-crazy 2019-07-30 04:44:29 People keep on suggesting blender, but I've read that importing a custom mesh causes extreme lag
plane-crazy 2019-07-30 04:43:56 Spoilers: This is only the head, neck and shoulder part of it, and I say "head, neck and shoulder" instead of "nose and fuselage" for a reason
plane-crazy 2019-07-30 04:43:04 __***AND I HAVE TO DEAL WITH THIS***__
plane-crazy 2019-07-30 04:42:50 Oh yeah, I think so? I'm not sure, memory's going bad because I'm very tired of everything
plane-crazy 2019-07-30 04:41:37 Mine's floaty style, so no Brick
plane-crazy 2019-07-30 04:41:29 How long does it take to do a full 360?
plane-crazy 2019-07-30 04:40:35 Evasion's easy, just stick a ton of turning jets or control panels on, hitting your target is harder though
plane-crazy 2019-07-30 04:39:04 Or just boost the turret away
plane-crazy 2019-07-30 04:37:48 Aren't they effective against you though?
plane-crazy 2019-07-30 04:37:35 Well I need one of those AAs then
plane-crazy 2019-07-30 04:37:20 The tinfoil scrap starter planes?
plane-crazy 2019-07-30 04:36:06 And learning is how you develop your own unique style
plane-crazy 2019-07-30 04:35:43 <@!182903471022931968> , experiment, that's all I can suggest, otherwise you'll never learn
plane-crazy 2019-07-30 04:33:42 I've completely purged subs via guns actually
plane-crazy 2019-07-30 04:30:16 Just, try to keep calm Katze, and explain your goal to the other person
plane-crazy 2019-07-30 04:28:53 Er, the picture I meant
plane-crazy 2019-07-30 04:28:47 It's actually fine, so don't worry
plane-crazy 2019-07-30 04:27:36 Thank you, now can you please just leave her alone?
plane-crazy 2019-07-30 04:27:05 
plane-crazy 2019-07-30 04:27:00 Specifically this part ...
plane-crazy 2019-07-30 04:25:43 <@!561734378758340649> , **Any halfwit could tell that she's saying "thank you" to the cropping part, not to sending it**
plane-crazy 2019-07-30 04:25:24 DMs
plane-crazy 2019-07-30 04:25:11 ... Katze, can you send proof that he's doing more?
plane-crazy 2019-07-30 04:24:28 <@!561734378758340649> , can you please fucking cut it out? She's literally *asking* you to stop, and you keep on going
plane-crazy 2019-07-30 04:23:59 Pitch, pull the nose up, push the tail down
plane-crazy 2019-07-30 04:23:26 Dude, seriously?
plane-crazy 2019-07-30 04:23:11 <@!561734378758340649> , seriously?
plane-crazy 2019-07-30 04:22:40 .............
plane-crazy 2019-07-30 04:22:26 Can you both just stop?
plane-crazy 2019-07-29 21:00:46 ~~Okay that much is arguable but whatever~~ Hey
plane-crazy 2019-07-29 20:59:47 <@456226577798135808> I'll let you off with a verbal warn this time, but next time I'm going to beat you into a crater for that, got it?
plane-crazy 2019-07-29 20:59:17 Welp
plane-crazy 2019-07-29 20:58:17 It was a historical art piece of some guy peeling off his face, no inappropriate pieces showing, but he didn't have anything on
plane-crazy 2019-07-29 20:57:51 Ah, I mean, fair, sorta? Not on the NSFW one, while it's not NSFW, it is disturbing, so I won't blast you for that, but I will say, don't do it again, but the avatar one's, sorta fair I guess? Let me see if there's other ways to do it though
plane-crazy 2019-07-29 20:56:49 <@456226577798135808> , seriously?
plane-crazy 2019-07-29 20:00:19 They save in a specific spot <@!260797229068058634> , so you can remove it if you know where to look
plane-crazy 2019-07-29 19:58:54 Hi Inferno
plane-crazy 2019-07-29 19:58:35 Posting NSFW as your very first thing while joining I guess
plane-crazy 2019-07-29 19:51:33 .... I could **SEE** you're in the server Neeb
plane-crazy 2019-07-29 19:51:20 And to avoid repercussions, say it's from me, and that you're just passing the message along
plane-crazy 2019-07-29 19:51:04 <@!396830889755017218> , Mhm, kindly tell him that the only reason I'm going after him is so he doesn't throw himself in his own hole of damnnation, and if he doesn't want to get permanently banned from Discord, as well as receive legal action, he'd do his best to apologize to those who he has offended, and leave Discord until he turns 13, about a year later
plane-crazy 2019-07-29 19:48:53 <@!396830889755017218> , **Ahem**
plane-crazy 2019-07-29 19:48:34 Ah, so someone leaked in that case
plane-crazy 2019-07-29 19:47:08 I just had to, with a lack of a better descriptor, surgically extract some info from a server
plane-crazy 2019-07-29 19:46:38 And <@!311996873650995200> , don't worry about it, we aren't raiding
plane-crazy 2019-07-29 19:46:26 We would've left him be for whatever else happened if he didn't throw a hissy fit at one of our members while on the way out
plane-crazy 2019-07-29 19:45:43 And <@!396830889755017218> , for the love of damnnation, don't side with him, he's literally breaking laws by being 12 years old and using Discord
plane-crazy 2019-07-29 19:45:13 If Discord's going to club him, they're going to do it with the info I've extracted
plane-crazy 2019-07-29 19:45:03 No
plane-crazy 2019-07-29 19:44:48 Alright enough sneaking around and chasing that guy around
plane-crazy 2019-07-29 19:42:51 Then I will freaking (metaphorically) hang you
plane-crazy 2019-07-29 19:42:29 He said it in one of his own servers
plane-crazy 2019-07-29 19:42:20 That one popped to, RIP
plane-crazy 2019-07-29 19:41:33 We're "raiding" him because he's <13, and tried to hide it in this server, while also causing a shitshow about it, but guys, just leave it to me
plane-crazy 2019-07-29 19:40:11 I changed my name and PFP, without a Roblox verification system (Which I never opted into surprise surprise), I'd just show up as a different person
plane-crazy 2019-07-29 19:39:42 I'll deal with it
plane-crazy 2019-07-29 19:39:40 Er, not here at least
plane-crazy 2019-07-29 19:39:35 Crazy, don't send it yet
plane-crazy 2019-07-29 19:37:44 WAIT NONE OF YOU JOIN IT
plane-crazy 2019-07-29 19:37:37 Can confirm, he deleted the main server, RIP
plane-crazy 2019-07-29 19:31:35 Hey, that's not all that we're good at you know
plane-crazy 2019-07-29 19:31:25 Excuse me while I just vanish
plane-crazy 2019-07-29 19:31:04 DM it to me by the way
plane-crazy 2019-07-29 19:30:47 Alright, let me see what I can do, I've been able to talk a couple of idiots out of self-arrest
plane-crazy 2019-07-29 19:30:16 Oh, I don't have it
plane-crazy 2019-07-29 19:30:10 .... Who's server is it exactly?
plane-crazy 2019-07-29 19:29:50 If you can achieve a near-miss (Which I've found always happens), you'll actually be able to clip the enemy with the lava weapons
plane-crazy 2019-07-29 05:47:01 Hi
plane-crazy 2019-07-29 05:43:00 ........ If it's a temper tantrum, you won't be let back on the server you know, and I can and will just wipe everything with ease
plane-crazy 2019-07-29 05:42:00 Welp, guess that determines the side then, <@!488404406350381067> , anything to add?
plane-crazy 2019-07-29 05:41:31 Even though in <#478584971670454284> , he reported a person touting racist stuff?
plane-crazy 2019-07-29 05:40:16 Ehhhh, Noc, verdict?
plane-crazy 2019-07-29 05:39:16 ............ I really don't know which side to take here
plane-crazy 2019-07-29 05:37:22 So can you check to see if it's consistent Noc?
plane-crazy 2019-07-29 05:36:50 If you check in <#478584971670454284> , you'll see that he referenced that account as an alt, however, like I said, black background, potential for editing
plane-crazy 2019-07-29 03:23:40 Do it in <#384027830192832513>
plane-crazy 2019-07-29 03:23:36 <@!587393222855229457> , do you REALLY need to DM me about that? It's "!servers"

plane-crazy 2019-07-29 00:56:21 I'd suggest Thorium first, it's alot nicer, and it's one of the more popular ones

plane-crazy 2019-07-29 00:51:49 RIP
plane-crazy 2019-07-29 00:51:13 Well if it's an upgrade of the minishark
plane-crazy 2019-07-29 00:49:27 The mini/mega shark are rotary guns, sooooo
plane-crazy 2019-07-29 00:37:11 Well then, huh
plane-crazy 2019-07-29 00:34:20 <#490306593242611742>
plane-crazy 2019-07-29 00:32:38 Good luck painting your house with that
plane-crazy 2019-07-29 00:30:13 It's mostly IRL stuff trying to murder me with what I can only metaphorically describe as rocket powered chainsaws (Not literally trying to murder me), but yes
plane-crazy 2019-07-29 00:28:26 Sorry, busy developing something for a game, got IRL stuff, etc, <@!563785481570091037> , care to explain please?
plane-crazy 2019-07-28 00:25:06 He's one tiny bit from leveling up
plane-crazy 2019-07-27 05:37:26 You know what, I'm not getting involved in this, if Rick rages at you then so be it
plane-crazy 2019-07-27 05:36:56 <@!252094891448860673> , are you actually serious?
plane-crazy 2019-07-27 05:36:42 Really guys? Just, really?
plane-crazy 2019-07-27 04:21:28 But as it stands, don't do that, you just look like an actual asshole, and even if nobody's there to strictly ban you, you're still gonna be looked at as nothing more than a generic lowlife scumbag that most of society wants to burn off with a plasma torch, because that's the kind of person that knowingly does these things
plane-crazy 2019-07-27 04:20:16 Now, if you asked permission, and Dark agreed, you're allowed to copy whatever part he agreed to, so if you ask to copy the cockpit, and he agrees, you can copy the cockpit, and only the cockpit
plane-crazy 2019-07-27 04:19:52 <@!268493565548560384> , joking or not, copying is the absolute number one way to kill creativity
plane-crazy 2019-07-27 04:19:38 .......................
plane-crazy 2019-07-27 04:19:17 Is he the one copying?
plane-crazy 2019-07-27 04:18:08 Tell him copying is bannable and you already recorded his username for both Rick and Madattak
plane-crazy 2019-07-26 22:36:22 I mean, the whole point of SABOT rounds is to take advantage of the extra propellant to maintain accuracy
plane-crazy 2019-07-26 04:06:55 I *sorta* get what you're doing, but at the same time, come on
plane-crazy 2019-07-26 04:06:02 I'll just delete that, I swear if you do anything like that again though I'm gonna hang ya (not literally)
plane-crazy 2019-07-26 04:05:22 God fucking damn it dude
plane-crazy 2019-07-26 04:04:25 God fucking, <@!355123674954858496>  ......
plane-crazy 2019-07-26 04:04:10 Excuse me?
plane-crazy 2019-07-26 00:59:33 It's not Plane Crazy, it's studio
plane-crazy 2019-07-26 00:58:24 I had inspiration for it, but it kinda broke, yet that picture sorta helped, thanks
plane-crazy 2019-07-26 00:58:08 Trying to build a special fighter, so far I've done this as the front/head part of it
plane-crazy 2019-07-26 00:57:03 Hold up, that wing and fuselage pattern, <@!287233830576848906> , I think I've got the picture back again, thanks
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 22:59:14 Oh not in Plane Crazy of course, that'd just be mental
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 22:58:57 The thing I'm making? Probably not, but who knows
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 22:58:13 And <@!249373398612967441> , surprisingly enough you sorta nailed what I was making
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 22:57:59 I'm busy trying to make the fuselage of a special fighter, I've got no inspiration to spare for other people
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 22:57:31 Well I have no idea what to make then
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 22:56:45 Make this, but in Plane Crazy
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 22:56:20 Ah, ehhhh, I'd probably say it's not too much, although that's just my opinion
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 22:55:55 Too much in what way exactly?
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 22:55:35 ?
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 22:53:41 Oh there we go
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 22:53:30 I mean, I know they're a thing, but I don't have them, so RIP
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 22:52:59 And wait what you have server folders?
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 22:52:54 Mostly in-game, we can murder people in the server, but not in-game
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 22:52:30 I mean, how hard of a conversion is it exactly?
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 22:52:16 Yes, iron cross
No, you can't avoid rules
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 22:51:53 ?
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 22:51:53 It's because many people who boosted thought that would elevate them above the rules
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 22:51:02 Because boosts decay Turbo
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 22:50:52 The heck?
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 22:50:36 Baris, quite honestly I'll keep watch and see if anyone throws a fit, but as it stands, barely anyone checks pings, and those that do will notice a plethora of jokes there, so I don't think they'll think it's actually serious
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 22:48:16 And quite frankly Baris like I said it was a joke that every single fucking person understood as a god damn joke
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 22:48:02 Add a bit of fire coming from my mouth, but not straight firebreath onto whoever I'm destroying (In this case Baris), and it'll be accurate
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 22:47:14 Then get over it
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 22:47:04 Does that seem fair?
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 22:46:57 But until then, assume everyone realized it was a joke
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 22:46:44 And then I'll throttle Noc and everyone who was related to the joke
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 22:46:35 If someone says you're gay, or asks that, ping me
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 22:46:25 **Now then**, <@456226577798135808> , can you, **PLEASE** __***FOR THE LOVE OF FUCK***__ just drop it
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 22:46:04 ................................ Right, right right right, all of you, cut it out, leave it between me and him, talk about Entry Point or something
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 22:45:14 If it has gone too far then someone would've made a "BARIS IS GAY" statement at this point, but incase you didn't notice, nobody took it as anything other than a joke
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 22:44:24 Just, <@456226577798135808> , if someone is problematic, let me know, and I'll shut them the fuck down and beat up Noc for it, but until that happens, DROP IT, **UNDERSTOOD!?**
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 22:42:48 Now can you PLEASE just drop it, if it truly was just that problematic, don't you think I'd be blowtorching Noc by this point?
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 22:42:20 ............ <@456226577798135808> , if it well and truly has gone too far then people would be saying you're gay, but do you see anyone saying that? Plus if they do, you have full power to shoot it down god fucking damn it
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 22:41:07 God I'm tired now
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 22:41:03 Er, I mean bullets, soooo
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 22:40:54 And so far, even with the short mag, I've never ran out of mag size
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 22:40:38 And the F57 is better than the sawblade in everything except ammo capacity honestly
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 22:40:26 Now then, <@456226577798135808> , why the fuck, do you not get, that it was a joke, that anyone would get? If someone thought you were really gay, tell them "It's an in-running joke"
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 22:39:57 Right, before I get to that, honestly I don't find the shotgun useful, I prefer ARs
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 22:39:40 ................................................................
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 22:39:09 Mine's for both honestly
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 22:38:26 Honestly, I'm all-range with the CH-A
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 22:37:48 I've had bad luck with the shotgun then, because I haven't gotten the best of luck with it, one guy keeps on eating all the shots
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 22:37:18 I have an S97 for stealth, silenced and decked out, but not visible, meanwhile the F57 isn't suppressed, but it is concealed, and it's pretty nicely modded
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 22:36:18 And <@456226577798135808> , that isn't true, an offensive word, even if removed, is still highly offensive to a large group of people, their pin of the image was just a joke that anyone with a brain could tell was a joke
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 22:35:45 22 merc, 14 hacker, although I own a fully modded F57 and a CBR-C
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 22:34:37 Yes, I said I'm back
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 22:34:15 Entry Point, it's basically Payday 2 with more of a focus on tactics and stealth than blowing shit up
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 22:33:36 Also, Danny, Noc, what levels are you in there?
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 22:33:22 Right now I'm back
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 22:22:26 ................. Fucking, <@456226577798135808> , can you at least can it until I'm back? I need to go for a moment
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 22:21:50 I need inspiration for a fuselage
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 22:21:26 So just drop it and leave it be
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 22:21:16 Infact it's already unpinned god damn it
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 22:21:05 Just, fucking, I'll unpin it and I don't want to hear this again, if it's still going on I'm going to hang (not literally) whoever's continuing it still, got it?
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 22:20:32 Then why aren't I freaking out about all the memes people make about me?
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 22:19:52 And nobody would've because everyone would've realized it's a joke
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 22:19:42 Although I'll post this so you get an idea of what I'm planning for it to do later
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 22:19:26 And it's not a boat Battleship, it's the head part of a fighter
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 22:19:15 Noc took the joke too far while Baris not only got too insulted, but also reacted in a bit of an explosive way
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 22:18:30 Jesus fucking, <@456226577798135808> , just drop it, both of you were wrong in your own ways
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 22:16:14 JUST SHUT UP AND LET ME SCROLL BACK UP AND BE THE JUDGE, I already lost the inspiration already
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 22:15:43 And no I'm not interested in a battle now, I'm interested in fixing this battle, then getting the shape done, then adding details to it later, so no I'm not gonna add the neon thing yet <@456226577798135808> , but I am going to potentially add it later
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 22:15:09 This is the fuck I had to do to get it looking like that by the way
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 22:14:36 Giving this a fuselage at the back
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 22:13:54 I swear if I'm spending my time for nothing I'm going to god damn throttle someone, I was preparing to work on my build again after getting inspiration when THIS happened
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 22:13:15 .............................
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 22:11:15 ............
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 22:10:42 You can't edit other people's messages on Discord
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 22:09:55 The fuck is even going on here?
plane-crazy 2019-07-24 21:33:01 You can counter him by saying "There aren't even that many YT accounts in the entire world combined"
plane-crazy 2019-07-24 19:54:41 To get this
plane-crazy 2019-07-24 19:54:36 So, I had to do all of this
plane-crazy 2019-07-24 19:52:20 Infact, I could show you literally the entire thing
plane-crazy 2019-07-24 19:51:53 It gets worse, much worse
plane-crazy 2019-07-24 19:51:35 For an idea of what I'm working on (If you know about Roblox solid modeling, you'll know how much of an ass this is)
plane-crazy 2019-07-24 19:51:05 You know, I'm just gonna back out of this, I'm gonna keep on working on this thing
plane-crazy 2019-07-24 19:49:53 Furious I will fucking hang you ...
plane-crazy 2019-07-24 19:49:32 I mean something like this, except less flimsy looking https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/545451337261907968/602541091849240606/Capture_61.PNG
plane-crazy 2019-07-24 19:48:48 I can make it move easily (Well, not easily, but I'll make it work), but I need something aesthetically pleasing
plane-crazy 2019-07-24 19:48:30 In studio
plane-crazy 2019-07-24 19:48:23 Not in Plane Crazy
plane-crazy 2019-07-24 19:48:08 I need ideas for a mech neck, one that can rotate 90 degrees at least
plane-crazy 2019-07-24 19:42:21 Some last longer due to their severity
plane-crazy 2019-07-24 19:42:09 1 month, give or take
plane-crazy 2019-07-24 19:41:47 And to be honest 3 of those warns are expired
plane-crazy 2019-07-24 19:41:35 Noobing, I'm leaving that one warn in just because of that fucking comment
plane-crazy 2019-07-24 19:41:13 ...........................................
plane-crazy 2019-07-24 19:40:59 ?warnings <@438884464060399630>
plane-crazy 2019-07-24 19:40:56 Furious, why?
plane-crazy 2019-07-24 19:40:48 ........................................................
plane-crazy 2019-07-24 19:40:38 ..............
plane-crazy 2019-07-24 19:40:36 You said something else, that's what I'm warning you for <@438884464060399630>
plane-crazy 2019-07-24 19:39:55 JUST LET IT BE AND DON'T CONTINUE ON WITH IT, YOU IDIOTS SHOULD KNOW BETTER
plane-crazy 2019-07-24 19:39:44 <@456226577798135808> , I'm letting you off, but just fucking barely, I swear if this wasn't as confusing as it was I'd fucking throttle people
plane-crazy 2019-07-24 19:39:18 ............. You know what all three of you fucking, just,
plane-crazy 2019-07-24 19:38:58 I can look up the chat you know ...
plane-crazy 2019-07-24 19:38:18 Because I accidentally did a double warn
plane-crazy 2019-07-24 19:38:08 There we go, cleared em out, now then
plane-crazy 2019-07-24 19:37:38 ?clearwarn <@!479273717609005059>
plane-crazy 2019-07-24 19:37:35 God damn it
plane-crazy 2019-07-24 19:37:32 ?clearwarns
plane-crazy 2019-07-24 19:37:28 ?warnings <@!479273717609005059>
plane-crazy 2019-07-24 19:37:25 Fuck, hold on
plane-crazy 2019-07-24 19:37:18 Wait
plane-crazy 2019-07-24 19:36:45 ..........................
plane-crazy 2019-07-24 19:36:22 What the fuck are you two talking about?
plane-crazy 2019-07-24 19:36:03 .....................
plane-crazy 2019-07-24 05:33:03 Maybe you could, I don't know, make an actual joke? (Rude jokes aside though it is pretty hard to tell when some people are joking, namely on Roblox)
plane-crazy 2019-07-24 05:32:11 Oh wait that was a joke, couldn't tell
plane-crazy 2019-07-24 05:31:45 If we find out you're under 13 later though you can get in *serious* trouble, got it?
plane-crazy 2019-07-24 05:31:16 You certainly don't act like it, but I guess I'll take your word for it
plane-crazy 2019-07-24 05:30:49 And alright
plane-crazy 2019-07-24 05:30:43 **for legal reasons**
plane-crazy 2019-07-24 05:30:19 I need to ask for legal reasons
plane-crazy 2019-07-24 05:30:05 Question, how old are you?
plane-crazy 2019-07-24 05:29:53 ...... <@!401515741905420289> , you're kidding, right?
plane-crazy 2019-07-24 04:12:08 If you're being toasted by a gun turret, you've got a bad build, either amp up it's speed, armor or maneuverability and fight back
plane-crazy 2019-07-23 21:23:13 Honestly, this one of mine took about 2-3 months of getting inspiration, but 1-2 days once I got the inspiration and planning done
plane-crazy 2019-07-23 21:21:36 Then there's your answer
plane-crazy 2019-07-23 21:21:05 Why don't you become the first?
plane-crazy 2019-07-23 21:20:32 If you can genuinely make a Plane Crazy-like lunar surface, then I'll be impressed, but as it stands it feels like you just cheaply went to studio and did some stop motion
plane-crazy 2019-07-23 21:19:39 I mean, +5 points for the moon editing, -50 for lying and for being an edit, you need to make the sequence actually more realistic, and use the actual sounds
plane-crazy 2019-07-23 21:18:55 .... <@!401515741905420289> , We can tell it's fake, don't lie to us
plane-crazy 2019-07-23 21:18:00 First of all, space is a color role, second of all, there's no moon in Plane Crazy, people have literally flung themselves with literal infinite speed straight upwards and they haven't hit the moon, so you're obviously bullshitting us there
plane-crazy 2019-07-23 21:17:15 .... Uhhhh, what?
plane-crazy 2019-07-23 21:16:22 I'm still waiting for others' opinions on tandem charges, but with any luck it'll be inventor-worthy
plane-crazy 2019-07-23 21:16:03 Basically a functional use aside from just looking cool is my primary goal
plane-crazy 2019-07-23 21:15:48 Also I'm trying to open up inventor stuff honestly, mostly so people quit complaining about never getting inventor
plane-crazy 2019-07-23 21:06:52 Actually, hmmm
plane-crazy 2019-07-23 21:06:48 Ah, well still it's not that strong, it's gonna detonate all at once, try making a tandem detonation system
plane-crazy 2019-07-23 21:05:41 That ain't that effective, 1 TNT block is like 1 rocket
plane-crazy 2019-07-23 21:04:50 You mean a manually guided missile? In theory you can shoot down anything with one of those, assuming you can
1: Actually hit the target
2: Load enough payload on
3: Avoid getting hit in the payload
plane-crazy 2019-07-23 21:01:21 Then no offense but your english is very broken, and I'm having a hard time understanding what you mean
plane-crazy 2019-07-23 21:00:51 No to english, or translator?
plane-crazy 2019-07-23 21:00:32 Question, are you english, or are you using a translator? <@!450038814199775242>
plane-crazy 2019-07-23 21:00:13 Something like this, but less flimsy looking https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/545451337261907968/602541091849240606/Capture_61.PNG
plane-crazy 2019-07-23 20:59:29 I'm doing it in studio, so go nuts, I can probably shape it easily
plane-crazy 2019-07-23 20:59:18 I need an idea for a neck joint for a mech
plane-crazy 2019-07-23 20:49:01 The reason why rockets aren't pinpoint accurate is because that'd be pretty overpowered, as it stands they are **really** powerful in terms of damage
plane-crazy 2019-07-23 06:51:29 I guarantee you that magnets attracting to other vehicles is something alot of people want
plane-crazy 2019-07-23 06:50:10 No
plane-crazy 2019-07-23 06:49:56 Magnets don't affect other creations
plane-crazy 2019-07-23 06:49:39 It won't work
plane-crazy 2019-07-23 02:10:42 Check <#544022464133595166> and submit creations to <#504436696021204992> , a bot will automatically port it over, and no novice doesn't count since it's so easy to get
plane-crazy 2019-07-23 02:10:17 I'm probably gonna take a break, really tired here
plane-crazy 2019-07-23 02:06:35 That's Plane Crazy for ya
plane-crazy 2019-07-23 01:19:55 Hmmmm, I sorta had different ideas on how it'd look honestly, although I'd probably have to build it to show what I mean
plane-crazy 2019-07-23 01:17:01 It seems like the SABOT shell would actually catch with the round it's self, not to mention 4 delta 1X2s would slow it down quite a bit
plane-crazy 2019-07-23 01:14:32 Alright, let's see it?
plane-crazy 2019-07-22 22:58:25 Show us when you're done?
plane-crazy 2019-07-22 22:33:46 Basically the smaller it is, the better
plane-crazy 2019-07-22 22:33:29 That's an extreme example
plane-crazy 2019-07-22 22:32:13 By absurdly I mean like no 10X10 sized barrels, just for an extreme demonstration
plane-crazy 2019-07-22 22:31:53 Ah, yeah no that's already done multiple times over
plane-crazy 2019-07-22 22:31:45 Also *nsfw pfp!* (I know it's a joke by the way)
plane-crazy 2019-07-22 22:31:36 What do you mean? Like launching the whole thing?
plane-crazy 2019-07-22 22:30:43 Criteria <@456226577798135808> :
Must be affected by at minimum 9 magnets until it exits the barrel
Exterior must detach cleanly for an actual reason (Not just for show)
Shell must be stabilized forwards
Shell must maintain velocity
Must be able to reload twice (Fire 3 shells in total)
Cannon can't be absurdly oversized
Bonus points if you can load natural shells for a comparison

Do that and you've invented SABOT rounds in Plane Crazy
plane-crazy 2019-07-22 22:27:55 And honestly, if there's a SABOT that actually works, that'd be impressive
plane-crazy 2019-07-22 22:27:34 No
plane-crazy 2019-07-22 22:27:18 That'd be nice as well, but not needed
plane-crazy 2019-07-22 22:26:53 Wouldn't count
plane-crazy 2019-07-22 22:25:59 So I expect at least 9 magnets in a 3X3 pattern on the back to be able to affect it, because otherwise you're just lobbing an empty shell out for no purpose
plane-crazy 2019-07-22 22:25:24 You can't make a casing smaller than a 3X3 without loosing the actual middle section
plane-crazy 2019-07-22 22:24:39 Criteria:
Must be affected by at minimum 9 magnets until it exits the barrel
Exterior must detach cleanly for an actual reason (Not just for show)
Shell must be stabilized forwards
Shell must maintain velocity
Must be able to reload twice (Fire 3 shells in total)
Cannon can't be absurdly oversized
Bonus points if you can load natural shells for a comparison
plane-crazy 2019-07-22 22:21:55 I mean, if it works, it works, it's just gotta follow the criteria I laid out, and of course the pointy tip needs to actually face the enemy
plane-crazy 2019-07-22 22:09:44 If you could, a regular shell to be fired alongside it would be helpful as a comparison
plane-crazy 2019-07-22 22:06:17 I've already got an idea on how to do it with just a 3X3 area FYI
plane-crazy 2019-07-22 22:05:08 At minimum two pieces, preferably three
plane-crazy 2019-07-22 22:04:58 That's called Simple Planes, although Simple Planes costs money and doesn't have a working multiplayer (I think)
plane-crazy 2019-07-22 22:03:31 It detaches once it exits the barrel
plane-crazy 2019-07-22 22:03:21 The first challenge would be making a shell that can be affected by at minimum 9 magnets, while shearing off afterwards
plane-crazy 2019-07-22 22:02:14 One at a time, coaxial cannons aren't useful in modern day tank based combat
plane-crazy 2019-07-22 22:01:49 I already have a theoretical idea in my head, but I want to see what you all can do
plane-crazy 2019-07-22 22:01:08 I'm expecting magnets to simulate the barrel propulsion, at least 3 rounds fired (Aka: It needs to be reloadable), and I expect one of the diagrams shown for the shell, with a noticeable increase or maintenance of shell velocity once exiting the barrel
plane-crazy 2019-07-22 21:59:29 There is, it's called the rocket
plane-crazy 2019-07-22 21:59:24 Like I said, SABOT round
plane-crazy 2019-07-22 21:59:07 That's basically the design of a SABOT, but they're still pretty damn effective
plane-crazy 2019-07-22 21:57:57 Still no, that's been done before on other mechanisms
plane-crazy 2019-07-22 21:57:34 Nope, sorry battleship
plane-crazy 2019-07-22 21:57:11 More reading here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabot
plane-crazy 2019-07-22 21:57:05 Yeup
plane-crazy 2019-07-22 21:57:03 It'd actually have to use some degree of propulsion that mimics the actual reason why SABOTs are use by the way

plane-crazy 2019-07-22 21:56:01 A type of tank round
plane-crazy 2019-07-22 21:55:44 The only thing I can think of would be a SABOT style round that actually works
plane-crazy 2019-07-22 21:54:36 They're simply pistons basically, so yes, those were invented
plane-crazy 2019-07-22 21:54:10 Pretty much everything that could be invented possible was infact invented
plane-crazy 2019-07-22 21:45:58 Huh, alright then
plane-crazy 2019-07-22 21:45:42 The heck is that <@456226577798135808> ?
plane-crazy 2019-07-22 01:13:52 I'm trying to loosen up a bit honestly
plane-crazy 2019-07-22 01:13:28 And you're actually 14 and not just lying? Because it's legal issues you can run into
plane-crazy 2019-07-22 01:13:14 God damn it guys, why must you meme everything about me? (Not actually complaining, but still)
plane-crazy 2019-07-22 01:12:54 And <@!501093836765003789> , let me ask, and answer honestly, how old are you exactly?
plane-crazy 2019-07-22 01:12:33 Duhdoyduhdr
plane-crazy 2019-07-22 01:12:29 Terrains, use the wing panels to test it, then remove them once you're done
plane-crazy 2019-07-22 01:11:50 And if it's going that fast, well obviously it's going crazy fast
plane-crazy 2019-07-22 01:11:40 If it's going fast enough, those wing panels will generate enough lift to launch it into the air
plane-crazy 2019-07-22 01:10:44 And Terrains, make 1/50 or 1/100 parts wing panels, if it flies, it's fast as hell
plane-crazy 2019-07-22 01:10:28 <@!501093836765003789> , <#495286269459300364> , that's literally where "no u"s are supposed to go
plane-crazy 2019-07-22 00:02:29 Oh, sorry, I'm just a bit paranoid and, a bit infuriated now
plane-crazy 2019-07-22 00:01:46 Weren't you banned for something mateo?

plane-crazy 2019-07-21 16:46:37 .... <@!317775063845699584> , really?
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 04:32:30 <@!541363739253932032> , You do realize that that'd likely require a complete rework, right? It wasn't designed with a scale tool in mind
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 03:02:36 God damn it
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 03:02:21 **Really guys?** __**REALLY!?**__
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 02:51:48 I don't want an ending one like "The Queen", because that would leave no room for expanding
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 02:50:12 It's an ongoing phrase I've been trying to extend further and further, if you have any add-ons to attach to it, send em to me
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 02:48:18 Oh my freaking gordnfuckingbloodybenedictarnoldcumberbatch this thing is a nightmare, but I could see it combined for a split second, it looks **SOO GOOD**
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 02:46:08 It's a lighting effect

plane-crazy 2019-07-20 01:08:10 <@!592040876117590028> , tutorials exist to guide you to the creation of something in the simplest manner possible, if you can't follow a step-by-step procedure one (Which most of the ones we have are), then you aren't going to learn anything else from us
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 01:07:08 I use pings for 2 reasons, 
1: To get people's attention
2: To direct messages at people if I'm talking to multiple at once
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 01:06:44 Or, not
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 01:06:29 I guess he's saying thanks?
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 01:06:08 <@456226577798135808> , no it isn't
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 01:06:04 ............
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 01:06:03 Coaxial helis will help
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 01:04:55 ............. You do realize trolling people can get you permanently banned from all Innovation Inc games, including Plane Crazy, right?
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 01:04:10 How aggressive are you with it exactly <@456226577798135808> ?
plane-crazy 2019-07-19 21:17:26 At least not without making it 30 billion fucking parts
plane-crazy 2019-07-19 21:17:10 I need the ability to negate stuff to smooth it out, otherwise I'll never get the angles I need
plane-crazy 2019-07-19 21:16:26 Yes, even Astrocraft doesn't have enough parts for what I'm planning right now
plane-crazy 2019-07-19 21:16:18 I need a wider variety of parts than Astrocraft can offer
plane-crazy 2019-07-19 21:15:40 I'm more interested in just designing my own thing in studio
plane-crazy 2019-07-19 21:15:18 Meh, I'm not gonna participate in the contest anyways, sooo
plane-crazy 2019-07-19 21:05:48 Then how about unique military craft? Rather than F-16s and such
plane-crazy 2019-07-19 21:05:05 Why not both?
plane-crazy 2019-07-19 01:27:42 <@!318892614378061824> , I didn't fucking ban him, I can't show who, but it's not me, I'm remaining NEUTRAL ON THIS ya dum dum
plane-crazy 2019-07-19 01:18:26 Do not reach to me for comment on that, I'm going to remain neutral and not take either side aside from if he actually breaks one or more of the rules
plane-crazy 2019-07-18 21:04:12 I mean, I did make this as my second build in studio, sooo
plane-crazy 2019-07-18 21:01:35 It is my own <@!282630784928710657>
plane-crazy 2019-07-18 20:58:28 And I think you mean Astrocraft
plane-crazy 2019-07-18 20:58:23 Nope
plane-crazy 2019-07-18 20:58:10 It's not yet finished by the way, just wanted to show I was working on something
plane-crazy 2019-07-18 20:57:43 Whatever, you get the point
plane-crazy 2019-07-18 20:57:20 It's supposed to be a cockpit for a new fighter
plane-crazy 2019-07-18 20:56:33 It's actually in studio, just like my last one
plane-crazy 2019-07-18 20:53:57 Nah
plane-crazy 2019-07-18 20:53:03 Oh hey, what's this? (The background's just because)
plane-crazy 2019-07-18 18:36:49 I really hate games with semi-auto mechanics, for 2 primary reasons
1: More often than not they're unlimited or very rapid, so you can just hook up an autoclicker and go nuts
2: They're finger harm simulators basically, it's actually not healthy to click rapid fire on a pistol, even if it's more efficient in-game
plane-crazy 2019-07-18 18:29:36 71 shots in one instant, that's why I don't play games like that anymore
plane-crazy 2019-07-18 01:21:50 Lots of people in the VC
plane-crazy 2019-07-17 23:47:05 There's literally a game that's a running joke about border groups
plane-crazy 2019-07-17 23:45:20 They're desperate, let's face it, anyone using the ads are horrid
plane-crazy 2019-07-17 23:42:27 Give them a middlefinger and leave, all of them are nothing but garbage
plane-crazy 2019-07-17 23:39:35 Roblox military group?
plane-crazy 2019-07-17 22:42:37 I said "**if**" you can see in
plane-crazy 2019-07-17 22:41:55 Okay but seriously though guys, mod chat's supposed to be for really trusted people, if you can see inside of it, please don't leak it out to the average numbskull, they might take it the wrong way
plane-crazy 2019-07-17 22:40:45 Voxel! Damn it, that was supposed to tell if it was a joke or not
plane-crazy 2019-07-17 22:40:14 Say what number I just typed right now
plane-crazy 2019-07-17 22:39:27 Nope
plane-crazy 2019-07-17 22:39:12 How though? Like, seriously
plane-crazy 2019-07-17 22:38:36 Oh for the love of

plane-crazy 2019-07-17 22:36:49 ._.
plane-crazy 2019-07-17 22:36:38 Then say how much robux Super just bet
plane-crazy 2019-07-17 22:36:11 Are you actually in the mod chat?
plane-crazy 2019-07-17 22:31:34 Personally I would've bashed your face in with a warn for that one comment, but aside from that, not really much else, unless you really are causing problems
plane-crazy 2019-07-17 22:30:48 Probably because some members are waking up while others are going to sleep, no idea
plane-crazy 2019-07-17 22:29:58 Just leave it at "It's an ongoing problem of high debate"
plane-crazy 2019-07-17 22:29:25 <@!282630784928710657> , it's, long, and complicated, to the point where I'm not getting involved with it like I mentioned
plane-crazy 2019-07-17 22:27:03 I'm staying out of this by the way, so don't call on me for anything, and I mean that to both sides
plane-crazy 2019-07-17 17:54:53 To be honest I probably could nail it if I wanted to specialize a creation for it, I don't have the time though
plane-crazy 2019-07-17 17:53:50 I haven't, because I have a creation that doesn't even fit in the canyon
plane-crazy 2019-07-17 17:53:26 Also mouse controls
plane-crazy 2019-07-17 17:53:08 Meh, tiny creation, under 150 speed, not exactly the hardest
plane-crazy 2019-07-17 17:51:26 Go for it, let's see
plane-crazy 2019-07-17 17:51:14 Hmmm, you're allowed to post the video
plane-crazy 2019-07-17 17:50:57 Something like this tops out at about 600, and is pretty wide
plane-crazy 2019-07-17 17:50:37 With what creation?
plane-crazy 2019-07-17 17:50:04 We haven't, but if you're doing it slowly, it's not that interesting
plane-crazy 2019-07-17 17:48:14 Like doing a canyon run?

plane-crazy 2019-07-16 04:04:24 Just, DROP IT, AND MOVE ON FROM THIS
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 04:03:21 You do realize we're trying to halt arguments, right?
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 04:02:35 Anti, just drop it, we'll take it from here
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 04:02:21 .............. Right, can it for a moment, and let me explain, causing a problem, and trying to nudge it under the rug, doesn't make you innocent, so we still have every right to punish you for that, even if it's past, but not if it's already done
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 04:00:05 I mean a dumpster fire compared to how it usually is
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 03:59:36 I come back on and I see a god damn dumpster fire happening over here so catch me up on what happened
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 03:59:10 Right what the fuck's going on exactly?
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 22:31:40 How did absolutely NOBODY pick that up?
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 22:30:45 Oh you're fucking, ....... how'd none of you get it?
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 21:12:53 It just makes you seem really immature
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 21:12:45 It is actually irritating to be honest
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 19:47:01 Also hey, Terraria
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 19:46:57 Hey, a piano
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 19:39:00 ............
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 19:38:38 Because if we have reason to believe you're <13, we can all get in legal trouble if we or you don't take action
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 19:38:19 So, don't fuck with us, give us a good explanation, or please leave on your own accord and come back when you're over 13 years old
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 19:37:59 If you know why we're asking, "web.roblox.com" is the link that people arrive at when they're under 13 years old as per Roblox's standards
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 19:37:31 <@!351507429286215680> , explain
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 19:37:23 ...............................
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 19:37:03 <@!351507429286215680> , How old are you exactly? We need to ask due to Discord's terms of service enforcing a legal age for their platform
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 19:36:37 Right, let me just clear this up, hold on
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 19:36:17 We didn't invent lightbulbs without the knowledge of electricity
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 19:35:53 Then don't expect to improve
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 19:34:44 Then take our advice and don't just bat it to the side out of "stubbornness" otherwise it's that same excuse that'll tie you down
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 19:34:24 Certain creations are capable of being highly aesthetically pleasing while also functioning very nicely, but most creations focus in one or the other
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 19:34:02 Which, **WILL NOT** work, at least for most creations
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 19:33:50 You're trying to go for both, making it function while trying to stick with a theme
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 19:33:09 Golden, you've either gotta settle for function, or fashion, or if you make a custom creation, you can TRY to stretch for both, but you need a much deeper knowledge of the game than you currently have
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 19:32:06 ~~Steam release of Plane Crazy when?~~
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 19:31:45 At least on Roblox that is
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 19:31:38 There's various limitations that can't be overcome, and in this case, we're probably running at the limits of an aerodynamic physics based building game
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 19:31:10 Then feel free to make poor creations, both aesthetically and functionally, there's a reason we didn't have true to life graphics back in the 1990s
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 19:30:00 <@!271783384710250508> , you need to scale up to add proper detail, otherwise it won't work, I don't care what you think, keeping it to proportion doesn't work in this game, and that's a limitation of the Roblox engine mostly
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 19:28:53 And it would spin
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 19:28:47 <@!185912072658223104> , it is
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 19:28:35 If you're trying to make it proportional to your character as real life, that's not gonna work
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 19:28:14 The thing is, you need greater size to add greater detail
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 19:28:05 Golden
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 19:28:04 ...........
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 19:26:21 Third, make an ACTUAL propeller, it's large enough to support one, so why don't you do so?
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 19:26:11 Second, change the tail fin and extend the front, the tail needs to be an actual control surface
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 19:25:37 Right, first of all, scale it up, it looks like it's made of legos, and not the tiny intricate ones either, the giant ones babies use
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 19:25:02 NO WONDER IT DOESN'T FLY
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 19:24:50 What, the, fffff-
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 19:14:26 You have propeller blades in the wings section, you have motors, manually build one
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 19:14:17 Manually build a propeller engine
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 19:11:59 I've taken a break from Plane Crazy Burning, so sorry, but no thanks
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 19:09:52 <@!600401420587368515> , as you may or may not see in <#514788946140594196> , we've had a bit of an alt raid happen, hence why we're all on edge here
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 19:09:21 Fairly certain
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 19:09:09 Fonkl, he's not an alt, he didn't cause a shitstorm as soon as he joined
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 19:08:28 Anyways, welcome to the Plane Crazy Discord server, enjoy the madness
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 19:08:16 We're just laughing at how someone had caused a shitstorm and I tracked it back to their main account
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 19:07:58 Hello there
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 19:07:49 **HAAAHAHAHAHAHAAAAHHHHH**
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 19:07:32 Here's their mule account https://www.roblox.com/users/749194697/profile
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 19:07:22 This is the dumbass I'm sniping now https://www.roblox.com/users/169410004/profile
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 19:07:08 He tried using a blank mule account to join our server, but then he joined on his main account with stuff on it
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 19:06:40 PFFHAAAHAHAHAAAHHH, guess what the idiot did?
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 19:04:49 Meanwhile I'm going to snipe their Roblox account, and likely freeze their precious assets
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 19:04:18 It only takes a heartbeat to snipe them down
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 19:04:06 Fonkl, again, innocent until proven guilty
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 19:03:32 Innocent until proven guilty
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 19:03:07 HMW, what are you on about?
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 18:59:37 I mean, I TRIED to help them and to snap them out of whatever the hell they were thinking of doing
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 18:58:36 I already whack-a-moled them both
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 18:57:13 Oh for fuck's
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 18:52:04 Right, enough with this idiot
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 18:51:43 And I'm gonna ban you if you don't cut this damn acting
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 18:51:26 .... How is this harassment exactly? By asking you questions about what you're doing, when you're obviously bothering other people
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 18:50:49 If you REALLY want, I can show you true harassment, but I won't
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 18:50:19 Don't even start
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 18:50:12 .... <@!402133971040731146> , What, exactly, are you trying to do exactly?
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 18:49:19 .... "Why not", you're an asshole if you do that, that's why not
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 18:48:42 Then why are you butting into a random conversation going "shut up" "shut up"?
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 18:48:16 I'll start with the apparent problem, <@!402133971040731146> , what are you going on about exactly?
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 18:47:45 Right, break it up all of you, what's going on exactly?
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 18:47:30 The hell's going on?
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 02:02:34 What I want to know, Neutronium, can you make a homing projectile turret?
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 02:00:45 Probably a stress or variance test?
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 01:57:46 Minecraft scripting, specifically a turret
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 01:37:27 Even if you want to stick with a theme, super rockets are a good test to see what the behavior's like
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 01:37:04 Look, strap a super rocket on and see what the result is, if you pitch downwards still, your center of lift's too far back
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 01:36:45 That's not flying
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 01:36:04 Enqrises, I'm able to make 1.7K creations fly like god damn 300 block superfighters, I'm pretty sure I'm more qualified, are you able to pitch upwards golden?
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 01:35:05 Ballasts then? Check your center of lift as well
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 01:34:53 It's something that's really buggy
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 01:34:45 And helium doesn't count to your center of mass
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 01:34:39 There's 3 potential issues
Too much weight at the front, or too little weight at the back
Too little lift in the front, or too much lift in the back
Too much power up high, or too little power down low
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 01:33:36 You're probably pulling down when you do eventually somehow take off, correct?
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 01:33:18 You have too much weight at the front then
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 01:32:28 And if the back's heavy, then you're gonna tilt backwards, not forwards
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 01:32:16 Enqrises knows what I'm talking about
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 01:31:23 Then replace some blocks with helium blocks
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 01:31:01 Why don't you balance out the helium then?
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 01:30:21 I'd suggest using 0,0,0 TNT blocks to avoid any leftover parts, instead of disconnectors
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 01:30:10 Well, once you disconnect it that is
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 01:30:01 My suggestion: Lob it off the back end, or tie a GIANT helium rig to it, lift it up into the air, and see what happens
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 01:29:47 Nope
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 01:29:36 Also, enqrises, how can he get up 1K if he can't get off the ground?
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 01:29:19 That'd be nice, but hard to implement, think of how you'd get what you want
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 01:28:56 So you mean center of lift on individual areas?
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 01:27:22 Also, Neutro, if you can script that, alternate between a lead shot and a shot at the target, and you'll butcher whatever you target
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 01:26:52 You do realize that's called center of mass, right?
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 01:26:24 <@!238017332872478720> , give it a bit of a lead and that thing will be nightmarish
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 00:18:27 Doubly so on Roblox
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 00:18:11 A boat can carry alot more weight without having to worry as much about damage
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 00:15:39 People always beg that for whatever reason, no idea
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 00:15:14 <@!271783384710250508> , do you want help or not?
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 23:06:18 So you couldn't really read the rules, you'd have to recite them
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 23:06:08 That's why I said "in 15 seconds"
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 23:05:14 Time's up
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 23:04:56 General summary of 13 and 14 in 15 seconds, go
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 23:03:44 I seriously doubt you actually read the rules
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 23:02:58 Actually not the worst believe it or not
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 23:02:24 How about I drag you back there, so you ACTUALLY read the rules this time
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 23:02:13 That's why we direct you to <#533294912586645521> first, so you can't go "I didn't see the rules"
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 23:02:01 <@!471502263182032898> , we have <#495286269459300364> for a reason, not to mention you've been spamming the same stuff quite a bit
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 23:01:28 Right, why is there a dumpster fire here that I can literally see from a mile off (Jokes aside, what's going on exactly?)
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 23:00:58 Ahem
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 18:41:53 <@!249373398612967441> , **Ahem**
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 18:41:38 .... <@456226577798135808> , don't DM another NSFW message to another person, or else, got it? (You already did that once, and were banned for that)
plane-crazy 2019-07-13 22:32:24 We're testing Expanse now, feel free to join
plane-crazy 2019-07-13 22:10:07 What is it with these damn pyramid schemes roping people in
plane-crazy 2019-07-13 21:30:59 That won't work for a rocket
plane-crazy 2019-07-13 20:53:02 You mean a manual gyroscope, or just stabilization?
plane-crazy 2019-07-13 18:39:24 If you're wondering about people under 13 years old, we've been pretty thorough with that
plane-crazy 2019-07-13 17:26:38 Also, cap ships get DEMOLISHED by bombers, even though bombers are much bigger targets
plane-crazy 2019-07-13 17:25:54 Bombers have heavier "missile" weaponry, fighters are faster and have stronger guns
plane-crazy 2019-07-13 02:39:46 If you're trying to get it to walk, my advice: Walk yourself (No literally, get up and walk around a bit), and see what motions you do, what forces you apply, etc, then try to replicate it in-game as best as possible, and pay attention to even the most subtle of forces
plane-crazy 2019-07-13 02:38:39 Ultimately I'd advise to try to find out yourself, you'll actually get alot better and smarter that way, if you really want help, describe it as best as possible
plane-crazy 2019-07-13 02:36:03 <@!303637849650233345> , What do you need help with exactly?
plane-crazy 2019-07-12 03:16:08 Dude
plane-crazy 2019-07-11 14:22:46 It's a preemptive thing, somebody always forgets or, more often than not "forgets" and tries to cause problems
plane-crazy 2019-07-11 14:20:48 Well, I don't know, just don't cause problems in the VIP server and we'll be fine
plane-crazy 2019-07-11 14:19:20 Also, <#490306593242611742>
plane-crazy 2019-07-11 14:19:06 It's a server-wide thing
plane-crazy 2019-07-11 14:17:02 Okay who the fuck's letting unranked people into the damn VIP servers?
plane-crazy 2019-07-11 14:16:50 <@!402617794606399488>
plane-crazy 2019-07-11 14:16:47 .... Wait
plane-crazy 2019-07-11 14:16:31 And no I'm not <13 FFS
plane-crazy 2019-07-11 14:16:23 It happens to me to actually, or it did happen back in 2018
plane-crazy 2019-07-11 00:43:49 ?
plane-crazy 2019-07-09 19:08:42 I'm fine honestly
plane-crazy 2019-07-09 18:57:06 Well I think I know how to make a 3D printer, although it'd be very crude, and I'm not saying how
plane-crazy 2019-07-09 17:23:25 People have been asking for hinges for quite a while, however, there haven't been enough cases where they were absolutely necessary for hinges to be made
plane-crazy 2019-07-09 03:56:02 Ah, ouch
plane-crazy 2019-07-09 03:55:22 Why not you? You have the source material, the tools and (probably) the know-how
plane-crazy 2019-07-09 03:54:25 Or something again, better, but less memorable
plane-crazy 2019-07-09 03:54:11 Blast it out with an even better, but less memorable song
plane-crazy 2019-07-09 03:47:47 You've already been verified, Ro-Ver will auto-verify you if you've verified in another server
plane-crazy 2019-07-09 03:47:10 Wait, wait wait wait wait
plane-crazy 2019-07-09 03:46:56 <@456226577798135808> , what is it with you and eggs?
plane-crazy 2019-07-09 03:42:28 Go a step further and make a mecha-peter
plane-crazy 2019-07-09 03:36:11 Uhhhhh, <@456226577798135808> , care to re-read the rules? I feel like this would fall under rule 2 somehow
plane-crazy 2019-07-09 03:03:11 What's the problem <@!347918144062488586> , tracks keep on falling off?
plane-crazy 2019-07-08 21:30:16 Just take a screenshot of different blocks in water and that'll get rid of everyone's doubts
plane-crazy 2019-07-08 21:29:49 Fonkl, if you really want to prove it, do a buoyancy test
plane-crazy 2019-07-08 21:29:11 Life stuff, very very stressful life stuff that I'd rather not talk about, now what the heck's going on?
plane-crazy 2019-07-08 21:28:40 Right, what the heck's going on?
plane-crazy 2019-07-08 03:56:25 And ag- okay obviously alot of money was poured into the game to make it a sponsored ad, but what the fuck?
plane-crazy 2019-07-08 03:56:02 And again, what the fuck? (I refreshed the page)
plane-crazy 2019-07-08 03:55:08 No
plane-crazy 2019-07-08 03:54:58 I'd suggest not, seems suspicious
plane-crazy 2019-07-08 03:54:47 Yeah <@!435946988559925248> , you can bug the system by hauling out constant "updates", I've found games that have a 20% like/dislike ratio up there
plane-crazy 2019-07-08 03:54:21 How though?
plane-crazy 2019-07-08 03:53:52 Look at the sponsored ad
plane-crazy 2019-07-08 03:53:49 What, the actual
plane-crazy 2019-07-08 03:52:52 What the fuck?
plane-crazy 2019-07-07 05:32:13 Control panels Deciduus
plane-crazy 2019-07-07 05:25:00 Also g'night <@!429665143677255681>
plane-crazy 2019-07-07 05:24:54 Do it Legendary, they won't mind, and if someone's angry at you, tell them you had to go to the bathroom
plane-crazy 2019-07-07 05:24:29 This, ISN'T a damn joke, now cut it out
plane-crazy 2019-07-07 05:24:13 The, **FUCK** are you trying to do honestly?
plane-crazy 2019-07-07 05:24:02 ..... <@!508314435945889802>
plane-crazy 2019-07-07 05:23:55 Not Madattak
plane-crazy 2019-07-07 05:22:23 And if he somehow breaks through, I'm going to ask a contact to take further action
plane-crazy 2019-07-07 05:21:09 This includes the MC server, and any multiplayer server hosted by any member of the Plane Crazy community
plane-crazy 2019-07-07 05:20:42 Tell him he will be permanently banned from every Innovation.Inc game, and every subsidy of it, if he doesn't clean up his fucking act
plane-crazy 2019-07-07 05:20:17 ...........
plane-crazy 2019-07-07 05:19:33 Then find out who the hell it is, that shit isn't fine
plane-crazy 2019-07-07 05:18:41 Then how did they access the server, because Satan-kun isn't in the server
plane-crazy 2019-07-07 05:18:04 Was that you?
plane-crazy 2019-07-07 05:17:57 ............. Raptor
plane-crazy 2019-07-07 05:17:30 Must've bailed by this point
plane-crazy 2019-07-07 05:16:33 That's the user?
plane-crazy 2019-07-07 05:13:09 Thanks for the info surpee, I'm just combing over people on the player list (Yes, the entire player list of all online people) for who it could be
plane-crazy 2019-07-07 05:02:32 Did the person stop, or are they still going?
plane-crazy 2019-07-07 05:01:51 Don't, ping him, I'll ask him to make an announcement about it or something
plane-crazy 2019-07-07 05:01:32 Ask Voxel, but right now I'm trying to comb over potential suspects, at the very least get a reaction from him
plane-crazy 2019-07-07 05:00:09 The trick is, as soon as he/she/it looses focus, they'll likely have read the actions going on in here
plane-crazy 2019-07-07 04:59:34 Because we have an excessively toxic person in the MC server, and I'm combing over everyone playing MC right now to see who it is
plane-crazy 2019-07-07 04:57:41 AKA: His focus is in the server, and not here
plane-crazy 2019-07-07 04:57:26 <@285640703550423041> , <@!311996873650995200> , <@!302264107363598341> , <@!305196796278210571> , <@!434142224847208449> , <@456226577798135808> , <@!502014514880053249> , <@!268577499829633024> , <@!219915838193532928> , <@456226577798135808> , <@!339491942616268803> , <@!469290987286691860> , <@!414954293448146974> , <@!178767154785550338> , <@!276575595708809216> 

Who's "LegendOfCatBro"? I'm doing a role-call after we've had issues on the Plane Crazy MC server, and you're all suspect since you didn't check in, and he's still going on so it seems
plane-crazy 2019-07-07 04:53:55 Right, role call, if you're playing MC, say you're here, otherwise if I see your name on the list and you don't call, or the person leaves or goes afk and you say it afterwards, you'll be put on a suspicion list
plane-crazy 2019-07-07 04:52:43 IT IS NOT, FUCKING, FUNNY
plane-crazy 2019-07-07 04:51:43 ..... <@!508314435945889802>
plane-crazy 2019-07-07 04:51:39 ..... Right, role call, now
plane-crazy 2019-07-07 04:51:17 Plane Crazy MC server, it's a pseudo-official server run by Voxel I think
plane-crazy 2019-07-06 03:26:09 How bad was the quake Anti? I heard some people were getting a pretty bad one
plane-crazy 2019-07-06 02:30:17 Oh hey, <#490306593242611742>
plane-crazy 2019-07-06 01:54:31 ?ban 438102552953749506 Preemptive ban for sending a scam link in another server
plane-crazy 2019-07-05 21:46:12 RIP
plane-crazy 2019-07-05 21:45:33 WAKE UP DYNO
plane-crazy 2019-07-05 21:45:11 ?ban 438102552953749506 Preemptive banning due to malicious scam in another server
plane-crazy 2019-07-05 17:20:42 Rev your engine
plane-crazy 2019-07-05 17:18:27 I mean, Mega, it's the equivalent of throwing your sword, using it as a springboard, then teleporting the sword back in your hand in an uppercut-like move
plane-crazy 2019-07-05 17:12:50 That is actually pretty cool
plane-crazy 2019-07-05 06:24:06 It's a joke Rex
plane-crazy 2019-07-05 06:21:42 I doubt they can
plane-crazy 2019-07-05 06:21:28 @**AAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH**, that's my take on that
plane-crazy 2019-07-05 06:10:33 Oy, relax a bit King
plane-crazy 2019-07-05 06:07:54 Relaaaaax, I'm fine with being pinged, as long as it's not excessive
plane-crazy 2019-07-05 06:07:36 ?
plane-crazy 2019-07-05 03:58:59 Stridel, if it's easy to follow, and you're willing to take minimal credit for it, then it's tutorial-worthy
plane-crazy 2019-07-04 21:19:17 Thanks Grablador by the way
plane-crazy 2019-07-04 06:34:49 Riiight, now then, as I've mentioned, there is one grey area where copying is allowed, and that's with the explicit and guaranteed permission of the other user, if someone allows you to copy the wings, you can copy the wings, and **ONLY** the wings, not the fuselage, not the cockpit, not the tail, just the wings
plane-crazy 2019-07-04 06:33:32 You can be re-warned <@!373016548832444426> , and if we get another report that you're copying, **TIN**, after you've promised to cease, we have every right to permanently ban you, and every other alternative account from Plane Crazy as a whole, got it?
plane-crazy 2019-07-04 06:32:06 Tin, this isn't a matter of humiliation, it's a matter of being potentially banned you know, copiers absolutely **KILL** motivation
plane-crazy 2019-07-04 06:31:39 It still is on your record, expect people to be mad and secretive around you
plane-crazy 2019-07-04 06:31:18 Let me just get this though Tin, copying, without permission, is __***NOT***__ fine, under any circumstances
plane-crazy 2019-07-04 06:30:57 Look, copying's fine with permission, but if you do not get explicit permission to copy the part you are replicating, well, people get **VERY** pissy
plane-crazy 2019-07-04 06:30:16 It's not bullying, it's copying that's a major, major, **major** issue
plane-crazy 2019-07-04 06:29:44 .......... Mhmmmm, <@!373016548832444426> , Get the fuck over here, **now**
plane-crazy 2019-07-04 06:29:15 Alright show them here
plane-crazy 2019-07-04 06:29:07 Also, a "bit" more of a depressing topic but does anyone have any advice for what to do if there's a family member who can only be described as both psychotic and egocentric to the highest degree, who refuses to get help on their own right?
plane-crazy 2019-07-04 06:28:03 We aren't just going to make a giant mob and attack him you know
plane-crazy 2019-07-04 06:27:23 You're SURE he's copying?
plane-crazy 2019-07-03 19:32:11 4D shadow as in a 4D shape projecting a 3D shadow, or a 5D shape projecting a 4D shadow?
plane-crazy 2019-07-03 19:31:33 People have modeled what a 4d object, based on our understanding of dimensions, would be like
plane-crazy 2019-07-01 02:49:33 Hi
plane-crazy 2019-07-01 02:49:26 Crank it back before I have to start whack-a-moleing people
plane-crazy 2019-07-01 02:49:08 Ahem ...
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 05:44:21 If you want an idea on how large the ships are, turret mounts stay relatively the same size
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 05:43:46 Let's not forget the modded ships mind you
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 05:43:03 Falcon https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/starfarergame/images/2/29/Falcon_base.png/revision/latest?cb=20151127180809
Sunder https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/starfarergame/images/6/60/Sunder.png/revision/latest?cb=20170426030554
Dominator https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/starfarergame/images/3/3c/Dominator_base.png/revision/latest?cb=20151127175032
Doom https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/starfarergame/images/5/58/Phase_ca.png/revision/latest?cb=20170426205130
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 05:40:21 Hammerhead destroyer? https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/starfarergame/images/a/a3/Hammerhead_base2.png/revision/latest?cb=20170426032901
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 05:39:51 How about a Starsector Atlas instead? Similar size by the way https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/starfarergame/images/c/c0/Atlas_af.png/revision/latest?cb=20170426204456
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 05:37:10 This is what one looks like in the actual game it's in, with turrets https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/starfarergame/images/3/30/Onslaught_loadout1.png/revision/latest?cb=20180925122646
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 05:36:50 Yeup
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 05:36:32 Many of those circular things are turret mounts by the way
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 05:35:48 Starsector Onslaught? https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/starfarergame/images/6/6f/Onslaught_base.png/revision/latest?cb=20170426032101
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 05:34:19 You have full permission to call the recreation yours if you manage to make it by the way, well, as long as you acknowledge the source material
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 05:33:44 The one I made in studio, as best as you can
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 05:33:35 Legendary, try making the fighter I posted?
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 05:31:44 Still gonna just mash him with a hammer honestly
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 05:30:58 Can someone notify 7Spikes that they're going to be banned for a long while because they left to avoid the warn
plane-crazy 2019-06-29 23:14:28 
plane-crazy 2019-06-29 23:14:20 
plane-crazy 2019-06-29 23:14:00 Thoughts?
plane-crazy 2019-06-29 23:13:51 Sooooo, I finalized this
plane-crazy 2019-06-29 21:46:08 Well, of-age to be in the server
plane-crazy 2019-06-29 21:46:02 <@!454809803223465984> , welcome back to the server, nice that you're of-age now
plane-crazy 2019-06-29 21:44:59 Makes me think of something from Galaxy, I hate that game, but that ship looks really nice
plane-crazy 2019-06-29 21:10:48 Protagonist starfighter
plane-crazy 2019-06-29 21:09:31 I need color ideas
plane-crazy 2019-06-29 20:56:43 I somewhat enjoy how most of us are using text, just listening to the nice background music that hidear's playing
plane-crazy 2019-06-29 20:51:20 In other news, the thing I'm making is entering it's final stages, all that's left is to color it and add minor details
plane-crazy 2019-06-29 20:50:36 Yeup, in studio
plane-crazy 2019-06-29 20:49:41 Thoughts?
plane-crazy 2019-06-29 19:32:55 Hi
plane-crazy 2019-06-29 19:32:43 Made a brief announcement about stuff going on recently
plane-crazy 2019-06-29 17:33:50 Anyways, thoughts on the little spoiler on the thing I'm building?
plane-crazy 2019-06-29 17:33:31 **DAAAHHHHH X2**, okay but seriously though it is kinda funny
plane-crazy 2019-06-29 17:33:04 I saw that before you deleted it, daaahhhhhh
plane-crazy 2019-06-29 17:32:39 (Not in a mad way FYI)
plane-crazy 2019-06-29 17:32:29 Also what the fuck Danny?
plane-crazy 2019-06-29 17:32:27 Oh hey, what's this?
plane-crazy 2019-06-29 04:19:01 Starfighter, go for it
plane-crazy 2019-06-29 04:18:09 Niiice
plane-crazy 2019-06-29 04:17:55 Is that your tank?
plane-crazy 2019-06-29 04:12:00 You build big, then decrease size, that's how you cram tons of details in
plane-crazy 2019-06-29 03:52:14 Wrong, smaller or harder to hit targets, especially if you can vary the spread
plane-crazy 2019-06-29 03:50:42 I won't say anything else
plane-crazy 2019-06-29 03:50:38 I will say though
plane-crazy 2019-06-29 03:50:27 The game, whatever
plane-crazy 2019-06-29 03:49:43 Funnily enough it's definitely showing it's age, although I'm not really that motivated to use the Plane Crazy engine to build a new craft
plane-crazy 2019-06-29 03:49:09 I mean, it is based off of the Wyvern, which you know how combat capable it is, right?
plane-crazy 2019-06-29 01:10:38 Linh, you do realize that modeler's a pretty high one, right? I can't go on gut instinct, even though I THINK you were on modeler
plane-crazy 2019-06-29 01:08:14 If you recall any roles, or have a rolecard of your own, feel free to put it here and I'll fill em out again
plane-crazy 2019-06-29 01:07:24 I don't have a rolecard for you, sorry
plane-crazy 2019-06-29 01:05:34 Hi
plane-crazy 2019-06-29 01:05:25 And I did check, he was the latest one (At least based on server updates) who boosted the server
plane-crazy 2019-06-29 01:05:05 Yes, and yes Orangeskii?
plane-crazy 2019-06-29 01:03:52 Since a person who boosted the server got banned, I decided to make an announcement on it, just incase anyone else thinks similarly, feel free to read it
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 22:33:16 If he does have a mutual server with you, then RIP that
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 22:33:08 If he doesn't have a mutual sever with you, you can't send a message to him
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 21:32:34 Madattak+AS devs when?
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 21:31:49 Okay now I just feel like shit
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 21:29:56 I really don't have the time for Astro Craft
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 21:28:17 I'd imagine that's to get it maneuvering
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 21:28:10 "Energy melee" Cue gundams with space axes
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 21:27:33 It was like that in the old Space Construction game to, just these massive "oh my fucking god what is that level of detail" mega ships
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 21:25:34 That ship on the right though, those engines look so nice
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 21:23:25 Nah, I'm fine, my creativity's sorta gone at this point
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 21:22:44 Just, no, the level of detail on that is actually hurting my eyes a bit, jesus fucking christ, ow
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 21:22:27 Yeaaahhhh, no, that lost me right there, I was going to get into Astrocraft, but then I saw that
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 21:22:06 What the fuck?
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 14:20:44 <@456226577798135808> If I come back and hear there were problems I swear to god I'm going to beat you into the ground until you're sitting in a crater, got it?
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 14:19:39 ..... Ah, now I remember him
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 14:17:39 Nah, I'd probably be open about that instead of just a note
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 14:17:01 No notes
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 14:16:43 Mmmmmm, give him the benefit of the doubt though this time
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 14:16:20 People tend to repeat the same thing turbo
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 14:15:28 I usually make notes on people that have been banned before, basically on what they've done
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 14:14:56 I have a note on him ...
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 14:14:27 !!! __***FUCKING HOLD IT***__
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 14:05:03 I'm only checking in to see what's going on ...
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 13:10:22 I'm a fan of all things space, but should I?
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 13:10:14 https://www.roblox.com/games/679715583/Starscape-Pre-Beta#!/about Should I?
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 02:24:45 I mean think of how unfair it'd be if someone could just pay their way to do whatever they wanted in the server
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 02:23:47 While nitro boosting is appreciated, it doesn't elevate you above the rules
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 17:58:52 Not a problem, we just need to be a bit sensitive about it
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 17:58:16 Got it, we're trusting your word on this
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 17:57:26 <@227960066626551810> , Right, after reviewing his behavior, how you handled the situation and since your story is plausible enough, we're unbanning him, but be **SURE** he isn't actually <13, like I said, if he is, there could be legal issues
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 17:52:50 So unless you'd like to send your birth certificate or something (Please don't, really, please don't, there's a miasma of legal and seecurity issues that can arise from that), we can't gauge your age any other way, apologies for that
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 17:51:35 The only reliable non-invasive way we have of gauging age is the age inputted on the Roblox account
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 17:50:51 He's trying to ask on part of his friend
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 17:50:15 It said <13, sooo
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 17:49:11 If you can get a special pass for our server to allow people under 13 years old, great, we'll start doing so, but until we have definitive proof that they'll do so, we can't risk it
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 17:48:26 <@227960066626551810> , Right, let's get this out of the way, we legally can not allow people under 13 years old, or that we have suspicion of being under 13 years old, on our server, without major problems arising, we have multiple reasons to believe, and that show evidence of your friend being under 13 years old, so we need to enforce that, if you have issues with this, contact Discord, not us, because we can't go against it without the entire server potentially being shut down
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 03:23:15 Meh, well game's on my favorites, so join if you want
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 03:22:53 I know I invited some people over last time
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 03:22:41 We're running another test session, hopefully one more stable this time
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 03:22:28 Anyone remembered the Expanse testing I did that one day? Expanse Skirmisher?
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 19:24:14 King, gonna remove your old account if you don't mind
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 03:56:33 Not quite angered so much as just, FREAKING HELL
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 03:55:55 __***GUYS***__
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 02:06:39 We said it like 3 times, Astrocraft
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 02:03:57 Okay, now I'm tempted to start making stuff on there
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 02:00:52 Ah
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 02:00:37 Wait, question, are there actual weapons in-game yet?
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 01:53:35 I mean, it's better, just because Galaxy is Galaxy, and anything's better than Galaxy, right?
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 01:52:36 Meanwhile fighters got the shortest end of the stick possible and were completely useless
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 01:52:12 Back in the old game, I managed to glitch like 30 supersized reactors into one tiny space, but the problem was, even if I outfitted it with the largest weapons possible, people kept on building these giant meta builds for combat, or noob cubes
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 01:43:42 I'm slightly tempted to go at it and see what I can make, but I know I don't have the time nor patience for Astrocraft, especially after the bad taste the first game gave me
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 01:30:24 The tools are more complicated, but it's more or less just Plane Crazy without gravity or aerodynamics
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 01:23:08 At least back in the original game
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 01:22:51 I personally don't like it, namely because performance is heavily tied to design, so if you want an awesome looking craft as well as a high performance craft, can't happen
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 01:22:18 Yeah
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 01:21:35 Astrocraft
plane-crazy 2019-06-23 05:57:13 Might need to reload the save, or refresh it, it's a bug that Rick's trying to fix
plane-crazy 2019-06-23 03:44:43 *Yes for novice, you need to build a 5K+ part plane* **OF COURSE NOT**, ahem, but seriously though, don't make just a flying box, try to put effort into details
plane-crazy 2019-06-23 03:43:31 Read <#544022464133595166>
plane-crazy 2019-06-23 03:43:12 We're looking for stuff like these
plane-crazy 2019-06-23 03:42:46 Dude, Logavix, seriously?
plane-crazy 2019-06-23 03:41:22 Clutter I guess? Ask Voxel
plane-crazy 2019-06-23 03:40:40 Logavix, you need to have something that actually applies to the rank, not novice either, those tend to be too easy to get
plane-crazy 2019-06-23 03:39:48 I'm just gonna back out of this, you guys deal with this
plane-crazy 2019-06-23 03:34:31 I'm always available for pinging
plane-crazy 2019-06-23 03:33:20 Yeah it's only a week
plane-crazy 2019-06-23 03:32:35 We need to keep it secure
plane-crazy 2019-06-23 03:32:16 Look, the problem happened like almost, if not a year ago, someone shared the link, then it spread further through that person, over and over again, until we literally couldn't user the VIP servers anymore because someone kept on building a lag bomb creation
plane-crazy 2019-06-23 03:26:53 He's banned Imperial, you can tell because you can't see his ranks
plane-crazy 2019-06-23 03:26:41 Logavix, the thing is, people leaked before, and when people leaked, it went massively out of control of even the original person who leaked, which wound up bringing trolls over to the VIP servers
plane-crazy 2019-06-23 03:23:07 Juuust take care of this, whatever
plane-crazy 2019-06-23 03:21:57 Voxel, I can't tell if that's a complement or an insult, either way are you just going to let that be a norm?
plane-crazy 2019-06-23 03:21:11 Seriously? ... Right, <@!557172100545249281> , are you leaking the VIP 1 link, if not, then who the hell did? Because Logavix isn't ranked, and you need to be ranked to get in
plane-crazy 2019-06-23 03:13:18 .... Excuse me?
plane-crazy 2019-06-23 03:09:43 Meh, I try to be nice, but recently I've just been having a shitty streak
plane-crazy 2019-06-23 03:08:07 Ehhhhh, it's a highly recurring pattern though, so sorta just incase
plane-crazy 2019-06-23 03:07:40 Fuuuuuck's sake, okay but seriously, the last couple of people that I've seen that made "anti-furry" jokes wound up actually trying to harass some of the members
plane-crazy 2019-06-23 03:07:07 The last couple of people that made "anti-furry" jokes that I've seen tried to cause a f- you're kidding me ...
plane-crazy 2019-06-23 03:06:33 Ehhhh, I'll give you the benefit of the doubt for that one, but just let people like what they like
plane-crazy 2019-06-23 03:05:57 Oh
plane-crazy 2019-06-23 03:05:49 ...........
plane-crazy 2019-06-23 03:05:28 You do realize you'll loose more ranks if you leave, right?
plane-crazy 2019-06-23 03:05:20 ..... Veloci, come on, really?
plane-crazy 2019-06-23 03:04:59 I'm not warning them twice, just one of them
plane-crazy 2019-06-23 03:04:00 Look at the screenshots Voxel, this is in VIP 1 by the way
plane-crazy 2019-06-23 03:02:46 .......... <@!557172100545249281>
plane-crazy 2019-06-23 03:02:16 Yeup, seems like it, <@!557172100545249281> __***AHEM***__
plane-crazy 2019-06-23 03:01:56 Uhhhh, you know who's?
plane-crazy 2019-06-23 03:01:43 They aren't in the server I think
plane-crazy 2019-06-23 03:01:13 I think so? Depends how far they're taking it
plane-crazy 2019-06-23 03:00:33 ?
plane-crazy 2019-06-23 01:32:26 Probably in a bit
plane-crazy 2019-06-23 01:16:45 It's not bad
plane-crazy 2019-06-23 01:16:06 You need a rank to access the VIP servers, this is because most of the people that tried to ruin our servers were unranked
plane-crazy 2019-06-22 21:07:19 Er, VIP 2 then
plane-crazy 2019-06-22 21:06:57 Alright, VIP 1
plane-crazy 2019-06-22 20:58:42 Limitations I suppose
plane-crazy 2019-06-22 20:52:19 Oh, OOOHHHHH, I remember you, nevermind!
plane-crazy 2019-06-22 20:52:00 Other guy
plane-crazy 2019-06-22 20:51:50 Didn't we ban you or something?
plane-crazy 2019-06-22 02:47:01 <#504436696021204992> , it'll automatically get ported over to <#384025409945337856>
plane-crazy 2019-06-22 02:46:46 If you ever notice why there's 2 Infection Incs, apparently the second one's made by the original creator, while the first one was stolen by the UndoneBuilder guy, or so I saw on a sorta twitter war
plane-crazy 2019-06-22 02:45:50 I've actually maxed out on it, the guy's actually a pretty bad scumbag
plane-crazy 2019-06-22 02:19:18 So wait, are we talking about it can reload at any orientation, loads from the inside of the battleship, and lobs a shell of sizable proportions, AND doesn't occupy the entire plot?
plane-crazy 2019-06-22 02:18:22 Just wait for something new to pop up
plane-crazy 2019-06-22 02:16:52 Why DO you think it's so impossible?
plane-crazy 2019-06-22 02:16:46 It's a new mechanism, something that pretty much any creation can use
plane-crazy 2019-06-22 02:01:39 Other way around, not 200 or less
plane-crazy 2019-06-22 02:00:34 Well nevermind, freaking hell
plane-crazy 2019-06-22 02:00:17 Unless you can SOMEHOW make a magnet drive that occupies the same amount of space a beam does or something, and even then
plane-crazy 2019-06-22 02:00:03 And no battleship, magnet drives are likely done with by now
plane-crazy 2019-06-22 01:59:58 Also the super book Danny, and it cuts walkspeed by a half
plane-crazy 2019-06-22 01:59:24 99.9% of the time, "No"
plane-crazy 2019-06-22 01:59:12 Depends on the magnet mechanism
plane-crazy 2019-06-22 01:58:50 It's awful, threadbare, and to be honest it reminds me of one of those damn tinfoil scrap tutorial planes
plane-crazy 2019-06-22 01:58:28 PFFFF **HAHAHAAAHHHH**, you aren't getting inventor for that, fuck no
plane-crazy 2019-06-22 01:58:16 Want me to be blunt?
plane-crazy 2019-06-22 01:57:09 Presumably it's more parts
plane-crazy 2019-06-22 01:53:48 ONLY a single rocket engine as it's propulsion
plane-crazy 2019-06-22 01:53:36 Magnet drive still doesn't count
plane-crazy 2019-06-22 01:52:46 Motor engines count to you know
plane-crazy 2019-06-21 21:45:42 Well, happy birthday or whatever Seven
plane-crazy 2019-06-21 21:45:02 Sean, they are, it's just that I smell alot of BS, especially since <@263770097288609794> literally said this
plane-crazy 2019-06-21 21:43:17 I mean, Kayn, trains are pretty easy to control, plus they're mostly automated, double plus they're likely being supervised
plane-crazy 2019-06-21 21:42:44 ....... <@263770097288609794> , That's what I should be saying to you
plane-crazy 2019-06-21 21:42:25 F-18s are military grade jets for fuck's sake
plane-crazy 2019-06-21 21:42:01 Yeah no they definitely won't let you, unless it's a passenger thing, even then
plane-crazy 2019-06-21 21:40:18 It's just alot of stuff going on
plane-crazy 2019-06-21 21:40:11 .......... How is it spam SevenSpikes?
plane-crazy 2019-06-21 21:39:40 What the f-, <@!313930200939233281> , how?
plane-crazy 2019-06-21 21:39:22 Good for you, still a good idea to read up some more beforehand though
plane-crazy 2019-06-21 21:38:38 You're a pilot, "wow", just don't try to boast or brag about it please
plane-crazy 2019-06-21 21:38:10 Meh, let them be Katze, I smell BS, but there's no concrete way to disprove it, just don't go flaunting it around like you won the lottery or something
plane-crazy 2019-06-21 21:35:20 Look, if you REALLY are training to be a fighter pilot, good for you, now shouldn't you be practicing or something?
plane-crazy 2019-06-21 21:34:42 Took too long to respond
plane-crazy 2019-06-21 21:34:30 You Googled it ...
plane-crazy 2019-06-21 21:33:59 Okay, what degree do you have exactly?
plane-crazy 2019-06-21 21:33:17 Voxel, you take care of this, I know I'm oversensitive today
plane-crazy 2019-06-21 21:32:34 .......... Excuse me?
plane-crazy 2019-06-21 00:52:55 Imperial, modernize it
plane-crazy 2019-06-21 00:48:04 For the Wyvern fighters of mine, it's a massive up/down wobble that can be counteracted by decreasing speed
plane-crazy 2019-06-21 00:47:24 When it starts lagging, they start wobbling
plane-crazy 2019-06-21 00:47:18 It happens with all high speed crafts Imperial, I think
plane-crazy 2019-06-21 00:47:07 **GENERALLY**
plane-crazy 2019-06-21 00:46:51 Autosave occupies spots, and is generally only useful to those that have a common tendency to forget, or bad connections
plane-crazy 2019-06-21 00:46:34 RIPX2, well, designing it's the hardest part at least, building it's a bit easier
plane-crazy 2019-06-21 00:46:16 RIP Turismo, did you at least take pictures of it?
plane-crazy 2019-06-21 00:46:08 This is sorta why we blocked off <#507673335816126509> , because people kept on going "Increase plot size!" after we literally just responded why that was a bad idea
plane-crazy 2019-06-21 00:45:22 Not to mention people even now are running into the upper limits of parts, so you'd need to add more parts, which would allow people to make more lag, etc etc etc
plane-crazy 2019-06-21 00:44:52 Let me put it this way, this thing at about 1.7K parts already lags the shit out of my computer at graphics 1, and this doesn't even fill up the entire plot
plane-crazy 2019-06-21 00:43:55 Extra plot sizes is a really bad idea, for multiple reasons, even assuming it wasn't hard-coded
plane-crazy 2019-06-21 00:41:05 Super Cube Cavern, basically a reboot of the original Cube Cavern by the original developer, zKevin
plane-crazy 2019-06-21 00:40:13 So be careful using it
plane-crazy 2019-06-21 00:40:10 Problem is fall damage is a thing
plane-crazy 2019-06-21 00:40:05 It lets you shift your direction of gravity 90 degrees
plane-crazy 2019-06-21 00:39:45 Ah, it's the gravity rod, stick + super magic
plane-crazy 2019-06-21 00:39:24 Zero gravity?
plane-crazy 2019-06-21 00:37:19 The only explanation I have is that I've designed it very well
plane-crazy 2019-06-21 00:37:04 I wonder if I could actually RC fly both halves
plane-crazy 2019-06-21 00:36:55 Middle
plane-crazy 2019-06-21 00:36:33 I mean, I can literally cut it in half, flex-tape style, and it'll still fly, sooo
plane-crazy 2019-06-21 00:35:57 Ahem -coughcough-
plane-crazy 2019-06-21 00:35:44 Well designed crafts can still fly even with critical damage
plane-crazy 2019-06-21 00:33:19 Same with the shields, all 3 of them, regular (Don't know it's name), soul and demon
plane-crazy 2019-06-21 00:33:05 (Super Cube Cavern for those wondering)
plane-crazy 2019-06-21 00:32:59 I have no idea how to get the super book aside from the shop then
plane-crazy 2019-06-21 00:32:51 RIP
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 04:02:57 .... <@!257624380291547146> , You know there's this fantastic thing called <#495286269459300364> , where stuff like this belongs, right?
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 04:00:35 Please make sure it follows rule 2, we've had an argument spark up about something that was seemingly innocent before
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 03:56:04 Permission granted, request a duration
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 03:54:57 Anyways, Imperial, that won't work, he'll just flock to DMs ...
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 03:54:49 He probably squeaked it by right as he got muted
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 03:54:27 ..............
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 03:54:18 Now shape up and actually act like a decent human being who knows at least the basics of human social norms
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 03:54:00 Nobody will willingly help you so long as you act like a complete incompetent idiot
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 03:53:27 Just, if you're here to troll people, get out, otherwise clean up your damn act
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 03:52:50 I don't care what state you're in, don't bother other people
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 03:52:35 "Yo" you're not going to be back for long if you don't cut the damn crap
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 03:52:15 Okay okay okay cut the joking stuff guys
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 03:51:53 Riiight, <@456226577798135808> , cut it out, nobody likes a troll, and nobody likes an annoyance
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 03:51:08 Anti, tell him to drag it back to here, now
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 03:50:59 By "Hurt people", I don't mean physically, I mean like bothering thei- ......
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 03:50:30 If you're here to troll people, I'm here to break your face with a club, disabled or not, you don't get to hurt people
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 03:50:06 .......... <@456226577798135808> , Shut, the fuck, up, you can't use anything as an excuse, now cut the crap
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 03:49:02 Okay, <@456226577798135808> , can you NOT, seriously, it's annoying
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 03:45:34 And <@456226577798135808> , as long as you follow the rules, I don't care who you are or what you do
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 03:45:14 Raptor, show which one and proof of it, or name the creation and I'll CTRL+F and look for it
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 03:43:59 .... Who are you <@456226577798135808> ?
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 01:28:48 Don't ask Anti
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 01:28:12 But it's moreso grandparent, I adopted the parakeet and it's probably gonna have baby parakeets
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 01:27:49 I mean, in a way he's not wrong
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 01:07:19 .... Can I help you <@!249373398612967441> ?
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 01:06:44 I mean, there's a difference between spraying needlessly and actually spraying with aim
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 01:05:55 Well try taking me out with an M1 and you'll find a wall of bullets heading your general direction
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 01:04:47 I can't remember it, I do know that you could use resource points to build stuff down, such as spotlights and mortars
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 01:04:00 As soon as I saw movement, I aimed as close as I could get at them, THEN sprayed
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 01:03:39 Not quite spray moreso as a CWIS style of attack
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 01:02:58 I remember in one D-day game, I actually brought an LMG, dug into the cliffside, and literally, even before people started landing, I started just completely leveling them with the LMG, and all they could do was either run towards the oncoming death, or take potshots at me, which never really hit
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 00:58:33 Alright, what about someone with an aimbot? I've seen people spinning around like fucking heli rotors  wielding a sniper, just nailing headshot after headshot
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 00:57:03 How do you beat someone when they literally have 4X as much health compared to you, and the same exact weaponry?
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 00:56:11 <@!249373398612967441> , try saying that when YOU find a fun game and consistently you keep on finding people hacking it to hell and back
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 00:55:22 It's exploiter hell currently, I'm seeing people with upwards of 600 FUCKING HEALTH
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 00:54:27 There's a reason we use guns instead of knives in a war
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 00:53:54 It's the whole thing about range
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 00:53:47 https://www.roblox.com/games/3233893879/Bad-Business-Prototype-1-7-0
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 00:53:44 Bad Business
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 00:53:36 Nah, melee's fine where it is to be honest
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 00:53:23 AK was nerfed
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 00:53:18 Actually, 51 kills, 0 deaths
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 00:51:40 You get about a 3 second I-frames when you spawn, which HASN'T screwed me over yet, it nearly did though
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 00:49:55 Yeup
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 00:49:54 From a 13 KDR down to a .8 KDR before the game ended
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 00:49:29 I still remember when I called someone out for aimbotting, and their aim dropped like a god damn rock
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 00:47:38 Plus smaller servers means smaller teams, and funnily enough I do worse in smaller servers than in bigger servers, even though there's more people shooting at me, probably because there's more people for them TO shoot
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 00:47:08 ................. <@!249373398612967441> , Check again
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 00:46:29 Ahem -cough-, as shown by here, back when it was KOTH
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 00:46:01 But yeah, give me cover, a decently accurate full auto gun, or keep them off of me, and I just tear people to pieces
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 00:45:25 Nah, stationary MGs are too easy to camp
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 00:45:04 Exceeeept when flanked or sniped
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 00:44:47 If you have EVER seen me  at LMG point defense, I'm just a god damn brick wall to face
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 00:44:27 Not really
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 00:44:07 To be honest, I just want an LMG
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 00:43:29 Or, on par I think, I'm not sure
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 00:43:20 Like, the silenced pistol's faster now
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 00:43:04 And it got nerfed PRETTY hard
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 00:42:58 It's RoF got nerfed
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 00:42:55 Not fast enough to out-dps a CQC brawl, not powerful enough to kill a sniper
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 00:42:34 To be honest few people use the AK these days, I'm guessing because it's the uncomfortable middleman that nobody ever uses
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 00:42:07 As is the revolver
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 00:41:56 Magnum, whatever it is
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 00:41:46 I like it, it's decent, but it's kinda just a slightly better version of the revolver
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 00:41:12 The semi-auto rifle?
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 00:40:38 Not to survive another headshot afterwards and snipe my face
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 00:40:23 I expect people with 150 health to die in 3 shots of a 50 damage pistol
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 00:39:51 Even with these hackers though I tend to get about a 6-7KDR (The new Vector does about 20 damage per shot, not FUCKING 50)
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 00:38:54 Like seriously, there's unobserved quantum matter that's less twitchy than the idiots who think a snap aimbot's not a dead giveaway
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 00:37:53 Also, twitchiness signifies aimbot, especially if they use pinpoint weapons at point blank, and fentanyl's a drug that can be snuck into regular drugs to make them far more addictive, and far more deadly, and since withdrawl commonly has shaking, take a guess what I'm talking about there
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 00:37:08 Because people abuse votekicks all the time
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 00:36:59 Hell, the most hilarious one was some guy shooting backwards, moonwalking
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 00:36:31 While it's hard to do so, I am really sick of the hacks in-game, especially since some people are twitchier than pure fentanyl users
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 00:34:58 Like 1200 health, noped out by a single shotgun burst, like what the fuck? That doesn't happen
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 00:34:27 By the way, shotgun snipers are back ... our entire team was literally dropped in one burst by a shotgun, 7-8 people
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 00:33:43 If they were lagging they wouldn't have a 20 KDR, and they'd drop dead about 4-5 seconds later
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 00:33:10 Since I don't know, but one thing's for certain, 150 health ain't getting you past 225 damage, and I keep on seeing people survive upwards of 300 damage, only to return fire
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 00:32:09 As I've happily found out using the revolver, there are still people that grossly hack their health to absurd values (4 damage markers, 1 was a headshot, no kill, the revolver's basicaly the old M1911, except with a much smaller mag size)
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 19:49:10 Just get as many kills as possible during those waves, and maybe stay with high levels
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 19:46:53 For secondary, either get the Serbu if you REALLY need a useful secondary right now, or go for the TEC-9
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 19:46:23 Then KAC PDW, then M1 Garand
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 19:45:49 I'd personally suggest the Sten MK5
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 19:44:31 Let me check Kip
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 19:37:55 Depends, are you able to make a proper stand yourself?
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 19:35:36 Pretty sure there's something else there, though I can't remember what I picked
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 19:35:06 I went double barrel, grease gun, M1 Garand, AK-47, RPK for primaries
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 19:32:24 And DON'T leak the VIP server link, every time that happened, shortly afterwards we've had an influx of trolls try to ruin it for everyone
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 19:32:03 <@!518187868347170818> , Done, please no bad suggestions, think of how it'd work and everything about it
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 19:30:46 And post a picture of it doing whatever you want if it's something like carrier commando or something
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 19:30:22 Actually, post a full uncropped picture of both your creation and the block count, then state the rank you want
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 19:29:19 I tend to be the last one surviving, even when there was a level 87 in the server, sooo
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 19:28:33 I'd actually stay on the AK-47 just purely because of the reload time (Also the optics are annoying), but it doesn't have enough ammo, nor deal enough damage
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 19:27:57 I got the RPK recently, and hooohhhh boy the reload time's a doozy
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 19:27:44 33, 34, somewhere around there last I checked
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 19:27:07 Get a rank from <#544022464133595166> , novice won't count because it's too easy to get them, and do "&suggest (Suggestion)" in <#384027830192832513>
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 19:26:43 Don't you ask that on a freaking daily basis?
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 19:26:28 Wait till you see the bloats, those things FUCKING __***SUCK***__
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 19:26:11 Bypasses armor to
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 19:26:01 They leave a cloud of spores or something, so basically acid
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 19:25:34 Because you can keep on-pace with the zombies, with the old round 10, they were slightly faster than you
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 19:25:16 Round 15 now (Discluding the bursters, because fuck those things) is actually easier than the old round 10, back when it ended at round 10
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 19:24:03 Not even then, too risky due to run speed
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 19:23:10 I only use it on the first few waves as a joke to play whack-a-mole with as many zombie heads as possible
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 19:22:23 Also can we just agree that melee is worthless aside from a joke?
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 19:21:36 To be honest, if you're firing anything at full auto, either you've fucked up and got cornered, or are wasting ammo
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 19:20:42 Hey, I have a potential baby bird coming very soon so what do you expect!?
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 19:19:56 It is, https://twitter.com/birbb/status/1117943947400228865
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 19:19:28 Isn't that a snippit of a quick video?
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 19:18:35 Ah
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 19:17:52 Grablador, I'd also suggest the TEC-9, think Grease Gun, but semi-auto, and with alot more ammo
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 19:17:18 Yeah, only PVE
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 19:17:14 Wave based zombie survival that is actually pretty difficult in the end
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 19:17:05 PVE
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 19:17:04 Reach for the M1 Garand, it's a godsend, be sure to reload early to avoid having to draw the bolt (Except for the Garand, in which case it's faster to empty the mag), and always keep an eye on ammo
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 19:16:20 Like, mag size in Those Who Remain's not a problem for me, it's how much SPARE ammo there is
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 19:15:57 Everything else I know I'd run outa ammo WAY too fast for it to be useful, they really need to make the amount of spare mags known
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 19:15:36 TEC-9's pretty damn good, so far the only replacement candidate is the CBJ gun thing, and that one has slightly less damage for more firerate and more ammo (Presumably it's full auto)
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 19:14:45 What, in Those Who Remain?
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 07:02:51 Fucking sleep then battleship! Get as much as you can, now goodnight
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 07:02:07 FFS, I'm going to assume best case scenario and say it actually was that number, carry on
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 07:00:59 Please tell me you're kidding me <@!386974424538152960> , or that it's ACTUALLY that and not a joke
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 05:17:21 Was that a tiny gecko thing Spy?
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 01:11:41 That is fucking morbid as hell
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 01:03:24 Considering the girl budgie trusts me alot (To the point where I can hold her and she literally won't mind), I feel like biting's not going to be an issue if I do wind up having to throw it out
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 00:58:57 I'm googling as hard as I can, and yes there's a male
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 00:58:27 __***LOOK!***__
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 00:58:18 Uhhhh, quickly, bit of a surprise came around, anyone know how to take care of budgie eggs?
plane-crazy 2019-06-16 19:46:15 Check <#537387562126278656>
plane-crazy 2019-06-16 19:46:09 The one Madattak was playing
plane-crazy 2019-06-16 19:45:24 Do I win? My score literally isn't going any higher, even when I try to bump it past the safety thresholds temporarily
plane-crazy 2019-06-16 19:38:01 The tiiiiny fluctuations in the AC generator and turbine are enough to drag them into warning territory (Which is bad), but tweaking them slightly fixes it
plane-crazy 2019-06-16 19:37:10 Playing the game Madattak was on, have to micromanage it to fuck (Paused it so I could actually take the screencap), but I got this
plane-crazy 2019-06-16 18:56:32 ..... Empire I am not in the mood for these damn antics, so can you NOT
plane-crazy 2019-06-16 18:56:04 Whatever Imperial, you get the point, also Empire, not every single damn person knows
plane-crazy 2019-06-16 18:55:16 Biplanes were actually used during WWII, infact they were used to sink the Bismark
plane-crazy 2019-06-16 18:54:42 It's definitely too small for planes to be honest, aside from airstrikes or something
plane-crazy 2019-06-16 18:52:33 Honestly I don't give a fuck about the version as long as it runs good
plane-crazy 2019-06-16 18:51:34 9.1's run by Wingman8, 9.5's supposedly run by a guy who helped 9.0 and 9.1
plane-crazy 2019-06-16 18:49:18 Empire, I'm the kind of person that actually gets people reformed
plane-crazy 2019-06-16 18:48:58 And you'll follow them to Furious if you don't drop it
plane-crazy 2019-06-16 18:48:43 Like I said, god damn hair trigger ...
plane-crazy 2019-06-16 18:47:56 Welp
plane-crazy 2019-06-16 18:47:54 Oh
plane-crazy 2019-06-16 18:47:41 ..... What I see is a giant box of "parental advisory" or something
plane-crazy 2019-06-16 18:47:14 What even is in his PFP?
plane-crazy 2019-06-16 18:45:42 .......... Let me just mention, quit acting like a fucking asshole, I'm not in a good mood today, and I will throw out warns with a damn hair trigger if you fuck up today
plane-crazy 2019-06-16 18:44:26 <@!589657946082770984> , really?
plane-crazy 2019-06-16 18:44:09 ........
plane-crazy 2019-06-16 18:44:05 Furious, can I **HELP** you!? I'm not having a good day
plane-crazy 2019-06-16 18:43:13 Don't act dumb
plane-crazy 2019-06-16 18:42:25 ?clearwarn <@!589657946082770984>
plane-crazy 2019-06-16 18:42:19 .... Wait there was a double
plane-crazy 2019-06-16 05:27:35 I'm indifferent to this, and aren't bothered by your rejoining, but I can't say the same for the other mods/admins
plane-crazy 2019-06-16 02:58:40 Looks like game night's starting up again, at least an improptu one
plane-crazy 2019-06-16 02:45:41 I'd imagine the lift is far too far in the back to actually fly, considering I tried introducing a friend to this, and even with the center of lift barely in the back, he pitched downwards too hard to lift up
plane-crazy 2019-06-16 02:41:54 Uhhhhh, can that, even fly?
plane-crazy 2019-06-16 00:03:23 ......
plane-crazy 2019-06-14 23:53:05 Suggestive as hell at least
plane-crazy 2019-06-14 23:52:57 Basically
plane-crazy 2019-06-14 23:52:45 I banned the guy for 10 minutes so he/she could change their PFP
plane-crazy 2019-06-14 19:50:37 Balance out flotation with helium and ballasts, then use very minor amounts of engines to tweak it the final way
plane-crazy 2019-06-14 19:48:41 ..... Can I help you <@!438097723598569472> ?
plane-crazy 2019-06-14 19:48:17 Settings and/or drive the damn thing there
plane-crazy 2019-06-14 06:54:12 Depends
plane-crazy 2019-06-14 06:50:55 Or is it heat treating? Dunno
plane-crazy 2019-06-14 06:50:47 Fire treating's a legitimate thing, dunno how it works, but it makes the object, which is normally quite flammable (Such as wood or curtains), pretty heat resistant, at least compared to their non-treated counterparts
plane-crazy 2019-06-14 06:50:18 Imperial, ram first, doesn't matter how badly you'd want Minecraft to run if you don't have the space for it
plane-crazy 2019-06-14 06:50:02 Fire treated wood?
plane-crazy 2019-06-14 06:48:10 Sounds like something I'd want, I'm currently on RPK/Tec-9 (Tec's actually pretty damn amazing in-game if you know how to tap-fire it properly), and the RPK's punchy, but the reload sucks
plane-crazy 2019-06-14 06:47:29 What's the ammo count like?
plane-crazy 2019-06-14 06:47:25 Nice
plane-crazy 2019-06-14 06:47:14 You actually got the flamethrower in-game?
plane-crazy 2019-06-14 03:02:01 I only do the very first steps of tutorials, mostly to get my self situated on the handling, and to learn any interesting mechanics
plane-crazy 2019-06-14 03:00:21 If you have to read a tutorial, you won't learn anything
plane-crazy 2019-06-14 02:59:05 I could probably make an even numbered fighter if I wanted to, but 
1: I have no inspiration (Don't push it, I get inspiration on my own)
2: I have no drive to do so
plane-crazy 2019-06-14 02:58:16 Even numbered width isn't THAT bad, you just need to know how to work with it
plane-crazy 2019-06-14 00:04:18 SCRAM drive? Basically a hyperdrive, but much stronger and random?
plane-crazy 2019-06-13 23:46:07 I play it, I've got an RPK
plane-crazy 2019-06-13 22:35:52 It's like an angry dog or something, just goes mental
plane-crazy 2019-06-13 22:35:18 Well add more anchored restraints on it, see how it treats that
plane-crazy 2019-06-13 22:33:51 Contain it in a magnet field or something
plane-crazy 2019-06-13 22:33:34 Jesus, that thing just goes berserk
plane-crazy 2019-06-13 19:50:58 Done
plane-crazy 2019-06-13 19:40:27 Alright fair you can pass, but don't ping him unless it's important, AND it's something only he can do, such as giving exclusive items
plane-crazy 2019-06-13 19:39:57 I'm assuming he didn't receive some items, so I suppose that is a legitimately a reason to ping Rick, since Rick or Madattak are the only 2 that can adjust that, and since Madattak's kinda strictly off limits unless it's absolutely completely vitally important
plane-crazy 2019-06-13 19:39:27 Oh, well, uhhh, hmmmm
plane-crazy 2019-06-13 19:39:02 .......
plane-crazy 2019-06-13 19:38:57 .... <@!199178692847468545> , Exactly WHAT is so important, that you need to ping Rick for it, because spoilers: It's probably not that important
plane-crazy 2019-06-13 19:38:21 <@!199178692847468545>
plane-crazy 2019-06-13 19:38:18 Just what's so important that you need to ping Rick for it
plane-crazy 2019-06-13 19:37:58 For fuck's, <@!199178692847468545> , READ THE RULES god damn it
plane-crazy 2019-06-13 19:37:48 Oh so you get special permission Empire and yet I don't ...
plane-crazy 2019-06-13 19:36:26 <@!351809528209080324> , You aren't helping, and no <@456226577798135808> , it's not allowed, for reasons that SHOULD BE FUCKING OBVIOUS TO ANYONE WITH MORE BRAINCELLS THAN THE AVERAGE IQ
plane-crazy 2019-06-13 19:35:44 Fucking hell, just, fucking hell .....
plane-crazy 2019-06-13 19:34:55 Do I even need to say it? Are you honestly really that bad at basic processing of human norms?
plane-crazy 2019-06-13 19:21:55 <@456226577798135808> , Are you seriously not even trying to read the rules at this point?
plane-crazy 2019-06-13 19:21:34 ......
plane-crazy 2019-06-13 18:58:56 It's really hard to moderate non-english languages, so could you please stick to english damn it
plane-crazy 2019-06-13 18:58:36 <@456226577798135808> , rule 10
plane-crazy 2019-06-13 18:58:21 Wait till you see the shit I've had to deal with Nuclear
plane-crazy 2019-06-13 18:58:01 That's not an excuse
plane-crazy 2019-06-13 18:57:46 ................
plane-crazy 2019-06-13 18:57:30 Also <@456226577798135808> , if you know you're toxic, then quit being toxic
plane-crazy 2019-06-13 18:57:20 The only result I got is this https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerastes_cerastes
plane-crazy 2019-06-13 18:56:26 What snake has horns exactly?
plane-crazy 2019-06-13 18:55:33 My PFP's just a dragon, nothing more, nothing less
plane-crazy 2019-06-13 18:52:34 I was away for a long while, don't judge the delayed response
plane-crazy 2019-06-13 05:56:16 Because you've got a bigger rocket Empire, that's why
plane-crazy 2019-06-13 05:55:45 So basically it's a rocket tycoon sort of game?
plane-crazy 2019-06-13 05:55:37 Ah
plane-crazy 2019-06-13 05:55:06 What game is that Empire?
plane-crazy 2019-06-13 05:54:16 Bad Business, a new Rudimentality thing
plane-crazy 2019-06-13 05:54:09 And I CAN NOT find out what the tie-in is
plane-crazy 2019-06-13 05:53:53 Admittedly I have no idea what makes me tick, sometimes I'm a god of destruction, other times I'm about average
plane-crazy 2019-06-13 05:53:27 -Cough cough-
plane-crazy 2019-06-13 02:18:02 Especially that double shot in the end
plane-crazy 2019-06-13 02:17:14 Well that was fun, sorry about the twin snipes Turismo
plane-crazy 2019-06-13 01:18:08 It's been so long since I played Armored Patrol, I'd honestly be too rusty at it
plane-crazy 2019-06-13 01:15:03 Alright
plane-crazy 2019-06-13 01:14:36 This one https://www.roblox.com/games/2405063379/RELEASED-Super-Cube-Cavern-Beta
plane-crazy 2019-06-13 01:14:13 Cube Cavern
plane-crazy 2019-06-13 01:14:11 Not Dungeon Quest
plane-crazy 2019-06-13 01:13:33 Although chests aren't worthwhile
plane-crazy 2019-06-13 01:13:26 There's tons of stuff here by the way
plane-crazy 2019-06-13 01:10:22 <@!238825322508845056> , I'm already in another dungeon if you wanna follow along
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 21:38:06 The only time I do that is when we've literally pushed them right to their spawn
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 21:36:39 Meanwhile nobody captures the center point and whoever's trying to do a sniper squad looses
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 21:35:21 150 health vs 3X50 + however much damage the shotgun did
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 21:34:46 I found a guy in Bad Business that took 1 shotgun burst, and more than 3 pistol shots to kill ... What is it with people hacking their health and thinking they're smart?
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 21:21:08 150 health, 100X1.5=150, they'd be dead as a can of spam if playing legitimately
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 21:20:42 Yeah no definitely an exploiter then, I've seen people that don't die from a single sniper headshot, which IS an insta-kill
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 21:19:40 Don't forget regen's a thing
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 21:19:32 Aka: I dealt 150 damage, but he had more than 150 health
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 21:19:17 They definitely deal 100 damage, even from one corner of the map to the other, probably someone exploiting, I've dealt more than 150 damage to people, and someone else comes up and mops them up, the kill thing says I dealt 150 damage though
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 21:17:26 Takes 5 shots to kill a sniper, 3 for the pistol
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 21:17:14 Nah, I've sniped snipers with the pistol and AR, I think I'm actually talking about the max dropoff
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 21:14:31 AR does 30 damage, semi-auto does 60, shotgun does who knows how much, sniper does 100, pistol does 50, knife does 75, silenced I think does 40, 45? Not sure, damage is X1.5 per headshot
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 21:02:51 I know I'm guilty of using both the shotgun and AR in CQC fights, namely when one ran out I'd swap to the other
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 20:59:21 If you joined literally yesterday though, loadouts wouldn't be a thing, and you could've used every weapon (Albeit a weaker shotgun) at any point in time
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 20:58:56 Nice job
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 20:28:02 But yeah, ever had a moment like that? Where some person was way too twitchy and precise to be legitimate?
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 20:26:36 Nah, you're fine I think
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 20:25:59 But seriously though back to what I was saying, I called someone out for aimbotting, and their aim was suddenly downright terrible afterwards
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 20:24:50 ......... Guys, why?
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 20:24:09 ... Really <@192861290677534722> ?
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 20:23:34 ..... Why are you always against every single fucking thing I do Empire, unless it has to do with banning someone who's done something horribly wrong?
What I mean is their aim went from pinpoint to crap all of a sudden
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 20:21:47 Don't forget, they aren't stuck on/off with it you know, I've called someone out in that game before, and as soon as I did their aim dropped like an anvil
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 20:21:17 Meh, that might just be me in a bad/over-sensitive mood though, especially after the first one I found
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 20:20:53 Because I have reason to believe that there's a bot in your server YouMad
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 20:19:58 I mean let me just bring up this again to show "I know what the fuck I'm doing"
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 20:17:46 Well either these people were downright dieties of sniping, or they're hacking, and considering they aimed at people through cover (Though thankfully they couldn't SHOOT through cover), yeaaaahhhhh, no, I don't think they're legitimate
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 20:16:08 It's, currently going through a bit of a "phase" I guess with the snipers
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 20:15:47 This game: https://www.roblox.com/games/3233893879/Bad-Business-Prototype-1-5-0#!/game-instances
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 20:15:29 Bad Business
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 20:15:21 Yeah, DON'T tell me that's not aimbotting
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 20:15:01 If you're wondering about the previous one I caught <@!249373398612967441> , it was a guy who was twitching around to all the positions of the players with a sniper, as soon as he found one that was out of cover, he snapped back and fired a single shot for a kill, then started snapping around again
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 20:12:14 Can I just mention I really despise snipers in Roblox games? They're literally just a giant sign going "Hey add aimbot to this game!"
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 02:43:58 You don't need to show me, just, why are you trying to post that?
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 02:43:36 .......... I will ban you if you're trying to start shit
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 02:43:02 <@!442848465857544193> , What the hell did you try to do exactly?
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 23:33:16 You can CTRL+F it
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 23:33:08 Generally uncomfortable with it, but otherwise I'd say don't take it too far, and no it's not true
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 23:32:06 By that point people are so close to death that one or two grazing shots kills them
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 23:31:48 If my AK runs out, and I NEED to keep on firing, I generally prefer to swap to the shotgun
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 23:31:05 I generally prefer the AK, although at a certain point, I transition over to the pistol, for what reason? I don't know, all I know is when I do so, suddenly I'm just a snapshot god for some reason
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 23:28:26 For reference, people have 150 health in BB, the AR does about 30 damage per shot, pistol does 50
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 23:27:57 Saw an AR/pistol to (it killed people in 3 shots, but otherwise had an AR performance)
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 23:27:04 Definitely not, the wall was PAINTED with red pretty much (Aka alot of bullets just hit the wall)
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 23:26:03 (The kill feed even popped up as snipers, but we saw him using the shotgun)
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 23:25:52 I'd say former, there's signs that they're the latter if they're the latter, but it's probably the former, considering I have met alot of people that are very dubious (Shotgun sniper for example)
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 23:24:45 Trust me, you'll probably bump into one or two (Example: One guy took 12 DAMN PISTOL SHOTS and still refused to go down)
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 23:23:41 That's Roblox for ya
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 23:22:58 This was through walls by the way
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 23:22:49 At one point someone actually decided to go all out exploiter in BB, and the wireframe of everyone suddenly popped up, and everyone freaked out (This was back in like 1.3.4 or something though, can't remember)
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 23:20:43 In Bad Business, it clears your kills when the round starts
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 23:19:58 Can we just agree that the knife is downright useless by the way?
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 23:19:28 I tend to park around mid and just run to the sides
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 23:19:00 Bad Business
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 23:18:29 I can not get a headshot for the love of my life aside from an accident however, that's the one main flaw I have
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 23:16:54 If they're up close, shotgun to the face, medium range, AK vs AK, long range, pistol, and if they're in cover, I either try to snapshot them with the sniper or suppress them
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 23:13:30 Meanwhile me, at the end of a round of Bad Business
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 22:53:31 Again, ping me all you want (Aside from ABSOLUTE spam), I'm fine with it
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 22:53:14 It's fine

plane-crazy 2019-06-11 02:20:06 <@!567854080568066069> VietcongAmbush, I'll "pretend" your current account and your banned account aren't related to eachother, but so help me, if you keep on trying to cause a shitstorm, I will not hesitate to seek and ban you, and every other alt that you put on here, until you absolutely quit it
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 02:18:54 Same PFP, same behavior (Or so Imperial [Who's rather decent at this] claims), and already trying to cause problems

plane-crazy 2019-06-11 02:17:23 ..... <@!567854080568066069> Viet, didn't I ban you for 2 NSFW things?
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 02:16:30 Viet, why are you still trying to cause problems here?
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 02:16:14 Right, your argument fell on it's face, because you don't even understand the basics of utilizing evidence
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 02:14:52 ...... It's pathetic if anything
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 02:14:07 Get over it VietcongAmbush
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 02:02:22 Same pfp to ...
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 02:00:34 I can literally make a better one within the hour if I actually wanted to put the effort into doing so
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 02:00:11 No
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 01:57:56 Right, QUIT BEING A SADISTIC ASSHOLE, nobody laughs at a joke like that

plane-crazy 2019-06-11 01:57:19 .... I just said fuck no
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 01:57:07 Just because you are something, doesn't give you the right to insult it
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 01:56:57 Let me just run this through with you as an example: Is it okay to make holocaust jokes if you're Jewish?
Answer: Fuck no
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 01:55:58 It ain't fucking funny
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 01:55:42 <@!567854080568066069> , Cut the jokes about autism
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 01:55:29 No
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 01:54:33 <@492398221432455168> , It's not exactly easy to make motors work when you need to make motors on motors on motors, on motors work with projects that are on average upwards of 5-6K blocks
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 01:53:40 More what to be exact?
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 01:51:41 <@!567854080568066069> , I'm going to be honest, that's so bad it's actually insulting that you thought it'd go for inventor
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 01:51:26 .................
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 01:50:31 ..... Show it to us
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 01:49:46 I seriously doubt it to the point of saying it's laughable that you even thought it'd work, but show me
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 01:49:08 Flying already done, boats are already done, trucks already done
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 01:49:01 A mechanism, not an object
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 01:40:33 Shows you how smart people on Roblox are
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 00:20:03 No
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 00:19:23 Don't ask ...
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 00:18:02 <@456226577798135808> , Change your PFP, now

plane-crazy 2019-06-09 06:31:42 Look for the biggest ones and start sniping those, or just go berserk on the list, you're probably downloading a virus or something

plane-crazy 2019-06-08 21:25:24 <@438884464060399630> Do I need to reinstate the last warn, since you didn't learn at all whatsoever?
plane-crazy 2019-06-08 21:23:44 I'm going to turn around, and pretend none of this is happening (Aside from Furious because he already was warned for it once and he didn't stop), but if I see any more in-game bypassing, I'm going to fucking hang someone (Not literally)

plane-crazy 2019-06-08 19:56:24 HEY HEY HEY, just look at it first before screaming Esio
plane-crazy 2019-06-08 19:56:12 Dunno, also, anyone remember this? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortnite:_Save_the_World
plane-crazy 2019-06-08 19:55:33 I mean, let's face it, EA's a cash grab at this point
plane-crazy 2019-06-08 19:54:42 Remember what it ORIGINALLY was?
plane-crazy 2019-06-08 19:53:08 If they try to push it on you, THEN shout for us, but let people like what they like
plane-crazy 2019-06-08 19:52:41 Fuck's sake, <@!242650210583576576> , let people like what they like
plane-crazy 2019-06-08 19:50:36 Pictures are an absolute no-go, cropped pictures count just the same if anyone recognizes them, and people will probably recognize them
plane-crazy 2019-06-08 19:48:24 Guys, it's called COMMON, FUCKING, SENSE, use some for fuck's sake, this is a Roblox server, while we're a TINY bit more lenient than Roblox it's self, we still need to make it very child friendly
plane-crazy 2019-06-08 19:47:44 I can't take a fucking health break without this shit happening ... God damn it
plane-crazy 2019-06-08 05:36:10 The chat just tends to be a bit sleepier during these times

plane-crazy 2019-06-07 23:45:10 ...... I glanced over at the modlogs, __***REALLY <@!368630214747619340> !? REALLY!?***__
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 23:44:43 And whoever else is involved in it

plane-crazy 2019-06-07 23:44:24 Guys, can you fucking leave stuff behind? If drama happens in another server, don't drag it here
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 19:49:04 <@!311996873650995200> , that fighter doesn't have enough armor to survive any amount of firepower, and with the technique of rotary spread, there's no way to evade every single shot, so it's a worthless fighter in that regard (Not to mention modern CWIS fire will rip it to pieces)
plane-crazy 2019-06-06 06:06:31 They aren't military groups, they're pyramid schemes
plane-crazy 2019-06-06 06:06:22 Meanwhile some dipshit that joined a day later gets a higher rank, just because he spent money on the game
plane-crazy 2019-06-06 06:06:02 I was in two, got highest merits in both, even when the highest ranks had benefits (Most notably one group had extremely powerful tanks for their higher ranks to use for free), and they didn't bat an eye at it
plane-crazy 2019-06-06 06:04:35 They're basically a pyramid scheme fueled by Roblox
plane-crazy 2019-06-06 06:04:20 A very scummy one at that to be honest
plane-crazy 2019-06-06 06:04:04 A war group
plane-crazy 2019-06-06 06:03:47 Is that seriously the TNI thing?
plane-crazy 2019-06-06 06:01:44 <@456226577798135808> , It definitely was really offensive to be honest
plane-crazy 2019-06-06 01:47:01 If anyone else finds it's NSFW though, you're going to be banned for a long, long while
plane-crazy 2019-06-06 01:46:33 I see it, it's fine, I think
plane-crazy 2019-06-06 01:44:01 5 minutes ...
plane-crazy 2019-06-06 01:43:48 And if it's something even worse, don't bother coming back till tomorrow
plane-crazy 2019-06-06 01:43:34 But seriously just change your PFP ...
plane-crazy 2019-06-06 01:43:12 Not exactly nicely Katze
plane-crazy 2019-06-06 01:42:08 This is a ROBLOX server
plane-crazy 2019-06-06 01:42:02 Why do you think I was kicking you over and over again?
plane-crazy 2019-06-06 01:41:43 Fucking hell <@!206045239348166656> , CHANGE YOUR PFP ALREADY
plane-crazy 2019-06-06 00:57:09 Actually nevermind
plane-crazy 2019-06-06 00:56:39 Guys ...
plane-crazy 2019-06-05 22:54:14 The hardest part is tied between monitoring the server for anything going batshit crazy, and making judgement calls without being too preferential to one person or another
plane-crazy 2019-06-05 22:53:16 What is it?
plane-crazy 2019-06-05 16:09:48 Uhhhhh, what?
plane-crazy 2019-06-05 15:24:23 Er, don't, blame me for this
plane-crazy 2019-06-05 15:23:13 That's the primary difficulty
plane-crazy 2019-06-05 15:23:04 We don't have a solid white line where one side's allowed and the other isn't
plane-crazy 2019-06-05 15:22:50 It's, complicated
plane-crazy 2019-06-05 15:21:56 Then don't share the VIP server link, at the very least let us know before inviting them so we can discuss it
plane-crazy 2019-06-05 15:19:28 We need to make sure somebody doesn't just up and ruin VIP 1, that's why we've made it so you need a rank to access it
plane-crazy 2019-06-05 15:18:56 Slow, still, confirm with one of us
plane-crazy 2019-06-05 15:16:44 Hi, bye
plane-crazy 2019-06-05 15:16:06 <@!302698900521877504> , Can you please NOT leak the VIP server link? At least verify it with us beforehand, because we don't want VIP servers to be filled with trolls
plane-crazy 2019-06-05 15:05:50 Fonkl, be sure to ask nicely, you'd be surprised at how ineffective pure force is
plane-crazy 2019-06-05 15:05:20 OKAY OKAY OKAY ENOUGH RUSSIAN IT'S HARD TO MANAGE
plane-crazy 2019-06-05 15:04:29 It's Russian, I have a friend that speaks Russian and it matches perfectly

plane-crazy 2019-06-05 15:03:15 <@!422648520378548224> , 2 things
1: We'd like to know how you got into VIP 1 without going "!servers", as that wouldn't work
2: You need to make a vehicle that applies to <#544022464133595166>

plane-crazy 2019-06-05 15:02:21 Guys, you're both blind
plane-crazy 2019-06-05 15:01:59 We won't necessarily take action on it, but if you would please, we'd like to understand how you got in
plane-crazy 2019-06-05 15:01:38 We've had to restrict access to VIP 1 after alot of people kept on trolling us in the server
plane-crazy 2019-06-05 15:01:09 You're in VIP server 1, correct?
plane-crazy 2019-06-05 15:00:35 We won't necessarily ban you from there unless you start acting like an asshole (We've had that problem many times before with randoms accessing VIP 1), but we would like to know how you got in <@!422648520378548224>
plane-crazy 2019-06-05 14:59:56 <@!422648520378548224> , If you would please explain how you got in the VIP server
plane-crazy 2019-06-05 14:59:43 Hold up all of you
plane-crazy 2019-06-05 14:59:31 What?

plane-crazy 2019-06-02 22:46:41 He petittioned, showed proof of growth (At least via DMs), and various stuff
plane-crazy 2019-06-02 22:43:29 But the ultimatum was going to be a 5 minute mute for whoever continued on, increasing by 5 minutes for each person muted, and at every interval of 30, I would've issued a warn alongside it
plane-crazy 2019-06-02 22:43:08 I don't need to issue it since you three calmed down
plane-crazy 2019-06-02 22:42:27 At the very least he won't bother us anymore

plane-crazy 2019-06-02 22:18:28 So I'd suggest verifying with a mod or something from now on, I'm always open
plane-crazy 2019-06-02 22:18:08 Right, let me just be blunt, you have absolutely 0 concept of what's NSFW and what isn't at this point in time
plane-crazy 2019-06-02 22:17:45 I'll pretend you never posted that if you delete it within the next 15 seconds
plane-crazy 2019-06-02 22:17:29 .... Excuse me <@!478024687364997131> ?
plane-crazy 2019-06-02 22:14:06 What the fuck's going on exactly?
plane-crazy 2019-06-02 20:21:31 .... <@!272125457703501826> , SERIOUSLY!?
plane-crazy 2019-06-02 18:36:30 I mean, I did try to make an interceptor lineup, I scrapped it on the first one though
plane-crazy 2019-06-02 18:35:33 And so far I've got no ideas coming to mind
plane-crazy 2019-06-02 18:35:28 I've got spectacle creep Empire, whatever I make now I feel like has to be better than the previous creations in some way, shape and/or form
plane-crazy 2019-06-02 18:35:08 Oh yeah you can even see the front axle turn
plane-crazy 2019-06-02 18:34:59 Ah
plane-crazy 2019-06-02 18:34:43 I'm guessing two of the wheels give force, the other two rotate to turn?
plane-crazy 2019-06-02 18:33:56 So, to make something like that in one day Katze, that's kinda impressive
plane-crazy 2019-06-02 18:33:51 
plane-crazy 2019-06-02 18:33:43 This thing took a design vision as well as a week's worth of constant investment to make it function the same as my Wyverns, which as I've mentioned, only Turismo has ever beaten
plane-crazy 2019-06-02 18:32:57 I mean, for making it in one day Katze, it is pretty good
plane-crazy 2019-06-02 18:32:27 If you aren't willing to put in the effort to make it perfect, you won't have the effort to make it at all
plane-crazy 2019-06-02 18:31:08 Your creation <@!531625591380770831> , is small, uninteresting, and can't fly under it's own natural volition
plane-crazy 2019-06-02 18:30:07 <@456226577798135808> , that gets you permanently banned from ever having ranks ever, and potentially a tempban from the server, due to the fact that copying is so frowned upon
plane-crazy 2019-06-02 18:29:43 Okay, that aside, it looks like a freaking Toxeed tutorial plane with a sprinkle of wedges

plane-crazy 2019-06-01 18:00:06 Right, <@461111372239994881> , what he's referring to is how euphemisms count towards the NSFW rule nowadays
plane-crazy 2019-06-01 17:59:05 Re-reading it over, fuck's sake Alvin, don't joke about that stuff
plane-crazy 2019-06-01 17:58:56 Wait .....

plane-crazy 2019-06-01 17:57:02 Yeah well so far I haven't seen him do anything of the sort, so I'd say he's refreshed at least

plane-crazy 2019-06-01 17:53:56 <@!351809528209080324> , I don't give a damn, it's called being a horrible human being

plane-crazy 2019-05-31 23:15:36 And why we went from like 30 servers to 2
plane-crazy 2019-05-31 23:15:30 Hence why we went from a "#servers" channel to just doing "!servers"
plane-crazy 2019-05-31 23:15:15 And even then it's been too chaotic trying to manage every single VIP server
plane-crazy 2019-05-31 23:15:06 It's mostly for Plane Crazy servers sadly
plane-crazy 2019-05-31 23:13:03 Well, you record his roles Imperial, my folder's actually ridiculously full of people's roles

plane-crazy 2019-05-31 23:09:03 <@!531625591380770831> , legal reasons, read Discord ToS
plane-crazy 2019-05-31 23:06:16 Alright then
plane-crazy 2019-05-31 23:05:34 If you aren't 13 years old or older, even with parental permission, you can get into legal troubles
plane-crazy 2019-05-31 23:05:19 It's due to Discord Terms of Service that it's now a legal issue for us to find out
plane-crazy 2019-05-31 23:05:02 Just, Enqrises, we need to be sure
plane-crazy 2019-05-31 23:04:56 FFS, everyone always says "im 14" when they're underage

plane-crazy 2019-05-25 20:53:53 The reason I'm picking a side here <@!351809528209080324> , is because YOU'RE throwing insults, even infront of me
plane-crazy 2019-05-25 20:51:06 <@!351809528209080324> .....
plane-crazy 2019-05-25 20:50:19 Guys, cut it out

plane-crazy 2019-05-25 01:08:54 But yeah, that guy tried mass pinging in multiple servers before immediately hightailing it as soon as a mod or admin (or anyone with power) came on
plane-crazy 2019-05-25 01:08:31 It's fine Katze
plane-crazy 2019-05-25 01:07:07 God freaking, whatever, I'll just trust that Dyno's got it logged down

plane-crazy 2019-05-25 01:06:28 Just gonna do a preemptive ban, this guy tried mass pinging like 30 times over in one of my other servers
plane-crazy 2019-05-24 22:31:27 Well I'm off again, seeya
plane-crazy 2019-05-24 22:30:43 <@!545839816667955220> , it's sorta so we can keep track of you so you don't build NSFW stuff in our servers, we've had that happen a couple of times
plane-crazy 2019-05-24 22:29:54 Oh for the love of, can you two please bicker in DMs? I don't want to deal with this
plane-crazy 2019-05-24 22:29:34 Katze, they're gone already
plane-crazy 2019-05-24 22:28:42 Yes, hi, mod here, just dealing with a troll here in my favorite way possible, hey asshole <@456226577798135808> , get lost

plane-crazy 2019-05-24 22:27:03 <@456226577798135808> , How about I just ban you instead then?
plane-crazy 2019-05-24 22:26:52 ......
plane-crazy 2019-05-24 22:26:35 I shouldn't have to do this TWICE damn it

plane-crazy 2019-05-24 22:25:12 Someone run me through a TL;DR if they'd please I'm on a bit of a time crunch here
plane-crazy 2019-05-24 22:24:55 Right, I blink on here and I see talks of banning, the fuck's going on?
plane-crazy 2019-05-24 20:19:01 Impressive control, although I'll leave it up to the others, I'm not a rocket expert, and I'm in a very bad mood today
plane-crazy 2019-05-24 20:10:02 Send it here and we'll be the judge of that Rob
plane-crazy 2019-05-24 20:09:00 Katze
plane-crazy 2019-05-24 20:08:57 It's a joke
plane-crazy 2019-05-24 20:08:34 Something tells me it's a joke Katze
plane-crazy 2019-05-24 20:08:23 Sadly no Battleship
plane-crazy 2019-05-24 20:08:01 But anyways, <@456226577798135808> , I'm mostly warning for that damn excuse to try to cover it up
plane-crazy 2019-05-24 20:07:44 Bad idea Terminator
plane-crazy 2019-05-24 20:07:16 __***NOW FUCKING STOP DIPSHIT, I'M NOT IN THE MOOD FOR THIS***__
plane-crazy 2019-05-24 20:06:33 .......
plane-crazy 2019-05-24 20:05:57 <@456226577798135808> , I believe, for your own sake, that, at most, you mean "humanity", not "__***WHITE***__ race"
plane-crazy 2019-05-24 20:05:31 ...........
plane-crazy 2019-05-24 20:05:26 <@456226577798135808> , Let people like what they like, or so help me I'll fucking burn your eyes so you never have to see another "furry" thing ever again
<@!486674992981999648> , be less aggressive for fuck's sake
plane-crazy 2019-05-24 20:04:18 I'm not in the mood for this, so calmly, and clearly, explain it to me
plane-crazy 2019-05-24 20:04:03 ...... The fuck, is going on here?
plane-crazy 2019-05-24 14:44:11 Just cut it out
plane-crazy 2019-05-24 14:43:57 Katze, why?
plane-crazy 2019-05-24 14:43:44 ......
plane-crazy 2019-05-24 13:58:17 I mean, considering the amount of original builds he makes, he's pretty good on that front
plane-crazy 2019-05-24 00:32:12 Voxel's in a joking mood so it seems
plane-crazy 2019-05-24 00:31:54 Anyways, welcome <@!370736084306493441> , feel free to wander around, just please don't cause trouble, we get enough of it as it is
plane-crazy 2019-05-24 00:30:58 Check the mod chat
plane-crazy 2019-05-24 00:30:05 ... Who are you <@!370736084306493441> ?
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 21:07:17 I mean, so far it's getting better, at the very least they're putting in effort to attempt to keep the promise
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 02:19:48 Just, take an in-game screenshot of the player list
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 02:19:14 Because THIS, doesn't seem of age
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 02:18:46 And from the first 4 things you've said, you haven't exactly made it seem like you're of proper age
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 02:18:26 <@!319971087599271936> , we do this with people we believe to be under 13 years old
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 02:17:09 Show a screenshot or something ...
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 02:16:32 Prove it, if you're over 13 you'll know how
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 02:16:01 .... <@!319971087599271936> , if you are under 13 years old, again, leave, immediately, you and/or your parents can be fined or even arrested if you remain here
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 02:14:47 "Is 9 legal", why 9?
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 02:14:20 If so, why'd you ask such a specific number?
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 02:14:10 ........ Are you really?
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 02:13:49 .... Please exit the server immediately, due to Terms of Service updates, it's illegal to be under 13 years old, even with parental permission
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 02:13:20 First of all, how old are you, I need to ask for legal reasons
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 02:13:00 <@!319971087599271936> , Can we help you exactly? ...
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 23:01:42 <@456226577798135808> , it's called Rick has a limited amount of time, so you can't have every single nice thing in the universe
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 22:25:43 Katze, calm down a bit
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 22:24:54 <@!279641544749875223> , sadly we don't have any in-game power, only Madattak and Rickje have in-game powers, post a screenshot in <#478584971670454284> of what you need help with, then we'll judge if he needs to be banned or not
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 22:23:48 Well, hmmm
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 22:21:44 ........ Right, I'm taking a heath break, one of you take over, break his face if you need to, honestly I've burned out trying to be patient
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 22:20:59 It's called a joke
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 22:19:55 Namely in this game, maybe not other games, but definitely in this game
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 22:19:42 ..... <@!279641544749875223> , learning it on your own lets the information sink in, and I'm not saying this just out of speculation, I'm saying it out of experience
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 22:18:54 The best way to learn is to learn it on your own
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 22:18:46 Kazr, that's not a good path to learning
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 22:18:07 Right, the reason we thought you were trolling <@!279641544749875223> , is because you kept on asking extraordinarily basic questions, that can be figured out simply by experimenting with the game
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 22:17:28 ..... <@!279641544749875223> , can you NOT say it in an excessively rude manner? You're literally stuffing in words just to make it even ruder than it needs to be
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 22:16:29 To be honest each of us have a different personality that generally leans towards "We're nice", but the problem is when people constantly cause trouble
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 22:15:51 .... Very well then I suppose
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 22:15:12 ..... <@!279641544749875223> , why, did you feel the need to pull that up exactly?
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 22:14:39 Well, it works out close enough anyways Robo
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 22:14:31 <@!279641544749875223> , There, just feel lucky that I was in a semi-nice mood
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 22:13:48 ?clearwarn <@!279641544749875223>
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 22:13:41 .... Dyno why?
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 22:13:26 Right, Dyno's awake again, let's get to it
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 22:13:10 I'm not saying 3/3 because that's just booting him from the server, nor 1/3 because this was both really irritating and nearly kicked up a giant shitstorm
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 22:12:49 I know you two, just,
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 22:12:23 Then first things first, accept 2/3 of the warns as a reminder of the shitstorm you've thrown in here, and get over it
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 22:11:51 Because the latter's what you've been doing as far as I've seen you on here
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 22:11:38 So, <@!279641544749875223> , are you going to act like a decent human being, or are you just going to constantly whine about things that my 6 year old cousin gets, and pretend you're the only one that needs to be listened to?
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 22:10:57 Lego, I'd suggest backing out for about 5, maybe 10 or 15 minutes
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 22:10:48 You're starting to break down to just throwing general shit around in a vague attempt at being superior to everyone else
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 22:10:19 Okay that's it, <@!279641544749875223> , shut it, now
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 22:09:27 .... <@!279641544749875223> , that's one reason why we called you a troll
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 22:08:43 Not to mention you could experiment with it yourself
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 22:08:32 <@!279641544749875223> , It's something so, blatantly simple, that even 6 year old children understood it
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 22:08:05 That's because it's a question that my 6 year old cousin knew, even without playing the game
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 22:07:26 Right, <@!279641544749875223> , we've answered your question to the best of our abilities, however, it's an extraordinarily basic question that even the average player of Roblox understands, which is quite the miracle to be honest
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 22:06:50 Give me a moment, can all of you back off for a moment?
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 22:06:39 ........
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 22:06:04 <@!279641544749875223> , we reserve every right to boot you from the server, for good, if you don't stop being a general nuisance to everyone
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 22:05:10 Right, <@!279641544749875223> , you've given nothing to the chat except a great big headache, and you've been nothing more than toxic towards everyone in multiple ways
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 22:04:27 Orange, back up a bit, let me handle this
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 21:43:05 I'm not actually sure to WHAT extent there is, but I do know there's legal consequences if you're under 13 years old on Discord
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 21:42:49 We are legally not allowed to have people under 13 years old on this server, if you are under 13  years old, you need to leave, now, or else we are legally obliged to contact authorities branch by branch to fine and/or arrest you and/or your parents
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 21:41:57 ... <@!279641544749875223> , just, right, let me be, very, very clear
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 21:41:34 Okay maybe tone it back a bit Figors
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 21:41:21 ......
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 21:41:20 Like, I can't even,
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 21:41:11 How are you so fucking stupid?
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 21:41:06 Let me be very, very, blunt, and admittedly rude
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 21:40:55 ............ How, are you so, I don't even, just,
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 21:40:28 .... Right, <@!279641544749875223> , if this is a joke, stop it, now, it's lost it's humor a long time ago
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 21:36:54 <@!279641544749875223> , nobody's going to peg him for that
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 21:36:43 ..........
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 21:36:23 Yes yes I know Esio, shush
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 21:35:10 Welp
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 21:35:08 Oh
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 21:34:45 Right, <@!279641544749875223> , that's it, I need you to show in-game proof you're over 13 years old
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 21:33:23 So far I've learned folding, turrets, swing-wings, adjustable motor speeds, monoblade helis, and tracks, as well as the ability to balance out ultra-large crafts with little to no adjustment blocks
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 21:32:28 Wrong james <@!279641544749875223>
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 21:31:45 The tutorial gives you a basic grasp on the flight mechanics of the game, everything else you need to learn on your own
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 21:31:01 ......... <@!279641544749875223> , I'm trying not to ask questions but at the same time you're making it very hard to do so
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 21:30:38 Okay okay okay let's not assume ages yet
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 21:30:26 Other side?
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 21:30:14 ... <@!279641544749875223> , just SHOW US
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 21:29:56 Just show us
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 21:29:48 Then use the purple screwdriver tool to inspect the wheels
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 21:29:31 Did you check if the wheels were properly assigned?
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 21:29:12 What do you mean by "super mad"?
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 21:28:21 No
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 21:28:11 And the thing is <@!279641544749875223> , it's not actually a good design
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 21:27:52 https://lumiere-a.akamaihd.net/v1/images/Star-Destroyer_ab6b94bb.jpeg?region=0%2C0%2C1600%2C900&width=960
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 21:27:49 <@!279641544749875223> , The closest thing you've probably made is a Star Destroyer, https://cdn11.bigcommerce.com/s-0kvv9/images/stencil/1280x1280/products/288792/406014/apiqlnwst__99662.1550860781.jpg?c=2&imbypass=on
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 21:27:10 Okay okay but seriously though let's get to maybe some actual feedback
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 21:26:48 ... <@!279641544749875223> , it's just, it's so, so hard to maintain a straight face basically when something like that happens
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 21:26:13 But anyways though, <@!279641544749875223> , you didn't design a harrier/hydra, infact, the last time we've been graced with something like that was back in mid 2018ish
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 21:24:50 .wmv files can harbor viruses
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 21:24:44 Okay okay no please convert it out of a .wmv
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 21:24:18 <@!279641544749875223> , a Hydra fighter is based off of a harrier
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 21:23:57 First of all, wrong positions, second of all, no proper wings, third, no tail, fourth, no cockpit, fifth, no front propeller
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 21:23:18 <@!279641544749875223> , no
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 21:23:13 Like, just,
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 21:23:07 I'm sorry <@!279641544749875223> , but that's not a hydra
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 21:22:48 __***THIS, IS THE HYDRA***__ https://www.gtabase.com/images/gta-5/vehicles/planes/hydra.jpg
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 21:22:40 __***THIS***__https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/gtawiki/images/c/c4/Hydra-GTAO-FrontQuarter.png/revision/latest?cb=20171009200520
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 21:22:19 Just HOW is that the Hydra!?
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 21:22:07 Right right right right right, first of all, too few wing surfaces, it's not going to work, at all
Second of all, alot of thrust at the top, not alot at the bottom
Third: Not enough control surfaces, and no vertical control surfaces
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 21:21:20 <@!279641544749875223> , HOW did you expect that to fly!? What the actual fuck!? (Forgive me, but I'm surprised to hell)
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 21:20:59 What the fu- are you, what!?
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 21:20:05 Let's see what you've got
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 21:19:17 Hello there
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 21:16:13 Welp
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 21:15:57 For fuck's sake Kayn
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 21:15:11 No you haven't done anything bad, just, we need to talk
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 21:15:04 <@!456408386330689537> , Uhhhh, could you please respond ASAP? We need a talk about the ToS
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 19:15:10 I don't want my secret to get out for dodging shots, so I'll say it via whisper
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 19:14:42 I won't say how, but I will say they are taken into consideration
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 19:14:34 The thing is, speed is taken into consideration
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 19:13:23 A battleship, dodging another battleship's broadsides, from 7K away, let that sink in for a moment
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 19:12:50 I can dodge broadsides from 7K away
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 19:12:42 I'm not sure, all I know is I know how to maneuver in order to evade shots perfectly
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 19:12:28 In the new one, it aimed for where you're going, I believe assuming zero turning
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 19:12:11 In the old Le Bote, it aimed for where you were going, assuming your turning as well as your speed
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 19:11:53 Not in the remake, the original
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 19:11:47 Also the targetting system's different between Le Botes
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 19:11:31 It was a fully decked out battleship
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 19:11:08 To be honest I've sorta lost interest in Le Bote, but if you're interested Hidear, https://www.roblox.com/games/1825841556/ALPHA-Le-bote-Rebooted
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 19:09:59 Ever fought the Atlantis? That was my personal ship, sooo
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 19:09:42 Same here Hidear
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 19:09:15 I have 3 AA on each side of the battleship, I'd go for more, but that'd leave me defenseless against subs, or I'd have to reduce my cannon firepower
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 19:08:14 I just use a fully decked out battleship with the highest DPS weapons I can get (Sometimes I regret the lack of AA though, damn carriers)
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 19:07:25 Damn, nice catch
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 19:07:13 It's called linking up your spam with someone else
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 19:06:46 But yeah, battleships are hella-inaccurate
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 19:06:39 If they hit you're as good as fucking dead, and they're good against carriers
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 19:06:29 Well
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 19:06:27 Yeah, battleships are inaccurate as hell though
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 19:06:17 I think 240 something
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 19:06:10 The remade Le-Bote
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 19:05:21 THAT, is how you give someone a slap across the face
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 19:04:17 .... <@!486947728320888842> Cut it out, now
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 19:04:10 Guys, break down the arguments and tell me what's going on
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 19:04:01 ..... Right what the fuck's going on over here?
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 19:48:04 I'm not having a good day is the thing
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 19:47:29 <@!435464209677942784> , <@!492852732609298433> WHATEVER'S GOING ON, BOTH OF YOU FIGURE IT OUT AND CUT IT OUT NOW FOR FUCK'S SAKE
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 19:47:11 Then the fuck is, I don't even,
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 19:46:52 <@!492852732609298433> , quit trying to poke into people's personal information and/or spamming
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 19:46:38 .......
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 19:46:27 Uhhhh, hmmmmmm
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 19:46:12 Wait, seriously Terminator?
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 19:45:34 <@!492852732609298433> , Can we __***HELP YOU!?***__, you're spamming the David guy constantly
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 04:22:27 It only logs chat down every minute or so though, so if you say something every frame, you're not gonna get further than the person that talks every minute
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 04:03:22 Meh, the problem with making engines too powerful is that it makes creations too easy
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 02:14:27 Nope, it's alive
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 02:14:24 ?help
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 01:37:39 I mean, so far I've managed to knock one guy off of the "pay to win" mentality
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 01:37:05 ~200ish, something like that
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 01:36:57 HAH, no, sadly I'm moreso a design dev than an actual coding dev, I can tweak the balance of a game to feel fabulous, but that's pretty much it
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 01:35:44 Yeah, apparently I'm getting in alot of dev groups recently
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 01:34:53 Look, see?
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 01:33:44 At least, I believe so
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 01:33:36 Part of the Warships dev team
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 01:33:12 This Mark to be exact by the way Empire, thought you'd be curious https://www.roblox.com/users/907754/profile/
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 01:32:27 I'm actually cooperating with Mark on another game
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 01:30:46 It's definitely against the rules
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 01:30:38 Also, I always loved to just sail around in this giant "Fuck off and die" battleship that practically nobody can hit
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 01:30:21 Exactly, that means that he's gone from the server
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 01:29:55 Hey, Le Bote was a fantastic game
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 01:29:44 You can't see his roles, can you <@318892614378061824> ?
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 01:28:29 Then he shouldn't act like he's 6, hell, he acted like he was fucking 3
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 01:27:29 I really hate dumbasses like that kid, seriously, I know they've got fucking common sense developed at that point because I've seen some of my really young cousins act better than he does
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 01:25:53 But it should get him to shut the fuck up and snap out of it
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 01:25:47 The last part's a bluff, I'm not ACTUALLY going to call them, that'd be just mean
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 01:24:58 ......
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 01:24:35 Look, it's not in our power to adjust it, even if we wanted to, so I'd suggest you just leave
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 01:24:13 So I'd suggest you leave now, before I contact authorities to branch over and give you, or your parents a large fine, aka: They need to pay money, for having broken the law
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 01:23:36 <@!383653454502952960> , you're technically knowingly violating the law by staying on here, as Discord Terms of Service have made it so you can't stay on unless you've over 13 years old
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 01:23:15 Let me explain
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 01:22:51 <@!383653454502952960>
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 01:22:20 ....
1: How old are you?
2: What don't you get?
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 01:21:27 You don't "delete" stuff per-se, you save an empty slot, Rick's adding a delete button for people who don't get it though
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 00:31:34 <@!364352162563883008> , pretend Rick's got a limited supply of money, every day he gets it all back, but he doesn't have an infinite amount, then you'll realize just why he doesn't hurl out all the parts constantly
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 00:24:15 All I can say is good luck, what's effective on paper might not be effective in practice
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 00:21:29 Good luck <@!250393834817585162>
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 00:19:54 Also some people have very busy lives
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 00:19:43 It's not the spoiler that bugged me
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 00:18:28 What are you talking about!? (Yes I did erase it, thanks for pointing that out)
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 00:18:14 Ah
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 00:18:05 Exceeeept, what warns?
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 00:17:59 ?warnings <@318892614378061824>
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 00:17:50 .... Go back and read <#533294912586645521> before you make another damn quip
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 00:17:14 ?Warnings <@!396508970761715712>
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 00:17:09 It's called fucking rules
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 00:16:30 I don't give a fuck
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 00:16:14 Erase that, __***NOW***__
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 00:15:58 ..... <@!396508970761715712>
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 23:52:45 Okay that is just mesmerizing
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 23:39:25 It's decent, but boxy to be honest, nice touch with the people though
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 23:38:54 I might've thought of an idea
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 23:38:50 Actually, hmmmm
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 23:38:38 <@!323110865140449282> , mechanism, not just novelty
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 23:32:14 Just google "Hexadecimal color converter"
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 23:29:36 Just do what you need to do to delete it, you'll get the save data back
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 23:29:10 Save an empty plot over them, that's your way of "deleting"
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 23:28:54 You can't delete slots <@!511279873877213188> , you CAN save empty plots over them though
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 23:28:34 Huh, nice amount of detail in the engine <@477314165850243075>
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 23:26:01 I'd say finish it probably
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 23:25:41 There's a variety of ways, namely their behavior, their web link, page link, in-game as well as other ways
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 23:24:54 I'm pretty much the only guy that's fine with pinging at almost, if not all hours
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 23:24:43 It's fine
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 23:24:33 I already confirmed you're over 13, that's just using the inspect element to change the text
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 23:22:41 Yeup
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 23:22:38 Just take screenshots and show us
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 23:22:21 Anyways, Gavin, show us what you've made
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 23:21:56 We legally can not allow people we know that are under 13 years old on our server without getting varrying consequences
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 23:21:30 I mean, it's true, soooo
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 23:20:53 <@456226577798135808> , If you do not comply, you or your parents may be fined, and even outright arrested, even with parental permission, so please, leave immediately if you are under 13 years old
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 23:20:20 <@477314165850243075> , <#544022464133595166>
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 23:20:15 <@456226577798135808> , If you've got a moment, we have reason to believe you're under 13, if this is true, please immediately leave Discord, as we have to enforce their terms of service, which cause legal issues
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 20:20:22 HOW!?
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 20:19:41 Soooo, yeaaahhhh
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 20:19:26 
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 20:19:21 
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 20:19:15 This is what I see
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 20:18:55 You're really proud of that aren't you Rick?
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 20:16:45 I'm just gonna, back outa this
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 20:16:30 Uhhhhh
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 20:08:57 I mean he said it to point out that someone else has it I guess
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 20:08:38 I don't know
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 20:08:36 I guess it's a joke?
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 20:08:06 <@!260544767446745088> , The problem is people can see your tag, relatively easily, sooo
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 20:03:12 Wait, how? I don't even see those tabs
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 20:02:38 Sadly I don't think so Rick
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 20:01:31 Okay no that's a horrible idea <@456226577798135808>
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 20:00:38 The last time Madattak talked was 4 months ago, and he only has 3 pages of chat in here, the last page only being 2 things
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 19:58:18 That's probably because we're getting a bunch of new players joining who are genuinely interested
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 19:57:31 .... Uhhh, <@193734403136946176> , <#495286269459300364> please, that has little to no context in this environment currently
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 19:56:40 If you get it, fabulous, you're going to have an amazing time, if you don't, it's probably not for you anyways
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 19:56:20 The problem is Morgaxn, you either get it, or you don't, there's practically no exceptions
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 19:53:17 <@!579804769401700363> , Yes, true, but we can't catch them all, so we do need to cut corners every so often, plus it's also good for the community that we ignore SOME, not all
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 19:52:17 We mostly ignore people if they act mature, but if they act immature, then we ask questions
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 04:41:17 It's more like it simply goes to sleep
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 04:00:17 They'd better be day-long breaks
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 03:59:59 <@!184819059404046336> .......
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 03:58:36 We keep on trying to fix it, and Roblox keeps on updating physics, now be patient
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 03:57:02 <@456226577798135808> , What's broken about them exactly?
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 03:56:29 I am going to turn around, and pretend nothing happened, and I don't want to hear this happen again, I expect all of that to be erased when I'm done
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 03:56:08 Quit reposting that
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 03:56:06 ....... You know I could basically ban both of you, right?
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 02:45:13 Okay that is a pretty nice F-14 to be honest
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 02:44:56 FFS, pay attention to the "almost" part?
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 01:51:12 "Almost none", doesn't mean it's impossible
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 01:14:33 Many of us have tried, almost none have succeeded
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 01:14:10 You do realize <@!324707302470844416> , that visually appealing creations don't really fit in PVP?
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 01:11:59 Nothing so far, if guns are a problem, outmaneuver them
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 01:11:21 They count AGAINST you
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 01:09:57 And don't self-upvote
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 01:09:38 ..... Seriously?
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 00:44:33 Seeya, good luck with those Lego
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 00:44:21 IT JUST DROPPED RIGHT THERE
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 00:44:20 Soooo, all in all, fuck Comcast
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 00:43:38 I've had my connection drop like 30 times today, I'm not even exaggerating that, admittedly they were brief periods, but they were enough to disconnect me from whatever I was doing
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 00:40:56 Yeah, Comcast has been murdering it's self today
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 00:40:54 
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 00:40:25 I think it's sorta slang for like a juvenile prisoner
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 00:39:52 Alright
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 00:39:43 <@!421848903361757184> , is it closed?
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 23:27:40 G'night Rick
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 23:22:33 Hello there
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 21:42:52 I have no idea then
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 21:42:27 Internal mag detonation or something? Did you have explosives?
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 21:42:19 That's, odd, he doesn't have Btools or anything, so, the hell?
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 21:42:02 Wait, how though?
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 21:41:21 Right what the fuck's going on, one of you at a time, tell me, calmly, what happened on your end
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 21:41:06 <@!486674992981999648> , <@456226577798135808> , BOTH OF YOU, SHUT IT
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 21:40:50 ......
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 21:24:07 Needed motors, RIP
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 21:22:54 Good thing I didn't convert huh?
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 21:22:23 ?
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 20:41:39 Problem with that theory Grab is that it's not severe enough, bot attacks would be WAY more severe
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 20:40:46 It's called "People are stupid"
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 18:35:06 ....... <@!527302996288077824> , I'm getting very tired of your antics, now cut it out, or so help me I will personally erase "bob" from the entirity of the internet
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 18:29:10 Ehhhh, sorsry <@!323110865140449282> , I'm not sure it's unique enough
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 18:28:51 It is infact made to be spam, he's just trying to point it out so I won't hang him for THAT one, but still
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 18:28:36 .......
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 18:27:21 ..... <@!527302996288077824> , I've dealt with multiple types of spam and I can safely say that that meaningless post is infact spam
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 18:24:36 I kid you not it is infact meant to be spam ...
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 18:24:26 And before you argue "it isn't spam" <@!527302996288077824> , that thing, is made, TO BE SPAM
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 18:23:51 <@!527302996288077824> I, said, cut it, the fuck, out, nobody wants spam in their DMs unless it's a joke from a close friend
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 18:23:22 ?unmute <@!527302996288077824>
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 18:23:06 .....
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 18:22:51 Those things ARE genuinely spam by the way
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 18:22:42 <@!527302996288077824> NOW CUT IT OUT
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 18:21:55 .....
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 18:21:39 ... <@!527302996288077824> Cut it out
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 18:06:21 Dunno, if we knew what wasn't invented, we would've invented it already
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 18:05:59 To be honest I don't show people my creation, and it has internal mechanisms as well, so I doubt they'd copy it
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 18:05:09 Also admittedly the criteria WAS alot looser back then, but still
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 18:04:50 That's because things weren't invented yet Grab
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 18:03:42 Discord's breaking up, RIP
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 18:03:37 I think I invented a proper vehicle flipper, one which managed to flip stuff many times it's size without using engines or anything
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 18:03:35 I don't know, this was a VERY early one
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 17:57:56 I think I capitalized on one of the easy ones at the time, since I got in early
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 17:56:40 Welp, <@206891768233328640> , __***OFFICIALLY***__ beat my fighter in maneuverability
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 17:51:47 No, there's like 90 BILLION gyroscopes out there now
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 17:50:11 Also please don't upvote your own creations, people really frown upon that
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 17:50:04 <@410164867165716507> , use motors to open and close the doors, disconnectors to disconnect bombs
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 17:49:48 Ah FFS, hold on
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 17:45:15 Click and hold to fire
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 17:45:12 <@!430613089893744654> , guns work in PVP only, but you aim the motor joint part to where you want to shoot
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 17:39:46 I won't be building though, just flying around mostly
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 17:39:35 Also show a diagram Iil?
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 17:39:25 Meh, sod it, I'll join, got nothing else to do
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 17:38:22 If people run from you, hop on the alt and track them, they won't react to the alt until it's too late
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 17:38:11 Rick, make an alternate account, get Madattak to verify it's you, and use that alt to hide, tell NOBODY but Madattak about it
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 17:36:29 <@353348764280422402> , There, should be changed now, unless that's the username of your account as well
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 17:35:37 Also, <@410164867165716507> , you got master engineer, now you can access the VIP servers (Do "!servers" in <#384027830192832513> ), and you can suggest things ("&suggest (Suggestion here)", again, in <#384027830192832513> ), we mostly wait till people are ranked before we give them access to that, so 
1: They don't just steal the VIP link and run
2: We know they actually invest in the game
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 17:34:31 Er, <@353348764280422402> , hold on while I update ya
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 17:34:02 Damn, blocks instead of beams?
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 17:33:46 Hey <@410164867165716507> , how large is your bomber in terms of parts?
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 17:33:30 The drone's from one of the main missions
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 17:32:41 I doubt it, people have made bikes before
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 17:32:32 Oh, OOOHHH, inventor
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 17:32:26 This thing
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 17:31:49 You might be airlifted soon Turismo
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 17:31:21 Maybe Turismo's?
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 17:31:10 And lift up one of the sizable cars
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 17:30:59 How about make that mega drone from Watchdogs 2, or the spider tank
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 17:30:20 That's called a critical hit <@!505835349889777685> , anything can win against anything if you properly ammo rack them
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 17:28:55 Reloading any kinetic weapon is HAAARRRRD, especially if the vehicle has other functionalities
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 17:28:16 Load em all with nukes
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 17:28:04 How many missile/torpedo tubes do you have?
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 17:27:30 I mean, go for it
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 17:27:20 Please don't use .wmv files, we've had multiple virus attacks from those things, and we'd rather not be held responsible or be a victim of one
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 17:26:41 To get ranks from <#544022464133595166> , post a creation in <#504436696021204992> , a bot will automatically port it over to <#384025409945337856>
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 17:26:19 Infact, if you want, you can try posting in the competition, check <#504718138399522832> for what's currently going on
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 17:25:55 You're allowed to post pretty much anything as long as it follows the rules
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 17:25:40 Also, yes you are <@!508788110906097719> , as long as it follows the rules
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 17:25:32 Yeup, feel free to observe the ~~occasional bouts of madness~~ tons of creativity here
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 17:25:03 Hello there
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 17:23:09 That's insane, seriously
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 17:22:23 
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 17:21:40 WHAT!?
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 17:21:20 God damn it you two (Not in a bad way though)
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 17:20:58 Scroll up and copy someone else, except with your own request
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 17:20:31 I was saying what basically happened with this https://gyazo.com/6ef6832a20adfce16185440a69443d55
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 17:20:19 <#384027830192832513>
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 17:19:59 Whaaat? It fits
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 17:19:40 "-dink- .... __***AAAAAAHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!***__"
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 17:18:52 I could get on that to be honest
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 17:18:42 So, basically Jail, just a 3X3, but with the shape of a 2X2?
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 17:18:14 Closest way to do that <@!243731791192522752> is probably use the guns stacked in a giant line
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 17:16:44 Well, at the very least people are interested in the game, right?
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 17:16:08 Also I have no idea Rick, maybe we're getting a positive bot wave?
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 17:15:52 <@!475420992798195712> , try spamming excessive again and see what happens, I can kill your damn chat in a heartbeat
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 17:14:59 That's actually pretty cool <@!243731791192522752> , what about a hat? Or maybe eye guns?
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 17:14:12 Now cut it out benis, I don't want to hear some bullshit excuse from you
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 17:14:01 And unlike you, I have connections, that make people dissapear, either off the face of the internet, or the face of the world
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 17:13:22 And I'll have you know, I have an XM556, fully loaded, ready to shred whatever the fuck you do
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 17:12:53 .... <@!475420992798195712>
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 06:12:34 If so, I have seen fucking bigger, much, MUCH bigger, both in overall volume and ESPECIALLY height, maybe not in length or width tho- .... Uhhhhhhh
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 06:11:29 <@456226577798135808> , Are you talking about this thing, which isn't even oriented properly? https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/504436696021204992/579548712821587979/unknown.png
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 23:44:18 I'm going to assume that this isn't going to get out of control
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 21:33:57 Nice cockpit design Katze
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 21:32:52 "The game only simulates wing physics with the wing panels, and unless you have an upwards thrust, you won't generate lift, which means you won't go up"
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 21:31:24 The second one's likely easier to do and balance, but the first one's definitely more interesting, IF you can make it work
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 21:30:19 You lucky little crudder, share it! (Okay nah, most of us have probably retired DQ)
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 21:29:04 Fucking hell I'm lagging behind Dungeon Quest
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 21:28:31 He's a human being to ya know (A rickbot would be epic though)
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 21:28:02 Probably had something to do
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 21:27:08 Rick's probably rolling out simpler things to fill the base content first before doing niche and novel things
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 21:26:43 Kayn, whitelisting's likely ABSURDLY hard to perfect
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 21:25:50 Also I'm fine Sam, now could you leave me be?
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 21:25:42 <@!249373398612967441> , That's gonna be complex, but it's probably doable
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 21:23:06 Cool, I've never actually watched the Simpsons, but cool, I'm guessing you like him, judging from how he's also your PFP picture
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 21:21:34 Gold, you can change your username colors ya know
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 21:19:48 Hidear, box him in
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 21:19:44 Alright, nice to see this chat winding down to, at least a friendlier portion again
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 21:18:31 That has no context in the chat currently, sooo
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 21:18:24 ... Sam, <#495286269459300364> for random memes if you don't mind
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 21:18:16 By all technicalities, it's still following the rules, sooo
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 21:17:34 So it's harder to keep track of them
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 21:17:26 Problem with muting people is that they 99% of the time go to DMs
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 21:17:16 So you just want to vent then?
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 21:16:51 And make more people disagree with it, sure
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 21:16:25 Just drop it <@!243731791192522752> , you've already pushed your point across as much as you possibly could
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 21:15:09 ... <@!243731791192522752> , Of the 26 I've met, including the ones in this server, only 5 fit that description, and even then those have at least 1 valid reason for doing so
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 21:14:13 <@!311996873650995200> , I'd imagine it's harder than it looks, but that'd be nice for sure
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 21:13:52 We're all already past that, we get your point, we understand where you're coming from, and most of us disagree with it, specifically in the manner that you're trying to enforce it
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 21:13:14 If it's about the previous topic, then please, leave it be
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 21:12:19 If you can't find a solid answer to that, then maybe you shouldn't do so?
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 21:11:02 Just, why do you want to trash talk exactly?
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 21:08:22 Not me
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 21:08:09 How'd you even wedge that in there?
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 21:06:41 We bother so much about random people because at a certain point those "random" people aren't so random anymore
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 21:06:24 Katze, I already dealt with the problem, no more hostility please
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 21:05:03 Then be better than them
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 21:04:28 <@!243731791192522752> , I get where you're coming from, yes I have seen the absolute ass end of toxicity, but 
1: That doesn't mean every single one's toxic
2: You don't have to force it
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 21:03:40 FFS, cut it out guys, I've seen both sides here
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 21:02:33 I'd rather not have to babysit a massive argument and waste my life away
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 21:02:20 Right right right right right, __***GUYS***__, can we just drop it for now?
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 21:01:15 Kayn, while it was a joke, it was definitely a joke taken way too far
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 21:00:56 You're being more toxic than all of the toxicity that I've seen within the last 48 hours in the chat combined, and that's fucking something
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 21:00:22 Right, all of you, can we just drop it,
<@!243731791192522752> , don't be a hypocryte, if you want to push your point across, then do so in a positive manner, or with hard, hard evidence and statistics
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 20:59:07 <@!243731791192522752> , 
1: Empire's right, that's stereotyping on the grounds of "Blacks vs whites"
2: If you were around for any length of time, you'd know that Katze does that mostly to get her point accross
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 20:58:22 .........
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 20:58:20 I'll be the final judge, jury and verdict on these things, so if something comes up, I'll use everything in my power to get the most satisfactory result
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 20:57:21 ......... <@!243731791192522752> , if it's a fact, then use me to enforce it
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 20:56:39 ... It gives every right to threaten so long as they have no power to actually follow through the threat
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 20:56:14 Because Jwar said something not only highly inappropriate, but very aggressive towards someone related to Katze
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 20:55:54 And I don't give a fuck, <@!243731791192522752> , if someone starts causing problems, PING ME, that's what I'm here for
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 20:55:27 GOT IT!?
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 20:55:24 <@!243731791192522752> , Once you have proof that they start becomming invasive, I'll deal with them, until then, drop it
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 20:55:08 ......
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 20:54:25 And I'm saying let people like what they like so long as it doesn't fucking affect you kakka, once they START bringing drama in, I'll deal with it, but until then pretend they don't exist
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 20:53:36 Again, let people like what they like, so long as they don't affect you
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 20:53:19 .................... You do realize that they aren't causing any problems now, right?
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 20:52:39 <@!243731791192522752> , if you're concerned that it's a cesspool, then why are you dumping the waste in it?
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 20:51:07 Excuse me for a moment
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 20:51:03 Oh my fucking,
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 20:50:46 ..........................
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 20:50:29 ..... <@!243731791192522752> I SAID LET PEOPLE LIKE WHATEVER THEY LIKE, seriously
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 20:49:54 Use a magnet engine on the top and see just how far that thing flies
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 20:49:31 Let me be brutally honest here, you don't like/dislike a person, just because of what they like, unless they push it on you, got it? Let whoever the fuck like whatever the fuck, and you'll wind up being liked back
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 20:48:35 ....... Drop it
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 20:48:27 They really aren't to be honest
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 20:47:09 ....... JUST DROP IT
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 20:46:36 Kaaatze, calm down a bit, I'm already dealing with it
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 20:46:18 It's selectively funny, fine, but I still won't allow it
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 20:45:47 The rules still apply in-game
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 20:45:41 But seriously though, don't try that again Jwar
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 20:45:22 ....... FFS you ruined that word god damn it
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 20:45:05 .... We all know what damn context you had it in, and those that don't know we're trying to shield
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 20:44:48 I __***COULD***__ count it as 2, but I'll be nice and count it as one, hoping that you don't fuck up again
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 20:44:06 Right, now then
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 20:43:55 <@285640703550423041> __***AHEM***__
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 20:43:49 .............................
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 20:41:29 There's a variety of problems with 2X2 cylinders, namely centering problems
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 20:39:45 Katze, I think he gets it, he's just trying to be nice about it
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 20:38:45 We've had straight up security breaches where one person shared with another, then shared with multiple, and suddenly all the people we've banned from the server for various reasons come back, flooding the VIP servers
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 20:38:20 Again, don't share it at all, not even with one person
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 20:37:53 So, __***DO NOT***__ share links, there are extraordinarily few, if any exceptions to this rule
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 20:37:23 Now then <@!335617147067957250> , to explain why: We've had multiple trolls appear in our VIP servers, of varrying degrees of malicious, ranging from simply showing off people, to straight up building NSFW creations in order to harass members
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 20:36:43 I removed it temporarily
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 20:36:40 If I catch you sharing links again, I will permanently remove your access to any and all VIP servers
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 20:36:21 You're not allowed to share VIP server links due to security reasons, not to mention it's literally listed in <#533294912586645521>
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 20:35:49 Your friend's fine, as long as he doesn't spread the link, but YOU <@!335617147067957250> HAVE TO ANSWER TO THIS
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 20:35:34 <@!335617147067957250> YOU have more to answer to
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 20:35:24 <@!335617147067957250> __***GET THE FUCK OVER HERE, NOW***__
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 20:35:12 Anyways, <@!335617147067957250>
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 20:35:09 Just tell him to not spread it any further, security reasons
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 20:34:47 ..... <@!335617147067957250>
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 19:31:50 Yeup, it was a scam
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 19:31:45 
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 19:31:25 Yeah that's definitely a scam
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 19:30:32 That seems dubious, can anyone else confirm if that's a legitimate site?
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 19:30:24 <@!540343176314093569> , Uhhhhh
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 18:22:09 Yeaaahhhh, multiple people are having problems, they're gonna use <#497142796961054721> as a temporary general
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 18:19:32 It's for 6 HOURS on some of the guys
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 18:19:25 Didn't work
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 18:18:26 Apologies for the minor inconvenience for a moment, I set it as low as possible
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 18:18:10 Excuse the slowmode, some of our members need their timers reset due to a bug (Multiple infact), hopefully this'll trick their timers to resetting properly
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 18:06:20 Freaking, I have 3 pages of this stuff with a high resolution
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 18:06:10 Okay, enough Hs people, let's move on
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 17:59:16 ..... Terminator, it's an "autocorrect mistake" that broke a rule, I'm going to PRETEND it was a mistake for your sake, but if I see you make another mistake like that I'm going to murder you ...
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 17:57:49 Terminator, no more excuses, if I see that again I'm going to maul you, got it?
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 17:57:38 FFS ...
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 17:56:47 Plus why does your phone even autocorrect to that stuff?
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 17:56:39 Terminator, not excuses, I want to hear you fix things
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 17:56:13 I don't want to hear excuses, I want to hear actions and results
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 17:55:56 If I see that again you're fucked beyond belief, got it?
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 17:55:44 .... <@!435464209677942784> __***HEY***__
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 17:53:46 Nope, neither saying yes or no to that
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 17:53:14 It's neither a yes nor a no and I'll keep it that way
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 17:52:53 I'm, not going to answer that ...
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 17:52:46 First of all, there's multiple structural weaknesses, second, it's a one-off creation
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 17:52:30 Surprise surprise: It's actually really weak
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 17:49:06 You'll get alot smarter and be more self-dependent if you can figure it out from there
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 17:48:51 For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction, that's all I'm going to say
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 17:48:02 Multiple people have done so <@!488791699339083821>
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 17:44:51 Thanks Linh, that's good enough
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 17:44:37 Yeah just forget about that
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 17:44:32 Oh, they're already gone from the server
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 17:44:25 ......
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 17:44:03 TMI, I'll give ya 30 seconds to erase all of that
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 17:43:34 ... Uhhhh <@!355123674954858496>
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 04:52:26 Certain wings work while wet, but not butterfly wings
plane-crazy 2019-05-17 23:18:15 Damn Turismo, nice cockpit design
plane-crazy 2019-05-17 21:55:25 You could, but there'd be very little, if any control offered at all
plane-crazy 2019-05-17 20:20:28 Oh ouch, you gonna be alright Battleship?
plane-crazy 2019-05-17 20:19:59 Told ya
plane-crazy 2019-05-17 20:19:40 He might know Superidra, sooo
plane-crazy 2019-05-17 20:19:31 Any suggestions for what paste to use for an HP Envy?
plane-crazy 2019-05-17 20:15:41 Ah
plane-crazy 2019-05-17 20:15:35 Google it Katze
plane-crazy 2019-05-17 20:15:06 What happens if you add too much thermal paste?
plane-crazy 2019-05-17 19:50:21 He's on mobile now, I'm not sure he can
plane-crazy 2019-05-17 19:49:13 Yeah that tends to happen alot, fair though
plane-crazy 2019-05-17 19:48:39 Yeah, that's fine though
plane-crazy 2019-05-17 19:48:21 __***SHIT***__, forgot that part about Dyno, but basically he tried to frame NooBaris for pinging and harassing him, badly
plane-crazy 2019-05-17 19:47:33 Use this: "Excessive toxicity and repeatedly trolling the server, while harassing multiple members, as well as attempting to falsely frame someone for something they did not do"
plane-crazy 2019-05-17 19:46:42 Riiiight, I'm making an executive decision
plane-crazy 2019-05-17 19:46:27 ......
plane-crazy 2019-05-17 19:37:03 I remember, didn't log it down since I wasn't the one that banned you I think
plane-crazy 2019-05-17 19:34:24 ... <@456226577798135808> , What are you even trying to do?
plane-crazy 2019-05-17 19:29:07 The universe hasn't even existed for that period of time
plane-crazy 2019-05-16 20:04:36 While yes you were banned before, you're past the unban period anyways, now don't act up again
plane-crazy 2019-05-16 20:04:16 Sorry <@461111372239994881> , it was someone else with an incredibly similar name
plane-crazy 2019-05-16 20:03:51 <@206891768233328640> , EVERY one of your ranks as per that list are back
plane-crazy 2019-05-16 20:02:43 Oh, got it
plane-crazy 2019-05-16 20:02:33 I don't have Turismo's ranks, sorry
plane-crazy 2019-05-16 20:02:19 Post that
plane-crazy 2019-05-16 20:02:17 
plane-crazy 2019-05-16 20:01:57 Not that
plane-crazy 2019-05-16 20:01:33 Fucking, hold on a moment, the bot's acting up
plane-crazy 2019-05-16 20:01:14 ..... Wait
plane-crazy 2019-05-16 20:00:57 Then show evidence that you are, because in the mod logs we have you banned for being under 13 years old
plane-crazy 2019-05-16 20:00:32 <@461111372239994881> , you're underage, I have to ask you to leave, now, as per the Discord ToS, and by an (admittedly limited) extent the law, to leave until you're over 13 years old WITH parental permission
plane-crazy 2019-05-16 03:46:10 Back
plane-crazy 2019-05-16 03:31:44 I'm busy fixing my hard drive
plane-crazy 2019-05-16 03:31:38 Wat?
plane-crazy 2019-05-16 03:29:49 Uhhhhhhh
plane-crazy 2019-05-16 03:23:49 Fuck, ing, __***HELL!!!!***__
Also hi Battleship
plane-crazy 2019-05-16 03:23:21 Well, that freaking crash broke the link, and since Dyno didn't record it, I can't send it to Discord (I tried a similar case before, they need hard evidence)
plane-crazy 2019-05-16 03:22:12 My fucking computer ... I'm gonna check the hard drive on this damn thing
plane-crazy 2019-05-16 03:15:48 Excuse me while I hunt him down and murder him

plane-crazy 2019-05-16 02:23:03 Just think, how would you like it if someone did it to you
plane-crazy 2019-05-16 02:22:17 <@456226577798135808> , I'm just gonna say this once, can you please, for courtesy's sake, NOT post excessively long songs? It's not a specific rule, it's just not courteous
plane-crazy 2019-05-16 02:07:12 It's the "bditch" part that's irritating me
plane-crazy 2019-05-16 02:06:55 <@438884464060399630> ........
plane-crazy 2019-05-16 02:06:47 .....
plane-crazy 2019-05-16 02:05:10 One more inappropriate thing and so help me, even if it's not strictly NSFW
plane-crazy 2019-05-16 02:04:46 Cut it out ...
plane-crazy 2019-05-16 02:04:39 <@456226577798135808> , HEY!
plane-crazy 2019-05-16 02:02:30 Every time I come on, even after I tell you to leave me alone, it's freaky at this point
plane-crazy 2019-05-16 02:02:13 Colonel, leave me alone, your obsession with me's freaking me the hell out
plane-crazy 2019-05-16 02:02:02 ... I'm getting deja-vu with this
plane-crazy 2019-05-16 02:01:49 Anti, what did they say?
plane-crazy 2019-05-16 02:00:59 Sam, shut it, I barely visit the VC and even I know you've done so ...
plane-crazy 2019-05-16 01:59:58 ...... That, is pretty much the most petty way of doing something like that, asking them how to do something
plane-crazy 2019-05-16 01:59:20 Let me take a guess, you blocked Katze?
plane-crazy 2019-05-16 01:55:53 .... <@456226577798135808> , Cut it out, Katze's got a point, just Google it, it's faster than this
plane-crazy 2019-05-16 01:54:03 Blob, why do you want to know exactly?

plane-crazy 2019-05-16 01:46:38 Hey, Dyno's been on the fritz recently, what do you want us to do? Wait till we need it and THEN see if it works?
plane-crazy 2019-05-16 01:45:52 Thanks Katze
plane-crazy 2019-05-16 01:45:50 Well it works
plane-crazy 2019-05-16 01:45:01 We're having troubles with Dyno, if it fails to auto-unmute, I'll manually do it
plane-crazy 2019-05-16 01:44:33 Katze, mind if I test a 1 minute Dyno mute on you, to see if it works?
plane-crazy 2019-05-16 01:43:07 Basically it's a metroid evolution line of all of the metroids found in all of the current games

plane-crazy 2019-05-15 18:20:50 It's called bot attacks Rick, people do bot warfare all the time on the front page
plane-crazy 2019-05-15 16:38:34 RIP by Rick
plane-crazy 2019-05-15 16:27:22 I mean, it's related to Plane Crazy, and you are a relatively long lasting member, sooo
plane-crazy 2019-05-15 16:27:03 Uhhhh, I'd say go for it honestly, please remove the link once you're finished though
plane-crazy 2019-05-15 15:48:22 His contest creation, the jet
plane-crazy 2019-05-15 15:48:03 Yeah he didn't self-upvote
plane-crazy 2019-05-15 15:47:26 I didn't scroll up just to upvote i- wait
plane-crazy 2019-05-15 15:47:04 Just checked for self-upvotes, nada

plane-crazy 2019-05-15 15:42:58 Let's boot the popular "games" off the front page
plane-crazy 2019-05-15 15:42:46 The bloody hell? The front page is drunk! GIVE IT MORE ALCOHOL!
plane-crazy 2019-05-15 15:40:18 <@!202959294705041408> , can you quit DMing me? It was voted no by like the whole group, it's nice yes, but apparently it was done before
plane-crazy 2019-05-15 07:31:25 Huh, well then, consolidate a message about the explosion in the non-PVP server in <#478584971670454284> , and be sure to note that it wasn't a PVP server
plane-crazy 2019-05-15 07:30:27 If you see a little yellow, then red trail, that's the guns firing, which means you're in a PVP server, which means someone likely sniped you with a rocket
plane-crazy 2019-05-15 07:30:06 Really hard to do so and not really needed up until this point, you SURE it exploded in a non-PVP server? Check if guns can fire if you're still in it
plane-crazy 2019-05-15 07:29:09 You must've been hit by a missile, explosive block, detonated an explosive block, or there's a hacker on your server, if it's not a PVP server, it's the last part
plane-crazy 2019-05-15 07:27:36 There's PVP servers where stuff can explode you (Explosive blocks, missiles, etc), and non-PVP servers, by "explode", do you mean actually explode, or just parts flew everywhere randomly?
plane-crazy 2019-05-15 07:26:03 Are you in a PVP server? If not, what are you using?
plane-crazy 2019-05-15 07:22:44 <@!233845993907552256> , Yes, a billion people have reported the tutorial's broken, the problem is that without the tutorial, people would have no idea what to do, so it's better than nothing at the very least
plane-crazy 2019-05-15 04:29:34 It's fine, I put it up to the board because I need to go for now
plane-crazy 2019-05-15 04:28:46 I've put it up to the board, well then
plane-crazy 2019-05-15 04:27:45 Then
plane-crazy 2019-05-15 04:27:44 Well
plane-crazy 2019-05-15 04:27:42 THE F-
plane-crazy 2019-05-15 04:26:01 Er, pfff, up to you Turismo
plane-crazy 2019-05-15 04:25:56 Ever heard of using Google and just googling your problem?
plane-crazy 2019-05-15 04:25:26 Just to anything that'll run naturally
plane-crazy 2019-05-15 04:25:05 .wmv files can harbor viruses, I had to deal with a couple
plane-crazy 2019-05-15 04:24:58 Not .wmvs, use a converter or something
plane-crazy 2019-05-15 04:20:26 Huh, never knew that Turismo
plane-crazy 2019-05-15 04:19:27 I mean, true Turismo, although I'm pretty sure they still open up to let something out
plane-crazy 2019-05-15 04:18:48 There's very few guns that eject without opening the slide, and those are moreso muskets than guns
plane-crazy 2019-05-15 04:17:36 "WHETHER __***BY MAG***__ OR __***BY HAND***__"
plane-crazy 2019-05-15 04:16:58 The inventor task I've assigned him is to make a rifle, that fires a bullet, ejects the casing, and can load another round, whether by mag or by "hand"
plane-crazy 2019-05-15 04:16:25 Except I've already seen that happen
plane-crazy 2019-05-15 04:15:22 He's trying for inventor Empire ...
plane-crazy 2019-05-15 04:15:00 The actual bullet inside of the casing, with a "primer" in the back (That can be the magnet) with some powder inside
plane-crazy 2019-05-15 04:14:27 I expect SOMETHING LIKE THIS http://www.thefirearms.guide/wp-content/uploads/diag_bullet-cutout.jpg
plane-crazy 2019-05-15 04:13:45 .... Seriously Empire?
plane-crazy 2019-05-15 04:13:18 Not to mention you don't have the casing, nor do you have a proper separation of the bullet head
plane-crazy 2019-05-15 04:12:59 It won't, that's not how the explosions work, I've tried it on my Wyvern and it's not how it works
plane-crazy 2019-05-15 04:12:38 Won't work
plane-crazy 2019-05-15 04:10:45 Not half bad Turismo
plane-crazy 2019-05-15 04:08:41 I mean you Colonel, who the hell else would I mean
plane-crazy 2019-05-15 04:08:34 ......
plane-crazy 2019-05-15 04:07:40 SHOW, US
plane-crazy 2019-05-15 04:07:08 ... Show us
plane-crazy 2019-05-15 04:06:56 <@!364352162563883008>
plane-crazy 2019-05-15 04:06:38 Which one?
plane-crazy 2019-05-15 04:06:28 And I will double and triple check it
plane-crazy 2019-05-15 04:06:13 Yes <@!202959294705041408> , that is true, but I expect literally every single movement
plane-crazy 2019-05-15 03:46:54 ALSO HOW THE FUCK DOES THAT HAVE A HIGHER RATING THAN PLANE CRAZY!?
plane-crazy 2019-05-15 03:46:47 I mean, I guess
plane-crazy 2019-05-15 03:46:32 Well, more like 70% of the time, but still
plane-crazy 2019-05-15 03:46:21 Depends, 99% of the time, yes
plane-crazy 2019-05-15 03:23:06 Grav, test a rocket engine vs super rocket
plane-crazy 2019-05-15 03:22:57 Also why does that wing design make me think of a butterfly's wings <@206891768233328640> ?
plane-crazy 2019-05-15 03:22:38 Basically Spy
plane-crazy 2019-05-15 03:22:13 Test everything vs everything, now I'm genuinely curious what's heavier than what in terms of relativity
plane-crazy 2019-05-15 03:21:56 HUH
plane-crazy 2019-05-15 03:21:52 Or, whatever it's called?
plane-crazy 2019-05-15 03:21:47 Wait seriously? And you tested this with a sea-saw?
plane-crazy 2019-05-15 03:19:00 Hi Battleship
plane-crazy 2019-05-15 03:18:19 <#519624169730605086> , but you likely need a rank from <#544022464133595166> first to prove that you actually invest time in-game
plane-crazy 2019-05-15 03:17:18 Don't forget, it occupies 2 blocks worth of space
plane-crazy 2019-05-15 03:13:38 Dunno, care to test it out for us? The seats should be equal weight, so just adjust ballast on both ends until they float equally
plane-crazy 2019-05-15 00:43:26 Blame Roblox, not us, also I'd suggest shifting around your stuff, like everything
plane-crazy 2019-05-14 20:37:03 Space engineers, you built a Yamato from Starcraft
plane-crazy 2019-05-14 16:46:25 I'll leave it up there though, see if people want to put the effort in
plane-crazy 2019-05-14 16:45:45 <@!308156968550268928> , While I would like to think we could do all these awareness campaigns, sadly it'd be hard to represent some of them
plane-crazy 2019-05-14 16:31:57 Used to love the crap outa that game, even though at the time, I wasn't exactly the best pilot
plane-crazy 2019-05-14 16:31:24 Anyone remember Plane Wars?
plane-crazy 2019-05-14 16:31:01 I mean, old styles were sorta it's theme, and who's to say old games are bad games?
plane-crazy 2019-05-14 16:30:26 It is
plane-crazy 2019-05-14 16:30:19 Er, how though? Like, did someone throw you to that door?
plane-crazy 2019-05-14 16:29:46 Although I haven't seen a Roblox-wide conversion yet, probably because it's presumably VERY LAGGY
plane-crazy 2019-05-14 16:29:13 Speaking of Future is Bright, I've been seeing it on alot more places recently, looks fantastic if done right
plane-crazy 2019-05-14 01:30:47 Did you click the green plane icon to fly?
plane-crazy 2019-05-14 01:30:18 Wings, there's a control surface
plane-crazy 2019-05-14 01:29:35 Check the controls, see if they're inverted, and if they're auto-controls, use the mouse
plane-crazy 2019-05-14 01:24:19 Everything else, tinker with and see what it does
plane-crazy 2019-05-14 01:24:12 I'd say just skip through, the landing gear's mostly aesthetic, and you just need the purple screwdriver to set up controls, also a main pilot seat
plane-crazy 2019-05-14 01:23:21 It's pretty broken, you're most of the way through though
plane-crazy 2019-05-14 01:02:11 That was before Voxel started cracking down on them, I'm not sure if he's gonna fix that or not, but for now just know that it's not gonna be a thing
plane-crazy 2019-05-14 00:59:28 Custom roles ain't allowed, even as jokes, sorry
plane-crazy 2019-05-13 23:40:28 It wasn't the worst, but just so nobody gets pissed off I'll just wipe it
plane-crazy 2019-05-13 23:40:17 Problem is people get VERY pissy over the slightest of spoilers, sooo, yeah
plane-crazy 2019-05-13 23:39:58 Don't worry about it
plane-crazy 2019-05-13 23:39:40 .... Uhhh, yeah no I'm wiping that temporarily
plane-crazy 2019-05-13 23:39:30 It's just a ton of memes, although, <@!551557693354147850> , mind if I erase that?
plane-crazy 2019-05-13 00:34:21 It'd be nice if he could work on updates constantly, but that's completely inhumane
plane-crazy 2019-05-13 00:34:01 Hey, he needs a break sometimes, he's not a machine
plane-crazy 2019-05-13 00:25:21 I mean, to be honest, as far as I've seen so far, it's gotten the reaction I needed, which is to shock and halt people from doing what they're doing
plane-crazy 2019-05-13 00:24:26 Although at the same time, Danny does have a point, and the reason why is because, it's either common courtesy or common sense
plane-crazy 2019-05-13 00:24:09 I mean, it's human nature to remember the most negative parts
plane-crazy 2019-05-13 00:21:31 Just feel glad that I'm the most open for feedback, mostly so I can improve myself, now cite specifically what the problem is
plane-crazy 2019-05-13 00:20:59 ... Seriously Malicious?
plane-crazy 2019-05-12 20:33:04 <@!267010494030807042> , Freaking rule 2's a thing, we need to enforce that, otherwise we'll get shot down by Roblox
plane-crazy 2019-05-12 20:32:25 Right can we move on from this?
plane-crazy 2019-05-12 20:31:54 Just, point is they're gonna take action against him
plane-crazy 2019-05-12 20:31:09 Let me put it this way, and let me be blunt, if someone posted a picture of a nude guy in a school, what do you think would happen to the person that posted it?
plane-crazy 2019-05-12 20:30:04 Depends, it ranges from an IP ban with VPN prevention, to a potential cease and desist, maybe even being fined and jailed for spreading NSFW stuff to people underage
plane-crazy 2019-05-12 20:29:30 Er, not a screenshot, unless we don't delete the message
plane-crazy 2019-05-12 20:29:10 TL;DR: Discord staff won't take action unless we actually have a screenshot
plane-crazy 2019-05-12 20:28:49 <@456226577798135808> , IGNORE IT
plane-crazy 2019-05-12 07:47:31 Jail, can you PLEASE take over for me
plane-crazy 2019-05-12 07:47:20 __***AHEM***__
plane-crazy 2019-05-12 07:43:35 <@!519250434976776241> , just be nice and pretend no arguments happened, that's all
plane-crazy 2019-05-12 07:43:18 Now good freaking night
plane-crazy 2019-05-12 07:43:12 Just don't coax the other person on, and if one of you coax the other on I swear
plane-crazy 2019-05-12 07:42:46 <@!260544767446745088> , YOU TO
plane-crazy 2019-05-12 07:42:31 <@!519250434976776241> , I SAID CAN YOU CUT IT OUT, I DON'T CARE WHO STARTED IT I WANT YOU BOTH TO END IT
plane-crazy 2019-05-12 07:42:15 Right, talk about timezones or new parts or something, now goodnight, I'm tired as crap, <@!468207489524039680> , take over and make sure there's no arguments, AGAIN
plane-crazy 2019-05-12 07:41:40 Cake, it's called timezones
plane-crazy 2019-05-12 07:41:22 I don't care who started it, just both of you end it please, it's 3:41 AM over here
plane-crazy 2019-05-12 07:40:55 Can you two quit butting heads before I smash them together into a bloody mess? (All metaphorically of course)
plane-crazy 2019-05-12 07:40:38 .....
plane-crazy 2019-05-12 07:40:10 I know it's all freaking over the place, I'm TRYING to fix that
plane-crazy 2019-05-12 07:39:49 Kompaktt
plane-crazy 2019-05-12 07:39:46 ........
plane-crazy 2019-05-12 07:39:18 Just, tone it back Kompaktt, seriously
plane-crazy 2019-05-12 07:38:47 Some guy appealed him, so I decided to unban him
plane-crazy 2019-05-12 07:38:35 I just realized I never changed the note on him
plane-crazy 2019-05-12 07:38:14 FFS
plane-crazy 2019-05-12 07:38:08 .... Oh wait nevermind
plane-crazy 2019-05-12 07:37:58 <@!260544767446745088> , Shut it, I'm surprised you got unbanned, I DON'T make notes on people unless I ban them, and when I ban them, I ban them for a very valid reason
plane-crazy 2019-05-12 07:37:22 There's plenty of times where there's context, infact there are a couple of times where that would've been a proper context
plane-crazy 2019-05-12 07:36:46 Right, the problem is they're entirely out of context
plane-crazy 2019-05-12 07:36:38 ...........
plane-crazy 2019-05-12 07:36:20 Cake, the fuck you call this then?
plane-crazy 2019-05-12 07:35:33 <@!519250434976776241> , <#495286269459300364> , __***NOW***__
plane-crazy 2019-05-12 07:35:17 I have a damn note on you <@!260544767446745088>
plane-crazy 2019-05-12 07:35:12 Wait
plane-crazy 2019-05-12 07:34:48 <@!260544767446745088> ...
plane-crazy 2019-05-12 07:33:50 <@!519250434976776241> , Gifs in <#495286269459300364>
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 02:29:05 That might work, I'm gonna check a video to see what it's like, and how accurately you nail it
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 02:28:42 You mean the primary gun on a battleship?
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 02:27:35 Er, "batter" gun, you mean "Battleship" gun?
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 02:26:15 I'm not entirely sure Battleship
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 02:25:18 ?
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 02:25:17 Don't worry about it
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 02:25:02 <@438884464060399630> , If we could think up of an original build, well it's not really original now is it?
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 02:23:50 Agoraphobia is the fear of large spaces I think
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 02:23:38 It's not strictly NSFW Danny, but it's suggestive as fuck if anything
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 02:23:20 But if that pops up again Gerardo I'm gonna lynch you, got it?
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 02:23:08 I'm going to pretend I didn't see that
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 02:23:03 It wasn't specifically NSFW
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 02:22:48 "Fuck My Life", I saw that Gerardo ...
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 02:22:22 FML <@!417295378401198080> ...
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 02:22:11 I think it's insectophobia
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 19:28:01 I wonder which mod's the most liked
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 19:07:46 Oh, look at the date it was posted on
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 19:07:10 That is actually pretty loud <@!340543153922768906>
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 19:06:53 FFS, just, I don't even know
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 19:06:27 Okay okay okay fine at least note it down that you're doing something
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 19:06:18 No, it's moreso I did so
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 19:05:46 Can you please ease up on the soundboard
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 19:05:37 <@!260797229068058634> !
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 19:00:48 While something like that wouldn't give you inventor, it'd probably give modeler, because let's face it, it's gonna be a PAIN to do so
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 19:00:10 What'd be cool is a proper lock, something like this http://static.howstuffworks.com/gif/lock-picking-cylinder.jpg
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 18:58:15 We had multiple confirmed cases
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 18:58:06 Yeup, it is
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 18:57:55 web.roblox is if you're under 13 years old, www.roblox is if you're over 13 years old
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 18:57:37 If it does that then you're under 13 years old
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 18:56:39 1: The username part in the upper right
2: URL
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 18:56:23 There's 2 dead giveaways
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 18:55:18 Basically if you're under 13 years old, and you're using Discord, parental permission or not, you're breaking the law
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 18:55:06 That's the primary way we catch people under 13 years of age, which, after a Discord Terms of Service update, is LITERALLY ILLEGAL
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 18:54:43 You're clear, I just needed to check
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 18:50:54 Now then Flauwe, don't beat around the bush, show us that page
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 18:50:38 It's gone now Neutronium, don't worry
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 18:50:28 ........ No, I only go incognito mode because I feel comfortable using it
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 18:49:54 Yeah, someone likely put that on after a string of poor or sub-par suggestions
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 18:49:34 Let me just fix that, you know the drill for suggestions, right?
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 18:49:24 Uhhhh, might've been a bad set of suggestions in the past Neutronium

plane-crazy 2019-05-10 18:45:32 Sorry Kayn, it's just, it's taken a bit too far
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 18:45:25 Right right right, one last question
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 18:44:44 Sadly no
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 18:44:08 Okay to be 100% honest I'm tempted to not give this guy the rank because of the act he pulled off, but at the same time the sub's not half bad
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 18:43:22 You shouldn't have gotten attention in that way you know
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 18:43:14 ....
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 18:43:08 "@ (Username here)"
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 18:42:50 And if you want a rank, ping me for the rank, I'm pretty much 100% fine with pings as long as it's not harassing me
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 18:42:33 <@!320245850892795904> , Quit lying, quit harassing others, quit EVERYTHING, while it was a good laugh at first, it was irritating, especially since you were taking it way too far
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 18:40:59 ............... <@!320245850892795904> , Right, cut out the joke, now, and quit lying to us
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 18:40:28 That's why they're smart
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 18:40:21 Smart people build off of other people's developments
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 18:40:06 Smart people aren't smart because they're naturally smart

plane-crazy 2019-05-10 18:38:52 ...... Actually,
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 18:38:46 I was trying to get them to answer
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 18:38:36 Okay now you're definitely just trolling us
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 18:38:17 Now here's a question that everyone who's taken basic science courses (A prerequisite for practicing medicine) knows, how long does it take light to reach Earth?
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 18:37:27 Except 1: We can convert to the metric system
2: Many of us DO infact use the metric system, because __***BIG SPOILER!!!***__, alot of us aren't American!
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 18:35:43 You googled it
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 18:35:41 20 seconds
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 18:35:29 10 seconds have passed

plane-crazy 2019-05-10 18:34:08 If you're smart, then what's the sine and cosine of 1?
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 18:33:47 Austin Texas
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 18:33:44 Time's up, Austin
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 18:33:30 Capital of Texas, answer in 10 seconds or else you're googling it, go
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 18:33:04 1: You're trying to raise yourself above everyone else, to the point of getting special points, even if proven wrong
2: You're trying to harass everyone by trying to shut them up
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 18:32:09 Let me boil it down to you, so shut up for a moment and let me list it out
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 18:31:48 ?warn
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 18:31:44 So you got the Peso part correct, but which peso? There's multiple types
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 18:30:40 <@!320245850892795904> , Cut the lying
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 18:30:31 Ahah, you're mixing up your story
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 18:30:23 Beat you to the punch
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 18:29:29 Except in the real world they aren't a real thing, also, pesos aren't Chinese
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 18:28:26 ........... If that's a joke it's getting annoying, so shut it
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 18:28:04 You are smarter than us
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 18:28:02 Say
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 18:28:01 Do not
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 18:27:59 .... Ahem
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 18:27:44 There IS no off-topic Blackbird, general is now just whatever the current topic is
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 18:27:19 Not exactly true
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 18:26:53 FFS, let me explain it, things are exaggerated
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 18:26:39 Anyways, just, think before you say it, if you're not sure, ask a mod or one of the trusted people
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 18:26:23 But let me clarify one thing, Family Guy is not racist because it's literally a show about bad jokes played out, you're not SUPPOSED to see it as realistic
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 18:25:42 I mean, your life goals are up to you
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 18:25:02 ... Excuse me?
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 18:24:07 That's the running joke with it
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 18:23:38 You do realize that 99.9% of Family Guy things are ABSOLUTELY overly exaggerated, if not completely falsified for a joke
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 18:23:04 <@!320245850892795904> , That's a joke
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 18:22:55 Except that's a JOKE
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 18:22:23 Swears (Fuck, Shit, Damn, Crap), are allowed in limited quantities, and not in a hostile manner
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 18:22:05 Ahah, you're not the smartest Chinese person then, because my friend knew that
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 18:21:38 Alright then, if you're so smart, what's the sine of 1?
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 18:21:05 Second, that doesn't make you immune to punishments
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 18:20:48 First of all, my old roommate was Chinese, and he was ALOT smarter than you <@!320245850892795904>
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 18:20:10 Yes, you can't say that here
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 18:19:50 Also, Blackbird, wait a freaking moment!
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 18:19:45 Sorry, your volume's low, say that again Flauwe?
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 18:19:19 Sorry Black, just dealing with this
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 18:19:15 If you can't do it or say that infront of your boss, teacher or parents, don't say it in the server
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 18:19:01 Not Safe For Work to be exact
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 18:18:53 NSFW, to boil it down, means inappropriate for children
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 18:18:44 And I have a friend in Southeast Asia who's brilliant at talking Flauwe
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 18:18:09 Yet you pretty much nailed one right on the damn head ...
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 18:18:01 That should be common sense <@!320245850892795904> , if you don't know them, you shouldn't be able to mention them

plane-crazy 2019-05-10 02:47:03 With that, it blends with alot of stuff
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 02:46:11 I mean, with mine, you see that silhouette in the sky and you either tremble in fear or cheer in glory
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 02:45:48 Ehhhhh, yeah no it just blends way too well together
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 02:44:39 Like, we will not see another one like it, PERIOD
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 02:44:33 It sorta blends in with the other airships in my memory, if you want modeler, you need to make it UNIQUE
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 02:44:12 Meh, I've gotta agree with them
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 02:43:17

plane-crazy 2019-05-09 01:50:47 Er, moreso hotline? I don't know, a connection to them
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 01:50:39 Hence why if someone starts acting very abnormally, I'll leave a message to them via DMs
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 01:50:17 Someone was booted before, turned out they were hacked at the time, so they used the landline I left, and they rejoined the server once they fought off the guy
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 01:48:14 ..... Uhhhhh
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 01:48:09 We don't care, you're allowed in as long as you follow the rules
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 01:47:54 You know you can just sit in the server as a person, even if you quit the game, right?
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 01:47:28 ... The fuck are you trying to do?
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 01:36:52 I would've added another 9 to it, but I don't think Dyno would've liked that
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 01:36:41 Oh
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 01:36:22 Which one?
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 01:35:54 To be honest that's actually a pretty good sign of the engine power
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 01:31:48 "SHIIIIIT, FULL REVERSE!!"
plane-crazy 2019-05-08 22:23:56 <@237359768405147649> , Those are speed wobbles, you can only counteract them by reducing lag
plane-crazy 2019-05-08 05:56:24 Wait, is that you modeling it shin?

plane-crazy 2019-05-07 23:16:52 ?unban 260544767446745088 Petittioned by a friend, seems to have calmed down, or so their friend says
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 22:47:43 Can we just drop this? I'm not in the mood to cut down someone else if they spark an argument
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 22:47:18 I'm just, really on edge here, sorry
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 22:47:04 ... <@!518187868347170818> ***Yeeeees?***
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 22:46:36 Get that through your heads people (This is to anyone who hasn't done so already), it doesn't matter what tools you have, but how you use them
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 22:46:16 It's not the ideology that makes you bad, it's what you do with it
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 22:46:07 TL;DR on what he sent, I disagreed with him saying that communism and naziism was bad, simply because you were associated with them
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 22:45:33 I portrayed the statement he posted in my screenshots by the way, along with more context ...
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 22:44:22 You know what fuck this, taking executive action

plane-crazy 2019-05-07 22:26:59 God, can we talk about something else? I'm freaking going to loose it at this rate
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 22:26:41 ALL OF YOU CUT IT OUT
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 22:26:37 .............
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 22:26:25 Katze, it depends
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 22:26:00 If he DMs any of you anything rude, I'm going to unmute and warn him

plane-crazy 2019-05-07 22:23:56 Guys, cut it out, talk about something freaking else
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 22:23:37 .............
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 22:23:30 SHUT IT, that's as close to what it actually is as I'm getting to
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 22:23:14 Can't I have a fucking nice day for once in my life?

plane-crazy 2019-05-07 22:22:36 "Bruh", nothing, even if it's a joke, it's still racist, namely the "school shooting" thing
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 22:21:23 .....
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 22:21:04 ?
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 20:51:49 Or be able to point out WHY it's bad
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 18:56:46 Like, do stuff with it
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 18:55:16 Blackbird, your mechanism's close, but you need to do more with it
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 18:51:12 Black, wait for it, it's gonna take a while

plane-crazy 2019-05-07 18:50:40 It's mostly unsuccessful, but I have
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 18:48:39 Yeeeeup
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 18:36:18 Just note that if you get inventor, we have every right to take it away should we find contradictory information
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 18:36:04 Inventor thing? We're debating it
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 18:35:55 ?
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 18:34:50 It's not the worst, but it's not the best either
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 18:27:29 I'd imagine that it lowers the center of lift so it has more of an effect on the pitch, and causes a downwards pitch, correct?
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 18:24:55 Including the rear section?
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 18:23:52 That's why I always finish the primary shape of the craft, or at least equalize it, before testing flight capabilities, then I give an estimate on what I need to do to improve it
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 18:23:30 Mega, use RCS, balance out the weight using heavier materials, and actually finish the design, many designs are actually far more balanced if tested fully
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 01:23:34 Make sure to check <#507673335816126509> , the pins specifically

plane-crazy 2019-05-06 19:38:58 __***AHEM***__
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 19:38:33 Wasn't me I'll tell you that much
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 19:33:58 It's this, but completely uncultured and full of kids that don't grasp how to leftclick (Literally at one point), what did you expect?
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 19:29:49 Example (There's 3 parameters in this):
And: T/T/F = F, F/F/F = F, T/T/T = T
Or: T/F/F = T, T/F/T = T, F/F/F = F
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 19:28:27 A logic gate requires sensors to work, they're if, and, or, xor, etc gates, that trigger when one or more, or none parameters are active
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 19:25:54 Because clearly these idiots are just gonna keep on mucking up stuff for everyone else
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 19:25:38 You know, maybe we need a PR guy to fix this
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 19:25:29 Nah, a cardboard box

plane-crazy 2019-05-06 19:23:16 It serves no purpose other than being a tiny tip jar
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 19:23:06 A tip jar, that's literally it
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 19:22:51 They do realize that there's a version of Plane Crazy that's set to the older days, right?
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 19:21:47 I swear it was jetbuilder that raged needlessly

plane-crazy 2019-05-06 03:13:01 <@!574773082237960202> , done
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 03:12:08 I'm giving you 30 seconds to erase that, NOW
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 03:10:57 <@!432145000327938049> , OY!
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 01:23:23 We try to maintain it with your primary account, sorry
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 01:10:37 1: It's not NSFW
2: <#495286269459300364> exists you know
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 01:08:49 No, but whyyyy did you post it here?
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 00:59:05 
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 00:58:28 Yeah, Empire, lay off of it, you nearly jumped on the bandwagon to
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 00:58:21 I am __***TIRED***__ here, but anyways
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 00:58:13 fuck
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 00:58:12 Empire
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 00:58:11 Er
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 00:58:09 Imperial, lay off of it
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 00:57:51 Linh, you wanna make the conversion to Boslaviet?
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 00:57:21 It's a good thing I was here to reign you in before you booted lego, AGAIN
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 00:57:11 IMPERIAL, THIS IS WHY WE DOUBLE CHECK
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 00:57:01 ...... -Facepalm-
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 00:56:29 We have people leaking all the time, could be coincidence
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 00:56:14 Uhhhhh, you're sure of this, right?
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 00:56:04 .... Ah
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 00:36:46 I'm guessing it has more grip? Try sliding it and seeing what happens compared to another block
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 00:35:32 Take a guess what you think it does, a wild one if you need to
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 00:33:52 I guess I played TOO much tank
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 00:33:40 No thanks, burned out to hell with DQ here
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 00:28:38 The fuck is nitro typing?
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 00:27:58 Basically it opens up to reveal a MASSIVE gun
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 00:27:38 Curly, scifi battleship focused on a hidden spinal gun
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 00:27:25 RIP, at least Turismo will respawn once you walk away
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 00:26:13 Like 99% of us know
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 00:19:03 ... Okay thanks for proving that test doesn't work Lego (No seriously thanks), right, now then
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 00:18:23 Buffalo, buffalo, buffalo, buffalo, buffalo, buffalo buffalo buffalo
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 00:17:33 Yeah those WPM scores aren't yours jacob, you've shown no evidence that you can even have enough mental activity in order to reach double digit WPMs
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 00:16:34 So "Peter Piper" would be "pETER pIPER"
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 00:16:19 Wroooong, I said capslock on, meaning you repeat the message, except inverse everything
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 00:15:40 <@!384516066665299968> ...... Cut it out
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 00:14:40 Words Per Minute
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 00:14:11 Alright then <@!384516066665299968> , you wanna prove you got that WPM? Recite the first 5 rules in <#533294912586645521> , except do so with capslock on
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 00:12:54 Ah, ouch, can't
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 00:12:37 What level lego?
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 00:12:21 ....... Just the fuck are you talking about jacob? There's literally 0 context ...
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 00:11:11 Jacob, I doubt that you got the WPM scores you did in <#495286269459300364> , because you can't prove it now
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 00:10:30 Compare friction blocks to ice blocks then
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 00:10:23 When WELDED onto another block, it does nothing, but when it touches the ground, it's fine
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 00:10:06 Maybe you aren't using it in the correct way, the friction block is supposed to provide extra friction compared to other blocks
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 00:09:31 Of course it works ...
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 00:09:15 Why, did you post it here, when it was out of context?
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 00:08:38 ............. Just, what context does that have exactly <@!384516066665299968> ?
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 00:05:59 Probably VIP server
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 00:04:24 If this is a joke, it's an awful one that's making everyone frustrated
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 00:04:06 What do you even have to counterclaim about?
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 00:03:34 Then act like you're okay, one of my nephews, who's fucking 4, can spell better than you can
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 00:02:59 RIP Brick
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 00:02:35 But Jacob, we already said what it does ...
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 00:02:25 Not sure Brick, ask someone to build a platform for you
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 00:02:15 ... You're on psychadelics
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 00:01:37 Jacob, answer, now, how damn old are you?
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 00:01:21 I only unblocked him so I could get an easier time taking that screenshot
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 00:01:02 ...
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 00:00:01 .... Jacob, let me ask you honestly, what sort of psychedelics are you on?
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 23:59:40 He's on my blocked list, but that was before I took notes, so I'm 99.9% sure he was banned for something, and I was the one that did it
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 23:58:56 Apparently you're "lazy" enough to want a block, which you don't HAVE to use, be removed
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 23:58:13 Jacob, if friction wasn't a thing, you wouldn't be able to go anywhere, literally
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 23:57:05 We have Google you know
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 23:16:31 Tiny flag on the center mast?
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 19:34:54 Yeup
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 19:34:10 I wonder if someone could make one of those weird perspective art things, where if you look at it one way, it shows one picture, but if you look at it another way, it shows another picture
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 19:30:24 <@!421848903361757184> , I gave you everything back, also not a problem
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 19:29:06 I think they'll still be there
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 19:28:12 And Colonel, it'll show up with the note
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 19:28:07 Yeah it does wipe the chat Imperial
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 19:27:15 Er, unblock me temporarily? I need to send the link
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 19:26:52 God I'm beyond tired here
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 19:26:47 God fucking, wrong person! hold on
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 19:26:21 Wait for him to say he's ready
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 19:26:17 WAIT!
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 19:26:13 It's a one-use code
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 19:26:04 I gave him  an invite code, if this doesn't work, friend request me and DM me Lego
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 19:25:23 Hold on
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 19:24:32 Right, both of you are logged down, are you STILL volunteering?
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 19:24:26 
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 19:24:15 
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 19:23:53 Wait they don't? Oh
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 19:23:38 Bans wipe the chat
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 19:23:36 That's a bad idea
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 19:23:32 Wait no
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 19:23:31 Lego volunteered for it and I'm recording his ranks down
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 19:23:22 Hidear, you wanted to test if someone you blocked could ban you
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 19:23:09 God, freaking, effing, save the roles first
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 19:23:01 WAAAIIIIIIT!!!!
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 19:22:31 Jesus effing christ
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 19:22:27 Er HOLD ON HOLD ON
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 19:22:02 Nooot true Hidear, care to be a test subject?
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 19:20:48 Okay okay okay cut it out
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 19:20:03 Distinct features in certain races? Like, I know some bugs have massively different males and females
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 19:14:10 Literally the largest build I have in there's about 59 parts, and that was the wall with wheels
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 19:13:36 I already mentioned Rick, it's fine, I can rebuild them in seconds anyways
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 18:33:16 The thing is, for every action there's an equal and opposite reaction, use front wheel drive to counteract that
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 17:55:20 I mean, it's literally about 7-8 blocks with a cross of control surfaces at the front and back, and a super rocket in the back
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 17:54:52 The plane I built was just a scrap one for testing purposes, I didn't really put any real effort into it
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 17:54:26 ?
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 15:45:00 <@!249373398612967441> , You got it
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 15:42:24 I have no idea then
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 15:42:11 Wait, seriously? Including the block connections?
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 15:41:18 <@!249373398612967441> , Try using a ton of mini-ropes combined together into one big rope
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 15:39:43 Don't look at us, we can't adjust ranks
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 15:38:31 At least most of the time that I've seen
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 15:38:17 The OTHERS however don't
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 15:38:09 Er, sorry Katze, when I ban people I always grab their ranks
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 15:37:42 Saved his ranks
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 15:36:40 He seems to get up late at night, at least as far as I can tell
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 15:35:47 I mean, to be honest, why do people panic when they ping me, you need to have 3 criteria line up at the same time to piss me off with a ping, and that's
1: I'm pissed off during the day
2: You have to have pissed me off recently, and I mean REALLY have done so
3: It's spammed repeatedly or with insults directed at me
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 15:34:24 It's fine
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 15:33:49 Madness
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 15:33:04 Colonel, HE can say hi because he doesn't breathe down my neck at the first moment to say hi to me
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 15:32:47 Okay okay okay no more pings before this goes out of control
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 15:32:28 Riiiip, welp
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 15:32:01 Hi battleship, tired and a bit freaked out to heck
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 15:31:40 Every single TIME I COME ON, it's irritating and creepy at this point
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 15:31:14 COLONEL LEAVE ME THE FUCK ALONE FOR THE LOVE OF DAMNNATION, seriously, why do you think I remain silent in this server?
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 15:30:44 Hold on, can you not ping her Imperial?
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 15:30:38 Whaaaaat?
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 05:18:28 Ace pilot's been removed from acquisition, it's only circulating around because people have gotten it before
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 05:17:56 Right, music back on, enjoy yourselves, and DON'T try to have any crazy antics in here, otherwise I'm going to come swinging with a ban hammer to someone's unfortunate face
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 05:17:20 Do not tarnish my name with anything, got it? I'm really tired now
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 05:17:06 ......................
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 05:16:45 I'll turn the music on once someone catches me up on what's going on
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 05:16:25 Sam, Colonel, shut up FFS
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 05:16:20 Right, catch me up now ...
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 05:16:11 THE FUCK IS GOING ON HERE!?
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 04:14:47 1: Shut it, I wasn't the one that unmuted him
2: There was a valid reason to mute him, it's just that he keeps on BEGGING whenever he does something wrong, or pretending to back down
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 04:08:10 She never said you were immature, period
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 04:07:41 Katze, Sam, cut it out, especially you Sam
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 03:35:05 Block choice, it needs to float, and money limitation
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 03:34:06 Probably because WFYB has people trolling these builds, and stricter limitations
plane-crazy 2019-05-04 22:18:15 Good, I'll bug you if your temper goes a bit out of control
plane-crazy 2019-05-04 22:17:04 Try to maintain your temper this time Katze
plane-crazy 2019-05-04 22:13:19 FFS
plane-crazy 2019-05-04 22:13:15 ;update <@486674992981999648>
plane-crazy 2019-05-04 20:30:31 To be honest I don't care that Inferno's hacking, 
1: He's not hacking maliciously
2: He's one of us, sooo
plane-crazy 2019-05-04 20:15:03 A friend with a sub-par computer came on and tested little to no lag within the server, material parts are fine but could use a bit more of a transparency spike, as some materials obscure this very well, however, there is a weird wheel wobble going on
plane-crazy 2019-05-04 19:47:46 I'm gonna invite a friend, is that fine?
plane-crazy 2019-05-04 19:46:26 Basically I'm a bit sick
plane-crazy 2019-05-04 19:46:06 Bit under the weather, but I'm willing to try
plane-crazy 2019-05-04 19:45:23 -Cue the flood of art projects on Plane Crazy-
plane-crazy 2019-05-04 19:40:39 What about reflectivity? I know some of my crafts could use some polish
plane-crazy 2019-05-04 03:53:20 If you're spawning in the wrong seat, the main pilot seat is your spawn point when you enter flight mode
plane-crazy 2019-05-04 03:53:02 If you're spawning inside of your creation, it shouldn't do that, it spawns you at the center of your plot, at the highest point that's 100% unoccupied
plane-crazy 2019-05-04 03:52:39 What do you mean?
plane-crazy 2019-05-04 03:29:15 No idea, sorry
plane-crazy 2019-05-04 03:27:26 Maybe not as gold as these things, but still https://www.mariowiki.com/images/thumb/a/a4/GoldenMushroomMK8.png/1200px-GoldenMushroomMK8.png
plane-crazy 2019-05-04 03:27:00 IRL it's probably poisonous as shit, but if you know anything about Mario, you know that these suckers are freaking gold
plane-crazy 2019-05-04 03:25:59 Here, have this https://www.mariowiki.com/images/thumb/b/b4/1-Up_Mushroom_Artwork_-_Super_Mario_3D_World.png/200px-1-Up_Mushroom_Artwork_-_Super_Mario_3D_World.png
plane-crazy 2019-05-04 03:25:13 __***GOD***__ I'm tired
plane-crazy 2019-05-04 03:25:00 It's fine Con
plane-crazy 2019-05-04 03:24:56 Press escape and use that screenshot?
plane-crazy 2019-05-04 03:24:31 God damn it, I'm trying to make him learn, that way he'll be able to figure out solutions on his own alot more aptly
plane-crazy 2019-05-04 03:23:41 Figure it out
plane-crazy 2019-05-04 03:22:17 Any ladder that'd fit inside a single block won't work, plus we have blocks that can form ladders on their own if placed correctly
plane-crazy 2019-05-04 03:21:52 <@!559180331580915754> , Nope
plane-crazy 2019-05-04 03:21:48 We don't accept smartasses that don't read the rules, I'm going to pretend I saw nothing, and I'd advise you cut the crap
plane-crazy 2019-05-04 03:21:02 Try that again, I dare you
plane-crazy 2019-05-04 03:20:51 ... <@456226577798135808> Excuse me?
plane-crazy 2019-05-04 03:20:37 Make one yourself Thunder, figure out how
plane-crazy 2019-05-04 03:18:14 Tinker around, figure it out yourself (I say that mostly so you can benefit long term)
plane-crazy 2019-05-04 02:42:27 Hi
plane-crazy 2019-05-04 02:42:20 <@!559180331580915754> 
1: You need ranks
2: Already suggested
3: <#384027830192832513> for that
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 18:40:15 Oh
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 18:39:46 Vixo, just send the screenshot
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 18:36:46 Don't think I got yours <@272125457703501826> , sorry
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 18:28:20 We try to reset VIP server links monthly so whoever's leaking them won't have a valid link for more than a month
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 18:26:37 Gerardo, it's sorta about the maturity
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 18:26:03 At the same time though you act worse than some 8 year olds I've met Albert ...
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 18:25:45 He claims to be, and has screenshots that show he's over 13
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 18:24:36 ... Albert, you're not helping either
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 18:24:08 Gerardo, be nice
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 18:24:04 "im not" ...
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 18:23:16 Oh shut up <@!556913127917223967>
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 18:22:37 That should be everything, I removed a redundant rank since you had one that was superior
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 18:20:56 ... 1: You don't threaten me, or at the very least you don't say things in a threatening way to me
2: Next time shape yourself up and this won't be a problem
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 16:57:54 Yeah, blame Discord for that, take another pic?
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 16:56:11 -Insert sonic spring SFX here-
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 16:55:19 Not a problem
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 16:55:05 I technically am because he owned the roles beforehand, so
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 16:54:35 So yeah I might be a tiny bit pissy today, a "tiny" bit
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 16:54:25 Joey, I caught that as well
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 16:54:20 I was woken up by a fire alarm, giving me effectively 4 hours of sleep
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 16:54:04 Er, as in, I fixed your ranks
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 16:53:57 Got it!
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 16:53:21 Oh FFS let me double check
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 16:52:53 I believe so
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 16:51:49 Fuck a duck in the face with a mallet, there, your ranks are fixed Joey
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 16:47:36 Nope, Mig-19 wasn't WW2
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 16:38:02 If you could send the screenshot over that'd be nice
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 16:37:54 Thanks Tornado
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 16:36:56 <@!251995895405477888> , that should be everything, fucking hell I already have a headache from multitasking
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 16:29:50 At the very least at that point there's a chance for them to take a hint and stop
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 16:29:39 Yet if you've been around for any extended period of time, you'd know that they'd get themselves in a bad situation anyways
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 16:28:24 Nuclear, I tend to mute people to shut them up for their own good, so they don't blab on into getting themselves a pile of warns with a side of banning
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 16:25:55 Nuclear, just shut the fuck up already, you're causing nothing but problems, and I know if I mute you, you'll just go to DMs like anyone else
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 16:25:35 Cody, I have ample suspicion to do so because that's the exact phrase said instigator used in a very heated reddit post
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 16:25:13 Felipe, not quite how it works
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 16:24:48 Nuclear, shut up, I'm in contact with him now
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 16:24:19 Second, Cody, where exactly did you get that line? It seems __***AWFULLY***__ familiar, namely from a certain instigator who kept on making fights in the server
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 16:23:32 First of all, a ban's too extreme, his latest warns were 3 months ago
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 16:23:17 .......... Right, let me start fixing this, <@456226577798135808> , <@!381263178589536257> , both of you stay out of this
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 16:22:25 Don't attribute the actions of one as the norm for all
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 16:21:56 .... Care to explain <@456226577798135808> ?
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 16:21:47 God fucking, Imperial what did he do!? His last warns were 3 months ago, at least
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 16:21:26 .....................
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 16:21:12 Nuclear, shut up, seriously
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 16:21:04 Just leave it be for now
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 16:20:39 There's my answer
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 16:20:13 I've literally met 10 year olds that act more maturely than my own two god damn parents
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 16:19:40 Also yes I do tend to have some sense of humor nuclear, it's just that today I got woken up by a fire drill, so I have an effective 4 hours of sleep
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 16:19:09 I mean, to be honest I'm skeptical as well, but behavior alone isn't proof
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 16:18:35 .......... Wait is he seriously under 13?
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 16:18:21 You do realize that that's a mod's job, not the other way around, right?
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 16:17:47 I mean, maybe he speed read them?
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 16:17:26 Again, I will not confirm or deny that
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 16:17:08 Nah, only do those if they're REALLY toxic to everyone
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 16:17:00 I will not confirm or deny that nuclear
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 16:16:52 It's HALF advertising, sorta
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 16:16:47 I mean, guys
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 16:16:36 <@!556913127917223967> , No
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 16:16:27 ............
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 16:16:26 You do realize that I'm n-
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 16:15:13 <@!184819059404046336> , That would mean that you're underage
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 16:14:50 .......
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 16:14:11 I was about to say "Nobody reads ToS", but if it's the first thing, they do tend to catch it
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 16:13:49 1: Parents permission or not, you can not be under 13 years of age and use Discord
2: Kids can be tried as adults
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 16:12:46 ............. For the love of god, let me get a few things straight here guys
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 16:11:59 <@!431335776144588800> , It's literally illegal for people under 13 years of age to use Discord, with varrying consequences for both the people aware of it, and for the person under 13 as well
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 16:10:45 And again, if you do, I'd suggest you stop playing the game, many of the more awesome things require a higher degree of thought
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 16:10:25 If you do, white part to the blocks
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 16:10:15 ......... Do you seriously need us to answer such an obvious question?
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 16:09:56 Can you fucking not Tornado? It's irritating
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 16:09:42 ... <@!251995895405477888> , seriously?
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 16:08:56 I mean, we already took care of the situation, if he adds more alts in, we ban all of them
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 16:06:56 No, put it here
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 16:06:28 What <@!556913127917223967> ?
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 16:05:42 And yeah to be honest it is annoying <@!251995895405477888> , cut it out
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 16:05:32 More torque means more movement strength, which generally means more rotation speed
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 16:04:49 I'm going to track him down
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 16:04:41 Keken, show me
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 16:04:37 .... Daily reminder, it IS infact __***ILLEGAL***__ to be on Discord under 13 years old, even with parental permission, so for fuck's sake guys, if you're under 13, leave now, the repercussions will hit all of us if you don't
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 16:03:14 I think I know evan
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 16:03:08 Sab, FFS, wait
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 16:02:47 I mean, are they in this server? If so, who?
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 16:02:29 Which one?
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 16:02:12 Hey, Imperial's a good mod, so treat him like you'd treat me
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 16:00:17 Yeah that's fine, I'm just asking because we've had a few suspicious characters act under 13 years old, who turned out to be underage, and thus using Discord illegally
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 15:59:40 If not, then stay out of this
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 15:59:32 Colonel, do you even know what you're talking about? ...
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 15:59:13 Show your Roblox page, the upper right corner of your Roblox game GUI, or some other way
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 15:58:23 ........... Can you please confirm your age? We need to ask for legal reasons <@!431335776144588800>
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 15:58:02 Terrains, probably not, it's probably just going so fast that the refresh rate can't keep up with it
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 15:57:38 If you don't know what that is, you're probably fine
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 15:57:18 Meme videos go in <#495286269459300364> NSFW videos are not allowed in this server, period
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 15:57:02 What do you mean by that?
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 15:56:29 Right, what's the issue exactly, describe it in as much detail as possible
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 15:56:14 Jesus fucking, <@!556913127917223967> , can you calm down? Seriously
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 00:50:44 ........
plane-crazy 2019-05-02 23:51:18 .... <@!295246380547702786> , Keep that in the damn dump from now on
plane-crazy 2019-05-02 23:50:49 And that's it?
plane-crazy 2019-05-02 23:49:49 ... <@!295246380547702786> , THE FUCK DID YOU SEND, either show me what it is or I'm going to assume the worst case scenario
plane-crazy 2019-05-02 23:49:09 The fuck did he send?
plane-crazy 2019-05-02 23:46:18 Ask the people that have the rank how they've done it before (Don't ping them though ...)
plane-crazy 2019-05-02 23:45:43 ...... Asrominus, for the love of, I'm not your servant, plus it's not that hard to do unless you have a difficult time understanding basic aerodynamics
plane-crazy 2019-05-02 23:44:29 We've had 4 part creations that flew without helium before
plane-crazy 2019-05-02 23:43:57 Either you're lying, or whoever told you it is lying
plane-crazy 2019-05-02 23:43:49 You can't
plane-crazy 2019-05-02 23:43:07 Even if it's a euphemism or near NSFW, it's still too close to the sun there Icarus, now cut it out

plane-crazy 2019-04-30 22:54:56 Joey, scale that up and use larger wedges
plane-crazy 2019-04-30 22:53:35 Sorry Joey, dealing with two major things at once here (This included), start with a flat surface, I'd suggest something like 4 long, then use a 4X1, then a 3X1 that's infront, but 1 under, then 2X1, 1X1, then flip the wedges
plane-crazy 2019-04-30 22:51:27 Next to impossible, you can settle for really smooth wheels, but not perfectly smooth
plane-crazy 2019-04-30 22:50:08 Joey, you can leave them open honestly
plane-crazy 2019-04-30 22:47:50 RIP? Ouch
plane-crazy 2019-04-30 22:46:37 Just note: The core of the wheel doesn't matter, whether it's beams, blocks or whatever, the core doesn't matter, it's the outer rim that does
plane-crazy 2019-04-30 22:46:03 Tinker around a tiny bit and experiment, you'll learn more permanent knowledge that way
plane-crazy 2019-04-30 22:45:51 Joey, it's a simple act of wedges at different angles
plane-crazy 2019-04-30 22:43:58 Joey, the biggest cylinder available is a 3X3, but if you want to go bigger, use wedges of varrying degrees, the larger it is, the smoother it'll get
plane-crazy 2019-04-30 22:42:25 .......... Colonel, why are you so interested in it?
plane-crazy 2019-04-30 22:41:59 Alot of people at this point, earliest I remember was Empire I think
plane-crazy 2019-04-30 22:41:29 Just think of how a breach loading rifle works in real life, then replicate the steps
plane-crazy 2019-04-30 22:40:39 Yes, infact someone took it further and made a breach-loading rifle
plane-crazy 2019-04-30 22:39:47 Namely because the selection area would be problematic
plane-crazy 2019-04-30 22:39:37 Sadly we've batted this idea alot <@!249373398612967441> , and it'd be hard to script in
plane-crazy 2019-04-30 22:38:27 <@!249373398612967441> , Yes?
<@!202959294705041408> , Why me and nobody freaking else!?
<@!250393834817585162> , sadly I think that's already taken
plane-crazy 2019-04-30 22:33:59 That's, not a bad idea actually
plane-crazy 2019-04-30 22:33:04 Also, I don't think so, you could try what steam engines do, but I'm not sure if that's possible otherwise
plane-crazy 2019-04-30 22:32:50 Like someone trying to do an awful self-roleplay that nobody wants to hear?
plane-crazy 2019-04-30 22:27:44 I didn't mean he copied it piece for piece
plane-crazy 2019-04-30 22:27:33 ... Big ass engine, cockpit mounted in between two giant "tines", wings widen out near the back?

plane-crazy 2019-04-29 03:29:36 Colonel, can you freaking cut it out?
plane-crazy 2019-04-29 03:23:11 Not to be rude, but who are you?
plane-crazy 2019-04-29 03:22:30 Curly, try using a helium package for a rapid launch
plane-crazy 2019-04-29 03:17:19 Then outmaneuver them, so far I've not gotten downed even once by hostile attacks, even if they try to spawncamp me
plane-crazy 2019-04-29 03:16:19 Then counteract that by either going faster than them, or outmaneuvering them (Preferably both, which is what I do), and make sure to show your small target profile to them
plane-crazy 2019-04-29 03:14:36 That's the problem with larger creations, they're bigger and easier targets
plane-crazy 2019-04-29 03:13:56 And do I need to mention the damage capacity?
plane-crazy 2019-04-29 03:13:47 Extremely fast and maneuverable (As many people know), and can jam power into it's reverse thrust in order to pull off unique maneuvers
plane-crazy 2019-04-29 03:12:44 How good is it at avoiding hits though?
plane-crazy 2019-04-29 03:11:18 Curly, 2 solutions
1: Stop playing PVP
2: Build better, my Wyverns are durable enough to take a couple of rocket hits, but fast and small enough to evade almost all projectiles
plane-crazy 2019-04-29 03:08:40 You don't make sense, at all, and it's really annoying when you try to butt in thinking you know *juuuust how to solve a problem* ||Spoilers: you don't||
plane-crazy 2019-04-29 03:05:53 FFS, Colonel, fucking turn on your brain for something more than just terrible "memes" that don't even deserve to be put in that category
Anyways, yeah <@!572249765417451541> , please use the iron cross instead of a Swastika, people get VERY touchy when creations have swastikas on them, like extremely touchy, instant temper tantrum levels of touchy
plane-crazy 2019-04-29 03:02:53 Colonel, he's referring to the contest ...
plane-crazy 2019-04-29 03:00:21 You can post whatever you want in <#504436696021204992> , provided it's from Plane Crazy
plane-crazy 2019-04-29 02:59:37 Yeup, <#504436696021204992> is open though
plane-crazy 2019-04-29 02:59:04 In <#504436696021204992> , they'll be picked up by a bot and ported over to <#384025409945337856> , but if it fits the challenge, feel free to add it to <#504630474853974032>
plane-crazy 2019-04-29 02:56:02 You can vote multiple times, just don't be a scum about it
plane-crazy 2019-04-29 02:55:25 Yeah
plane-crazy 2019-04-29 02:55:06 Yeup, have fun, and please follow the rules, they're mostly human common sense
plane-crazy 2019-04-29 02:54:01 It's a server where we hang out and discuss Plane Crazy stuff, maybe do a couple of competitions, and suggest ideas to be implemented
plane-crazy 2019-04-29 01:15:08 Either build a rig to drag it to the water (The old way), or use the options to spawn it at the water
plane-crazy 2019-04-29 01:14:27 Work in what way? Be as specific as possible
plane-crazy 2019-04-29 01:13:59 Yes?
plane-crazy 2019-04-28 20:53:58 Who are you both exactly?
plane-crazy 2019-04-28 05:11:15 Unless it's a quote from an educational source that's in-context (Aka: We're talking about a historical event), with proper citation to said quote, it's not enough of a pass to get you out of trouble, and even then it's still a red-hot topic
plane-crazy 2019-04-28 02:46:29 Actually bothering to read the ranks ...
plane-crazy 2019-04-28 02:45:50 <@557015565374455808> , 
1: Quit begging, nobody wants to vote for a beggar (No seriously it's a recurring pattern)
2: You don't need upvotes for seamarshal ...
plane-crazy 2019-04-28 02:15:44 <@!325320982602448897> ..... I'll prooobably let that pass this time
plane-crazy 2019-04-28 01:41:41 I don't like modern jets and I think it looks really nice
plane-crazy 2019-04-28 01:41:28 Just how the hell is it chunky?
plane-crazy 2019-04-28 01:37:19 You can't, it's not a thing yet, and the difficulty of implementing it would mean that it's probably not coming for a long while
