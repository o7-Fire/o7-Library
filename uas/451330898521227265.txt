bug-reports 2019-12-13 18:27:39 Real shame that roblox does not let you add & remove thigns from the filter as a developer
bug-reports 2019-12-13 18:27:52 Or gives you the option to make glass not make water transparent
bug-reports 2019-12-13 21:28:25 Yeah
bug-reports 2019-12-13 21:28:28 I know that
bug-reports 2019-12-13 21:28:36 I have used roblox studio for quite a lot of time
creations-chat 2019-12-21 12:27:50 
creations-chat 2019-12-21 12:28:00 Built a jet fighter with lots of helium so it could take off

creations-chat 2020-04-10 23:43:39 Reading the down vote numbers make me depressed: are people really that ruthless?
creations-chat 2020-04-10 23:44:03 Lots of the totally downvoted creations look quite nice
creations-chat 2020-04-10 23:45:20 Yeah sadly lol
creations-chat 2020-04-10 23:45:39 I played blox just now for the first time
creations-chat 2020-04-10 23:45:51 It appears to be a stark contrast to this community lol
creations-chat 2020-04-10 23:45:57 Eh what can you do?
creations-chat 2020-04-10 23:46:18 At least the game is really good
creations-chat 2020-04-10 23:47:17 I wanna marry Motor 2
creations-chat 2020-04-10 23:47:41 Yeah, better than control panels
creations-chat 2020-04-10 23:48:45 Yeah
creations-chat 2020-04-10 23:49:13 Tho the more surface area on the control surface motor 3 you got, the better it is at creating drag
creations-chat 2020-04-11 23:25:44 Until you gain altitude
creations-chat 2020-04-13 10:02:14 So just upload and it automatically puts it on?
creations-chat 2020-04-13 10:02:22 Right k
creations-chat 2020-04-13 10:02:59 Fighter Jet (Too lazy to think up a name) - Just wanna see how well it does
creations-chat 2020-04-13 10:03:22 Now to get into the brace position
creations-chat 2020-04-13 10:08:34 You know what, have an A-10 as well, either way im not gonna get any good scores
creations-chat 2020-04-13 10:18:13 Probably
creations-chat 2020-04-13 10:18:27 Tbh though it does not perform too well so I may just replace it somepoint later
creations-chat 2020-04-13 10:18:43 Though I definitely got way more upvotes than I was expecting (more than 0)
creations-chat 2020-04-13 12:49:01 Roblox did that to stop you inputting roman numerals instead of numbers
creations-chat 2020-04-13 12:49:04 Which they dont allow either
creations-chat 2020-04-13 12:49:11 Certain numerals work but you cannot use most of them
creations-chat 2020-04-13 12:49:26 Tbh, the developers need to add a work around that lets you put in numbers
creations-chat 2020-04-13 12:49:41 Tho idk if the roblox filter allows it
creations-chat 2020-04-13 13:52:12 Lol the Germans are coming

the-dump 2020-05-18 19:33:41 C'mon its supposed to be a joke not some sort of serious application that you have to conform to the law by or something
the-dump 2020-05-18 19:36:56 hmmm
the-dump 2020-05-20 20:22:30 
the-dump 2020-05-20 20:22:41 When you want to trade discord account usernames but roblox brrts you with hashtags
the-dump 2020-05-21 19:28:26 ngl my whole attitude towards roblox removing outlines was just <:KEKW:670310537300672528>
creations-chat 2020-08-31 20:34:44 Thinking of coming up of something more original than an A-10, probably an A-1 Skyraider or something that has a turboprop
creations-chat 2020-08-31 20:42:42 Supra looks pretty sweet
creations-chat 2020-08-31 21:01:25 Homing missiles? how do you even make them work?
creations-chat 2020-08-31 21:01:38 Most of the missiles I seen just dont work well for air to air engagements
creations-chat 2020-08-31 21:02:22 Yep
creations-chat 2020-08-31 21:02:22 ^
creations-chat 2020-08-31 21:03:21 Oh, im guessing the missiles do not work without a camera
creations-chat 2020-08-31 21:03:53 I guess I should try harder when building guided missiles
creations-chat 2020-08-31 21:04:00 We could really do with some parts to create our own missiles tbh
creations-chat 2020-08-31 21:04:07 Its a shame it wont happen in this hard coded state
creations-chat 2020-08-31 21:05:47 Thanks, i'll definitely take a look at it
creations-chat 2020-08-31 21:06:16 Im assuming the rocket must be normal and not super
creations-chat 2020-08-31 21:06:35 Oh, awesome
creations-chat 2020-08-31 21:06:50 Most missiles I seen go bat***t out of control with super rockets
creations-chat 2020-08-31 21:07:03 Are these missiles mouse or keyboard guided
creations-chat 2020-08-31 21:15:16 Just dont bother honestly
creations-chat 2020-08-31 21:15:18 No point
creations-chat 2020-08-31 21:15:32 Dont bother telling roblox that
creations-chat 2020-08-31 21:15:33 They probably wont care
creations-chat 2020-08-31 21:15:38 They sure as hell do deal with false reports though
creations-chat 2020-08-31 21:15:40 And I just dont get it
creations-chat 2020-08-31 21:15:51 Okay
creations-chat 2020-08-31 21:15:55 Even the mention of it just gets me yeeted
creations-chat 2020-08-31 21:15:56 lol
creations-chat 2020-08-31 21:16:03 But someone had that word in the name
creations-chat 2020-08-31 21:16:10 And then when I reported them to roblox ages ago
creations-chat 2020-08-31 21:16:12 I got banned
creations-chat 2020-08-31 21:16:24 If anything the person whos gonna get banned is you so dont report lol
creations-chat 2020-08-31 21:17:23 I have a question, I am going to build an A-1 skyraider like aircraft to replace my A-10, does anyone have any tips for making the aircraft as survivable as possible?
creations-chat 2020-08-31 21:19:12 I personally dont see why people do it either but theres no point b*ing on about it
creations-chat 2020-08-31 21:19:31 Welp and in return
creations-chat 2020-08-31 21:19:36 We lost respect for you
creations-chat 2020-08-31 21:19:37 lol
creations-chat 2020-08-31 21:20:15 Yeah but you did it for something that is kinda pointless
creations-chat 2020-08-31 21:21:37 lmao
creations-chat 2020-08-31 21:21:37 This is dragging on over a word
creations-chat 2020-08-31 21:22:04 gay apparently
creations-chat 2020-08-31 21:22:05 lmao
creations-chat 2020-08-31 21:22:27 Bruh
creations-chat 2020-08-31 21:25:57 navumm im sorry but gay is just a word people use for insults, your just gonna have to accept it and move on, we are not changing how we use words. Dont get me wrong, im not homophobic by any stretch of the imagination but once again, its a common insult, sorry but thats just what it is.
creations-chat 2020-08-31 21:27:04 Oh nice, I live in the UK as well
creations-chat 2020-08-31 21:27:19 Yeah but most people just dont care about that
creations-chat 2020-08-31 21:27:26 Because they know the person using the word just isnt homophobic anyways
creations-chat 2020-08-31 21:27:47 Same
creations-chat 2020-08-31 21:27:57 I have a friend who is gay and uses it as a joking insult

the-dump 2020-08-31 21:34:50 Lets talk about the shredder bug:
the-dump 2020-08-31 21:34:54 I freaking hate it
bug-reports 2020-08-31 21:36:03 A full on map remake would be better than trying to mess with track that was clearly made for testing tbh. Perhaps in a rewrite in some fantasy
the-dump 2020-09-01 11:03:52 <@!564633856184156161> Hey, just wanted to say thanks for showing me your AA missiles

the-dump 2020-09-03 10:30:54 When someone asked him how he did it
the-dump 2020-09-03 10:30:58 He began asking for fucking money
the-dump 2020-09-03 10:31:11 He later went on to say that the guys ip was on the internet
the-dump 2020-09-03 10:31:17 But I havent really bothered to screen shot it

the-dump 2020-09-03 10:54:07 Seriously tho, Alfie_V2 should become an entrupanear
the-dump 2020-09-03 10:54:16 He would make millions of those totally originally missiles

the-dump 2020-09-15 21:31:26 Eh, I think people would be like eww the aircraft is terrible because its damaged
the-dump 2020-09-15 21:31:27 Or something
the-dump 2020-09-15 21:31:36 Also the roblox community is really harsh on creations
the-dump 2020-09-15 21:31:43 Its like the best you can do is never enough for people
the-dump 2020-09-16 15:40:32 
the-dump 2020-09-16 15:41:06 Click it and then right click it

the-dump 2020-09-16 15:45:28 myes
the-dump 2020-09-16 15:45:41 Thinking of making a helicopter tbh
the-dump 2020-09-16 15:45:57 All fun trying to make aircraft but its annoying having to keep going around for another strafing run
the-dump 2020-09-16 15:46:03 Lol
the-dump 2020-09-16 15:47:46 Motorlocking I think it used to get around the size limitations
the-dump 2020-09-16 15:47:52 That comes with hard coding a game apparently
the-dump 2020-09-16 15:48:02 well
the-dump 2020-09-16 15:48:04 If you wanna do that
the-dump 2020-09-16 15:48:07 Just make a flying ball pit
the-dump 2020-09-16 15:48:08 Like someone did
the-dump 2020-09-16 15:48:12 They claimed they werent trying to cause mag
the-dump 2020-09-16 15:48:22 like how the fu- how do you think a massive flying ball pit will be lag free?
the-dump 2020-09-16 15:49:49 Honestly im a little confused where all the performance issues are coming from, I never really had to use a powerful computer to put roblox on full graphics settings
the-dump 2020-09-16 15:50:25 Think my worst computer was a GT 1030 and an intel celeron
the-dump 2020-09-16 15:50:56 I only really stated my graphics card and cpu
the-dump 2020-09-16 15:50:57 Uhh
the-dump 2020-09-16 15:51:00 Not really, it was custom built
the-dump 2020-09-16 15:51:01 l o l
the-dump 2020-09-16 15:51:07 All you need to know is:
the-dump 2020-09-16 15:51:10 That computer cannot VR in the slightest
the-dump 2020-09-16 15:51:14 The celeron is worse than the i3
the-dump 2020-09-16 15:51:17 which is not very good
the-dump 2020-09-16 15:51:20 even then
the-dump 2020-09-16 15:51:31 Yeah the celeron is older
the-dump 2020-09-16 15:51:41 Im surprised it was even included in the build
the-dump 2020-09-16 15:52:04 My current computer is VR capable today tho
the-dump 2020-09-16 15:52:13 ~~Crying with a GTX 1050 Ti~~
the-dump 2020-09-16 15:52:19 Eh if you have a GTX 1050 Ti
the-dump 2020-09-16 15:52:25 You can run VR albiet with some hiccups
the-dump 2020-09-16 15:52:31 Although there are a lot of factors anyways I think
the-dump 2020-09-16 15:53:40 uh
the-dump 2020-09-16 15:53:41 k
the-dump 2020-09-16 15:53:42 lol
