plane-crazy 2020-05-24 08:15:04 haha fighter go boom
plane-crazy 2020-05-24 08:03:35 That's how lots of thicc planes look despawned tho
plane-crazy 2020-05-24 07:59:23 Oh
plane-crazy 2020-05-24 07:58:26 Yeah I just don't bother with folds, I can't get an accurate reading of mass and lift with it
plane-crazy 2020-05-24 07:57:56 Oh
plane-crazy 2020-05-24 07:56:38 Those are wing folds right
plane-crazy 2020-05-24 07:56:10 I know the game build space is hard coded but we really need bigger plots
plane-crazy 2020-05-24 07:55:50 Oof
plane-crazy 2020-05-24 07:55:06 No wonder, that plane looks sick
plane-crazy 2020-05-02 09:08:01 Thats actually a really good train tho
plane-crazy 2020-05-02 09:07:53 lol
plane-crazy 2020-05-02 08:49:36 Someone built some strange tower that made green circles
plane-crazy 2020-05-02 08:49:31 
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 14:08:06 This guy was asking everyone if they wanna watch him hang as well
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 14:07:57 Okay, wtf?
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 14:07:56 
plane-crazy 2020-04-30 14:34:30 Lol, I tried doing that once in a server a few years back, that got me instantly banned
plane-crazy 2020-04-28 14:27:40 Leave me alone MEE6, you sent me so many messages now
plane-crazy 2020-04-28 14:22:11 Oh right
plane-crazy 2020-04-28 14:22:04 Is the colours on that flag world war 2 tho
plane-crazy 2020-04-28 14:21:52 Oh apparently you cant even say that
plane-crazy 2020-04-28 14:21:43 WOrld war 2 not 1
plane-crazy 2020-04-28 14:06:48 I hope so though loads and loads of people joined only for the egg
plane-crazy 2020-04-28 14:06:08 I thought this egg hunt to attract a massive amount of people wouldnt of been a very great idea
plane-crazy 2020-04-28 14:05:52 Jesus
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 11:17:21 Oh
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 11:16:02 Hey, does anyone know the short cut to get the GUI back, it randomly disappeared in flight
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 08:42:35 eXoKay lost the right to talk about ships due to their inability to give ships the correct gender: Female or female
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 08:41:48 But I agree
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 08:41:45 The grain isnt tho
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 08:41:20 Just kill it and it should fix it
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 08:41:11 Check task manager, if your actually hearing it, you will have a task called roblox still running in the background processes section
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 08:39:12 I will buy it
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 08:38:06 w o w
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 08:37:43 Your on a roblox server what the hell did you expect?
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 08:36:44 ...
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 08:36:02 So technically its a roblox game
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 08:35:58 Plane Crazy is created with the roblox studio although its a game engine, you cant really export it
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 08:34:48 Plane Crazy should of been its own game and not on roblox and this conversation is proof.
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 08:34:11 No comment
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 17:45:13 Or let them starve and then watch as revolution happens
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 17:45:01 Either end jobs all together and give payments to citizens or whatever so they dont have to work
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 17:44:44 And after that, governments have 2 choices
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 17:44:26 k I was reading and im just gonna point out, when AI takes over our jobs, they have no dead spots they cannot take over, they will take over E V E R Y T H I N G
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 12:47:37 no shit
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 10:19:24 You dont really have a right to say that someones a noob if your making stuff like that
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 10:19:10 Lmao yeah
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 10:14:23 <@!463630970864533515>
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 10:14:20 You were saying?
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 10:14:19 
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 09:59:05 Oh wow
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 09:57:01 Imagine making a spawn killing car and calling someone a noob
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 09:53:56 You sure about that?
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 09:53:43 N o o b
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 09:53:39 
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 09:52:08 Anyways, I built a thing again
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 09:52:04 
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 09:51:59 That happens way too often
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 09:51:54 Omg lol
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 19:58:47 Lol
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 19:58:12 Tho I just realised im gonna need to adjust the fuselage a bit
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 19:57:56 Yeah, I make heavy use of these, I will take a look
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 19:56:39 Motor 2 wont work for this purpose
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 19:56:34 You mean motor 1
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 19:56:30 Yeah
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 19:56:14 k
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 19:56:13 Hmm
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 19:55:50 Starting construction...
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 19:55:49 
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 19:50:50 Hmm I think its easier to use the blueprint
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 19:50:40 go*
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 19:50:32 k I will have a god
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 19:48:18 Thats why I dont upload
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 19:48:06 Yeah
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 19:47:17 So I given up
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 19:47:15 But I cannot upload to it without a fuck ton of downvotes
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 19:47:09 Thats why I consider this server to have a relatively toxic environment, I dont consider all people toxic on here in fact most people here are fine
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 19:46:49 I found that out the hard way
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 19:46:47 Yeah
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 19:46:22 Lol no shit
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 19:46:07 Roblox or Plane Crazy?
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 19:45:26 In fact I can say that for quite a few games
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 19:45:16 This game is amazing but it probably shouldnt be a roblox game due to its community
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 19:44:54 Roblox is just killing my self confidence
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 19:44:46 I put this up somewhere it got nothing but downvotes
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 19:44:39 Seriously tho
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 19:44:26 Im the guy who likes this aircraft I made
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 19:44:22 Remember
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 19:44:21 If you think you or anything is stupid
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 19:44:21 
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 19:44:18 Like seriously
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 19:44:14 Okay boomer
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 19:43:47 Im stupid
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 19:40:08 He/she means horizontal
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 19:40:01 *Roll* stabilisation
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 19:36:54 They got a winning formula as it is why bother?
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 19:36:49 Meh I wouldnt count on them rewriting the game
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 19:36:43 Also yeah pistons do have arthritis
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 19:36:28 This shit should definitely be including
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 19:36:20 Sadly but if the game ever gets a rewrite
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 19:36:03 At least missiles do
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 19:36:01 Rockets propel way faster than most aircraft
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 19:35:53 Yeah, they are pretty bad tbh
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 19:35:32 Yeah but I think there would be a bit of fun in building and revising a self piloting missile
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 19:34:34 And I dont mean rockets, they are kinda cheap
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 19:34:24 Nah, they dont really cut it, you got to control them yourself
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 19:34:17 We are talkinga bout if there were
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 19:34:13 Yeah of course they aint
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 19:34:08 You could pick up certain types of aircraft
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 19:33:59 Hell if different frequencies are possible with radar
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 19:33:47 You could make an RwR system
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 19:33:43 And to go a bit wild, if they make sensors and *basic* computers possible
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 19:33:29 Yeah
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 19:33:20 Man they totally should
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 19:32:53 They just go for the nearest block in their area
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 19:32:44 And rockets dont use IR or Radar
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 19:32:39 Theres no radar mechanics or anything
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 19:32:33 But you are not actually stealthy
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 19:32:29 I agree with that
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 19:32:28 And all
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 19:32:26 They look cool
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 19:32:22 I dont really see the point of building stealth aircraft in this game
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 19:25:04 Yeah I wouldnt advise that either
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 19:23:42 >:)
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 19:23:41 Lol if you want a death warrant, try pinging him rn
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 19:23:32 But I believe its whats going on
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 19:23:25 I am not saying thats how wings work, you would have to ask the 2 developers
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 19:23:02 Thats my current theory on the games physics
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 19:22:58 In this game, wings simply give velocity upwards on the center of lift depending on  their speed
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 19:22:40 In real life yeah
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 19:21:53 But holy damn the hard coded build size limits make me wanna weep
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 19:21:45 To be fair though, its the best games for building an aircraft
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 19:21:14 Yeah this game aint that realistic lol
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 19:20:59 Wings are pretty abstract in this game, they dont actually need air below and above it to properly operate
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 19:20:39 If you want my guess its probably by control panels hidden inside the flying wing
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 19:19:13 What the flip is going on?
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 19:19:09 I saw a plane with signs that has decals on
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 19:18:59 Right I am completely confusion right now
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 15:46:20 Find some areas to hide some super rockets in
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 15:46:13 If your plane is too slow
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 15:45:57 I think its just weight that really affects it
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 15:45:51 Idk about how drag works
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 14:53:05 He's feeling the plane
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 14:52:22 It means we're fucked
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 14:48:06 Hurry before they make a spawn killing turret
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 14:47:51 Its the easter egg air force
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 14:47:47 Oh no
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 11:34:22 But its nice to add a *TOUCH* of reflectance
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 11:34:12 We have glass
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 11:34:08 Honestly Plane Crazy needs a way to adjust reflectancy and transparency on stuff
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 11:33:50 I forgot how beautiful the reflections are
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 11:32:35 for*
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 11:32:32 How would you even get the build imported from RBXL studio?
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 11:32:10 Hold on
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 11:32:09 Wait
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 11:32:02 It looks very off sadly
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 11:31:40 n*
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 11:31:38 If your gonna edit it, at least make it blend it
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 11:31:30 omg lol
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 15:07:10 lol
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 14:58:10 I would add trapdoors to it to act as arresting hooks
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 14:47:19 Thats sick
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 14:47:17 Wait VIP servers have gravity sliders?
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 14:46:55 Am I missing something here?
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 14:46:48 Also what  the heck, gravity slider?
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 14:46:43 Damn
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 12:08:51 Its been needing an upgrade for awhile anyways
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 12:08:49 Gonna redo the  wings and change the engine placement on this plane
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 12:01:40 Its so much fun destroying the spawn killing cars with it
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 12:01:32 I forgot about me mounting weapons on planes to that
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 12:01:24 And that
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 12:00:23 Motor 2*
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 12:00:21 I also figured out that servo is the best thing to ever happen to Motr 2
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 11:59:44 Just had to flip on inverted
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 11:59:39 That works
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 11:59:37 Oh thanks
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 11:56:14 Cant, it works the exact same as pitching no matter what I do
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 11:54:16 Its great for pitch but its hard to use for the elevons
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 11:54:05 Lol nevermind Motor controls are complete crap
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 11:48:35 Thx
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 11:48:35 Ill look into it
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 11:48:27 k
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 11:47:02 Is it possible at all?
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 11:46:57 However I do not know how to get elevons working
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 11:46:52 I am making a plane that uses Motor II's for control
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 11:46:39 Hey quick question
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 11:02:44 You know imma try that
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 11:02:34 Lol I have bombers that utilize a fuckton of missiles
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 10:52:32 You only need to do that if the house is gone
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 09:59:26 I just have motor 2s and missiles
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 09:59:17 I have a massive plane that decimates ground targets
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 09:55:08 Pistons?
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 09:54:59 Oof
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 09:54:30 That's what I'm guessing they are
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 09:54:22 Drive over it
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 09:54:17 Cutter mines are cutters on the floor
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 09:53:56 But are heavy
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 09:53:51 Materials that can withstand blasts
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 09:53:40 You know what this game needs?
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 09:53:32 Yeah, I am yet to build an A 10
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 09:52:47 But has any missile effortlessly shot down fighters?
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 09:52:32 Yeah okay, they are a great anti ground weapon
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 09:51:50 I never had a problem with them tbh
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 09:51:23 I have a plane capable of 400 without diving
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 09:51:06 The problem with them is that if they go too fast, they lose stability
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 09:50:44 Oh yeah lol
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 09:50:38 Cutter missiles?
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 09:50:30 Yeah
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 09:38:11 k
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 09:37:01 Idk, it depends on your definition of biege
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 09:36:50 236 229 211
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 09:35:41 <@!564231852391661589> Hold on
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 09:35:37 Ah
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 09:25:04 If its too pale, you can lower all values
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 09:24:58 Not much I can do
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 09:24:55 Sorry
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 09:22:49 So it could be that is the actual colour
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 09:22:41 The problem is, the colour picker does not exactly lie
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 09:22:29 I thought it was
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 09:22:28 Yeah*
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 09:22:26 yEAH
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 09:17:35 I picked the darkest bit
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 09:17:31 132 100 77?
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 09:17:07 Hold on <@!564231852391661589>
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 09:17:02 They have to actually try then
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 09:16:59 Stops new players coming just for the egg then leaving
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 09:16:49 Yeah pretty much
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 09:16:31 Last time I checked, the tutorial gave you a plane to build
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 09:16:19 Then they were like "We already have that"
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 09:16:09 So you still know how to but you are not provided a cheat plane
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 09:16:00 But without you building a plane
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 09:15:56 I had an idea of a tutorial that is like the current one
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 09:15:47 Then never comes back
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 09:15:45 That only comes to get the egg
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 09:15:38 I mean like the new players who never played before
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 09:15:28 Im just using the colour picker
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 09:15:24 Hmmm idk what to say
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 09:15:18 You know how people only join for the egg
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 09:14:43 and then they were like "cool, we dont care"
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 09:14:34 I tried to explain something and the roblox community just tried riling me up
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 09:14:14 Welp im about to head off
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 09:14:10 Yeah
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 09:13:50 to*
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 09:13:49 You have a point if they plan too
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 09:13:00 But I can tell it would take a long time
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 09:12:54 I cannot pretend I know how the games scripts work
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 09:12:49 But they listed it for the same reason they wont do co op build
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 09:12:36 Your right it probably would
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 09:12:27 Try 239 187 147
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 09:11:25 Yeah okay
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 09:11:23 Hmm
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 09:10:09 Btw, the wood seems to gradient a bit so tell me if you dont like it
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 09:10:00 R G B
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 09:09:58 Try that
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 09:09:57 239 199 164
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 09:08:33 Did you want the colour of the wood?
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 09:08:28 Right
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 09:08:27 <@!564231852391661589> Good news, it does
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 09:07:04 I'll see if Krita gives you the information
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 09:06:56 Idk
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 09:06:55 Then input that
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 09:06:48 Your best bet would be to get a colour picker that can give you an RGB colour
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 09:04:17 Lol
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 09:04:15 Its not easy to redo all the code
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 09:04:08 Why dont you throw away your computer and rebuild it from scratch
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 08:55:43 Yeah I dont really wanna build that lol
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 08:47:43 Lmao
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 08:43:38 Whats the purpose of this vehicle?
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 08:43:35 
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 08:40:06 But is way too big
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 08:40:04 It flies like one
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 08:40:03 Dont talk to me about oversizing planes, that was meant to be a fighter jet
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 08:39:59 
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 08:39:45 Really?
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 08:37:39 Not me, everyone can agree my planes dont look very good
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 08:32:13 A e r o d y n a m i c
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 08:31:32 Good thing Ctrl - F is a thing
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 08:31:25 Sorry, I was just skimming through the Q & A so I was confused when I got to the building sizes and it said for same reason as whitelisty
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 08:30:46 Yeah, someday in the far future they should rebuild the building system
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 08:30:16 They are hard coded
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 08:30:14 Nevermind
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 08:29:40 Right, I got a question, why is it physically impossible to increase the sizes of the plot?
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 08:28:56 Instead, manually enter their full username into the join friend option at the bottom of the menu
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 08:28:44 Click on PVP or if your friends already in a PVP server
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 08:28:38 PVP
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 08:28:38 Non PVP
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 08:28:36 You get 2 modes
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 08:28:31 Click gamemodes
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 08:28:26 <@!428526271664750602> To enable PVP
plane-crazy 2020-04-07 21:04:40 Thanks a lot
plane-crazy 2020-04-07 21:04:36 Yeah that fixed it right up.
plane-crazy 2020-04-07 21:04:35 
plane-crazy 2020-04-07 21:03:02 I knew I was missing something!
plane-crazy 2020-04-07 21:02:56 OMFG THANK YOU!
plane-crazy 2020-04-07 21:02:22 Thats happened
plane-crazy 2020-04-07 21:02:19 
plane-crazy 2020-04-07 21:02:09 k slight problem
plane-crazy 2020-04-07 20:58:57 I wish I was not that crap at building
plane-crazy 2020-04-07 20:58:55 
plane-crazy 2020-04-07 20:16:03 Oh lol
plane-crazy 2020-04-07 20:15:57 Wait it has to be dead on doesen't it?
plane-crazy 2020-04-07 20:12:30 Anything I can do to remedy it?
plane-crazy 2020-04-07 20:12:27 Hi, I have a problem. Im currently trying to build a helicopter however im getting an issue with oscillations back and forth. My helicopter lifts off the ground slowly but then it begins rocking which then quickly turns into violent rocking and then it crashes
plane-crazy 2020-04-07 16:30:16 For 30 minutes now
plane-crazy 2020-04-07 16:30:14 No matter what
plane-crazy 2020-04-07 16:30:12 Yeah but the problem is you get this warning every single time you join
plane-crazy 2020-04-07 16:29:32 Its not that hard to update a game
plane-crazy 2020-04-07 16:29:23 Theres literally no reason to have scripts for these, just shut down all instances
plane-crazy 2020-04-07 16:29:10 Or tells me its about to update
plane-crazy 2020-04-07 16:29:08 Every server I go on kicks me off
plane-crazy 2020-04-07 16:29:03 No I cant
plane-crazy 2020-04-07 16:28:52 Its not really necessery imo
plane-crazy 2020-04-07 16:28:47 I blame whoever made this updating system
plane-crazy 2020-04-07 16:28:20 So the PVP servers are gonna be down the whole day
plane-crazy 2020-04-07 16:28:15 Oh wow
plane-crazy 2020-04-07 16:27:55 It keeps fucking updating, the scripts must be broken or something
plane-crazy 2020-04-07 16:27:41 OMG YEAH
plane-crazy 2020-04-07 16:27:40 Those brake lights reminds me of 2000 brake lights
plane-crazy 2020-04-07 16:27:08 I am playing on roblox
plane-crazy 2020-04-07 16:27:06 I suppose
plane-crazy 2020-04-07 16:26:45 Yeah I noticed that everything I make here seems to make people hate my stuff more than on other servers
plane-crazy 2020-04-07 16:26:06 I guess im that fucking crap at building
plane-crazy 2020-04-07 16:25:52 I am never uploading my planes to this server again
plane-crazy 2020-04-07 16:25:35 Oh wow
plane-crazy 2020-04-07 16:25:26 Though I used it for a very long time and still use it today because it gives me the best performance in PVP
plane-crazy 2020-04-07 16:25:01 Yeah, thats the plane that got downvoted completely
plane-crazy 2020-04-07 16:24:49 This is the best plane I have (in terms of performance)
plane-crazy 2020-04-07 16:23:40 Oh nice
plane-crazy 2020-04-07 16:22:40 And everyone downvoted it saying it was ugly and was not a fighter jet
plane-crazy 2020-04-07 16:22:32 I put it on the votes thing
plane-crazy 2020-04-07 16:22:26 I made an air superiority fighter that fills the whole plot
plane-crazy 2020-04-07 16:22:10 Ah right
plane-crazy 2020-04-07 16:21:39 I tried making one and gave up because idk how to do the intakes
plane-crazy 2020-04-07 16:21:22 Nice F-35 btw
plane-crazy 2020-04-07 16:21:19 Ooh
plane-crazy 2020-04-07 16:20:09 Its like im the only one getting this message
plane-crazy 2020-04-07 16:19:55 But I kinda wanted to do some PVP, not get kicked off a server every time I try to join one
plane-crazy 2020-04-07 16:19:40 Yeah they look nice
plane-crazy 2020-04-07 16:19:13 Just wanted to quickly vent
plane-crazy 2020-04-07 16:19:03 I have been getting this notification on every bloody server now and its been 20 freaking minutes, it does not take this long to update servers omg
plane-crazy 2020-04-07 16:19:00 
plane-crazy 2020-04-07 15:53:24 Ps Elam's plane looks sick
plane-crazy 2020-04-07 15:53:14 Idk tho, this game is plain crazy
plane-crazy 2020-04-07 15:52:50 Usually all you need to do is shutdown all server instances and wait for people to rejoin not kick them off for 20 minutes
plane-crazy 2020-04-07 15:52:10 And then I got kicked off and could not access it since
plane-crazy 2020-04-07 15:52:04 Yeah I just joined a server and I got an alert saying there has been a fix
