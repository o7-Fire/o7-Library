build plates/panels
[building][gameplay]

Build plates are like wings panels/delta wings but they act like normal blocks and have no wing characteristics like lift and drag, so we can build without ruining how your creation functions. (also i think they should be in the middle of the block like the actual wing panel and you can change the material)
help 2020-12-04 07:53:06 yea and u can also change the material

help 2021-08-17 14:34:52 The speed is Kph (Kilometers Per Hour)
And the plane crazy character runs at 40kph, so if you convert 40kph to mps (Meters Per Second). Its 11 meters
And if you run 11 blocks its takes 1 second in Plane crazy
So 1 Block = 1 Meter
help 2021-08-17 14:57:03 tru, but saying 1 meter = 1 block also proves my statement
help 2021-08-17 14:57:28 yep
