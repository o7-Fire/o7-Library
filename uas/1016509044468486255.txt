creations-chat 2022-09-18 17:11:20 Easiest solution is to make the top section/roof shorter so the glass looks higher in comparison
creations-chat 2022-09-18 21:37:58 For future use, remember that 'alot' is not a proper word. While it may be fine to use as slang, using it on an essay will deduct points- as I learned the dumb way.
creations-chat 2022-09-18 21:46:50 They sure are making a fool of themselves
How nostalgic...
creations-chat 2022-09-18 21:59:05 I could, but then their mistake would slip by. If we "could" do things, you can piss off yourself
creations-chat 2022-09-18 22:01:14 Well obviously you give one! Look how upset you are over someone else's mistake being corrected. I wasn't even rude about it. Besides, your only counterpoint is that "nobody cares." Take it easy lmao
creations-chat 2022-09-18 22:05:51 Typical expert role arrogance. Not only is "Lego game" an overused and abstract argument, you also assume my entire personality and social life based on a few messages directed at you. The grand point here is that all of your nonsense was spouted in the most incredibly fucking unoriginal and wannabe funny of ways! Your only defense is that "well this is discord roblox server so therefore anything you say is somehow meaningless and your entire life must revolve around the platform"


Point being you have no leg to stand and and you deliver your nonsense in an unfunny and quite recycled way.
creations-chat 2022-09-18 22:08:53 Now here come more unoriginal posts, stampeding to a few premade responses and images when they hear something they don't like. You think I'M the one in need of friends and social skills? It is insane how crowd minded some of you are and how you rub each other off all day long here going through the same shit.
creations-chat 2022-09-18 22:24:28 1- Lego game WAS one of your arguments and you have no evidence for "dumbass." that is an entirely subjective statement based on your shallow preteen circle jerking sessions
2- The word for that is "pretentious"  and no, i'm not trying to "be smarter than those around me." It's called applying yourself and using what you have learned to interact how you desire.
3- Probably not. Can't prove anything here as we cannot see each other's inner thoughts, but i am very confident in the fact that you are the insecure one here. 
4-Never said that

Everything you have said is absolute nonsensical discord lingo. You sound like a politician, repeating what everyone else here says and does. Because i act one way on discord does not mean i am the same way in real life. You CAN have distinct and unrelated thought processes. Seriously, the amount of stupidity you show i have never seen elsewhere. Anyone with a medium understand of english will have no trouble understanding me. You having a problem with my vocabulary shows a severe case of dumbassery itself. 

So this entire thing is stupid and i am doing listening to your bullshit. Go watch some youtube or something educational if you think i'm being pretentious for your own good
creations-chat 2022-09-18 22:27:05 https://tenor.com/view/cry-about-it-gif-24564527
You are only proving me right here. Keep posting images to nothing. It's not going to do anything meaningful.
creations-chat 2022-09-18 22:31:53 I dream of a plane crazy where each is their own and doesn't repeat each other's jokes all day. Where one doesn't reply with flat out wrong statements meant to irritate the other. In its current state, this server is bad for debate. All that happens is anything typed is met with the same tired response. You guys run in circles  with an image for a few months then find a new gif to use.

It has lost meaning here and it is actually socially encouraged to be dumber and conform.
creations-chat 2022-09-18 22:37:47 Pull yourselves out of this trance
creations-chat 2022-09-18 22:40:31 Not 30, i have a full life, and i was arguing about stupidity in the server. You obviously didn't pay attention yet are so quick to respond the same thing. Again, discord and real life are SEPERATE. we act SEPERATE in each one. You know nothing about me but what you have seen here.
creations-chat 2022-09-18 22:42:38 That is subjective judgment based on very limited personal experience. I am 15. Say what you like, that does not change reality. Another case of talking out of your ass about me when you know an incredibly small amount.

Forget it, you'll just keep doing the same unfunny shit in response. Go ahead and have the last word.
creations-chat 2022-09-18 22:46:15 I said you can have the last word but never mind. You didn't listen! I HAVE a life outside of discord. I barely ever use discord! check my message history.

Grammar is not perfect, and there is nothing wrong with using decent grammar
creations-chat 2022-09-18 22:57:20 
creations-chat 2022-09-18 22:59:31 I am not in that server. Your word and thought do not change reality.
creations-chat 2022-09-18 23:01:46 I do not regret to inform you that I have ceased caring and will no longer respond to edited screenshots and bullshit claims. Do what you like.
creations-chat 2022-09-18 23:03:58 No. that was to prove that plane crazy is the only server i am in. Later.

creations-chat 2023-06-29 17:06:42 this is what i mean look at the difference between plane crazy and elite engineering 
how do you guys still play this game or godforsaken flightpoint
creations-chat 2023-06-29 17:08:48 at least build in studio or some shit do something not limited to caveman locking systems and imprecise polygons
not to mention the horrid flight
creations-chat 2023-06-29 17:12:05 this, you can code with logic, build with vertices, mirror mode, 200 saves, actual drag and lift 

the only reason for really mentioning this is because so many of you try to be the best and most realistic but play shitty games and wallow in misery constantly because the base game just doesn't allow good creations
creations-chat 2023-06-29 17:14:13 trying to show at least some of you a light at the end of the tunnel instead of plane crazy/flightpoint/astrocraft constantly limiting you with L devs
creations-chat 2023-06-29 17:16:57 Oh sick, is that going to be 3d First person or like roblox camera
help 2023-06-29 17:17:40 both would be ideal
help 2023-06-29 17:17:54 as far as i know youd be the first
creations-chat 2023-06-29 17:21:34 The builds always, without fail, are just plain and blocky at the end no matter how creative or good they are
You CAN make that argument but consider how many plane crazy players chase the most "realism" or "accuracy" in this channel  and with their votes
creations-chat 2023-06-29 17:24:35 What is the appeal then other than simplicity? there is a huge difference in something being simple or elegant and something being flat out poorly made and limiting
creations-chat 2023-06-29 17:29:32 Someone show me the single best build plane crazy has to offer
or anything impressive really
creations-chat 2023-06-29 17:35:47 average creations there
creations-chat 2023-06-29 17:40:11 I'm not telling anybody what to do, if you want to be angry go ahead but i'm not going to argue with run of the mill hostile dumbassery like that
like i said just trying to show those who are interested that there is a better way
creations-chat 2023-06-29 17:42:19 Exactly, and that's fine i'm just here to show those who want to break past PC and FP's limits to make something actually creative
and it doesn't take that much time to make good builds when you have W tools <:thoink:657279634563399720>
creations-chat 2023-06-29 18:00:01 and <@802982088705703947> 
both of you clarify what you are trying to say here in concrete terms

and here is a another cockpit, made by  getoutdood this time and he was new at the game at the time

On top of that, 4/5 times trying to have a discussion or argument with a special type of you, resorts to you not having any good points and going to gifs and shallow "cope" type nonsense
creations-chat 2023-06-29 18:03:47 That alone is true *however* most plane crazy players ARE trying to make realistic things and are judged harshly on such standards (even those being low) 
this community is quite toxic and self righteous, as demonstrated above even when they don't have a fucking clue in the world what they're on about 

See , above <@937119057042358322>  we see you when challenged reverting standards from what you would normally say to the base concept of such games (those which aren't actually followed) and as i said the community tries to be complex but is limited
creations-chat 2023-06-29 18:07:25 Ok
While you can say that it is an "arcade sandbox"  or even a "lego kids game" that doesn't change how most treat such games and try to make realistic builds constantly
That is not what i was saying at all, i am saying that Plane Crazy and flightpoint are highly limiting to those of you who want to go past, and are objectively shitty in that specific regard
i am also stating how tedious is it to use aforemention games' tools
creations-chat 2023-06-29 18:09:47 It actually isn't OG, his game lacks corner snapping coordinates, basic changeable keybind systems, multiselect, drag select, the tools such as rotation and moving and resizing are limited to their base function and don't habe the global local and last features, the list really goes on.
creations-chat 2023-06-29 18:13:39 You are missing the point, i am saying there is a more user friendly alternative with all the features/aspects and more 
it's not any more complex or unintuitive than plane crazy/fp just has more feature, better stability, and just flat out more elegant building and functions

Funny how hostile you are about this, the truth is i don't care if you don't care if you want to stay with "simplicity" (otherwise recognized as ass tedious building) go ahead. Plenty do care and have joined in the past 
You are mistaking my arguments for "coming at you"  anyways take it fuckin easy about that
creations-chat 2023-06-29 18:17:07 Look i'm not trying to argue here do what you want i just want to spread the word on a better option for people like me who used to be limited by this shit
creations-chat 2023-06-29 18:23:15 Now you are just flat out wrong, if you don't care then go on about it i'm not talking to your type here who want jagged lanky disproportionate nonsense that has unrealistic physics

<@448677698773057547> i'm not talking to your type here, i'm talking to the ones who don't know about something they would potentially love
i am however curious on how EE is any more boring than plane crazy?
creations-chat 2023-06-29 18:25:34 It's the same idea of user generated content battling and interacting and we have enough players daily to fight and share ideas? if it is boring sounds like you sat there for 3 minutes placed a few parts and left

And massive as i said im not here for baseless tasteless meme insults 

We have fights and shit all the time in ee it's the same thing 

OG go on already if you aren't interested 🤣 🤣
creations-chat 2023-06-29 18:28:00 I will continue spreading the word on this game, it's worked ingame in plane crazy and i now have around 3 new daily players to chill with there
I really dont care if you're mad or anything about that my goal has been accomplished here, we have new players as a result
creations-chat 2023-06-29 18:30:35 I can 100% sniff out teh chatGPT in that reply, it's the same point. 

those of you seething at me having ultimately different objectives: You want simplicity and shit in the same way as minecraft

and i want realistic shit: So i'm only here to find and take with me those who don't like the simplicity but don't know about EE at all 
You know, those who weren't happy with pc but don't know about it's competitors
creations-chat 2023-06-29 18:32:57 Massive, i will say this one final time, i don't care about you guys who are content, you are not who i want to convince. I'm here for the people who were in my position two years back

Fuzzy they screaming in circles and making this needlessly hostile despite me partially agreeing with their point and saying i dont wan't to argue about that
Again OG you are just flat out misunderstanding. Take it easy
creations-chat 2023-06-29 18:36:18 there's some miserable ass people in this server goddamn lol
i will now thank god every day for going to blender for a while to get a new perspective on building things online

i am not advertising, simply telling a specific type of player in this server about a game they may like. I am not on the behalf of any entity nor being paid. This is simply word of mouth.

<@858278645760393216> you can do far more with said parts (you dont need 30 blocks in a sequence to make one angle) and we have resizing up to 100
creations-chat 2023-06-29 18:38:25 i am however a bit hostile to a specific OTHER type of player (the ones like you)

d3lete i already said i dont want to convince the ones like you, we don't need bullshit that you guys spew in ee

OG the technical rules are in my favor here
creations-chat 2023-06-29 18:41:21 Canon if you don't like it block me. for the probably 8th time 
**i'm not talking to the players like your kind**
creations-chat 2023-06-29 18:43:43 Yeah that's what i been saying dog they making this personal and shit like i hate them or something
i dont want drama or arguements so thanks for understanding that. The only reason i kept on is to disprove the objective false statements
creations-chat 2023-06-29 22:39:52 Using global vector thrust at the right densities yes
creations-chat 2023-06-29 22:43:43 weight x200 applied globally in the Y axis, (gravity is 200SPS^2 in EE)
creations-chat 2023-06-29 23:01:52 Fleet just go on not trying to hear all your dumbassery
creations-chat 2023-06-29 23:07:40 what do you need 0g for though
creations-chat 2023-06-29 23:10:00 OK the best (most reliable) to control that is fixed thrust on key locations with leverage, connected an addition circuit sine wave adder. Basically when a key is held it counts at whatever increment and speed you want to a value, then goes back down when the key is released

OR power servos with thrust really simple
creations-chat 2023-06-29 23:22:49 the creator of the game himself loves making spaceships so you're good in that regard
gonna get a clip of one that works well 
ok this is some kind of space station someone made for the space 
zone
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/938120944977850448/1115348375034937405/Thrusters.mp4
But i mean gravity and wing part effectiveness decrease with height so you could just fly it to space too
creations-chat 2023-06-29 23:24:51 I'm talking to this dude quar, going to go to dms with it actually forgot for a moment how nitpicky assholes PCC is
Damn it really bothers you guys that bad to see that how unhappy do you have to be in life

Fuckin block me or something
creations-chat 2023-06-29 23:26:59 Now you're just throwing around baseless insults hoping one sticks, at least be original or something or even a little bit entertaining
creations-chat 2023-06-29 23:29:44 I came to call my people man, not you guys but the ones like quar who don't like PC or its members
You're all kind of exaggerating the same 3 points as if they haven't already been negated hours previously
creations-chat 2023-06-29 23:32:33 It's like talking to a goddamn brick wall: i said just now once more: 
*i dont wan't players like you to join me. Fuck you guys*
i'm here for players like the one i was talking to

And no fleet you guys come up with stretch after stretch and then twist and leap to sideways upsidefuck conclusions then subsequently post ironic gifs and proclaim victory
creations-chat 2023-06-29 23:35:37 that's the stretchest point this far
not only am i not involved in any way with development, not only do i not want players like you and desired to interact with me, not only am i tired of re explaining the same things 4 times before you find a way to fuck its core meaning entirely, the builds here are objectively trash in most manners so there really isn't much you can say

(later)

Now he's flat out lying
creations-chat 2023-06-29 23:38:31 I'm not advertising, so nothing you have said so far anyways has even a sprinkling of truth. now you really have no legs to stand on. Fucking stumps to wallow in your misery with
remember that advertising is  a job
creations-chat 2023-06-29 23:41:02 A small part of me likes doing this
but at the same time one of you say something upsidefucking stretched and the rest cling to it until i disprove it which you then pull at another strand and repeat
after about 10 strands you go back to the first

see like desired oversimplifying and intentionally twisting words unti they're flat out wrong (notice the overran cavemen speak meme here)
creations-chat 2023-06-29 23:43:05 advertising is a business affair how fucking stupid 🤣 🤣 🤣  
Do you know what a business entails??

Desired because 4 of you make up wacky shit at once and i pick the dumbest first
I mean you're all just wrong anyways about anything objective here so it really doesn't matter  whether i give reasoning or not
creations-chat 2023-06-29 23:45:18 I get a little bit of a chance to see how far the PCC has devolved, 
as i said it's a small fun to have dumbass internet arguments once in a blue moon
i have time today, off work early
and some players will join EE that want the features

Fleet go read above messages already addressed those points a few times hours ago
creations-chat 2023-06-29 23:47:32 I do like arguing with dumbass deluded preteens who think their claymotion ass build is the best force of god in the game (it has a 10 stud turning radius !!!)
I also used to be one of you too a long time ago so it's like a look into a former self
creations-chat 2023-06-29 23:49:53 There's really nothing that you can say OTHER than that you want inferior quality games because it's more a challenge to do the most basic shit  🤷‍♂️ 

Yes i do wallow in the mud with you mf every now and then, for some unknown force drives it
creations-chat 2023-06-29 23:51:55 fucking reddit circlejerk finger in ass type foolishness in this server you guys got going still even after this time
and you think "we want simplicity" when you downvote the poor new player's shit in creations because it wasn't detailed enough...
creations-chat 2023-06-29 23:54:02 Take a look at the hall of fame for example point me to a SINGLE good build  

as for you new people jumping in this little exchange you don't have any understanding of all the previous dialogue so your word is nothing

No links to game fleet, cant do that
creations-chat 2023-06-29 23:56:04 Oh i've had many massive points but they're so prideful and insecure about their rocky underdetailed foolishness they got hostile instantly 
https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/504436696021204992/1124039997872423073 here fleet
creations-chat 2023-06-30 00:00:16 It's just as limited as the rest, blocky texturing, bland colors,  disproportionate body and inherently uncurvy polygonal structure
not to mention how primitve the movement mechanincs in PC are how everything is pretty much limited to direct keybinds and basic constraints
On top of of that incredibly inefficient block usage to even get an acceptable shape which by then it causes physics delay and has no room for good mechanics.

My point stands that even the best builds here just flat out suck from the outside perspective and when compared to competitors

YOU GUYS DONT EVEN HAVE LOGIC STILL!!!!
creations-chat 2023-06-30 00:02:55 We are viewing this from different points 
think about hwo you are forced to choose between LOOKS and FUNCTION in every aspect 
even for a simple game making the most fundemental of ANYTHING is  a whole affair that will amount to a rat's ass in the end
creations-chat 2023-06-30 00:04:59 you abosulute.. FUCKING LOGIC GATES GOD ABOVE THAT IS just golden. Those and numerical/vector functions allow automation and more or less coding builds with few parts (less than 40 for fully animated walk cycles!!) in an elegant manner
creations-chat 2023-06-30 00:07:06 you assume it doesn't take effort to make something impressive. It does, there just isn't roadblocks in every single aspect of the build as well as no caveman grid lock system
For example you have to manually construct the vertices and wireframs, connect those with triangles, balance the density, tune all your functions like the swashplate and automate things like stabilization with little math loops
creations-chat 2023-06-30 00:09:17 also learning logic and vector gives a super solid understanding of coding mindset/lua and before you know it you understand code by pure chance of the problem solving it took to numerically code your EE things
where in things like motorlock you're just sticking to the franchise and its abstract quirks to do anything
creations-chat 2023-06-30 00:11:54 let me guess, FP? Even that game with unlocked grid lacks the vital aspects it takes to efficiently get things done in fact i have a month old notepad with what FP lacks to EE

here's that just the vitals: 
No adjustable coefficient of drag in ANY AXIS
no key to switch between resize moving and rotation 
no LOCAL last and global submodes on those tool
increments cannot  be adjusted and are limited to .01 
there is no multi-select
the building process is quite tedious as there are hardly KEYS for anything as well as the simple fact that keybinds cannot be changed at all
settings from last session dont carry over
tiny tiny build area
the logic aspect is almost nonexistent and primitive at best
no drag select as an extension of no multiselect 
lacking saves 
no undo or redo function it appears
traingle and beam tool are particurly laborsome in favor of corner snapping and rotation pivots
no tool for switching collisions 
i have yet to find texturing tools for decal IDs
actually they just got mirror
creations-chat 2023-06-30 00:13:56 Well we've said what we find important so if any of you want to sling insults around more you have all the previous talks to prove yourself wrong with 
like what appears to be a noob who just jumped in with no core understanding of the things discussed
