help 2021-05-31 19:50:00 For a VTOL, should the entire wing rotate, or just the engines to make it the most effective?

creations-chat 2021-06-01 02:48:09 People also hate my learjet ;-;
creations-chat 2021-06-03 23:47:23 people like it because it was made in the *first version* of plane crazy
creations-chat 2021-06-03 23:56:35 yes
creations-chat 2021-06-04 01:01:20 I tried making a fast build *without* glitches. I think it caps at 650
creations-chat 2021-06-04 01:04:23 I used motor lock, and heard of conveyor drives. But never hover drives. I think I am just stupid
creations-chat 2021-06-04 01:06:47 Is this a hover drive? It does work to make it go fast after trying
creations-chat 2021-06-04 01:14:17 Wow it works really well
creations-chat 2021-06-04 01:21:28 I just found my favorite way of propulsion
creations-chat 2021-06-04 02:16:09 Fastest plane I *could* make (I didn't know the different acceleration drives at the time)
creations-chat 2021-06-04 20:02:28 If you want to be respected or liked, then I would recommend trying *not* to criticize other people's opinion on your build
creations-chat 2021-06-04 20:06:18 I understand that, and I also understand that this is not my problem. But you should not worry about what others think about your build. Instead, take what they say, and use it to improve your build. You will also get the bonus of proving them wrong.
creations-chat 2021-06-04 20:08:39 He says what looks bad not because of performance. He wants you to keep the performance, but improve the design.
creations-chat 2021-06-06 18:07:59 I agree if Mich, you should make it have two connectors. It makes it look more sturdy
creations-chat 2021-06-06 18:10:38 cool

creations-chat 2021-06-23 16:46:53 We want you to *improve*. We are trying to give you tips, but you shut us out saying that your build is perfect. If you didn't want to listen to feedback, then don't post your creation.
creations-chat 2021-06-23 16:50:01 Again you shut me out, you need to actually listen to our feedback instead of denying everything. You need to stop complaining about our feedback and listen to it.
creations-chat 2021-06-23 16:53:57 The tips are *optional*. You criticize our tips without even considering using them for any other build you may work on.

creations-chat 2021-06-24 23:02:46 Well people in plane crazy only upvote if the creation looks decent. An exception is when people make revolutionary inventions. (or ducks)
creations-chat 2021-06-24 23:07:52 You need to chill out. You put your creation on <#384025409945337856> expecting feedback. Now you are refusing to listen to feedback and using insults to settle an irrelevant argument.
creations-chat 2021-06-24 23:16:35 Yes but it does not serve it's real life purpose. In real life, the blades tilt to turn, not the tail rotor
