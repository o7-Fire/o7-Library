The Tale of pencilsharpener99 (712085126418399282)

creations-chat 2023-01-02 23:30:53 A suggestion, if you want to slim down the prop a little bit, I'd suggest using control surfaces. It'd give the appearance of a (slightly) skinner prop and gives one the ability to paint leading edge wear if necessary.
