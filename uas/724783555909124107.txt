creations-chat 2020-09-24 16:26:36 and im just gonna infinitely do that
creations-chat 2020-10-01 17:05:10 i'm having an issue, whenever i put motor 2's on my car they start spazing, but only with suspension. is there some way i can still use the suspension and the motor 2?
creations-chat 2020-10-01 17:05:34 that's a bruh moment
creations-chat 2020-10-01 17:05:50 yeah
creations-chat 2020-10-01 17:06:45 then what exactly do i use? because tank steering doesn't look right on a car. i dont really build much cars but its just quite annoying because i can't seem to get around it.
creations-chat 2020-10-01 17:07:32 it just looks strange when steering, it doesn't look natural
creations-chat 2020-10-01 17:08:03 its just a chassis for now
creations-chat 2020-10-01 17:08:22 
creations-chat 2020-10-01 17:08:58 thats what i've been doing, but i changed the motor to motor 1 on reset thinking that might help
creations-chat 2020-10-01 17:09:25 yeah, dont really build cars. just cancer pvp boats
creations-chat 2020-10-01 17:10:15 so uh i use rockets to steer?
creations-chat 2020-10-01 17:10:41 confusion
creations-chat 2020-10-01 17:12:08 now ya see, that's a bit complicated with no explanation
creations-chat 2020-10-01 17:12:47 okay, so you use 2 motors?
creations-chat 2020-10-01 17:13:41 bruh ima go make my own hol up

creations-chat 2020-11-14 20:17:06 <@!734608228192616572>  i unsure how to get rid of the motors on the wings, due to the way it was made, however i can try remove the propellers on the wings and get the vtol to work without them, thanks for the critism .

creations-chat 2020-11-18 17:52:19 also the sides had holes in them thats why theres a giant block above the middle. im terrible at detail..utter trash at it
creations-chat 2020-11-18 17:54:18 it was a glitch, but was then made a "feature" because it had tons of potential
creations-chat 2020-11-18 17:58:03 <@!478872476374401024>  that's what i used to be like, but once you start using it alot, it becomes super easy. no lol

creations-chat 2021-03-01 14:21:06 <@!781206492187590656>  bruh why do you care so much? seriously im just putting a post up, you're not a moderator go find something else to do man jeez
creations-chat 2021-03-01 14:24:00 yo im perfectly relaxed, but tongs just bein real rude about stuff man. and yeah he seems to be a furry, really into that community too.
creations-chat 2021-03-01 14:26:02 <@!315262125113081856>  maybe rude wasn't the right word, i mean he was being annoying, and really licking the servers rules a bit much.
creations-chat 2021-03-01 18:37:33 <@!690967945165275216> thank you very much, i lost a billion braincells locking it...
creations-chat 2021-03-01 18:40:44 <@!387195148741771275>  that's to show the locks, i often show my builds despawned because i feel it's more appropriate to show what it actually took and also i just like seeing other peoples locks too so it's nice to show them mine i guess
creations-chat 2021-03-01 18:43:11 yeah sorry man dunno, didn't really think about it
