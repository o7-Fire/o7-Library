Its for my core sim i guess
creations-chat 2023-07-16 21:01:15 it is my core simulator and these are the 2 building on the roof, i just finished them and have yet to figure out what to use them for
creations-chat 2023-07-16 21:03:18 i will send an image of the storage rooms finished today or tomorrow ðŸ™‚

creations-chat 2023-07-16 21:46:45 rare footage of a confused moderator tho, im boutta earn some cheddar
creations-chat 2023-07-16 21:49:19 yeah.. BUT it is confirmed that it is in development
creations-chat 2023-07-16 21:51:24 does this look like a proper storage or does anyone have tips for more?
creations-chat 2023-07-16 21:53:26 whats wrong with the image, is that a pic of u fuzzy?
creations-chat 2023-07-16 21:57:22 well unless whoever is the rightful owner of that picture says that it is ok to post that to an entire community server, i get why fuzzy isnt letting it slide for multiple reasons including that

fuzzy is also asking you to refrain so it would be great if you could listen
creations-chat 2023-07-16 22:00:33 The argument is about FleetOfRetribution posting a face mirrored picture of FuzzytheWookie_007's boyfriend in here and fuzzy is asking him politely to refrain in wich fleet refuses, anyways i gotta go to bed, see ya tomorrow
creations-chat 2023-07-17 11:10:39 Yesterday i asked in this chat what to use these building for,  someone answered with Storage, does this look good?
creations-chat 2023-07-17 11:15:54 it looks like an air and liquid filtering pipe room doesent it

creations-chat 2023-07-17 11:39:34 this is a fresh room in my core simulation and i dont have any ideas myself for it, what should i use it for?

i kinda wanna see if i can make a freezer, but if anyone else has ideas, i'd be happy to see what i can do
creations-chat 2023-07-17 11:50:07 rod storage?

**Edit: **any other ideas?
bot-central 2023-07-17 12:00:13 ?shelp
creations-chat 2023-07-17 12:04:52 does anyone have any other ideas apart from any kind of storage?
creations-chat 2023-07-17 12:07:14 its on the 2nd floor, so thats gonna be a bit difficult, got any other ideas apart from a garage?
creations-chat 2023-07-17 12:10:53 i still dont know what to use it for.

Its on the 2nd floor, empty, needs ideas, i dont have any ideas that will work, its in a core facillity, and im still stuck on what to do with it
creations-chat 2023-07-17 12:14:20 problem with most ideas is that i dont have a proper plan yet for any of them and having other ideas would make it a bit easier, so im just questioning around on what to do.

and btw the guy in between us is just the average discord user
creations-chat 2023-07-17 12:16:57 any other ideas?
creations-chat 2023-07-17 12:19:39 not sure if it'll fit the theme, but i'll try anyways, if you got any other ideas on mind, just reply with them, ill be building an office i guess

help 2023-07-17 20:50:07 or at least optionable
creations-chat 2023-07-17 20:50:42 trust me, there is no all good in any community.

i've gotten lots of hate here but that didnt stop me from working
creations-chat 2023-07-17 20:53:37 it didnt stop me from posting a nearly 10k block build and hoping for the best
creations-chat 2023-07-17 20:56:41 you shouldnt let a bad community tell you what to do.

thats the worst thing you can do at this point.

You should just keep working on your creations and at some point, you may take your time and you may have a good time.

If you want to talk to someone who has had massive hate here, you can dm me
creations-chat 2023-07-17 20:59:56 peapole downvote stuff because they are so jealous that they go for trying to make the authors quit their stuff

its a, HORRIBLE community
creations-chat 2023-07-17 21:05:11 with all honesty, these communities are full ass and most of the assholes you find here are just stupidly jealous idiots who think that downvoting and hating on peapole that did nothing will depress them into suicide, it dont matter if you are good or bad, you will get hate because peapole are either jealous or asbolute no lifers.

but what you shouldnt do is let them win, thats a big mistake, dont let their shit get to you and keep going, build, expand and improve, thats the best i can give.
creations-chat 2023-07-17 21:14:40 i dont remember much of what kinda tips i asked <:clueless:942802644043464734>
