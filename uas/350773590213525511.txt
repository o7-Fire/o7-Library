creations-chat 2019-05-08 04:13:08 thxs
creations-chat 2019-05-08 04:17:13 and with the last ounce of will in my body i give you it color coded so you can copy it and pass it as your own,
Red is the engine part that moves the entire thing
Yellow is what i call first gear it moves when the engine is on
Green is second gear the 3 pistons are used for moving the counter shaft and output shaft into position
Blue is for third gear the one piston is used for connecting the input and output shaft together
Grey is nothing really important 
Black is where you can attatch it to the main body of your vehicle
(also forgot to add this put on the far left that motor/block thing is your output)
creations-chat 2019-05-08 04:18:03 the bit colored pink is output, also requesting rank inventor pls

creations-chat 2019-06-03 06:36:29 i probably put this off for to long but i finnaly did it i made a working car using my gear box design
creations-chat 2019-06-03 06:36:55 a little run down of how it works
creations-chat 2019-06-03 06:37:43 these rockets were once a motor but it was to weak and couldnt push the wheels so i used rockets instead, these act as the "engine" powering the input shaft
creations-chat 2019-06-03 06:39:23 Moving across the input shaft the red gears work to use gears one and two while the yellow and blue use three and four, by moving them in different directions i can order them into making the correct gear combinations for the different speeds, 1 slow, 2 kinda slow, 3 moderate speed, 4 jesus calm down and take the wheel
creations-chat 2019-06-03 06:41:02 the output shaft is shown here (top rod) aswell as well as the counter shaft (below rod) counter shaft connects the input and output shafts for different speeds, the orange gear also is used in first gear
creations-chat 2019-06-03 06:42:15 here is it all together basically how it works in a summary is the input shaft stays at one continues speed, the counter shaft allows the gears to be moved back in forth to create new combinations, the combinations allow the output shaft to spin at different speeds and move the car
creations-chat 2019-06-03 06:42:27 also the most advanced steering ever right here

bug-reports 2019-10-15 05:12:48 That's probably why my tiger tank tuned into an interdimentional traveler, it uses motor 2 mouse controls for the turret.
bug-reports 2019-10-15 07:22:12 Max torque one speed for me
bug-reports 2019-10-15 07:22:23 I think it's just the mouse control pissing itself

bug-reports 2019-10-21 07:04:54 Motor 2 servo is oofed and has no torque or speed
bug-reports 2019-10-21 07:05:32 And motor 2 mouse control just summons kithulo and banishes you to the 7th dimension
bug-reports 2019-10-21 14:14:05 To put it into perspective currently my stukas cockpit refuses to close and the wings are so slow I crash into the ground after a dive cause I cant pull up, my tiger tank has turned to summoning cthulu and the turret has turned into a helicopter, my HMS Exeter has decided that her guns and hull have better things to do and become increasingly more concerned about reaching the 8th dimension, my millennium falcon refuses to bend its front down and will constantly do loops now and can you guess what they all use together? That a right kids motor 2
bug-reports 2019-10-21 14:32:49 Gg
bug-reports 2019-10-21 14:33:28 At least one good thing we pulled out of this is that we found new ways to tap into the speed force

bot-central 2020-09-25 04:14:47 -mapsuggest Use the maps from the two competitions that were held as candidates for new maps so we dont have an overflow of new submissions, the ones for the two contests already had guidelines to follow and I bet some people still have their maps around this would make the selection smaller and easier to manage aswell as being able to implement the map sooner since its already complete.
