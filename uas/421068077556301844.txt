creations-chat 2022-03-20 22:06:07 on that second harrier its minor details but its still relatively ok seems confusing as to why it was shit on with 80 dislikes
creations-chat 2022-03-20 22:09:07 I can agree that the community can really be a pain in the ass and give little to no help with something or just word it heavily that brings someone down
creations-chat 2022-03-20 22:13:42 it was very few times that i genuinely got the help and support i needed with few builds. other times it was just mostly insults without reasoning to help further just "its shit"
creations-chat 2022-03-20 22:16:20 tbh i only used help once and that was when something wasnt working right but you are correct because i actually got help from people who cared
creations-chat 2022-03-20 22:18:58 this is no longer the creations feedback it became creations chat
