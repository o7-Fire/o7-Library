creations-chat 2020-06-22 18:39:00 I made a Airbus A320 Neo and someone told me the windows were too high, but I spaced it accordingly to the diagram and adjusted for the belowdeck baggage area
creations-chat 2020-06-22 18:40:23 Thoughts? I thought the windows were fine
creations-chat 2020-06-22 18:40:47 thx

creations-chat 2021-04-07 04:30:10 same reason 90s cars are better than new cars
because more simple more better
the-dump 2021-04-07 04:31:27 
creations-chat 2021-04-07 04:32:44 personal opinion ig
imo theyâ€™re easier to work on and the simple interiors force you to focus on driving and not mess with modern features

also a good majority of 90s Japanese cars are still running at over 300k miles with just simple maintence, which says something in regards to reliability
the-dump 2021-04-07 04:34:50 i deleted it lol, i sent it in the wrong server
creations-chat 2021-04-07 04:37:48 imagine they just remove the shredder all together and replace it with a new wedge in the same shape
creations-chat 2021-04-07 04:45:06 i specifically said 90s cars because more of them are reliable than any 80s car could be, a lot of them have decently nice interiors, and they still have modern esk safety features and simple additions like cruise control. but just IMO i prefer 90s cars to modern car

i would take a 97â€™ camry over a modern car any day
(not including modern enthusiast cars lol, just your basic sedan or coupe)

creations-chat 2021-04-07 16:43:41 
creations-chat 2021-04-07 17:42:15 like
dihedral?
yeah they should, thanks for the suggestion
ill do that
creations-chat 2021-04-07 17:50:40 i have taken your suggestion seriously, and failed in the process due to the thick wings
creations-chat 2021-04-07 17:52:42 i assume the problem is the motor 2 which would move the wings upward. its not a solid block, so the game tries to collid the now movable wings with the immovable half blocks.
help 2021-04-07 17:54:23 <@!551806781609869313> how would that help
help 2021-04-07 17:54:58 im using motor 2 to add dihedral
help 2021-04-07 17:56:59 but the motor locking is instant, how can i get it to move before it collids with the other half of the wing?
help 2021-04-07 17:57:32 on top of that, the way the top half of the wing is build i doubt i could add a similar angle-
help 2021-04-07 17:57:33 oooooooh
help 2021-04-07 18:01:32 can you send a ss of how you would use disconnectors in that situation? they just stick to other motors and break the locking tower

help 2021-04-10 17:21:16 does anyone know if theres a block that will only attach on two ends, nothing else will attach?
help 2021-04-10 17:21:24 like a half-slab in the middle of a block
help 2021-04-10 17:23:16 nope. im using it as an alternative to a cylinder or wing in a motor lock, and it cant attach to anything on the sides of the tower
help 2021-04-10 17:23:55 
help 2021-04-10 17:24:04 
help 2021-04-10 17:24:27 the thing is, i need to put a jet there. but it wont go down since it attaches to the cylinder
help 2021-04-10 17:24:45 and i cant make the tower higher up as ive already built half a plane up there
help 2021-04-10 17:25:14 maybe i could just put a firework launcher in the front, it looks similar
help 2021-04-10 17:28:15 
help 2021-04-10 17:28:20 
help 2021-04-10 17:28:27 i think it would look better without anyways
help 2021-04-10 17:31:55 gotcha, ill keep them
help 2021-04-10 17:32:40 yea i figured out the issue. i was just putting the jet in the wrong spot, the cylinders werent the problem
help 2021-04-10 17:32:46 thanks lol
help 2021-04-10 17:41:18 i managed to actually fit jets using some magic with wedges
help 2021-04-10 17:42:16 okay i might put that back
help 2021-04-10 17:43:15 its just that the fireworks dont move- i could color the jets the same as the fireworks to make them darker. im trying to aim for an element of realism
the-dump 2021-04-10 17:47:33 
help 2021-04-10 17:51:39 i might do something like this
help 2021-04-10 17:51:41 
help 2021-04-10 18:02:27 not really gonna be able to do something like that due to the size and rest of the plane
help 2021-04-10 18:02:40 
help 2021-04-10 18:03:01 yeah.
help 2021-04-10 18:03:03 its small.

help 2021-04-10 18:03:48 
help 2021-04-10 18:05:01 its very wonky. i used motorlocking to move the seat up by half a block so i could see in first person and get the shape correct
help 2021-04-10 18:05:04 
help 2021-04-10 18:05:18 theres not much room to work with
help 2021-04-10 18:05:26 yep
help 2021-04-10 18:05:34 and it still looks decent
help 2021-04-10 18:06:16 and i dont want to make the jets go out any farther than they already are, because then it would be inaccurate
help 2021-04-10 18:10:06 i wanted it to be small enough to land on those tiny carriers people make in public servers
help 2021-04-10 18:10:12 also a small target in pvp
help 2021-04-10 19:52:50 I dunno. Without them it looks worse.
help 2021-04-10 19:53:24 I know how the plane is
help 2021-04-10 19:53:45 I just tried both meathods, the one without the front of the jets looks considerably worse
creations-chat 2021-04-10 22:10:53 Lockheed Martin A-4. Looking for some feedback/suggestions before I post it in <#384025409945337856>
creations-chat 2021-04-10 22:16:57 Thanks for the feedback I guess.
help 2021-04-11 15:04:48 I don't know if this is just me, but the radios don't work in public servers for my whatsoever. I built my plane in a Private Server, and the audio works just fine. But the second I go into a public server they just don't. I've tried re-inputting the codes, nothing happens.
help 2021-04-11 15:37:11 Yes, the music is on.
help 2021-04-11 15:37:35 It blips a bit when I spawn it, then it just doesn't work.

creations-chat 2021-04-12 23:23:48 Thanks for the *actual* feedback. I'll try my best to fix the plane.
creations-chat 2021-04-12 23:26:35 It seems to me more like you guys complaining that I'm lazy because I have a different play-style than you. Would you rather me make a shredder? Seriously, who cares if the guns can move or not. I prefer it like that. The whole point of this game is to create what you want to create, not necessarily just a constant stream of exact replicas.
creations-chat 2021-04-12 23:30:11 Then do what Heisenberg did in regards to the body. Give me feedback and I'll try to improve the plane in those regards. But wining about how I'm using guns that aim instead of moving the whole plane (which accomplishes the same affect, seriously, who cares.) just makes you seem like an idiot.
help 2021-04-13 01:35:15 <@!333570869114830859> Let's say I wanted to make a jet fighter. Where should I start to make sure the proportions are correct?

creations-chat 2021-06-12 16:55:50 you can.. hide.. control surfaces?
theres no need to make your wings look like a cheese grater
creations-chat 2021-06-12 16:58:52 you can hide them with motor locking and thicker wings. you get the same maneuverability
OR you can make custom control surfaces that move large sections of the wing like a real plane. they almost ALWAYS look better, and you 100% of the time get better maneuverability.
creations-chat 2021-06-12 17:01:38 have you not heard of motor 2 lmfao
and if you're even decent at the game you can make wings look whole without them looking like a cheese grater, and it doesnt affect it that much.

also, never heard of gjsolo lol who tf is that
creations-chat 2021-06-12 20:45:54 Does anyone happen to have examples of a cargo ship engine room? I don't have much space at all, but I'd like to include one at least, even if its really small.
