creations-chat 2021-08-13 21:47:17 <@!443752316240265226> I have a MQ9 Reaper drone with 4 rockets and 2 cluster bombs, the thing dominates in PVP but doesn‚Äôt have a ton of detail, chances are it wouldn‚Äôt get a ton of upvotes

what

what does pvp have to do with getting upvotes
creations-chat 2021-08-13 21:49:20 you get upvotes for making a build that looks good, and functions like it was intended to, also if you want more upvotes post to creations on a Saturday or Sunday
creations-chat 2021-08-13 21:51:29 yes and there are a lot of people on that didn‚Äôt like your creations because they‚Äôre low effort such as the cube
creations-chat 2021-08-13 21:53:31 you posted a square of cutters that takes like 2 minutes to do
creations-chat 2021-08-14 03:02:52 <@!619312093962829849> I doubt that jet is custom, I think you just tried to make an FA-18 couldn‚Äôt do it and made a jet that looks like an F18

creations-chat 2021-08-15 18:58:22 <@!530585743723200512> I would say build something that takes effort, I made a V22 osprey in about an hour and i would say this is like 30% effort into the build. im not trying to be too critical but i feel like most new people now just strive to get into HOF for putting effort into half ass builds. yes thank you war crimes i agree

creations-chat 2021-08-18 20:07:23 Make the camo more fluid with the color palette, also I say make 20-30 more of them because they‚Äôre harder to counter in pvp

creations-chat 2021-08-18 20:26:19 Tail is short overall shape is too blocky
creations-chat 2021-08-18 20:28:53 Try to learn motor lock and folding, that will make your creations look a whole lot better, also you can make a 9 diameter circle for fuselages by using 8 1x2 wedge, 4 normal wedge, and 4 blocks use motor lock and half blocks to make the shape of the wings less thin


Learn folding
creations-chat 2021-08-18 20:34:06 I‚Äôm surprised you learned motor lock before folding. When you learn folding you can just make bigger builds, your c17 would look a lot better if it was 2x the size, you can also add a ton more detail that way

creations-chat 2021-09-09 00:53:29 Idea was scrapped due to cost effectiveness
creations-chat 2021-09-10 00:42:34 creations are mid per usual
creations-chat 2021-09-10 00:49:44 why are you using control surfaces lol
creations-chat 2021-09-10 00:55:45 we all start somewhere jk
creations-chat 2021-09-14 14:15:46 Nice
creations-chat 2021-10-09 16:34:58 it‚Äôs all vanilla and doesn‚Äôt look good
creations-chat 2021-10-09 16:38:11 Don‚Äôt use default landing gear. Use motors for control surfaces, use motor lock for better detail on smaller builds, shape your wings so they aren‚Äôt sharp on the ends, don‚Äôt have any 90¬∞ angles,
creations-chat 2021-10-09 18:38:56 youre*
creations-chat 2021-10-10 15:00:52 looks nothing like an f22, too fat, intakes are way too small, vector nozzles look nothing like an F22, gear is way too low to the ground (use motorlock next time) not sure whats up with the flaps in the middle of the wings but those arent there irl. overall if you want to make a better f22 I would up the scale and integrate motorlock into your builds
creations-chat 2021-10-10 15:05:48 id say the colors are the only issue, use less vibrant colors for a more realistic look

im giving constructive critisism
creations-chat 2021-10-10 15:12:31 Its mainly the paint, I think with a desert camo paint scheme or a digital navy blue or black camo paint scheme it will look better

creations-chat 2021-10-18 02:17:56 <@!725185242973077545> give feedback on J20 or youre not getting your social credit back
creations-chat 2021-10-18 02:30:42 go cry, this is what happens when you send a J20 in <#384025409945337856>
creations-chat 2021-10-18 02:40:25 I am sorry PCC for sending a J20 and being unique causing a political argument in <#504436696021204992>

creations-chat 2021-10-18 02:44:55 I am now going to test the waters with my reaper drone that has a controversial bomb on it
creations-chat 2021-10-18 02:48:23 its ironic because its a bomb getting dropped on an innocent village with politically charged symbols on it <:trollface:775024642104229898>

creations-chat 2021-10-18 02:55:17 time to test the wonderful world of <#384025409945337856> to see if PCC likes freedom
creations-chat 2021-10-18 02:59:31 people dont understand that the trans bomb is ironic, because I cant figure out how to roundout the nose to make it drone shaped
creations-chat 2021-10-18 03:02:27 since pcc doesnt like freedom, chinese military aircraft are what im gonna stick to from now on. GLORY TO THE CCP Âêë‰∏≠ÂÖ±Ê¶ÆÂÖâË•øÈÄ≤Âπ≥ üá®üá≥

creations-chat 2021-10-18 03:18:13 i dont know if I should take the blame, i just posted a J20, then a reaper drone with a cluster bomb that had a trans flag on it
creations-chat 2021-10-18 03:22:06 <:trollface:775024642104229898> it has been fun completely swaying this channel over the past half an hour purely because I posted a chinese jet

creations-chat 2021-10-18 03:50:19 I need feedback on my starship/superheavy stack
creations-chat 2021-10-18 03:52:55 booster detail I can do but hiding the motors is kinda hard considering everything is camera/motorlocked

creations-chat 2021-10-19 00:25:48 not a 747 nose
creations-chat 2021-10-19 00:27:50 its going to be an H-6J nose once I figure out how the fuck im going to motorlock trails to where I can shape the windshield correctly, shaping the entire nose was a pain in the ass.

whats even worse is that the gear is super fucking big so I have to make a bypass to make the gear retract comfortably
creations-chat 2021-10-19 00:34:35 I have to make some complicated ass motorlock to make the gear fold comfortably with the gear doors
creations-chat 2021-10-19 00:37:31 already looks like a h6
