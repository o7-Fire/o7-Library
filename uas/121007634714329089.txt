creations-chat 2018-12-16 21:27:20 I had to clear data to save it and I didnt name the slot it was in so I saved over it
creations-chat 2018-12-16 21:27:41 I dont really remember
creations-chat 2018-12-16 21:27:45 At one point there was
creations-chat 2018-12-16 21:27:55 Had some helium in the back that made it flip over
creations-chat 2018-12-16 21:28:33 I mean I remember most of how that vtol was built it would only take maybe an hour to rebuild, most of which would be spent with controls
creations-chat 2018-12-16 21:28:40 But still it's really annoying
creations-chat 2018-12-16 21:33:33 OH MY GOD

help 2018-12-26 17:09:53 I removed the middle one and all it did was make me fall off the tracks
help 2018-12-26 17:10:37 it was 15 speed...
help 2018-12-28 21:46:21 honestly I have no idea how to use wing panels
help 2018-12-28 21:46:31 when I use the automatic controls, they work like crap
help 2018-12-28 21:46:40 when I set my own, they barely work
help 2018-12-28 21:47:05 so I basically have to chose between bad controls that work or good controls that dont work very well
help 2018-12-28 21:47:21 ~~essentially I dont know what im doing and so it doesnt work~~
help 2018-12-28 21:48:18 sorry not wing panels, control panels
help 2018-12-28 21:52:16 ah I see
help 2018-12-28 21:54:05 well while you're here, I don't suppose you could help with this as well: I was attempting to make my tardis fly, but it kept rolling and flipping over. So I decided, hey, if I make the top out of helium and the bottom out of balasts, any attempt to roll over should straighten out because the bottom will be forced under. So I did that, except it still rolled over
help 2018-12-28 21:54:20 am I just severely misunderstanding how physics work or why doesn't this work?
help 2018-12-28 21:54:59 it wasn't moving forward, just up

help 2018-12-28 21:56:30 I mean its not like its super unsymmetrical
help 2018-12-28 21:56:37 literally a square
help 2018-12-28 21:57:37 ...
help 2018-12-28 21:57:46 I dont think this game goes that far into depth
help 2018-12-28 21:58:02 this is a game were a block of helium can get you to escape velocity
help 2018-12-28 21:58:04 no, it doesn't
help 2018-12-28 21:58:40 *steinfeld theme*
help 2018-12-28 21:59:13 yes actually please do because I am really confused as to why it doesnt work lol
help 2018-12-28 21:59:34 ~~not that it matters the save deleted it but I can pretty easily recreate it~~
help 2018-12-28 22:00:47 I will go through the design and see if I placed a stray block
help 2018-12-28 22:01:52 dude the game doesn't use a realistic physics engine
help 2018-12-29 00:46:51 <@328413257092169729> the first motor turns it, say, right at 20. Then the second turns left at 20. They cancel out. The bottom spins at 20 and the top remains still
help 2018-12-29 00:49:17 <@194241218811658240> not sure, had that happen to me. I did 2 things: 1) rejoin (might do nothing, I did this first and then did step 2) and 2) I didnt alter what it looks at. It might just be that when you turn the cameras to look at something they end up getting locked in place (maybe so they dont turn/fall from the direction they are supposed to be pointing in)
help 2018-12-29 00:51:44 Also cool looking... thing. Lol didn't see it very well but looked cool, especially with the... unrendered engines?
help 2018-12-29 00:52:47 I probably can't but I'm certainly willing to try

bug-reports 2019-01-08 20:45:34 Every so often firing rockets ends up launching you (more with some builds than others). No idea why this happens, or what sorts of things make it more likely to happen and, as far as I can tell, nothing consistently does it but it does happen, sometimes frequently

help 2019-01-18 22:22:24 how do you build small fighter jets
help 2019-01-18 22:59:55 new question: how to I make automatic controls work?
help 2019-01-18 23:00:28 I have several planes that work fine with keybinds but the moment I use automatic controls the thing starts to shit itself as it wobbles and shakes and, in many cases, doesnt even turn
help 2019-01-18 23:02:33 like tf is it doing with this little .000000000000001% turn on the control surfaces for yaw so it can turn in 4 hours
help 2019-01-18 23:03:00 basically, how do I make automatic controls turn via roll and pitch so it can atleast somewhat function
help 2019-01-18 23:04:49 yeah I know that part
help 2019-01-18 23:05:05 but after I get the surfaces in the right places, it seems like the automatic controls only want to use yaw to turn
help 2019-01-18 23:06:12 1 sec
help 2019-01-18 23:11:38 ok sounds like ur right because I tested it with my best plane and (while it was still rather slow while turning) it wasn't doing the wobbly stuff

help 2019-01-18 23:12:47 I guess its just crappy fighter design causing the auto controls to not work on my mini fighter builds
help 2019-01-18 23:14:52 I just wanted to use mouse cause I have heard its better for fighers as it makes aiming easier
help 2019-01-18 23:15:08 also when I try to control it, my aim sucks because im tilting all over the place
help 2019-01-19 20:37:09 does the center of mass being under the center of lift have an effect on flight?

creations-chat 2019-01-21 17:55:10 my first heli :D its only real "features" are the bent wings and (in the front) a gun that can be tilted up and down (hey I never said it was unique) though there is also oh hole in the top which the blades are attached to, I find it makes the heli more stable in flight (someone else designed this, I just used it, sorry idk the guy's name)

help 2019-01-23 23:08:25 https://gyazo.com/a1c85f3dc59f27b21f71b03f4163bfa3.gif how can I get the center to float without spinning with the rest of the wheel? the motors are unpowered, the hope was that would keep it steady but it didnt really work out that way
help 2019-01-23 23:10:25 also a movement system would be appreciated as using the motors powered doesnt work and using rockets on the center wheel doesnt work
creations-chat 2019-01-24 19:54:36 lets play will the bot work with gyazo
creations-chat 2019-01-24 19:58:08 the correct answer is no
creations-chat 2019-01-24 20:00:27 I made a spitfire a while back but never posted it so... yeah? it flies pretty well and has pistons to push the front landing gear up so it has that angle, tho the landing gear can't go to the sides like they should because the game doesnt do that. oh and it has missiles on the bottom but thats just for pvp. anyway hope you like it :D

creations-chat 2019-01-24 21:02:25 I think he meant agera
creations-chat 2019-01-25 01:27:07 I made a bigger and better wheel :D this one handles far better, can move faster without bouncing and turning itself, can turn while moving, and can tackle some small hills. Also I think it looks nicer (at least design wise).
