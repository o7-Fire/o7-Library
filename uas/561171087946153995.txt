bug-reports 2021-06-17 08:58:46 BUG: blacklist doesnt work against parachutes. So basically, i joined a game, and on my plot there were already a bunch of unattached parachutes. i tried to blacklist the dude who placed them there but the parachutes didnt go away
bug-reports 2021-06-17 09:00:06 yeah i did
bug-reports 2021-06-17 09:01:47 lag
bug-reports 2021-06-17 09:02:13 there were a lot of them, covering the entire plot
bug-reports 2021-06-18 05:02:18 pretty sure its a ping issue or something like that, might be wrong though
bug-reports 2021-06-18 05:04:11 yes i know, it has happened to me as well
bug-reports 2021-06-18 05:04:37 well, if it isnt ping then i have no idea

creations-chat 2023-06-24 17:55:05 "Yo can anyone please help me"
"..."
"Yo can anyone please h-"
"Shut the fuck up."
creations-chat 2023-06-24 18:01:29 I mean, tbh, you also shouldn't be picky about the help you're getting, what matters is getting help at all, no? So try out some of the suggestions mentioned before, such as the subreddit etc
