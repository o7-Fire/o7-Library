creations-chat 2023-06-29 18:27:42 In Plane Crazy, the challenge lies in pushing the boundaries of complex construction techniques and impressing others with your creations. The game's difficulty stems from trying to exceed your previous achievements and create intricate designs that stand the test of time. By opting for the easy route, such as using a 3D software that allows for effortless creation, the fun factor diminishes.

The constructions in Plane Crazy, even with their occasional flaws and imperfections, contribute to the game's longevity. Players continuously strive to outdo themselves, fostering an environment of growth and innovation. The Hall of Fame in Plane Crazy's Discord serves as a testament to the remarkable creations achieved by dedicated players who understand the value of pushing the game's limits.

While some may label the builds as "jagged," "blocky," or "underdetailed," it's important to recognize that these aspects are part of the game's unique charm. Plane Crazy's emphasis on intricate construction techniques and realistic flight mechanics encourages players to think creatively and problem-solve within the limitations of the game. It's this challenge that keeps the community engaged and passionate about their creations.

Ultimately, the beauty of Plane Crazy lies in the journey of learning, experimenting, and surpassing oneself as a builder. It's not just about the end result, but the process of pushing the boundaries and embracing the complexities that make the game truly enjoyable and rewarding.

bug-reports 2023-07-10 10:35:12 Engines on "lock" and "powered" to make angle locks often bug on builds with more than 1000 blocks, and this is amplified on builds with more than 15000 blocks. This bug is well known but I think that most plane crazy players are often affected by it
