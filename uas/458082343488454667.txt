bug-reports 2023-03-11 01:08:33 when respawning after getting blacklisted, flight ui is still visible
creations-chat 2023-03-16 18:03:33 i think the reason half the builds in <#384025409945337856> are trashed on is bc people like to compare them to hof builds/far better builds
"oh an average player is trash compared to a pro"
build standards should be based on how the majority of players build and not just the top 1% or lower

wood is the lightest material in plane crazy
creations-chat 2023-03-16 18:07:34 yes
bug-reports 2023-04-29 22:29:39 (i apologize if this is already known, but i could not find it in pins)
when missiles regenerate while moving at high speeds they won't respawn in the right spot
it may also just be conveyor engine thing (guys don't use conveyor engines they are glitchy)
