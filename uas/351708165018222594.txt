The Tale of therednebula (351708165018222594)
creations-chat 2019-08-26 22:48:03 Well heck, I’m gonna try and get my behemoth of a plane on here for some sweet internet attention
creations-chat 2019-08-26 22:48:53 Tomorrow though, the computer I play on is not mine
creations-chat 2019-08-26 22:57:40 Also, because beams exist and lag is a thing at some point, I don’t see why the ranks are based on block count
creations-chat 2019-08-26 23:00:33 How submit?
creations-chat 2019-08-29 15:45:47 You can screenshot on mobile
creations-chat 2019-08-29 15:52:40 Also, to follow up my post from a couple days ago, my child:
In game tag: jonahhex7
Creation: CHN-9US mk III
Block Count: ~1,460 (forgot exact)
creations-chat 2019-08-29 15:54:38 I have no idea why the screen shot tool decided to show outside the window on the first one
creations-chat 2019-09-26 04:48:23 Ship side-by-side with the dock for scale
creations-chat 2019-09-26 04:49:28 ...and then everything changed when the fire nation attacked.
Creation: Fire Navy Cruiser
Username: jonahhex7
Block Count: 2056
creations-chat 2019-09-26 04:49:48 I guess it won’t be in creations then
creations-chat 2019-09-26 04:51:19 Also, it folded at base
creations-chat 2019-09-26 04:51:52 Wow, literally skipped over the one post I wanted to go there
creations-chat 2019-09-26 04:55:35 No one has recognized it in game when I asked them about it too
creations-chat 2019-09-26 04:55:55 A couple did after I told them what it was
creations-chat 2019-09-26 04:56:47 It has a below deck with a furnace and engine room
creations-chat 2019-09-26 04:57:35 It does also have a bunch of other empty rooms I’m too lazy to decorate
creations-chat 2019-09-28 17:40:41 I think you might be thinking of the stargate puddle jumper because that doesn’t at all look like a liset
creations-chat 2019-09-28 17:41:17 Or a mantis or scimitar
bug-reports 2019-10-15 16:42:11 I looked at the bug fix in announcements and that’s not the only thing that makes them shake, they will also shake violently if they are suspended on pistons for some reason
bug-reports 2019-10-15 16:51:22 I tried making a ball turret and it started to shake when I tried to make it deployable with a piston
creations-chat 2019-10-15 16:57:41 Did some refurbishing to my fire navy ship from a while back.
Blocks: 2265
creations-chat 2019-10-15 17:01:53 I think I over engineered the folding mechanism, but I don’t see a lot of folding ships that hide the motors
creations-chat 2019-10-15 17:03:39 Also the downvotes are traitors to the glorious fire nation
creations-chat 2019-10-23 03:32:02 Made a pt boat for pvp
creations-chat 2020-03-02 23:06:36 quick throw-together of a stable plane with hover engine thrust (on my alt), not really all that powerful it looks like.
creations-chat 2020-03-02 23:07:42 shown speed is about max
