The Tale of runawayrailfan (909585866190626847)
the-dump 2023-01-18 03:11:45 Hear me out, I destructible bridge in PC2, both for trains and cars, it could switch from normal to broken in just one click, I just wanted to share that idea that I had off the top of my head, I hope ideas are allowed
help 2023-01-19 05:46:00 Bro that’s like falling onto a highway and blaming the vehicles for hitting you
help 2023-01-19 05:46:16 Man I hate train trollers
help 2023-01-19 05:46:38 They either fling you, shoot you, knock you, or mess with the points
help 2023-01-19 05:46:46 WHILE you’re on them…
help 2023-01-19 05:47:54 I realized that if I step out of my seat while I’m holding the forward button, my train still drives without me, that’s how I started a runaway…
help 2023-01-19 05:48:26 Cause I thought to myself, hey! Why not jump out of an unmanned giant moving train?
help 2023-01-19 05:48:38 What a great idea
help 2023-01-19 05:49:02 But it was actually fun until I didn’t get to change some points in time and the thing went flying
the-dump 2023-02-28 05:42:41 Do you think that like how there are already wheels and tank treads premade, do you think there will be premade train wheels? Both steam and diesel/electric bogies?
