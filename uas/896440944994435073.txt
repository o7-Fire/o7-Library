bug-reports 2021-12-29 05:02:28 exactly
bug-reports 2021-12-29 05:40:32 It's still a necessary ping. Rick needs to know what could potentially be harmful to the whole server. It is logical to inform him of this especially. I made sure of this by pinging him.
bug-reports 2021-12-29 06:34:01 because it lagged the whole server
bug-reports 2021-12-29 06:34:14 whats stopping the person from joining a server lagging it to hell
