creations-chat 2022-02-09 15:28:12 In my defense im not on my pc rn
creations-chat 2022-02-09 15:32:33 Ill take some higher res photos when i get home
creations-chat 2022-02-09 15:37:39 Totally what it stands for
creations-chat 2022-02-09 15:43:03 ^^
creations-chat 2022-02-09 15:45:17 Ok, when i get home today, I will take some TRUE NASA quality pictures
bug-reports 2022-02-09 15:48:27 Probably already been said, but jetpack controls are broken, I have to look up just to go up, its kinda cringe not gonna lie
creations-chat 2022-02-09 15:50:50 It's the mando version, the mandalorian version looks different than the normal N-1
creations-chat 2022-02-09 15:53:16 I agree with you on the tail of the engines, but don't know how I would manage to motorlock the rest, since the motorlock on the vehicle already is super unorganized

I would just have to rebuild the whole thing tbh

creations-chat 2022-02-09 16:14:38 It's always "star Wars kinda bad" and never "IHBP, F, J, ASTMNE. YNE? DMMKY. AMAITTR, TD! IYNWM, TYME. OASDAA, IWDWIM. YWT.
creations-chat 2022-02-09 16:35:08 Motorlocking would be hard to do with a monster truck (in terms of handling) but I can try ig
creations-chat 2022-02-09 18:30:51 It's bc people have incredibly high standards
creations-chat 2022-02-09 18:34:46 If it doesn't have at least 600 blocks of just motors alone, 25 motorlock towers, 12 Bits of exposed motorlock,  18 Bits of non exposed motorlock, and it's not a real life fighter jet or tank then no one will care, simple as that
creations-chat 2022-02-09 18:39:39 I agree that down votes help, but my point still stands that only fighter jets/fighter planes or tanks do way better then the ones that arent
creations-chat 2022-02-09 18:42:44 I have 2 giant builds that don't consist of motorlock that i feel people would like, people in the servers like them so maybe people here would

Although people here tend to have much higher standards then people in servers
creations-chat 2022-02-09 18:46:40 I'll show 1, because the other is too hard to fly on mobile
creations-chat 2022-02-11 14:26:08 I never sent memes in general?

creations-chat 2022-02-27 05:41:37 Learn motorlock
creations-chat 2022-02-27 05:44:28 Make the red side facing the motors, and also i mean complex motorlock
creations-chat 2022-02-27 05:50:02 Bro it looks like it has the wings of a very stretched yf-23, the engines of a SU-47, and the front of a F-14 with side flaps
creations-chat 2022-02-27 05:52:06 That actually looks sick ngl (and personally i like exposed motor lock because it makes builds seem more complex or "tough")

<@!733552827342782474> ok and
