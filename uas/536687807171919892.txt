the-dump 2020-11-05 14:30:34 As a person who’s installed many windows, that makes me wanna cry
the-dump 2020-11-05 14:31:15 Imagine how much all of that costs
the-dump 2020-11-05 14:31:26 That’s like 30k in just windows
the-dump 2020-11-05 14:31:42 Not including labor

help 2021-07-18 16:18:21 A 5x5 track wheel is way to big
help 2021-07-18 16:18:49 I don’t even use 5x5 cylinders on my trucks
help 2021-07-18 16:19:52 This is my 300SL with a 3x3 wheel
help 2021-07-18 16:20:03 And it looks like a giant wheel
help 2021-07-18 16:42:28 I’d run through that other spaceships mechanism and see what’s different, a lot of times when I’m building certain concepts and borrow things from builds I have trouble replicating
help 2021-07-18 16:44:01 Aerodynamics maybe?
help 2021-07-18 16:45:44 Are you just trying to go straight up? If so just put a little helium on the top
help 2021-07-18 16:46:28 Okay that’s more difficult
help 2021-07-18 16:46:58 That’s a aerodynamic problem along with weight distribution
help 2021-07-18 16:47:27 Make sure it’s perfectly symmetrical
help 2021-07-18 16:48:03 Lol I’m not the best either but I’ve ran through the numbers
help 2021-07-18 16:49:05 Is that front and back or side to side
help 2021-07-18 16:49:47 So if it’s too heavy in the rear put some ballast blocks on the front
help 2021-07-18 16:49:54 You can fine tune ballast blocks
help 2021-07-18 16:51:23 Either make it lighter in the back with helium or weight it down in the front
help 2021-07-18 16:51:35 I think making it heavier would be the best option
help 2021-07-18 16:51:43 Helium can make things unstable
help 2021-07-18 16:53:18 Big builds have better weight distribution
help 2021-07-18 16:53:22 Cause leverage
help 2021-07-18 16:54:18 Alright
