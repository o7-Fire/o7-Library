creations-chat 2021-03-21 17:14:56 VTEC¬†(Variable Valve Timing & Lift Electronic Control) is a system developed by¬†Honda¬†to improve the volumetric efficiency of a¬†four-stroke¬†internal combustion engine, resulting in higher performance at high RPM, and lower fuel consumption at low RPM. The VTEC system uses two (or occasionally¬†three)¬†camshaft¬†profiles and hydraulically selects between profiles. It was invented by Honda engineer Ikuo Kajitani.[1][2]¬†It is distinctly different from standard VVT (variable valve timing) systems which change only the valve timings and do not change the camshaft profile or valve lift in any way.
