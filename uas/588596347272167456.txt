bot-central 2020-07-28 21:16:40 from what ive learned, the mods are getting tired of people leaking the links or something like that so they just make them not availible

creations-chat 2020-09-03 22:30:43 are you actually saying, that they should remove motorlock
creations-chat 2020-09-03 22:32:03 obviously you have never once had a single braincell inside the empty pit that some would call your skull, you absolute imbicile, you dull witted loser, you absolute abomination.
creations-chat 2020-09-03 22:33:32 wait, were you actually trying to say that bcuz most people dont use motorlock that it should be removed? are you really that mentally ill?
creations-chat 2020-09-03 22:34:33 boby
creations-chat 2020-09-03 22:34:36 you know what
creations-chat 2020-09-03 22:37:57 boby you absolute empty skulled, no braincelled, complete lack of any reason or common sense, slow minded idiot, i have never met someone quite so stupid
creations-chat 2020-09-03 22:39:06 wait wait wait, so your saying that if people are too stupid to make their builds look as good as others then all should suffer? are you really that stupid
creations-chat 2020-09-03 22:39:47 did your mother drop you on your head a few too many times and now you cant think correctly?
creations-chat 2020-09-03 22:40:26 nah nah nah, i bet it your mother actually realised just how stupid you were at birth and put you up for adoption
creations-chat 2020-09-03 22:42:16 boby, tell me how a person is half as wide as they are tall and then we will talk
creations-chat 2020-09-03 22:43:35 idiot of the century goes to, bobyblobfish
creations-chat 2020-09-03 22:44:09 boby the fucking idiot
creations-chat 2020-09-03 22:46:59 boby, how are you even this stupid? your argument makes no sense, you say that because some people are to stupid to figure out how to motorlock that all motorlock should be removed, seriously, this sounds like a toddler whining about how something is too hard and that if they cant do it then nobody can, i seriously wonder if you even hear half of the shit that comes out of your own mouth you absolute simple minded idiot
creations-chat 2020-09-03 22:50:52 boby, here is the bottom line, if rick says, that its not a bug, then its not a bug, because he is the developer and he says whats a feature and whats not
creations-chat 2020-09-03 22:52:32 boby, its not a glitch, if rick says he means for it to stay AS A FEATURE, then its not a glitch, just how stupid are you
creations-chat 2020-09-03 22:55:34 hmm, lemme tell you how its trash, ok first off, it looks like absolute shit, it seriously looks like my younger cousin, who is 5 came onto the game and built something random, second, how is it effiecent, there is no effiecency in this game
creations-chat 2020-09-03 22:56:26 hold on i gotta show this guy what wouldnt exist if we didnt have motorlock
creations-chat 2020-09-03 22:57:57 guys guys, motors are glitch bcuz they move and thats not fair to things that dont move, we have to remove them
creations-chat 2020-09-03 23:05:50 bloby you say you like realistic things right? well what about this https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/672985768746156074/751214615530176563/unknown.png

https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/672985768746156074/751215593251930118/unknown.png or this

guess what
im only able to acheive this level of detail with motorlock you dumbshit
creations-chat 2020-09-03 23:08:50 boby, its ok to have an opinion, but your opinion is just incorrect
creations-chat 2020-09-03 23:09:03 rick even said its a feature
creations-chat 2020-09-03 23:10:25 GET EM PURI
creations-chat 2020-09-03 23:10:57 ABSOLUTELY CRUSH THIS EMPTY SKULL'D CHILD
creations-chat 2020-09-03 23:13:08 puri needs to grind this idiot into idiot dust
creations-chat 2020-09-03 23:14:41 boby, you dont seem to understand, that rick wants motorlocking to be in the game
creations-chat 2020-09-03 23:14:48 meaning
creations-chat 2020-09-03 23:15:06 that if rick wants it in the game, then its obviously not a glitch
creations-chat 2020-09-03 23:19:06 my fucking god, this guy just doesnt listen to anything we are saying, he cant understand, in his little pea sized brain, that because rick WANTS motorlock in the game, it is no longer a bug, its only considered an exploit if the developers dont intend for it to be used like this or they dont like it, but because rick likes it, it is most definitely not a bug <@!502211422718263307>

creations-chat 2020-09-21 14:00:31 Why is the community upvoting builds that are super low effort and look like garbage?
creations-chat 2020-09-21 14:02:25 I will agree that there is block count bias, however, there is some really crappy stuff that ive seen get 30 upvotes
creations-chat 2020-09-21 14:02:39 Like that stupid tonk thing
creations-chat 2020-09-21 14:03:04 I could quite literally make that in 5 minutes
creations-chat 2020-09-21 14:03:52 The panther A isnt great either, however its much better than the tonk
creations-chat 2020-09-21 14:04:16 I just dont understand
creations-chat 2020-09-21 14:04:57 I want it to go back to when people were posting quality builds and the occasional bad build
creations-chat 2020-09-21 14:06:06 Yes thats what i mean
creations-chat 2020-09-21 14:06:30 I think the community is just becoming undes
creations-chat 2020-09-21 14:07:43 Its fucking annoying
creations-chat 2020-09-21 14:07:59 We need a clensing
creations-chat 2020-09-21 14:10:09 I think what is happening is the community is split in 2, with one side being the older members and better builders snd the other side being the newer members with build standards lower than the mariana trench
creations-chat 2020-09-21 14:11:05 At this point in time i could post my shitty 5 month old builds and get 70 upvotes

creations-chat 2020-10-05 14:47:13 "working on the game"
creations-chat 2020-10-05 14:47:58 its extremely hard for me to believe he is seriously working on the game bcuz trapdoors havent even been fixed yet
creations-chat 2020-10-05 14:48:34 cuz yes
creations-chat 2020-10-05 14:49:47 <@!746383586755870821> the problem with waiting for roblox to fix it is that roblox is even slower than rick when it comes to updates, it could be many more months before trapdoors are fixed
creations-chat 2020-10-05 14:50:35 and at that point i would just fix trapdoors with this current version but save the previous code for if they fix it

creations-chat 2020-10-12 11:38:40 Motorlock pulls blocks down by half a block
creations-chat 2020-10-12 11:39:19 It has downvotes cuz its kinda not good for a creation of that size

creations-chat 2020-10-12 11:43:14 Well, this communities standards have dropped so much since when i joined, back in the day my 109 would have been lucky to get 20 upvotes, and your arguing over a couple downvotes?
creations-chat 2020-10-12 11:45:13 Its because of the huge amount of braindead idiots who dont know what a good build is bcuz they cant build well themselves
creations-chat 2020-10-12 11:46:18 Its really sad to see a community turned into what we currently have
creations-chat 2020-10-12 11:48:40 Well, the og people left bcuz upvotes have no merit anymore, they are guarenteed upcotes if they post something even just average, the new people just upvote everything and its basically ruining the premise of creations

creations-chat 2020-10-12 12:08:10 Well i mean how hard can it be to make a wedge, you take the 1x1 and extend it  and then take the hitbox and stretch it

creations-chat 2021-01-08 17:50:30 Colors are easy, just make a bit of variation in the blue, make areas where more dirt/exhaust darker or things like that
creations-chat 2021-01-08 17:52:49 Link?
creations-chat 2021-01-08 17:55:03 Im not a fan of the colors, it has too much contrast to be a winter camo, other than that its just a kind of basic looking build.
creations-chat 2021-01-15 18:26:02 Hahaha thats so shitty
creations-chat 2021-01-15 18:28:03 <@450005202511200256> imagine fucking smooth brain, its not even a real pixel art, you just edited a picture onto ur plot dumbass
creations-chat 2021-01-15 18:40:32 The pixel size gave it away? U sure it wasnt the blatant flat edge of the image that gave it away
creations-chat 2021-01-15 18:42:56 The fact that people who dont even know what motorlock is have ranks is dissapointing
creations-chat 2021-01-15 18:45:19 Bruh, how, i knew about motorlock before i even joined pcc, i think we are just letting in a bunch of tards nowadays
creations-chat 2021-01-15 18:48:09 I havent posted anything in this server for a long time cuz it means nothing. Shit builds get 50 upvotes daily. Whats the point in posting here anymore
creations-chat 2021-01-15 18:50:49 https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/384025409945337856/799503584903299072/Cargo_Ship.PNG heres one 52 upvotes for an ugly ass brick they they call a boat
creations-chat 2021-01-15 18:52:50 I think one of the last creations i post in this server is gonna be my creation that im going for master aero with.      And then ill prob get banned for calling some autistic kids garbage build a steaming pile of shit
creations-chat 2021-01-15 18:54:51 Not the ugliest ship ive seen, the siding is lacking a lot of detail so its kinda meh.        Might just be the grainyness of the image tho
creations-chat 2021-01-15 18:56:56 Motorlock is the key to greatness. If you find it disgusting then well.... shows your level of building doesnt it?
creations-chat 2021-01-15 18:58:59 Piston lock is better in some situations, but overall yes, it looks better.      Makes it possible to move blocks a qaurter or less.      The piston can move less than half a block what else is there to explain
creations-chat 2021-01-15 19:02:05 The piston locks, then the motorlock releases, the block on the piston is however much higher the piston went than the rest of blocks
creations-chat 2021-01-15 19:05:12 Its really simple to understand...
creations-chat 2021-01-15 19:14:10 English please.      How so

creations-chat 2021-02-11 20:51:08 Confused on how to feel about this, on one hand its above pcc average creation shit, but on the other its rlly plain.        Cant decide, fix up the wing shape and add some color variation and it gets a upvote from me
creations-chat 2021-02-11 20:54:16 Slight color variation, darker underside, darker exhaust area, make just very slight variations
creations-chat 2021-02-11 20:58:46 If i made a zeppelin with 1 color it would look bad right?
creations-chat 2021-02-11 21:02:36 Just do some basic shading
creations-chat 2021-02-11 21:05:36 Its not, it just makes it look better
creations-chat 2021-02-11 21:07:59 Just take a look at Fortune_Foxx's airship, he used color variation and shading, and it looks good. Granted he used a wider color gradient than i would for that plane, but it still shows
creations-chat 2021-02-11 21:10:38 Well, thats part of it, but the colors are very monochrome and stale, even just a few number difference would make it look better
creations-chat 2021-02-11 21:13:23 Indeed, i fully agree
creations-chat 2021-02-11 21:15:26 Pcc went from being mostly upvotes and a few downvotes everyday to, downvote pretty much everything and every once in a blue moon an older player will post. And then i finally upvote
creations-chat 2021-02-11 21:17:27 Thats usually what i do except for cases when i see something that could be easily fixed
creations-chat 2021-02-11 21:19:38 Make the wings solid and not full of holes, ailerons smaller and more towards the back of the wing, and hide the elevator motors inside the plane
creations-chat 2021-02-11 21:21:45 No no no, dont layer the gradient, make it layered but a lil randomized.      <@508065143905845248>  you better watch what you say
creations-chat 2021-02-11 21:24:22 I dont post anything cuz it has no merit, i just show the people who i know are good builders and can therefore give me accurate feedback
creations-chat 2021-02-11 21:26:31 Not rlly, pcc is full of noobs who dont even know how to piston lock, and most of pcc's good players got banned bcuz of jokes.     Yes, thats why i only show the good players, bcuz people who dont know how to piston lock will just say its good, i see shitty builds getting 70+ upvotes all the time
creations-chat 2021-02-11 21:30:27 I will when i get home, send me a friend request on discord so i can find you again, ive gotta drive home so i cant type

creations-chat 2021-02-22 17:27:56 Then ur camo was too blue, make the blue a tint, not the other way around.   Your darkest one was too big of s jump from the other colors
creations-chat 2021-03-04 17:25:24 <@664210806543613973> dude, your "tons of motorlock" is literally just the beginner shit motorlock, all you do is put rockets into the plane. You cant say tons of motorlock like that is high effort
creations-chat 2021-03-04 19:08:28 It looks like you just took your basic plane, cut it in half so you could seem pro, and then did a rocket tower
creations-chat 2021-03-04 19:10:29 It seems to me that you think that is amazing motorlock, but its more like a noob who just found out what motorlock is
creations-chat 2021-03-04 19:13:59 Guy who made a trash xp55 saying that he did more than just a rocket tower, even though you could make the exact same plane without any motorlock
creations-chat 2021-03-04 19:16:26 You literally just took the lower half of your plane off and motorlocked it. Oh, and im pretty sure you cant make my planes without motorlock
creations-chat 2021-03-04 19:19:00 hold on, your saying you have over 28 days playtime, and your builds are still the same as public server builds?  Also phoeni, that tower design is the most common cuz its the basis of all motorlock, it compresses into a 1x3 log of motorlock, making it easy to add stuff to builds
creations-chat 2021-03-04 19:21:13 Ok but i doubt you were afk for 20 of those days cuz it seems like you have the skill lvl of 8 actual days
creations-chat 2021-03-04 19:26:01 Im saying that for someone who has 28 days playtime you would expect higher quality.      Have you tried to learn how to make more complex things?
creations-chat 2021-03-04 19:31:33 Bruh, you post an image with a caption saying "i bet this will get downvoted" and then when people call you out for being shit, you cant handle it? Idk man, seems like a 9 year old thing to do

creations-chat 2021-04-23 19:53:34 Thx
creations-chat 2021-04-23 19:56:40 Just wait a while
creations-chat 2021-04-23 19:59:31 Planes do not look good. Watch as argument starts
creations-chat 2021-04-23 20:04:14 What
creations-chat 2021-04-23 20:06:17 Those wings actually pain me.   Also are those flaps.   Why didnt you just angle the wings, it looks rlly bad like that
creations-chat 2021-04-23 20:09:11 Wdym by wow guy.   You gonna answer?
creations-chat 2021-04-23 20:15:10 Ok, so why did you say hater guy.   So im a hater bcuz i said ur wings were nasty? I mean i guess but if you cant take critisizm then you shouldnt post
creations-chat 2021-04-23 20:20:01 I dont have anything posted because i havent posted recently, the community went to shit and now everything gets easy upvotes. Also the last time i posted was so long ago that it was before you coukd send directly in creations, so you have to search for mentions of me in creations to find them
creations-chat 2021-04-23 20:23:16 Exactly, thats why i use commas whether i write a essay or not.
creations-chat 2021-04-23 20:26:25 Ok listen, first off, im saying use commas to show what you are actually trying to say, it is quite easy to misunderstand a sentance with no commas. Second, you are probably one of the last people anyone will listen to seeing as you have no rank and probably just joined.   It doesnt have to be a perfectly made sentance, just one thst you can get the feeling of.
creations-chat 2021-04-23 20:29:41 If you dont understand commas then that is your own problem, do not harp on people who use commas to express emotion, especially since it is quite common.   Also how was i meant to understand that him just saying "hater guy" is a joke.
creations-chat 2021-04-23 20:31:52 When did i ever try to make fun of someone for not knowing english. Im pretty sure what i did is say that it is your own issue if you dont know what commas are
creations-chat 2021-04-23 20:38:27 Not specifically talking about you, talking about the other guy who is trying to justify his ignorance of the english language in an english only server
creations-chat 2021-04-23 20:41:14 Dont joke about a dead family member, thats disgusting
creations-chat 2021-04-23 20:43:24 If you would have joked about my uncle you would hope i never find your adress. And i saw the image, he said his mom was dead, and then you continued. Sorry is there a whitename talking?
creations-chat 2021-04-23 20:45:57 Expert designer isnt that much of a flex... you know that right?
creations-chat 2021-04-23 20:50:39 Yes, you quoted me, good job i guess, idk what point you are trying to prove here
creations-chat 2021-04-23 20:52:43 Whitenames dont get any respect because they are newer players, and they dont have a rep, other than being a whitename
creations-chat 2021-04-26 14:31:48 Looks like shit my guy
creations-chat 2021-04-26 14:39:08 Doodoo fart stinky plane.   If ur gonna do a complex camo, then use wedges do we dont have to see the blockyness
creations-chat 2021-04-26 15:57:11 Looks like a hollowed out shit
creations-chat 2021-04-26 19:47:42 Terrible.   That is quite bad.   Why do the guns look like that, why is the paint so disgusting.
creations-chat 2021-04-26 19:50:18 It really does look like a 30 min build. A 30 min build except its really bad. You THINK it looks to green? Dumbass it looks like an algea covered lake
creations-chat 2021-04-26 19:54:48 Yes, dont post trash in creations or creations feedback.   Bro look at any of the guns, they look terrible
creations-chat 2021-04-26 19:57:05 Basically, look at an average build, and then compare it to your own build, you can tell its bad. Also im going to be like this to most people in this server cuz most everyone makes shit
creations-chat 2021-04-26 20:00:17 So basically, you are bad at making anchores so you just didnt make one.   Tardis thats the point
creations-chat 2021-04-26 20:06:11 So basically, its this thing that keeps a ship in place, i misspelled it because im on my phone right now, sorry that you couldnt understand a simple spelling mistake. But it might help a little to pay attention in school and make inferences based on context.
creations-chat 2021-04-26 20:08:35 When did i write the bible you dumbfuck. And do you seriously not know what an anchor is?
creations-chat 2021-04-26 20:11:00 Is that your only response? Nice
creations-chat 2021-04-26 20:13:01 A new angle does not make it any less shit
creations-chat 2021-04-26 20:17:11 Delete it and make something new, its worth -500 quid
creations-chat 2021-04-26 20:19:59 Your opinion is so unpopular that the north korean government is deciding to execute you despite your love for kim
creations-chat 2021-04-26 20:25:29 Lemme see, first of all, it looks like a bean with a flagpole on it, second the paint is so atrocious it makes anyone who sees it immediately angry, third, the fact you actually think its good makes me think this community is somehow getting worse. You think that it looks good, but it looks so ugly that i literally hate it with ever essence of my being.
creations-chat 2021-04-26 20:27:31 If they are anything like THAT then no, they are quite possibly some of the worst
creations-chat 2021-04-26 20:31:41 Its as bad as i thought, unpost that please, it hurts my eyes
creations-chat 2021-04-26 20:35:27 Its true tho. Im sorry but i feel no mercy for that idiot. Just scroll up
creations-chat 2021-04-27 12:10:18 I only talk shit to people that need to be talked to
creations-chat 2021-04-27 12:13:02 If ur creation is so bad, that i, who hasnt posted anything in creations for over a year, has responded, then it needs fixing or deletion
creations-chat 2021-04-27 12:16:42 Indeed its already half done
creations-chat 2021-04-27 12:18:43 Hold on lemme see if i have one, im on my phone rn
creations-chat 2021-04-27 12:20:46 There
creations-chat 2021-04-27 14:17:12 You see, they just dont like *your*  sailboat. Oh god, i was gonna say it wasnt the worst ive seen, but then you posted an image from the back
creations-chat 2021-04-27 14:19:19 Was it posted in plabe crazy, or just a build in the game. If it was just a build then u cant report it, no in game moderation
creations-chat 2021-04-27 14:21:21 Its just fuckin flat. His sailboat
creations-chat 2021-04-27 14:23:22 I said the back. Also, again with the +100 toxicity, shut the fuck up, if me saying their build is bad is me being toxic then how is anybody supposed to give critisizm, if you cant say, that is bad, then they wont fix it
creations-chat 2021-04-27 14:27:12 First off all, you boat is high off the water, second, the back should narrow a lil, third the image that you posted isnt even flat, it has a hole in it. Im gonna say it plain and simple, it doesnt look good
creations-chat 2021-04-27 14:31:24 Delete it and retry.   Im literally just saying they are bad.   Stop making 3 wheeled cars, they dont look good
creations-chat 2021-04-27 14:34:23 https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/686788994507210766/822532143351463996/unknown.png also considering i build entire planes out of trails, yes, i prob would have high standards. But i wasnt the only one who said delete it, so why are you only going after me?
creations-chat 2021-04-27 14:36:26 No duh shitass, im talking about the fusulage
creations-chat 2021-04-27 14:38:37 I literally started using the advanced angling techniques extensively 
 even before guggi.  The one i have is that image, im taking a break from it cuz im going to have to pistonlock all the front trails and im lazy
creations-chat 2021-04-27 16:03:45 The tail is made of trails
creations-chat 2021-04-27 16:06:51 Start the fusulage over. Basically, it doesnt look like it at all. So delete and start over
creations-chat 2021-04-27 16:10:19 Indeed, have you ever tried this thing called,looking at blueprints?
creations-chat 2021-04-27 16:12:26 So you looked at them, did you build your plane off those blueprints. Send the blueprints you are using
creations-chat 2021-04-27 16:14:28 Send the blueprint you are using. Thats not a blueprint dumbass. No wonder it looks wrong, you dont have any sense of scale
creations-chat 2021-04-27 16:17:42 You are supposed to use blueprints to get you scale, length and width, measurements basically. A 3d model is for getting angles on the plane correct, so finer detail. So first find a bluepri t. Seriously, find one.   K send it
creations-chat 2021-04-27 16:20:07 Send it. Dude, literally just search blueprints of ur plane, then go to images
creations-chat 2021-04-27 16:22:53 K, so right away you should be able to tell whats different between ur original and the blueprint.   Urs was a pencil, the blueprint shows that it widens out at the end of the plane
creations-chat 2021-04-27 16:24:54 Yes, look at the blueprint, do you see how it widens out. Box person.   Im not sure what wedges you should use, since i would just use motor angling
help 2021-04-27 16:27:23 Dude thats just the start
help 2021-04-27 16:27:55 I cant go into detail cuz lunch is almost over, but im just gonna say its all pretty damn bad my guy
creations-chat 2021-04-27 16:28:10 Prob not
creations-chat 2021-04-27 20:10:45 Ok so wait, you are supposedly 13, but you dont know what wip means.  Somethings off here.
creations-chat 2021-04-29 14:28:30 These guys, slightly idiot perhaps.  Pepsi that was me being tame. Every person responding to eryay saying f22 is a fucking idiot
creations-chat 2021-04-29 14:32:18 Yes, all ww2 era fighters were the same layout, front engined, large front wing, cockpit behind wing, and vertical and horizontal stabilizers in the back
bot-central 2021-04-29 22:33:56 !servers
creations-chat 2021-04-30 14:24:35 So basically ur saying, because its low effort and idiots cant understand anything more complicated than a block. Ok good thing we can agree that this community is shit
creations-chat 2021-04-30 14:26:36 Its not hard to, you are just incompetent. Yes rbk, that is what i said
creations-chat 2021-04-30 14:30:57 Pcc members trying to figure out that your name in the server isnt your discord username.  Literally braindead
creations-chat 2021-04-30 14:36:18 Fix ur terrible creations. Rbk, for once im actually not, this guy deserves to be bullied, if you think im toxic then you havent seen this guy
creations-chat 2021-04-30 14:39:43 Yes, thats how i give feedback, and again, this guy is worse
creations-chat 2021-04-30 16:05:18 I dont think im the best pcc player, i just think that people could use their brains just a little bit more and build stuff like they actually have the brain of a 13 year old, yes i realise that nobody is going to build out of trails like i do, i dont expect that, i just expect to see something better than a below average public pvp build getting 100 upvotes, or a 9 block boat getting 100 upvotes. Me saying "that build is bad" is still feedback, i use feedback like that because guess what, most things i comment on are things that look like they were made by my younger cousin, who is the age of 7
creations-chat 2021-04-30 16:08:30 Would have responded earlier to the argument, but i was in class.
creations-chat 2021-04-30 16:10:34 That was me responding to someone saying that making 3 blade props is hard, so he never asked for feedback.   Also saying that build is bad is feedback, its letting them know that their build is not good and needs to be better
creations-chat 2021-04-30 16:13:28 Yes, my standards are high, but if i were to actually see something atleast a lil above public server levels i would consider not downvoting it.  But unfortunately, thats all i see these days, shitty builds with low effort and lots of upvotes for no reason.   No, i dont judge like that, i judge based on first of all, if it looks good, and second, if i can tell that there was actual effort put into it
creations-chat 2021-04-30 16:16:20 Who is pyro. Prob dont know cuz i stopped caring about pcc a year ago after huge influx of hive mind 9 year olds who think shredder bugs are cool.  After that i lost hope in pcc, cuz the community turned to shit
creations-chat 2021-04-30 16:20:06 <@466793357318815744> OMG OMG COMRADEALX IS BEING A BIG MEANIE TO A NEW PLAYER WARN HIM RIGHT NOW
creations-chat 2021-04-30 16:23:10 This is literally what happened to me an hour ago
creations-chat 2021-04-30 16:27:30 Bruh, you say people mass downvote? If they mass downvote then ur build must be terrible, i saw a 9 block boat get 120 upvotes earlier and it prob took 5 mins to build
creations-chat 2021-04-30 19:33:27 If it isnt equal then u must be doing something wrong. Is the torque at max?
creations-chat 2021-04-30 19:54:16 Step 1, the landing gear is connecting and it isa piston used for suspension, step 2, you are dumb
creations-chat 2021-04-30 19:56:34 First of all, what the fuck are you talkin about with motor 2, second, its a piston you blithering idiot
creations-chat 2021-04-30 19:59:38 I think, pepsi, that this guy may or may not be competent enough to understand and observe with his eyes
creations-chat 2021-04-30 20:04:59 I didnt say he was, but i also didnt say he wasnt. There isnt a problem with the bottom of his do 335
creations-chat 2021-04-30 20:07:01 The urge to say something about that specific image, you are very lucky pepsi is watching. IM GONNA DO IT, IM GONNA SAY SOMETHING
creations-chat 2021-04-30 20:11:05 All the tanks in that image are so shit that it makes me physically hurt looking at them, its actually appalling looking at that image, you can even tell with the black abd white that the tanks are just solid colors, the fact you have friends that shitty and uncapable of using a single percent of their brains to make something is quite depressing and i quite honestly wish i could unsee that shithole of a gathering

creations-chat 2021-05-04 19:30:06 LOOOOOO THE UNDERTALE PFP UPVOTED IT HAHAHAHA, HIS STANDARDS MUST BE AT A NEW LOW FOR PCC.   Dude, im not being mean, im literally saying that your build isnt good my guy, you could put hours of effort into it but if it looks like that, im gonna downvote it, you see, i dont judge based on effort, i judge based on looks, so if it looks bad, im gonna downvote
creations-chat 2021-05-04 19:33:38 Its as simple as that <@839144467926876252>
creations-chat 2021-05-04 19:35:40 Looks more like a 100 block black and cyan brick that floats. I mean you've gotta try harder than that if u want upvotes, i mean, you are 13 right? Start acting like it and build something that looks like a 13 year old made it instead of something my 7 year old cousin made
creations-chat 2021-05-04 19:38:35 That would get a downvote from me. First, ur landing gear, do i rlly have to go into detail about it? Second, ur intake walls are thicker than ur wings. Third, ur wings have holes in them
creations-chat 2021-05-04 19:41:08 HES true
creations-chat 2021-05-04 19:43:25 1) yes you can, just use your brain a little.
2) if you really cant think of any other idea, then you have a skill issue
3) i can literally see thru them... wtf are you talking about
creations-chat 2021-05-05 16:14:38 of course I downvoted it, its 1 solid color, you cant tell where the hull starts and the bridge begins, try experimenting a little with colors, because making the entire ship 1 color doesnt look good
creations-chat 2021-05-05 17:30:29 HES TRUE
creations-chat 2021-05-05 17:32:51 not originally made by herr guggi, i made those treads a full 2 months before he even made his test, and herr guggi keeps trying to say that they were made by me originally, i swear to god, learn to fucking read
creations-chat 2021-05-05 17:39:41 well you see, herr guggi has said, multiple times even, that it was not originally him, you may not have made the image, but you still posted it

creations-chat 2021-05-06 02:19:03 the legs could definitely be shaped better, and the body could be modeled better. other than that its not bad, but it just isnt an appealing build
creations-chat 2021-05-06 02:23:04 ok, thanks for not starting an argument like literally everybody else that asks me for feedback
creations-chat 2021-05-06 02:25:04 first, what even is that.      HES TRUE
creations-chat 2021-05-06 02:27:16 ok dude, the cockpit is supposed to stick out of the fuselage, not meld together like that. that doesnt look good tho....
creations-chat 2021-05-06 02:30:25 HES TRUE
creations-chat 2021-05-06 12:38:07 The simple fix would be balast at the bottom and helium above the balast, i had the same problem with my alluette, and the problem is called dissymetry of lift, for more info on what ut is just search it up, you will understand whats happening, the way i fixed it was with small props inside the heli that could be powered to keep it level. So i have my main wasd qe controls, and i also have tfgh controls for fine movement
creations-chat 2021-05-06 12:40:50 It works, but it makes the flight seem so cartoonish that its not even fun. Did you look up what dyssemytry of lift is?
creations-chat 2021-05-06 12:43:40 Another simple fix, this one might not be possible, but its to decrease blade angle, a lot, and just have it spin fastee. The way dyssemytry of lift works is the advancing blade will get more lift, and the retreating blade will get less, thats why it will roll when you move forward
creations-chat 2021-05-06 12:45:59 Irl helis counter it with auto gyros. Which isnt rlly possible
creations-chat 2021-05-06 16:14:17 Rudy. You.    Imagine crying over a downvote and then wanting me to get warned for downvoting creations that i dont like
creations-chat 2021-05-06 16:18:57 <@462891443673890827> imagine
creations-chat 2021-05-06 16:25:25 All of it my guy, all of it
creations-chat 2021-05-06 16:28:17 Hes true. Looks like you tried to grab upvotes by adding unnecisary motorlock
creations-chat 2021-05-06 19:25:13 Ok, i dont judge based on how long it took, and so what if im the only person that downvoted it, that means you cried about a single downvote
creations-chat 2021-05-06 19:30:54 Real
creations-chat 2021-05-06 19:34:23 Its literally only 1 color. Theres barely any fine detail. The turrets look like actual trash
creations-chat 2021-05-06 20:21:00 You cant if you have my username. Or atleast thats what rudy and solee think.  I have a feeling they just dont like me
creations-chat 2021-05-06 20:23:01 Ok here mat, add weathering, your creation shouldnt look like 1 solid color. Add slight color changes throughout the ship, so have your basic color and then a color just a few numbers off, the psint near the bottom of the ship shoukd be slightly darker than the top
creations-chat 2021-05-06 20:25:25 No
creations-chat 2021-05-06 20:31:40 Like i said, add a slight color variation, so make a color similar to the 1 u have now, and randomly apply it on ur ship. And add a slightly darker variation of ur main color near the botton. Its hard to explain to a person that doesnt know paint techniques
creations-chat 2021-05-06 20:35:14 Also send an image of what it looks like rn
creations-chat 2021-05-06 20:37:44 Fusulage, not hull
creations-chat 2021-05-06 20:39:46 Apply darker color *randomly* near the bottom. It shouldnt look like a second waterline
creations-chat 2021-05-06 20:42:08 Yes kinda like that, now use a darker color for the grey
creations-chat 2021-05-07 11:54:33 FUNNY
creations-chat 2021-05-07 12:22:31 Make the lines out of delta wing panels.   Fuck it, make the whole ship outa trails
creations-chat 2021-05-07 12:24:51 Wdym how, you motorlock the delta wings into the deck
creations-chat 2021-05-07 12:30:49 Prob just a single motorlock
creations-chat 2021-05-07 12:33:05 Dont listen to kookie, he is the german speedbumb that people call belgium.    Wtf are you talking about kookie, im over 50% german
creations-chat 2021-05-07 12:36:52 Prepare for rating.   It looks like shit, why is it a solid color of green, literally the ugliest color u could find.   You asked for rating, dont try to defend urself
bot-central 2021-05-10 00:28:00 !servers
creations-chat 2021-05-10 12:33:05 False, i havent
creations-chat 2021-05-10 12:35:07 Never. Eternal punishment. How do you even manage to get blacklist
creations-chat 2021-05-10 12:37:08 The wings :agony:
creations-chat 2021-05-10 14:37:26 It doesnt, but ok, you do you
creations-chat 2021-05-10 14:40:26 Who said i needed to ask for permission to speak
creations-chat 2021-05-10 16:04:23 Fix the gap in the wings
creations-chat 2021-05-10 16:08:02 Elevators are meh, motorlock them inside the plane so you dont see the motor. Other than that its ok, would prob try to cover the space under the rudders a bit more
creations-chat 2021-05-10 16:30:10 No
creations-chat 2021-05-10 20:23:54 Notice something? Your gear doesnt even fold away
creations-chat 2021-05-11 12:34:54 Rudyx21? More like poopy idiot who wanted to get me warned for downvoting bad creations
creations-chat 2021-05-11 12:40:40 Rudy just doesnt like me bcuz he got a single downvote on his monocolored ship, that downvote was me.  Forgot the name of it
creations-chat 2021-05-11 12:42:59 https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/504436696021204992/839552243568607252/1212.png this is the one, cant even tell where the deck begins and the superstructure starts.    Bcuz i can see straight thru the bottom of that car
creations-chat 2021-05-11 12:56:54 What im saying, is that there is 0 color difference in his hull. And also that he cried over a single downvote
creations-chat 2021-05-11 14:17:51 Trust me, this community is so dumb, someone would upvote
creations-chat 2021-05-11 14:25:11 Basically, restart the wings, unless u want ur wings to look like paper
creations-chat 2021-05-11 16:11:56 I have a 1x1 missile, get on my level.   You are false
creations-chat 2021-05-11 16:17:49 Who is that
creations-chat 2021-05-11 16:21:07 Not the words i would use to describe that plane
creations-chat 2021-05-11 19:47:16 He isnt saying that he downvoted bcuz he doesnt like other things, he said he downvoted it bcuz he didnt think it did a good job of looking like it was supposed to
creations-chat 2021-05-11 19:49:24 Why dont u just make the plane out of trails<:trollface:775024642104229898>.  Obtain realism
creations-chat 2021-05-11 19:51:47 Its not even that hard, it just takes 20 mins longer than the average pcc player attention span. And thats why i never see it, until the day when i see something in pcc that truly amazes me, there will be no upvotes.   Start cryin.  Too bad if you think my standards are too high, continue to cry over your single downvote
creations-chat 2021-05-11 19:55:07 Shut up fartwrangler.  Theres a no rank in chat, come back when you have... hmmmmm...... a role<:trollface:775024642104229898>
creations-chat 2021-05-11 19:57:46 NOOOOOOOO THE FATAL INSULT. HOW COULD YOU
creations-chat 2021-05-11 20:35:25 True, everybody hates me bcuz they cant handle a single downvote.   Dude thats literally just double wishbone, also ur terrible at hiding motorlock
creations-chat 2021-05-11 20:37:55 Wtf are you talking about IR scope thingy.   Ill tell you what to improve on emir, first off, relable them as average seats, xuz thats all they are
creations-chat 2021-05-11 23:05:20 You and rudy wanted to get me a warn bcuz i downvoted ur creations
creations-chat 2021-05-11 23:58:02 No, he is right, you are wrong, the armor is angled so it diverts more energy in another direction other than thru the armor
creations-chat 2021-05-12 00:01:05 I doubt that
creations-chat 2021-05-13 12:43:01 First of all, it seems to be leaking something blue, oh wait that's just terrible rockets, use hover drives, second your pitch motors are very clearly visible. Also your wings are like cheese graters. Finally someone who can take criticism
creations-chat 2021-05-13 12:45:04 Yeah also that use wedges to fix that up
creations-chat 2021-05-13 12:51:49 To an extent
creations-chat 2021-05-13 16:13:09 When plane crazy "13 year olds" see a block with wheels on it: omg omg its so good im going to upvote.   This is literally all of creations rn
creations-chat 2021-05-13 16:18:02 Not even close to the truth? Obviously you are one of the people that is upvoting everything. Also, its true, saw a shitty plane, with shitty camo, and absolutely unnecicarily massive, with 200 upvotes. It makes no sense.   Xfinity, im not complaining about my builds not getting upvotes, i stopped posting long long ago, im saying this community's sense of what is good and what is bad is literally that of a public server
creations-chat 2021-05-13 16:22:31 Yup...... lunyro, im not saying i base my judgement on how long it took, to me, that plane up there looks like shit, so i downvoted. Im saying that you people, think that shit, looks rlly good
creations-chat 2021-05-13 16:26:54 Yes, but the standards have lowered a lot, that is the point i am making. Prefered the way it used to be, where i wouldnt constantlt see public server builds in creations
creations-chat 2021-05-13 19:40:26 Actual idiocy, it looks like crap.    I wonder why, maybe its because builds these days are literally a fucking ***M I C R O    W A V E***
creations-chat 2021-05-13 19:42:46 Its not hard to see why i downvote, everything in this server is shit.   Including your shitty microwave.  You see, the difference is that he has a rank, unlike you.
creations-chat 2021-05-13 19:45:29 <@725358947904651335>  you have been in the server how long? A month maybe? You have absolutely 0 respect as a person who has just recently joined and is a shit builder. So stop talking you insignificant shithead.
creations-chat 2021-05-13 19:47:31 Im assuming you looked at my latest post in creations?   Shows how much ypu know joshua, the last time i posted was back when the bot posted builds in creations
creations-chat 2021-05-13 19:50:25 So then im guessing you saw my plane made of trails, and my half finished zeppelin. Joshua, how stupid are you, did you literally not see me say that a bot used to post creations
creations-chat 2021-05-13 19:53:30 You might actually be mentally impaired, here lemme try to explain this in the way a toddler such as yourself can understand, that was the only way you could post back then.  Indeed. Never said i was the best, i said you guys are shit, but i never said i am the best
creations-chat 2021-05-13 19:55:48 Go ahead, try to quote me on when i said that i am the best builder. Out of context
creations-chat 2021-05-13 19:58:29 Yes. Ive already agreed that i said peoples builds are trash, but i dont think im the best, i know people who are better.
creations-chat 2021-05-13 20:03:47 I literally never said that nobody is better..... i said you guys are trash, im not gonna keep repeating, you are literally making false claims that can be easily disproven.  Provide a qoute, go ahead. Find a qoute where i said that nobody is a better builder than me
creations-chat 2021-05-13 20:08:35 Where did i say i was the best
creations-chat 2021-05-13 20:10:36 You still havent provided a quote where i said im the best
creations-chat 2021-05-13 20:12:45 ^agree, it started with some person who has been in the server for a month crying over a downvote from me. This entire argument has basically been me explaining why i think 99% of the server is trash builders, and then people who dont like me trying to say that i did something i didn't
creations-chat 2021-05-13 20:21:57 Yes, i would agree, there are people who are better than me, fortune being one of them, but im pretty sure that as a person who has been playing this game for years, seen the community fall into the shithole that it is now, has had credit stolen many, many times, befriended many of the best builders I've seen, had respectable people asking for help and feedback from me, that i have quite a knowledgable database of what is a "good" and "bad" build
creations-chat 2021-05-13 20:28:22 Listen lunyro, i wouldnt be such a "mass downvoter" if yours, and most other builds werent public pvp level builds. If i didn't have to see daily shit, then yes, i would prefer that, atleast pcc could be respectable again
creations-chat 2021-05-13 20:31:34 Exactly. Lunyro is probably mad that he got a downvote from me and now he is just trying to get back at me
creations-chat 2021-05-13 20:33:43 Again, i wouldnt downvote every build if they werent bad, what you are basically saying here, is that because i dont like any builds i am automatically toxic
creations-chat 2021-05-13 20:36:08 Yes, im probably toxic in that regard, but when you watch a good community fall apart and crumble into standards so low you dont even know if its better than public servers, its gonna make you feel no mercy or pity
creations-chat 2021-05-13 20:38:33 Saying "i have good builds" with no rank or backing is probably the most egotistical thing you can do
creations-chat 2021-05-13 20:41:03 Like i said, i feel no remorse, it shouldnt be that my first build ever posted looks better than half the stuff people post nowadays
creations-chat 2021-05-13 20:44:28 Would have been shorter if these guys can just aknowledge that i dont like their builds and deal with it like most people
creations-chat 2021-05-13 20:48:57 <@419477639229865984> You see, mega, everyone has their opinions, my opinion is that pcc is shit now, if you dont like it, then you can shut up and ignore it, but by you trying to say that my opinion is bad, and your opinion is good, that is you just trying to silence someone who doesnt agree witg you. Also who the fuck even is pyro
creations-chat 2021-05-13 20:50:58 Oh boo hoo you got a downvote, waa waa, oh no i cant believe zach downvoted my build because he thought it was bad, waaaa waaaaa, im gonna go complain about it in creations feedback
creations-chat 2021-05-13 20:53:01 Literally just tell people that im not mass downvoting. I just dont like the creations, and if they dont like that i think none of their creations are good, then too bad. Incredible
creations-chat 2021-05-13 21:15:06 tie your fingers together and stop typing, pepsi already said to shut up

creations-chat 2021-05-14 20:09:51 How is that even possible, i woke up at 6 am, and rn its 15:00
creations-chat 2021-05-17 12:33:57 I have entered the chat. Hmmmmmm, who do i insult today.
creations-chat 2021-05-17 12:35:59 I dont think it looks good. (It has started<:trollface:775024642104229898> ).  When the, i give reasons for why i downvote, but people still call me mass downvoter
creations-chat 2021-05-17 12:49:05 Imagine thinking I'm mass downvoter when i literally gave a reason for downvotes. 95% of the time i say i simply do not like what they made
creations-chat 2021-05-17 12:53:41 I wouldnt downvote a lot if the creations had 5 more minutes of actual thought put into it
creations-chat 2021-05-17 14:09:47 Ye, i upvoted a lot of stuff, just nothing recently.... its more just dissapointing than anything else. Fortune_foxx's zeppelin was one of them
creations-chat 2021-05-17 14:13:43 Ye, and then the problem with that is when i am polite about it, some no rank with an ego the size of a truck comes in and says i have no right to critisize. Therefore, i have no need to be polite if the community is a bunch of "13" year olds with egos to big
creations-chat 2021-05-17 14:15:56 That sounds like a terrible idea, ive seen stuff that people say they spent days on, but it looked like it was from a public server
creations-chat 2021-05-17 14:18:44 HerrGuggi is typing...    hestrue
creations-chat 2021-05-17 14:22:26 Wouldnt be that bad if the fusulage was not full of holes and things protruding, and also if the wings were smooth and didnt have that jagged edge
creations-chat 2021-05-17 16:21:30 Ever heard of this thing called motorlock?  That literally everyone uses.  Actually stupid, motorlock is literally 1x3, if you cant fit it, then there might be something wrong with you
creations-chat 2021-05-17 16:25:54 Im not gonna be polite to people who call me a mass downvoter. Also if you cant figure or how to do Motorlock then cmon, really? You can't say you don't have enough space, it's literally compacting blocks, i made a 1 wide plane with motorlock, so don't even try to say you don't have enough space
creations-chat 2021-05-17 16:28:04 If by mass downvoting, you mean downvoting builds that i dont like, same as everyone else, then yes, i mass downvote
creations-chat 2021-05-17 16:30:27 Im literally not, i just downvote and then people say "why did you downvote" i respond with why i dont like it,  then people say I'm mass downvoter, most of the time, i dont say anything about creations unless im asked for why i downvote
help 2021-05-17 20:06:42 Image
help 2021-05-17 20:07:30 Do you mean ur plane is slow?

help 2021-05-17 20:09:26 Terrible idea
help 2021-05-17 20:12:36 Cuz there is no throttle control
help 2021-05-17 20:13:32 Sorry but im not a person that aproves of the idealogy of a public pvp player that enjoys 0-1000 in 1 second
help 2021-05-17 20:16:51 So then, your issue is what?
help 2021-05-17 20:18:56 Or ykow, you can just use hover drives
help 2021-05-17 20:19:11 Which is about 20x easier
help 2021-05-17 20:20:22 U just put a hover thrust pushing off a motor,
help 2021-05-17 20:20:55 So you said ur problem is that your plane is slow?
help 2021-05-17 20:21:13 Cant rn cuz im on phone
help 2021-05-17 20:21:37 But its literally just a hover thruster with the bright parts facing a motor
help 2021-05-17 20:22:45 Not particularly
help 2021-05-17 20:23:32 Is speed ur problem, like sps, or does it just look like its flying slow
creations-chat 2021-05-17 20:26:21 Now watch, as rbk doesnt try to explain that you are rude and toxic, because he has double standards
creations-chat 2021-05-17 20:29:41 90% of the people in this server are like that, i see people with only designer and their egos are fucking massive. And then i get berated for downvoting some shitty truck and plane. The entire community saying im a mass downvoter, even tho i explained that i simply dont like the builds
creations-chat 2021-05-17 20:31:41 Would you like to explain how i have double standards?
creations-chat 2021-05-17 20:36:22 Most of the time im polite to begin with, unless its just really really bad, and at that point its just me saying what everyone is thinking. It's only when people are calling me a mass downvoter for no reason and saying i should be warned for something like that(solee and rudy) that im going to be rude. Other than that i just downvote and everone goes on their way, theres no need to complain about a single downvote
creations-chat 2021-05-17 20:40:58 Also, when somebody asks for feedback from me on a rlly bad build that wouldnt get an upvote from me, what else am i supposed to say except delete and restart.
creations-chat 2021-05-17 20:43:28 First, that gap in ur wings, can be fixed with motorlock, next, so can the elevators, looks like cheese grater, next, the camo is blocky, other than that not bad
creations-chat 2021-05-17 20:47:44 Its these little things that earn downvotes from me, things that i know are easy fixes. Name one BQ_nk
creations-chat 2021-05-17 20:51:13 Go ahead, name one. Ill disprove tou right now, ill start with the fact you said "really good shit" this would imply that everyone has the same standards and that your standards are the correct ones. This is where you are wrong, for you see, other people, have other opinions, mind blown right?
creations-chat 2021-05-17 21:01:26 <@386274857668706314> would you stop being a keyboard warrior for 5 seconds and shut the fuck up? All you do is say the same thing "you downvote everything" even though ive disproved this numerous times, the fact you won't accept that i just have high standards and go on with your life is annoying. And the more you keep saying "he downvotes good builds" the more i want to punch your face in. Try learning that there is a world where someone might not agree with you and get over it.
creations-chat 2021-05-17 21:08:14 people when i downvote a build that is apparently "illegal" to downvote: https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/504436696021204992/843957614302855238/804439412497973278.gif
creations-chat 2021-05-17 21:10:47 EXACTLY. GOOD JOB, YOU ARE DESCRIBING WHAT IVE BEEN SAYING FOREVER.
creations-chat 2021-05-17 21:29:15 it seems odd to me that you cant accept that i just have high standards. just because you don't see anything in creations rn that i have upvoted, does not mean that i don't upvote. i never said, this is good and this is bad, you have to agree. i don't start arguments simply because i want to, i only respond to other people. the only thing i have done, is state my opinion, call you a spoiled brat that has trouble coping with a world with other opinions, and downvoted builds that i don't like. what have you done? you have claimed i am something i am not(a mass downvoter), you have claimed that your opinion on what is good and what is bad is the right one(you saying i downvote "good builds"), and you have repeated your same argument, over and over, in a hope to get other people to agree with you. so lets summarize here. i have downvoted builds that were, in my opinion, not good, you have claimed that i am a mass downvoter for this. i then respond to people who ask for feedback, where my response is usually "restart your build, i cant think of a way to give an upvote without building it a different way" and when i say this i realize that there is often some miscommunication, i do not aim to be rude when i say that. i just phrase it like that for a lack of another way to say it.
creations-chat 2021-05-17 21:37:06 prob cant cuz he is unde
creations-chat 2021-05-17 21:43:41 why did the other people downvote a warning. exactly, shut the fuck up. sorry pepsi, tired of idiots trying to make a point they cant prove and providing "evidence" that doesnt even make any sense
creations-chat 2021-05-17 21:50:15 i dont expect people to make things to my standards, thats why theres a downvote button, i judge on my standards, as do you on yours.
creations-chat 2021-05-17 21:54:13 why should i lower them, people should just not complain over my singular downvote. yknow thats an option too.(people complaining about numbers over the internet moment)
creations-chat 2021-05-17 21:59:34 so what you  are saying is, you cannot vote on something, which is not up to your standards? that is completely wrong and entirely throws the idea of public voting out the window, and the fact that people have different standards.

creations-chat 2021-05-18 16:26:42 <@456226577798135808> wonder why ur getting so many downvotes. I really just, couldnt imagine why you would get downvotes.
creations-chat 2021-05-18 16:30:26 Chernobyl lizard vs tin can
creations-chat 2021-05-20 12:04:41 I hate that. Looks like ur trying to make a pencil fly. It seems like you tried making a ta 152. First off its too long, next, its too skinny, the ta 152 is not that thin
creations-chat 2021-05-20 12:08:01 You made it too thin my guy. While it doesnt have a radial like the fw 190 series it does have an inline, so its a very long engine, the nose should be a bit thinner near the front and get widest at the cockpit, you have done the exact oposite of that
creations-chat 2021-05-20 12:11:49 First step, stop scraping ur underside all over the pavement. Step 2, use motor angling so it doesnt look like you tried to make it as low poly as possible
creations-chat 2021-05-20 12:14:21 Then why ask for feedback if you "cant" do anything with it. Exactly.
creations-chat 2021-05-20 12:21:57 No, use angled motors. Also, the cowling should be 3x3. The 152 is not a small plane, it should be wider
creations-chat 2021-05-20 12:27:08 Its already too big if you want it to scale. I used to do the same thing, except i used pixel measurements so my planes were usually pretty acurate to the blueprint. But i used to make a bunch of german planes like the bf109, he 162, and the fw 190.
creations-chat 2021-05-20 12:36:52 Atleast its off tge ground now. Still low poly tho
creations-chat 2021-05-20 12:49:03 I said the body looked super low poly
creations-chat 2021-05-20 12:55:41 "A bit" im not gonna go into everything i highly dislike on that build, but ill just say, that is terrible
creations-chat 2021-05-20 14:12:36 How the hell, did you mistake a ta152 for a fw190
creations-chat 2021-05-20 14:18:08 Ye, but the d9 varient was barely used, as compared to other varients. Why not just make a fw190 f8 varient
creations-chat 2021-05-20 14:26:36 The designer ranks are worth 0 credit in pcc, all it does is inflate some idiots ego by about 500x.     YOUSUF MOMENT
creations-chat 2021-05-20 14:28:37 Yousuf, i havent posted anything in creations since the bot was used to post them. Then designer 5 idiots get confused cuz they are three and ask how i got ranks with no creations
creations-chat 2021-05-20 14:31:19 I could have gotten it for my working radial engine powered by magnets prob. Most likely not anymore, but a year ago when i made it i could prob have. No not a drive, an engine, as in it used pistons
creations-chat 2021-05-20 14:33:24 Radial engines? That actually work?    Ur probably right guggi
creations-chat 2021-05-20 14:37:35 Mr antonio gamer, what a nice name, i wonder if ur the age of 6<:trollface:775024642104229898>.    This is not a place to start a convo
creations-chat 2021-05-20 14:40:11 Ive spent enough time downvoting every shitty build to know that
creations-chat 2021-05-24 14:28:51 Its a low effort creation. Most likely going to be deleted
creations-chat 2021-05-24 14:37:40 First off, its just 2 tone. Add a lil color variation. Lets not start an argument im not in the mood. You people need to understand that theres such a thing as weathering, adding things like slightly darker spots near intake and exhaust
creations-chat 2021-05-25 19:50:44 Oh boo hoo, get over it.   Im not explaining why i downvote anymore, cuz you idiots choose not to listen
creations-chat 2021-05-25 19:57:21 Wouldnt consider that a city but ok
creations-chat 2021-05-27 12:35:37 <@727028164223696966>  a lil bit of weathering and stuff on that and ill upvote, honestly pretty good
creations-chat 2021-05-27 14:39:30 Have fun decifering between moving ur camera and placing blocks

creations-chat 2021-05-28 20:06:33 Top half of the fusulage and where it connects to the wings
creations-chat 2021-05-29 04:01:50 Look at where the wings connect to the fusulage
creations-chat 2021-05-29 05:08:42 Cuz i talked to hars and he said it was not meant to be like that
creations-chat 2021-05-29 05:12:19 Also, stop whining about downvotes, it is annoying, its literally a single person who doesnt like the build, in fact, it isnt even your build, so all you are doing is saying that your opinion is correct and mine is wrong. Now, please shut up, i am camping
creations-chat 2021-05-29 05:25:19 I said to stop pinging me.  I have given reasons for my downvotes when people ask for a reason, if you dont accept the reason then that is your own fault
creations-chat 2021-06-01 12:11:11 I would say your only problem is that the plane is fairly ugly, but i suppose that doesnt matter because it just lays the track out
creations-chat 2021-06-01 14:14:58 Well, kinda, if the build doesnt have a lot of effort it will usually look shit
creations-chat 2021-06-01 14:17:12 Incred community, i love when meme builds get upvotes
creations-chat 2021-06-01 20:03:44 Too much fartin
creations-chat 2021-06-01 20:05:54 I mean its bad. If you want me to go into more detail then say it, and dont be a baby about it when i point things out
creations-chat 2021-06-01 20:08:27 Agreed
creations-chat 2021-06-01 20:14:28 No point, thin treads require tank treads to be 2 blocks wide
creations-chat 2021-06-01 20:16:31 No point, would look rlly weird. Treads too wide for the tank.  Dont, it would look weird, ur tank is too small for the treads, your trwads would need to be 1 block wide
creations-chat 2021-06-01 20:19:37 <@410992368494575626> ok man, ive been holding back for a while now, but i need to know. Why do you keep making creations with that ***awful*** fade
creations-chat 2021-06-01 20:23:35 <@410992368494575626> you gonna answer?
creations-chat 2021-06-01 20:25:58 The fade is shit, and im tired of people pretending its good.  I never said anything about colors, go for the colors of you want, i just wanna know, why the bad fade, like atleast make it more smooth
creations-chat 2021-06-01 20:28:08 Wdym mad, i literally asked a question...     and wdym stop hating, im allowed to dislike something
creations-chat 2021-06-01 20:30:48 Why are you acting like this is a personal attack and im going to send a pipe bomb in ur mailbox
creations-chat 2021-06-01 20:37:50 Again.... when did i ever say that my opinion is correct? When i said, the fade is bad and im tired of people pretending its not, that was an obvious joke.
creations-chat 2021-06-01 20:39:59 Yes, i did say, that it was my opinion that i didnt like it
creations-chat 2021-06-01 20:45:41 List a creation, i can give a reason. Im not sure what you mean by, "no reason" as i always have a reason when someone **asks**. However im not just gonna list the reasons i downvote every time i downvote without anyone asking for it. If someone wants to know they can ask. Stop trying to fight on everyones behalf and worry about yourself
creations-chat 2021-06-01 20:54:34 He has pretty smooth builds sometimes, but the fade is very harsh and rushed, so it makes it look very blocky
creations-chat 2021-06-01 20:56:41 i just dont understand how people still think i dont have reasons when i downvote, after me explaining my reasoning to countless people
creations-chat 2021-06-01 21:01:07 cuz you just joined, have no reputation, other than earning one rn that says ur a dipshit who's ego is bigger than the titanic, and are now saying builds are bad when you havent even made anything to the level of public server standards
creations-chat 2021-06-01 21:03:26 if you dont care if people downvote you build then you shouldnt care if people say ur build is bad, since, yknow, thats what downvoting is
creations-chat 2021-06-01 21:07:04 "red arrows don't hurt anyone" is what ive been saying to idiots who keep accusing me of mass downvoting, they however, seem quite offended that i could possibly have an opinion on the builds i downvote, and try to disprove it every time i say it
creations-chat 2021-06-01 21:09:05 its usually hatefull cuz those tiny things that took maybe 10 minutes at the most get 100+ upvotes, its annoying to no end
creations-chat 2021-06-01 21:11:32 i literally dont say anything in this server unless someone asks why i downvote, which happens every day. except of course when i asked why you did fades like that
creations-chat 2021-06-01 21:18:05 possibly, the only thing is is that im usually the one that has to say to the other person that just because everyone else agrees does not mean i have to, which is usually why i get so annoyed at people, because the argument goes like how it went with altyz, they say that im the only one that downvoted, and thats their only thing they keep saying
creations-chat 2021-06-01 21:20:16 seyo said he is done arguing with a person with -4 braincells, thats why it ended

creations-chat 2021-06-02 12:28:38 The white is way too bright, the blue is too vibrant and almost looks neon, it moves around underwater, it shouldnt be clean, add a bit of variation to the white
creations-chat 2021-06-02 12:32:19 Doesnt need to be worn down, just make it look better by adding artificial shading on the underside of the side ridges. The shadows in game arent good, tgats why you add shading, also take a look at the zeppelin in hof, that has shading, that's why it looks nice, you add shading so you can tell what the exact shape is, cus rn it just looks like a white blob
creations-chat 2021-06-02 12:37:50 Also, saying you got the color pallet from the devs means nothing when they have a different shader. Your shoukd be darker to compensate for how bright roblox is
creations-chat 2021-06-02 12:43:43 Ok first of all, i know he shaded bcuz i can literally see it, and second bcuz im friends with fortune, i was there for most of the time he was making it. And i gave my feedback, either take it, or dont. Theres no need to argue
creations-chat 2021-06-02 12:50:20 No, prob not, if soneone told me my paint looked off i would fix it
creations-chat 2021-06-02 12:53:07 Yes, i downvote for lil things, thats already been cleared up, there are a few other reasons i downvoted your build, but this was the easiest to explain over phone
creations-chat 2021-06-02 12:55:24 Cuz its more detail stuff, if u want me to list, then i will. But i might not respond due to class starting soon.  The first thing i see is the paint, next is the shaping of the hull, it is extrememly blocky and needs some motor angling, and more builds components
creations-chat 2021-06-02 13:01:01 Indeed, not possible
creations-chat 2021-06-02 13:03:02 Well i downvoted for other reasons but i have to go to class rn, i can answer you in 80 mins if you want tho

creations-chat 2021-06-02 22:33:30 your saying people need a build to point something out?
creations-chat 2021-06-02 22:37:55 heres a lil proof if you want some, lets start with people who have said im a good builder, fortune_foxx, denied me when i said he was a better builder than me, tooti, literally just said im 100 times better than u, herr guggi, has and still does, keep telling me to finish builds bcuz he wants to see them. so thats just people, and then there is also the fact that i started making an entire fusulage out of angled trails just to get the body shaped right
creations-chat 2021-06-02 22:42:03 https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/686788994507210766/822487663368994826/unknown.png
creations-chat 2021-06-02 22:45:37 theres a very specific reason i dont post in creations, 1, i dont care about fame <:trollface:775024642104229898>, 2 i cant get feedback from this community because you guys are such babies that you cant point out things that are wrong.
creations-chat 2021-06-02 22:47:45 i tell people to rebuild stuff cuz i cant think of a way to fix it where it would get an upvote from me without building it completely differently
creations-chat 2021-06-02 22:49:47 how, i am giving feedback, im telling them what they would need to do, im not gonna say, "you can fix this" and then they fix it and i downvote it again, no, im going to tell them what they need to do to get an upvote from me, you dont need to listen to me. v literally exactly whats happening
creations-chat 2021-06-02 22:51:53 how, tell me one time where someone asked for a reason, and i didnt tell them a reason
creations-chat 2021-06-02 22:56:28 you want a creation on my standards, fortune_foxx's hof build
creations-chat 2021-06-02 22:58:54 i dont show cuz none of them are finished
creations-chat 2021-06-02 23:01:24 but it is to my standards..... why are you trying to say what my standards are? thats about the most moronic thing i think anybody has said to me in creations-feedback
creations-chat 2021-06-02 23:23:38 its funny that you call me kid, that is actually funny now
creations-chat 2021-06-02 23:26:27 ive literally given my reasons, the fact you are ignoring them and choosing to complain about downvotes is hilarious
creations-chat 2021-06-02 23:28:39 and what was my stupid excuse?
creations-chat 2021-06-02 23:34:13 your negative iq and terrible "proof" is probably the worst that i have argued with in creations feedback. you are literally disregarding my reasoning simply because it goes against what you are saying
creations-chat 2021-06-02 23:36:41 bruh, just look at one of my years old builds, that should be good enough, even though they look like trash. when did i ever say that BQ_nk
creations-chat 2021-06-02 23:39:17 hold on lemme get in game rn
creations-chat 2021-06-02 23:41:41 i usually dont give feedback on wip, cuz im not asked about wip

creations-chat 2021-06-02 23:47:44 exactly, i never sat down and said, im the best builder here, also, slayer, how stupid are you, there isnt a single block of helium in the build, its disconnectors, the holes in the wings are simply there cuz its a wip and i was just even seeing if my landing gear would fit, the prop is basic, idk what that means but cant tell if its a insult or not.
creations-chat 2021-06-02 23:49:52 you are literally trying to give feedback on a plane that is heavily wip and doesnt even have the bottom half of the tail
creations-chat 2021-06-02 23:51:53 i was asked to post it cuz these guys are idiots. icommit, you might actually have to, this guys braincells are through the floor
creations-chat 2021-06-02 23:54:06 the only thing you have proved is that you like to point out obvious things on a wip build
creations-chat 2021-06-02 23:56:41 no, i have high standards when somebody has asked for feedback on a completed build, not a wip
creations-chat 2021-06-02 23:58:51 obc, im sorry, im just having a hard time actually conversing with this guy, it is actually difficult to tell if he is being serious or not due to the stupidity of his posts
creations-chat 2021-06-03 00:01:21 i wasnt talking to you, was i? yeah i didnt think so, if you get provoked by it, then maybe you need a break.
creations-chat 2021-06-03 00:03:22 i was talking to obc, yes it was about you, but it was to obc, so why choose to respond? seriously, just stop

creations-chat 2021-06-03 13:21:55 At that point, why not make the main guns a explosive ball cannon
creations-chat 2021-06-03 13:24:04 No, i hate gustas, dont ping him
creations-chat 2021-06-03 13:26:11 Dont say that i dont wanna see another green blob with no other color on the vehicle. I hate when people just make solid color vehicles
creations-chat 2021-06-03 14:06:21 Its.... painful, to look at
creations-chat 2021-06-03 15:55:54 You mean my wip? ...i think your thinking of the wrong guy.... i only actually point things out on builds when someone asks for how to make it better, so basically only things in creations. Not wips
creations-chat 2021-06-03 16:09:17 Yes, thats the point.  It needs thick wings so they dont snap under the weight of the fusulage.   Ye, same reason
creations-chat 2021-06-05 21:47:54 Nobody likes it cuz its ugly as fuck
creations-chat 2021-06-05 21:56:15 Im not even gonna waste my time answering a question this dumb

creations-chat 2021-06-18 07:12:14 if you rlly wanna see join vip 1
creations-chat 2021-06-18 07:40:00 thank
creations-chat 2021-06-18 17:18:49 ok, im gonna start by saying this, if i see something that could use improvement then im gonna downvote to tell them there are things to be improved apon. thanks you for asking for feedback, not thank you for immediately assuming your kitchen has no flaws and calling me a mass downvoter. this might just be the style you were going for, and you dont need to change it necisarily, but the shelves on the right dont have a border and it just looks kinda off. the cupboards on the top left also dont have a handle on them so it also looks off, again, dont need to take it to heart, its literally just one guy saying your builds could have some improvements
creations-chat 2021-06-18 17:22:59 i do, but only if they ask for feedback, if they ask ill be happy to tell them, but im not just gonna ping them and tell them everything they could fix without them even asking for it. look at my message above
creations-chat 2021-06-18 17:25:22 is that good enough feedback? in the large edited message
creations-chat 2021-06-18 17:27:35 then its just my preference
creations-chat 2021-06-18 17:40:25 how about, you stop getting so butthurt about a single opinion. just take the downvote and realise you can fix something, or ask what needs fixing and do what you want, im not telling people they need to fix it, it really couldnt matter less to me.     not sure this is rlly a paragraph, but ok

creations-chat 2021-07-10 00:40:40 He was fighting with him tho.... are you a bit slow?      He was told to stop argueing begore and he didnt listen. Bruh, this is what im talking about when i say we need to purge all people who joined after 2019

creations-chat 2021-07-11 12:50:21 Ok, bad salamander, my non overcomplicated pvp salamander looks better than that

creations-chat 2021-07-11 13:03:42 I think i only used 2 angled motors, and that was for the top of the engine and the top of the cockpit
creations-chat 2021-07-11 13:05:44 Yeah, it was either i have my character able to see out of the cockpit and have a gunner sight or have a smoother cocpit

creations-chat 2021-07-11 13:14:18 I really wanna make the engine out of trails too, but i had already spent 4 hours trying to do that without any luck.  Yes much motorlock, very easy tho. I mean that tail section is made of 3 rows of motorlock, and its 2x2, the engine is like 1.3x1.6 i believe in my measuring. So far the hardest part is making the nose
creations-chat 2021-07-11 13:17:18 I have to make the trails angle to a half ball smoothly
creations-chat 2021-07-11 13:19:21 Ive already done some testing with it, and im debating between keeping my sanity and making it look good
creations-chat 2021-07-11 13:21:22 Ive been paying my sacrifices for 3 years, not much left i can sacrifice. Ah yes
creations-chat 2021-07-11 13:29:44 No, big builds are what i avoid. My scaling has and always will be: 6 ft tall person will be either 3 or 4 blocks tall

creations-chat 2021-07-11 14:07:26 Maybe you are getting dislikes because it looks like a 2 year old tried to build something
creations-chat 2021-07-11 14:09:32 And also the fact that you built sonething from what looks like a toddlers show, how much more proof do we need that you are unde

creations-chat 2021-07-11 14:43:13 I just downvote almost everything cuz almost everything is trash here. Very few meet my standards
creations-chat 2021-07-11 14:48:15 I just have high standards
creations-chat 2021-07-11 14:50:51 Pvp version of plane, its not meant to look perfect, just wanted to revisit my old pvp he 162. Its a big improvement from the 2 year old plane
creations-chat 2021-07-11 14:52:55 This version is for looks, prob barely gonna fly https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/686788994507210766/822487663368994826/unknown.png
creations-chat 2021-07-11 14:55:15 False, just isnt gonna happen guy. Only people who are well known and very liked get into hof
creations-chat 2021-07-11 15:00:27 Holes in wings <:OmegaTroll:626841385118597152>
creations-chat 2021-07-11 15:03:57 This is why i will never get hof, even if i made the best build pcc has ever seen, i am very disliked, because people still see me as a mass downvoter
creations-chat 2021-07-11 15:05:57 Im going to delay the bv 238 for another year just to anger you <:OmegaTroll:626841385118597152> oh wait thats guggi that is angry avout that
creations-chat 2021-07-11 15:08:56 I wanna finish it but i also wanna make it hover engine powered, that is why its taking so long
creations-chat 2021-07-11 15:10:57 I just need more parts, as soon as we get a ball joint the 238 will be finished so quick.     Nyan thats the he162 ur thinking of.      Better be a good one, if its not i will berate you. The 262 fusulage is something i dont even want to attempt
creations-chat 2021-07-11 15:13:43 Look up what a bv238 is.    Kokamzy, thereason is so you have it look as realistic as possible
creations-chat 2021-07-11 15:15:47 That would be possible sir, if the new people werent such entitled brats, i usually give someone respect until they are an ass, and when a new player thinks they can just insult older players without even having a build posted, they are gonna get stomped
creations-chat 2021-07-11 15:17:53 To my knowledge, i have the biggest bv 238 in plane crazy, there is an old picture with hars, guggi, scot, and a few others with my bv in it.    Dude, jrblack, all i did was downvote a build i didnt think looked good, if he wants feedback he can ask
creations-chat 2021-07-11 15:22:50 What a shitty move, almost as bad as saying "looks unfinished" to a wip build
creations-chat 2021-07-11 16:21:09 Wings
creations-chat 2021-07-11 16:23:11 I pixel measured my 162, and ur wings are too long, you do pixel measurements and you will see
creations-chat 2021-07-11 16:26:44 Basically, take a blueprint, make a part fir the plane, for example the cockpit, take the pixel length of the blueprint cockpit(we will say 40 pixels) if ur cocpit is 2 blocks long then you take 40÷2 and you get your pixel for block scale
creations-chat 2021-07-11 16:33:13 Its basic math...... are you saying thats too complicated?....
creations-chat 2021-07-11 16:39:13 Heres something to consider: *most of those whitebames dont ask for feedback. And the bullying you are talking about is literally just a build getting downvoted*. For me, it goes like this: if its shit ill downvote it, if they dont ask for feedback, i dont give it, if they ask ill give feedback
creations-chat 2021-07-11 16:43:14 Bruh shush, your basically a whitename yourself (trolls)
creations-chat 2021-07-11 16:45:44 Ill give you one guess
creations-chat 2021-07-11 16:48:15 Yes, when a singke block gets posted. Happens more often than you would think
creations-chat 2021-07-11 16:50:16 That too
creations-chat 2021-07-11 16:52:18 You flying a paper airplane? Look at those wings.     Dude your wings are paper thin
creations-chat 2021-07-11 17:40:56 I should do that with some of my builds to see the mess
creations-chat 2021-07-11 17:42:58 WHAT WHAT WHAT HOW HE thought u left

creations-chat 2021-07-11 18:08:37 Make it not neon
creations-chat 2021-07-11 18:31:03 Better
creations-chat 2021-07-11 18:33:09 You can raise the blue number by 10 and see how that looks <@345527706340818944>
creations-chat 2021-07-11 18:36:24 The blue that guy suggested was good just raise the blue by 10.    Put it on the plane so i can see
creations-chat 2021-07-11 18:53:45 Agree
creations-chat 2021-07-11 18:55:47 Intake, nose, area behind cockpit, underside of thevplane
creations-chat 2021-07-11 19:56:59 It stinky
creations-chat 2021-07-11 20:10:08 Bruh and you said an unfinished ship of yours could get hof, you cant even find the different between exhaust snd intake. Also plane looks rlly stinky. Show then
creations-chat 2021-07-14 04:11:49 If thats rlly what you think then you will never get to hof with any build
creations-chat 2021-07-16 06:51:05 Me when, i see that hideous monstrocity of a build: :( and then everyone says its a good build when its super ugly: :(
creations-chat 2021-07-16 06:54:06 Put all his effort into the nose, and forgot that planes are supposed to thin out at the tail
creations-chat 2021-07-16 06:57:22 I literally havent finished a single build. I made a new he 162. And didnt paint it <:FineTroll:626841259746656289>

creations-chat 2021-07-16 07:03:26 It is, it literally has anorexia, but atleast it doesnt woble as much as the last version https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/686788994507210766/855338756533911592/unknown.png
creations-chat 2021-07-16 07:09:00 Tiny engine
creations-chat 2021-07-16 07:11:40 No you should make the engine bigger, also make it not a square
creations-chat 2021-07-16 07:16:16 Bruh, your plane looks nothing like tgat, yours is too skinny, that thing looks like a rocket, your nose is too pointy, make it more rounded out. And are those wings made of paper. And your cockpit, its too low
creations-chat 2021-07-16 10:35:02 Wdym
creations-chat 2021-07-16 10:38:37 Oh well, atleast it actually looks like the plane its modeled after unlike most builds here <:FineTroll:626841259746656289> all i have to do is just outspeed tgem
creations-chat 2021-07-16 10:41:35 Its a pure boom and zoom build, very fast dive speed due to weight
creations-chat 2021-07-16 12:15:24 Forgot to say this earlier, there isnt much point in me posting here, a lot of people dont like me cuz i downvote their builds, so i will most likely get downvote bombed
creations-chat 2021-07-16 12:18:49 Yeah, most of the people who have decent builds in here are fine with me, its just the people who dont have good builds that really dont like me
creations-chat 2021-07-16 12:20:59 Yeah. Idk, maybe ill paint up that 162 and just post it
creations-chat 2021-07-16 12:23:01 And then maybe finish my aluette, bv238, he111, spacecraft...... yeah theres a lot of things

creations-chat 2021-10-14 17:19:06 In this server looks are everything, again, we cant judge on anything else when you only give a picture
creations-chat 2021-10-14 17:21:07 Does it fly using the wings or is it just rockets or hovers
creations-chat 2021-10-14 17:23:26 Nah bruh when im done im making that thing fly with the wings, i cant take that kind of disapointment
creations-chat 2021-10-14 17:27:31 <@434710676154613770> actually, i need some info first. Just how many blocks do you think a wing is
creations-chat 2021-10-14 17:29:32 Uh actually im at work. So its gonna have to wait until a few more hours. But ill tell you after work
creations-chat 2021-10-14 17:32:02 I mean, it is lunch break rn...
creations-chat 2021-10-14 17:34:42 I have it at any time between 12 and 1 but we only take 30 mins. Also work kinda slow around these hours since nobody buys things here when they at work themselves
creations-chat 2021-10-14 17:36:44 Yeah
creations-chat 2021-10-14 17:42:55 You literally didn't use a single motor to make the plane look better
creations-chat 2021-10-14 19:48:00 Idk post it so we can see it, instead of massive glare. You might as well have just posted the shadow and said "fEeDbAcK?"

creations-chat 2021-10-14 19:54:48 <@760578875163410432>  body of the truck is way too long,  wheels are too small for that chassis, its all black, no real detail
creations-chat 2021-10-14 20:09:16 This conversation that just happened, i feel like it sums up the average iq in pcc
creations-chat 2021-10-14 20:11:17 Yeah pretty much
creations-chat 2021-10-14 20:45:43 Ok, the single block creations are not funny anymore, only the original was.   You guys prob werent around for the original

creations-chat 2021-10-27 17:04:17 Make the hovers internally
creations-chat 2021-10-27 17:06:26 Make it like a shaft going inside the heli, and have the hovers rotate inside a hollow cylinder.   Called a hover engine instead of a hover drive
creations-chat 2021-10-27 17:08:35 Still looks like shit.   Internal hovers looks better too
creations-chat 2021-10-27 17:14:05 Hover drive: pushes off of motor or piston or spring to move you forward. 
Hiver engine: a shaft with hover engines on it to spin the shaft, pushes off the walls, usually enclosed within the vehicle, works best inside a hollowed out cylinder

the-dump 2021-10-30 00:00:31 ok
creations-chat 2021-11-03 13:12:52 This is the outcome of someone who cant think ahead, they only try to fix a tiny problem and then cause a larger problem. Also looks like they trying to motorlock to impress. Which they have failed at miserably
creations-chat 2021-11-03 13:14:52 No exposed motorlock cuz this has no detailwork, the fusulage is literally a square
creations-chat 2021-11-03 17:10:23 Too wide
creations-chat 2021-11-04 14:25:05 A-10, any comercial airliner, any mig
creations-chat 2021-11-05 17:38:43 Its all the same color
creations-chat 2021-11-05 17:56:16 The main bodywork, its all a dark shade that makes it have no highlights due to roblox lighting. (Meaning you cant see tge detailwork so it kinda just looks like a solid black mass) you can make artificial highlights with different shades
creations-chat 2021-11-05 17:59:15 Add a very slight blue tint to the black.  Add highlights
creations-chat 2021-11-06 17:40:08 do i really need to explain? like do you seriously not know why i downvoted?
creations-chat 2021-11-06 17:43:36 the wheels look ass, i dont even know what kinda design you were attempting to make but it looks garbage, the hull looks like the base of a blender and then you put some shiny batteries on it, the undercarriage looks like you literally put like 2 minutes in it max, and the entire build overall is very monotonous and very bland
creations-chat 2021-11-06 17:46:12 no joke ur hull literally looking like a flattened version of this <@456226577798135808> theres ur feedback
creations-chat 2021-11-06 17:49:03 still cant believe solee blocked me from downvoting him cuz he cant cope with a red arrow.   look at all their recent build, notice how none of them have a downvote from me. it literally wont lemme downvote them, even tho i hate them so much.
creations-chat 2021-11-06 17:52:13 ye they blocked me
creations-chat 2021-11-06 20:26:51 they not good.    doesnt add side detail, colors are very monotonous, like his ships are literally the same color with no highlights so it literally just looks like a grey blob

creations-chat 2021-12-23 16:00:47 Bro..... you dont need wishbone suspension..... i hate you so much for this...... why did you do it
creations-chat 2021-12-23 16:04:26 Listen man.... theres a line you dont cross when going for realism, and you flew past that line. That line is when your uhh "realism" makes your build look like a pile of shit
creations-chat 2021-12-23 16:06:27 Just dont make it have suspension like that, its damn near the dumbest thing i think ive seen in this shithole
creations-chat 2021-12-23 16:12:20 Goddamn u a dumbass, i know planes have suspension. Im pretty sure most people do, but guess what, they usually dont have DOUBLE WISHBONE THAT NEARLY TOUCHES THE GROUND AND MAKES IT LOOK LIKE A 5 YEAR OLD WITH A WELDER FOUND A BUNCH OF PIPES AND PUT THEM ON UR PLANE
creations-chat 2021-12-23 16:14:41 Wow, really? Who could have thought. Goddamn average iq in this server be hitting rock bottom fr
creations-chat 2021-12-23 16:16:44 Nice prop bro, really looks like it will be able to pull that fatass plane
creations-chat 2021-12-23 16:19:31 And the landing gear
creations-chat 2021-12-23 16:27:29 Bro i cant fucking deal with this. Its like trying to deal with children who think they are funny and know everything. And you just have to sit there cuz it takes to long to explain it to them cuz they dumb as rocks
creations-chat 2021-12-23 16:29:29 You alone bring the average iq down by 4
creations-chat 2021-12-23 16:32:33 Literally proving my point. 2 unironic your mother jokes as a response
creations-chat 2021-12-23 16:35:40 I envy the people that have had the chance to never encounter you.      You are the sole reason the netherlands have to build dikes to keep out water, stay out of the ocean
creations-chat 2021-12-23 16:39:37 Not you.......
creations-chat 2021-12-23 16:57:27 Look in creations
creations-chat 2021-12-23 17:00:55 Stop
creations-chat 2021-12-23 17:03:48 And what are ypu going to do about it?
creations-chat 2021-12-23 17:06:12 Ok? So you are gonna get butthurt or something because i called some shitty builds shit?
creations-chat 2021-12-23 17:08:18 Really, cuz thats exactly what you are doing rn "most toxic person in this community" if you cant take some critisizm then dont ask me to tell you whats wrong with your build
creations-chat 2021-12-23 17:10:20 Oh yeah lemme just go back through my messages so i can find exactly what i said instead of shortening it.  No you dumbass.      Bruh, josh, it doesnt take a college degree to figure out i wasnt talking about you
creations-chat 2021-12-23 17:16:49 Wdym nobody asks me... nobody asks me anymore cuz theres too much stuff to downvote so i just dont anymore. And i dont tell people how to fix it? Wdym i do tell them how
creations-chat 2021-12-23 17:19:44 I didnt delete messages it got deleted for "spamming" cuz i put too many spaces in an edit. Wdym cope? That literally doesnt make any sense
creations-chat 2021-12-23 17:23:09 Just a slightly annoying thing. Says original creator is herr, is funny i think, even after he said it wasnt him
creations-chat 2021-12-23 17:25:10 I didnt even say anything against you. I literally just said that it was annoying people are still crediting herr even when he said it wasnt him

creations-chat 2022-03-24 13:24:16 Where.    What plane is it supposed to be
creations-chat 2022-03-24 13:26:24 Why is it so.... plain. Like there is absolutely 0 weathering
creations-chat 2022-03-24 13:28:25 If its a wip then why did u paint it.        Why is it a mistake.    You dont paint as you go, everything is subject to change so painting while building is a waste
creations-chat 2022-03-24 13:36:42 Or just, paint it after because thats easier and doesnt waste time?      If there is clipping then u just paint it the same color.   Its that simple
creations-chat 2022-03-24 13:38:43 Jealous of what? What are you even talking about.     Exactly bq_nk, one of the few times ive seen you not agree with the other person
creations-chat 2022-03-24 13:41:22 Just a waste of time....
creations-chat 2022-03-24 13:43:28 Literally all i said was, why is it painted if its a wip, and then you guys ripped on me
creations-chat 2022-03-24 13:45:29 Of what tho
creations-chat 2022-03-24 13:51:09 Great, alxti is here
creations-chat 2022-03-24 13:59:40 No, you are only just realising how dumb they have been all along
creations-chat 2022-03-24 14:18:20 Add weathering, mud, scuffs, shading. Looks too clean to be an offroad vehicle
creations-chat 2022-03-24 14:24:13 Post it here when u finish the weathering
creations-chat 2022-03-24 15:44:45 How's the progress on it

creations-chat 2022-04-04 20:10:20 <@626449107577471012> fix the holes in ur wings
creations-chat 2022-04-04 20:21:53 You could use them, it just doesnt look as good.    He can hide them already, he just needs to motorlock a half block into the motor so you can't see it anymore
creations-chat 2022-04-04 20:24:54 <@626449107577471012> basically, the flush wing won't hinder flight performance, in my experience it doesn't get jammed

creations-chat 2022-04-05 14:24:18 <@918581321004089364> i want you to tell me..... what you used to measure that out...... because that is not correct at all........
creations-chat 2022-04-05 14:28:06 Listen dude, i want you to just quickly look at a blueprint, and use a pixel measuring tool..... ive made a p47 before, that was one of my first builds, and guess what,  even that looked more correctly built
creations-chat 2022-04-05 14:30:12 Can you put it up to a side profile?
creations-chat 2022-04-05 14:32:16 Its so misproportionate....

creations-chat 2022-04-06 17:13:39 Agree
creations-chat 2022-04-06 20:22:31 What's even harder to find is a build upvoted by me

creations-chat 2022-04-07 14:13:53 Wdym nothing is wrong.....  i want you to go pull up a blueprint and put it next to your tank.  Look up blueprint, post it here, post a picture of the side of your tank
creations-chat 2022-04-07 14:18:40 You notice anything now?  Thats one.  Maybe about how FUCKING TALL YOU MADE IT?
creations-chat 2022-04-07 14:23:44 Yeah something wrong
creations-chat 2022-04-07 14:25:30 IT GETS WORSE. I DIDN'T THINK IT COULD GET WORSE.  THE FRONT IS FLAT BRO.   Bro you are actually slow, i meant there is 0 fucking detail or armor plating overlaps

contest-chat 2022-04-19 12:22:51 Cuz the paris class frigate is in second, and i hate the shape and paint on that one too
contest-chat 2022-04-19 12:23:10 But i think it's better than the white cinder block
bot-central 2022-04-19 12:23:56 -contesttop
contest-chat 2022-04-19 12:31:12 <@297120728342331392> honestly i rlly like the ship, it could use a few fixes here and there, but what really ruins it is the paint
bot-central 2022-04-19 12:32:08 Thx
bot-central 2022-04-19 12:32:18 Indeed
bot-central 2022-04-19 12:33:42 True
bot-central 2022-04-19 12:34:03 1st place is literally a white brick with a mid interior
bot-central 2022-04-19 12:34:24 Second place is a black pile of bricks with no interior
bot-central 2022-04-19 12:34:49 They are a good idea, people just cant build
bot-central 2022-04-19 12:35:21 Honestly tho i like <@297120728342331392> build, the paint is just bad
bot-central 2022-04-19 12:35:45 But its actually really nice looking for the most part

contest-chat 2022-04-20 01:34:17 hm
contest-chat 2022-04-20 01:34:34 i wonder what could possibly be happening 🤔
contest-chat 2022-04-20 01:36:57 <@335599526414909451> contest ended my guy, ur a bit late tho, since it was meant to end about 25 mins ago
contest-chat 2022-04-20 01:37:16 yeah
contest-chat 2022-04-20 01:37:38 nice
bot-central 2022-04-20 01:39:42 yeah idk what they doing
bot-central 2022-04-20 01:43:26 -contesttop
contest-chat 2022-04-20 02:14:29 nothing is happening tho...
contest-chat 2022-04-20 02:14:52 yes, but its odd its taking this long
contest-chat 2022-04-20 02:15:03 usually its within like 30 mins at max
contest-chat 2022-04-20 02:15:20 u sure?
contest-chat 2022-04-20 02:15:29 maybe
contest-chat 2022-04-20 02:15:51 hmmm
contest-chat 2022-04-20 02:18:50 yeah
contest-chat 2022-04-20 02:19:05 the shitbrick didnt even look good.... why did he want that to get in....
contest-chat 2022-04-20 02:19:56 perhaps
contest-chat 2022-04-20 04:55:01 Ur right, its a detailed interior burrito, sorry
contest-chat 2022-04-20 04:56:27 Also i know this, i just think he could have chosen much better looking ships to build, i mean the thing its from has so many different ships
contest-chat 2022-04-20 04:58:06 That thing is not detailed on the outside
contest-chat 2022-04-20 04:58:30 Also why you argueing about this, the contest is over
contest-chat 2022-04-20 04:59:50 Its also like 6x bigger than my ship.... its kinda hard to get more detailed when ur ship is that much smaller...
contest-chat 2022-04-20 05:02:03 Idk what you really expected out of it, its a medium size fighter with 90% motorlock, it would be physically impossible to fit an interior in that thing
contest-chat 2022-04-20 05:02:48 I didnt want to make a big ship.... i had a vacation right in the mid of the contest so i had only a few days to actually build
contest-chat 2022-04-20 05:04:57 And going back to the point you made with the "50 motorlock angles" for my specific plane, i did need that many to make it look like its supposed to, otherwise i wouldn't have used all them
contest-chat 2022-04-20 05:06:00 What i would have done was add a bit of paint detail, even if its just slight it makes it not look like a matte finish, it makes it looks more real
contest-chat 2022-04-20 05:07:15 I understand that the ship you were basing it on was already blocky, but yours just kind of made it look more angular
contest-chat 2022-04-20 05:08:51 Idk these are just my suggestions, i dont rlly care what you do, its just my opinion
contest-chat 2022-04-20 05:09:12 I would still do paint weathering tho
contest-chat 2022-04-20 05:09:34 I never said that though...
contest-chat 2022-04-20 05:10:11 Painting is everything
contest-chat 2022-04-20 05:10:29 I should have had more paint colors on my red
contest-chat 2022-04-20 05:11:11 Then why are you argueing, we focus on different things
contest-chat 2022-04-20 05:11:20 Me, exterior, you, interior
contest-chat 2022-04-20 05:12:32 Which is why i said i didnt like it, you shouldnt take it so seriously, im just some other person competing in a competition
contest-chat 2022-04-20 05:12:51 However
contest-chat 2022-04-20 05:13:01 There is a ship built by you that i saw
contest-chat 2022-04-20 05:13:06 I cant remember it
contest-chat 2022-04-20 05:13:15 Kinda looked like an axe blade
contest-chat 2022-04-20 05:14:05 Yeah, i liked that ones exterior
contest-chat 2022-04-20 05:14:24 That one was good, except for the lack of paint weathering of course
contest-chat 2022-04-20 05:15:24 It was just my opinion, of course it was an over exaggeration, if you wanna see a real shit brick go to a public pvp server
contest-chat 2022-04-20 05:16:28 I dont get why you guys are so upset about this
contest-chat 2022-04-20 05:18:22 I suppose that's because you dont know me all that well, i just say dumb shit all the time with no real meaning
contest-chat 2022-04-20 05:19:14 Btw, anybody know if puri is ever gonna announce winners
contest-chat 2022-04-20 05:19:47 Puri is the one who runs the contest with rbk
contest-chat 2022-04-20 05:19:57 He usually announces the winners
contest-chat 2022-04-20 05:20:05 He did end it
contest-chat 2022-04-20 05:20:14 He just hasn't announced who won yet
contest-chat 2022-04-20 05:20:23 I suppose
contest-chat 2022-04-20 05:34:44 Idk, contest stress maybe
contest-chat 2022-04-20 05:34:55 But you weren't competing so idk
contest-chat 2022-04-20 05:35:55 I seriously dont know what i did to offend you guys specifically, i could understand exqusyte being offended but idk what i did to you
contest-chat 2022-04-20 05:37:29 I dont think ive been a shithead to you in the past
contest-chat 2022-04-20 05:37:33 Lemme check
contest-chat 2022-04-20 05:38:21 No, this convo was the only one where i mentioned you
contest-chat 2022-04-20 05:38:55 I never did that
contest-chat 2022-04-20 05:39:22 Ok
contest-chat 2022-04-20 05:39:24 Fair

events-chat 2022-05-02 22:47:02 <@466793357318815744> how big is smeeeeee, cuz if i make mine too big compared to the rest of the competition then i just do absolutely nothing
events-chat 2022-05-02 23:23:45 ok but like
events-chat 2022-05-02 23:24:02 how wide
events-chat 2022-05-02 23:24:31 ok
events-chat 2022-05-02 23:25:11 i cant actually make the front slope be 45 degrees
events-chat 2022-05-02 23:25:51 1, i am lazy.
2, spinner wont fit
events-chat 2022-05-02 23:43:35 if im gonna do that, then i need to layer blocks
events-chat 2022-05-02 23:43:53 thats what im doing
events-chat 2022-05-02 23:54:49 why dont people just stick with the one they got
events-chat 2022-05-02 23:55:46 what is huge
events-chat 2022-05-02 23:56:20 wdym i saw that one
events-chat 2022-05-02 23:57:06 why would they tho, that one looks way easier than something like smeeeeee
events-chat 2022-05-02 23:57:24 with smee, every single link is a weakpoint just waiting to be severed
events-chat 2022-05-02 23:58:03 the links are annoying, they dont work properly here
events-chat 2022-05-03 00:08:35 (isnt heavy enough)
events-chat 2022-05-03 00:09:04 smee is not gonna have this problem (it is an ankle biter that will take off wheels
events-chat 2022-05-03 00:09:58 theres a lot i want to do with it but i dont want to overcomplicate
events-chat 2022-05-03 00:47:56 <@466793357318815744> allow me to use 16 cutters instead of 15, makes it more symetrical
events-chat 2022-05-03 00:48:17 amaze
events-chat 2022-05-03 01:39:49 <@466793357318815744> smee lives
events-chat 2022-05-03 01:40:07 
events-chat 2022-05-03 01:51:13 now time to encase everything'
events-chat 2022-05-03 01:51:37 <@466793357318815744> hey whats the rules for flinging people, because smee just happens to do that
events-chat 2022-05-03 01:54:38 ok
events-chat 2022-05-03 02:29:30 
events-chat 2022-05-03 02:39:56 840 blocks
events-chat 2022-05-03 02:40:13 minimum armor
events-chat 2022-05-03 12:08:22 U vs smee in that first test
creations-chat 2022-05-03 12:29:45 Waddle dee
events-chat 2022-05-03 12:40:29 Trust me is already fixed
events-chat 2022-05-03 12:40:48 He faced my prototype smee and got flung over rails
events-chat 2022-05-03 13:50:25 Not for long, now i get to add the actual exterior to it
events-chat 2022-05-03 13:50:49 Which means its much stronger
events-chat 2022-05-03 13:57:56 <@466793357318815744> you don't care if i make it so smee has 4 wheels on each side do you? Cuz when it gets cut in half it doesn't work
events-chat 2022-05-03 14:01:51 Perhaps
events-chat 2022-05-03 14:02:18 Im gonna have seperate controls for it when it breaks cuz thats easier
events-chat 2022-05-03 14:06:18 Amaze
events-chat 2022-05-03 14:08:09 Its prob only gonna be 3 wheels cuz the spinner takes up so much space
events-chat 2022-05-03 14:08:25 Incredulous, i know.
contest-chat 2022-05-03 14:10:31 Stupid fucking rat

creations-chat 2022-05-04 14:27:48 <@743296813276200971> that is most definitely a tutorial man
creations-chat 2022-05-04 14:29:47 Looks like a tutorial to me, idk what to say
events-chat 2022-05-04 16:11:49 Unnecessary
events-chat 2022-05-04 16:13:17 Red devil is good tho
events-chat 2022-05-04 16:13:33 And saws do work... smee has 2 saws...
events-chat 2022-05-04 16:13:59 Indeed
events-chat 2022-05-04 16:14:26 Yeah idk why you wouldn't want
events-chat 2022-05-04 16:14:43 You should have just said no rerolls
events-chat 2022-05-04 16:15:59 It does
events-chat 2022-05-04 16:16:28 It does, look at the ends of the bot
events-chat 2022-05-04 16:16:59 They work the same in pc
events-chat 2022-05-04 16:18:41 Wdym how...
events-chat 2022-05-04 16:19:05 What is the difference in plane crazy. 
Go ahead and explain
events-chat 2022-05-04 16:19:29 <@801256789529722910>
events-chat 2022-05-04 16:21:07 Yes. In the real world, they work differently, but in plane crazy, what would be different
events-chat 2022-05-04 16:21:55 Also, that disc works like a saw, you can see that only the edge is sharpened, so it doesn't even work like most discs
events-chat 2022-05-04 16:22:32 I dont fucking know what that is
events-chat 2022-05-04 16:23:08 You still have not answered my question, how is it any different in plane crazy
events-chat 2022-05-04 16:23:55 Because a cutter in plane crazy will cut.... like a saw....
events-chat 2022-05-04 16:24:28 It doesn't work like that in plane crazy at all
events-chat 2022-05-04 16:24:51 Maybe the bar
events-chat 2022-05-04 16:25:14 Have you ever played plane crazy to realize how the physics work?
events-chat 2022-05-04 16:26:35 They work the same in plane crazy
events-chat 2022-05-04 16:26:59 Cutters
events-chat 2022-05-04 16:28:53 The cutters will cut like a saw will just the same
events-chat 2022-05-04 16:29:43 Have you ever played plane crazy
events-chat 2022-05-04 16:30:05 <@466793357318815744> i don't think they understand how the cutters work
events-chat 2022-05-04 18:03:53 Smee will fling him
events-chat 2022-05-04 18:04:18 Smeee loves flinging shit
events-chat 2022-05-04 19:02:28 I thought it was rlly easy to fight
events-chat 2022-05-04 19:03:06 Then again i did just launch him into space the last 3 times

events-chat 2022-05-06 04:42:43 yes
events-chat 2022-05-06 11:59:29 You get assigned a bot to build
events-chat 2022-05-06 12:00:10 He clearly did not read the event rules
events-chat 2022-05-06 12:00:50 And you have to make it as accurate the the irl bot as possible
events-chat 2022-05-06 12:07:36 What
events-chat 2022-05-06 12:08:41 Doubles the speed, halves the power
events-chat 2022-05-06 12:54:37 That's not how the motor stacking in plane crazy works
events-chat 2022-05-06 12:54:58 If you have 2 motors on top of eachother, both have 10 totque
events-chat 2022-05-06 12:55:17 That means that your top speed will double
events-chat 2022-05-06 12:55:47 But your torque will actually be half
events-chat 2022-05-06 14:26:41 Mine can still fling
contest-chat 2022-05-06 14:28:53 Never
events-chat 2022-05-06 15:42:51 Cant

events-chat 2022-05-06 17:45:50 Well yeah, it will still get up to speed, just once you hit anything it will stop dead
events-chat 2022-05-06 17:46:20 That's not an ironically moment
events-chat 2022-05-06 17:55:02 When you say power, are you talking about torque

events-chat 2022-05-06 17:56:26 No response
events-chat 2022-05-06 17:58:27 Drums are gonna be some of the worst performing bots because the whole energy transfer thing doesn't work with roblox latancy
events-chat 2022-05-06 17:59:40 And spinning faster does not= better, it just means that it takes longer to spin up after each weak hit

help 2022-05-10 12:41:53 Mans really needed to draw out a blueprint for plane crazy

help 2022-05-10 12:42:34 Why did you make it 4.4
help 2022-05-10 12:42:45 That's just a terrible scale
creations-chat 2022-05-10 12:44:47 People just post their shit builds and say "downvote this creation" after realizing people don't like their build so it makes them feel better
creations-chat 2022-05-10 12:48:28 The better childhood tbh
creations-chat 2022-05-10 12:50:33 If you grew up with gundoms and evangelion then you had no friends
creations-chat 2022-05-10 12:55:05 Its pretty decent for what it's going for, i mean i feel it's l lacking detail, but it looks like it can take a bit unlike all the other mechs you see
creations-chat 2022-05-10 12:56:47 I mostly meant exterior detail,
creations-chat 2022-05-10 12:58:29 Maybe its the joints for me, with how thin they are
creations-chat 2022-05-10 13:01:18 Nah i can't play right now anyway
creations-chat 2022-05-10 14:07:40 That is very little text

events-chat 2022-05-11 11:53:29 So true
creations-chat 2022-05-11 12:14:35 I would post my spaceship in creations, but i feel like that's kinda cheap
events-chat 2022-05-11 17:56:43 I think i know
creations-chat 2022-05-12 12:28:50 A month? That's it?
creations-chat 2022-05-12 12:31:48 I have a 6k build that is the only of its kind in this server that hasn't been touched for 2 years.
So like i said, only a month?
creations-chat 2022-05-12 12:34:14 That's the point.... i was saying that a month isn't that long... how do you not understand this lo
creations-chat 2022-05-12 12:36:10 Using the term "solid month" does not mean exactly a month, it is meant to imply the importance of the duration of time. 
So im sure you can see the confusion, when you say that you meant it wasn't that long
creations-chat 2022-05-12 12:38:14 You just misused "solid month" that's all
creations-chat 2022-05-12 12:40:13 So true

events-chat 2022-05-14 19:18:56 a complete moron, a bumbling idiot

events-chat 2022-05-14 19:20:36 he literally adds nothing to the community other than another no name person who's mother must have been a heavy drinker and smoker while he was a fetus
events-chat 2022-05-14 19:21:51 makes sense
events-chat 2022-05-14 19:22:11 like i said, his mother must have been a heavy alchoholic and smoker when he was a fetus

events-chat 2022-05-16 01:21:06 no joke?
on god?
for real?
events-chat 2022-05-16 14:15:09 <@466793357318815744> wait if the guy was cheating then what happens with the tournament
events-chat 2022-05-16 14:17:26 Also i find if quite funny that both people who were absolutely obsessed with battlebots were the ones who were cheating and got disqualified
events-chat 2022-05-16 14:19:08 What about my fight with him
events-chat 2022-05-16 14:19:25 Also what was he doing for cheating
events-chat 2022-05-16 14:19:46 The first fight on day 2 was me vs the cheater
events-chat 2022-05-16 14:24:40 I dont see what he did since hec was banned and all his messages are gone
events-chat 2022-05-16 14:27:25 How did he cheat
events-chat 2022-05-16 14:27:55 Extra balast? Higher torque and speed for motors?
events-chat 2022-05-16 14:28:17 I feel like that's what it was since i got flung so easily
events-chat 2022-05-16 15:58:31 Yeah that makes sense why i got flung and i couldn't fling him
events-chat 2022-05-16 15:59:32 My weakness with flinging was that if i hit a seperate entity like a thing on a motor then it doesn't fling
events-chat 2022-05-16 15:59:47 That's why is so hard to launch huge
events-chat 2022-05-16 17:05:53 Are you going to ignore the higher torque and speed on the spinner?
events-chat 2022-05-16 19:38:11 Strange how a bunch of battlebot nerds show up randomly in pcc just for one event, they cheat, get disqualified, and then complain about how it's not accurate
events-chat 2022-05-16 19:56:42 It was their own choice to participate tho
events-chat 2022-05-16 19:57:08 If they really cared all that much about the rules they wouldnt play
events-chat 2022-05-16 19:58:50 Well i mean, if you are going to join in the event then you accept the rules, thats how that works
events-chat 2022-05-16 19:59:08 Jrst cheated.... he didn't even win fair
events-chat 2022-05-16 19:59:37 Everyone else was fine with them, it was like 3 people that cared
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:00:33 Just seems kinda silly to me that you would join an event and not even look at the rules, and then say the rules are bad when you break them
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:00:57 Again, everyone else didnt care
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:01:25 The among us guy actually admitted to not even reading them
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:02:01 
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:02:17 This guy
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:02:50 That guy wasn't attack
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:03:07 It was a different guy, who agreed with attack
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:03:46 They act like the same person, that guy got disqualified before the event started tho
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:04:18 No, they arent, they just act like it
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:04:35 Honestly you kinda act the same too
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:05:37 Random swearing even tho the argument isnt all that heated, acting very high and mighty dispite not having any sort of record to back that up
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:06:13 What was it again?
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:07:11 Im not sure, i personally think he didn't, and he just heard the rules through other people, but idk, he might have read them and just chose to ignore them
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:07:43 He cgeated
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:08:27 Wdym? I said if he did read them that he just ignored them
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:08:49 Idk it just seems like he did it on purpose
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:09:31 He got thru multiple battles while using it, i just feel like it would be hard to not notice that
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:10:15 But idk, if it was accidental he would still get disqualified
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:10:40 He tried to rematch me but he got banned before he could
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:11:00 Yousuf to the rescue
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:11:16 Thats what they did didnt they?
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:11:37 I dont have any mutual servers so i can't message him
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:11:54 Otherwise i would rematch him
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:12:24 No? The last chat he sent was us trying to organize a rematcg
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:12:53 Detective yousuf
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:15:08 I would be down for that, i just want someone else there who can check his motor settings, just in case
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:20:15 That just brings up the question why you guys would care so much about this event, i mean we are obviously not going for realism, this is meant to just be a fun little event that wasn't meant to be taken seriously
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:21:33 Yeah but for an event focused on fun battles and building, its decent rules, and the majority agrees
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:22:30 Theres just no need to complain, this isn't like the extremely organized events you guys talk about
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:22:50 It was just a for fun evenr
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:23:54 Ah yes that was another thing i wanted to touch on, you guys obly complained about the rules **after** a few got disqualified or their ideas got shot down
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:24:47 Yes
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:25:08 Weve done events in the past and nobody cared
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:25:39 And these rules were better than previous events
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:25:55 Was that on the first day?
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:26:10 Idk nobody complained about them
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:26:31 Idk about stuff that happened on day 1. 
So i won't say anything
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:28:37 What bonus did it get?
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:29:09 Wait what was the bot?
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:29:32 Can you send an image?
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:30:51 Oh, idk it was most likely because its a horizontal spinner but it weighs half the bot, it has a 50/50 chance of killing itself or the enemy
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:31:33 Idk then
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:32:13 But that wasn't what the original debate was about anyway
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:32:56 You guys just took this event too seriously
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:34:01 That's not the part I'm talking about
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:34:26 Im talking about complaining about the rules
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:36:18 I do agree with you on that, its very un honorable fight if my enemy suddenly weighs as much as all of new york
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:36:37 Thats what happened with me vs attack tho
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:37:18 Im not saying you are wrong about that
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:40:30 1st: it was listed in previous battlebot tournaments so people just assumed it didnt need to be mentioned 
2nd:Just made the fights less entertaining, upwards spinning vertical spinners were suddenly at a major disadvantage due to the main point of their weapon being null
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:41:40 Its more fun to see a bot fly across the arena than see 2 bots basically stat planted like a f1 car
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:42:03 It wasn't allowed in previous ones
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:42:34 He goof
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:44:35 <@466793357318815744> i do have idea for next tournament tho, a ship battle, but your weapon is a tnt cannon (i have several semi auto designs that would be perfect for this)
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:45:00 Amaze
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:46:04 Dont worry, ammo storage is modular
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:46:36 You can make it massive, you would be more likely to have the battle last hours than run out of ammo
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:47:18 A standardized gun and ammo storage would be needed, which i can supply
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:47:42 Agree
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:49:16 2 types of ship battles im thinking of
1: modern battleship kind of cannons
2: pirate ship cannons
(Would finally encourage me to build the flying dutchman i promised tooti)
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:50:17 I personally prefer the pirate ship idea (broadsiding monkeys)

creations-chat 2022-05-18 23:34:24 the 109
creations-chat 2022-05-18 23:36:18 time spent on a project does not equal upvotes or apreciation, how your build looks will dictate how your build fares in creations, and unfortunately, yours just kind of looks like every single other airliner in pcc. it doesnt have anything special going for it
creations-chat 2022-05-18 23:38:43 if it did have an effect on upvotes then anything i post from here on out would get 200+ upvotes every time because i havent had a single new idea since 2020
creations-chat 2022-05-18 23:40:37 that is a 109 correct?
are you in vip 1 rn?

creations-chat 2022-05-26 20:34:01 MAGNETTTT????
Wtf why would you magnet lock it
What even is magnet locking
creations-chat 2022-05-26 20:37:05 Ok so its just motor angled trails with more steps
creations-chat 2022-05-26 20:39:18 Show close up of the nose
creations-chat 2022-05-26 20:41:28 Im trying to figure out what you made the nose out of.  
It doesn't quite look like trails but i don't know that else is would be
creations-chat 2022-05-26 20:44:10 <@719168864705052802> are you able to tell what the nose is made of? Im on phone so i can't tell
creations-chat 2022-05-26 20:47:27 I thought it was trails at first but the longer i look the more it seems like half wedges
creations-chat 2022-05-26 20:49:30 Did he use my trail method with half wedges???? Absurdity !
creations-chat 2022-05-26 20:52:23 Because he aaid its as accurate as it can get. And his cockpit is hilariously too small
creations-chat 2022-05-26 20:55:22 <@718409831639154718> what he did is essentially what i did with that he 162 tail i made a while ago but he used half wedges
creations-chat 2022-05-26 20:57:24 Also i think ive figured out what the hell he means by magnet locking
Ill have to test this out, i mean i knew they could do something like this but i just never thought of using it to hide motors instead
creations-chat 2022-05-26 20:59:25 No its too perfect to be that, if you did that you would see much more imperfection. 
I will explain once i get home and experiment to make sure im right
creations-chat 2022-05-26 21:01:44 Yes im fairly confident i know how he did it now.
Just been thinking it over in my head and its a miracle nobody had thought of this before, its so simple
creations-chat 2022-05-26 21:03:47 (Smoke pipes) the front and back isn't glass
Only the middle part isnt glass
creations-chat 2022-05-26 21:05:54 Only the middle one is glass monkey
creations-chat 2022-05-26 21:08:55 Ok i think i have an explanation for his "magnet locking" so basically you angle all the parts in build modecthen use weld on a magnet to anchor the angled parts to the plane, then you disconnect the motors <@770764150048948224> correct me if im wrong.
Epic, didn't even have to experiment
creations-chat 2022-05-26 21:13:37 That's exactly it
Yeah tooty, that's about right
creations-chat 2022-05-26 21:15:38 I thought you meant something different, sorry
creations-chat 2022-05-26 21:18:18 Im not sure how i havent thought of this before, most likely because magnets are unstable, but i will surely be incorperating this into my arsenal of vuild techniques, though this will probably be more niche
creations-chat 2022-05-26 21:20:20 I mean i knew they could hold blocks in the air and it would look like it's cam locked, i just never thought of using them like this

creations-chat 2022-05-26 22:20:48 yeah no, if he were to get inventer then i would get inventor for making thin treads
creations-chat 2022-05-26 22:26:19 the magnet locking thing he was talking about is real tho
creations-chat 2022-05-26 22:31:17 that actually kinda looks like a landing gear
creations-chat 2022-05-26 22:53:45 his story doesnt line up, because he said his cockpit was made of 2 wide trails, and then if you look in his build mode image its neither of those, its a cylinder thats not even the right size for the cockpit
creations-chat 2022-05-26 22:57:25 first off: in the build mode pic you can see a bunch of yellow half wedges, those are meant to be his nose, first problem, there arent enough to make a full cone.
second, he has multiple little things sticking out that dont really make a whole lot of sense in plane crazy.
third, the cockpit story is so messy and doesnt line up with any of what he has said or shown,
4th, the tip of the nose would have to be a landing gear wheel for it to be that round, but if you look at the build mode, theres not a single one. 


case closed its not a pc build, he used his old build and modified it during the hour period that he didnt respond to make it look like what he had described for the build mode pic.
creations-chat 2022-05-27 00:07:01 yes
creations-chat 2022-05-27 00:13:32 the nose isnt impossible but i would say the cockpit definitely is
creations-chat 2022-05-27 00:15:35 looks like a fucking heat sink got damn

events-chat 2022-06-10 18:51:52 theres 2 main ideas for the types of ships
events-chat 2022-06-10 18:52:24 we can either have it pirate ship themed, cuz i have a cannon for that, or it can be more modern themed, cuz i also have a cannon for that
events-chat 2022-06-10 18:59:31 the chances of running out of ammo are slim

events-chat 2022-06-10 19:11:48 bad idea, horrible idea even
events-chat 2022-06-10 19:16:55 or you just

thats called a driveshaft.... and an axle.....

creations-chat 2022-07-26 20:34:41 LOOOOOOOO THATS NOT EVEN CLOSE TO HOW A REVERSE GEAR WORKS LOOOOO also theres still no transmission in that one. ok dude i want you to go look up a transmission right now and then come back and apologize for your stupidity
creations-chat 2022-07-26 20:36:42 <@617498718417190943> read this. 
thats not a transmission tho, thats you moving your driveshaft side to side
what you have there is an engine, a clutch, a driveshaft, and 2 axles
creations-chat 2022-07-26 20:39:19 also, my friend made a working pendulum clock with gears with teeth, so gears are possible, you just evidently didnt try hard enough
creations-chat 2022-07-26 20:41:20 forgotten is right, its more similar to a differential, but i want you to tell me where you see anything on your build similar to this
creations-chat 2022-07-26 20:43:25 how thick is the tail section
creations-chat 2022-07-26 20:45:53 i was talking about the original, you seem to think that a driveshaft is the same thing as a transmission. <@883063424614006878> you can make one, you need a lot of motorlock tho to make the gears correct

contest-chat 2022-08-19 03:12:20 to be clear, this event is not just "make a steampunk build" it is to take a design, or vehicle from the century that was picked, and make it themed as steam punk
contest-chat 2022-08-19 03:14:43 istg if i see a single cold war jet that has just been repainted in orange or brown colors, i am going to lose it, your location will be beamed across the entire internet, your passwords, leaked for everyone to see

contest-chat 2022-08-20 03:31:13 also i can make a simple gearbox for u if u want me to
contest-chat 2022-08-20 04:03:55 the gearbox wirjs
contest-chat 2022-08-20 04:04:10 you now have a forward and reverse gear
contest-chat 2022-08-20 04:06:17 oh no
contest-chat 2022-08-20 04:06:19 what is it
contest-chat 2022-08-20 04:06:27 wdym
contest-chat 2022-08-20 04:07:02 what was it based on
contest-chat 2022-08-20 04:07:11 well yes
contest-chat 2022-08-20 04:07:17 but you said it wasnt valve based
contest-chat 2022-08-20 04:08:12 you dont need the 3 top ones\
contest-chat 2022-08-20 04:08:18 why would you need those
contest-chat 2022-08-20 04:08:24 the big wheel should be all you need
contest-chat 2022-08-20 04:08:31 also power is not an issue
contest-chat 2022-08-20 04:08:48 i can slap a turbo on it and give it some more power
contest-chat 2022-08-20 04:09:35 wdym
contest-chat 2022-08-20 04:09:45 join  vip 1 and lemme see the engine you made
contest-chat 2022-08-20 04:10:55 looks like it got a lot of torque
contest-chat 2022-08-20 04:11:04 and it will never stall due to piston timing
contest-chat 2022-08-20 04:11:14 so it shouldnt have random power loss
contest-chat 2022-08-20 04:11:23 idk how many pistons ur engine had
contest-chat 2022-08-20 04:12:22 idk i dont wanna spend time turning this into car
contest-chat 2022-08-20 04:12:42 uh]
contest-chat 2022-08-20 04:12:45 early morning
contest-chat 2022-08-20 04:13:01 oh wait
contest-chat 2022-08-20 04:13:03 no
contest-chat 2022-08-20 04:13:10 any time after 4
contest-chat 2022-08-20 04:13:25 k
contest-chat 2022-08-20 04:13:50 btw heres what it looks like
contest-chat 2022-08-20 04:14:02 depends
contest-chat 2022-08-20 04:14:10 if i can get my tank steering idea to work
contest-chat 2022-08-20 04:14:11 then no
contest-chat 2022-08-20 04:14:14 but if i cant
contest-chat 2022-08-20 04:14:19 then possibly yes
contest-chat 2022-08-20 04:15:24 i mean if it comes down to that then im just gonna ask piggles for his engine design and modify it since he got it smaller, his just had less torque
contest-chat 2022-08-20 04:16:11 maybe
contest-chat 2022-08-20 04:16:20 depends on how much space you will have
contest-chat 2022-08-20 04:16:31 cuz the engine and gearbox already gonna take up a bunch of space
contest-chat 2022-08-20 04:17:51 perhaos
contest-chat 2022-08-20 21:45:28 Mechanically, absolute banger, looks wise, idk that part is up to mint
contest-chat 2022-08-23 23:37:11 guys look at my epic progress on the contest build, i totally havent had this in my saves for years and dragged it out just for this contest !!!
contest-chat 2022-08-24 01:13:15 literally you my guy
contest-chat 2022-08-24 01:14:04 difference is that i was sarcastic, you were not
contest-chat 2022-08-24 06:14:42 ?
contest-chat 2022-08-24 06:16:22 what is gears airship
contest-chat 2022-08-24 06:16:33 im so confused
contest-chat 2022-08-24 10:11:30 idk what that is
bot-central 2022-08-26 05:04:20 -servers
contest-chat 2022-08-27 18:47:06 Lomper
contest-chat 2022-08-28 03:48:27 i would just like to say....
contest-chat 2022-08-28 03:48:34 before i absolutely destroy this guy
contest-chat 2022-08-28 03:48:54 now
contest-chat 2022-08-28 03:48:54 that his train might have ended up better if he remembered to paint the rest of it
contest-chat 2022-08-28 03:48:57 on to the rant
contest-chat 2022-08-28 03:49:02 where to start my guys?
contest-chat 2022-08-28 03:49:32 the lack of weathering on a train meant to be in SMOG filled world?
contest-chat 2022-08-28 03:50:13 the use of futuristic engines that he literally calls "hyperpower"?
contest-chat 2022-08-28 03:51:03 oh, oh, maybe the part about how he said that not all steampunk things have to have exposed gears and pipes, even though that is the style that steampunk is?
contest-chat 2022-08-28 03:52:18 you see, the reason they didnt use direct turbines on a steam train, is because it doesnt offer as much torque, you just made a less efficient steam train
contest-chat 2022-08-28 03:52:43 the fact it is pristine blue and white makes it not fit in any depiction of a steampunk world ever created
contest-chat 2022-08-28 03:53:12 you put 0 time into making the exhaust look anything near believable
contest-chat 2022-08-28 03:54:03 all you did was make a train you have wanted to make for a while, and just post it, you didnt make it steampunk, you made it more steampunk in your description of it that what you actually show on it
contest-chat 2022-08-28 03:55:04 that would be the equivalent of me posting a wwII tank to a futuristic competition and saying "the engine is a nuclear reactor and the gearbox is a cvt transmission"
contest-chat 2022-08-28 03:55:13 and then not changing the looks at all
contest-chat 2022-08-28 03:55:27 anything i missed?
contest-chat 2022-08-28 03:57:06 in the end, the horribly painted submission above yours is better simply because it actually went for the contest theme
contest-chat 2022-08-28 03:58:51 istg people are fucking stupid
contest-chat 2022-08-28 03:59:50 "JuSt BeCaUsE iTs StEaMpUnK dOeSnT mEaN iT hAs To HaVe ExPoSeD gEaRs"
contest-chat 2022-08-28 04:00:00 yes, that is literally what it means
contest-chat 2022-08-28 04:00:08 the whole point of steampunk
contest-chat 2022-08-28 04:00:11 is meant to be
contest-chat 2022-08-28 04:00:12 big
contest-chat 2022-08-28 04:00:14 clunky
contest-chat 2022-08-28 04:00:17 heavy
contest-chat 2022-08-28 04:00:20 oversized
contest-chat 2022-08-28 04:00:24 overcomplicated
contest-chat 2022-08-28 04:00:29 not elegant
contest-chat 2022-08-28 04:00:32 not clean
contest-chat 2022-08-28 04:01:28 your fate is sealed toot
contest-chat 2022-08-28 04:01:36 free trial of life ended soon
contest-chat 2022-08-28 04:03:49 also
contest-chat 2022-08-28 04:03:55 art streamlining
contest-chat 2022-08-28 04:03:59 was in the 1930s
contest-chat 2022-08-28 04:04:10 steampunk is late 1800s
contest-chat 2022-08-28 04:12:32 wdym ok and
contest-chat 2022-08-28 04:12:40 art streamlining didnt exist
contest-chat 2022-08-28 04:16:42 it was steampunk themes
contest-chat 2022-08-28 04:16:48 not 20th century themed
contest-chat 2022-08-28 04:17:25 thats what i been saying
contest-chat 2022-08-28 04:25:35 not rlly
contest-chat 2022-08-28 04:25:40 very simple actually
contest-chat 2022-08-28 04:25:48 since 21st century is future
contest-chat 2022-08-28 04:25:56 you can make custom things
contest-chat 2022-08-28 04:26:01 that still look steampunk
contest-chat 2022-08-28 04:26:07 yeah
contest-chat 2022-08-28 04:26:09 cool as shit
contest-chat 2022-08-28 04:26:32 https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742828914753142817/996995697591193660/unknown.png
contest-chat 2022-08-28 04:26:34 this
contest-chat 2022-08-28 04:26:40 is what that would sorta look like
contest-chat 2022-08-28 04:27:57 why would those matter
contest-chat 2022-08-28 04:28:04 they too small to make in plane crazy
contest-chat 2022-08-28 04:28:06 they like
contest-chat 2022-08-28 04:28:12 the size of a half wedge
contest-chat 2022-08-28 04:46:14 ok let me start this off by explaining how this competition was supposed to work
contest-chat 2022-08-28 04:46:37 you take 20th century concepts and ideas, and use steampunk tech to build it
contest-chat 2022-08-28 04:47:41 steam turbines arent used in steampunk art because they arent showy, they dont feel steampunky
contest-chat 2022-08-28 04:48:04 this is literally the way we explained it to rbk in vip chat
contest-chat 2022-08-28 04:48:26 indeed
contest-chat 2022-08-28 04:48:49 currently you could swap its title of steampunk with a diesel train, and you would change nothing
contest-chat 2022-08-28 04:49:08 literally the only thing tying your train to steam at all, is the coal
contest-chat 2022-08-28 04:49:11 and thats not much
contest-chat 2022-08-28 04:50:14 do you? take a look at any depiction of a steampunk world, not a single drawing will show that the world is clean
contest-chat 2022-08-28 04:50:18 because it isnt
contest-chat 2022-08-28 04:50:34 the world isnt clean
contest-chat 2022-08-28 04:50:35 becayse
contest-chat 2022-08-28 04:50:41 they use COAL
contest-chat 2022-08-28 04:50:45 which is DIRTY
contest-chat 2022-08-28 04:50:53 your coal box IS SOMEHOW CLEAN
contest-chat 2022-08-28 04:50:57 HOW DID YOU MANAGE THAT
contest-chat 2022-08-28 04:51:46 your tender looks like a diesel
contest-chat 2022-08-28 04:51:50 no joke
contest-chat 2022-08-28 04:52:00 
contest-chat 2022-08-28 04:52:55 ive already said that the only thing tying your train to steam is the coal
contest-chat 2022-08-28 04:53:03 remove the coal and what does your train look like
contest-chat 2022-08-28 04:53:06 a diesel
contest-chat 2022-08-28 04:53:23 the exhaust looks like hiroshima
contest-chat 2022-08-28 04:53:43 the cab looks like your DIESEL engine is taking up too much space in the front
contest-chat 2022-08-28 04:54:03 your wheels
contest-chat 2022-08-28 04:54:07 are completely black
contest-chat 2022-08-28 04:54:10 with blue on them
contest-chat 2022-08-28 04:55:27 you can barely tell they are coupling rods
contest-chat 2022-08-28 04:55:52 no
contest-chat 2022-08-28 04:56:04 i would rather you actually make them look like coupling rods
contest-chat 2022-08-28 04:56:12 they look like a rectangle attached to a cirlce
contest-chat 2022-08-28 04:56:36 atleast they rounded it
contest-chat 2022-08-28 04:57:00 you dont, you hide them
contest-chat 2022-08-28 04:57:39 also
contest-chat 2022-08-28 04:58:14 you never responded to my remark about how your description of your creation is more steampunk than what the actual build is
contest-chat 2022-08-28 04:58:31 yes
contest-chat 2022-08-28 04:58:34 exactly that
contest-chat 2022-08-28 04:58:53 no
contest-chat 2022-08-28 04:58:56 its because
contest-chat 2022-08-28 04:59:00 all the things you listed
contest-chat 2022-08-28 04:59:05 arent even in your build
contest-chat 2022-08-28 04:59:09 where is the turbine>
contest-chat 2022-08-28 04:59:30 what the fuck is a "hyperpower"
contest-chat 2022-08-28 04:59:47 ok so
contest-chat 2022-08-28 04:59:50 a made up engine
contest-chat 2022-08-28 04:59:57 great
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:01:01 you mean a radiator?
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:01:38 a condenser is taking steam and cooling it back into water, its a radiator
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:02:02 you want to know how to immediately make that radiator more steampunk?
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:02:08 put some big ass fans on it
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:02:20 again
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:02:23 all you did
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:02:26 was make a diesel
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:02:29 put coal in it
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:02:37 call it a steampunk train
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:02:53 and gave it a description that didnt even match the build
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:03:23 it also
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:03:26 again
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:03:31 does not look steampunk
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:03:33 which was
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:03:35 you know
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:03:38 the entire theme
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:03:54 the theme was not
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:04:02 no
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:04:20 this is the same thing https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/945400465133293639/1013310773835083846/stock-photo-steampunk-train-whit-path-161700467.jpg
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:04:23 but done better
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:04:41 this is also streamlined
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:04:47 YOU FINALLY GET IT
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:04:50 FINALLY
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:04:55 TOOK YOU LONG ENOUGH
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:04:58 STEAMPUNK
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:05:00 LIKE I SAID
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:05:06 IS NOT MEANT TO BE BEUATIFUL
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:05:12 IT IS MEANT TO BE RUGGED
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:05:13 POWERFULL
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:05:16 BULKY
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:05:53 losing my mind
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:05:56 'people are
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:05:59 too stupid
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:06:20 the contest was to make a steampunk themed 20th century build
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:06:21 not
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:06:40 build a creation if steam tech kept advancing
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:06:56 indeed
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:07:05 no
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:07:06 its not
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:07:15 you can look at any steampunk thing
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:07:17 and none of them
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:07:23 have any more advanced tech
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:07:31 than the 1800s
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:08:37 you are so fucking stupid i want to slap the shit out of you so fucking hard right now
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:08:43 im gonna use gods hand to fucking smite you
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:09:52 take a look at the internal workings of any steampunk art, its all the same, a classic steam engine, and you can tell its a steam engine
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:10:06 perhaps the tech around it has advanced
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:10:10 but the actual steam tech
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:10:11 has not
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:11:11 close, they are external combustion engines
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:11:29 what
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:11:40 how do you even argue that point
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:11:50 thats literally just a falsehood
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:12:12 ok stop sidetracking
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:12:19 i want to shit on your build some more now
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:12:39 why is your build completely clean
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:14:51 considering your engine is currently pumping out enough fumes to rival that of a fleet of dreadnaughts, i would like to know if you just have a worker sitting on top of the train constantly cleaning it
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:15:41 they getting sidetracked on god
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:15:56 eas
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:15:58 fr
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:16:38 yes, but you got the contest all wrong
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:17:29 you for some reason thought that it meant steam tech keeps advancing, when in reality, it meant old steam tech used to make 20th century things
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:19:26 indeed
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:19:44 i think i have provided enough evidence to show that he didnt even listen to the contest topic
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:19:50 this can stop now
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:21:05 ok are you able to vc rn? i might be able to explain this better
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:21:29 i can tell you exactly what you did wrong with the design
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:21:54 whats the block count without the landscaping
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:22:21 thats also way too much
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:22:26 my airship is 7-8k
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:23:05 dont underestimate
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:23:18 i got the swordfish done in that time
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:23:30 false
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:23:31 it was
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:23:32 like
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:23:35 30%
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:23:45 not debatable
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:23:47 it has
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:23:49 had
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:23:50 the nose
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:23:53 and the cockpit
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:23:56 and that was about it
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:24:13 false
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:24:16 those took me like
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:24:19 a day
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:24:20 or less
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:24:23 to figure out
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:24:27 also
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:24:33 i still had to rebuild all of it
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:24:39 from essentially memory
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:24:43 and pictures
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:25:07 still wish i would have done the paint better
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:25:14 idk why the weathering didnt show as well
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:25:19 in game i could see it
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:25:28 but in the pics it just wasnt there
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:25:51 uh.....
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:25:57 i had like
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:26:00 8 colors of red
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:26:55 do not even talk about weathering
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:27:16 you are banned from talking about weathering
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:27:40 this is why you are banned
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:27:59 again it was steampunk themed
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:28:19 they are
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:28:21 you just
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:28:23 failed
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:28:24 miserably
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:28:43 the other pictures of steampunk trains in that style clearly say otherwise
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:29:14 again
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:29:17 was
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:29:17 the topic
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:29:31 to take a 20th century idea or concept
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:29:36 and use steampunk tech
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:29:38 to make it
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:29:48 not the other way around
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:29:56 you are getting it messed up
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:30:22 can you even resubmit?
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:30:41 ok
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:31:08 the streamlining wasnt the problem
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:31:12 goddamn you dont lsiten
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:32:03 the 20th century concepts, was the streamlining, that was the good part, the problem was the lack of any steampunk aspects
bot-central 2022-08-28 05:33:19 -servers
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:34:03 it doesnt fit
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:34:06 stop saying it does
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:34:11 there is no steampunk aspect
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:34:27 steampunk does not = steam train
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:34:43 it was a good idea
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:34:44 it was
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:34:49 community problem
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:35:02 steam powered does not = steampunk'
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:35:35 steampunk does not = advanced steam tech
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:36:08 FRRRRRRRR
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:36:37 the streamlining isnt the problem LISTEN TO ME
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:39:04 if this guy, says one more thing about "advanced steam tech" im going to lose my shit
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:39:07 steampunk
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:39:11 is the opposite
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:39:14 of advanced steam tech

contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:44:16 yeah
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:46:00 say "take a 20th century concept or idea, and build it using steampunk technology" that should make it more clear so people dont get mixed up somehow
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:46:08 i dont even know how people dont understand this
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:46:23 its very easy to understand if you look at it for more than 2 seconds
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:46:32 the flywheelk

contest-chat 2022-08-31 03:36:04 <@928218139345420288> ok but.... what 20th century thing is that based on...

contest-chat 2022-08-31 03:37:05 now
contest-chat 2022-08-31 03:37:48 the tug boat is a 20th century thing
contest-chat 2022-08-31 03:37:54 easy
contest-chat 2022-08-31 03:38:15 idk
contest-chat 2022-08-31 03:38:17 a tug boat tho
contest-chat 2022-08-31 03:38:33 i dont think you can find any tugboats made after 1999 tbh
contest-chat 2022-08-31 03:38:50 yes
contest-chat 2022-08-31 03:38:57 its a tug boat
contest-chat 2022-08-31 03:39:09 yes?
contest-chat 2022-08-31 03:39:19 what about it
contest-chat 2022-08-31 03:40:07 i dont understand what point you are trying to make here, he is one of the only ones who has actually followed the rules
contest-chat 2022-08-31 03:40:16 even if it doesnt look good
contest-chat 2022-08-31 03:40:29 now show the 20th century design of ur creation
contest-chat 2022-08-31 03:41:38 HOW IS NOBODY UNDERSTANDING THIS CONTEST
contest-chat 2022-08-31 03:41:40 IT IS
contest-chat 2022-08-31 03:41:46 VERY VERY SIMPLE
contest-chat 2022-08-31 03:43:02 you werent supposed to look up "steampunk 20th century" and create whats there, you were supposed to take a thing from the 20th century, and make it look steampunk
contest-chat 2022-08-31 03:43:43 clearly
contest-chat 2022-08-31 03:44:05 still havent shown what 20th century thing ur creation is based on
contest-chat 2022-08-31 03:45:10 ok so clearly you are avoiding the question, meaning the thing you made is just a custom steampunk build
contest-chat 2022-08-31 03:45:49 <@466793357318815744> we got another one, somehow they didnt understand the very simple instructions again, time to remove from contest submission
contest-chat 2022-08-31 03:48:37 pcc people on their way to show how stupid they are by misunderstanding the contest for the thousandth time
contest-chat 2022-08-31 05:14:58 i don think so
contest-chat 2022-08-31 05:17:33 turns out they are all custom
contest-chat 2022-08-31 05:17:42 contest fail
contest-chat 2022-08-31 05:17:51 the tugboat wins by no competition

contest-chat 2022-09-01 13:30:30 (he does) (what you made isnt anything like his style lo)
contest-chat 2022-09-01 13:54:23 well he kinda
contest-chat 2022-09-01 13:54:28 rigged a bunch of his stuff
contest-chat 2022-09-01 13:54:32 to get it into hof
contest-chat 2022-09-01 13:54:48 no it was uh
contest-chat 2022-09-01 13:54:58 something with the reactions]
contest-chat 2022-09-01 13:55:10 i dont remember completely
contest-chat 2022-09-01 13:56:08 idk just dont like him, dont like a lot of the top builders here
contest-chat 2022-09-03 12:31:55 You say that, but you also didn't participate
contest-chat 2022-09-03 12:58:31 I prob would have participated if i hadnt started working on a steampunk thing before the contest
contest-chat 2022-09-06 17:57:01 Instantly declined
contest-chat 2022-09-06 17:57:40 Anybody who wants to win a contest just for vip access kinda
contest-chat 2022-09-06 17:57:44 Super shallow
contest-chat 2022-09-06 21:09:24 ugly af, ur not gonna win simply because the plane doesnt look good
contest-chat 2022-09-06 21:10:17 even if you make a perfect copy, you wont win the contest because the original plane is a heaping pile of shit
contest-chat 2022-09-06 21:11:08 a few
contest-chat 2022-09-06 21:11:22 if u want to make props
contest-chat 2022-09-06 21:12:03 hs 129, either varient, an il2 of some sort, an me 410 is a great choice , a bf 110 is another good one
contest-chat 2022-09-06 21:14:26 you "could" also build a stuka but i would advise against it as its a pretty basic build
contest-chat 2022-09-08 12:06:16 Any roscale aircraft will be removed
contest-chat 2022-09-08 12:06:50 Then its called a mini build
contest-chat 2022-09-08 12:07:21 Just use a normal scale
contest-chat 2022-09-08 12:07:58 U have a landing gear wheel? Make it 1x1, there you go you have the scale for the rest of ur aircraft
contest-chat 2022-09-08 12:08:05 It really is that simple
contest-chat 2022-09-08 12:09:12 Use whatever scale is convenient
contest-chat 2022-09-08 12:09:22 Don't confine to pcc standards
contest-chat 2022-09-08 12:09:32 (They are shit anyway)
contest-chat 2022-09-08 14:26:17 Depends on aircraft
contest-chat 2022-09-08 14:27:36 If im gonna use an actual person for scale i just say that a person is 3 or 4 blocks tall
contest-chat 2022-09-08 14:27:46 Simplifies everything
contest-chat 2022-09-08 14:28:39 No
contest-chat 2022-09-08 14:29:26 If you use a 1x1 front wheel on a tail dragging aircraft then the tail wheel would most likely be a landing gear block
contest-chat 2022-09-08 14:29:59 And then u just use tnt to remove the box around the wheel

contest-chat 2022-10-12 05:33:53 It baffles me
contest-chat 2022-10-19 13:41:51 I would rate your viper a 0/10 simply because you gave yourself a 9/10
contest-chat 2022-10-19 13:44:00 Anyone who is that full of themself is not worth the time

contest-chat 2022-10-19 13:48:58 Because thats not even a 7/10
contest-chat 2022-10-19 13:49:47 Idk
contest-chat 2022-10-19 13:50:03 You want me to point out everything wrong with it?
contest-chat 2022-10-19 13:50:31 Ok
contest-chat 2022-10-19 13:50:38 Lets start with the blades
contest-chat 2022-10-19 13:50:45 They arent even attached
contest-chat 2022-10-19 13:50:55 They are powered by rockets
contest-chat 2022-10-19 13:51:04 They have a curve at the end for no reason
contest-chat 2022-10-19 13:51:48 The blades themselves arent even angled in the pic, therefore creating 0 luft
contest-chat 2022-10-19 13:52:07 Its not hiding anything and it just looks bad
contest-chat 2022-10-19 13:53:12 Again, it doesn't look good, and its very visible
contest-chat 2022-10-19 13:53:27 There isnt meant to be a curve
contest-chat 2022-10-19 13:53:41 No that is still very easy to see
contest-chat 2022-10-19 13:53:50 Now onto the body
contest-chat 2022-10-19 13:54:02 1 wide, which means they are a roscaler
contest-chat 2022-10-19 13:54:10 Automatic point loss
contest-chat 2022-10-19 13:54:33 The engine intake, doesn't even have a hole
contest-chat 2022-10-19 13:54:48 Its just flat black squares
contest-chat 2022-10-19 13:55:01 The text is floating on the body
contest-chat 2022-10-19 13:55:12 The tail section is morbidly obese
contest-chat 2022-10-19 13:55:51 SEE???
contest-chat 2022-10-19 13:55:57 They are ASS
contest-chat 2022-10-19 13:56:42 Hiver thrusters are smaller, faster, more powerful, and look better
contest-chat 2022-10-19 13:57:01 And rockets spew blue and make a lot of noise
contest-chat 2022-10-19 13:57:13 They are just worse
contest-chat 2022-10-19 13:57:21 Exactly
contest-chat 2022-10-19 13:57:58 The rocket pods on the pylons are clipping into eachother
contest-chat 2022-10-19 13:58:14 Sounds awful
contest-chat 2022-10-19 13:58:18 Also
contest-chat 2022-10-19 13:58:30 Bruh
contest-chat 2022-10-19 13:59:04 Do you even... know how to build at a high level....
contest-chat 2022-10-19 13:59:11 Because this heli
contest-chat 2022-10-19 13:59:28 To every person who builds at high level
contest-chat 2022-10-19 13:59:34 Looks like crap
contest-chat 2022-10-19 14:00:02 Would you mind showing said helis?
contest-chat 2022-10-19 14:00:13 Roscaler
contest-chat 2022-10-19 14:00:15 Gross
contest-chat 2022-10-19 14:00:30 2 wide 💪
contest-chat 2022-10-19 14:01:12 As long as your creation is scaled to itself then it's fine
contest-chat 2022-10-19 14:01:15 But that heli isn't
contest-chat 2022-10-19 14:01:18 Its too thin
contest-chat 2022-10-19 14:02:29 Fir the most part
contest-chat 2022-10-19 14:02:35 Some of it is floating
contest-chat 2022-10-19 14:03:25 Yeah
contest-chat 2022-10-19 14:03:45 So true
contest-chat 2022-10-19 14:03:55 This is why you should never build 1 wide
contest-chat 2022-10-19 14:04:45 Frrrr
contest-chat 2022-10-19 14:05:35 Your joking
contest-chat 2022-10-19 14:06:38 That is not building at a high level 💀
contest-chat 2022-10-19 14:07:08 Thats avpublic pvp build my guy
contest-chat 2022-10-19 14:07:35 Thats what it looks like
contest-chat 2022-10-19 14:08:21 I rate, all my builds at a max of 7, except my contest build, that one is an 8 because i didn't paint it well enough
contest-chat 2022-10-19 14:08:46 Mostly because all my builds rn are wip from 2 years ago
contest-chat 2022-10-19 14:08:58 Every single project
contest-chat 2022-10-19 14:09:26 The sad thing is that those wip from 2 years ago look better than modern pcc builds
contest-chat 2022-10-19 14:10:51 I put my hovers as far inward as possible
contest-chat 2022-10-19 14:10:57 So they arent seen
contest-chat 2022-10-19 14:11:19 Not worth it
contest-chat 2022-10-19 14:11:34 Not as high rpm
contest-chat 2022-10-19 14:11:41 If you can
contest-chat 2022-10-19 14:11:43 Yes
contest-chat 2022-10-19 14:11:59 My alluette gets too high rpm
contest-chat 2022-10-19 14:12:15 The motors start falling off their base
contest-chat 2022-10-19 14:12:28 Hes gone
contest-chat 2022-10-19 14:25:36 I dont ever go for performance, its an afterthought if it flies, i focus on looks first, functionality second
