creations-chat 2020-05-11 07:52:08 Its 12:51 and i had a long day, cut me some slack

creations-chat 2020-05-11 07:54:23 Somebody direct me to the rules, i cant find them rn
creations-chat 2020-05-11 07:54:35 Thx
creations-chat 2020-05-11 07:55:26 Northwest
creations-chat 2020-05-11 07:55:53 And where do rules 1 and 2 play a role in the who debate that happened?
creations-chat 2020-05-11 07:56:35 Those rules talk about creations
creations-chat 2020-05-11 07:56:58 I just read them, its about the creation
creations-chat 2020-05-11 07:59:06 Rule 2 plays a role, rule 1 doesnt really help that much as there was a little debate that has resolved itself, and <@582834773773254656> i think u need a gamepass
creations-chat 2020-05-11 07:59:28 Yea
creations-chat 2020-05-11 07:59:51 That doesnt sound right
creations-chat 2020-05-11 08:01:23 All gamepasses should be listed under shop
creations-chat 2020-05-11 08:02:08 If it never came out in an official update
creations-chat 2020-05-11 08:04:12 How about we wait a cuple of days and see if anybody found it then
creations-chat 2020-05-11 08:07:22 Sound like a plan?
