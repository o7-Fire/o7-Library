help 2023-03-03 15:28:33 i cant seem to balance my ship for vtol
help 2023-03-03 15:29:53 one of the sides is heavier than the other even tho theyre exactly the same
help 2023-03-03 15:30:44 fixed it a little but its still out of balance
help 2023-03-03 15:30:56 already tried, 1 is too less 2 is too much
help 2023-03-03 15:36:53 it stays in balance for a bit but when i throw up the thrusters it gets out of balance again
help 2023-03-03 15:37:08 is there anything else thats easier i can use than thrusters?
help 2023-03-04 11:38:24 ye but the point is that i can go vtol at any height
help 2023-03-04 11:38:40 do i have to put the hover trhusters on the inside of the ship or outside to balance it?
help 2023-03-04 11:43:50 it works but when i go forward it tilts like this
help 2023-03-04 11:46:50 i think i should just try start with a smaller ship
