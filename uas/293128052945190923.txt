bot-central 2020-06-26 15:33:56 ?shelp
bot-central 2020-06-26 15:36:53 &suggestion I believe that we are in need of a weapons revamp. The guns and rockets are nice, but with this jew summer event, we can see how much more is possible. I suggest you add things like Cannons, so tanks don’t have to shoot missiles as explosive rounds. Maybe add torpedos and more water based weapons, and I am also asking for maybe a revamp on how some weapons look, like maybe make a gun look like a gun? Or make an option to make the gun invisible when we spawn in so that the cool gun part designs aren’t ruined by this awkward block.
creations-chat 2020-06-26 15:39:18 Mmmm
creations-chat 2020-06-26 15:39:28 Anyone got any other tank suggestions?

creations-chat 2020-07-13 16:12:00 So should I have the turrets just one 1 5x5 cylinder?
creations-chat 2020-07-13 16:12:01 
creations-chat 2020-07-13 16:16:22 <@!455915220737589259> Should I lower the turrets 1 block, two blocks?
creations-chat 2020-07-14 17:04:07 So, I made a US naval vessel
creations-chat 2020-07-14 17:04:23 And it got downvoted a lot.
creations-chat 2020-07-14 17:04:39 I need 10 upvotes to be an expert shipwright
creations-chat 2020-07-14 17:04:58 I think the reason is because the turrets are to tall.
creations-chat 2020-07-14 17:05:09 But the turrets are really hard to make.
creations-chat 2020-07-14 17:05:39 So I’m thinking
creations-chat 2020-07-14 17:05:46 What if I just add an inside?
creations-chat 2020-07-14 17:06:02 Furnish it
creations-chat 2020-07-14 17:07:01 This is what I got rn

creations-chat 2020-07-14 18:14:55 
creations-chat 2020-07-14 22:40:29 Anyone got an idea to what I should change those big guns to?
creations-chat 2020-07-14 22:40:54 They to tall...
creations-chat 2020-07-14 22:41:05 Plus I don’t think they the right kind for the size of the ship
creations-chat 2020-07-14 22:41:40 Hmmm

help 2021-05-18 20:20:22 How does one make it so you can use a motor to angle blocks then release motor lock, without the angled block glitching out
help 2021-05-18 20:21:03 Because I tried to angle some wings, but as soon as I tried to fly they glitched out and Snapped into a different position.
help 2021-05-18 20:26:42 Wait, but... huh, I thought motor 2s were needed because they can lock in position
help 2021-05-18 20:27:32 Wait no, I mean that motor 2s can toggle
help 2021-05-18 20:28:40 So, just use motor 1s to lock at angles?
help 2021-05-18 20:28:45 Not to lock
help 2021-05-18 20:28:59 To angle parts so they stay in that angle when released?
help 2021-05-18 20:30:28 But I need my wings to stay at a certain angle, so I used motor two, hut then they glitch out and pop into a different position
help 2021-05-18 20:31:28 But I am locking them into other blocks. Can’t block something if its in another block
help 2021-05-18 20:34:16 You are a godsend. Thanks mate.

help 2021-05-18 20:37:43 Or a way to attach bombs to the wings, but not look really clunky and bad.

help 2021-05-18 20:42:02 I can motor lock. It already heavily is.
help 2021-05-18 20:43:45 I also found out I can make motor 2s turn wing flaps from inside the body of an aircraft, but the motor 2 has to be inside a block directly next to the flap, so motor lock is involved.

creations-chat 2021-12-07 21:27:07 Why would you make a Japanese plane for the 80th anniversary of Pearl Harbor…
creations-chat 2021-12-07 21:30:34 Then why would he commemorate Pearl Harbor… And then still, why would he make a Japanese plane that attacked Pearl Harbor, ON ITS 80TH ANNIVERSARY
creations-chat 2021-12-07 21:36:18 Yeah this seems kind of screwed up.
creations-chat 2021-12-07 21:38:22 THEY SAID IT WAS MADE FOR THE ANNIVERSARY OF PEARL HARBOR IN THE MESSAGES THEY POSTED IN <#384025409945337856>
creations-chat 2021-12-07 21:41:54 <@!750712383227428945> So why did you decide to do a Zero for Pearl Harbor.
creations-chat 2021-12-07 21:46:03 Weird analogy, and then if you didn’t want to honor the men who died in the attack, which is why we remember pearl harbor, why not do nothing? This seems directly disrespectful to those who died, not America itself.
creations-chat 2021-12-07 21:51:03 You seem to think that the men who died in pearl harbor were responsible, whoch they weren’t, we dont take the time to disrespect your men who died in WW1, so don’t take the time to disrespect ours. Like i said, do nothing.
creations-chat 2021-12-07 21:59:58 Yet the plane you decided to make is one that attacked Pearl Harbor, and iu decided to confirm that it was for the anniversary. That seems pretty disrespectful to me.
creations-chat 2021-12-07 22:32:56 I’m just trying to reach the core of why, if this were twitter I would be nonsensically throwing weird articles and screaming.
creations-chat 2021-12-07 22:36:26 Yeah thats correct for the most part. There were probably some exceptions but that mindset is why we chose the bomb over invading Japan. We’d have to fight the entire civilian population to win,which would result in so SO many more deaths than the bombs causes.
creations-chat 2021-12-07 22:39:34 Sorry, the correlation is engrained in my brain. I’m a but of the war buff.
creations-chat 2021-12-07 22:44:29 Then leave. As far as I’m concerned our discussion is over and solved.
creations-chat 2021-12-07 23:09:46 Ikr
creations-chat 2021-12-10 19:20:30 How does that even work?
the-dump 2021-12-10 19:25:26 And thats a tank destroyer, bruh
creations-chat 2021-12-10 22:30:53 Well I can see that, but how to they turn independently without turning the plane itself

creations-chat 2021-12-22 22:10:54 What constitues normally? We all build the same way, but we can add things to  make it more compact, also I don't use motorlock much for asthetic and my builds still got likes. My best one used none and I got an expert role from it.
creations-chat 2021-12-22 22:12:58 Ok, but don't expect us to applaud you for making a vehicle for a purpose that most people already accomplish. Here we award for building skill, not building purpose.
creations-chat 2021-12-22 22:17:31 Look buddy, you can argue why you made it, how you made it, and the philosophical meaning of life, but thats not gonna change anyone here's minds. It looks bad.
creations-chat 2021-12-22 22:20:43 It looks random, and as someone who has a stupid obsession with armored history, it makes no sense engineering wise.
creations-chat 2021-12-22 22:24:37 Dude, no one cares that you say "Its for shredders" and "Its not that bad" this argument is pointless.
creations-chat 2021-12-22 22:28:28 I had a stroke reading this, and also, explosive blocks can be used on them too. Your tank looks bad, and we are here to review looks, not functionality. If you want that, go to <#384021699466756107> or something.
creations-chat 2021-12-22 22:31:11 I don't think you are in a position to bargain.

Hopefully he won't be here all week.

creations-chat 2022-01-13 18:20:46 <@!567763933952475157> thats a nice tank, how did you make that barrel though? I always find that tank guns get really bulky and its hard to make nice ones that are compact
creations-chat 2022-01-13 19:04:45 Ok thanks, now I just need to figure out how to make compact tank turrets that WORK.
creations-chat 2022-01-14 00:46:52 ok, follow up, how do you get all the sparkelers in a line
creations-chat 2022-01-14 00:49:43 They only connect to other blocks from the back
creations-chat 2022-01-14 00:54:08 Ah
creations-chat 2022-01-14 16:05:15 Does the gun have vertical movement?
creations-chat 2022-01-14 16:07:48 Nice what is your method of making compact turrets? I’m trying to learn but it isn’t going so well. How do you get the sparklers to stick?


Dang, I hate trying to change viewpoints with cameras, and I assume a lot of motor lock
