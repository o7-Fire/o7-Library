plane-crazy 2020-06-27 19:08:14 So the bomber flys, but its hard to turn
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 18:31:16 <@!645834473115484188> getting on
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 18:29:30 So you can control your ship from different parts.
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 18:29:19 OOOH
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 18:16:11 Oh yeah
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 18:15:53 I’ll be on in a sec.
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 18:14:13 Sure... I honestly don’t know MUCH about mech making, but after I finish my bomber, I’ll try to learn more.
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 18:11:07 It acts as suspension, and support.
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 18:10:35 Yeah
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 18:10:30 Well, it works really well with my mech.
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 18:09:27 <@!432354194960416769> sorry man, its my friend’s personal design, and I told them I’m not gonna five it to anyone else. I can give you a little help, try rope connected with suspension.
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 18:06:35 I have this really good mech leg design.
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 18:02:52 <@!658319788904546334> yeah, mouse controlled one, I use those.
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 17:52:29 I use turrets and they work underwater.
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 17:38:21 I’m confused
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 17:36:22 Wuuuuuut
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 17:36:16 Wait, put wings in the wings.
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 17:35:24 Ik,wut
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 17:34:44 I want my bomber to look realistic, so I don’t want to keep adding wings.
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 17:34:18 Damn son
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 17:32:55 So... how powerful is this thing, because I have tons of super rocket engines and it flys, but won’t turn or go up or down.
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 17:32:18 I could out it in the back area
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 17:32:12 Well
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 17:30:46 The problem is most of my fuesaloge is filled with the bomb bay
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 17:29:36 Yay
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 17:29:17 Are they laggy?
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 17:28:16 Idk hoe to make those.
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 17:28:11 Conveyor?
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 17:22:38 My bomber is beeg.
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 17:22:30 DAMN
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 17:22:28 Can’t in general?
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 17:21:10 Um, so when you submit a plane to get a rank, to helium blocks not count or something?
plane-crazy 2020-06-10 19:45:21 That looks good.
plane-crazy 2020-06-10 19:45:17 Bruh
plane-crazy 2020-06-10 03:26:48 Oh
plane-crazy 2020-06-10 03:26:04 <@!405023786526834689> send some picks from in build mode so I can see the actual build.
plane-crazy 2020-06-10 03:22:33 If so, could you send me pics? I wanna make one.
plane-crazy 2020-06-10 03:22:19 Has anyone made a longsword from Halo?
plane-crazy 2020-06-10 03:20:51 Will god forgive me
plane-crazy 2020-06-10 03:20:45 I made a WW1 tank with a naval turret on the top
plane-crazy 2020-06-10 03:10:45 Thats toxic as all hell.
plane-crazy 2020-06-10 03:10:41 Oh yeah no.
plane-crazy 2020-06-10 03:09:59 I have a team of those swarming cutter flying things, but I only use them on people to take advantage of peoples spawns.
plane-crazy 2020-06-09 16:36:12 Whoah
