help 2021-11-24 18:27:07 i know it requires angle locking, but i'm not very experienced in it.
help 2021-11-24 19:04:28 hmm, maybe. Im not very good at making compact motor lock systems

the-dump 2023-01-09 02:54:45 so having a different color name sets you above the people without a color right?

creations-chat 2023-02-02 14:22:33 reshade has that quality of roughness and metallic?
creations-chat 2023-02-02 14:43:09 planes do require (in my experience) much more motorlocking than ships
creations-chat 2023-02-02 14:45:32 hate to break it to you, but you definitely came to the wrong place for constructive criticism. 97% of people are going to insult you and your build beyond comprehension, without actually being useful in the slightest

as you can see here
creations-chat 2023-02-02 14:47:47 someone who doesnt play pc would give better advice then the people here
creations-chat 2023-02-02 14:49:54 wdym face comments everyone here just asked him how he had expert and insulted everything about his build. theres a difference between facing criticism rather then outright insults and rudeness. you're the only person who has bothered to help him
the-dump 2023-02-06 21:36:34 its completely impossible not to get down votes on builds

the-dump 2023-02-19 20:37:25 the creations blacklist adds to the effect
the-dump 2023-02-19 20:39:04 mods could take over the server and no one would know

creations-chat 2023-02-23 14:37:06 <@957638828854759424>  you should probably search for for other human catapults before claiming yours is the first

the-dump 2023-04-01 16:00:10 based on what
the-dump 2023-04-07 03:14:11 isn't it recommended to get away from the deer effected by that
the-dump 2023-04-07 03:14:19 even if it isn't, run
the-dump 2023-04-07 03:15:26 i don't think thats why you shouldn't go near it
the-dump 2023-04-07 03:15:34 its a mentally insane wild animal
the-dump 2023-04-07 03:16:30 it should be logic to put as much distance between you and anything that looks like that as possible
the-dump 2023-04-07 03:18:01 do people actually believe those exists?
the-dump 2023-04-07 03:18:08 like i get its a joke and all
the-dump 2023-04-07 03:18:29 but their existence was likely mistaken for a prion disease victim
the-dump 2023-04-07 03:18:55 so glad i live in a place without that
the-dump 2023-04-07 03:19:24 honestly i don't blame them if i saw that id probably crap a brick too
the-dump 2023-04-07 03:19:40 i live in florida 😎
the-dump 2023-04-07 03:19:51 all the animals here already want to kill you
the-dump 2023-04-07 03:20:10 but at least they don't look like they would enjoy killing you
the-dump 2023-04-07 03:20:18 unlike that forsaken deer
the-dump 2023-04-07 03:20:38 80% of them will kill you if try

creations-chat 2023-05-09 01:56:39 <@723567564743245864> just as a bit of advice, the goal is to have the least amount of exposed motorlock as possible, not the most
