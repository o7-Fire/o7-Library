plane-crazy 2020-06-21 18:34:21 Fine what about being able to swim in the lava in the summer event lol
plane-crazy 2020-06-21 18:33:40 So it would have to be anchored
plane-crazy 2020-06-21 18:33:28 Im talking about the terrain water
plane-crazy 2020-06-21 18:32:40 We need water as a block
plane-crazy 2020-06-21 18:32:05 We need shock absorbers
plane-crazy 2020-06-21 18:01:56 Imagine if rick shut down plane crazy for good today lol
plane-crazy 2020-06-21 16:54:55 aww man test server got closed
plane-crazy 2020-06-21 15:49:22 k I assume that rick is doing ze update later today

plane-crazy 2020-06-21 06:53:41 You know that feeling when you play plane crazy too much and it is boring now?
plane-crazy 2020-06-21 05:04:30 Wow this entire day rickje wasnâ€™t online
plane-crazy 2020-06-21 02:08:14 yeah ik
plane-crazy 2020-06-21 02:08:01 and he bans you
plane-crazy 2020-06-21 02:07:56 he gets rlly mad
plane-crazy 2020-06-21 02:07:48 he was active for so long earlier
plane-crazy 2020-06-21 02:07:12 I delayed an update on my game for a month and legit nobody said anything
plane-crazy 2020-06-21 02:06:56 I respect that
plane-crazy 2020-06-21 02:06:51 to kink out some bugs
plane-crazy 2020-06-21 02:06:47 they are prob just delaying it
plane-crazy 2020-06-21 02:06:33 bro is the update going to drop at 12 am or something? <@!217336009455566848> ?
plane-crazy 2020-06-21 01:13:38 well the event is probably tomorrow at this rate
plane-crazy 2020-06-21 01:01:02 why is dev server closed D:
plane-crazy 2020-06-21 00:37:12 sowee I got a little out of hand there
plane-crazy 2020-06-21 00:37:03 BRO WHEN IS SUMMER EVENT COMING OUT I THOUGHT IT WAS TODAYYYY
plane-crazy 2020-06-21 00:06:42 lol mad is offline now
plane-crazy 2020-06-21 00:06:14 update isn't out yet
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 23:36:40 
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 23:36:00 SIR
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 23:32:01 good point
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 23:30:53 nice car
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 23:30:43 if it is how?
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 23:30:35 also I don't think water jet is pvp item lol
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 23:30:25 imagine if water jets could make water wheels spin faster by shooting them with water
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 23:29:43 water jet will be really useful for me cuz my washing machine only has blue smoke
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 23:29:24 ik some people who use it all the time for pvp
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 23:29:09 people take pride in lava spitter tho
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 23:29:00 good point
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 23:28:37 I have never attended any event on plane crazy cuz I usually go on vacation
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 23:28:20 for some of them
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 23:28:17 well
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 23:28:12 cuz now their rarest and oldest items are not rare anymore
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 23:27:43 I feel bad for people who actually got those events when they were out
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 23:27:25 im hyped either way because they legit brought half of the events back
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 23:27:04 so it doesn't matter anyways
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 23:26:59 but I think it is run by local scripts
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 23:26:50 or water jet
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 23:26:47 cuz it means I won't have to deal with anybody else ruining the lava spitter
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 23:26:27 bro I am glad that I renewed my vip server a few days ago
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 23:25:50 lol
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 23:25:47 we need 1/4 block
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 23:25:42 wait
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 23:25:40 n't
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 23:25:38 wedges could
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 23:25:35 wedges couldn'
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 23:25:24 cuz half wedge down and the half wedge stair thing
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 23:25:05 stairs will make seamless folds much easier
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 23:24:21 well since the event ends on september 22th, maybe they are waiting until june 22th to release it so you will have an even like 4 months, but that would be sad
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 17:27:51 bro im getting too hyped for this event its not good
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 15:57:10 Half of me wants the event item to be the same as last year cuz I missed the lava spitter, but half of me wants a new thing.
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 15:26:12 Can somebody please give me a date for the summer event?
plane-crazy 2020-06-19 15:16:32 tmr I think summer event will be out
plane-crazy 2020-06-19 06:13:52 It says I donâ€™t have access to play the development game, is there any way for me to sneak a peek of the new event or nah?
plane-crazy 2020-06-19 06:08:25 How do I gain access to the vip servers? I have roles
plane-crazy 2020-06-19 06:05:34 Is the summer event tomorrow?
plane-crazy 2020-06-12 05:11:20 https://youtu.be/zOKjpyXLBOA I have successfully destroyed the world by making a tutorial on protrodeâ€™s compressed tnt.
plane-crazy 2020-06-07 17:02:20 thanks

plane-crazy 2020-05-20 23:54:32 <:Trigje139:559518788660232196>
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 14:15:02 I read the rules though? It says nothing about the role and the only role reference is about #roles
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 14:13:06 lol
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 14:13:01 and then I reacted to everything
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 14:12:56 I did
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 14:12:21 how do you even get the "you read the rules" role?
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 14:09:33 now the new plane crazy players will never know about outlines D:
plane-crazy 2020-05-17 16:24:49 I missed legit all the events ðŸ˜¦
plane-crazy 2020-05-17 16:24:38 summer was lava spitter right?
plane-crazy 2020-05-17 16:14:18 will the event items from last year be coming back this year? I went to the lab today and you can press the emergency button now on one of the lab rooms.
plane-crazy 2020-05-17 15:26:32 this is what it looks like when compressed
plane-crazy 2020-05-17 15:11:27 I legit made a tornado
plane-crazy 2020-05-17 15:11:21 I have done lots of things with suspension before
plane-crazy 2020-05-17 15:11:08 <@!299289130964090881>  thanks for the compliment, the next thing that I want to do is find out a way to make a suspension cannon that can fire it, so far its been tough
plane-crazy 2020-05-17 03:52:48 I have to use 2 magnet engines at max power with superstrength just to make it go 50 speed
plane-crazy 2020-05-17 03:52:19 that roomba better be strong
plane-crazy 2020-05-17 03:52:11 lol its really really heavy
plane-crazy 2020-05-17 03:43:26 I promise not to abuse it.
plane-crazy 2020-05-17 03:43:04 I made a compressed nuke. Yes, I am at the max tnt block limit that is why there is a chunk missing in the corner, and this is really laggy to use.
plane-crazy 2020-05-16 20:29:01 too fast
plane-crazy 2020-05-16 20:29:00 oh I see now
plane-crazy 2020-05-16 20:27:46 I slowed it down
plane-crazy 2020-05-16 20:27:42 yes
plane-crazy 2020-05-16 20:27:04 can somebody help me, I am trying to make a torpedo but when it turns it just flips over, https://www.roblox.com/games/166986752/Plane-Crazy?privateServerLinkCode=bTE2NwfGDxvgeVOX0JlRFfqRL1xibjDG is the link to join me to help.
plane-crazy 2020-05-16 19:22:13 it was pointless
plane-crazy 2020-05-16 19:22:10 I shouldn't have pinged
plane-crazy 2020-05-16 19:22:06 you make a really good point
plane-crazy 2020-05-16 19:22:01 hmm
plane-crazy 2020-05-16 19:18:58 <@!217336009455566848> ill pay you 180 robux for the speaker gamepass, thats all I am willing to pay, because it is way too expensive XD
plane-crazy 2020-05-16 19:04:30 by making really big rock candy
plane-crazy 2020-05-15 18:28:01 what is the point of a para nuke
plane-crazy 2020-05-14 23:22:08 im just doing this from my head
plane-crazy 2020-05-14 23:21:51 frame
plane-crazy 2020-05-14 23:21:49 also what is a skeleton fram?
plane-crazy 2020-05-14 23:21:40 ok its control surfaces now
plane-crazy 2020-05-14 23:17:17 but I mean that doesn't matter too much because vip servers have no gravity XD
plane-crazy 2020-05-14 23:17:01 its way less blocks now
plane-crazy 2020-05-14 23:16:53 how does this look?
plane-crazy 2020-05-14 23:10:53 oh
plane-crazy 2020-05-14 23:10:07 just finished the first propellor on my heli carrier, how does it look?
plane-crazy 2020-05-14 06:04:47 I have low self-confidence, is my meme good?
plane-crazy 2020-05-14 06:04:09 Plane crazy-related lol

plane-crazy 2020-05-14 03:54:58 hmm
plane-crazy 2020-05-14 03:50:45 I got a vip server up
plane-crazy 2020-05-14 03:50:39 anybody want to show me their builds?

plane-crazy 2020-05-14 01:55:58 can you ping him for me
plane-crazy 2020-05-14 01:43:12 hmm what should I build guys
plane-crazy 2020-05-14 01:42:26 probably not
plane-crazy 2020-05-14 01:42:23 hmm should I ping or no?
plane-crazy 2020-05-14 01:40:39 it makes no sense
plane-crazy 2020-05-14 01:40:35 and speakers cost more than 3 USD
plane-crazy 2020-05-14 01:40:19 that is an eighth of 1 USD
plane-crazy 2020-05-14 01:40:08 I mean vip servers cost 10 robux
plane-crazy 2020-05-14 01:39:57 rickje I won't ping you but I will ask, can you please lower the price of the speakers since apparently they are glitchy anyways?
plane-crazy 2020-05-14 00:56:38 nvm

plane-crazy 2020-05-14 00:56:16 where do I place the guns so it will stack right?

plane-crazy 2020-05-14 00:45:00 it looks as though they attached a rocket to a trail
plane-crazy 2020-05-14 00:44:47 how do you even manage to do that lol

plane-crazy 2020-05-13 23:47:04 OH COME ON
plane-crazy 2020-05-13 23:46:13 bruh its more than 3 USD for speakers on plane crazy
plane-crazy 2020-05-13 23:45:48 speakers are way too expensive
plane-crazy 2020-05-13 23:45:22 only because it was cheap
plane-crazy 2020-05-13 23:45:17 instead I bought a vip server for no reason lol
plane-crazy 2020-05-13 23:45:08 I didn't buy speaker
