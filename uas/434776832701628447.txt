help 2020-12-11 03:03:20 How do people get their wings to be at an angle? I cant seem to get the motors to work
help 2020-12-11 03:30:37 lmao I dont mean like that, I mean when people have their wings connected to motors and angle it and can direct their wings to fly much better
help 2020-12-11 03:36:57 Probably
help 2020-12-11 03:37:30 Im brand new so whatever it is it just keeps the wings at an degree that cant normally be achieved
help 2020-12-11 03:57:57 oh cool
help 2020-12-11 03:58:05 Its crazy how fast all of those jets turn
help 2020-12-11 04:18:05 could you maybe show me an example of how the elevators are placed? I still have no clue how to do this honestly.
help 2020-12-11 04:41:16 Nevermind, the game was just being stupid this whole entire time, I did everything right but basically the wings were still connected to the rest of the jet even though they shouldnt be.
help 2020-12-11 04:41:32 Thank you for the help everyone.
help 2020-12-13 18:53:03 the wings of my plane are too big to fit in my plot size but I've seen people use a trick where they build the rest of their wings upwards and then use a motor or such to snap it all together, how do I do this>
help 2020-12-13 20:01:44 learn to fold, thats the answer I got
help 2020-12-13 20:13:58 Yeah, just found that video too

help 2020-12-15 03:01:43 I am having a lot of trouble making this build flush and seamless, are there any blocks that can fill the gaps between these wedges? I've looked everywhere and they all create bits that point out even though I've seen people do this perfectly
help 2020-12-15 03:03:40 yeah but which wedgeblock
help 2020-12-15 03:03:51 I feel like I've tried them all
help 2020-12-15 03:04:56 wedge 1x2 doesnt fill the gap
help 2020-12-15 03:08:38 Alright nevermind then
help 2020-12-15 03:09:02 I mean the gap between them, where it looks like an upside down triangle should fit
help 2020-12-15 03:09:07 hard to explain I guess
help 2020-12-15 03:09:15 but I think I got it now
help 2020-12-15 03:23:36 they are just triangle wedges
help 2020-12-15 03:23:40 and I've seen it work
help 2020-12-15 03:23:48 they are 2x1 triangle wedges
help 2020-12-15 04:24:49 oooh total poggers moment right there
