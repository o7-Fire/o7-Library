creations-chat 2021-08-01 21:54:41 Here's the internals, packs all 12 rockets and all 10 guns because it's somewhat intended for pvp
creations-chat 2021-08-01 21:58:31 The mantlet is pretty scuffed because the rockets had to be fit there and hidden
creations-chat 2021-08-01 22:08:27 does this look better?
creations-chat 2021-08-01 22:14:55 Rockets reload in a different position, which is kinda annoying
bug-reports 2021-08-01 22:16:59 Rockets reload misaligned
