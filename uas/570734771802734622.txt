bug-reports 2021-08-29 04:23:33 well the problem is that this shouldn't happen. when a person leaves the game, their build should despawn. the bug is that it doesnt

creations-chat 2021-09-27 00:47:14 didnt realize what was wrong, thats all
bug-reports 2021-09-27 03:04:17 OKAY CAN WE FIX THE GODDAMN BUG WITH MOTOR 2 SERVO SET TO 180° MAX ANGLE NOT ROTATING THE RIGHT WAY? IT WILL WORK HALF THE TIME AND THEN DECIDES TO ROTATE THE OPPOSITE WAY DESPITE NOT HAVING CHANGED THE SETTINGS
bug-reports 2021-09-27 03:05:17 this has been reported multiple times in the past and nothing has been done about it
bug-reports 2021-09-27 03:19:52 if this isnt fixed in like a week
bug-reports 2021-09-27 03:19:55 imma ping someone
bug-reports 2021-09-27 03:19:56 idk who
bug-reports 2021-09-27 03:20:00 but someone
bug-reports 2021-09-27 03:39:31 what do you want me to read?
bug-reports 2021-09-27 03:39:37 that they're developing pc2?
bug-reports 2021-09-27 03:39:38 ik that
bug-reports 2021-09-27 03:39:45 but this is such a minor yet annoying glitch
bug-reports 2021-09-27 03:39:51 i feel like it should have been fixed by now
bug-reports 2021-09-27 03:41:21 obviously i cant
bug-reports 2021-09-27 03:41:26 im not on the dev team
bug-reports 2021-09-27 03:41:34 btw just link me the post you want me to see ffs
bug-reports 2021-09-27 03:41:55 im not gonna scroll through half of all the messages to see one post
bug-reports 2021-09-27 03:43:11 ah
bug-reports 2021-09-27 03:43:12 i see
bug-reports 2021-09-27 03:43:22 but i mean
bug-reports 2021-09-27 03:43:34 the reason i feel like this is a super simple bug
bug-reports 2021-09-27 03:43:44 is cuz it just doesn't follow the rules given by the config
bug-reports 2021-09-27 03:43:50 which is the direction of rotation
bug-reports 2021-09-27 03:44:11 basically, just go in, check where the loophole is with 180°, and badabing badaboom
bug-reports 2021-09-27 03:44:25 :/
bug-reports 2021-09-27 03:44:36 oh it has nothing to do with collision
bug-reports 2021-09-27 03:44:40 its direction of rotation
bug-reports 2021-09-27 03:44:55 at 180°, it for some reason gets confused
bug-reports 2021-09-27 03:44:58 thats all
bug-reports 2021-09-27 03:55:27 servo
bug-reports 2021-09-27 03:56:02 make a motor 2 servo
bug-reports 2021-09-27 03:56:04 set to toggle
bug-reports 2021-09-27 03:56:10 make 180°
bug-reports 2021-09-27 03:56:35 at the very least
bug-reports 2021-09-27 03:56:41 it flips the forward/backward
bug-reports 2021-09-27 04:52:13 True
bug-reports 2021-09-27 04:56:52 This prob isn’t how they have it coded but
bug-reports 2021-09-27 04:58:16 if (direction) = {forward}
  then rotate{clockwise}
if (maxvalue) = 180
 then rotate{180}
end
bug-reports 2021-09-27 04:58:39 I’m not an expert in lua or anything, but I imagine a fix would be as simple as that
bug-reports 2021-09-27 04:58:43 Or something similar idk
bug-reports 2021-09-27 05:16:34 anyway, moral of the story, if you've been dealing with things not working in plane crazy for an entire day, dont post anything
bug-reports 2021-09-27 05:16:42 or else you end up ranting and making a fool of yourself
bug-reports 2021-09-27 15:10:34 It’s for things that open, like a bomb hatch or whatever
bug-reports 2021-09-27 23:52:01 Mate chill
bug-reports 2021-09-27 23:52:11 Discussion’s over
bug-reports 2021-09-27 23:52:25 It’s simply a fact that the bug happens sometimes
bug-reports 2021-09-27 23:52:46 I prob shouldn’t have ranted like I did
creations-chat 2021-09-28 00:27:25 how can i hide these motors? they open the doors for my landing gear which goes backwards https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/833861220279779349/892205031938486282/unknown.png

bug-reports 2021-09-28 04:34:34 yes
bug-reports 2021-09-28 04:36:12 okay so i doubt the bug will be fixed but you cant see trails/stuff through glass, only legacy glass
bug-reports 2021-09-28 04:36:14 is annoying

creations-chat 2021-10-08 02:03:32 it really doesn't need to be custom angles to have a good cockpit :/
creations-chat 2021-10-08 02:06:05 right, but it's a custom, so he doesn't have to be *exactly* accurate. I mean, like, if you want to, go ahead, but its just a bit unnecessary.
creations-chat 2021-10-08 02:08:07 i'm not saying he can't, just that if it's way too difficult he doesn't *have* to, ya know?
creations-chat 2021-10-08 02:10:09 i wish we could get regular motors with max angles, would make angle locking so much easier <:ElonSad:573361014112780303>
creations-chat 2021-10-08 02:12:19 ah i see lol (this is why we need max angle regular motors <:pain:644301805534183464>) i know your pain, i have bad pc :((

creations-chat 2022-04-27 04:11:47 bro that landing gear <:KEKW:670310537300672528> also no angled intakes, the landing gear on the sides wouldn't go in anywhere, it would simply rest under the wings. your vertical stabilizers have a noticeable gap between them and the fuselage, and that's not a 1-block wide build if you were tryna say that, it's a 2-block wide build (for the cockpit i mean) OH also no canopy details
