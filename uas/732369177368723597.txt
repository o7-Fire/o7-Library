help 2020-08-20 07:47:38 With my railgun I have I set the magnets to lose parts only, so the magnets will only effect the bullet that aint attached to the build

help 2020-08-20 07:50:34 oh
help 2020-08-20 07:50:53 is it possible the bullet is hitting the inside of the barrel?
help 2020-08-20 07:52:55 That might work
help 2020-08-20 07:53:26 With the railgun I have it uses pretty small ammo
help 2020-08-20 07:53:32 1x1 tnt balls

creations-chat 2021-02-20 16:25:58 Opinions on how I blended the thrusters with the rest of the build?
creations-chat 2021-02-20 16:28:04 because yes rotor, it looks better while its actually spinning, and its a heli- sort of <@!705533053740777584> I will think about it
creations-chat 2021-02-26 01:50:01 Anyone want to give feedback on my abomination of a vtol?
creations-chat 2021-02-26 01:52:12 bro I can somewhat understand people downvoting my vtol but that one?

creations-chat 2021-02-27 19:24:10 <@!168586098895749120>  Have you live tested it? And if so did it go well?
creations-chat 2021-02-27 19:26:42 gotcha, did you take out many shredder bugs?
creations-chat 2021-02-27 19:28:50 If its the regular type shredder and multiple ive made a tank that can do it, granted its laggy because its armoured with 200 of the 2000 blocks on it being cutters, but ive fought off a group of 3 or 4 before
creations-chat 2021-02-27 19:32:15 Eeeeeee- yeah thats the cost of making something thats anti shredder capable, gotta use mostly 1 x 1 blocks and not too many 1 x 4 so you dont get killed quickly lol
creations-chat 2021-02-27 19:34:36 and thats assuming they dont blacklist you
creations-chat 2021-03-03 23:15:35 Opinions on cockpit? (excluding for the color, will be added later) (also the seat behind me is the most advanced communication system you will ever see)
