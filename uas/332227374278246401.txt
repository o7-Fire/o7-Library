plane-crazy 2020-07-29 07:54:11 Nice mini raptor
plane-crazy 2020-07-29 07:52:28 before i took the video
plane-crazy 2020-07-29 07:52:21 he got a hit on me
plane-crazy 2020-07-29 07:52:15 lol
plane-crazy 2020-07-29 07:42:05 Yes
plane-crazy 2020-07-29 07:24:00 Uhh my plane sucks yes
plane-crazy 2020-07-29 07:23:37 I was in pvp to see my friend
plane-crazy 2020-07-29 07:23:07 https://streamable.com/5dq8kv
cancer
plane-crazy 2020-07-29 07:21:53 Mostly tanks
plane-crazy 2020-07-29 07:21:51 But i don't use wasd in pvp
plane-crazy 2020-07-29 07:21:42 Well it's a bit too op
plane-crazy 2020-07-29 07:21:00 Like
plane-crazy 2020-07-29 07:20:58 Isn't that basically the same thing?
plane-crazy 2020-07-29 07:20:51 He said he uses the arrow keys
plane-crazy 2020-07-29 07:20:46 He said he doesn't wasd control
plane-crazy 2020-07-29 07:20:37 I told him he does the exact same thing cause he moves his plane way too fast
plane-crazy 2020-07-29 07:20:16 I did it yes
plane-crazy 2020-07-29 07:20:13 Some guy was salty about me using custom control surfaces in a plane, saying i wasd spam
plane-crazy 2020-07-29 07:19:57 Lol
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 22:44:09 I'm guessing that's moments before crash
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 22:42:18 E
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 21:30:11 What could I improve upon?
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 15:13:02 And they look somewhat realistic
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 15:12:56 <@!369303015267631104> yes
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 15:12:52 <@!289930922655088640> Try experimenting with explosive armor against shredders, i heard it can be amazing
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 15:11:11 <@!369303015267631104> Better work with an easier design cause shredder bugs and suicide bombers will come at you the second you spawn
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 15:09:52 For the nice look use conveyors
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 15:09:44 Cause i think they are
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 15:09:39 <@!369303015267631104> Can't
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 15:09:00 ***Reject cell***
***Become an Atom***
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 15:08:42 NO
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 15:08:15 ***Come back to monke***
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 15:08:10 ***Reject humanity***
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 15:07:37 Ok boomer
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 15:06:57 smh
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 15:06:56 yeah
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 15:06:33 The SR 71 Could have been faster if it wasn't atmospheric heating stopping it
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 15:06:15 big sad
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 15:05:31 In fact, all of my jets
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 15:05:25 One of my jets shake after a turn
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 15:02:43 Why do you have 1x1 wing panels smashed into your cannon?
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 15:02:03 Looks nicer
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 15:01:30 Idk what should I create next
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 14:34:14 Bruh
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 14:25:55 ...
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 14:07:21 Nice
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 13:57:49 lol
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 13:57:46 <@!645128367611445248> were in the same server
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 13:51:31 once people spawn*
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 13:51:22 Look at the video that red shredder is raping everyone once he spawns
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 13:50:50 I don't wanna be a prick, however I wanna have fun in pvp
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 13:48:14 yay pvp mode
https://streamable.com/9obbed
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 22:31:26 Once they strike your vehicle they immediately despawn so they cant be hit
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 22:30:40 idk how to kill them
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 22:30:37 these are douchebags
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 22:29:44 And suicide bombers
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 22:29:38 I'm guessing these missile spammers
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 22:28:53 What box things?
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 22:19:46 So maybe gun rounds could ricochet of the vehicle you are in
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 22:19:28 Imagine if sloped armor had a purpose <:KEKW:670310537300672528>
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 21:20:49 When you accidentaly click on the bucket
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 21:13:36 I can't protect myself in a tank against a person that has no creativity
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 21:12:53 why do shredder bugs exist
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 16:32:33 lol
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 16:32:33 My first tank aswell
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 16:32:19 I decided to make a mega tank with 2 seperate crew compartments
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 21:12:21 Those are genuinely amazing vehicles constructed by pros
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 20:25:50 What's a good color code for grey planes?
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 19:34:34 Is it okay if I don't apply for ranks? (If I meet the requirements)
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 18:58:33 Thanks
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 18:58:18 ooooh
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 18:57:57 I know that you need to use motors, but where do you need to place them?
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 18:57:21 Can someone show me?
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 18:57:18 In plane crazy*
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 18:57:13 How can a tank cannon have gun elevation and gun depression?
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 00:54:41 Camouflage
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 00:45:27 Im pretty new like I said
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 00:45:22 I don't even know what's motorstack either
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 00:42:11 ;-;
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 00:41:53 So what's motor lock?
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 00:41:19 I'm pretty new to the game
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 00:41:03 What's motor lock?
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 00:39:44 Could I fit a conveyor engine inside my JAS 39?
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 00:38:55 I tried one out, but most planes have to be really large
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 00:38:43 I don't have that much space inside my plane
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 00:38:16 Super rocket engine is the way to easily make your plane fly
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 00:36:28 oh
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 00:35:50 Not that much difference
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 00:35:17 Too
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 00:35:15 I'm talking about those people
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 00:33:37 PVP is mostly just people with anti air/ground contraptions that are heavily armored
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 00:28:46 Is there any tutorial on youtube about wedge placement or something like that?
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 23:58:47 Okay ;-;
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 23:58:15 But its a JAS 39
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 23:58:07 Looks like an F-16 in that angle
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 23:57:16 Not the best thing but my best creation ever
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 19:28:19 Does it use hover to float?
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 19:13:41 Would be cool
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 19:13:40 Wait, what if there was an option to customize wedge width and length?
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 19:12:28 Named*
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 19:12:24 Whats the possibility of a block names Triangle Wedge 2x1, 2x2, 2x3, 2x4?
plane-crazy 2020-07-16 12:03:30 Nice
plane-crazy 2020-07-13 19:56:38 Whats the smallest engine btw?
plane-crazy 2020-07-13 18:01:38 i'll test that
plane-crazy 2020-07-13 18:01:28 Without piston but i put back the springs?
plane-crazy 2020-07-13 18:00:57 Doesn't work with a spring
plane-crazy 2020-07-13 18:00:43 it might even be better
plane-crazy 2020-07-13 18:00:41 Actually
plane-crazy 2020-07-13 18:00:39 It will work i think
plane-crazy 2020-07-13 17:59:33 No, it would be inefficient to use in a vehicle, you would have to keep pressing W
plane-crazy 2020-07-13 17:58:25 I'll go into The Hangar
plane-crazy 2020-07-13 17:58:07 It actually works, however trips
plane-crazy 2020-07-13 17:56:49 I was just messing around
plane-crazy 2020-07-13 17:56:45 Can someone tell me what engine this is? (the block behind the left spring is a piston too
plane-crazy 2020-07-12 22:29:09 Hmm
plane-crazy 2020-07-12 22:27:56 And i asked for an engine to use
plane-crazy 2020-07-12 22:27:46 (I'm just starting it)
plane-crazy 2020-07-12 22:27:40 It might be smaller
plane-crazy 2020-07-12 22:27:13 Nice
plane-crazy 2020-07-12 22:26:04 yeah
plane-crazy 2020-07-12 22:25:37 There's <#478584971670454284> but this is a discussion channel so umm
plane-crazy 2020-07-12 22:24:26 What if the aircraft i'm building might be the size of my building plot?
plane-crazy 2020-07-12 22:21:45 Nice
plane-crazy 2020-07-12 22:21:15 Also can you have more engines or will that mess up the plane?
plane-crazy 2020-07-12 22:20:55 I'll look into how to build a conveyor engine
plane-crazy 2020-07-12 22:20:10 I'm not into advanced stuff, all i ever used yet was rocket spamming inside object hulls.
plane-crazy 2020-07-12 22:19:18 Well i want a powerful engine because im building a huge machine and i dont think rocket spamming is gonna work at this point.
plane-crazy 2020-07-12 22:18:53 Oh
plane-crazy 2020-07-12 22:18:32 Can a Magnetic Engine be placed anywhere inside of a plane, or any other object? Or do you have to place them to a specific location
plane-crazy 2020-07-12 21:58:52 Thanks for the tips, I will make sure to learn them for my next project
plane-crazy 2020-07-12 21:57:37 I'm new and i would need one for a project
plane-crazy 2020-07-12 21:57:19 Does anyone know of an engine that is way better than spamming rockets?
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 09:56:53 I'm gonna get bashed on by all other vehicles
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 09:56:31 If blacklisting gets removed, servers will be chaos
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 08:42:55 I might try making a propeller plane because it's slower than rocket powered planes, so it might be better in pvp
plane-crazy 2020-06-28 21:18:03 Good luck trying to find the correct color code for it
plane-crazy 2020-06-28 21:16:53 Can someone tell me how to make unique weapons? Like i saw people using huge rockets with explosive blocks
plane-crazy 2020-06-28 20:58:15 so umm
plane-crazy 2020-06-28 20:58:14 Well i just got into it
plane-crazy 2020-06-28 20:58:11 Oh
plane-crazy 2020-06-28 20:54:58 <@!541269303761174548> Didn't expect you here lol
