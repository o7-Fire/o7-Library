creations-chat 2021-10-19 15:31:46 (Day-1) Apocalypse Bunker ‚ö†Ô∏è :- Surrounding green area is a hill, the black area is the Bedrock and the facility will be done till day 4 approximately. And the whole facility will be below a layer of Mud or Topsoil (grass block with brown color) so that it's hidden.

creations-chat 2021-10-20 07:02:42 (Day-2) Apocalypse Bunker:- Bottom left, Sleeping Dormitory. Left middle, Cafeteria. Top middle, Sanitization room a.k.a Entry Room. The empty area between Entry Room and Cafeteria, Garden. The entire right side will contain the Conference room and emergency escape room.
creations-chat 2021-10-20 07:26:16 There will be a layer of soil on top of it, that's why I made the green hill on sides.
creations-chat 2021-10-20 07:46:41 BRUH this is a specially developed area meaning it has been excavated and made into a square for the facility to be in.
