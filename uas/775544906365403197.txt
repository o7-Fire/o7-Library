bug-reports 2022-01-08 18:04:06 it goes on continuously even though i go back down
bug-reports 2022-01-08 18:04:12 but it goes pretty slow
bug-reports 2022-01-08 18:04:20 but it’s very annoying when building
bug-reports 2022-01-08 18:04:48 so then why does it do it
creations-chat 2022-01-08 18:15:23 i already know i’m about to get roasted so hard for this so please just go ahead and talk shit about it lmao

the-dump 2022-01-12 01:43:22 this guy really blocked his username so people wouldn’t be able to start talking shit about him for having a shredder bug LMFAO
the-dump 2022-01-12 01:51:31 the thing is they wouldn’t know which plot was his
the-dump 2022-01-12 01:51:54 and he was walking around other peoples plots too so they couldn’t just go to his plot and know it was his

the-dump 2022-01-12 01:54:43 people with half a brain could look at the player list and if you were to put the plot with a player you’d see that power had no plot so you’d instantly know it was his shredder bug
