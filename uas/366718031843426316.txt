creations-chat 2021-02-10 04:11:27 some more edits (smokestacks and stuff)
is there anything else i should add?
creations-chat 2021-02-10 04:13:59 <@!636996526878490624> flying sailboat
creations-chat 2021-02-10 22:27:48 added some more smokestacks to really drive in the steampunk feeling, does it look good? what else should I add?
creations-chat 2021-02-10 22:31:11 also those little wings on the back go apeshit when i move them backwards into the position they are supposed to be in, causing me to revert a lot. If i get lucky they wont cause me much trouble and i'll be able to fly, but is there any way to fix this?
creations-chat 2021-02-10 22:34:32 <@!719168864705052802> theres 1 motor for moving them into the proper position and 1 motor2 for pitch control on each wing
creations-chat 2021-02-10 22:36:36 also here she is in flight
creations-chat 2021-02-10 22:38:37 <@!719168864705052802> well what else am I supposed to do then? I don't have more building space or anything
creations-chat 2021-02-10 23:23:40 added some extra sails, looks cooler imo
creations-chat 2021-02-10 23:27:51 the smoke really gives it away that shes laggy as hell though
creations-chat 2021-02-10 23:35:20 landing is smooth if you can stay at a high altitude
creations-chat 2021-02-10 23:39:40 its an airship, it doesnt really care if its aerodynamic or not, plus it isnt made to go at very high speeds (although it does anyways)
creations-chat 2021-02-15 19:10:05 contest thing ive been working on, going for a steampunk theme, dont really know what else to add but I want it to have more details, please give me ideas ðŸ¥º (will post more screenshots when SMELLY slowmode is gone)
creations-chat 2021-02-15 19:12:41 cant embed with snipping tool, gonna just post screenshots in <#384021699466756107>

creations-chat 2021-02-15 19:25:38 yeah but i want to add *m o r e*

but i dont know what to add
creations-chat 2021-02-15 20:28:27 it does fly, although I cant do anything too crazy or else it will essentially capsize in the air
creations-chat 2021-02-16 00:38:38 good idea
creations-chat 2021-02-16 17:54:02 added some guns, made some more yaw and roll surfaces (turns faster in the water now), polished a few things, this *could* be the final version (might add one or two more things but im not sure) I'd like some actual consecutive criticism instead of "oh that looks really good" even though i still appreciate those comments, I just want to know what is dragging the build down if that makes sense i guess
creations-chat 2021-02-16 17:57:51 yeah but like what part looks the best? what looks the worst? what can i do to make the worst part look better? thats sorta what im looking for (sorry if the tone sounds a bit mean, I just want some better criticism)
creations-chat 2021-02-16 18:07:15 Ill work on this next, thanks for the suggestion
creations-chat 2021-02-17 16:34:18 oh shoot my creation is one vote away from 100, didnt really expect that many people to like it
creations-chat 2021-02-17 16:53:47 awesome, but i'd be surprised if it gets any stars now

creations-chat 2022-03-11 06:19:51 for the people who downvoted my post (https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/384025409945337856/951723040742469662), I'd like to know why you didn't like it so I could make improvements, any criticism helps!
creations-chat 2022-03-11 06:27:02 yeah, it's more similar to the 70's version than the reboot version, only noticed that when i was done with the hull so i just went with it
creations-chat 2022-03-11 06:29:40 what's wrong with the nose shape, and what do you think I could do to make it look more appealing?
creations-chat 2022-03-11 06:33:24 It technically has two "noses," if you're talking about the red one it's supposed to be perfectly round, and the other one above is supposed to be pointier, which is difficult to do at such a small scale but i can try to figure that out
creations-chat 2022-03-11 06:37:41 I've never experimented with camera locking but I'll give it a go
creations-chat 2022-03-11 07:19:49 i know the proportions are all messed up i just decided to not do anything about it because i only noticed after completing the hull, maybe eventually i'll just make a new one but ive put too much work into this one to go back and fix proportions
creations-chat 2022-03-11 13:51:39 the yamato is a bit chunkier than people expect but still longer than what i made, also yes ive watched the series 2 times and am currently on my third watch through
creations-chat 2022-10-11 21:48:54 it uses magnets which shoot a projectile with a bunch of TNT blocks locked into a compact shape which i can release to spread the shot when its close to the target for maximum damage dispersal
