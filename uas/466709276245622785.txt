creations-chat 2021-04-11 04:35:57 <@!655087990418309140> I like the wheels design on your M5 Sherbert
creations-chat 2021-04-11 04:37:59 When i was very bad at the game, my friend let me copy his car, which has similar wheels, but instead of those wedges, they were half blocks, but they glitched out sometimes when it went downhill, and got flung up into the air, i think it could've been the suspention config, i'm not sure though
creations-chat 2021-04-11 04:40:49 Why does everyone think my zeppelin is a blimp...?
creations-chat 2021-04-11 04:43:12 Actually a zeppelin works by multiple cells of helium/hydrogen, so its not even a balloon, its actually a frame allowing it to be streamline but my one doesnt really copy the inner workings
creations-chat 2021-04-11 04:52:11 Actually i was just correcting someones statement

the-dump 2021-04-11 05:44:24 I think my computer hates me at this point
the-dump 2021-04-11 05:46:27 ..What?
the-dump 2021-04-11 05:46:43 Nope
the-dump 2021-04-11 05:46:46 Actually coded it
the-dump 2021-04-11 05:47:12 I used the snipping tool though
the-dump 2021-04-11 05:47:43 I used a vbs file
the-dump 2021-04-11 05:47:47 With msgbox
the-dump 2021-04-11 05:48:06 `x=msgbox("Could not copy files because NO!!" ,0+48, "HA HA!")` is the source code, only one line
the-dump 2021-04-11 05:48:55 It turned into that quality because thats the quality of the icon in windows
the-dump 2021-04-11 05:49:27 I used vbscript
the-dump 2021-04-11 05:49:32 So i did make the error myself
the-dump 2021-04-11 05:50:06 Ok, but i can't be bothered to learn a whole knew language
the-dump 2021-04-11 05:50:56 What i could just type "Make an error message that says Ha Ha! Cannot copy files because NO!!"
the-dump 2021-04-11 05:51:03 I don't think macros work like that
the-dump 2021-04-11 05:53:42 Excel is your way of doing it, writing code is my way of doing it...
the-dump 2021-04-11 05:54:06 It will come up with a similar result in the end so it doesnt matter
creations-chat 2021-04-11 06:32:05 Thanks

help 2021-04-11 13:43:55 Probably make the tail go a bit upwards before making it close in
help 2021-04-11 13:44:29 And dont forget to add turning propellers on the tail
help 2021-04-11 13:44:44 Also add some delta wings
creations-chat 2021-04-11 13:50:24 <@456226577798135808> Nice that your getting started on Plane Crazy
creations-chat 2021-04-11 13:52:39 You made me think you were just starting Plane Crazy after you joined the server lol

I like the motor locking
creations-chat 2021-04-11 14:13:24 Maybe compare its size with your character, or something else
For proof
help 2021-04-11 14:18:21 Yeah, it looks decent
creations-chat 2021-04-11 14:18:58 Hes probably building a bigger version lol

The image is pixelated so it might be a normal sized tutorial plane
bug-reports 2021-04-11 14:24:12 Well something that fixed that when i had that problem is getting a faster computer
bug-reports 2021-04-11 14:24:16 But that is costly
bug-reports 2021-04-11 14:24:39 Its mainly from the CPU being too slow
bug-reports 2021-04-11 14:24:54 Maybe upgrade your CPU and it will be faster
bug-reports 2021-04-11 14:25:20 Just check task manager
bug-reports 2021-04-11 14:26:23 Roblox likes to limit its CPU utilisation at 50%
bug-reports 2021-04-11 14:26:40 And if its going to like 56% thats a clue you might need a new CPU
bug-reports 2021-04-11 14:26:56 If your GPU is going like 95% then you'll need a new GPU
creations-chat 2021-04-11 14:27:41 <@456226577798135808> Lol look at all those propellers
I'm gonna join you and see if for myself lol
creations-chat 2021-04-11 14:31:22 I think its because expectations are quite high on this server
Don't be sad about it, you will get better
creations-chat 2021-04-11 14:37:22 Well its actually a tutorial plane but bigger lol
creations-chat 2021-04-11 14:39:29 Ik
creations-chat 2021-04-11 14:41:47 In my opinion, yes
creations-chat 2021-04-11 15:00:18 Make it heavier on the back
creations-chat 2021-04-11 15:06:42 Move the wings forward
creations-chat 2021-04-11 15:09:05 Yeah, its decent
help 2021-04-11 15:15:05 Have you checked that music is on?
(It has to at least be on client)

help 2021-04-12 07:40:42 Wedges motorlocked together
help 2021-04-12 07:40:45 No wait
help 2021-04-12 07:40:47 Wedge
help 2021-04-12 07:40:57 Wait i forgot the name of it
help 2021-04-12 07:41:15 I think its called wedge out
help 2021-04-12 07:41:23 Not sure, i havent used it much
help 2021-04-12 07:41:41 Or you can use normal wedges
help 2021-04-12 07:41:50 Depends on what kind of detail you want
help 2021-04-12 07:41:53 Smoother or sharper

the-dump 2021-04-12 07:44:10 When want to play roblox, but you see this
the-dump 2021-04-12 07:44:49 (Ik it is, i cant be bothered to actually crash roblox)
the-dump 2021-04-12 07:45:31 (Also this was real, my CPU kept overheating on my old PC causing this exact error)
help 2021-04-12 07:46:26 Idk, but i think it will look cool!
creations-chat 2021-04-12 07:49:34 Not sure, not really experienced in motor locking, would you like me to test?
creations-chat 2021-04-12 07:51:39 Ok, takes me a while to load on roblox with my internet, i'll come back soon with results. I will also provide a picture if it was successful.
creations-chat 2021-04-12 07:53:42 Finally my internet will let me load, let me think of a design of a tower
creations-chat 2021-04-12 07:57:32 Sorry, i can't come up with a 1x2 design without all the motors breaking apart, the 3rd and the 1st part of the tower links them together, 1x3 is the most compact design
creations-chat 2021-04-12 07:59:40 But i think a 2x2 design is possible, i'll go and try and make that
creations-chat 2021-04-12 08:02:17 Nope, not possible, again, i am not really experienced in motor locking, so i will struggle making up my own design

help 2021-04-13 01:25:08 Well swearing is ok in this server
bug-reports 2021-04-13 01:26:33 Well i have that problem when my ping goes high, so its mostly an internet problem i think
bot-central 2021-04-13 01:30:50 !rank
bug-reports 2021-04-13 01:35:03 I think you just need lower ping/higher internet speed and that will fix the problem, since thats what happens to me when my internet slows down

bot-central 2021-04-13 03:04:25 Wow
help 2021-04-13 03:11:33 I've seen a glitch that does that but i'm not sure how to

the-dump 2021-04-13 18:59:26 Autoclicker, i think you need to learn how to spell

bot-central 2021-04-13 19:02:05 !help
the-dump 2021-04-13 19:06:40 No, its not a virus, i coded it myself just for that purpose
the-dump 2021-04-13 19:11:42 The autoclicker that spells things wrong has updated, it still doesnt know how to spell
the-dump 2021-04-13 19:14:49 You'll be violating this rule if you do
You can see it in <#533294912586645521>
the-dump 2021-04-13 19:15:10 So probably a good idea not to
the-dump 2021-04-13 19:15:39 You can't rn
the-dump 2021-04-13 19:16:07 Plane Crazy doesnt have enough moderators
the-dump 2021-04-13 19:16:22 It says in <#623337136267067393>

bug-reports 2021-04-13 20:06:20 I'm pretty sure <-- scammer is roblox anti scam
Because i think i seen it in other games
creations-chat 2021-04-14 02:05:16 It clearly looks fake
creations-chat 2021-04-14 02:07:19 Ok, i'll say some reasons why it is fake
1. The gui is not fitted to the screen properly
2. The gui is pixelated
3. The lighting is wrong
4. Some of the GUI is missing
5. Some of the GUI is stretched out
6. Where is the roblox and chat and ... icon?
7. It shows him in build mode when the build is outside the plot
creations-chat 2021-04-14 02:09:21 Lights are available the blocks catagory
creations-chat 2021-04-14 02:11:45 I said that in 7.
creations-chat 2021-04-14 02:13:57 HA! Jetpack was available on the other one but its not available here!!!
creations-chat 2021-04-14 02:16:09 Also, his jetpack gamepass can't randomly disappear!
And the gui is a bit pixelated but upscaled
creations-chat 2021-04-14 02:21:08 Ok, because everyone doesn't believe your build is real, make your friend take a video of it WITHOUT SHADERS
creations-chat 2021-04-14 02:23:12 The friend was on build mode, thats what he said
creations-chat 2021-04-14 02:25:18 Wait, on that picture, Parachute is in English
creations-chat 2021-04-14 02:27:20 But, that picture is in spanish! on this message: https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/504436696021204992/831714828438601749
Also the slowmode is sooo long!!!!
creations-chat 2021-04-14 02:31:19 Maybe everyone should carry on the converation in <#384021699466756107>
creations-chat 2021-04-14 02:34:14 Hes on a full server, i tried using rosearcher to join him
creations-chat 2021-04-14 02:40:32 Ok i'm in the server with him to prove if the build is real
I can't see his build anywhere but i am as laggy as ever
creations-chat 2021-04-14 02:44:58 Yep, hes right, it is real
creations-chat 2021-04-14 03:18:49 Same
