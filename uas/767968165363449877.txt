creations-chat 2021-07-29 05:16:38 bro it took me hours to make why are you so mean
creations-chat 2021-07-29 05:19:23 im not the type of person to use a tutorial why are people so mean ðŸ˜­
creations-chat 2021-07-30 00:56:06 <@!738448924368568360>  https://discordapp.com/channels/384021699466756103/384025409945337856/870423767220887563 how did you do the little black dots on top of the jet engines?
creations-chat 2021-07-30 00:59:38 2 block center = no no
and if ur making a boat you should make the wedge on the bottom half wedge down 1x2
creations-chat 2021-07-30 01:09:10 if its a ferry then u should make it bigger so i can actually fit cars, also thats too flat for a boat hull
creations-chat 2021-07-30 01:12:45 something like this, its still pretty flat but i think its got what youre look for
creations-chat 2021-07-30 01:18:11 the half wedge in the wedges section of the build menu and the half wedge in the half blocks section of the menu
creations-chat 2021-07-30 01:36:02 screenshot?
creations-chat 2021-07-30 01:51:26 you should make the front more pointy and curvy
creations-chat 2021-07-30 02:00:27 just go for it, boats seem hard at first but once you get into it they're easy
creations-chat 2021-07-30 02:21:12 working on an sr-71 what yall think?
creations-chat 2021-07-30 02:29:07 the half blocks on top? you dont need those
creations-chat 2021-07-30 02:57:27 idk how to make it more point but i've made a lot more progress with it, ill show a pic in a few minutes
creations-chat 2021-07-30 03:01:16 
creations-chat 2021-07-30 03:05:29 atleast it's not the shitty tutorial people are using
creations-chat 2021-07-30 03:11:07 how's it from above?
creations-chat 2021-07-30 03:13:33 yeah not really anything i could do abt that :/
creations-chat 2021-07-30 03:16:58 its kinda hard to notice from an angle so its fine i think
creations-chat 2021-07-30 03:50:03 i usually use normal glass but legacy looks better on this build
help 2021-07-31 08:19:52 help how do i make this fold
help 2021-07-31 08:23:58 nvm i figured it out
help 2021-07-31 12:03:02 why is the map in the thumbnail pictures of the game 100x better than the actual map
creations-chat 2021-08-15 19:34:26 yeah i couldn't think of a way to paint it or fix the rotors, ty tho

creations-chat 2021-09-04 00:24:17 nothing the downvotes just don't know what a good creation looks like
creations-chat 2021-09-04 00:27:55 i think it should have some sort of gradient somewhere like from white to dark grey <@!739369649971527720>
