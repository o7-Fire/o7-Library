help 2021-03-03 18:01:29 hello does anyone know how to avoid that with motors 2 stop moving crazily?
help 2021-03-03 18:03:14 I am trying to create a 5-blade heli rotor.
help 2021-03-03 18:04:03 I was testing and that when I put less wing panels on it it stopped moving and started to be normal
help 2021-03-03 18:05:34 And do you know why they do that? because of the torque angle or is it a bug?
help 2021-03-03 18:11:11 Oh well, then it is confirmed that it is a bug, I guess they will fix it, thank you very much for the help :)

creations-chat 2021-03-30 12:46:38 I know it doesn't make it better, sorry if my writing is bad, I don't speak English I use what I know.
creations-chat 2021-03-30 12:48:51 And what do you mean by reference pictures?
creations-chat 2021-03-30 12:51:03 Should I delete it? I don't know what the problem is but if it is necessary
creations-chat 2021-03-30 12:59:16 Motor lock,When I start playing with it, they come together and I can fire more missiles.
creations-chat 2021-03-30 13:01:32 14? you are confused, I put a cylinder on each side to make it look more "realistic". Do you understand?
creations-chat 2021-03-30 13:23:54 idk I built it a long time ago, and I'm not an expert either, I have more life besides roblox, not like others..... Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯
creations-chat 2021-03-30 13:26:20 Bruh It is not to scale,
creations-chat 2021-03-30 13:28:24 Ok, nice joke? I'm just saying that I don't dedicate as much time to the game as others, that's why my constructions are not as good, and let's say I'm not an "expert". and yes im a noob
creations-chat 2021-03-30 13:30:25 Ok, I'm going to read, sorry if I broke any rules.
creations-chat 2021-03-30 13:33:42 I have read them, you mean that "controversial symbols" are not allowed, if it hurts you too much for x reason I will delete it.
creations-chat 2021-03-30 15:13:11 You don't need them it works without them I just put it as a joke, it seems it was not what I thought it was.
help 2021-03-30 22:06:20 Hello! first I want to warn you that I am sorry for my writing but I speak very bad English, I would like to know if anyone knows how to make a helicopter with only one rotor?

help 2021-03-30 22:17:34 If I do that but it keeps tilting
help 2021-03-30 22:18:40 my problem is that I don't know how to counteract the "lift".

help 2021-04-27 01:11:43 Yo, some know if i can make motor lock whit motor 2?
help 2021-04-27 01:13:34 With the normal motor it is not precise and with motor 2 it does not work directly. :/ Does anyone know if something can be done?
help 2021-04-27 01:15:06 Motor 2
help 2021-04-27 01:17:07 And normal motor, That line is very difficult to remove if you put it even the slightest bit wrong.
help 2021-04-27 01:38:22 yooo, thanks u!
help 2021-04-27 01:38:34 Very good idea thank you very much
help 2021-04-27 02:30:12 I made this system of angles, you just move the motor and it stays in the angle, now so that the cameras do not bother you can remove them with a disconnector, but with the spring nozzle leaves no trace, it is very basic I guess but I highly recommend it :D

help 2021-05-15 22:56:48 Does anyone know how to make the motors 2 not move "madly"?

help 2021-05-30 17:47:51 How can I make my rotor more stable, so that it doesn't go sideways, I don't know if I understand?
help 2021-05-30 17:54:46 Wut?
help 2021-05-30 17:54:57 Aaaahhhhh
help 2021-05-30 17:55:03 Yes
help 2021-05-30 17:55:56 I know that if I put another rotor on top of that one but in the opposite direction it will not happen, but I know that it can be avoided
help 2021-05-30 17:56:31 and is rolling to the left
help 2021-05-30 17:57:54 yes sir
help 2021-05-30 17:58:01 sorry if my English is bad
help 2021-05-30 17:58:44 It is behind the rotor but I reduced it with a balast block.
help 2021-05-30 17:59:38 Nope,it is turning to the left I guess because of the "lift", but I don't know how to control it.
help 2021-05-30 18:00:30 i can add u?
help 2021-05-30 18:00:54 Only if you want
