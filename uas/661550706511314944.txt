creations-chat 2020-11-18 15:21:56 >  jealousy i hear
<@!658318819248570381> Motorlocking is complicated due to how it depends on what design the build is. it is ok to not understand how it works. it takes many attempts to get some motorlocking builds to actually work how they want it to
creations-chat 2020-11-18 15:23:34 yeah thats nice
