bug-reports 2020-02-13 13:19:58 control surfaces dont work that well when you spawn a build at the airport
bug-reports 2020-02-13 13:23:37 got a little vid about it
bug-reports 2020-02-13 14:23:39 and now i notice it has nothing to do with the airport. its happens wherever i spawn. this is a big deal cuz 30% of all the buildings in plane crazy probably use control surfaces

creations-chat 2021-04-21 21:37:05 What is this server, i cant even downvote my own creation
creations-chat 2021-07-27 15:50:01 can someone tell me how to post multiple pictures at ones
creations-chat 2021-07-27 15:52:02 looks like a plane, and why is this cooldown so long
creations-chat 2021-07-27 15:57:17 thanks
creations-chat 2021-07-27 16:00:14 i "tried". and this is as close as you can get to 1:1. you cant make a cockpit 3 blocks wide with a seat that only 2 blocks high
creations-chat 2021-07-27 16:06:12 thx for the feedback but im not planing to make a plane with all its details, that takes way to long for me. this still is a game with limited building blocks after all.  you just have to let your imagination take over
