bug-reports 2019-02-18 16:39:09 is it just me, or is steering with wheels way slower now?
help 2019-04-18 22:22:21 hi, i havent played for a bit, but my car is not working the way it used to. it can move forward and back fine, but when steering, the car just stops. i recognize that the wheel is hitting against the block in this picture, but that has not been a problem when steering when i played before. I just want to know if this is something permanent or if it will be fixed
