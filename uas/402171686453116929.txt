plane-crazy 2020-07-01 21:12:07 noted
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 21:11:44 stay away from them
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 21:11:40 women are dangerous
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 21:11:37 good
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 21:11:26 do you have a girlfriend
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 21:11:23 son,
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 21:11:21 im glad
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 21:10:59 how are your grades
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 21:08:36 hello son
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 21:05:59 after 10 seconds
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 21:02:17 chop
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 15:11:10 ok
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 15:10:58 no you read it
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 15:10:07 and it wasnt multiple shredder bugs it was just one big one
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 15:09:58 this one was in the back
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 15:09:43 should i block him
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 15:09:18 the one that has 36 super rockets strapped on the back
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 15:08:45 they
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 15:08:43 me
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 15:08:42 them
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 15:08:33 but whatever, nobody ever changes their mind on the internet so virtually every argument is pointless
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 15:07:50 uh, no, they aren't slow
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 15:07:40 and no, when they are going 500 mph it would be virtually impossible to hit them with a cannon
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 15:07:23 blacklist abusing is what they do
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 15:06:47 and another block which is the shape but inverted
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 15:06:43 i saw a suggestion earlier of a non-pvp block with the same shape as the cutter
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 15:06:06 yes but when everyone in the public pvp servers uses them that can be a difficult feat
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 15:05:37 but yeah, i would suggest making cutters heavier so they cant fly as well at the very least
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 15:05:11 it defeats the purpose
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 15:05:05 i dont want to also die in the process
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 15:04:58 yeah thats kamikaze
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 15:04:33 me
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 15:04:24 and yes they are hard to kill when you are a land vehicle and they are a flying cutter going 500 mph with collisions off
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 15:03:55 make cutters much heavier so they are less mobile
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 15:03:44 i can think of a few solutions
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 15:02:24 i suggest using those annoying flying cutter things to be a bannable offense please
plane-crazy 2020-06-28 15:45:30 how do i know if someone else is pvp enabled
plane-crazy 2020-06-28 15:42:25 oh ok
plane-crazy 2020-06-28 15:41:56 if i try to join pvp mode will it take me to a public server
plane-crazy 2020-06-28 15:39:53 wow thanks
plane-crazy 2020-06-28 15:39:36 hmmm
plane-crazy 2020-06-28 15:39:20 when collisions are off there is no point on more armor
plane-crazy 2020-06-28 15:38:46 or cutters are so light that they can easily make flying cutters that are op
plane-crazy 2020-06-28 15:38:18 i mean if you blacklist someone then it turns collisions off, making cutters OP
plane-crazy 2020-06-28 15:37:50 is rickje ever going to balance out pvp?
plane-crazy 2020-06-22 17:15:13 wuts the water shooter thing do
plane-crazy 2020-06-12 16:30:41 uhh what happened to the button to get out
plane-crazy 2020-06-07 12:44:07 well yeah, most people don’t use tutorials to make stuff
plane-crazy 2020-06-05 15:09:57 no
plane-crazy 2020-06-05 15:09:26 ive submitted in creations before
plane-crazy 2020-06-05 15:08:56 where do i submit?
plane-crazy 2020-06-05 15:08:04 i feel like this should be enough to let me make suggestions lol
plane-crazy 2020-06-05 15:07:04 ;-;
plane-crazy 2020-06-05 15:04:12 when are they going to make it so blacklisting doesnt remove collisions in pvp? it was an accepted suggestion a while ago
plane-crazy 2020-06-04 21:29:49 blacklisting someone should not make you able to pass through them. it becomes too OP
plane-crazy 2020-06-04 21:29:25 man pvp is so broken
plane-crazy 2020-06-03 21:00:45 what does it mean if a report is removed
plane-crazy 2020-06-03 02:41:57 they should make cutters heavier to balance out pvp. wouldnt work anymore on those annoying flying cutter missile things lol
plane-crazy 2020-06-03 02:36:22 idk what that is but it looks cool
plane-crazy 2020-06-03 02:35:42 is it just me or are hover pads laggy
plane-crazy 2020-06-03 02:28:27 they never get it right though so i dont mind
plane-crazy 2020-06-03 02:28:19 and i mean it, literally every server i join one or two players try to copy
plane-crazy 2020-06-03 02:28:02 people copy my builds all the time
plane-crazy 2020-06-03 02:21:12 i wasnt even being toxic anyway, he was just mad lol
plane-crazy 2020-06-03 02:20:58 no thats not what i was talking about
plane-crazy 2020-06-03 02:20:35 pls no ban
plane-crazy 2020-06-03 02:20:30 oh sorry about not putting a report in reports
plane-crazy 2020-06-03 02:17:59 yeah, i dont think someone who watches aot would be unde
plane-crazy 2020-06-03 02:17:31 im 17
plane-crazy 2020-06-03 02:17:25 same guy who made that report said this
plane-crazy 2020-06-03 02:17:15 lol im not unde
plane-crazy 2020-06-03 02:14:44 do false reporters get warned or anything
plane-crazy 2020-06-01 17:25:13 cut a tank in half
plane-crazy 2020-05-30 02:07:59 now that it stays, builds that use cutters cant damage turrets that stay in their base
plane-crazy 2020-05-30 02:07:38 wth happened to the blacklist barrier disappearing when someone spawns in their build?
plane-crazy 2020-05-17 19:22:37 i didnt know so many other people rely on youtube tutorials
plane-crazy 2020-05-17 19:22:25 and make one yourself
plane-crazy 2020-05-17 19:22:23 just use your imagination
plane-crazy 2020-05-17 19:20:44 then there aren't any
plane-crazy 2020-05-17 19:20:18 VPN + google
plane-crazy 2020-05-17 19:19:21 hopefully so, otherwise it would be unfair to melee vehicles
plane-crazy 2020-05-17 19:18:53 must be a glitch in my server or sumn
plane-crazy 2020-05-17 19:18:29 in pvp
plane-crazy 2020-05-17 19:18:26 why cant i go in blacklisted players' plots after they spawn in anymore
plane-crazy 2020-05-17 19:15:21 k
plane-crazy 2020-05-17 19:15:03 this game seems to get laggier after the performance updates
plane-crazy 2020-05-17 19:14:36 um no
plane-crazy 2020-05-17 19:13:45 whys this game getting laggier and laggier
plane-crazy 2020-05-11 19:32:50 yes u are
plane-crazy 2020-05-11 19:32:02 i made a most impressive land vehicle
plane-crazy 2020-05-11 19:04:36 you missed the quarter pounder
plane-crazy 2020-05-11 19:03:40 some of us dont pointlessly criticize other people just to gain a false sense of superiority
plane-crazy 2020-05-11 19:02:49 wow thats fast
plane-crazy 2020-05-11 18:58:26 ugh i hate those flying cutter things that toxic kids use
plane-crazy 2020-05-10 23:59:20 I wish they’d fill in those random ditches in the grass area
plane-crazy 2020-05-10 20:16:05 chop
plane-crazy 2020-05-10 20:01:28 mmm
plane-crazy 2020-05-10 20:00:33 great now theres a horn spammer
plane-crazy 2020-05-10 19:59:06 um
plane-crazy 2020-05-10 19:58:04 but a lot of people just use them as lag generators
plane-crazy 2020-05-10 19:57:56 i use spheres
plane-crazy 2020-05-10 19:57:53 yes they do
plane-crazy 2020-05-10 19:56:58 can there please be a limit on how many spheres idiots can use
plane-crazy 2020-05-08 15:59:46 they should add a gyroscope block that will try to keep your build upright, with adjustable power
plane-crazy 2020-05-08 15:58:14 i would assume so
plane-crazy 2020-05-08 15:57:45 wuzzat?
plane-crazy 2020-05-08 15:54:11 you tried
plane-crazy 2020-05-08 15:53:38 didn't ask
plane-crazy 2020-05-08 15:50:50 chop! ok il stop now lol
plane-crazy 2020-05-08 15:49:14 two people trying to copy my knife car lol
plane-crazy 2020-05-08 15:47:19 instant kill from my knife car
plane-crazy 2020-05-06 23:41:44 ugh why are control surfaces inverted if you spawn at the airport
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 18:53:39 i kind of feel bad
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 18:52:55 2 seconds later:
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 18:52:51 my op knife car, before attacking this guy:
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 01:59:00 how to torture a physics engine
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 01:55:02 
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 01:54:45 best place to hide your boat
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 01:49:16 people who blacklist me for no reason get punishment
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 01:33:48 nice
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 00:30:36 I think it may be damping
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 00:30:31 idk tinker with it
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 00:25:02 do delta wings have the same physics as normal wings
plane-crazy 2020-04-30 19:07:36 what
plane-crazy 2020-04-30 19:07:02 i made no accusations
plane-crazy 2020-04-30 19:06:18 or look at them
plane-crazy 2020-04-30 19:06:13 hear them
plane-crazy 2020-04-30 19:06:11 you uh
plane-crazy 2020-04-30 19:06:07 you dont *feel* them really
plane-crazy 2020-04-30 19:06:01 i mean
plane-crazy 2020-04-30 19:05:34 so there are these things called jokes.
plane-crazy 2020-04-30 19:05:21 did you even look at the picture
plane-crazy 2020-04-30 19:04:59 cam?
plane-crazy 2020-04-30 19:04:09 huh?
plane-crazy 2020-04-30 19:03:54 you could just google the definition
plane-crazy 2020-04-30 19:03:46 um
plane-crazy 2020-04-30 19:03:27 thats not what an oxymoron is
plane-crazy 2020-04-30 19:02:47 why do you keep quoting me
plane-crazy 2020-04-30 19:01:18 this game is inappropriate
plane-crazy 2020-04-30 16:55:49 must be a bug
plane-crazy 2020-04-30 16:55:47 huh, after refueling it from 0 the plane doesnt move
plane-crazy 2020-04-30 16:54:29 plane ran out of fuel so i pushed it to the gas station :D
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 23:09:27 maybe 9 sped if going straight down
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 22:45:25 yay i made a cool creation
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 22:34:14 just dont be a jerk about it like others lol
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 22:34:05 il see if i can build it again
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 22:33:50 well it created barely any for me
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 22:33:41 it almost touched the ground
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 22:33:24 it was just 4 prop blades connected to a block on a motor
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 22:33:01 <@!296280922771292170> idk, motor plus propeller blades
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 22:32:47 savoic, i truly wonder how you came to that conclusion
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 22:32:08 because he told me that hiding a rocket engine in the fuselage would make it look better. put the two and two together if you can
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 22:31:36 lol veterans
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 22:31:11 because god help you if you are serious
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 22:31:02 savoic i cant tell if youre actually serious or just trolling
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 22:30:49 a custom engine didn't make nearly enough thrust for the biplane
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 22:30:38 should i say it a third time
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 22:30:10 why would i replace the propelor engine, that's literally the whole point of the biplane
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 22:29:28 also savoic i cannot take you seriously ever since you told me to "hide rocket engines in the fuselage" to make it "look better"
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 22:28:58 i dont care about extra thrust on my BIPLANE
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 22:28:12 i literally dont care about thrust
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 22:27:34 also, i dont need tips on how to make a biplane by someone who thinks biplanes have rocket engines
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 22:27:13 no offense but i honestly think my biplane is betetr than the blocky mess that is the first one
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 22:26:51 um
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 22:23:07 this argument is over
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 22:23:04 you literally make no sense
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 22:22:58 and why did you say rocket engines would make it look better if youre telling me to hide them
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 22:22:44 i literally just said a custom engine doesnt provide enough thrust TWICE
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 22:22:27 lol hypocrite
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 22:22:03 yes, i doubt you're doing the same for my messages though
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 22:21:50 also the propeller i have now fits perfectly
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 22:21:30 also as i said motors dont make enough thrust
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 22:21:12 it's a small aircraft though
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 22:20:51 thanks
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 22:20:36 are you dumb?
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 22:20:31 how does it make it look better if it doesnt affect the appearance
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 22:20:19 but his argument is that it will make it look better
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 22:19:45 biplanes arent supposed to have rockets strapped on the side
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 22:19:36 how are jet engines supposed to make a biplane look better
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 22:19:04 nah
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 22:18:30 motor plus propeller blade doesnt make nearly enough thrust
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 22:18:06 how so
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 22:17:22 because there needs to be a way to get in
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 22:16:59 
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 22:16:01 do you like my biplane
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 18:41:17 update
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 18:07:14 are they ever gonna improve the UI
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 14:52:48 I forget
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 14:52:46 was the winter wheel available in both winter events?
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 14:52:33 they bought the pass
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 14:47:15 will the flamethrower be available again in the next summer event
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 03:46:42 um ok
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 03:41:11 this spot. every train i make gets stuck here
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 03:40:25 does anyone else know that one spot in the rails where you get stuck every time
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 03:35:56 yup
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 03:35:34 tnt is invinsible against guns and cutters
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 03:35:23 they should let us cut tnt
plane-crazy 2019-11-16 21:49:57 gotta put that on my popup missiles somehow lol
plane-crazy 2019-11-16 21:49:33 that’s actually extremely useful
plane-crazy 2019-11-16 21:49:24 oh
plane-crazy 2019-11-16 21:48:44 what does motor2 do
plane-crazy 2019-11-16 21:42:24 lol sure
plane-crazy 2019-11-16 21:41:47 instead of just toggle
plane-crazy 2019-11-16 21:41:43 it would be nice if you could make anchor blocks control while button pressed only
plane-crazy 2019-11-16 21:38:53 🤦
plane-crazy 2019-11-16 21:38:33 whats wrong with discord mobile
plane-crazy 2019-11-16 21:35:45 just google it on bing
plane-crazy 2019-11-16 21:33:26 y e s
