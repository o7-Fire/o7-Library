creations-chat 2019-10-30 15:11:39 Would it be considered fine if a ship is made with a more blocky style, rather than rounded if said ship has areas which are impossible to make in the game?

creations-chat 2019-10-31 16:27:53 Is it like the skis when you have to find it?
creations-chat 2019-10-31 16:31:52 I've seen something like it,
creations-chat 2019-10-31 16:32:06 Used to make it with motors before but now I've se-
creations-chat 2019-10-31 16:32:07 Yeah
creations-chat 2019-10-31 16:32:12 Sort of a wheel
creations-chat 2019-10-31 16:32:45 I don't have it
creations-chat 2019-10-31 16:33:14 Let me guess
creations-chat 2019-10-31 16:33:18 A goose chase
creations-chat 2019-10-31 16:33:22 Just like the skis
creations-chat 2019-10-31 16:34:16 So, some people have a literal advatange

creations-chat 2019-10-31 16:35:49 Brakes yes ik
creations-chat 2019-10-31 16:36:28 I'm guessing tho that the Water wheel is better fit for paddling that two motors

creations-chat 2019-11-06 16:29:04 Not really
creations-chat 2019-11-06 16:29:26 it's literally a diff but switchable gears
creations-chat 2019-11-06 16:29:45 If he figures out a way to make it change gear,
creations-chat 2019-11-06 16:29:56 then it should be pretty easy to work out the rest of it
creations-chat 2019-11-06 17:02:51 <@!409676438682206218> Um, not really.
He could make a 2-speed.

The Dutchman is a 3-mast and yours is missing it's signature forecastle.
The Dutchman is a Swedish Regal warship, look at pictures of Wasa to get an idea of how the ships is supposed to look.

creations-chat 2020-04-12 08:25:37 I return to Plane Crazy with a WIP YT-Freighter in manly colors. Intended for PVP. (Ignore halfdone roof gun)
creations-chat 2020-04-12 08:25:38 
creations-chat 2020-04-12 08:25:40 
creations-chat 2020-04-12 08:48:58 Doesn't that cause jollts?
creations-chat 2020-04-12 08:50:31 I'd imagine turning all the wheels whilst throttle is applied would cause a bit of a shake
creations-chat 2020-04-12 08:51:20 Still possible depending on terrain conditions
creations-chat 2020-04-12 08:52:33 I doubt that
creations-chat 2020-04-12 08:52:50 Such a thing can happen to anyone
creations-chat 2020-04-12 08:53:37 With the dynamics Plane Crazy plays with, always having the tune spot on for suspension, torque and in calibration to the weight of the vehicle, it's hard to get it on the first go
creations-chat 2020-04-12 08:53:54 Gotcha
creations-chat 2020-04-12 08:54:31 I was being literal
creations-chat 2020-04-12 08:54:47 Fair point
creations-chat 2020-04-12 08:56:03 I was just asking a question though
creations-chat 2020-04-12 08:56:31 based upon what I understand, multiple wheels turning at once, even at the finest tune, can cause problems
creations-chat 2020-04-12 08:56:56 Pulling in the quills might be nice
creations-chat 2020-04-12 09:09:15 I don't if it was intentional but the floppy orientation of his legs add that extra
creations-chat 2020-04-12 09:09:17 s a u c e
creations-chat 2020-04-12 09:09:41 Ah yes of course
creations-chat 2020-04-12 09:10:06 This is what Da Vinci was really tryna do in his medical journal
creations-chat 2020-04-12 09:12:22 I mean, I get why people downvote our shit but that
creations-chat 2020-04-12 09:12:24 Like
creations-chat 2020-04-12 09:12:26 why
creations-chat 2020-04-12 09:12:51 O wait, wasn't there are heated argument about how you dont need to give a reason why builds get downvoted?
creations-chat 2020-04-12 09:14:41 You recent downvote...?
creations-chat 2020-04-12 09:14:53 Like.. the only last posted built
creations-chat 2020-04-12 09:17:39 So are we in accordance, reasons for downvotes must be given?
creations-chat 2020-04-12 09:18:54 So when is it warranted?
creations-chat 2020-04-12 09:20:22 Closest thing that is to is a yes, thus I shall take it as a answer to the former

creations-chat 2020-04-12 10:05:38 I've found that they sort of stabilize my YT-Freighter, which is a large cargo craft
creations-chat 2020-04-12 10:05:51 Could be something to look into
creations-chat 2020-04-12 10:06:14 Yes
creations-chat 2020-04-12 10:06:32 It's heavier at the back so when I descend it often tilts backwards
creations-chat 2020-04-12 10:06:40 but when i elevate the front,
creations-chat 2020-04-12 10:06:44 it stabilizes
creations-chat 2020-04-12 10:07:16 Wdym?
creations-chat 2020-04-12 10:07:37 No
creations-chat 2020-04-12 10:08:01 two are underneath the rockets at the back, at each end, then four go along the two wings
creations-chat 2020-04-12 10:08:24 So there is more bias at the front
creations-chat 2020-04-12 10:08:32 because as said, most of the weight is at the back

creations-chat 2020-04-15 15:44:26 Also, <@!608669316178509825> It's not a carrier of sorts
creations-chat 2020-04-15 15:44:47 It's more akin to a base
creations-chat 2020-04-15 15:44:54 Doesn't fit actual planes on it
creations-chat 2020-04-15 15:45:14 Best it can do for is light fighters and vertical take-off aircraft
creations-chat 2020-04-15 15:45:16 ik cri
creations-chat 2020-04-15 15:45:27 But I'm not yet daring to hop on the carrier thing

Are you going for the 68’? 
The fastback portion is sloping too much towards the front. As a whole, it’s unnecessarily tall. 
try and use more of the half blocks
