help 2019-10-14 03:35:26 It would of been a monoplane if hadn't for the fact it turns to the side uncontrollable so the wings had to be close

creations-chat 2020-08-26 03:27:51 I am getting a video of the flashbang in action
creations-chat 2020-08-26 03:29:11 
creations-chat 2020-08-26 03:31:28 are you blinded now
creations-chat 2020-08-26 03:31:34 it really hurts my eyes
creations-chat 2020-08-26 21:47:37 whirleybird
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:08:04 I'd recommend you make the front better
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:08:48 like
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:08:52 Its kinda weirdly shaped
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:08:58 Its not smooth like a real ships
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:09:07 Real ships don't have bumps all over the front
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:09:13 oh
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:09:18 why?
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:09:38 ok
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:11:30 oh
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:12:51 I wish ships could sink by them self if they were damaged too badly
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:13:18 because it just looks weird for a ship that is split in half to still be floating
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:13:44 Like sure, the SS Pentleton existed, but it eventually sunk
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:14:09 Pendleton*
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:14:29 
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:16:39 ?
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:17:21 and they spam 12 shredder bugs
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:18:52 1st phase: turret, rocket and gun spam
2nd phase: stick planes with spammed guns
3rd phase: shredder bugs
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:19:55 I didn't go into pvp for while when I was noob
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:21:12 My noob phases were more like
1st phase: stick planes
2nd phase: Planes that aren't stick planes but still suck
3rd phase: experimenting with making gun systems
4th phase: experimenting with using keyboard controls to use control panel more reliably
5th phase: experimenting with motor engines
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:22:29 I am great at making motor engines tbh
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:22:40 and I love motor engines
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:22:52 because I don't have to spam super rocket engines and it isn't earrape
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:23:01 And motor engines look good and can go fast
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:23:37 oh wait I skipped a phase
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:24:18 1st phase: stick planes
2nd phase: Planes that aren't stick planes but still suck
3rd phase: experimenting with making gun systems
4th phase: experimenting with using keyboard controls to use control panel more reliably
5th phase: experimenting with motor engines
6th phase: experimenting with motor engines on ships
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:24:50 my motor engine phase was also really fun
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:25:22 I'm actually pretty sad that I deleted my first prototypes of my motor planes :C
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:26:09 I do actually have a better version of the prototype that is bigger
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:26:24 but I don't use it since its a bomber
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:26:47 yeah
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:27:25 I wish you could whitelist people so they could control pilot seats and you could select what that pilot seat controls
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:27:57 So you wouldn't just have a massive battleship crewed by one single person
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:28:21 Then you could select if they could build on your plot or not
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:29:45 Honestly some people say my stuff is crap and looks horrible
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:29:56 But I like to focus on function more than looks
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:30:30 In my opinion, one problem with people in plane crazy are that they focus more on looks
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:31:09 that isn't a real motor engine.. *gasp*
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:32:38 ?
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:32:56 <@456226577798135808> wdym by that
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:33:36 wdym...
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:33:43 Do you mean motors or engines
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:34:08 *motor* propeller engine or the default propeller engine that you can place down without work
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:34:56 I don't use propeller engines
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:35:04 I use MOTOR engines
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:35:19 that isn't a motor engine though
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:35:27 I see the fake props
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:35:33 So it can't move forward
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:35:39 As those are blocks
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:35:43 Not the propeller blades
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:36:05 ?
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:36:30 Wanna know why the propeller blades made the plane slower?
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:36:42 You built it wrong.
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:36:47 How many motors did you put
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:38:27 I'm bad at design but great at function
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:38:48 ?
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:39:02 you are talking about propeller engines I believe
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:40:15 Also an ideal plane with a motor engine has 2 engines so it won't be in a barrel roll forever
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:40:34 I have made motor planes with 1 engine before
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:40:55 They are pretty slow though since you can't put enough motors into them and they require alot of ballast to ballance
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:41:20 But if you have a 2 engine motor plane then you don't have to balance it as long as you know how to do it
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:41:57 Also I've found that if the motor engine is too fast then it will glitch out and you will need to put rods infront to stabilize
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:42:13 Ok
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:44:06 If you ever use motor engines, don't make your plane single engine
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:44:33 I dislike it when people use the prop blades for cosmetics tbh
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:44:49 btw this isn't related to the argument
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:45:21 Does it work?
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:45:30 nice
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:46:02 oh yeah that reminds me
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:46:13 On my first prototype motor engine plane
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:46:19 It had a EMP device
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:46:49 When it when close to something that had a magnet, it just did weird stuff to them
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:47:23 well
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:47:31 I mean that it was LIKE an EMP
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:47:59 notice I said like
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:48:09 yep
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:48:30 this was in 2017 btw
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:48:45 I only tested it on a helicopter that had a magnet though
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:49:13 both our magnets were on, and it basically just made it do really weird stuff and spaz out
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:49:27 so yeah
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:49:40 we had magnets only on aswell
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:49:52 I know
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:50:23 ?
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:50:42 > Also magnets are really laggy
saying it like this made it sound like it was directed at me
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:51:14 I think magnets and ropes don't go well together
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:52:18 Its ugly, big, probably doesn't work well, and I see you use the propeller blades as cosmetics and that makes me mad
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:53:46 Also
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:53:48 Another thing
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:53:51 You self upvoted
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:53:52 NOT COOL
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:53:57 SELF UPVOTING IS NOT COOL
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:54:18 
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:54:25 lol
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:54:34 I already have the evidence...
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:55:26 <@456226577798135808>
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:55:30 Convert it to a Mp4
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:55:46 Same
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:59:00 what the hell... that helicopter though...
creations-chat 2020-08-27 19:04:54 Pretty sure we're not the toxic pieces of crap <@!579461045391851520>
creations-chat 2020-08-27 19:05:04 nah
creations-chat 2020-08-27 19:05:10 It says he and his alt are still here
creations-chat 2020-08-27 19:05:30 yeah theres 2 of them
creations-chat 2020-08-27 19:05:40 <@!579461045391851520>  and <@!710152374013919273>
creations-chat 2020-08-27 19:06:21 Tbh I can tell that helicopter doesn't function well either
creations-chat 2020-08-27 19:06:37 Its literally about to spiral in the pic
creations-chat 2020-08-27 19:08:16 wut
creations-chat 2020-08-27 19:08:26 meh
creations-chat 2020-08-27 19:08:34 ok
creations-chat 2020-08-27 19:08:43 Honest the wings in plane crazy are horrible
creations-chat 2020-08-27 19:08:47 They are like paper thin
creations-chat 2020-08-27 19:09:06 But I take pride in not spamming rocket engines atleast
creations-chat 2020-08-27 19:09:32 800 speed
creations-chat 2020-08-27 19:09:44 I let my brother copy and he made a version that could go 1200
creations-chat 2020-08-27 19:09:52 But by the the time it reached 1200 it broke
creations-chat 2020-08-27 19:10:47 The plane I made is stable and manverable
creations-chat 2020-08-27 19:10:59 and durable
creations-chat 2020-08-27 19:11:03 it can fly without the tail
creations-chat 2020-08-27 19:11:21 And it can also fly with very little wing section left
creations-chat 2020-08-27 19:11:37 also I deleted it so no one would copy
creations-chat 2020-08-27 19:12:13 (I deleted the pic not the actual plane)
creations-chat 2020-08-27 19:12:37 yeah better safe than sorry tbh
creations-chat 2020-08-27 19:12:58 Also flashbang
creations-chat 2020-08-27 19:13:53 You know the plane crazy tutorial youtuber point?
creations-chat 2020-08-27 19:14:05 I think he changed his name to Pointy though
creations-chat 2020-08-27 19:14:09 oh

creations-chat 2020-08-27 19:32:18 he probably wasn't 13+ anyways
creations-chat 2020-08-27 19:32:30 Anyone with those insults obviously aren't older than 13
creations-chat 2020-08-27 19:32:33 soooo yeah

creations-chat 2020-08-27 19:35:08 please stop being a TOXIC LITTLE PEICE OF ROTTEN MODLY BLENDED HAM LEEFT INSIDE OF A COOLER FULL OF CRAP!!!
creations-chat 2020-08-27 19:38:13 (joke)
bot-central 2020-08-27 19:47:48 !suggest Decal blocks
creations-chat 2020-08-27 19:52:28 Tbh I dislike the map
creations-chat 2020-08-27 19:52:43 I know it would be hard to make a new map, but the current map looks awful
creations-chat 2020-08-27 19:52:55 Its pretty bland too
creations-chat 2020-08-27 19:53:03 Not enough water either
creations-chat 2020-08-27 19:53:34 A river leading into a lake would be cool
creations-chat 2020-08-27 19:53:56 He said it was his first
creations-chat 2020-08-27 19:54:18 also imagine if there were trees on the map
creations-chat 2020-08-27 19:54:25 Or weather
creations-chat 2020-08-27 19:55:26 The map honestly needs to be bigger, better looking, less bland, and more variation
creations-chat 2020-08-27 19:55:39 In roblox studio theres actually a tool that generates a map for you
creations-chat 2020-08-27 19:56:24 If there was something like a river that divided the map, people would have to make vehicles that could cross it, but probably a bridge would be better
creations-chat 2020-08-27 19:56:39 Also if there was a bigger ocean
creations-chat 2020-08-27 19:56:45 Then it would be more fun
creations-chat 2020-08-27 19:57:23 When you got a big ship that is literally the size of the ocean, its really annoying not being able to go anywhere because that
creations-chat 2020-08-27 19:59:16 I feel like ships, and cars were kinda overlooked
creations-chat 2020-08-27 19:59:27 waves would be nice
creations-chat 2020-08-27 20:00:01 yep
creations-chat 2020-08-27 20:00:14 I kinda made NVG
creations-chat 2020-08-27 20:00:43 its not good though
creations-chat 2020-08-27 20:04:06 I'ma make a map to show what I think would be an ideal map
creations-chat 2020-08-27 20:05:22 Obviously my map isn't gonna be added, but after all its only to show my thoughts
creations-chat 2020-08-27 21:01:55 also
creations-chat 2020-08-27 21:02:00 If motor 2s are spazing out
creations-chat 2020-08-27 21:02:07 theres an easy fix
creations-chat 2020-08-27 21:02:14 But yeah
creations-chat 2020-08-27 21:02:16 Also
creations-chat 2020-08-27 21:02:21 If you could attach things to wheels
creations-chat 2020-08-27 21:02:26 why not use motor 1s
creations-chat 2020-08-27 21:02:36 Since you'd have to press buttons to turn the wheel
creations-chat 2020-08-27 21:03:00 for me the fix for my turrets was that I just reduced the max angle
creations-chat 2020-08-27 21:03:11 besides the bottom motor anyways
creations-chat 2020-08-27 21:03:21 also if its too heavy it does that
creations-chat 2020-08-27 21:03:40 magnets
creations-chat 2020-08-27 21:03:46 not sure if magnets still work anymore
creations-chat 2020-08-27 21:04:09 they used to
creations-chat 2020-08-27 21:06:31 great
creations-chat 2020-08-27 21:08:19 Btw
creations-chat 2020-08-27 21:08:25 cave systems would be epic
creations-chat 2020-08-28 01:01:46 any ideas how to improve my tankette?

creations-chat 2020-09-01 21:10:58 I'ma make an ironclad
creations-chat 2020-09-01 21:14:11 You would have to make a super lag machine
creations-chat 2020-09-01 21:14:21 then save it in all of your saveslots
creations-chat 2020-09-01 23:08:09 Might be a butthurt person who you downvoted
bug-reports 2020-09-02 16:15:02 You can make the numbers bigger, but the color is capped at 255.

creations-chat 2020-09-02 16:18:14 The ship is too topheavy
creations-chat 2020-09-02 16:18:29 And the body of the ship is too thin

creations-chat 2020-09-02 16:19:01 The body of the ship
creations-chat 2020-09-02 16:19:20 Also you see how the cabin is high up
creations-chat 2020-09-02 16:19:36 The cabin is adding weight to the top of the ship
creations-chat 2020-09-02 16:19:44 And gravity wants the weight to be on the bottom
creations-chat 2020-09-02 16:19:59 So it tips like that
creations-chat 2020-09-02 16:20:07 Clearly not.
creations-chat 2020-09-02 16:20:22 I can make a 2k block ship in around 30 minutes to an hour
creations-chat 2020-09-02 16:20:46 I don't know how someone would spend 2 days making a ship though
creations-chat 2020-09-02 16:21:15 Learn from experience to help make your ship
creations-chat 2020-09-02 16:21:49 Yeah.
creations-chat 2020-09-02 16:22:09 Yeah I feel learning from experience would be better
creations-chat 2020-09-02 16:22:13 because you don't understand
creations-chat 2020-09-02 16:22:38 That the BODY of the ship is too thin
creations-chat 2020-09-02 16:23:37 Basically, just experiment and learn from experience.
creations-chat 2020-09-02 16:23:59 Wait
creations-chat 2020-09-02 16:24:04 How does the ship turn?
creations-chat 2020-09-02 16:24:09 What is it's turning system
creations-chat 2020-09-02 16:24:13 That might be a problem
creations-chat 2020-09-02 16:24:34 -_-
creations-chat 2020-09-02 16:24:37 Really...
creations-chat 2020-09-02 16:25:09 Tbh, I hate using sideways engines to turn
creations-chat 2020-09-02 16:25:42 Eh. I just don't like making my ship earrape
creations-chat 2020-09-02 16:27:01 Ok, basically just don't expect to instantly know everything, learning from experience takes time.
creations-chat 2020-09-02 16:28:50 I haven't seen many people make ironclads
creations-chat 2020-09-02 16:29:35 I don't really like to make ships based off real life ships
creations-chat 2020-09-02 16:31:11 Tip. Don't make your ship's armor 1 block thin. ACTUALLY GIVE IT ARMOR. If you use it in PVP anyways.

creations-chat 2020-09-17 16:40:37 But yours are clearly floating...
creations-chat 2020-09-17 16:40:45 And I'm asking WHY they are floating...
creations-chat 2020-09-17 16:41:17 Yeah
creations-chat 2020-09-17 16:41:30 They are floating
creations-chat 2020-09-17 16:41:41 No I'm saying

creations-chat 2020-09-17 16:42:28 I just said it was a different person
creations-chat 2020-09-17 16:42:46 Yeah I know
creations-chat 2020-09-17 16:42:50 > It was a different person
creations-chat 2020-09-17 16:42:51 See
creations-chat 2020-09-17 16:42:58 Because I looked up
creations-chat 2020-09-17 16:43:03 But you made it sound like it was yours
creations-chat 2020-09-17 16:44:02 I already said they weren't yours though
creations-chat 2020-09-17 16:44:07 So why are you still arguing
creations-chat 2020-09-17 16:44:27 Yeah might want to read
creations-chat 2020-09-17 16:44:43 What I just said right above 
> So why are you still arguing
creations-chat 2020-09-17 16:45:11 Because I CLEARLY didn't understand it wasn't yours
creations-chat 2020-09-17 16:45:40 Basically
creations-chat 2020-09-17 16:45:43 Just place ballast
creations-chat 2020-09-17 16:45:47 Use screwdriver
creations-chat 2020-09-17 16:45:50 Yeah
creations-chat 2020-09-17 16:45:52 Ballast is weight
creations-chat 2020-09-17 16:46:12 > I already said they weren't yours though
Don't see how I just said it was yours when I just said it wasn't yours
creations-chat 2020-09-17 16:46:55 Ballast is basically a weight block
help 2020-09-18 03:45:37 <@!684107544008196187>  That train is absolute shit

creations-chat 2020-09-18 16:59:52 Hey uh diamond fire
creations-chat 2020-09-18 17:00:01 My plane can fly upsidedown too
creations-chat 2020-09-18 17:00:05 It uses control panels
creations-chat 2020-09-18 17:00:30 Literally all planes can fly upsidedown
creations-chat 2020-09-18 17:00:48 Not clicking that
creations-chat 2020-09-18 17:08:58 Those are all massive, probably slow, weird looking, easy target, and hidious
creations-chat 2020-09-18 17:10:21 Still are hidious, big, easy target, and probably slow
creations-chat 2020-09-18 17:11:05 Mine goes 700 and is very maneuverable and durable
creations-chat 2020-09-18 17:12:16 yeah
creations-chat 2020-09-18 17:12:41 also, why have big bombs when you can have MANY tiny bombs
creations-chat 2020-09-18 17:12:49 Its the HE111z
creations-chat 2020-09-18 17:13:25 For short its HE111z
creations-chat 2020-09-18 17:14:25 I just paint mine white and say its winter camo
creations-chat 2020-09-18 17:14:33 I think white looks good on my planes
creations-chat 2020-09-18 17:14:52 Then I like to make the very tip of the nose black
creations-chat 2020-09-18 17:18:02 I like making interceptors
creations-chat 2020-09-18 17:18:10 Mine doesn't
creations-chat 2020-09-18 17:18:17 The missiles always hit my plane
creations-chat 2020-09-18 17:20:25 Nice!
creations-chat 2020-09-18 17:20:31 A motorpowered plane in creations for once
creations-chat 2020-09-18 17:20:46 yeah I just never see any
help 2020-09-18 19:19:49 gee I wonder why -_-
help 2020-09-18 21:04:57 I may not be a *rocket scientist*, ||pun intended|| but that don't look right to me chief
bug-reports 2020-09-19 19:25:05 I don't see them exploding though
bug-reports 2020-09-19 19:25:23 oki
creations-chat 2020-09-21 15:35:12 I like the plane, its just something about it doesn't seem right to me
creations-chat 2020-09-21 15:35:23 I think its the color
creations-chat 2020-09-21 15:35:32 And the fact its oversized
creations-chat 2020-09-21 15:36:03 wut
creations-chat 2020-09-21 15:36:20 That plane right there doesn't seem oversized
creations-chat 2020-09-21 15:36:28 That isn't a very good size comparison
creations-chat 2020-09-21 15:37:35 From what I see it is 3-4 blocks tall, and 3 blocks wide on the fuselage (the jet)
creations-chat 2020-09-21 15:37:55 3-6 wide*
creations-chat 2020-09-21 15:38:20 Tbh, big things don't mean better imo
creations-chat 2020-09-21 15:39:54 Yeah
creations-chat 2020-09-21 15:41:41 3 things I hate:
Rocket spam
Oversized things that don't need to be oversized (including the MASSIVE cars people make)
"My build is so good why did you downvote" (when the build is genuinely bad)
creations-chat 2020-09-21 15:42:41 2.5 to 3 blocks tall I see
creations-chat 2020-09-21 15:42:52 Its decent looking
creations-chat 2020-09-21 15:43:09 cockpit is kinda spikey
creations-chat 2020-09-21 15:43:27 whats the speed of it?
creations-chat 2020-09-21 15:43:41 Decent PVP speed I guess
creations-chat 2020-09-21 15:44:22 Helium is for nubs
creations-chat 2020-09-21 15:45:21 then don't upvote OR downvote it
creations-chat 2020-09-21 15:45:46 what about the bren gun
creations-chat 2020-09-21 15:46:48 I dislike the use of tutorials, but I'm fine with using it just to learn how to make CERTAIN stuff you may know how to, for example, tank tracks, hover engine, conveyor engines, etc
creations-chat 2020-09-21 15:47:00 Just not whole planes, only little components
creations-chat 2020-09-21 15:47:28 yeah
creations-chat 2020-09-21 15:47:37 tbh whats the point of making a tutorial plane
creations-chat 2020-09-21 15:47:44 Most of them aren't good in PVP or anything
creations-chat 2020-09-21 15:47:59 And you don't get to brag when you make a tutorial plane
creations-chat 2020-09-21 15:48:03 Since people call you out on it
creations-chat 2020-09-21 15:48:44 Tbh I've only watched a tutorial once or twice, for how to make tank tracks and conveyor engines lol
creations-chat 2020-09-21 15:50:45 Tbh I dislike trollgenious
creations-chat 2020-09-21 15:51:01 trollgenius*
creations-chat 2020-09-21 15:51:14 oofergaming
creations-chat 2020-09-21 15:51:15 No
creations-chat 2020-09-21 15:51:28 That would not work as a bomber OR an interceptor
creations-chat 2020-09-21 15:51:41 Interceptors have to be fast, to intercept the enemy
creations-chat 2020-09-21 15:51:48 Bombers have to carry many bombs
creations-chat 2020-09-21 15:52:51 Yeah probably still wouldn't work as an interceptor
creations-chat 2020-09-21 15:53:00 Oofer you might wanna step up your game a bit.
creations-chat 2020-09-21 15:55:47 Oofer show me pls

creations-chat 2020-09-21 15:57:22 Yeah
creations-chat 2020-09-21 15:57:25 That looks amazing
creations-chat 2020-09-21 15:57:52 oofer 360 is not fast enough to be an interceptor...
creations-chat 2020-09-21 15:58:11 stickplanes can sorta go faster than 360
creations-chat 2020-09-21 15:59:09 iaboyk you are going to get alot of upvotes
creations-chat 2020-09-21 15:59:42 yeah but probably there is going to be one toxic kid who can't make something that good, so they downvote it.
creations-chat 2020-09-21 15:59:59 how maneuvrable

creations-chat 2020-09-21 16:30:12 Oofer
creations-chat 2020-09-21 16:30:31 Oofer use the little tiny wedges for the gaps
creations-chat 2020-09-21 16:30:38 forgot what they were called
creations-chat 2020-09-21 16:30:49 I think they are in wedges, wedge2, or half blocks

creations-chat 2020-10-02 16:40:58 I have a big boat that takes up most of my plot

Its only 1.7k or 2.7k blocks can't remember
creations-chat 2020-10-02 16:41:14 Yet that sailboat somehow takes up 2k blocks
creations-chat 2020-10-02 16:41:31 Its visibly not 2k blocks.
creations-chat 2020-10-02 16:44:19 They are connected by a bridge
creations-chat 2020-10-02 16:44:37 the 2 boats are connected
creations-chat 2020-10-02 16:45:06 Yeah but its probably not 2k blocks
creations-chat 2020-10-02 16:46:23 Guessing you used all 1x1 blocks, and spammed blocks inside
creations-chat 2020-10-02 16:47:41 does it capsize easily, turn well, and have a decent speed?
creations-chat 2020-10-02 16:50:50 that bote make me mad lol
creations-chat 2020-10-02 19:52:49 I have a odd plane that is kind of a mix of a Beaufighter, F7F Tigercat, and Henschel HS129
creations-chat 2020-10-02 19:53:44 Its most similar to the beaufighter though
creations-chat 2020-10-02 20:02:24 His name is Dell

creations-chat 2020-10-05 17:16:32 I just wanna mount it on my heavy fighter motor plane so it could be a tank buster like the HS 129 with the 75mm gun
creations-chat 2020-10-05 17:16:50 Dis bad boi
creations-chat 2020-10-05 17:17:13 Apparently it could barely fly due to bad engines and the sheer weight of the gun
creations-chat 2020-10-05 17:17:53 Suggestion 7409 is good, except I think reloads shouldn't be quick, maybe 3-5 seconds
creations-chat 2020-10-05 17:18:09 Uhhh no ion you weren't.
creations-chat 2020-10-05 17:18:44 
creations-chat 2020-10-05 17:19:45 I like dis suggestion
creations-chat 2020-10-05 17:20:21 I know
creations-chat 2020-10-05 17:21:22 TLDR: 20mm, 30mm, 45mm, 75mm, 76mm, 88mm, 152mm guns with reload, but weight increases with each caliber so can't be on planes
creations-chat 2020-10-05 17:21:45 Fireworks aren't that good

creations-chat 2020-10-05 18:44:00 no its a joke
creations-chat 2020-10-05 19:18:58 Well
I don't like it, and it seems useless.
Also, put some stuff it can play with
creations-chat 2020-10-05 19:19:30 Maybe give it some Jenga or something
creations-chat 2020-10-05 19:19:50 > Well

These are mine btw (jenga the game)
creations-chat 2020-10-05 19:21:03 Generally, just give it stuff to grab and play with, for example, a baton to wack people, a gun (maybe not), etc
creations-chat 2020-10-05 19:23:11 Oh wait... I got an idea! Give it a dumbell to work out to show how swoll it is!
creations-chat 2020-10-05 19:23:38 oh
creations-chat 2020-10-05 19:24:15 give it a table
creations-chat 2020-10-05 19:24:31 ez fix

Or just give it a proper arm
creations-chat 2020-10-05 19:25:03 I think I'ma try to make a robotic arm too
creations-chat 2020-10-05 19:28:24 List of things you can make for it:
Jenga
Gun
Baton
Dumbell
Musket
Cannon
Knife
Chessboard
Food
Etc
creations-chat 2020-10-05 19:28:53 Muzzle loaded gun
creations-chat 2020-10-05 19:29:57 Ye.
creations-chat 2020-10-05 19:30:13 I know how to make the gun work though
creations-chat 2020-10-05 19:30:35 Gonna make a robotic arm and gun later
creations-chat 2020-10-05 19:31:00 Yeah.
creations-chat 2020-10-05 19:32:06 What gun should I make? Double action, single action, or musket
creations-chat 2020-10-05 19:33:15 easy, just make the hand pick up the chess pieces
Well easier said than done I guess
creations-chat 2020-10-05 19:37:31 Basically for the gun I'ma make a simpler version of this, with a magnet on the end of the hammer or whatever its called. When the trigger is not pressed down, the magnet is out of range, allowing the bullet to slide up, or be reloaded. But, when the trigger is pulled down, the magnet is pushed closer to the bullet.
creations-chat 2020-10-05 19:38:01 I have a bad grade in honor science class 😦
creations-chat 2020-10-05 19:39:15 Gun trigger systems are actually quite simple
creations-chat 2020-10-05 19:42:50 play the rocky theme
creations-chat 2020-10-05 19:46:29 So uh, what type of bullet should the gun fire? Ball, cartridge, or cylinder
creations-chat 2020-10-05 19:47:50 Most likely a single action
creations-chat 2020-10-05 19:48:12 Single action or double action, probably double action
creations-chat 2020-10-05 19:48:29 (Not meant for PVP)
creations-chat 2020-10-05 19:48:51 I already got more conventional artillery that fire explosives in PVP
creations-chat 2020-10-05 19:49:11 and also cylinders aren't exactly the most accurate the longer they are
creations-chat 2020-10-05 19:50:08 So ball, cartridge, ~~cylinder~~

Trails don't change the accuracy I think
creations-chat 2020-10-05 19:50:33 Uh its meant to fire, not look good and not fire
creations-chat 2020-10-05 19:50:51 It will look worse if its very inaccurate and can't fire
creations-chat 2020-10-05 19:52:14 Damn I gotta go to preschool

It was like a really big, really long limo.
creations-chat 2020-10-19 17:16:54 > but that limo used motors to make it long and it is low effort bc i had to maximize space of the build
He had to make room for the folds, while you just made a massive brick.
creations-chat 2020-10-19 17:19:19 But its completely and utterly pointless if its ugly and useless
creations-chat 2020-10-19 17:20:41 > it is build to height limit and it isnt a brick its shaped like an cardboard box
But its not cardboard
creations-chat 2020-10-19 17:25:41 XD

creations-chat 2020-10-19 17:49:09 I wish blocks in plane crazy were smaller so I could just make something properly sized
creations-chat 2020-10-19 17:50:57 I have some 1:1 scale stuff

I don't have 1:1 scale cars though, only 1.

creations-chat 2020-11-03 17:50:25 <@!683825202609651832> Dude, why are you defending a guy who is legit stealing creations?
creations-chat 2020-11-03 17:51:49 But thats not us ingame though
You can't blacklist a person for another person
Infact, that person who owns the tank might not even be in the discord
creations-chat 2020-11-03 17:52:50 We already called a mod -_-
creations-chat 2020-11-03 17:56:49 I mean royal only joined the disc 4 days ago, so he probably doesn't understand that there is constant arguing in here
bug-reports 2020-11-03 20:00:54 tbh I don't really use motorlock, since I can just make my designs not use motorlocking
bug-reports 2020-11-03 20:01:19 no
bug-reports 2020-11-03 20:01:21 not for me
bug-reports 2020-11-03 20:01:29 lemme test if my ship still folds
bug-reports 2020-11-03 20:02:18 my ship still folds
help 2020-11-04 18:17:04 <@!559462059251859456> There is recoil in explosive blocks, its blast pressure. In roblox develop, the higher the blast pressure is, the more recoil there is. But in plane crazy since you can't put blast pressure that high, you can't get much recoil, so basically suggest more blast pressure.
help 2020-11-04 18:18:40 <@!513499940924817408> Maybe a conveyor engine, motor engine, or hover engine
help 2020-11-04 18:20:04 eh, motor engines are bulky anyways
help 2020-11-04 18:25:42 <@!513499940924817408> this is basically a motor engine
help 2020-11-04 18:27:53 
help 2020-11-04 18:28:11 basically you can only use motor engines if you plan on having two engines
help 2020-11-04 18:28:31 the motors have to spin the opposite way of the other
help 2020-11-04 18:29:01 and the blades have to be opposite of the other engine
help 2020-11-04 23:45:24 <@!565300409170919454> that suggestion makes me die inside
help 2020-11-04 23:45:45 who tf says cm instead of mm for gun calibers
help 2020-11-04 23:48:22 Juan seriously thinks that the guns in plane crazy fire this
help 2020-11-04 23:49:35 I'm doing some math rn
help 2020-11-04 23:49:58 he thinks roblox players are 18 feet tall
help 2020-11-04 23:50:12 Since a gun block is apparently 3 feet
help 2020-11-04 23:51:00 I think the guns are fine as is
help 2020-11-04 23:51:19 if I were to want anything for the guns it would be a little bit of spread probably
help 2020-11-04 23:51:48 he says he wants the guns sized down to 3 inches (I think)
help 2020-11-04 23:52:14 wut
help 2020-11-04 23:52:38 I mean that
help 2020-11-04 23:52:40 like
help 2020-11-04 23:52:44 I didn't ask for more guns
help 2020-11-04 23:52:46 but ok
help 2020-11-04 23:53:10 apparently the biggest machine gun in the world is 7 cm
help 2020-11-04 23:53:12 this man
help 2020-11-04 23:53:16 is making me die inside
help 2020-11-04 23:53:18 so much
help 2020-11-04 23:54:35 Juan is very poorly informed of guns
help 2020-11-04 23:55:16 the fact that he says CM instead of MM makes me die inside so hard
help 2020-11-04 23:56:20 the guns are probably 9mm, or .45 ACP considering how small they are
help 2020-11-04 23:56:24 yeah
help 2020-11-04 23:56:28 wait
help 2020-11-04 23:56:29 idk
help 2020-11-04 23:56:36 but 30 cm is as long as a ruler
help 2020-11-04 23:56:46 there is no way in hell the guns could fit that
help 2020-11-04 23:56:57 and this man's logic doesn't line up
help 2020-11-04 23:57:07 the biggest machine gun in the world is 7cm?
help 2020-11-04 23:57:59 I'm pretty sure hes using meters and cm instead of mm and studs because he doesn't know that studs exist, barely knows about guns, and just wants to sound smart.
help 2020-11-04 23:58:28 hold up
help 2020-11-04 23:58:36 if the biggest machine gun in the world is 7cm
help 2020-11-04 23:58:37 how
help 2020-11-04 23:58:49 HOW
help 2020-11-04 23:58:58 this guy's logic confuses me a ton
help 2020-11-04 23:59:34 I'm starting to think he doesn't know basic measurement
help 2020-11-04 23:59:55 Apparently the black part is 10cm, but the yellow part is 30 cm
help 2020-11-04 23:59:58 how tf is this logical
help 2020-11-05 00:00:32 also how are the guns oversized
help 2020-11-05 00:02:26 this is a size comparison, the first block is the size of a gun, and the second is what he wants it sized down to
help 2020-11-05 00:02:53 Juan confuses me
creations-chat 2020-11-05 17:46:37 what was it
help 2020-11-05 17:48:19 wait who was using exploits lol
help 2020-11-05 17:48:59 oh
help 2020-11-05 17:49:02 oh that guy
help 2020-11-05 17:49:09 he was also an unde I think
creations-chat 2020-11-05 18:04:07 tf that huey in creations
it has rocket engines on it and the tail rotor is just a rocket engine
creations-chat 2020-11-05 18:07:39 The huey doe
creations-chat 2020-11-05 18:09:10 why do all the builds that show a heck ton of motorlocks just randomly get upvotes?
creations-chat 2020-11-05 18:10:50 My god this birder juan guy
help 2020-11-05 19:53:14 the side with the red should be down I think
creations-chat 2020-11-06 03:58:11 tf that ironclad
CSS Virginia and USS Monitor only had one smokestack or whatever, so why does it have two? And that casemate, and that curve on the front is so bad
creations-chat 2020-11-06 18:39:55 how is that "flak gun" in creations a flak gun when it fires rockets
creations-chat 2020-11-06 18:44:05 called a Colt SAA

creations-chat 2020-11-11 05:18:29 > i can build fast but i'm terrible when it comes to creativity, the most i can do is just copy some existing historical aircraft, i'm terrible in terms of putting my thoughts onto the proverbial canvas
I can build fast and make my own custom planes
creations-chat 2020-11-12 19:11:05 that "bren" makes me so mad

creations-chat 2020-11-12 19:14:32 this doesn't look at all similar tbh. Maybe improve the stock, grip, and literally everything about it.
creations-chat 2020-11-12 19:20:00 I've deleted my first builds
Nah I just needed more slots tbh
Plus I have made things that are better than my first builds
help 2020-11-12 21:11:26 <@!665456365346488320> 
Have a bolt that goes back and forth, blocking the bullets from moving down into the chamber when it is forward. When it fires, the bolt goes back, the bullet falls, the bolt goes forward, hitting the bullet.
help 2020-11-12 21:11:47 I have an example of this if you want to see btw
help 2020-11-12 21:14:21 And also use suspension to push the bullet up
bug-reports 2020-11-13 18:33:50 seems to only happen with motor2
help 2020-11-13 18:39:31 uhh
help 2020-11-13 18:39:42 I think that they use bombs as disconnectors
help 2020-11-13 18:39:50 then there is an engine or magnet or whatever
help 2020-11-13 18:42:29 well, I am not good at motorlock
help 2020-11-13 18:42:37 But I have a decent torpedo design
creations-chat 2020-11-16 21:09:56 <@456226577798135808> technically a straight pull bolt from what I see
creations-chat 2020-11-30 18:44:55 its realy bad
creations-chat 2020-11-30 18:48:18 Scalemodeller upvoted the zeppelin
creations-chat 2020-11-30 18:50:00 why did scalemodeller upvote this
creations-chat 2020-12-01 17:37:06 Ye I saw the garlic
creations-chat 2020-12-01 17:38:39 saw this
(no I saw the other thing you sent too)
creations-chat 2020-12-01 17:40:10 also got the pic of it
creations-chat 2020-12-02 20:46:09 <@!695783576549195936> Aren't nuclear reactors bigger? Also why does the operator sit right next to it, hes getting a lethal dose of radiation I'm pretty sure, also isn't there supposed to be a cooling tower?
Where is the turbine and generator that it powers?
Also its definitely going to explode because of the lack of cooling
aaaaaaaand I'm pretty sure there aren't pipes making liquid uranium flow into the reactor
help 2020-12-02 20:53:12 <@!658829907110920192> heres a suggestion:
Maybe try stormworks sometime if you are bored with plane crazy
help 2020-12-02 21:05:26 well its much more advanced
help 2020-12-02 21:06:17 For example, this is a picture of a large engine in stormworks that I found on google
help 2020-12-02 21:06:46 Also engines can overheat, need fuel, cooling, an exhaust, air supply, etc
help 2020-12-02 21:25:43 exactly I'm helping him since he said he was bored with plane crazy so I suggested stormworks and I showed something from stormworks
