creations-chat 2022-07-09 22:43:14 the only bad thing about cylinder cabins is that you cannot do as many details inside the cabin and it is also very difficult to get out or re-enter the cabin sometimes being impossible but it improves Much the view from the outside seeing it more realistic

creations-chat 2022-07-11 05:06:03 As good as it is since I've also been through that and the truth is that what I recommend is to watch video tutorials of planes that are not so simple and guides to improve, also try to make planes more daily Since that makes you gain a lot of experience when you feel that you are truly ready, do not watch tutorials and only watch guides to be able to improve planes

creations-chat 2022-10-24 06:19:49 No, because the truth is that there are some parts that are fine, such as the air intake or the canopy.

creations-chat 2022-10-31 03:16:36 Uhmm
creations-chat 2022-10-31 03:18:45 You need to improve it a bit
creations-chat 2022-10-31 03:24:31 What you have to do is add one more angle lock and a little more width in the air intake, widen the fuselage, leave 3 straight spaces at the end of the main wing and also improve the shape of the Motor lock why there is a lot of motor exposed

In a few words, remodel almost the entire plane
creations-chat 2022-10-31 03:29:47 <@883063424614006878>  Best tomcat

creations-chat 2022-11-04 03:20:24 Esposed Loc 

I doubt that the turret is moved by the lower engines because it is 1.5 the size of the upper part, you would have to accommodate it more to the fuselage and improve some aspects such as the lock and the infrared improve them also the rest is fine
creations-chat 2022-11-05 19:55:29 <@335406521896927233>  fix all.

creations-chat 2022-11-16 05:45:42 a stealth plane needs to have little RCS and it seems that in yours that is not
creations-chat 2022-11-16 06:11:49 I'm just saying that the supposed stealth plane isn't too stealthy, I'm not saying that you have to make a plane with a lot of mechanism to make it a good build.
creations-chat 2022-11-16 06:14:47 none

Apart from that it does not have any construction role

creations-chat 2022-11-29 05:50:02 Because the glass in this livery is almost never noticeable, that's why
creations-chat 2022-11-29 05:52:32 See the glass?

In plane crazy the glass does have color, that's why I try to make it as transparent as possible
creations-chat 2022-11-29 05:55:41 I like more bright colors

creations-chat 2023-03-13 05:34:46 Is different That I don't like the color that most f-14s come with is something else
creations-chat 2023-03-13 05:37:18 Say what you want, I'm not going to delete it because someone says that making the camo of an f-22 is copying the f-22 from thrizet
creations-chat 2023-03-13 05:41:23 What do you see in the same way with these three f-22s? 
1. Scope F-22 (My friend)
2. Thrizet f-22 
3. Old f-22 (me)

My friend and I have been criticized for supposedly copying thrizet's camo when we only made the camo of a normal f-22
