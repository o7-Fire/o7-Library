The Tale of xynthesis (308346415451734027)
creations-chat 2019-08-24 20:58:33 This is my first aircraft i've built so far, Capable of a partial vertical takeoff
creations-chat 2019-08-24 21:03:50 Rip, they gotta be uncropped, k then one sec lol
creations-chat 2019-08-24 21:06:13 Here's a better pic of it, using its "Vertical takeoff" functionality, I only say its partial vertical takeoff since its wings never pivot 90 degrees to fly straight up.
creations-chat 2019-08-24 21:08:52 Nice
creations-chat 2019-08-24 21:09:11 Also that plane i made has a 382 brick count, forgot to mention that rip
creations-chat 2019-08-24 21:49:30 Yeah that's why i said it wasnt really doing an actual vertical takeoff
creations-chat 2019-08-24 21:49:53 Also, it lands like a normal plane still, It just lifts off the ground at an angle in a short time period instead of needing to speed up down a runway to takeoff
creations-chat 2019-12-12 01:59:32 This is my custom jalopy build

creations-chat 2020-02-27 16:30:29 Shame i cant lower it any further without ruining the steering radius
creations-chat 2020-02-27 16:31:22 ?
creations-chat 2020-02-27 16:31:43 It does offroad surprisingly well, It can get around the whole map without any issues surprisingly

bug-reports 2020-06-02 02:46:20 Those stupid cylinders don't even roll like cylinders anymore, Good job with your stupid "improvement", You did the exact opposite of a improvement.
bot-central 2020-06-02 02:54:50 !servers
bug-reports 2020-06-02 03:07:44 I don't see what's being improved there, I only see a new problem being made caused by something entirely unnecessary in the first place.
bug-reports 2020-06-02 03:07:56 Cylinders should roll like cylinders, Not like some preschoolers version of a circle.
bug-reports 2020-06-02 03:08:21 Try using a build with actual cylinders for wheels, It'll bounce.
bug-reports 2020-06-02 03:08:44 You likely won't notice from how heavy your build is but if you have anything that isn't heavy it's going to bounce.
bug-reports 2020-06-02 03:08:49 And the larger the cylinders the worse it gets.
bug-reports 2020-06-02 03:10:05 Literally everything that uses cylinder wheels.
bug-reports 2020-06-02 03:10:23 Cylinders got "optimized" apparently and now they're collisions aren't even that of a cylinder.
bug-reports 2020-06-02 03:10:33 More like some low poly cylinder collisions so they don't roll smoothly anymore.
bug-reports 2020-06-07 02:11:52 My build is doing it too lol
bug-reports 2020-06-07 02:51:04 This is a weird bug but like
bug-reports 2020-06-07 02:51:11 If you do the paint all with train wheels on a build
bug-reports 2020-06-07 02:51:15 They don't get affected
bug-reports 2020-06-07 02:51:20 But you can still paint them manually
creations-chat 2020-06-14 07:23:32 Oh rip forgot about that update there
the-dump 2020-06-17 03:12:24 Ok, here's one, big funny because some dude spilled his coffee on the servers that's why roblox is having problems.
the-dump 2020-06-17 03:13:38 Have fun angry mods, imma go do stuff now
