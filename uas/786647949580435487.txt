creations-chat 2022-06-18 15:15:10 I will explain this lack of detail: I wanted the fans to light up, I don't know what a front AIO or a C-mos battery is, there are fans, i am too lazy to make cables, the "ram slots" are actually the ram itself, there are lots of pcs with no psu shroud, there is no CPU cooler because I wanted it to be visually pleasing to those who don't know how to build computers.
creations-chat 2022-06-18 15:17:57 its actually a low budget asus rog strix geforce rtx 3090... ti. the mushrooms are supposed to be fans
