help 2020-10-11 11:25:13 but they are still very close
help 2020-10-11 11:26:35 its still 2 way symetrical tho

<@!555965248184778753> Where would the motors even go? Its a tail on a small plane.
creations-chat 2021-01-10 15:31:25 But ***where*** would the motors go, i get u think i should attach them to the motorlock tower but thats not helpful, where could i hide them **and** still be functional at the same time?
creations-chat 2021-01-10 15:35:40 Ok, I'm just going to presume that you think I should motorlock them to the side of the plane, if I were to do that, it would mean having to cut away 2 blocks of the wing in order for that motor to function, and that looks arguably worse than having the motor out in plain sight
creations-chat 2021-01-10 15:40:40 The fuselage is like 1 block wide that far back tho
