creations-chat 2022-07-19 19:48:12 if u have nothing helpful to say then say nothing. also, its not a floating platform, it has a hull but when i go up it has a tendency to capsize to the left.
creations-chat 2022-07-19 19:52:03 ur literally trying to advertise ur own creation which isnt even any better, its not a floating platform, it has a hull.
creations-chat 2022-07-19 19:54:28 its not a floating platform, it has a hull. like i said for the 3rd time. i can send you a picture of it if u want.
creations-chat 2022-07-19 19:56:48 whats your point?
creations-chat 2022-07-19 19:58:52 ''get good'' isnt advice, thats like someone asking *how* how to build a plane, and as an answer you say: ''build a plane''
