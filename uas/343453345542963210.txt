creations-chat 2022-05-26 23:02:06 The magnet lock in the image doesnt even make sense like these magnets that he used for the cone would be exposed plus they seem to do not have any use for the lock, magnet lock normally uses one magnet to connect the entire build or some parts of it not just a single block
