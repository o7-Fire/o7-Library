The Tale of akavanz (758441261044072449)
help 2021-02-11 17:33:50 How do I perfectly stabilise a boat, I've been trying to add and take away helium and ballast on both sides, and I've gotten close but it was still at a slant. As an aircraft carrier I want it to be perfectly up right
help 2021-02-11 17:36:19 is there a way to allow movement at the same time?
help 2021-02-11 17:37:00 hm alright.
help 2021-02-11 17:37:02 Thanks anyway.
help 2021-02-11 17:42:39 I want it to be able to stay perfectly upright while being able to move, doesnt have to move fast, I just want it to be able to

help 2021-02-11 17:44:45 Mhm.
help 2021-02-11 17:45:21 I meant to move the overall position. For example, my friend wanted to land on it, but it was at a bad angle. I could move it to a perfect angle to give him time to slow down, and land.
help 2021-02-11 17:49:00 Whenever I try and balance it, it is always slightly slanted. I've been tryna fix it for the past 2 hours ish and havent been able to make it perfectly upright.
help 2021-02-11 17:50:45 Ill just keep it unable to move for now.

creations-chat 2021-03-21 00:09:13 It's an old build, ik it's bad, just thought it was funny seeing it after a while.
creations-chat 2021-03-21 00:11:54 Mm, fair point.
creations-chat 2021-03-21 00:14:48 LOL, yes, exposed motorlock, am sorry, me change it to not expose <:ElonSad:573361014112780303>
creations-chat 2021-03-21 20:30:30 How about an f-0
creations-chat 2021-03-21 20:32:31 Yeah lol, it definitely looks like a tornado, a decent one at that. I wouldn't call that a troll build.
creations-chat 2021-03-27 19:26:25 Like I said, custom, it isn't for looks, as I've also said. It is for performance and pvp.
creations-chat 2021-03-27 19:28:26 <@!490544126606049311> I must say, it looks good! The exposed motorlock will attract downvotes for some perfectionists but overall I think it looks good, good job!
creations-chat 2021-03-27 19:40:03 Eh, fair enough, but I don't see how a very good looking build can get mass downvotes because of a tiny square shaped row/singular square shaped bump on a build, just doesn't make sense to me.
creations-chat 2021-03-27 19:55:47 I'm not thinking on working on it that much anymore considering it's old and I'm currently working on a custom Star Wars esc land vehicle.
creations-chat 2021-03-27 22:36:21 Bro idk what it's called.
creations-chat 2021-03-27 22:38:57 I apologise for getting a name wrong on a plane I liked literally 5 months ago. üò≥
creations-chat 2021-03-27 22:41:09 Fair enough.
creations-chat 2021-03-28 12:55:09 Uh oh my furry gauge/autism gauge is hitting higher then it has ever before!!
creations-chat 2021-03-31 17:39:14 <@!484067214312603660> Maybe make a crane game like those you see in an arcade, I'd love to see that?
creations-chat 2021-04-03 22:35:38 <@!714869685069283418> Your gonna keep getting downvotes, you just keep posting the same creation with references over and over again.
creations-chat 2021-04-03 22:39:36 Ngl there can be a lot more detail in there. PCC pretty much always think that unless it's already a super detailed build
creations-chat 2021-04-03 22:41:50 Paintjob, usually tanks look better on plane crazy with a slight shade of colour among the overall colour pallet. I recommend perhaps putting the entire colour around 5ish down on the Red shade Blue shade and Green Shade, contrast, then do 5 up, or whatever etc. It just makes it look more worn and torn like it's been to battle. I enjoy that sortta look, some people might not and prefer to make it look brand new, but that's my person opinion.
creations-chat 2021-04-03 22:47:00 LOL, notice how since Joshua pointed it out the channel seems a lot more calm and collected. Maybe he realised and decided to just be quiet, since he forgot to even read the rules <:OmegaTroll:626841385118597152>

creations-chat 2021-04-03 22:59:59 Oooo badman, however, there is such thing as logs. Also, this chat obviously proves that it happened, so good luck deleting the evidence in 1) logs, and 2) this entire chat from the past 30 minutes.
creations-chat 2021-04-03 23:02:28 Personally I saw the "meme" as you trying to be a comically evil villain inside a fictional comic book, but okay. <:OkayChamp:709084018485887096>

creations-chat 2021-04-04 19:26:26 How is this looking so far? It's my WIP house from up. I will finish the top half section/roof, and add an interior to as accurate as possible. I've been told in the past my colour scheme is too bright, however if you look up pictures of it as reference they're vibrant, so I only matched what the house is like.

creations-chat 2021-04-05 01:55:01 But like it is a low effort build. If he was to build that he didn't need to post it in creations, which is for builds that have effort inside them.

creations-chat 2021-04-12 20:04:25 Dang here come all the self entitled expert+ ranks! It wasn't meant to be funny, I just don't take this build seriously. I got bored and built it in what- 15 minutes at most?
creations-chat 2021-04-12 20:08:00 And there was absolutely no reason not to add "sus" in with the creation, the fact I put sus doesn't change anything, idek why you're moaning about it. I just did it because idc about the build, so what's the point making it all professional. I added it, so what? I'm done with this anyway, I can't be bothered to **be in a discord argument**
creations-chat 2021-04-12 20:10:06 Salty that what? Some random guy starts moaning that I added a word in a creation. I said I'm done, plus, no need for unnecessary toxicity am I right? ü§°
creations-chat 2021-04-12 20:14:43 Exactly why I said I was stopping. <@!720751430595772418> I don't wanna get warned, but fr, how am **I** lacking braincells, you took away from this talk that I was salty, when all I've done is say (conclusion) "I never meant my build was funny, I just didn't like it". But whatever oh wise expert rank. Now whatever u say I ain't replying I'm not getting warned from this shitshow of an argument.
creations-chat 2021-04-12 20:28:35 Yeah he's obviously trolling.
creations-chat 2021-04-13 14:03:25 cool bin
creations-chat 2021-04-13 14:13:21 Some guy tried to copy my mech legs and they just flopped on the ground, was kinda funny.
creations-chat 2021-04-13 14:17:45 But it is, creations is for pretty much just a build, as long at it isn't like 5 blocks and took 10 seconds. That crewmate is actually kinda cool, especially the fact it can run.
creations-chat 2021-04-13 14:27:26 Wait what does the score of at least 20 thingy mean, I have a mech that would let me get Expert Robotic Specialist
creations-chat 2021-04-13 14:41:09 I put a slight shade of green, and same concept for the jaw beige. It's hard to notice but still, it is there. I will try make my colour pallet a bit wider.
