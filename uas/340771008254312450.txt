plane-crazy 2020-05-05 12:47:39 
plane-crazy 2020-04-03 13:02:25 level of friction?
plane-crazy 2020-04-03 13:02:21 what material has a really low
plane-crazy 2020-04-03 13:02:15 other than ice
plane-crazy 2020-04-02 08:44:16 ima go with metal
plane-crazy 2020-04-02 08:43:56 xD
plane-crazy 2020-04-02 08:43:48 what material has the second least amount of friction
plane-crazy 2020-04-02 08:43:40 alright
plane-crazy 2020-04-02 08:43:19 tanks
plane-crazy 2020-04-02 08:43:05 metal?
plane-crazy 2020-04-02 08:43:03 which material has the least friction?
plane-crazy 2020-03-31 01:43:58 but i have no idea how to reverse engineer that
plane-crazy 2020-03-31 01:43:50 ive seen people use motors to link treads before
plane-crazy 2020-03-31 01:13:30 to make me feel good inside for destroying things
plane-crazy 2020-03-31 01:11:32 are for successfully eliminating other people's designs, without sustaining damage
plane-crazy 2020-03-31 01:11:19 every single one of my designs
plane-crazy 2020-03-31 01:10:57 10 player servers <:pain:644301805534183464>
plane-crazy 2020-03-31 01:10:44 it doesnt in plane crazu
plane-crazy 2020-03-31 01:10:30 to bomb ground targets
plane-crazy 2020-03-31 01:10:24 to shoot down other planes
plane-crazy 2020-03-31 01:10:20 depends on the plane
plane-crazy 2020-03-31 01:10:10 In plane crazu
plane-crazy 2020-03-31 01:10:00 that kind of rocket
plane-crazy 2020-03-31 01:09:57 well
plane-crazy 2020-03-31 01:09:55 what use does a rocket have?
plane-crazy 2020-03-31 01:09:13 OH MY GOD I HAVE WORK TO DO
plane-crazy 2020-03-31 01:09:03 it is?
plane-crazy 2020-03-31 01:08:48 and once that mouse guided motor thing comes out im pretty sure everyone's gonna have gyroscopically stable guns
plane-crazy 2020-03-31 01:08:18 i don't need suspension
plane-crazy 2020-03-31 01:08:09 if you do them the right way
plane-crazy 2020-03-31 01:07:55 no, they are pretty good
plane-crazy 2020-03-31 01:07:47 in my experience
plane-crazy 2020-03-31 01:07:43 way easier to armor
plane-crazy 2020-03-31 01:07:40 conveyors are where it's at
plane-crazy 2020-03-31 01:07:19 i'd say that im pretty advanced
plane-crazy 2020-03-31 01:07:12 30 minutes
plane-crazy 2020-03-31 01:07:11 given the fact that ive only been using treads for like
plane-crazy 2020-03-31 01:05:38 it makes me feel good inside
plane-crazy 2020-03-31 01:05:32 yes, and i love doing manual labor
plane-crazy 2020-03-31 01:04:41 is good?
plane-crazy 2020-03-31 01:04:37 so more restitution
plane-crazy 2020-03-31 01:04:30 or
plane-crazy 2020-03-31 01:04:16 from my point of view, if you know what that sentence means, you should really get a life
plane-crazy 2020-03-31 01:03:54 english
plane-crazy 2020-03-31 01:03:07 it legit shows me a law.
plane-crazy 2020-03-31 01:03:02 when i look up restitution
plane-crazy 2020-03-31 01:02:33 so i used ropes instead
plane-crazy 2020-03-31 01:02:29 but what i came up with wasnt reliable
plane-crazy 2020-03-31 01:02:21 yes, i tried using motors
plane-crazy 2020-03-31 01:02:02 before i apply it to every single one of the ropes that are in that system.
plane-crazy 2020-03-31 01:01:53 and i wanna know if more restitution is good
plane-crazy 2020-03-31 01:01:45 i created tank treads
plane-crazy 2020-03-31 01:01:22 i just wanna know what restitution is
plane-crazy 2020-03-31 01:01:00 already have
plane-crazy 2020-03-31 01:00:49 i have. no idea
plane-crazy 2020-03-31 01:00:35 how does restitution work
plane-crazy 2020-03-28 00:58:28 because every pleb here think's the yamato is a god ship
plane-crazy 2020-03-28 00:53:35 
plane-crazy 2020-03-28 00:53:34 i managed to make it look somewhat decent
plane-crazy 2020-03-28 00:53:31 
plane-crazy 2020-03-28 00:39:52 camo paint sheme?
plane-crazy 2020-03-28 00:39:44 anyone know a good desert tan
plane-crazy 2020-03-28 00:14:56 designs could be way smaller
plane-crazy 2020-03-28 00:14:20 I wish you werent limited to blocks
plane-crazy 2020-03-28 00:13:28 Plus it can be air dropped
plane-crazy 2020-03-28 00:13:08 it's like a clown car
plane-crazy 2020-03-28 00:13:00 this one's small, manages to somehow fit more people, but it misses the cupola
plane-crazy 2020-03-28 00:12:57 
plane-crazy 2020-03-28 00:12:09 i also got the real sized version
plane-crazy 2020-03-28 00:12:04 yeah, it's a first for me
plane-crazy 2020-03-28 00:11:41 i should probably girth up the back XD
plane-crazy 2020-03-28 00:11:25 im tryna make posty's apc, but it's going very poorly
plane-crazy 2020-03-28 00:11:24 
plane-crazy 2020-03-28 00:11:19 
plane-crazy 2020-03-19 20:28:57 i laugh at your armored vehicle that does not have sloped armor!
plane-crazy 2020-03-19 20:28:42 ha
plane-crazy 2020-03-19 18:20:45 bam tank destroyer lmao
plane-crazy 2020-03-19 18:20:42 just added a giant box on top and put a gun in it
plane-crazy 2020-03-19 18:19:39 just modified an apc chassis i already had and it surprisingly looks like a ferdinand
