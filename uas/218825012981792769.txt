creations-chat 2020-09-13 01:14:58 because planes usually aren't that bright
creations-chat 2020-09-13 01:15:09 using metal can be good
creations-chat 2020-09-13 01:17:10 its like a crossover
creations-chat 2020-09-13 01:17:58 i havent made a locked motor build yet
creations-chat 2020-09-13 01:18:04 maybe i should
creations-chat 2020-09-13 01:47:37 tanks on the top usually dont look the best
creations-chat 2020-09-13 01:47:40 so its fine from the top
creations-chat 2020-09-13 01:52:00 u can use locked motors to make the hatchet
creations-chat 2020-09-13 01:52:10 however the one hatchet i made is 3x3 which might not fit
creations-chat 2020-09-13 02:11:32 locked motors

help 2020-11-19 02:13:36 okay, thanks
help 2020-11-21 20:35:28 what's a material with good grip?
help 2020-11-21 20:40:36 ok thanks
help 2020-12-11 18:35:35 would using different types of suspension than just the suspension block itself work better for tank wheels or not?
help 2020-12-11 18:36:47 also
help 2020-12-11 18:36:54 is torsion suspension similar to christie suspension
help 2020-12-11 18:36:58 torsion bar
help 2020-12-11 18:37:00 in that how you make it
help 2020-12-11 18:38:12 rip
help 2020-12-11 20:06:50 ok so i managed to make a 2x3 wide torsion suspension
help 2020-12-11 20:06:53 it sort of works i guess
help 2020-12-11 20:07:13 ok
creations-chat 2020-12-11 21:42:55 Tiger II treads using torsion mechanic and locked motors, thoughts?
paint and look are WIP, i will build the full tank later
creations-chat 2020-12-11 21:51:49 Feedback on the tracks/tank would be appreciated
help 2020-12-11 22:36:02 this is interleaving half cylinders. how do i put a cylinder (1x1) in the middle of these wheels while being connected into the half cylinder itself?
help 2020-12-11 22:36:13 is it possible or no,
help 2020-12-11 22:36:52 i dont think it is but if im acting stupid someone reverify me for it
help 2020-12-12 00:05:50 Tiger II tank wheels, for the back wheel, should I just put a 3x3 cylinder or keep it the same size as it is rn? This is for preference and I wonder what people will like better
help 2020-12-12 00:09:58 for reference here is the tank with a 3x3 cylinder
help 2020-12-12 00:21:51 <@!621817208313479248> that's how the tiger II wheels look like, the back wheel is a bit lower down than the front wheel.
help 2020-12-12 00:22:17 <@!454809803223465984> Wedges you mean the wedges the front wheel has?
help 2020-12-12 00:22:37 what do i fix
help 2020-12-12 00:23:36 know a design that uses blocks?
help 2020-12-12 00:23:48 the problem with that is the corners
help 2020-12-12 00:23:54 well actually no those probably arent a problem
help 2020-12-12 00:24:06 ill replace the half wedge downs with half blocks and see for myself
help 2020-12-12 00:24:14 the half wedges aren't replacable atm
help 2020-12-12 00:24:23 half wedges i mean
help 2020-12-12 00:24:34 that very small wedge
help 2020-12-12 00:24:46 i will test
help 2020-12-12 00:25:44 yes
help 2020-12-12 00:26:08 apparently 20 studs is a meter
help 2020-12-12 00:26:54 a block is atleast 2 studs i think
help 2020-12-12 00:30:44 ok so
help 2020-12-12 00:30:54 currently i cant replace the treads, because the corners are the problem
help 2020-12-12 00:31:09 a new tread design is viable but i believe this one works best
help 2020-12-12 00:31:19 those damn corners
help 2020-12-12 00:31:27 hold on lemme show you
help 2020-12-12 00:32:28 reminder: problem with this tread design
help 2020-12-12 00:32:46 dude, corners appear
help 2020-12-12 00:32:53 that's always the problem
help 2020-12-12 00:33:03 wait what do you mean by
help 2020-12-12 00:33:05 redo the tread design
help 2020-12-12 00:33:10 try a new design, or remake it?
help 2020-12-12 00:33:38 it wont be a major problem if you're the only person complaining about the wedges tho
help 2020-12-12 00:33:50 that's your opinion, but many others have too
help 2020-12-12 00:33:58 <@!565165316116578324> are u ok with wedges in treads or no
help 2020-12-12 00:34:13 show it then
help 2020-12-12 00:34:28 yes
help 2020-12-12 00:34:32 i'd like to see it
help 2020-12-12 00:34:54 hmm
help 2020-12-12 00:35:49 i never copy
help 2020-12-12 00:36:11 wait i did copy my tread designs from underscorezed, but its not mine
help 2020-12-12 00:36:21 "my" referring to his
help 2020-12-12 00:37:14 <@!565165316116578324> i would but the tiger's hull will cover it though lol
help 2020-12-12 00:37:53 your tread is good, but it's quite chunky and that's also a bit of a problem if you're making a full on tank <@!454809803223465984>
help 2020-12-12 00:37:58 if
help 2020-12-12 00:38:06 my tank had no sides or stuff like that,
help 2020-12-12 00:38:12 it'd be a good option
help 2020-12-12 00:38:49 it's more smooth because it's chunkier
help 2020-12-12 00:39:55 actually ignore what i said, the reason it's smoother is because the wheels are more tigth
help 2020-12-12 00:39:57 tight
help 2020-12-12 00:39:58 *
help 2020-12-12 00:40:18 it uses the same foundation, in that the motors are crossed side by side
help 2020-12-12 00:41:08 only issue i have are those annoying dots but paint would fix that
help 2020-12-12 00:41:30 trapdoor dots
help 2020-12-12 00:42:07 but yeah paint fixes that
help 2020-12-12 00:42:09 almost
help 2020-12-12 00:43:07 well i'd use it maybe using locked motors for compress the amount of space trapdoors occupy, but for lazy purposes and the fact that tiger II treads look a tad bit more similar with my treads, i'll stick to mine
help 2020-12-12 00:43:17 you hate wedge tracks but that's your opinion
help 2020-12-12 00:43:24 uh
help 2020-12-12 00:43:30 to build around the tank?
help 2020-12-12 00:43:38 trapdoors take alot of space
help 2020-12-12 00:44:30 it's a literal 1 block of free space
help 2020-12-12 00:44:49 yeah but i'll use locked motors to reduce that space
help 2020-12-12 00:45:49 yes but the additional free space of that tread literally uses more space
help 2020-12-12 00:46:16 welp let's just stop arguing here
help 2020-12-12 00:46:40 ur opinion: wedge treads suck
my opinion: idc
conclusion: maybe
help 2020-12-12 00:58:07 yes
help 2020-12-14 02:18:48 do camera configurations (where you select cameras to point to a certain block) save? been loading my save multiple times and it seems to not work
help 2020-12-14 02:21:42 maybe i should suggest that then
help 2020-12-14 02:21:54 rip atm

help 2020-12-15 16:54:37 are there any examples of slopes like this people have made
help 2020-12-15 17:27:11 can someone tell me how do they rotate wedges using motor locks to make things like this
help 2020-12-15 17:27:19 like a circle
help 2020-12-15 17:27:23 the one with the gray paint
help 2020-12-15 17:29:42 by stop do you mean

help 2020-12-15 17:29:58 ok
help 2020-12-15 17:31:25 so disconnectors stop the motor locks from locking, but when you disconnect them the motor locks instantly?
help 2020-12-15 17:31:50 damn i didn't know that
help 2020-12-15 17:31:53 thanks so much
help 2020-12-15 17:32:44 wait are your motor locks unpowered or powered?
help 2020-12-15 17:32:54 okay thanks

help 2020-12-15 18:13:48 <@456226577798135808> how do u stop the rotating motors from moving
help 2020-12-15 18:13:52 when i motor lock they just move out of place
help 2020-12-15 18:14:10 the powered motors are locked?
help 2020-12-15 18:14:23 ok
help 2020-12-15 18:14:43 yep
help 2020-12-15 20:20:06 i remember doing that but i think motor locking is better
creations-chat 2020-12-15 21:44:11 ok so i know it looks shit at the moment (tiger II) but do you think the tank looks issometrical (turret not too big, etc.)
creations-chat 2020-12-17 15:27:49 tiger II prototype (still working on getting that perfect turret), any feedback about the tank in general?
(thanks, yeah i'm working on getting the essential parts of the tank done, then i will do the small details)
creations-chat 2020-12-17 15:31:13 i said that after he said it, i edited it, i wont put lock motors in the gap yet because it can glitch easily
creations-chat 2020-12-17 15:38:02 ik but you see the front parts right? those blocks are a bit too low for 1x .9 blocks thus causing a sticky stick, i won't remove that big gap from the turret and the tank yet until i finish the whole turret
creations-chat 2020-12-17 15:40:35 thanks, first time using locked motors + rotating locked motors so it's annoying as hell to use
creations-chat 2020-12-18 21:00:15 Tiger II 60% finished, all that's missing are details, paint, small stuff, the front and back
Any suggestions for paint colors?
creations-chat 2020-12-18 21:06:31 that's a good one but idk some good desert colours
creations-chat 2020-12-18 21:09:47 yeah i'll go desert, maybe ill make a camo green one too just to see if it works
creations-chat 2020-12-18 21:14:48 wish dev would give us quarter block
help 2020-12-19 01:59:59 is 16 roblox walkspeed (regular roblox walkspeed) considered 16 speed in plane crazy
help 2020-12-19 02:41:50 so my tank goes 5.2 miles per hour
help 2020-12-19 02:42:07 8.3 km/h
help 2020-12-19 02:42:11 that's pretty pathetic ngl
help 2020-12-23 18:59:00 So here's my tiger II, whenever I accelerate the wheel furthest to the back (it has no suspension) likes to go down even though in real life it just stays still up
help 2020-12-23 18:59:11 like this
help 2020-12-23 18:59:16 so, any ideas on how to fix this
help 2020-12-23 18:59:38 i tried super rockets which worked, but it decreased it's capability of going up through hills
help 2020-12-23 19:07:14 <@!479305807674998804>should i show you what it looks like unlocked
help 2020-12-23 19:08:38 u may not see it but it has a bunch of locked motors which force the wheel inside the treads to increase tightness
help 2020-12-23 19:09:03 it's tight
help 2020-12-23 19:10:02 your idea sounds interesting and  i can picture something in my head but at the same time i cant
help 2020-12-23 19:10:14 ok thx
help 2020-12-23 19:15:28 here's the full mess i've  created if any of you want to point out the inefficiencies
help 2020-12-23 20:08:30 <@!683847069890510887> it's not finished yet
help 2020-12-23 20:08:42 i havent done any of those small details that people like to nitpick about
help 2020-12-23 20:58:36 any idea on how to make something like this using just 2-4 blocks of space?
help 2020-12-27 02:13:42 is there a block that is transparent as in other blocks phase through it, like the gray part of the motor
help 2020-12-27 02:21:53 fuck
help 2021-01-25 15:48:32 how do yu paint signs without painting the entire creation
