creations-chat 2022-01-17 07:39:26 im saying that shipwright and terrain are the easiest to get and designer is just kind of pure luck but also some skill and also you need to time when you post it post it around crappy builds so your decent build you dont care about gets upvotes <:trollface:775024642104229898>

events-chat 2022-01-30 20:22:58 good thing i was literally just working on a bomber `that fits the requirements`
events-chat 2022-01-30 20:24:33 just motorlocc half wedge ups into it
events-chat 2022-01-30 20:27:04 no we can only make fard bombers
events-chat 2022-01-30 20:27:42 sigh how do you make a small bomber anyways lol wheres the fun in that
events-chat 2022-01-30 20:29:11 yes ik
events-chat 2022-01-30 20:29:43 but small bombers are boring
even twin engines are boring unless large like he 177 or something with a large wingspan
events-chat 2022-01-30 20:33:19 actually i almost used that as my example instead of he 177
such a nice plane
events-chat 2022-01-30 20:34:04 its kind of fun sometimes
events-chat 2022-01-30 20:35:01 especially my three fold zeppelin that everyone underestimates then cant hurt because it has blast proof everything and still looks like it doesnt

ok i didnt make it no see why did it do that
events-chat 2022-01-30 20:35:18 real life or plane crazy
events-chat 2022-01-30 20:36:32 indeed

events-chat 2022-01-30 20:45:18 it could have gone so much worse this server is chaos
events-chat 2022-01-30 20:45:47 bruh no anchors?
events-chat 2022-01-30 20:46:05 all my planes work in pvp and also looks pretty fine using angle locks and such
events-chat 2022-01-30 20:49:35 its so true
i was fighting this guy he was missing a whole wing, had half another, no tail (i shot it off right behind the cockpit) and he still flew perfectly
vulpens b17 looks like vomit but flies well under heavy damage
events-chat 2022-01-30 20:50:39 indeed he did
creations-chat 2022-01-30 20:52:28 reactn't
events-chat 2022-01-30 20:52:41 because they use no skill builds for tuts
events-chat 2022-01-30 20:53:30 they probably either make it on the spot <:trollface:775024642104229898> or they cut out the parts in the video where they look at the build
events-chat 2022-01-30 20:54:38 great now that im thinking of vulpen bomber i really want to make a lancaster (or halifax or lincoln or stirling)
events-chat 2022-01-30 20:56:42 i used to have a stirling but slapped it out of my saved files
events-chat 2022-01-30 20:57:15 yes i know but i cant see what it lands like because you havent showed lol and also your explanation is not great
events-chat 2022-01-30 20:57:36 i havent played that but i might now
events-chat 2022-01-30 20:58:03 oh
events-chat 2022-01-30 20:58:57 oh cool
events-chat 2022-01-30 20:59:31 i did that a couple times
one was a biplane double fuselage bomber i posted in creations once (edited though to be more apocalyptic)
events-chat 2022-01-30 20:59:58 thats the only thing close to apocalyptic build that i have in creations
events-chat 2022-01-30 21:00:16 ah but there are wingless planes
events-chat 2022-01-30 21:00:34 
events-chat 2022-01-30 21:01:07 but not horizontal wings <:trollface:775024642104229898>
events-chat 2022-01-30 21:01:24 im pretty sure the wings hes talking about would be the airfoil

events-chat 2022-01-30 22:41:06 very good
events-chat 2022-01-31 00:09:54 not always <:trollface:775024642104229898> there are wingless planes
events-chat 2022-01-31 00:11:47 yes but this one doesnt look like a wing
events-chat 2022-01-31 00:12:10 these other two do but that one doesnt
events-chat 2022-01-31 00:12:33 its a fuselage that creates lift <:FineTroll:626841259746656289>
events-chat 2022-01-31 00:13:19 a funny fuselage
events-chat 2022-01-31 00:13:37 lets ask rbk is funny fuselages work
events-chat 2022-01-31 00:14:08 id rather participate then then 6am when i would have to participate
events-chat 2022-01-31 00:14:26 pacific time is not fun no time lines line up well
events-chat 2022-01-31 00:15:32 ive been waiting for mech event to end so i could do something for once but the time is just <:nooo:787097964946259978>  so i gotta wait till next time hopefully timezones wont be funny
events-chat 2022-01-31 00:16:21 i didnt finish my boat because i forgot about it
events-chat 2022-01-31 00:16:49 rbk make plane event where max speed is 150
and fix time
events-chat 2022-01-31 00:21:59 rbk make a ww1/interwar event where:
There are two teams because yes
one team has airships and the other has small planes
the planes must look like the timeline (advanced biplanes and triplanes, crappy monoplanes)

airships get to have a maximum of one firework and also 8 guns
they can be any size including folding
they cannot go over 100 speed
i guess airships could get explosive blocks for bombing reasons but they have nothing to bomb unless you get lucky like me and a plane flies into your bombs as they are falling and explodes

planes must:
not go over 150
5 guns
can only be between 10x10x10 and cant fold
planes can carry small bombs/1 explosive block to bomb the airships if they want

idk what else to add
creations-chat 2022-01-31 00:34:10 i wish mine were like that

uncomplicated... those were the days
events-chat 2022-01-31 00:41:23 pretty sure they can but host bombers are chad versions
events-chat 2022-01-31 00:42:05 if i were to compare host to player bombers irl it would be like a bristol blenheim (normal) vs an avro lancaster (host)
events-chat 2022-01-31 00:46:04 yes
events-chat 2022-01-31 00:47:21 how do the other racers get up there

events-chat 2022-02-03 03:56:27 oh its not specified but we get lame turrets
events-chat 2022-02-03 03:57:39 <@!466793357318815744> does this count as a swivel turret (im not a turret know-the-terms expert)
events-chat 2022-02-03 04:01:03 then whats a swivel turret
events-chat 2022-02-03 04:02:40 wait didnt he say you can have them but it can only move 25 degrees in all directions
events-chat 2022-02-03 04:03:02 
events-chat 2022-02-03 04:03:19 yes thats what im saying
events-chat 2022-02-03 04:04:24 nononono that was an example from another build because i dont feel like making a real example rn i would put it in the tail of course
creations-chat 2022-02-03 04:06:28 bots breaking
events-chat 2022-02-03 04:28:43 technically speaking they arent
events-chat 2022-02-03 05:03:05 do smoke pipes for flame effects in the engines count as lag machines
events-chat 2022-02-03 05:33:02 yeah i usually have the hard to see but also a nice detail exhaust trails and then a larger fire and smoke effect for damage
events-chat 2022-02-03 05:33:28 making a super-maneuverable avro lancaster <:trollface:775024642104229898>

events-chat 2022-02-04 07:17:27 
events-chat 2022-02-04 07:18:02 
events-chat 2022-02-04 07:18:24 and the one he mentioned was a 'bonus' one where you get it rigged in your favor if you make it <:trollface:775024642104229898>
events-chat 2022-02-04 07:19:12 but it does say you can make a bomber but only fard ones
events-chat 2022-02-04 07:19:32 host bombers have different specifications then normal bombers
events-chat 2022-02-04 07:21:02 if we use the worse bomber guidelines
events-chat 2022-02-04 07:21:43 technically though i didnt use any folding and also made a mini version
events-chat 2022-02-04 07:22:29 you dont get to use bombs lol
events-chat 2022-02-04 07:23:03 because yes
events-chat 2022-02-04 07:23:28 do it

events-chat 2022-02-06 20:38:14 why are so many fard looking planes participants but most of the good looking ones arent
events-chat 2022-02-06 20:43:09 alpha would approve, nobody else would play
events-chat 2022-02-06 20:45:36 why is tinon not shooting back
events-chat 2022-02-06 20:55:10 i got inspired by hyperbits camera they should do a camera bot battle lol
events-chat 2022-02-06 21:00:57 ok so they are all going for blue team to win but from the earlier rounds red did more damage so as of now red team is better
events-chat 2022-02-06 21:05:15 the stream chat argument is mald
events-chat 2022-02-06 21:05:49 i dont even know what that means but they keep calling each other that
events-chat 2022-02-06 21:07:40 red team pro
blue team slow
events-chat 2022-02-06 21:09:05 hyperbit said red won
events-chat 2022-02-06 21:09:39 because blue was terrible red was good
events-chat 2022-02-06 21:11:17 because they glitch out
events-chat 2022-02-06 21:12:27 you forgo(fard) the scoreboard up there
events-chat 2022-02-06 21:13:26 they say red fat and bald but now they are saying they lost to a fat and also bald team<:m_:778994206948589638>
events-chat 2022-02-06 21:14:43 lien't
events-chat 2022-02-06 21:15:37 simply just superior
events-chat 2022-02-06 21:16:08 same
events-chat 2022-02-06 21:16:46 or do this except wwi planes (only biplanes or triplanes) and the host bombers are zeppelins <:trollface:775024642104229898>
events-chat 2022-02-06 21:17:27 planes only get one gun
events-chat 2022-02-06 21:17:44 zeppelins get max because turrets are funny
events-chat 2022-02-06 21:18:05 and also the planes need to be motorlocked so they are weaker
events-chat 2022-02-06 21:18:36 some do but only one gun it would be quite fun
events-chat 2022-02-06 21:18:59 and the rotating guns can only rotate 40 degrees in all directions
events-chat 2022-02-06 21:21:10 congratulations for winning i was voting for your team
events-chat 2022-02-06 21:21:38 yeah he definitely did

creations-chat 2023-06-07 20:45:50 my man do you not know what overrated is. The F-5 has about maybe 75 entries in the creations area (Half of them are mig 28 too). The F-14 on the other hand has maybe 400 entries.

Also you have no builds at all in creations so we can all assume your best plane is the tutorial one at the beginning of the game <:trollface:775024642104229898> so shut up whitename

creations-chat 2023-06-07 21:02:14 hey you know how it be with the slowmode
creations-chat 2023-06-07 21:15:07 my f5 had a 4 block long nose (after the canopy)
creations-chat 2023-06-07 21:20:41 i mean kinda bad proportions but only because the tail is one block too short my guy
creations-chat 2023-06-07 21:37:46 should i start a new build or fix the "extremely bad proportions" (literally 1 one block short) on my f5 so the whitename cant cry about it anymore
creations-chat 2023-06-08 07:17:35 yo nice
i reworked mine after that whitename said the proportions were a bit off and somehow a tiny little bit like that ended up adding 400 blocks but now it perfectly matches my overlay

edit; sorry i replied to the wrong message meant to reply to <@604636023141433365> but yeah
creations-chat 2023-06-08 07:35:14 you can even add the 20mm in the nose pretty easily just like one piece of pistonlocks
