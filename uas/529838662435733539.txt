help 2020-03-22 02:56:37 Is your creation big and folded?
help 2020-03-22 02:56:51 Yeah. I have always had trouble with that.
help 2020-03-22 02:57:16 I'm not sure what exactly it is, but when it is folded you can't have mouse controls.
help 2020-03-22 02:57:18 No.
help 2020-03-22 02:58:10 One thing you can do though is use motor 2's and attach wing panels to them for mouse controls.
help 2020-03-22 02:59:00 I am also pretty sure that it has something to do with not directly being connected to the Main Pilot Seat.
help 2020-03-22 02:59:09 Alright. Good luck!

creations-chat 2020-08-04 20:25:56 i was tempted to make a -300 variant as well. but i don't have plot space
creations-chat 2020-08-04 20:29:40 lol. took me a while to perfect. too many details
creations-chat 2020-08-04 20:30:52 my nose took me a long time to perfect. and i have disassembled and rebuilt about 90 percent of the plane
creations-chat 2020-08-04 20:31:30 so, my opinions.
creations-chat 2020-08-04 20:31:41 i need better screenshots to see the entire plane
creations-chat 2020-08-04 20:32:04 but overall, i think the wings could be straight to the winglets
creations-chat 2020-08-04 20:32:27 there is a change in wedges halfway down the wing or so
creations-chat 2020-08-04 20:33:42 also i think if you had thicker wings it would look a ton better
creations-chat 2020-08-04 20:33:53 my plane flies much better than you would think
creations-chat 2020-08-04 20:34:16 what is your roblox username? i will come lag your game, and give you a ride

creations-chat 2020-11-23 05:45:08 very plain if you ask me. not much detail
creations-chat 2020-11-23 05:46:43 go to the excessive level like i do and then people will just judge you even more for it. lol
creations-chat 2020-11-23 05:48:28 honestly, i think that you could give it some more shape, and make it a lot shorter. there is a lot of curve on the top of the reference, and your's is just straight. and thank you
creations-chat 2020-11-23 05:53:22 realistically, you could just shorten your current airship. just snip the ends off with an autoclicker if you want to go the route of rebuilding. but colors and some tweaks would benefit a lot
creations-chat 2020-11-23 05:55:38 honestly, for future builds: when i build an aircraft of any type, i build a very rough outline, with the entire fuselage shape, and then make a vertical view of it, to verify size and proporions, and build out from there. take the advice if you want, i'm just sayin
creations-chat 2020-11-23 05:58:21 that's what you'd have to do if you want it to look proportional and be the correct length. how i see it, is if you want it to be proporionate, you would have to do 2 things: either make it fatter, which means you have to delete literally the entire thing except the gondolas, or deleting the front and moving everything back.
creations-chat 2020-11-23 06:00:58 did you show any reference?

creations-chat 2020-11-26 05:06:42 nah, he's right... I left all the details on my 757. i just forgot to add them
creations-chat 2020-11-26 05:08:40 they just don't exist... I will remember to add them next time i build a plane, though... it's all good
creations-chat 2020-11-26 05:12:05 sorry guys... i messed up

creations-chat 2020-11-26 05:28:56 wut dat
creations-chat 2020-11-26 05:54:07 yo how i get 27 upvotes and 2 downvotes in an hour...?
creations-chat 2020-11-26 05:56:35 you realize that thing is motorlock hell, and it all actually does stuff, right? i don't think you understand how much it actually hurts your brain unspawned
creations-chat 2020-11-26 06:02:21 i bit off way more than i could chew when i started building my dc-10
creations-chat 2020-11-26 06:04:21 my brain hasn't worked the same since i built this
creations-chat 2020-11-26 06:06:35 there are like 3 sections that lock off each other. adds a hell of a lot of detail
creations-chat 2020-11-26 06:08:12 this is also the back of my tail engine, when i was first building it. it all comes together nicely, but the unspawned version is hellish
creations-chat 2020-11-26 06:14:38 i use it for aircraft cockpits and details, cause i can't go without details
help 2020-11-26 06:15:28 that's why
help 2020-11-26 06:15:37 motor 2 sucks
help 2020-11-26 06:15:40 never use it
help 2020-11-26 06:15:53 i have never used motor 2 for anything
help 2020-11-26 06:15:59 they're real broken
help 2020-11-26 06:16:14 nah, my stuff is all surface controlled
help 2020-11-26 06:17:36 i build big planes, and motor 2 controls would break the whole plane
creations-chat 2020-11-26 06:45:58 don't the engines go a fair bit forward from the wings? and those wings seem way too far forward. i agree with the cockpit windows too
creations-chat 2020-11-28 00:31:58 die
creations-chat 2020-11-28 01:38:30 i come back to see y'all talking about my exterior. i can post one, one second. let me get back into game
creations-chat 2020-11-28 01:45:49 talk crap on exterior of private DC-10 because it's trash and i "only show the interior" and i only posted the interior because i have posted the exterior a million and a quarter times in the past

creations-chat 2020-12-30 22:29:57 i started working on revamping the interior or my motorhome, since i learned a lot from my VIP DC-10.
creations-chat 2020-12-30 22:31:58 here's what it looked like before. despite not having a slide-out on one side, it seems more open in the new version.
creations-chat 2020-12-30 22:34:24 thank you! i'm happy with the small little details in the kitchen
creations-chat 2021-02-20 06:13:43 yes
