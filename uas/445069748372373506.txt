plane-crazy 2020-05-03 06:40:33 also, to answer your question from earlier, I don't know what it is I need references
plane-crazy 2020-05-03 06:39:51 I can almost bet something will go wrong in folding
plane-crazy 2020-05-03 06:38:31 Basically a Falcon Heavy
plane-crazy 2020-05-03 06:38:26 Massive Rocket
plane-crazy 2020-05-03 06:38:18 Me?
plane-crazy 2020-05-03 06:37:42 Well, this is gonna have a lot more folds than I was planning
plane-crazy 2020-05-03 06:11:52 I'm in the middle of making a basically a Falcon Heavy creation except it's massive
plane-crazy 2020-05-03 05:52:37 I'm using way too many hours on this game and my rocket...
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 18:09:38 it was somewhat helpful for my purposes but I had weird folds
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 18:09:17 I remember watching that
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 18:05:25 plane?
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 18:05:12 help my brain
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 18:05:07 I still need to make the stage separation, third stage, and upper stage landing mechanism...
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 18:01:01 Yeah graphic is set to 2
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 17:59:09 If you can even see me...
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 10:50:26 Better?
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 09:18:04 I'm a bit of an Elon fan I think
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 08:57:30 #frustration
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 08:57:01 When you realize your creation is 1 block too tall
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 08:40:03 Apparently 16 super thrusters and 1 huge thruster can't lift 500 blocks combination of halfs and wedges
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 08:35:48 My save went from 500 and a bit to 1.5k and a bit
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 08:21:57 Apparently I've already used 700 1x2 wedges
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 08:12:20 the pole in the corner is the build box height
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 08:11:43 Wonder that voxel would say about this
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 08:08:21 fps cap unlocker and mega good pc
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 08:06:40 my iPod can barely handle this game
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 08:06:04 mines is at 2 and my pc dies every once in a while
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 08:02:43 Also, my legs might be a bit overkill
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 08:01:55 Cause I was doing other stuff and I finally got to get the legs done
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 08:00:43 me and my legs
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 08:00:36 
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 07:48:34 a bit flatter?
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 07:47:16 can't tell if it's going forward or reverse
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 07:47:04 nah they're practically identical
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 07:45:18 now, time for the all nighter engineering to begin
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 07:44:38 I'm gonna need links...
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 07:43:03 make the middle rounder maybe
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 06:41:18 I can't make planes in a game that literally has "plane" in its name
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 06:40:33 though to be honest my last scaled was pretty good
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 06:40:06 I suck at making scaled things
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 06:39:17 I've seen worse though
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 06:39:05 wut
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 06:38:57 True
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 06:38:18 even inventions
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 06:37:54 people make all sorts of unique, custom and crazy things
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 06:37:28 not at all I believe
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 06:36:06 what do you mean by replicas?
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 06:34:36 thanks
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 06:34:34 Ah I see
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 06:26:35 don't remember how I got my designer rank but I think it was a mega car
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 06:26:18 and the ranks is where you can find more ranks to achieve
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 06:25:44 kudos? no clue what that means but thanks
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 06:25:24 I just took a decent side shot and measured height to length ratio
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 06:24:37 looks good there from my judgements which aren't accurate
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 06:23:41 hold on gimme a min
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 06:22:49 what it?
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 06:22:40 <@!410992368494575626> <#609442446249820211>
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 06:22:06 and I like the mech from earlier
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 06:21:39 Looks like you're better than me at building
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 06:20:10 <#504436696021204992>
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 06:19:33 shadow right?
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 06:18:58 wasn't me btw
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 06:18:40 there you go
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 06:17:00 post in <#504436696021204992> and get rank?
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 06:09:31 thanks and oof
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 06:07:10 I gotta make my legs fatter
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 06:06:16 ignore my other 2 boosters
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 06:06:06 This is what it looks like deployed btw
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 06:04:54 alright thanks
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 06:03:57 as the chat goes silent...
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 06:03:21 Think this is overkill length for rocket legs?
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 05:18:42 Big dreams, weird head
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 05:11:55 great time to burn my brain
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 05:11:34 Is it a bad idea to go straight for Mad Scientist rank without a basic rocket scientist rank?
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 04:09:09 yea
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 04:08:41 <#478584971670454284>
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 04:07:53 How much will having a motor on only one side of a rocket affect stability?
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 03:39:30 uhhhh
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 03:37:53 suspicion of alt? lol
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 03:36:17 ... anyone?
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 03:35:53 is a 7 blocks + 2 half block wide rocket booster too big?
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 03:21:57 Apparently I've been playing Google Chrome for 6hrs
plane-crazy 2020-01-07 06:22:00 my front bonnet isn't going up and I don't want to post it on the discord
plane-crazy 2020-01-07 06:21:15 frustration...
plane-crazy 2020-01-07 05:40:53 I want like a door specialist role
plane-crazy 2020-01-07 05:40:29 What we talking 'bout
plane-crazy 2019-12-30 22:32:04 Where does the sparkler show up in the inventory?
plane-crazy 2019-12-30 22:31:22 where does it show?
plane-crazy 2019-12-30 22:31:17 uh it was the sparkler
plane-crazy 2019-12-30 22:30:55 not working
plane-crazy 2019-12-30 22:30:17 and I know where it is I touched it but I can't find it in the pvp items
plane-crazy 2019-12-30 22:29:57 how do I get the fireworks?
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 19:40:09 Is this true?
plane-crazy 2019-12-11 20:00:48 Stop dam pingin' our roles
plane-crazy 2019-12-01 19:31:18 Someone help me with things
plane-crazy 2019-12-01 19:25:13 is this why I'm getting no help in <#478584971670454284> ? cuz everyone is talking bio here?
plane-crazy 2019-12-01 19:24:03 also, I need help in <#478584971670454284>
plane-crazy 2019-12-01 19:23:52 bruh
plane-crazy 2019-12-01 19:23:23 Anyone who's studies some decently advanced biology probably would
plane-crazy 2019-12-01 19:22:53 The heck are we talking about
plane-crazy 2019-12-01 06:02:21 Oks
plane-crazy 2019-12-01 06:01:44 I mean it kinda works you just have like 50 options less for key binding
plane-crazy 2019-12-01 06:01:13 Bruh why is the development game of the game playable on mobile?

plane-crazy 2019-10-14 10:15:40 idk I've never actually made a floating object thats meant to float before might do that later
plane-crazy 2019-10-14 10:15:04 and then they fail
plane-crazy 2019-10-14 10:14:52 my planes always force themselves into stalls
plane-crazy 2019-10-14 10:13:50 cough
plane-crazy 2019-10-14 10:13:48 Vtol engineer and shipwright and expert designer
plane-crazy 2019-10-14 10:13:19 ez for you to say cuz you know how to build
plane-crazy 2019-10-14 10:12:54 + side to side
plane-crazy 2019-10-14 10:12:42 drones that have turn, forward backward and altitude control as well as hover is a bit harder
plane-crazy 2019-10-14 10:11:59 I suck at planes so I'm making drones
plane-crazy 2019-10-14 10:11:33 Still stugling to fly my drone
plane-crazy 2019-10-14 10:10:54 using wedges is the closest you can get
plane-crazy 2019-10-14 10:10:41 you mean other than using cylinders right?
plane-crazy 2019-10-11 22:48:16 My files too big
plane-crazy 2019-10-11 22:46:42 ?
plane-crazy 2019-10-11 22:46:39 Wanna see
plane-crazy 2019-10-11 22:46:19 I took some slow mo vids of me smashing ball walls lol
plane-crazy 2019-09-22 23:56:06 I have a buncha stable spinning objects that don't use anchors but thats it lol
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 06:34:24 The only functioning thing I can make is something that spins
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 06:33:54 I can barely make a 4 prop drone
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 06:33:32 www
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 06:33:06 I can't even make a proper plane
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 03:38:40 Bruh resaving empty slots used up more data than before
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 01:08:01 
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 01:07:51 I have a major issue with my person on a server lol

plane-crazy 2019-08-13 10:29:11 I wish it showed up how much data each slot is worth
plane-crazy 2019-08-13 10:26:13 wonder how much data my mega really is
plane-crazy 2019-08-13 10:25:36 oks
plane-crazy 2019-08-13 10:25:16 oh ok
plane-crazy 2019-08-13 10:24:46 wait saves actually get corrupted?

plane-crazy 2019-08-10 10:55:07 yeah it took me 1.5 years to realize that
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 10:53:48 People getting hyped over my mega car lol
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 10:33:12 I keep dying while spawning my mega car and it kills the entire server
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 04:43:26 do friction blocks affect any movement then?
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 04:42:39 heat??
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 04:42:14 How do friction blocks work?
plane-crazy 2019-08-05 08:36:25 dont worry about it
plane-crazy 2019-08-05 08:36:07 2 hours later I have no choice actually

plane-crazy 2019-08-05 08:34:39 ik but I'm working on my mega scale car
plane-crazy 2019-08-05 08:34:20 getting very tired...
plane-crazy 2019-08-05 06:19:03 ima go build my mega scale car now
plane-crazy 2019-08-05 06:18:13 make it mega scale?
plane-crazy 2019-07-28 08:53:23 oaks
plane-crazy 2019-07-28 08:51:32 hmm
plane-crazy 2019-07-28 08:46:21 goes 290 reverse
plane-crazy 2019-07-28 08:45:58 i got like 503 out of it
plane-crazy 2019-07-28 08:45:02 this thing goes five hundred something on the tracks
plane-crazy 2019-07-28 08:42:34 totally went fine
plane-crazy 2019-07-28 08:41:56 does it fly?
plane-crazy 2019-07-28 08:41:51 ooo nice
plane-crazy 2019-07-28 08:41:20 pretty much
plane-crazy 2019-07-28 08:41:15 with boost on it goes like idk three four hundred
plane-crazy 2019-07-28 08:40:50 with boost off it goes 297
plane-crazy 2019-07-28 08:39:29 Anyone seen this?
plane-crazy 2019-07-28 08:36:54 then hit the dirt
plane-crazy 2019-07-28 08:36:45 got 280 out of it
plane-crazy 2019-07-28 08:36:22 Getting ready for tests
plane-crazy 2019-07-28 08:32:10 I'm like one sixty something cm
plane-crazy 2019-07-28 08:30:40 and I saw a spinning lifter fly into the air doing it lol
plane-crazy 2019-07-28 08:30:24 works
plane-crazy 2019-07-28 08:30:10 ik
plane-crazy 2019-07-28 08:29:35 like this right?
plane-crazy 2019-07-28 08:28:59 ik what you mean
plane-crazy 2019-07-28 08:28:55 yeah ik

plane-crazy 2019-07-28 08:27:19 
plane-crazy 2019-07-28 08:26:59 it went into ground and did nothing to keep me on the ground lol
plane-crazy 2019-07-28 08:26:22 with other blocks and terrain?
plane-crazy 2019-07-28 08:25:57 do cameras collide?
plane-crazy 2019-07-28 08:23:57 got it a bit more stable with cams but its undergroud cams so...
plane-crazy 2019-07-28 08:21:25 and I'm with a buncha starters
plane-crazy 2019-07-28 08:21:13 I don't know what colour sceme to do
plane-crazy 2019-07-28 08:20:14 cockpit view
plane-crazy 2019-07-28 08:19:28 
plane-crazy 2019-07-28 08:18:20 lol I'm spamming cams for good angles
plane-crazy 2019-07-28 08:13:25 do cameras interfere with colision?
plane-crazy 2019-07-28 08:10:47 also, my indycar is flat bottom and like a tiny clearance
plane-crazy 2019-07-28 08:07:00 tested works for normals
plane-crazy 2019-07-28 08:06:55 thats why
plane-crazy 2019-07-28 08:06:21 I'm using winter wheels though so does that make a difference?
plane-crazy 2019-07-28 08:05:34 naa didnt work
plane-crazy 2019-07-28 08:05:18 how do you even copy that even
plane-crazy 2019-07-28 08:04:24 tried setting wheels 50 it set back to 8
plane-crazy 2019-07-28 08:03:15 I probably set it to 5 for a reason but dont remember
plane-crazy 2019-07-28 08:02:44 lets try 8
plane-crazy 2019-07-28 08:02:36 speed is 5
plane-crazy 2019-07-28 08:01:57 cams?
plane-crazy 2019-07-28 08:01:49 ik but it looks good
plane-crazy 2019-07-28 08:01:12 lord I almost flipped it turning high speed
plane-crazy 2019-07-28 08:00:46 lol
plane-crazy 2019-07-28 08:00:31 has 0 climbing abilities
plane-crazy 2019-07-28 08:00:01 I think this thing is my best vehicle
plane-crazy 2019-07-28 07:59:12 it starts the fan playing jailbreak
plane-crazy 2019-07-28 07:58:26 my pc is a mac
plane-crazy 2019-07-28 07:57:56 but this is mine
plane-crazy 2019-07-28 07:57:49 nope then
plane-crazy 2019-07-28 07:57:46 this big boy that blows my pc up right?

plane-crazy 2019-07-28 07:56:48 lemme try and get a screen shot
plane-crazy 2019-07-28 07:56:20 here?
