creations-chat 2019-02-14 07:16:57 <@526036185836027915> I posted it here because it was a 'creation' of mine
creations-chat 2019-02-15 01:37:02 <@526036185836027915> I told you for fuck sake that I put in effort to figure out how to make that system and that it took a while to make it work you idiot.
creations-chat 2019-02-15 04:52:32 lol
creations-chat 2019-02-15 05:15:57 <@526036185836027915> Why do you have to be so picky about the freaking creations everyone posts and filter it so that it is under your stupid judgement of what you think is a good creation or contraption and what you think is not at your level?

creations-chat 2019-08-05 23:31:15 Body of the front half finished. Not painted yet. Construction of the body and mechanisms for the back half starts next. Painting and basic interior after that.
creations-chat 2019-08-05 23:58:27 Forgot mirrors so I added mirrors that come out and should be adjustable.
creations-chat 2019-08-08 08:25:11 Finished the rear body and the wing
creations-chat 2019-08-08 08:29:23 I think it became a hybrid
creations-chat 2019-08-08 08:29:48 and it's a bit long
creations-chat 2019-08-08 08:31:45 I *was* looking at one:1 references for the mid and back
creations-chat 2019-08-08 08:32:00 dunno what even happened with the front
creations-chat 2019-08-08 08:48:15 Edited the rear wing a bit. Made it the double wing it's supposed to be. I also cut a massive hold in the back so I can attempt to make the engine.
creations-chat 2019-08-08 08:56:22 I got 15 upvotes for the first pic of my mega scale car a while ago
creations-chat 2019-08-08 09:00:05 yeah I wasn't expecting it in the first place but then the votes went downhill fast

creations-chat 2019-08-08 23:53:15 Done most of my interior and got a working steering wheel too. Seats and I'm done the interior and start the engine.
creations-chat 2019-08-09 01:39:48 <@!429665143677255681> should I make it a size smaller?
creations-chat 2019-08-09 01:40:11 ok

creations-chat 2019-08-09 02:02:07 what does lock even do on pistons?
creations-chat 2019-08-09 02:03:08 that doesn't make sense though to lock them in their starting positions
creations-chat 2019-08-09 02:03:39 ...
creations-chat 2019-08-09 02:11:28 what part of the piston is what moves everything?

help 2020-11-14 04:54:20 I'm trying to plan out how to build a mega starship but I don't want to be using double folds like on my Falcon 9 cause the folds keep buckling
help 2020-11-14 04:55:26 Yeah it just infolds itself
help 2020-11-14 04:55:40 I even have fold locks inside and still does it
help 2020-11-14 04:56:11 It's impossible to fold it because I have to anchor

help 2020-11-14 04:58:28 And I am using motor 1. Motor 2 wouldn't even get close to handling 6k blocks
help 2020-11-14 04:59:01 I just don't want stuff sticking out of the rocket

help 2021-03-02 00:45:31 How can I make a heli rotor / cyclorotor control system more stable? (ping me for reply)
help 2021-03-02 00:47:58 I've been trying to use the cyclorotor linear swashplate system for a heli rotor but if it's not stable then it's not any better than a rotating swashplate
help 2021-03-02 00:54:13 what about general rotor control stability?
help 2021-07-04 21:42:25 I'm trying to make a gimbal system for my rocket's engines, but the motors are shaky and unstable, I have limited space, and the engines are 4 sets of 36 super rocket engines which makes them really powerful. The vehicle is also a bit shaky cause I have other things on motors which are locked. How can I make a gimbal system that's smooth, stable and has the strength to turn and maintain angles on the engines?
help 2021-07-04 21:43:11 normal motors directly on the engines doesn't really work cause it isn't stable or smooth
