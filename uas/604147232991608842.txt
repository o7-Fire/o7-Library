creations-chat 2021-06-20 22:01:39 is there a way to put wings on halfblocks vertically?
creations-chat 2021-06-20 23:10:51 put half blocks below the wing and the motor, right?
creations-chat 2021-06-21 00:28:07 when placing control surfaces in the nose im assuming u place it vertically right?
creations-chat 2021-06-21 00:36:19 when putting control surfaces in the nose u do it vertically right
also in hover engines u should put drag to 0 right
what settings should u use for hover engines in general tbh
help 2021-06-21 14:28:40 are there any ways to stop speed wobbles?

help 2021-06-24 01:12:18 so my plane is having trouble going up and down fast enough, rn its pretty slow. i have control surfaces in the nose but their w cuz someone told me to put them that way
help 2021-06-24 01:12:59 also my thrusters are w and s but i do barrel roles with a and d, so i control the turning most of the time with my mouse
help 2021-06-24 01:13:03 anyone got tips
help 2021-06-24 04:06:57 nice man
help 2021-06-24 04:08:42 sorry i thought the mechanics were good
help 2021-06-24 17:07:55 so i see people with all these planes that can go up and down and do barrel roles really fast, how do i do that lol
help 2021-06-24 17:08:15 i can do barrel roles with my plane and stuff but idk if i have the right controls
help 2021-06-24 17:08:55 w and s is my rocket thrust, a and d makes me do barrel roles and i have glitch mouse so i control it most of the time with my mouse
help 2021-06-24 17:09:27 however i feel like it would be easier to control without the mouse, but that also means i cant look around me so is there a fix to that
help 2021-06-24 17:13:32 ok

help 2021-06-24 23:43:36 so i see people tilt their planes to turn but whenever i do it it always goes up or down at the same time and im wondering how people do that lol

help 2021-08-26 01:30:30 ive been noticing that alot of youtubers who have REALLY stable planes (like u can fly upside down without tilting down) use only rockets alot of the time, should i start using those instead of hover drives?
help 2021-08-26 01:30:47 i painted a triangle red in one of my builds fuck u mean
help 2021-08-26 01:30:52 a star too

help 2021-08-26 01:31:21 mainly ones that are sort of outlines instead of whole emojis
help 2021-08-26 01:40:12 can i atleast have tips for stability then
help 2021-08-26 01:40:23 but i still want a reason as to why they use rockets instead of hover drives
help 2021-08-26 01:41:26 ohh
help 2021-08-26 01:41:46 do u mean cover more area with wings or motorlock wings into the same place?
help 2021-08-26 01:41:51 dont wanna confuse them
help 2021-08-26 01:42:40 yep but then when i speed up to max speed (1200 or somethin like that, shakes at 1050) it goes upwards
help 2021-08-26 01:42:52 :/
help 2021-08-26 01:43:08 well it does shake and i do think it lags a bit
help 2021-08-26 01:44:10 ty

help 2021-08-26 02:38:18 tbh probably
help 2021-08-26 02:38:51 off topic rn but is there a good way to base a block off of when looking at plane blueprints
help 2021-08-26 02:39:03 like the landing gear should be a 1x1
help 2021-08-26 02:39:12 or a the wings should be a certain length
help 2021-08-26 02:39:20 yeah thats also true
help 2021-08-26 02:50:39 yall think 30 blocks is good for a fw 109? i divided the blueprints into 15 parts (the landing gear width as one part, landing gear wheel = 1 block) but it looked too small so i doubled it to 30 (now landing gear wheel is 2x2 cylinder)
help 2021-08-26 02:51:01 representation
help 2021-08-26 02:52:52 didnt notice that in the background 💀

help 2021-08-26 02:56:02 also can u answer the question about plane scale its ok if u dont lol
help 2021-08-26 02:56:50 wym it wont shoot?
help 2021-08-26 02:56:57 do u mean cuz theres no hole in the middle or
