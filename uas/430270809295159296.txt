help 2023-04-06 21:02:15 Use a normal motor to spin it, place a block above the rotor, place motor2 on the 4 sides on the block and place wing panels out from the motor2.

Make the motor2s servo and tilt them to create lift while the main motor ir spinning.

Copy the design on top of the block and make it go double the speed in the other direction. Also make the motor2s go in the other direction
