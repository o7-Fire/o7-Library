creations-chat 2020-10-31 22:44:56 Mini cargo plane, but do a hercules because i think it might look better
creations-chat 2020-10-31 22:47:41 ok sorry
creations-chat 2020-10-31 22:51:04 I dont know what it usually looks like, i only joined 2 hours ago
creations-chat 2020-10-31 23:22:49 what does hof mean?
creations-chat 2020-10-31 23:24:03 ok thanks
creations-chat 2020-10-31 23:32:09 Should i post my custom fighter plane to creations as well?
creations-chat 2020-10-31 23:33:51 What do you think i could do with the propeller? no the propeller does not move because it is too big, so i motor locked it inwards to make it look less hideous.
creations-chat 2020-10-31 23:35:11 no, do you know a way to make it smaller or something so i can make it move?
creations-chat 2020-10-31 23:39:27 I am trying to make the propeller work but its just glitching out
creations-chat 2020-10-31 23:41:48 The propeller looks too small with 1 block long blades and too long with 2 block long blades
creations-chat 2020-10-31 23:51:44 its win+g for me
creations-chat 2020-10-31 23:54:07 your friend is dumb

creations-chat 2020-11-01 00:23:20 I have only used rens' motor lock tutorial to build my pizza slice
the-dump 2020-11-01 00:32:59 it is 3 hours and 30 minutes until november here
creations-chat 2020-11-01 00:35:15 a rotating sword isnt a shredder though?
creations-chat 2020-11-01 12:13:02 I can get expert designer from a flying piece of pizza
creations-chat 2020-11-01 12:14:04 <@!656137684213039124> I can get expert designer 5, i do not want aeronautical engineer 2
creations-chat 2020-11-01 12:17:32 400 i think
creations-chat 2020-11-01 12:18:48 It was a lot harder to tweak the balast, because even changing a control panel from Q and E to automatic made the plane tip up or down. The balast has to be down to an exact .01, and then it is still glitchy
creations-chat 2020-11-01 12:22:35 I think it looks good
