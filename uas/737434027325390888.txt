bug-reports 2022-05-22 20:48:44 I wouldnt be suprised if this is reported a lot but ever time I hit a part that connects a chunk of a vehicle that part just freezes there and sometimes if you hit a certian part that vehicle is frozen yet they still attack you and move around thus making them invisible from your perspective
