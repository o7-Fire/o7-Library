creations-chat 2021-10-05 12:29:59 Update: this is the most complicated rear-end that I have made because I have to fold and motor lock and somehow make everything fit with no issues
creations-chat 2021-10-05 12:32:07 Is there a way I can fold before the motors lock?
creations-chat 2021-10-05 15:33:50 I figured out a way to do it before seeing your message, I motor locked the rear-end and the roof. Thanks though.
