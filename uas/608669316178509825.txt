creations-chat 2019-12-15 00:48:33 I actually had a build similar to that but this is w a y better
creations-chat 2019-12-15 01:49:15 <@!437078588701933568> If you want me to show it I will. Same concept (has helicopter blades but flies as a plane) but 2 main differences: 1: This is oc and his is a replica, and 2: mine is M E G A scuffed (it was something i put together in about 2 minutes)

creations-chat 2019-12-20 03:06:39 F-15 SMTD ACTIVE in prototype camo
creations-chat 2019-12-20 03:07:03 with the power of 8 god darn ballast blocks I got this thing to stay "level"
creations-chat 2019-12-20 03:08:00 shot from the rear
creations-chat 2019-12-20 03:08:25 it's mostly because the wings were stubby
creations-chat 2019-12-20 03:08:35 I probably could've used wings now that I think about it
creations-chat 2019-12-20 03:09:30 on the F-15 ACTIVE there's a tiny winglet on the front that helps with STOL
creations-chat 2019-12-20 03:09:42 so having them start on the intakes simply isn't feasable
creations-chat 2019-12-20 03:10:18 c h o n k
creations-chat 2019-12-20 03:14:39 thx for the suggestion of hidden wings

creations-chat 2019-12-21 03:44:49 SR-91 Aurora (Otherwise known as the conspiracy theorist's dorito)
creations-chat 2019-12-21 03:45:03 this thing was so chonky I had to use a conveyor drive to propel it
creations-chat 2019-12-21 04:24:51 Nice
creations-chat 2019-12-22 17:32:52 arabic
creations-chat 2019-12-25 19:40:57 people are a bit too dislike happy though
creations-chat 2020-04-13 21:40:50 Turret for a ship that will never be because I'm lazy and can't fold
creations-chat 2020-04-13 21:41:39 yes
creations-chat 2020-04-13 21:42:12 that's because both of those cannons are magnetic accelerators
they fire explosive balls of death and have a magazine of 3 balls each
creations-chat 2020-04-13 21:42:38 I'm suprised I could make a MAC that small
creations-chat 2020-04-13 22:13:47 I remember having that aircapture idea when I was trying to build a sky carrier a while back
creations-chat 2020-04-13 22:14:04 at least I have proof it works now, because that carrier never materialized
creations-chat 2020-04-14 15:34:07 How to get likes with creations is a mystery
creations-chat 2020-04-14 15:46:57 autoloading MAC concept
because having two rounds in the cannon at the same time is annoying
i might use this in other designs, who knows
creations-chat 2020-04-14 22:37:15 hey, remember when I said I would never make a ship for the chonky gun
i lied
my first truly giant build, it has a 90 degree fold and consists of about 1.7k blocks
detail is a bit sparse, but that can be fixed later
creations-chat 2020-04-15 14:08:20 tbh I can't tell what gets you upvoted and what gets you downvoted at this point
creations-chat 2020-04-15 14:09:07 "hey look a uboat, let's give it 10 downvotes"
"hey look another uboat, let's give it 23 upvotes"
creations-chat 2020-04-15 14:09:09 like what
creations-chat 2020-04-15 14:12:16 My boat has like 27 downvotes even though it was my most ambitious build yet (I'm still slightly salty)
and then my Pixy Morgan replica which only took an hour to do got 20 upvotes
like what do you want JUST TELL ME
creations-chat 2020-04-15 14:13:15 however I did notice I forgot to paint a block on the boat
reee
creations-chat 2020-04-15 14:13:42 it was also boxy because it was my first fold
plenty of things I could fix up
creations-chat 2020-04-15 14:14:29 yeah I'm pretty sure I got a negative vote average and then snowballed
but that might be me just being salty
creations-chat 2020-04-15 14:15:51 I think you can still see it on creations if you scroll far enough up
it was above the M4 sherman that had 8 pics posted
creations-chat 2020-04-15 14:16:56 yeah my best build ever was a ADFX-1 replica and that was about 400 blocks
creations-chat 2020-04-15 14:17:26 *and there's my problem*
creations-chat 2020-04-15 14:17:52 it does look ugly
but it was built a bit more for function than form
creations-chat 2020-04-15 14:18:18 that big cannon on the front can actually fire
the ship was built around that
creations-chat 2020-04-15 14:21:00 let's end this on a good note
I'm thinking that a tank would be good to make next, and I think I will incorporate my autoloading system into it
creations-chat 2020-04-15 14:21:12 it will be my first foray into rope tracks though
creations-chat 2020-04-15 15:39:45 This aircraft carrier is right under the 2000 block limit to compete for floating fortress
big sad
help 2020-04-15 15:41:30 How do you make a ship stable in the water?
creations-chat 2020-04-15 15:45:03 f
help 2020-04-15 15:45:43 ok
help 2020-04-15 15:47:06 oh
so keep as much weight as possible further down into the ship
creations-chat 2020-04-16 01:12:35 microfighters be like
help 2020-04-16 12:59:12 My guess is that the large number of blocks is caused by the immense amount of wedges he is using for the block wings
but if it weren't for that, I'd still assume it was a 1000+ block build
creations-chat 2020-04-16 13:47:20 don't talk to me or my son ever again

help 2020-04-17 12:30:30 you can cleverly use propeller blades to exploit aerodynamics to stabilize your base
just have them angled up on all sides, so the base stays relatively stable when moving, and completely stable when falling
creations-chat 2020-04-17 15:01:23 choo choo
creations-chat 2020-06-02 20:51:08 If it keeps lopping, that's probably a center of lift/center of mass problem
creations-chat 2020-06-02 20:51:19 make sure the blue circle is slightly behind the yellow one
creations-chat 2020-06-02 20:51:33 your plane should be sluggish, but far more stable that way

help 2022-08-20 03:37:58 do we got big brained mfs in here because I need help
I'm trying to get a cyclorotor assembly to produce lateral lift, but the ways I have tried doing it so far has caused unwanted vertical lift as described by this shitty ms paint drawing
should I try out a gimbal, or some completely different strategy to achieve the lateral lift without impacting the vertical lift of the rotor?
