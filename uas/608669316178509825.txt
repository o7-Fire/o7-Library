plane-crazy 2020-06-08 21:52:19 hm
plane-crazy 2020-06-08 21:48:05 unless its a vtol
plane-crazy 2020-06-08 21:48:02 oh that doesn't matter
plane-crazy 2020-06-08 21:47:54 but you need to know that the engine placement affects things
plane-crazy 2020-06-08 21:47:40 it can be compensated for
plane-crazy 2020-06-08 21:47:08 a pitchup/down tendency can be caused by placing them really high up
plane-crazy 2020-06-08 21:46:51 but yeah just look at the engines
plane-crazy 2020-06-08 21:46:45 it has no indicator in plane crazy
plane-crazy 2020-06-08 21:46:21 and the center of thrust
plane-crazy 2020-06-08 21:46:15 the center of lift
plane-crazy 2020-06-08 21:46:13 the center of mass
plane-crazy 2020-06-08 21:46:07 but in planes you want to balance three forces
plane-crazy 2020-06-08 21:45:55 that's a symptom of every plane
plane-crazy 2020-06-08 21:45:31 there's a couple of ways to do that
plane-crazy 2020-06-08 21:45:16 ah
plane-crazy 2020-06-08 21:45:15 oh improve the handling of the plane
plane-crazy 2020-06-08 21:44:27 like 1 digit
plane-crazy 2020-06-08 21:44:05 turn down torque my guy
plane-crazy 2020-06-08 21:43:45 i'll look back in about 2 days and it'll have 69 upvotes and 60 downvotes
it's cursed
plane-crazy 2020-06-08 21:42:51 .-.
plane-crazy 2020-06-08 21:41:23 you're right
but its painful
plane-crazy 2020-06-08 21:40:46 we go again
plane-crazy 2020-06-08 21:40:34 back to the mines
plane-crazy 2020-06-08 21:39:02 BUT I NEED EXACTLY ONE
plane-crazy 2020-06-08 21:38:52 i know
plane-crazy 2020-06-08 21:38:31 i just want aero 5
plane-crazy 2020-06-08 21:37:24 jesus
plane-crazy 2020-06-08 21:37:20 PLEASE
plane-crazy 2020-06-08 21:37:17 can I get these upvotes
plane-crazy 2020-06-08 21:37:12 hello
plane-crazy 2020-06-08 20:46:07 👀
plane-crazy 2020-06-08 20:44:54 uh oh
plane-crazy 2020-06-08 01:22:11 locked motors are too big brain for me
plane-crazy 2020-06-08 01:20:54 h
plane-crazy 2020-06-08 01:19:42 are you a masochist?
If yes, go ahead!
If no, use a conveyor drive like a normal person
plane-crazy 2020-06-07 22:58:04 if you're going to spellcheck, at least be right

plane-crazy 2020-06-07 21:44:59 Cringe
plane-crazy 2020-06-06 20:25:48 happens
plane-crazy 2020-06-05 15:17:30 yeah I know
it just didn't work b4 lol
plane-crazy 2020-06-05 15:16:46 that's probably why
plane-crazy 2020-06-05 15:16:32 *bruh*
plane-crazy 2020-06-05 15:16:05 which is a bruh moment
plane-crazy 2020-06-05 15:16:02 well yeah
I did all the things
and also did $ new
but nothing happened
plane-crazy 2020-06-05 15:11:28 well i have all the stuff necessary for a rank but how do I apply in the first place lmao
plane-crazy 2020-06-05 00:56:10 rip
plane-crazy 2020-06-04 20:36:47 otherwise idk
plane-crazy 2020-06-04 20:36:39 the nonlocked-ones
plane-crazy 2020-06-04 20:36:22 make sure the motors have freedom of movement
plane-crazy 2020-06-04 20:35:49 mk
plane-crazy 2020-06-04 20:35:02 motor lock
plane-crazy 2020-06-04 19:20:55 head
plane-crazy 2020-06-04 15:45:41 speed ain't 0 chief
that's not anchored
you can also see it shifting it's pitch around
plane-crazy 2020-06-04 15:39:14 yikes
plane-crazy 2020-06-04 15:37:22 Look ma, no hands!
plane-crazy 2020-06-03 16:39:06 *catamaran has left the chat*

plane-crazy 2020-04-17 18:44:12 yemns
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 18:43:45 cap it at 2 or 3 ok
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 18:43:40 that is way too many syllables
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 18:42:21 the Iowa is 7 meters longer
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 18:42:13 it is
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 18:37:14 "only 6 plots"
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 18:27:59 just a microfighter
nothing to see here
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 17:44:18 that they're just not all the way in
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 17:44:06 that's sometimes a problem
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 17:43:59 shove them into the jack harder
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 17:38:02 but ima be serious right now
that lag stops when I move the boat
so its something going on in the code that's causing it to lag that hard (it really doesn't like two-motor folds)
but still
*one core*<:KEKW:670310537300672528>
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 17:36:40 it uses only *one core*
<:MyDolphinIsntWorking:552912733008429081>
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 17:34:39 but tbh it is extremely hard not to make spaghet code
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 17:33:56 mad made spaghet code that rick would have to connect an enigma machine to his computer to decipher
so be it

plane-crazy 2020-04-16 13:48:45 never
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 00:44:38 numke
plane-crazy 2020-04-14 23:44:22 any ones, as long as they are opposite sides to each other
plane-crazy 2020-04-14 23:43:55 reverse the direction of two opposite props, and you should be fine
plane-crazy 2020-04-14 23:43:35 your props are all in the same direction, causing you to yaw harshly right
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 22:10:05 literally all you need
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 22:08:34 in the middle of the chassis
all you need it a 1x4x2 space
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 22:07:30 you could definitely fit a conveyor drive in that thing
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 22:05:16 if you look closely between the engine nacelles you can see the drive in action in the gif
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 22:04:26 just a slight pitchup tendency
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 22:04:14 it's extremely unstable while active
but the aircraft itself actually is stable in regular flight
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 22:03:19 about conveyor drive races
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 22:02:34 better picture of internals
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 22:01:48 picture of "internals"
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 22:00:28 crap gif of mine
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 21:59:42 I've made a couple of them
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 21:59:38 magnetic magazine systems
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 21:52:07 my classic builds usually make it to 5.5k
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 21:51:56 ok
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 21:51:09 why would a conveyor drive buckle
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 21:50:59 for a simple one
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 21:50:55 they get like 5k speed
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 21:50:47 drag makes that impossible
but your best bet is still a conveyor drive
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 21:49:10 magnet drives MEGA lag tho
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 21:48:26 conveyor drives are kinda simple
you push a conveyor with nothing above it with a piston into a position where there is someting attached to your ship above it *i.e half blocc*
the conveyor drives against the half block and pushes the piston, which pushes it back.
plane-crazy 2019-12-22 19:02:09 I am deeply humiliated and shall now go kill ms
plane-crazy 2019-12-22 19:01:59 *moment of realization*
plane-crazy 2019-12-22 02:19:59 the faster cores run, the hotter they get
plane-crazy 2019-12-22 02:19:50 It's because of heat problems
plane-crazy 2019-12-22 02:19:00 the entire point of having multiple cores is so that your cores don't have to run at 9 million GHZ
plane-crazy 2019-12-22 02:16:48 does the fortress have to float on water?
plane-crazy 2019-12-22 02:16:37 and I have an idea
plane-crazy 2019-12-22 02:16:32 so I saw the floating fortress role

plane-crazy 2019-12-20 22:18:11 "asphalt" extreme
plane-crazy 2019-12-20 20:10:14 time to shamelessly steal all of these ideas and put them on my builds
plane-crazy 2019-12-20 01:21:39 <:bruhaps:646045387911725106>
plane-crazy 2019-12-20 00:45:59 i also build quite small
plane-crazy 2019-12-20 00:45:52 so no
plane-crazy 2019-12-20 00:45:50 Most of my builds are around 400 blocks and take up around 2/3rds of the plot
plane-crazy 2019-12-19 22:37:42 they just need to be set up correctly
plane-crazy 2019-12-19 22:37:32 I think conveyor engines work in any orientation
plane-crazy 2019-12-19 22:30:28 so big f
plane-crazy 2019-12-19 22:30:25 2021 it got delayed
plane-crazy 2019-12-19 22:30:22 nope
plane-crazy 2019-12-19 22:27:21 it looks dank
plane-crazy 2019-12-19 22:27:16 ye
plane-crazy 2019-12-19 22:05:41 ok w h a t
plane-crazy 2019-12-19 02:30:30 the power of conveyor drives
plane-crazy 2019-12-18 23:08:29 if y'all are like "that build's pretty small" then I'm never getting to the hall of fame bc I simply don't got the PATIENCE
plane-crazy 2019-12-18 23:06:37 n o
plane-crazy 2019-12-18 23:06:17 just a gentler slope
plane-crazy 2019-12-18 23:06:12 not longer
plane-crazy 2019-12-18 23:06:08 I would make it less sloped
plane-crazy 2019-12-18 23:02:52 someone already built everything brother

plane-crazy 2019-12-18 22:30:07 I'm asking around about how the conveyor drive works and literally all there is to it is a conveyor driving itself
plane-crazy 2019-12-18 22:29:19 I looked at the video section for the first time and safe to say I am a certified small brained individual

plane-crazy 2019-12-18 20:53:12 <@!221496030355521536> how would you configure a conveyor drive
plane-crazy 2019-12-18 20:42:52 it works well

plane-crazy 2019-12-17 21:53:22 is that a p i s t o n
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 21:51:26 y'all be talking about reaching ridiculous speeds with these drives when IDK how to even build one
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 21:44:21 I'm guessing it's two conveyors with the moving part put on each other?
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 21:43:42 still don't know wth a conveyor engine is
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 21:43:07 it does but the wings are powerful enough to counteract it
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 21:42:11 (and of course the toaster killing power of 10 balls at 600 SPS)
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 21:41:58 the only problem with it is feeding issues, and you just jostle it a bit and it will work
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 21:39:51 it has a 10 round magazine just for lulz
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 21:39:42 I really just wanted to see what would occur if I mounted a gun on a plane
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 21:38:59 I already did, look in creations (it's a model tho)
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 21:36:17 plane mounted magnet howitzer
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 20:37:01 maybe god stays in heaven because he too lives in fear of what he's created

plane-crazy 2019-12-17 20:08:10 f f
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 20:01:37 so it wouldn't affect the plane itself
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 20:01:29 there's a loose parts only setting on the magnet
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 19:54:06 Perhaps I could mount a mag cannon on a plane?
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 19:53:43 also I've just realized how magnet blocks work and have a devilish idea
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 19:52:52 w a i t

plane-crazy 2019-12-13 21:51:43 when air is subsonic, making a smaller opening makes it go faster
plane-crazy 2019-12-13 21:51:34 it's because of how supersonic air works
