bot-central 2021-05-24 19:58:08 [Transparent Paint]
[CONFIGURABLE]

The Transparent Paint would be a paint option, that when you paint a block with this material/colour?, it is invisible when you spawn in. This could be useful for hiding motorlock that gets in the way of all your beautiful builds, motors that are used to fold large builds, or just any blocks that you need to have there, but they are exposed out of your build. It could be put as a material, or just a normal paint as an option just above the color pallet. When painted onto a surface, it shows as the transparency squares on the block. If the block already has colours on it, the transparency squares will be tinted that color, so you don't get lost on where anything is. This will be very useful on many builds of mine, and possibly yours!
