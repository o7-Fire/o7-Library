help 2022-07-16 11:44:21 So one rule for getting ranks says you can’t artificially increase the block count by using blocks instead of beams etc… I use blocks instead of beams, wing panel 1x1s, but not to increase the block count, it was originally to make it take less damage, is that okay?
help 2022-07-16 11:44:48 Or do I absolutely have to use beams whenever I can
help 2022-07-16 14:01:25 Whaaat? Nooo…
help 2022-07-16 14:01:28 But fr is it allowed
help 2022-07-16 14:01:36 If it wasn’t intentional
