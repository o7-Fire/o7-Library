creations-chat 2021-04-12 23:19:00 ‚ÄúWine‚Äù but dude flying around in a frikin fighter jet moving your mouse to aim guns is kinda try hard. Also why are your elevators touching your main wings...,...
creations-chat 2021-04-12 23:22:07 I get it your pic is on like a 20 degree angle but I lined up the blueprint with your main wings and the tail shouldn‚Äôt be that close also your intakes are way too forward
creations-chat 2021-04-12 23:24:29 also a fighter jet is the last thing you gonna put a moving turret it‚Äôs just about the most maneuverable thing you can get and putting a turret is lazy try hard. Also saying moving turrets on a fighter is feedback <@326172208638459915>
creations-chat 2021-04-12 23:27:44 ok ig be a try hard. With that mentality shredders are ok because it‚Äôs ‚Äútheir play style‚Äù but ok be cringe
creations-chat 2021-04-12 23:29:58 You right. We need to find a term for that. Maybe just call it a ‚Äútato‚Äù
creations-chat 2021-04-12 23:32:16 If it apparently accomplishes the same effect then freaking make them not move because it would be more traditional and would accomplish same effect in your eyes. But you obviously won‚Äôt because it‚Äôs harder to aim the plane than to just move your mouse.

creations-chat 2021-06-01 18:11:22 <@!195253906333368320>  he claims the 2008 version was taken so he replaced it with 2009 but the account that has the 2008 name in it was made after his 2009 named account was made. easy
creations-chat 2021-06-01 18:14:18 so he lied about "01accgamer2008" being taken and replacing it with 2009 because "01accgamer2008"  was made after this original account that used the number 2009, meaning when the account was made, the name 2008 could not have been taken meaning he's a liar...
creations-chat 2021-06-01 18:19:09 do vc again he was faking make him read an entire paragraph no stutter because i've heard him in vc before and he doesn't stutter
creations-chat 2021-06-01 18:31:29 there is but it's made 2 years after original account <:KEKW:670310537300672528>
creations-chat 2021-06-01 18:36:26 can you explain how you said it was a random number but then you said it was gonna be your real birthday which you said was 2008 but then it was taken so you replaced it with 2009 when you said it was just a random number <@!742022749496672256>
creations-chat 2021-06-01 18:38:52 first he said it was a random number then he said it was taken, which the account that supposedly took it was made 2 years after his "2009" account. (he's lied like 4 times this whole argument) <@!461639155911229440>  his account is 01 not 02
creations-chat 2021-06-01 18:45:49 some real, also he would barely speak in vc, he got banned from rens server for being unde 7 months ago but claimed it was a year ago because it took place in a different year <:KEKW:670310537300672528>

creations-chat 2021-07-09 19:16:41 i remember yesterday when hars got called out by 4 people so he called obc <:lmfao:527971550360633393>
creations-chat 2021-07-09 19:22:51 you say i've given up but the next message from hars after this was like 10 minutes later and it was a picture of a fucking toad.
creations-chat 2021-07-09 19:26:39 i count this experience as a solid w
creations-chat 2021-07-09 19:29:05 anyone can send an email
creations-chat 2021-07-09 20:08:44 you should get a job as those school counselors who do nothing. i can get mad at him all i want, and he gave me a reason to get mad so i don't know why you are acting like i'm just targeting him for no reason. i get it that we shouldn't argue but i have a reason to be mad so if you would accept my offer to shut the fuck up id appreciate it.
creations-chat 2021-07-09 20:11:03 also WHAT THE FUCK you talking about mind your own business
creations-chat 2021-07-09 20:14:40 <:lmfao:527971550360633393>  i know what it means. if you missed the point, i was nudging to the point that this is my business and the person who told me to mind my business is doing the COMPLETE OPPOSITE
creations-chat 2021-07-09 20:24:29 no one laughs
creations-chat 2021-07-09 20:26:30 that doesn't count
creations-chat 2021-07-09 22:48:17 my point is you don't mind your own. you come in the argument that has nothing to do with you then you act like a bitch.
creations-chat 2021-07-09 22:50:43 it's more of my argument than it is yours so i don't know why you are telling me to mind my own business
creations-chat 2021-07-09 22:55:54 you haven't stopped also just because he's your friend doesn't make it your business <@!588596347272167456>  dm me
creations-chat 2021-07-09 22:59:04 then why are you shaming me telling me to "mind my own business" when you are doing the exact thing to a worse extent
creations-chat 2021-07-09 23:04:43 i did this 2 days in a row. and tbh i haven't been on here in like a month. also if you care so much then tell your boy friend hars to stop being such a baby and that he's allowed to judge peoples builds with shit as long as he doesn't CALL FUCKING ADMINS WHEN SOMEONE SAYS HES HAS EXPOSED MOTORS
creations-chat 2021-07-09 23:07:04 yeah what the hell is that about this stopped like a while ago then you start it
creations-chat 2021-07-09 23:09:22 called him out for crying about us saying he has exposed motor lock so he calls admin you can. <@!221487880487436288>  also if you tell me to go outside then go outside yourself you was playing roblox for 7 hours straight today and if you were wondering why i didn't respond for 2 hours it was because i was outside you dumb shit
creations-chat 2021-07-09 23:12:06 are you telling me he turning himself in for starting an argument. wow he's such a nice guy i guess, now i know why you started dating him
creations-chat 2021-07-09 23:15:21 if he's such a rule follower then how come he's calling builds "fucking disgusting" which is indeed toxic, and my apparently unwanted comments on your relationship and just an addition to my messages, i have yet to make a full response based off of your relationship so it's not a main point
creations-chat 2021-07-09 23:17:54 if you didn't get the point, the message in the image is SARCASM ever heard of it
creations-chat 2021-07-09 23:20:16 it's funny you tell me to take this with a grain of salt but i make a joke about you being homosexual then you get all serious
creations-chat 2021-07-09 23:22:39 funny how you tell me to do all this shit but then you fail to do it also. even when the shit i say is sooo light but you still manage to write a paragraph disproving you are in a relationship with hars after i make a stupid joke about it. i win
creations-chat 2021-07-09 23:27:08 i know more about grass than how to win internet arguments. if you wanna know about grass and the outdoors then just hmu
creations-chat 2021-07-09 23:29:43 ok and. you obviously didn't bike today judging by how long you been keeping this argument going and your 7 hours in roblox time stamp earlier
creations-chat 2021-07-09 23:31:46 <@!221487880487436288>  after going on a bike trip with his dad for his 8th birthday yesterday
creations-chat 2021-07-09 23:35:28 ok fine i have a confession. i apologize calling hars the lowest level of being this morning.


because today i learned a valuable lesson. 

that hars isn't even that bad compared to this <@!221487880487436288>  dude like rlly bro i said i know a lot about grass then you spew your life story about how you have been living in a nat geo documentary like bruhhhhh <:lmfao:527971550360633393>
creations-chat 2021-07-09 23:38:59 LMAO THIS IS SO FUNNY you saying i give you content BUT ALL I GOTTA SAY IS I KNOW A LOt ABOUT GRASS and you SAY YOUR ENTIRE GAMING SETUP, YOUR DAILY ROUTINE AND YOUR FAMILY LIFE SITUATION LIKE BRO HOOOOW IM GETTING SO ENTERTAINED
creations-chat 2021-07-09 23:41:36 the only thing we need now is your bike manufacturer name and some other things then we will know your whole story thanks for the entertainment man and don't forget to "take it with a grain of salt"
creations-chat 2021-07-09 23:43:37 yeah shut up we already know half of your life, you are like my best friend now i know so much about you.
creations-chat 2021-07-09 23:45:55 hell nah man i got a ton of stuff to remember i might just have to write it down
creations-chat 2021-07-09 23:48:32 i like how you just assume my routine but luckily for me i don't need to assume yours because you spilled it out for everyone to see LOL
creations-chat 2021-07-09 23:51:16 my life isn't even lame, the lamest part is just hearing your bullshit daily routine. also you say reply if you love me. that's some proof that you are pretty lonely and need someone to love. what's up? hars isn't filling that void for you?
creations-chat 2021-07-09 23:55:22 thanks to you, this is still going on. also sorry pal, i'm not into guys i'm gonna have to reject your offer. also saying your intentions isnt really the smartest thing and i'm assuming the reason you love nature so much and that you aren't the brightest in the bunch that you do indeed live in the middle of south dakota and wear overalls and take a shower whenever your mom decides you are lowering the property value of the house by being in it
creations-chat 2021-07-09 23:57:38 tf is fast food land. could have came up with a real place like i did with south fucking dakota . also a reeking smell damaging the walls and causing mold is considered damage
creations-chat 2021-07-09 23:59:46 alan better slow down before he accidentally gives out his credit card info after someone brings up something about their low credit score.
creations-chat 2021-07-10 00:01:49 sorry man in "fast food land" you can get a credit card at any age. also you look real stupid rn so fuckoff because your cows need milked
creations-chat 2021-07-10 00:04:22 yeah yeah you the guy at the super market to have a 3 hour conversation about how much you love organic with the cashier because they buy the same kind of butter as you
creations-chat 2021-07-10 00:06:23 just ignore like you been tryna say to everyone else an hour ago. or fuck off like i suggested
creations-chat 2021-07-10 00:08:25 apparently not because i did bounce 3 hours ago but guess who pings me a few hours later
creations-chat 2021-07-10 00:10:56 the point was if i ignore they will come back so how about they leave this time
creations-chat 2021-07-10 00:12:57 how many. i've been in like 3 not including the unde dude


it was a question

this is the same argument <@!195253906333368320>
creations-chat 2021-07-10 00:15:46 i'm allowed to have input too so i'm just gonna say 

it wasn't a joke, what was a joke was me saying i'm a grass expert and all the comments about you the past hour after you give out your life story after i mention grass


so in conclusion, imma stop arguing and i think <@!221487880487436288>  is kinda stupid
creations-chat 2021-07-10 00:22:46 no i'm just saying we can go our separate ways but that doesn't mean i like you so cya later i kinda hope i don't cya later but still
creations-chat 2021-07-10 02:11:22 ok

creations-chat 2021-07-19 14:53:04 <@!683040274951176197>  that thing is so cool. i like those things that look like mid flaps around the hover engines or whatever you call those
creations-chat 2021-07-19 15:01:29 that's really good, the only things i could suggest are the dihedral wings
creations-chat 2021-07-19 15:03:31 yeah, the hard part will probably be making the engines stay straight up while the wings are angled
creations-chat 2021-07-19 15:05:33 that would work unless you can manage to stick a motor in between the engine and wing
