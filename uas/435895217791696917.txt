help 2019-08-22 02:57:57 is building a helicopter based on irl physics?
help 2019-08-22 02:58:20 aw well dang ive been building it wrong
help 2019-08-22 04:46:01 i need help building a good heli T_T
help 2019-08-22 04:59:07 dont even think that will work
help 2019-08-22 05:00:00 same, but i need help on rotors
help 2019-08-22 05:00:58 yes
help 2019-08-22 05:01:52 i mean yea because of the physics of it
help 2019-08-22 05:03:00 thats why i use wing panels with motors
help 2019-08-22 05:04:05 no, actually its how it is irl, you put motors on the sides of the block with panels and you can change where its angled
help 2019-08-22 05:05:44 nono, for a helicopter, its rotors are basically a plane's wings, its spinning instead of being fixed, and the way they gain altitude is by angling the blades
help 2019-08-22 05:07:50 no, they are like flat if they are trying to hover, and then when they want to change altitude they are angled, its not angled immediately otherwise it would spin the heli, there is a rotor that turns the blades sideways
help 2019-08-22 05:08:29 its wat im trying to do for my heli, BuT iT nO wOrK
help 2019-08-22 05:11:03 nvm it works i just had wrong configuration
help 2019-08-22 05:11:12 now i need to worry about weight
help 2019-08-22 05:13:44 yep i definately figured it out
help 2019-08-22 05:14:04 welp ima work on this tommorrow

help 2019-08-22 05:24:33 yea, so long as the center of mass is below the roto, u are fine
help 2019-08-22 05:24:40 rotor*
help 2019-08-23 01:36:37 so for a helicopter, is it actually impossible to make it hover perfectly?

help 2019-08-23 01:50:51 ?
help 2019-08-23 01:51:20 send screenshot of it
help 2019-08-23 01:52:11 ooooh

creations-chat 2019-11-03 16:50:39 Yes comrade, we will beat the germans back

help 2019-11-22 01:07:15 If you are going to do something like that then have some sort of correctional thrusters on the front so it doesnt dive bomb towards the ground and if you're gonna vtol THAT, then good luck
help 2020-03-07 05:42:04 what does the drag do for hover engines?
