The Tale of somewhat_sleepy (514333972189151233)
help 2020-09-14 16:56:05 Does anyone got an idea of how to make an eccentric/cam?
help 2020-09-14 16:58:43 Also you can just use an anchored block to keep the pad on the ground.
help 2020-09-14 16:58:56 Or ballast.
help 2020-09-15 00:56:48 Why can't I make a working v engine block?
creations-chat 2020-09-15 01:06:06 Now paint the motors
creations-chat 2020-09-15 14:36:57 
help 2020-09-15 18:15:48 Look up motor lock gun
creations-chat 2020-09-16 04:24:36 i think i might use that torpedo design but convert it to a drop bomb
creations-chat 2020-09-16 04:24:46 anyone got a good bomb tail design?
creations-chat 2020-09-16 04:25:18 pistons
creations-chat 2020-09-16 04:25:23 steam pistons
creations-chat 2020-09-16 04:25:41 make an exposed steam engine
creations-chat 2020-09-16 04:27:16 you could incorporate the steam locomotive piston design and make a vertical version for the steampunk machine
creations-chat 2020-09-16 04:28:03 and then hide the suspension block
creations-chat 2020-09-16 04:49:49 <@!319998854982270977> Here are 2 steam engine designs, one vertical and one horizontal. Red = Anchored Block. Dark Gray = Fixed Component. Light Gray = Moving Component.
creations-chat 2020-09-16 04:50:46 https://gyazo.com/49fb2dba87d4056714e8c42853ffd9b7
Here's a gif of the engines functioning.
creations-chat 2020-09-16 04:52:21 You can remove one of the pistons and the flywheel and just have a single cylinder engine.
creations-chat 2020-09-16 04:53:30 The engines I designed are meant so that the suspension blocks are able to be concealed so you don't see the blue springs.
creations-chat 2020-09-16 04:53:53 You could probably use motor lock if you know how to do it right.
creations-chat 2020-09-16 04:54:51 Also I just noticed that I forgot to complete the counterweights on the horizontal engine.
creations-chat 2020-09-16 04:55:32 The engines I designed are meant more to be for show, as you can see by the flywheels.
creations-chat 2020-09-16 04:56:13 You mean 0.2RPM
creations-chat 2020-09-16 04:56:26 Wait oh
creations-chat 2020-09-16 04:56:29 I'm dumber
creations-chat 2020-09-16 04:56:40 I meant 0.2RPS
creations-chat 2020-09-16 04:57:55 My steam engines run at about 96 RPM
creations-chat 2020-09-16 04:58:48 Has anyone figured out how fast 1 speed is?
creations-chat 2020-09-16 04:59:07 No velocity of 1
creations-chat 2020-09-16 05:02:00 Apparently a stud is 5cm.
creations-chat 2020-09-16 05:02:37 So the player travels at 4mph while running.
creations-chat 2020-09-16 05:03:07 And the default plane flies at something like 20mph
creations-chat 2020-09-16 05:04:44 Well at that speed my Gotha Bomber travels at about 80mph.
creations-chat 2020-09-16 05:06:15 So basically one stud per second is equivalent to about 1 kilometer per hour.
creations-chat 2020-09-16 05:07:40 Subsonic planes.
creations-chat 2020-09-16 05:08:59 Damn the irl kamikaze plane is twice as fast as the ingame planes people make tutorials of.
creations-chat 2020-09-16 05:09:36 And wow my triplane is slow as hell.
creations-chat 2020-09-16 05:10:47 The triplane I made to scale travels at like half the speed of the actual Fokker Triplane.
creations-chat 2020-09-16 05:14:59 bruh all planes in the game made to scale travel half as fast as the real ones
creations-chat 2020-09-16 05:16:30 The tutorial b-17 travels at like 120 mph while the real thing travels at nearly 300 mph.
creations-chat 2020-09-16 05:17:12 But studs are like feet
creations-chat 2020-09-16 05:17:21 1 sps is like 1 kph
creations-chat 2020-09-16 05:18:13 if a stud was a 20th of a meter then everything travels super slow
creations-chat 2020-09-16 05:19:08 wait
creations-chat 2020-09-16 05:19:18 little people
creations-chat 2020-09-16 05:19:33 ah a model plane would be slow
creations-chat 2020-09-16 05:20:08 20 mph for a plane the size of a model plane probably makes sense
creations-chat 2020-09-16 05:20:19 for like some of the faster planes
creations-chat 2020-09-16 05:20:47 Roblox is slow and small.
creations-chat 2020-09-16 05:21:29 Just average stud to average human height of 5 ft
creations-chat 2020-09-16 05:21:37 then everything makes sense
creations-chat 2020-09-16 05:22:14 lets not measure in beeg legos
creations-chat 2020-09-16 05:23:06 i don't like using 5cm legos to base my speeds and sizes it just confuses me
creations-chat 2020-09-16 05:24:07 Isn't a conveyer belt just a long wheel?
creations-chat 2020-09-16 05:25:08 A tired wheel is a wheel or wheels covered by a tire.
creations-chat 2020-09-16 05:25:30 You could have a car wheel where the metal wheel was actually smaller wheels.
creations-chat 2020-09-16 05:26:58 Modern fighter planes can't fly without their computers.
creations-chat 2020-09-16 14:02:42 By the way what do flaps do again?
creations-chat 2020-09-16 14:08:05 wait are we allowed to post gyazo links in <#384025409945337856>
creations-chat 2020-09-16 14:10:33 it auto delets it
creations-chat 2020-09-16 14:10:50 But here is the link
https://gyazo.com/79c0a752f8d4ca79a8afa6032ad9fb32
creations-chat 2020-09-16 14:12:48 Its cool when you turn of automatic controls because then you can do flips and rolls without the need of a propeller or thruster to do so.
creations-chat 2020-09-16 14:24:49 <@!516385356006817792> I took your torpedo design and converted it into a simple drop bomb.
creations-chat 2020-09-16 14:49:07 Anyone invent eccentrics yet?
creations-chat 2020-09-16 14:50:21 bruh inventor lel
creations-chat 2020-09-16 15:10:44 https://discordapp.com/channels/384021699466756103/504436696021204992/750437062993379401
This is useful
creations-chat 2020-09-16 15:13:52 Now how do I make the linkage
creations-chat 2020-09-16 15:18:12 Steam train linkage
creations-chat 2020-09-16 15:18:18 This
creations-chat 2020-09-16 15:18:58 Its what Antelope made a while ago
creations-chat 2020-09-16 15:19:06 the channel link
creations-chat 2020-09-16 15:20:06 I think the screenshot I took is how the thing was assembled.
creations-chat 2020-09-16 18:23:11 need to make the wings thicker
creations-chat 2020-09-16 18:28:20 I am using half blocks and motor lock
creations-chat 2020-09-16 18:36:00 Powah
help 2020-09-16 20:08:31 how do i connect the motor to the wheel here?
creations-chat 2020-09-16 20:49:08 https://gyazo.com/a31925ab0115ef8ed9c68949838577e4
I did it
creations-chat 2020-09-16 20:50:02 So ladders act as connectors that phase through blocks.
creations-chat 2020-09-17 05:22:02 https://gyazo.com/f15cb684b58c5e39bbda2050c207cbd1
I'm working on something.
creations-chat 2020-09-17 05:29:41 Mmm yes...collision.
creations-chat 2020-09-17 14:22:23 https://gyazo.com/6c39346d62ecba1f6cda8ab688ef5aaf
I added the cylinder.
creations-chat 2020-09-17 14:23:13 If you can figure out how to recreate the eccentric rods, sure.
creations-chat 2020-09-17 14:26:23 Now I need to make more cylinders and valve rods yay.
creations-chat 2020-09-17 14:26:40 Valve rods are complicated
creations-chat 2020-09-17 14:26:47 They need eccentric rods
creations-chat 2020-09-17 14:26:54 But we don't have eccentrics
creations-chat 2020-09-17 14:27:19 So you need to do some weird physics breaking phasing through blocks stuff to create eccentric rods in the game.
creations-chat 2020-09-17 16:28:55 https://gyazo.com/23d1eb2ef1a475290ee1afc1a1352a89
creations-chat 2020-09-17 20:29:22 https://gyazo.com/900b649d269322e41c4edcb8f3a49cdb
creations-chat 2020-09-18 04:33:41 The test that most trains fail in this game is the incline test.
creations-chat 2020-09-18 04:35:32 going up the hill track
creations-chat 2020-09-18 04:35:51 you know that track leading up to the bridge
creations-chat 2020-09-18 04:38:53 this seems to be difficult for trains to do
creations-chat 2020-09-18 04:40:56 My 2-8-2 Mikado chassis can travel all segments of the rail.
creations-chat 2020-09-18 04:41:20 Even the sharp turns and high grade segments.
creations-chat 2020-09-18 17:22:59 It's not easy to fly a twin mustang when you only have one pilot.
creations-chat 2020-09-18 17:23:28 Its not easy to fly a twin plane in general when there's only one pilot.
creations-chat 2020-09-18 17:25:58 According to Wikipedia, the free online encyclopedia, my F-82 Twin Mustang needs 21 more rockets than I have armed on it right now.
creations-chat 2020-09-18 17:26:34 25 missiles on a single small plane.
creations-chat 2020-09-18 17:27:08 Sometimes the engines sound like dogs.
creations-chat 2020-09-18 17:28:38 Freezing and noclipping while parachuting as only a head and torso is a totally intended feature.
creations-chat 2020-09-18 17:29:14 And ladders phasing through blocks is also a totally intended feature.
creations-chat 2020-09-18 17:29:35 No like on your own build.
creations-chat 2020-09-18 17:30:10 That phasing thing is actually useful for certain things like realistic train wheels and engines.
creations-chat 2020-09-18 17:30:55 You can attach a ladder to a motor and while the motor spins the ladder can go through blocks.
creations-chat 2020-09-18 17:31:26 Ladders can go through ladders as well.
creations-chat 2020-09-18 17:32:09 no like you see here?
creations-chat 2020-09-18 17:32:34 where the cranks attach to the wheel
creations-chat 2020-09-18 17:33:22 The ladders don't have collision like motor bases.
creations-chat 2020-09-18 17:33:51 Ladders don't have block collision*
creations-chat 2020-09-18 17:35:38 https://gyazo.com/3d41dca6e8335d9ee34e652206799849
creations-chat 2020-09-18 17:35:48 See?
creations-chat 2020-09-18 17:36:01 The ladders don't collide with each other all the time.
creations-chat 2020-09-18 17:36:24 I use that to make steam engines lol.
creations-chat 2020-09-18 17:36:37 I've rejoined and it still doesn't collide.
creations-chat 2020-09-18 17:36:44 I made that engine a few days ago.
creations-chat 2020-09-18 17:37:03 Yes
creations-chat 2020-09-18 17:38:50 
creations-chat 2020-09-18 17:39:06 The only error message I see
creations-chat 2020-09-18 17:39:47 
creations-chat 2020-09-18 17:40:37 It doesn't experience any errors so it's probably something else that has to do with how ladders work in the game.
creations-chat 2020-09-19 04:52:46 I think you do it on phone.
creations-chat 2020-09-20 03:15:42 Is that a rotary or radial engine?
creations-chat 2020-09-20 03:16:41 Both look very similar, but the difference is that one spins and the other does not.
creations-chat 2020-09-20 03:16:53 Rotary engines spin, radial engines don't spin.
creations-chat 2020-09-20 03:18:22 Wait what the hell is that engine it doesn't have propellers.
creations-chat 2020-09-20 03:18:36 Is it a jet engine on the front of a plane?
creations-chat 2020-09-20 19:01:24 Because the plane is too big
creations-chat 2020-09-20 19:01:55 Because I don't have space
creations-chat 2020-09-20 19:02:11 I don't have space
creations-chat 2020-09-20 19:03:31 Ok I'll make the wings shorter
creations-chat 2020-09-20 19:03:36 How much shorter though?
creations-chat 2020-09-20 19:04:05 k I'll make them 75% the size
creations-chat 2020-09-20 19:07:03 If 50% wing size too small?
creations-chat 2020-09-20 19:13:00 you happy now?
creations-chat 2020-09-20 19:16:46 
creations-chat 2020-09-20 19:17:24 ok now i paint it and finish the interior
creations-chat 2020-09-20 19:17:43 Rn the paint is 100,100,100
creations-chat 2020-09-20 19:18:01 should i make the paint 150 or 125?
creations-chat 2020-09-20 19:18:33 ight shiny b-17 time
creations-chat 2020-09-20 19:20:10 ima also tweak the interior
creations-chat 2020-09-20 19:49:15 okay is it good now?
creations-chat 2020-09-20 19:50:38 I can't make the fuselage any longer without doing complicated stuff
creations-chat 2020-09-20 19:52:47 Bruh my vertical controls on my b-17 are reversed, so I gotta move my mouse down to pitch up.
creations-chat 2020-09-20 19:54:06 I use both manual and automatic controls.
creations-chat 2020-09-20 19:54:17 I have motor flaps and control surfaces.
creations-chat 2020-09-20 19:54:52 But because of where the control surfaces are, my mouse acts more like a yoke than the plane following where the mouse is.
creations-chat 2020-09-20 19:55:34 If I move the mouse down, the plane goes up, and if I move the mouse up, the plane goes down.
creations-chat 2020-09-20 19:56:22 No for like the control surfaces, not the motor flaps.
creations-chat 2020-09-20 19:56:31 The motor flaps are keyboard controlled.
creations-chat 2020-09-20 19:59:37 Well I mean it doesn't really bother me much, it just means my mouse cursor behave more like a mouse yoke than as the mouse as a target.
creations-chat 2020-09-20 20:09:25 How do I name the controls?
creations-chat 2020-09-20 20:09:42 Ah
creations-chat 2020-09-20 20:23:25 
creations-chat 2020-09-20 20:27:14 Engine 1 stall
Engine 2 Stall
Engine 4 Stall
creations-chat 2020-09-20 20:28:15 Make the bullet a magnet drive.
creations-chat 2020-09-20 20:29:24 No like use 2 magnets pulling each other.
creations-chat 2020-09-20 20:29:57 A magnet drive is 3 blocks long.
creations-chat 2020-09-20 20:30:04 How long is the bullet.
creations-chat 2020-09-20 20:30:31 Wait the bullet is 2 blocks long.
creations-chat 2020-09-20 20:30:46 Nevermind just use a single bullet.
creations-chat 2020-09-20 20:31:51 Ah yes, cramped spaces.
creations-chat 2020-09-21 00:37:24 If that's an AK, that magazine is way too fucked up.
creations-chat 2020-09-21 00:37:54 Unless it's supposed to be a 2-dimensional drum.
creations-chat 2020-09-21 00:38:44 AK-47 but it's very pro-government.
creations-chat 2020-09-21 00:39:44 At lest have a curved magazine.
creations-chat 2020-09-21 00:40:40 Even 16*16 pixel art of an AK has a curved magazine.
creations-chat 2020-09-21 00:41:27 See even this has a curved mag.
creations-chat 2020-09-21 00:41:50 Yes that's a minecraft texture of an ak
creations-chat 2020-09-21 00:41:57 and even it has the curved mag
creations-chat 2020-09-21 00:42:18 Oh god it's even worse.
creations-chat 2020-09-21 00:43:20 <@!710208141144489995> Please at least fix the mag first it hurts to see a straight mag on an AK
creations-chat 2020-09-21 03:27:50 you use a computer to control planes like those
creations-chat 2020-09-21 03:27:59 not manual controls
creations-chat 2020-09-21 03:28:26 no not manual nor cursor control
creations-chat 2020-09-21 03:28:36 onboard computer controls
creations-chat 2020-09-21 03:29:13 has someone made an automated plane in this game?
creations-chat 2020-09-21 05:24:50 Yo how do I make a pumpjack?
creations-chat 2020-09-21 05:26:05 Those things they use to get oil.
creations-chat 2020-09-21 05:26:41 Kind of like an oil rig but on land.
creations-chat 2020-09-21 05:27:11 
creations-chat 2020-09-21 05:27:16 This thing
creations-chat 2020-09-21 05:27:47 Those things you find all over Arabia
creations-chat 2020-09-21 15:42:30 hmm i think ill make a paddle boat
creations-chat 2020-09-21 15:56:52 how's this for a paddle wheel?
creations-chat 2020-09-21 15:57:15 Because it's a paddleboat
creations-chat 2020-09-21 15:57:45 It's like asking why the bottoms of ships were red
creations-chat 2020-09-21 15:58:30 
creations-chat 2020-09-21 15:58:44 That paddlewheel looks pretty red to me.
creations-chat 2020-09-21 15:59:14 Paddleboat typically refers to riverboats.
creations-chat 2020-09-21 15:59:36 Paddle steamer typically refers to marine ships with paddlewheels.
creations-chat 2020-09-21 16:06:49 I'm making a stern-mounted paddle boat.
creations-chat 2020-09-21 16:06:56 Not a side wheel one
creations-chat 2020-09-21 16:11:57 
creations-chat 2020-09-21 16:12:54 what im using as primary inspiration for the design
creations-chat 2020-09-21 16:13:14 my steamboat
creations-chat 2020-09-21 16:13:19 and yes it is that game
creations-chat 2020-09-21 16:48:08 
creations-chat 2020-09-21 16:51:36 *Hissing noises.*
creations-chat 2020-09-21 16:53:57 Now to make the boilers
creations-chat 2020-09-21 16:54:14 Top speed of 20
creations-chat 2020-09-21 16:54:26 I bet it's gonna get slower
creations-chat 2020-09-21 17:15:05 I added boilers and now it moves fast forward but slow backwards
creations-chat 2020-09-21 17:15:21 Which in a way is kinda realistic
creations-chat 2020-09-21 17:15:41 Steam vehicles typically had a higher top speed moving forwards than they did moving backwards.
creations-chat 2020-09-21 17:15:49 Both trains and ships.
creations-chat 2020-09-21 17:17:36 The advantage of steam over sail is that they don't have to make a full 180 degree turn to go the other direction.
creations-chat 2020-09-21 17:17:45 Also that they don't rely on wind.
creations-chat 2020-09-21 17:18:01 ikr
creations-chat 2020-09-21 17:18:43 As long as you have fuel and water you can basically travel whever you wnat.
creations-chat 2020-09-21 17:19:13 Meanwhile Normans waiting for 6 months for the wind to change direction to invade England.
creations-chat 2020-09-21 17:19:47 The most dangerous things about steam are heat and pressure.
creations-chat 2020-09-21 17:20:11 Too much heat will lead to too much PSI and an explosion.
creations-chat 2020-09-21 17:20:40 <#384027830192832513>
creations-chat 2020-09-21 17:21:15 Boiler explosions are typically the most risky things about steam engines.
creations-chat 2020-09-21 17:21:47 
creations-chat 2020-09-21 17:22:42 That picture is why there are pressure gauges.
creations-chat 2020-09-21 17:24:00 According to Wikipedia, the free online encyclopedia, the boiler of a train exploded, causing it to be thrown into the air and the train landed on top of another train.

creations-chat 2020-09-22 14:05:11 What's the best material for a water propeller?
creations-chat 2020-09-22 14:16:30 
creations-chat 2020-09-22 14:37:43 Damn my steamboat takes forever to turn
creations-chat 2020-09-22 15:35:00 ok it back to actually moving
creations-chat 2020-09-22 15:50:34 So apparently paddlewheels are made of steel.
creations-chat 2020-09-22 15:50:41 So that's why they're painted red.
creations-chat 2020-09-22 15:51:18 No like the paddlewheels of steamboats.
creations-chat 2020-09-22 15:51:39 Like the riverboats and marine ships before the screw propeller.
creations-chat 2020-09-22 15:51:59 The same reason why the bottom of a ship's hull is red.
creations-chat 2020-09-22 15:52:21 Because water likely.
creations-chat 2020-09-22 15:52:30 You paint metal so it doesn't rust.
creations-chat 2020-09-22 15:56:52 The red paint they use on ships is designed to slow the speed the steel rusts because the water speeds up the rusting process.
creations-chat 2020-09-22 15:57:49 When ships used to have copper hulls instead of steel.
creations-chat 2020-09-22 15:58:24 So they just painted the steel red because they were familiar with the red bottoms of copper ships.
creations-chat 2020-09-22 15:58:34 Before they used steel hulls though.
creations-chat 2020-09-22 15:58:38 It was copper.
creations-chat 2020-09-22 15:58:58 Wait no they painted the copper red.
creations-chat 2020-09-22 15:59:34 Before they made the hulls of ships of steel they were made of copper and they painted the copper red.
creations-chat 2020-09-22 16:00:15 To prevent a patina forming and barnacles they used the red paint.
creations-chat 2020-09-22 16:00:37 And when they transitioned to steel they continued to use the red paint to prevent rust and barnacles.
creations-chat 2020-09-22 16:01:34 But either way the reason a ship's hull is red and paddle wheels are red is because they are made of metal.
creations-chat 2020-09-22 18:48:35 You need more of it.

creations-chat 2020-09-23 05:19:17 So where am I gonna get all that power from?
creations-chat 2020-09-23 05:20:31 But to make solar panels I need to make silicon wafers, and to make those I need a lot of electric power.
creations-chat 2020-09-23 05:21:03 Also I just realized that my pumpjack is slowing moving across the ground.

creations-chat 2020-09-27 05:31:52 Probably because it doesn't have valve gear.
creations-chat 2020-09-27 05:33:14 Making valve gear for steam engines overcomplicates them and and make them finicky, like the Mikado chassis I made or the marine steam engine I made.

The bigger engine I made is able to actually work.
creations-chat 2020-10-08 14:37:40 I know.
creations-chat 2020-10-08 14:38:18 Spinning an engine is purely decorational.
creations-chat 2020-10-08 14:38:57 The things that go up and down less than the pistons?
creations-chat 2020-10-08 14:39:18 Those are the valves.
creations-chat 2020-10-08 14:39:50 They are what allow the steam to drive the pistons.
creations-chat 2020-10-08 14:41:28 Well the valves allow the pistons to continuously turn.
creations-chat 2020-10-08 14:42:06 The first steam engine was an atmospheric engine, which was really slow and inefficient because it relied on the air to push the piston back down.
creations-chat 2020-10-08 14:42:23 It was also very heavy, which made it basically impossible to use on ships.
creations-chat 2020-10-08 14:43:55 The valve gear allows the valve to automatically reset the piston.
creations-chat 2020-10-08 14:48:05 One of the main problems I have is finding a ship to incorporate the engine into, as practically all marine vessels from 1914 and on used steam turbines instead of reciprocating steam engines.
creations-chat 2020-10-08 14:48:38 And around some time after that those were mostly replaced by diesel engines.
creations-chat 2020-10-08 14:50:38 The most notable ships I am aware of that used reciprocating engines still in the 1910s and on were the Olympic Class Ocean Liners, but they had 2 sets of 4 cylinder engines for the side propellers and used a steam turbine to drive the main propeller.
creations-chat 2020-10-08 14:51:33 Parsons turbine literally replacing everything steamship.
creations-chat 2020-10-08 15:38:00 I now made it a "triple expansion" engine.
creations-chat 2020-10-08 15:40:50 What I mean by "triple expansion" is that it isn't actually a triple expansion engine, because all the pistons move at the same time.

Depending on factors, the clipping may result in the thing just passing through but slowing down, or the thing may do what I like to call a snap clipping where the thing just instantaneously clips through a wall of blocks usually due to jamming on something.

creations-chat 2020-12-05 06:09:42 It uses a single eccentric held in place usually by a single bearing around the crankshaft. Each bucket is attached to the crankshaft by pivots, rather than being held rigidly in place like with a standard paddlewheel. Attached to each bucket is a rotating arm connected to the eccentric. The motion of the crankshaft causes the eccentric to move and hold the buckets in the position they are currently in, which is vertical, so they remain vertical while in motion.

bug-reports 2020-12-16 03:18:59 So, I don't think it's really a bug, but powered motors gyrate slightly. The oscillation isn't really noticable with short distances, and seems to go away when using another unpowered or reversed motor as a stabilizer, but it becomes quite noticeable with long distances of a spinning rotor with no support bearings.

creations-chat 2021-01-31 04:23:29 Well, the downward angle probably follows the principle of gull wings, minus the hard bend gull part of course. If you look at say, a WW2 monoplane fighter with the wings attached toward the bottom of the fuselage, you'll notice that the wings are angled slightly upwards, so the location of the wing relative to the fuselage probably affects it's angle.

creations-chat 2021-03-18 16:41:09 The tutorial B-17 doesn't even have an underside turret. Sure early B-17Es didn't have a ball turret but they did have a remote controlled underbelly turret which after a few hundred B-17Es were produced was replaced by a ball turret.
creations-chat 2021-03-18 16:44:10 I think even the prototype of the B-17 had some kind of underside gunner position, and it wasn't until the B-17E that the tail gunner position existed.

creations-chat 2021-12-22 23:25:10 So I got bored and decided to make a tank gun.
creations-chat 2021-12-22 23:28:29 First I got to think of a turret. Kind of thinking Pershing turret.
creations-chat 2021-12-22 23:32:32 The only notable thing about the tank gun I made is that it can recoil.
creations-chat 2021-12-22 23:45:16 Not yet

creations-chat 2021-12-25 02:45:42 alternative lopsided turret design
creations-chat 2021-12-25 02:57:44 I made it not lopsided and added hatches and radio antennae. Better?
creations-chat 2021-12-25 03:01:02 no more like late interwar/early ww2
creations-chat 2021-12-25 03:03:22 And that's what the extension thing is supposed to cover, because I cannot push the gun back half a block without removing the commander and completely redesigning the positions of the gunner and loader
creations-chat 2021-12-25 03:12:54 okay, this better? the weird protrusion in front of the gunner hatch is required for the redesign to work, you can take with that what you want
creations-chat 2021-12-25 03:25:11 periscopes too? now does it look like a proper tank turret?
creations-chat 2021-12-25 03:29:04 which hole
creations-chat 2021-12-25 03:39:10 well this is the best i can do without having a elevation of 0 degrees and i also added a crude turret basket
creations-chat 2021-12-25 03:42:45 none of the crew actually sit in the basket
creations-chat 2021-12-25 03:46:37 in fact because of that fact that all the crew fit outside the basket i have made the turret basket the ammo rack
creations-chat 2021-12-25 03:51:17 carousel ammo rack like the valentine tank except it's an even smaller rack because the turret is large enough to house the entire crew, therefor there is no need for a wide basket and i can fit the turret on a narrower tank
creations-chat 2021-12-25 03:56:36 does the gun elevate though?

creations-chat 2021-12-28 07:16:02 and this time the crew will be partially inside the turret basket instead of on top of it
creations-chat 2021-12-28 07:20:16 my behemoth tog3-like tank had 3 of the 4 turret crew sitting inside the turret above the basket because the tank is very large, the medium/heavy tank i was previously making had all 3 crew sitting above the basket which was instead used as an ammo rack, so in a way yes this is the first time i made a tank turret with all the crew sitting inside the actual turret basket

creations-chat 2021-12-29 06:32:21 added fuel tanks and more interior paint, oh and when i finish the hull i'm going to make a crane to put the turret onto the hull like i did with my tog3 thing

creations-chat 2021-12-29 07:40:55 even better i can actually modify the hull to have an aircraft carrier deck <:trollface:775024642104229898>
creations-chat 2021-12-29 07:44:54 if you want to use it as a super heavy infantry support tank you can, if you want to use it as an aircraft carrier or bridge you can, if you want to put an fv4005 turret on it you can (fun fact the fv4005 turret doesn't have a turret basket because of the height)
creations-chat 2021-12-29 07:47:59 people crying when they see exposed motors on the wings and tail to allow for functional controls surfaces well my tfb avenger does have working ailerons and flaps and i managed to hide the motors responsible for those in the fuselage but as you can see in order to do that you need control cables
creations-chat 2021-12-29 07:52:55 marked the control cable and aileron said conrol cable, this is why people just use an exposed motor

creations-chat 2022-09-25 15:17:08 *Like?*
creations-chat 2022-09-25 15:22:15 I didn't use angle lock on the armor plate and there will be incorrect proportions due to the nature of it trying to cram enough space to fit 4 people inside while the commander can just poke his head out the top, but I can consider other detailing

<@884290997129998408> It does have exhaust (split into 2 trails on either side right adjacent to the tracks) but I'll consider adding those other things to it
creations-chat 2022-09-25 15:30:02 Should I use sparklers for headlights?
creations-chat 2022-09-25 15:40:11 Do these work for headlights?
creations-chat 2022-09-25 15:43:03 There really isn't any room to move the turret forward unfortunately without basically scrapping the entire design and rebuilding from scratch
creations-chat 2022-09-25 15:49:39 Sherman doesn't have a shell ejector but it does have a pistol port which I did add but need to change rotation
creations-chat 2022-09-25 16:07:39 Suggested colors for livery for my Sherman it's already green but apparently that's not enough
creations-chat 2022-09-25 16:46:52 Okay I've added headlights and some more detailing but I don't now how to make this traveling lock and still don't know a good paint scheme to use

creations-chat 2022-10-14 05:48:21 I should also probably note that this is what the interior of the turret looks like, the interior of the hull is no different but the turret is slightly less cramped than the Sherman turret

I recommend using a smoke/snow pipe for the sponsons and then modifying the hull very slightly so the pipe only welds to the motor and gun

creations-chat 2022-12-03 23:24:00 If the scale is 1 block = 1 meter, the scale is roughly 1:1.4 because 1 block in the game is roughly equal to 0.7~.77 meters

I recommend using springs that have weld break disabled and autoretract enabled for simple small scale recoiling guns. You can conceal the spring through a variety of ways and use text blocks to connect the free end of the spring to the barrel, and even armor the rocket/firework. There just needs to be internal space for the mechanism
