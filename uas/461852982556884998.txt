bug-reports 2021-06-24 05:06:48 I think quite a number of people are aware of this, but suspension blocks glitch a lot (I mean, *a lot*), especially while the plane is in flight, and they sometimes even get tangled together.

creations-chat 2021-06-30 04:46:23 question: do yall think that this kind of twin tail airliner design be weird?
edit: please ignore my habit of somehow making the ailerons go up while leaving the pilot seat
creations-chat 2021-06-30 04:48:52 in that case imma give it a fix over the weekend

creations-chat 2021-07-04 07:52:04 that pretty much happens all the time

but some people really do be tired of giving feedback because when they do, the creator basically rages at the constructive criticism and that also happens a lot
creations-chat 2021-07-04 10:07:54 its not a white plot, the white lines at the sides are those of the other plots
