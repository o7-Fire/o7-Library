plane-crazy 2019-11-26 02:22:00 I'm not what you'd call much of a builder.
plane-crazy 2019-11-26 02:21:24 We still need the planters peanut man.

plane-crazy 2019-11-26 02:17:17 So we need to build a giant flying planters peanut man?
plane-crazy 2019-11-26 02:16:38 I don't help exist.
plane-crazy 2019-09-04 04:57:18 Savoic here's an idea. delet wheel
plane-crazy 2019-09-04 04:44:07 who wants to trade. my 500kbps wifi for your not 500kbps wifi
plane-crazy 2019-09-04 00:09:44 I rest my case.
plane-crazy 2019-09-04 00:09:28 Looking like that?
plane-crazy 2019-09-04 00:09:10 Also who will actually use them?
plane-crazy 2019-09-04 00:08:25 They could be better tho
plane-crazy 2019-09-04 00:07:56 They're interesting
plane-crazy 2019-09-04 00:05:03 Long press
plane-crazy 2019-09-04 00:03:47 It's awful
plane-crazy 2019-09-04 00:03:26 The wifi where i'm at currently averages 500kbps
plane-crazy 2019-09-04 00:03:04 You know whats sad?
plane-crazy 2019-09-04 00:01:19 500kbps wifi
plane-crazy 2019-08-29 06:43:51 I'll be taking that fan
plane-crazy 2019-08-29 06:41:31 ~~i prefer tortuga~~
plane-crazy 2019-08-29 06:40:44 Much better
plane-crazy 2019-08-29 06:40:40 I'd rather dry temp.
plane-crazy 2019-08-29 06:40:31 humidity makes heat so much worse
plane-crazy 2019-08-29 06:40:16 that makes it worse.
plane-crazy 2019-08-29 06:39:16 man... that episode was really hot it had to be like 120 outside with like 80% humidity
plane-crazy 2019-08-29 06:38:38 But all they find are really expensive air conditioners
plane-crazy 2019-08-29 06:38:24 this reminds me of the gintama episode where they spend all day looking for a fan
plane-crazy 2019-08-29 06:38:05 YES YOU DO
plane-crazy 2019-08-29 06:37:54 your advice sucks now donate me a fan >:U
plane-crazy 2019-08-29 06:37:24 Actually when it's too hot to sleep my eyes puff up real bad
plane-crazy 2019-08-29 06:36:55 It's fuckin awful
plane-crazy 2019-08-29 06:36:42 none and subwoofer at 11
plane-crazy 2019-08-29 06:36:37 the only vacuum I have has 2 noise settings
plane-crazy 2019-08-29 06:36:21 that's loud as hell
plane-crazy 2019-08-29 06:35:33 someone donate me a fan quick it's too hot to sleep
plane-crazy 2019-08-28 18:04:51 If it isn't full of explosives I'm disappointed
plane-crazy 2019-08-28 18:04:17 It's a creeper!
plane-crazy 2019-08-20 21:15:14 I can eat food
plane-crazy 2019-08-20 21:14:57 I was makin bad joke
plane-crazy 2019-08-20 21:14:13 ~~use unix~~
plane-crazy 2019-08-20 21:13:34 New sticker slightly better
plane-crazy 2019-08-20 21:13:17 No
plane-crazy 2019-08-20 21:13:03 Yes it is
plane-crazy 2019-08-20 21:12:38 It's one of the reasons it suuuuuucked
plane-crazy 2019-08-20 21:12:06 No. You need specisl hardware for 8
plane-crazy 2019-08-20 21:03:58 Tasty
plane-crazy 2019-08-20 21:02:59 That's the legit reason.
plane-crazy 2019-08-20 21:02:40 9 is no in german. Windows didn't wanna be made fun of so they didn't release 9.
plane-crazy 2019-08-20 21:01:47 You want 4 GB of RAM max? Me neither.
plane-crazy 2019-08-20 21:00:40 32 bit was okay. But it's RAM limitations make grown men cry.
plane-crazy 2019-08-20 20:59:28 If you aren't using 64bit OS you're garbage.
plane-crazy 2019-08-20 20:58:53 Windows 8 was so bad that windows pretty much delet this'd it.
plane-crazy 2019-08-19 20:46:42 Lol
plane-crazy 2019-08-19 20:45:35 You shouldn't >.>
plane-crazy 2019-08-14 23:48:55 such a luxury.
plane-crazy 2019-08-14 23:48:42 when you decide to talk in the plane crazy discord because we have <:Beaned:519677444316463124>
plane-crazy 2019-08-14 23:48:24 you know
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 17:51:16 No sorry, I'm dead. Bye now.
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 17:50:08 Swearing can also help you feel less stressful.
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 17:49:15 well fuck, ima swear now.
plane-crazy 2019-08-04 17:14:57 ~~enter the mecha ojama king~~
plane-crazy 2019-08-04 04:00:37 Wasn't worst.
plane-crazy 2019-08-04 04:00:08 alas, no.
plane-crazy 2019-08-04 03:59:26 Ultraws content has declined hard lately.
plane-crazy 2019-08-04 03:59:03 Was it bad?
plane-crazy 2019-08-04 03:57:20 Is it rthro?
plane-crazy 2019-08-04 03:57:15 The most important question
plane-crazy 2019-08-04 03:57:03 So it's just like retail tycoon
plane-crazy 2019-08-04 03:56:11 I have a passionate hatred for floor to ceiling windows
plane-crazy 2019-08-04 03:55:39 The windows are so... ugly...
plane-crazy 2019-08-04 03:53:50 Are those deck chairs?
plane-crazy 2019-08-04 03:53:37 Les windows
plane-crazy 2019-08-04 03:53:08 No. It really doesn't
plane-crazy 2019-08-04 03:52:58 I hate it already
plane-crazy 2019-08-04 03:52:43 I have stuff to install.
plane-crazy 2019-08-04 03:52:30 But for now
plane-crazy 2019-08-04 03:52:01 If haggie made it then I might try it.
plane-crazy 2019-08-04 03:51:37 That's fair.
plane-crazy 2019-08-04 03:50:40 I don't want a cruise ship either
plane-crazy 2019-08-04 03:50:18 Then i stopped caring.
plane-crazy 2019-08-04 03:50:02 Oh. It looked interesting til you said cruise ship tycoon
plane-crazy 2019-08-04 03:49:25 What game is that?

plane-crazy 2019-07-19 13:29:49 I've had several times where I SHOULD have broken something.
plane-crazy 2019-07-19 13:29:39 I have only ever ruptured my scalp.
plane-crazy 2019-07-19 13:26:13 Meaning it sucks.
plane-crazy 2019-07-19 13:25:50 Cause you know. Windows 7 ultimate SP1 is just that... SP1
plane-crazy 2019-07-19 13:24:15 I have 63 more windows updates to install.
plane-crazy 2019-07-19 13:23:58 Welp
plane-crazy 2019-07-19 13:23:08 ~~Walk on it with a heavy lean.~~
plane-crazy 2019-07-19 13:22:14 Put some ice on it.
plane-crazy 2019-07-19 13:21:28 Pouring salt in a wounds a bad idea.
plane-crazy 2019-07-19 13:21:12 Neither battleship.
plane-crazy 2019-07-19 13:20:35 ~~Just ban the competition~~

plane-crazy 2019-07-19 13:15:26 A mod shouldn't take sides.
plane-crazy 2019-07-19 13:14:44 Not much.
plane-crazy 2019-07-19 13:13:58 No... Caring is not his job.
plane-crazy 2019-07-19 13:13:18 <@314383347214319616> remind me why you have to care?
plane-crazy 2019-07-19 13:11:45 Why does robo have to care <:Thonk:509498568982134816>

plane-crazy 2019-07-18 02:13:10 Intel*
plane-crazy 2019-07-18 02:13:06 Better be an intrl.
plane-crazy 2019-07-18 02:12:52 They catch fire.
plane-crazy 2019-07-17 17:40:36 Even less things work now.
plane-crazy 2019-07-17 17:40:32 you know what that means guys
plane-crazy 2019-07-17 17:40:28 Roblox updated
plane-crazy 2019-07-17 17:38:42 Round shapes aren't fun to build on plane crazy.
plane-crazy 2019-07-17 17:37:12 I don't really care about ranks.
plane-crazy 2019-07-17 17:37:07 Oh no. I just like screwing around.
plane-crazy 2019-07-17 17:36:37 "almost"
plane-crazy 2019-07-17 17:36:13 Wait. So you're saying you're not sure if a doughnut has been built?
plane-crazy 2019-07-17 17:35:36 with sprinkles***
plane-crazy 2019-07-17 17:35:21 Has the giant flying doughnut been built yet?
plane-crazy 2019-07-17 17:35:13 Wait. Quick question
plane-crazy 2019-07-17 17:35:00 I'd like to see how that functions.
plane-crazy 2019-07-17 17:34:34 and say that you don't like me.
plane-crazy 2019-07-17 17:34:29 Alright so I'm going to go out on a limb here
plane-crazy 2019-07-17 17:33:32 It actually flies pretty decent.
plane-crazy 2019-07-17 17:33:25 Do you not like my monstrosity Baris?
plane-crazy 2019-07-17 17:32:38 Honesty is the best policy.
plane-crazy 2019-07-17 17:32:31 What?
plane-crazy 2019-07-17 17:32:11 Even if it is crap.
plane-crazy 2019-07-17 17:32:07 And it was somewhat fun to build.
plane-crazy 2019-07-17 17:31:59 but it does fly.
plane-crazy 2019-07-17 17:31:56 Isn't very good.
plane-crazy 2019-07-17 17:31:54 I agree whatever that is.
plane-crazy 2019-07-17 17:31:48 And yes
plane-crazy 2019-07-17 17:30:34 I'd rather build whatever *this* is
plane-crazy 2019-07-17 17:30:03 I don't want to build that.
plane-crazy 2019-07-17 17:29:55 No.
plane-crazy 2019-07-17 17:29:31 I didn't build that.
plane-crazy 2019-07-17 17:29:08 Wait, is something actually wrong with motors?
plane-crazy 2019-07-17 17:28:33 Spare my eyes please
plane-crazy 2019-07-17 17:27:11 What a litterbug.
plane-crazy 2019-07-17 17:27:04 He took off in his plane and left all this crap behind.
plane-crazy 2019-07-17 17:19:20 And it hurt to watch
plane-crazy 2019-07-17 17:19:16 Oh yea I watched this video already
plane-crazy 2019-07-17 17:18:16 Why would you copy anything?
plane-crazy 2019-07-17 17:16:56 I mean what
plane-crazy 2019-07-17 17:16:53 Oh good. I was afraid sparc mac had started playing roblox.
plane-crazy 2019-07-17 17:16:21 So which cancer youtuber made plane crazy full of noobs?
plane-crazy 2019-07-17 17:08:56 I met someone who thought he was good cause he was modifing the tutorial plane
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 22:54:11 When the best thing on your server is *this*
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 22:48:08 As soon as I was done with the tutorial I deleted the plane forever.
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 22:47:44 there are LITERALLY 3 PEOPLE HERE TRYING TO MAKE THE TUTORIAL PLANE BETTER
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 22:47:17 Because yea.
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 22:47:11 That's why I decided not to ask them if they had any good ideas.
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 22:46:34 and I figured the best idea they had was "ADD MORE BLOCKS"
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 22:46:24 But when I looked around I saw a lot of rectanguloid planes
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 22:46:13 I was going to ask the server I was in if they had any ideas.
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 17:27:50 I'm just thinking about making something this game shouldn't be able to make.
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 17:24:54 Lol.
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 17:22:08 RUN
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 17:22:07 we have triggered the spongeblob
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 17:22:01 angery spongeblob
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 17:21:25 So it's prettymuch useless for me.
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 17:21:21 I'm not building a multistage rocket or anything.
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 17:21:01 Because I haven't made anything I'd want disconnectors for.
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 17:20:49 Never really cared to test if I was right or not.
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 17:20:42 I just assumed they were obvious for how they worked...
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 17:20:32 I can tell that.
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 17:20:29 Yea
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 17:19:57 as it is for simply getting rid of excess carry weight
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 17:19:49 It's not for launching per say
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 17:19:29 Er no
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 17:17:54 Cause there's no way the rod holds on...
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 17:17:44 That's how I assumed they worked.
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 17:17:30 In a multi-staged rocket.
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 17:17:21 I've seen them used.
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 17:17:18 I imagine they disconnect things.
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 17:17:13 but anyways.
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 17:17:12 Never actually tried using one.
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 17:17:03 Not 100% sure actually.
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 17:16:36 And he's not listening.
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 17:16:31 I'm trying to explain to this guy how disconnectors work...
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 16:09:42 Whats a motor
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 16:06:15 That card gives me PTSD
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 16:05:26 That's not how that works..
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 16:04:07 You can't deny me to be neutral.
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 16:03:26 I take no part in this
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 16:00:19 I'd rather not say anything that could get me <:Beaned:519677444316463124>
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 15:59:31 As in. No gore.
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 15:59:05 Mature adult content in most cases, but it's not limited by things such as gore.
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 15:58:08 That's not an acronym but it refers to content that isn't acceptable in a workplace.
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 15:56:32 Not safe for work
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 15:56:24 But weasels need soy.
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 15:55:43 <:Beaned:519677444316463124>
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 15:54:56 Neither do I

plane-crazy 2019-07-16 02:03:34 MY EYES
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 02:00:00 I'm not very adept with plane lingo.
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 01:59:48 Sorry my bad
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 01:55:42 It's important to keep the tri-wing propeller accurate, correct?
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 01:55:15 Anyways.
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 01:54:39 Neat.
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 01:54:28 you'll be nicer to me?
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 01:54:24 if I make a p38 that doesn't look like crap
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 01:54:17 So wait
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 01:53:40 that flies.
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 01:53:38 A p38 CAN OPENER
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 01:53:33 Better yet
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 01:53:14 a p38 sounds pretty cute.
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 01:53:11 Also
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 01:52:59 Yes but it's also a tank.
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 01:52:36 I'll exPLANE why with this pun.
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 01:52:20 I don't want to build a tank biplane...
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 01:52:13 For 1
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 01:51:42 I didn't build a flying dorito
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 01:51:36 then again...
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 01:51:26 Neat.
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 01:51:19 I have standards?
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 01:50:49 This shouldn't fly.
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 01:50:47 It's not *this* stupid looking though
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 01:50:22 stupid looking.
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 01:50:20 it's just...
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 01:50:16 I'm sure it does.
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 01:50:10 Yes but why.
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 01:49:58 Why does that fly.
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 01:49:49 And that's called you died.
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 01:49:42 that's gravity.
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 01:49:38 That's not flying
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 01:49:27 Lmao.
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 01:49:16 even if it does look retarded and extremely ineffective.
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 01:48:56 It has no reason *not* to fly.
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 01:48:48 But that Should fly.
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 01:47:52 and I'll maybe possibly consider it.
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 01:47:47 but does
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 01:47:46 Find something that shouldn't fly.
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 01:47:25 Trucc
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 01:47:21 
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 01:47:12 trucc
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 01:46:20 the p38 was cute.
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 01:46:14 but stupid.
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 01:46:12 Yes
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 01:46:02 Ok now that's a stupid idea.
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 01:45:50 that definitely shouldn't work.
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 01:45:45 I'm a fan of weird an abstract things
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 01:45:40 Too simple looking...
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 01:45:37 I didn't really care for any of them.
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 01:45:13 But I'm not a Fan of the F7F.
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 01:44:50 Alright. Do it.
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 01:43:17 better?
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 01:43:13 I'll consider it cretin.
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 01:43:01 <@163143541160148992> Also you right I was stupid and had the top propeller wrong
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 01:42:43 I'll consider it man.
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 01:41:17 I'll think about it.
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 01:39:40 *cough*
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 01:39:27 Actually it's pretty much symetrical.
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 01:38:55 It ONLY flies left.
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 01:38:51 it can't fly to the right
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 01:38:30 with no thinking.
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 01:38:26 That I built in about 2 hours
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 01:38:21 It's A mess.
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 01:38:17 It's a uh
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 01:36:52 and it flies.
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 01:36:50 It's alive
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 01:36:49 It's alive
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 01:36:44 
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 01:34:02 Exceptionally well.
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 01:33:58 Yes
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 01:32:32 with much difficulty I can.
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 01:32:28 Well
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 01:32:26 at all.
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 01:32:23 No I mean I can't turn right
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 01:30:46 which is weird af
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 01:30:42 it flies best with mousecontrol
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 01:30:36 Also strangely enough
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 01:30:25 It doesn't bank right worth a crap.
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 01:30:19 It just has one issue.
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 01:28:26 I have no idea how to fly a plane.
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 01:28:21 Can I be real with you guys?
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 01:25:56 It's going to take a while before I can fly it well.
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 01:25:49 It's difficult to control though
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 01:25:26 I've been here for 3 days.
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 01:24:27 it requires them to remain stable.
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 01:24:19 The propellers make a huge difference in stability
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 01:24:04 It flies.
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 01:23:58 and it works
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 01:23:56 I built a thing
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 01:23:25 SUCCESS!
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 01:23:23 HAHA! I GOT IT TO FLY PROPERLY!
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 01:19:23 Would you believe me if I said my contraption flies?
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 01:14:53 Durn auto keyboards
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 01:14:34 This guy wants ot go FAST
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 01:12:45 a floor.
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 01:12:44 Just.
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 01:12:32 Also I'm pretty sure I watched you build *a floor*
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 01:12:23 But that's the fun part.
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 01:12:20 Yea it is.
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 01:11:23 it's a mismatch of whatever the fuck I decided to throw together.
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 01:11:10 I know right ðŸ˜„
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 01:10:44 I built something
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 01:02:51 I think I can make it fly
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 23:33:10 I'm getting closer to finishing it.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 23:19:27 Also most of the weapons are just for flaire. I expect it to be completely combat ineffective.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 23:19:08 It's not even done...
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 23:18:06 Noice.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 23:17:47 It's not.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 23:17:32 Hey it's like 30% done
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 23:17:28 when I actually start building something entirely random.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 23:17:19 What I build out of random parts
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 23:17:14 It's uh
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 23:14:45 wouldn't say it's good...
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 23:14:38 I guess what I'm building is interesting so far.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 23:13:02 and all I got was "thanks"
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 23:12:57 I said nice pointy dorito
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 23:10:49 Is that Dorito 2.0?
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 23:09:00 on doing nothing.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 23:08:57 I also spent half the time I've been "working"
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 23:07:20 Don't expect what I build to make any logical sense
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 23:05:40 I'm not goofing around with a biplane anymore.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 23:05:30 I'm actually trying to build something now
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 23:05:24 I mean
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 23:02:33 someone is telling me I'm good at building when all I'm doing is building something completely random.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 23:02:20 Help
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 22:39:09 Earliest time in months
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 22:39:01 I woke up a 930 am
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 22:38:36 ~~biplane~~
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 20:24:31 I think.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 20:24:29 For what I want I kinda want it bigger...
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 20:24:15 My scaling is kinda small.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 20:23:41 I'm just building something random...
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 20:16:48 Boxy!
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 20:15:19 I'm just building whatever feels natural.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 20:15:12 I'm not quite sure what I'm building now
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 19:57:29 Hmm..
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 19:40:38 and that would be terrifying.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 19:40:33 I could. but then I'd have to make it bigger
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 19:40:25 I had to ban someone not that long ago.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 19:40:06 As a ban summary anyways.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 19:39:51 When it's a summary you can say pretty much whatever you want.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 19:38:58 I'm going to just say nothing.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 19:36:41 We also invented the battery long before we had a use for it. <@535018381594591253>
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 19:36:11 I haven't done anything wrong.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 19:35:51 Eventually something will work.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 19:35:45 And I'll keep trying different things.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 19:35:40 but I'm going to keep doing what I'm going to do
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 19:35:33 No I mean like. What you're telling me to do. I get it.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 19:34:21 That's exactly what I have to keep trying.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 19:33:40 I thought it looked awful and wasn't what I was really going for.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 19:33:30 Think again.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 19:33:28 If you think I thought it looked good.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 19:33:09 I'm aware that it's bad.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 19:32:38 That's all I'm looking for.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 19:32:33 I just wanted it to reach proper speed and take off.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 19:32:26 I never wanted it to fly well.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 19:32:21 The point was to make it fly.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 19:32:13 but it flies.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 19:32:10 It doesn't fly great.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 19:31:04 I was flying it earlier.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 19:30:57 It does fly.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 19:30:27 <@!295568493166985218> And I don't care what roblox thinks about what I think. Ima be me.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 19:29:07 That wouldn't work good with a turbine though...
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 19:28:57 Anything can fly.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 19:28:00 It's too big.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 19:27:50 Maybe I'll build a tiny helicopter next.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 19:27:33 I have a preference.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 19:27:29 over large overblocked clunky ones.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 19:27:22 I prefer building small planes
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 19:26:34 I'm aware of all the design problems with it.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 19:26:08 I'm stubborn af.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 19:26:06 What can I say?
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 19:25:53 I'm just too stuborn to actually not do that.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 19:25:37 I came to that conclusion 2 days ago
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 19:25:32 Well if I'm being honest
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 19:25:13 It took me 3 days to figure out it needed another propeller.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 19:25:03 No.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 19:24:58 It looks terrible.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 19:24:47 It's ugly af.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 19:24:41 xD
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 19:24:28 I like planes
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 19:23:32 ~~now that I hid an extra propeller in it~~
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 19:23:23 It flies now
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 19:20:03 That's my dinner
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 19:17:36 ~~Since I hid a propeller somewhere~~
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 19:16:54 It flies now.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 19:16:06 It's a biplane.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 19:15:31 It's actually not that small.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 19:15:12 I only build tiny things.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 19:14:53 100 blocks
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 19:14:43 Not enough oompf.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 19:14:31 Too big for my plane.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 19:14:07 Can we get a stronger propeller engine please.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 19:13:39 Balance might not be the issue
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 19:13:18 Plane crazy is nice.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 18:52:38 <:Beaned:519677444316463124>
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 18:46:26 It's that the propeller engine is just too weak.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 18:46:18 it's not that I can't build a plane
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 18:46:07 I figured out why my plane doesn't fly.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 18:45:59 guys
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 17:55:00 He invented the triangle
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 17:54:56 Oh my god
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 16:08:15 And it better weigh about 200lbs
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 16:07:59 that better be the best damn burger ever
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 14:46:47 Which is a lie.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 14:46:42 I've been playing roblox since about 08 but my account says 2012.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 14:44:36 *knock knock* FBI open up.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 14:43:23 *cough*
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 14:43:11 Yea I don't actually decline people from joining me.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 14:40:37 Literally... someone stepped on their plane and now we have whining.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 14:39:45 The server I'm in.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 14:39:26 It's literally "YOU JUMPED ON MY PLANE"
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 14:39:13 there are idiots complaining at eachother in my server.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 14:39:05 Oh no.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 14:32:49 Until then you get nothing.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 14:32:41 I'll show you guys once it works.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 14:32:22 I'm trying again.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 14:32:15 Nope.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 14:31:13 Yea I'm finding out tons of ways not to build a plane.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 14:30:10 Gross.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 14:29:31 It doesn't really do anything useful.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 14:29:25 Mouse control is garbage.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 14:29:09 I do.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 14:29:01 I'm downright awful at it.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 14:28:53 That's because I can't build ðŸ˜‚
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 14:28:03 And you're not exactly good at designing planes.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 14:27:55 Robo, It's not exactly easy when you're trying to build a functioning biplane with under 100 blocks.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 14:26:53 I was close.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 14:26:47 Oh no, I almost had one flying last night.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 14:26:07 I think it's a lift problem tbh.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 14:26:02 I think the issue isn't the single issue
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 14:25:19 It's going as good as that sounds.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 14:25:07 A single engine biplane.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 14:25:03 I'm still working on my first plane.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 14:23:40 Ima tell you that Rn.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 14:23:36 Pistons are going to be required.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 14:23:26 Admirable.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 14:23:13 I'm sure that will give you some ideas.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 14:23:07 <@456226577798135808> Just look at how an internal combustion engine is made
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 14:19:55 Another day another attempt at building planes that just ain't workin.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 14:19:43 You guys know what today is?
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 03:03:18 I don't want a lance on the front.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 03:03:01 Ew.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 02:54:33 I'm honestly trying to figure out why 1 engine isn't enough for my biplane to function.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 02:53:27 What's wrong with motors?
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 02:42:37 I thonk I'm getting closer.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 02:38:25 I'm still thonking.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 02:38:20 guys
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 02:38:08 <:Thonk:509498568982134816>
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 01:48:28 I told him it doesn't do that.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 01:48:24 Some guy begged me to fly my plane
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 01:47:21 I'm getting closer.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 01:38:26 because I think it's screwing me over.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 01:38:20 I'm going to remove the helium block and see what changes
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 01:36:47 and that I'm only using one.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 01:36:43 It doesn't help that the propeller engine is terrible
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 01:36:33 Which is what I'm trying to fix.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 01:36:24 Not really. it more-so slowly descends.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 01:35:41 Yes.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 01:35:23 My center of lift is centered with my mass.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 01:34:58 One.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 01:34:57 I have one helium block total.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 01:34:30 my center of mass is centered perfectly.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 01:34:23 I don't see how that's the issue
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 01:34:18 Funny
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 01:33:15 It makes an excellent land rover.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 01:33:06 Correct.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 01:32:58 I want it to Fly. not float.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 01:32:48 The plane IS balanced.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 01:32:40 Also it's not nessecarily "heavy" per say.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 01:32:29 That's not what I want it to do.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 01:31:46 And that's in a major spot.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 01:31:41 I already have a helium block to account for the backend being extremely heavy.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 01:31:16 Because I don't have many blocks I can actually put helium on.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 01:30:48 It literally ends up nose down.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 01:30:39 Which doesn't work at all.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 01:30:34 is the plane just floats off via the backside.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 01:30:26 So what happens when you turn the rear into helium
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 01:29:31 It can't even get off the ground so far.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 01:29:22 It's a single engine biplane.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 01:29:02 Yes.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 01:28:54 the problem is testing it doesn't do as much as you think it does.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 01:28:44 I do test my plane.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 01:28:13 So far that checks out as a solid no.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 01:28:07 Currently I'm playing with the weight of blocks to see if I can't get my single engine biplane to fly.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 01:27:40 To see where weight needs redistribution.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 01:27:33 It'd be nice to see the scale against different sections of the plane as well.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 01:27:06 Center of mass doesn't really do that as accurately as I'd like *cough*
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 01:26:34 That might help with making planes fly.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 01:26:28 A weight/stress point indicator to see which part of the planes weigh what.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 01:26:11 you know what might be nice?
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 01:00:50 it just doesn't fly.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 01:00:45 my biplane is pretty now.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 01:00:40 Well
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 00:54:41 It's just the propeller is too weak.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 00:54:36 Which it should.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 00:52:57 I just want my plane to work.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 00:52:52 I don't want recognition for what I've done.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 00:25:54 Woah. way too spicy.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 00:25:32 But it's doable.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 00:25:24 The steering would be about nil... because trains don't steer.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 00:25:04 But they could still work as such.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 00:24:58 trains aren't meant for off-roading.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 00:24:46 They're quite great.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 00:24:43 Once you get trains set up though.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 00:24:29 Trains are actually quite nice. but they're insanely ineffective.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 00:23:58 Cars are the worst.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 00:23:55 Lets just agree.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 00:23:25 That debate was civil.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 00:22:57 Nice to meet you going to copy a build.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 00:22:32 Hi dad I'm golden ðŸ˜„
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 00:22:04 Yes, lets be civil here.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 00:21:15 You just weren't taught any manners so you can't tell the difference.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 00:21:05 No. It's pretty rude.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 00:20:45 That's awfully rude of you to assume.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 00:20:14 You said luxury plane.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 00:20:09 Not if it's a luxury plane that has no one else on board.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 00:19:55 Other side of the USA.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 00:19:50 I'll take my 5 hours thanks.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 00:19:38 being stuck on a large ship in the middle of the ocean with a bunch of random people.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 00:19:24 I'd rather have the plane ride for 5 hours
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 00:19:09 Build a boat with flappy wings.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 00:18:48 I'd be better off using tabletop simulator physics.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 00:18:40 That's because roblox physics are terrible.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 00:18:26 And I'll think about riding on it.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 00:18:13 build me a boat with flappy wings.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 00:18:01 boats don't do up very well.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 00:17:53 Most of that direction is up.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 00:17:36 Yes but a plane can go where boats can't.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 00:16:54 there's hardly any water for said boat.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 00:16:43 Yes, but I have no use for a boat.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 00:16:23 I did see a tank the other day though.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 00:16:07 not sure why I want to ride a boat in a plane building game.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 00:15:32 I told him I only ride planes.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 00:15:24 However... the first time I played someone asked me if I wanted to ride his boat.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 00:14:56 Because I can build whatever I want.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 00:14:39 to make it more obnoxious.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 00:14:19 then there's my block amount to consider.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 00:14:12 Buuut
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 00:14:08 Yea I'm agreeing with the motors.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 00:13:54 that ones a jigsaw puzzle.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 00:13:49 It's better than the one on the floor tho.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 00:13:42 laptop*
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 00:13:36 if this latop wasn't crap.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 00:13:32 I'd take one
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 00:13:20 that defeats the purpose again.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 00:12:42 I haven't had ballast blocks actually change anything.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 00:12:27 Which so far is working horribly.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 00:12:19 To have ONE engine.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 00:12:16 That's the entire point of this project.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 00:12:11 It's only supposed to have 1 engine...
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 00:11:55 yes, but adding random engines isn't what I'm trying to do.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 00:11:29 Pretty much.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 00:11:01 the standard propeller engine doesn't have enough oompf for flight.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 00:10:23 Speed is not the point here.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 00:10:11 Also biplanes aren't made for speed.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 00:10:03 It only ever made things worse.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 00:09:59 I tried helium
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 00:09:37 but it kinda glides mostly due to the weak engine.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 00:09:29 It actually flies somewhat fine if I drive it off a cliff.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 00:08:58 I don't want to do that.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 00:08:50 That would put me over 100 blocks ðŸ¤”
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 00:07:59 It's under 100 blocks.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 00:07:34 There's the winter propeller which is probably strong enough, but I can't get that.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 00:07:09 Biplanes don't have rocket engines.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 00:07:01 It's supposed to be an authentic biplane
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 00:06:55 I can't.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 00:06:48 I'm sure it is too.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 00:06:25 Like a wonky log.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 00:06:20 the heli flies awful too.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 00:06:11 Not right now some bean for brains is flying a heli into my plane.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 00:04:40 Propellor engine.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 00:04:29 I think the issue is a weak propellor tbh.,
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 00:04:21 well It's balanced out properly
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 00:04:01 I know how to build a plane.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 00:03:58 Yes I have actual wings.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 00:03:33 it just doesn't fly.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 00:03:30 and it DOES move.
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 00:03:26 I made a proper biplane this time
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 00:03:19 Not sure
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 00:03:12 Yea I did.
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 23:59:27 Hmm.. this plane just won't get off the ground.
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 23:28:45 but it would definitely impact flight.
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 23:28:40 I mean arguably it wouldn't change the mass.
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 23:26:59 Cause right now I'm having some issues with my center of mass.
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 23:26:23 it would really help me out.
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 23:26:19 I can't wait for that
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 23:25:27 I'm just saying it seems to have no impact on my center of mass at all.
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 23:24:35 This build doesn't have suspension.
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 23:24:29 I'm sure it would on that.
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 23:23:55 It doesn't do anything for me.
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 23:20:46 Is it me or does a ballast blocks density make 0 difference?
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 23:17:42 Bad. *squirtbottle*
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 23:17:27 No.
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 23:16:12 I'm working on projects that are 100 blocks or less
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 23:15:17 Spinny
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 23:12:12 No butter, no salt.
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 23:12:01 With onion.
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 23:11:57 I ate it.
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 19:04:52 So I only ever went backwards
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 19:04:31 I'm the idiot who forgot to invert a motor...
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 19:03:35 I keep doing the same thing expecting different results.
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 19:03:10 I'm insane.
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 19:03:05 It's official guys
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 04:59:02 No.
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 04:53:10 but it turns like a commercial airliner.
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 04:53:03 It keeps level fine
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 04:52:55 and it flies about as good as a penguin
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 04:52:40 Looks like a penguin
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 04:52:37 the best plane I've made so far
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 04:51:26 This should be fun.
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 04:51:24 Considering I'm really bad at making planes
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 04:51:18 Yea.
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 04:50:32 This is a under 100 block project.
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 04:49:51 No it was because of the gay handmade propellor being wonky af
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 04:49:16 I figured out why my plane was falling over.
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 04:49:07 Gop
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 04:48:18 Yus.
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 04:48:14 <:Beaned:519677444316463124> We have a beaned emoji?
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 04:32:50 and it still flops over.
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 04:32:45 I'm just adoring the fact I "balanced" the plane
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 03:18:54 because I'm smort.
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 03:18:51 the dumbass in me had a motor spinning the wrong way
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 03:18:12 I'm just an idiot. scuse me.
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 03:18:05 Wait now I know why.
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 03:17:39 :thonk:
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 03:17:35 I can't figure out why it goes backwards
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 03:16:08 I don't know ðŸ˜‚
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 03:15:37 An aviation vehicle.
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 03:15:16 Apparently I'm terrible at building planes.
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 03:15:08 Now it's going backwards ðŸ˜‚
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 02:59:10 It's not very smart of this biplane to not fly.
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 02:54:27 but I only used 62 blocks.
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 02:54:23 It doesn't fly
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 02:54:20 Wow
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 02:23:04 I'm redoing it.
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 02:22:54 hmm?
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 02:21:33 It's getting WINGS THAT WORK THAT'S THE HARD PART AAAAAA
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 02:21:17 The body is actually easy to make...
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 02:20:39 Nah I had to scrap it for rn. this model just ain't working.
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 02:19:59 I just need some help I can't get the balance quite right.
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 02:19:49 yea.
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 02:19:38 Yea it's under 100 blocks.
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 02:19:28 That's new model.
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 02:19:22 That's not a traditional biplane.
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 02:18:40 It doesn't look right.
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 02:18:37 help me with this dang biplane
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 02:18:31 Fungamer.
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 02:17:28 this just looks like 2 wings...
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 02:17:10 I want my biplane to actually LOOK like a biplane...
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 02:00:08 Biplane.
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 02:00:05 Not peter dummy.
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 01:55:20 there's almost no room for helium or weighty blocks.
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 01:55:09 Still having issues with getting it just right
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 01:55:02 Hmm..
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 01:50:44 Hmm...
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 01:46:37 Why helium.
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 01:46:30 In the front?
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 01:46:22 Please do.
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 01:46:08 I can't get mine to balance out properly.
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 01:45:52 They're just a pain to balance because they're horrible at flying.
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 01:45:44 No I mean like, on this game.
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 01:40:06 Biplanes are just bad.
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 01:39:57 you know.
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 00:26:03 I'm trying to build a biplane... with little to no success
plane-crazy 2019-07-13 23:46:40 Just a biplane man.
plane-crazy 2019-07-13 23:37:58 That's much more my skill level...
plane-crazy 2019-07-13 23:37:48 I'm making a biplane now.
plane-crazy 2019-07-13 23:15:37 my planes properly balanced now but it still doesn't fly right.
plane-crazy 2019-07-13 23:01:02 pf?
plane-crazy 2019-07-13 23:00:36 Anyone wanna see my penguin plane?
plane-crazy 2019-07-13 22:06:37 It's a 2 seater penguin plane
plane-crazy 2019-07-13 22:04:16 Anyone wanna see my penguin plane?
plane-crazy 2019-07-13 21:56:12 Only to have it look like a penguin.
plane-crazy 2019-07-13 21:56:05 I just spent several hours making a plane that was bird shaped
plane-crazy 2019-07-13 21:51:18 And I thank thee for correcting my thonks.
plane-crazy 2019-07-13 21:51:09 I thonk I didn't know that.
plane-crazy 2019-07-13 21:51:04 The thonk has been thonked.
plane-crazy 2019-07-13 21:50:44 <:Thonk:509498568982134816>
plane-crazy 2019-07-13 21:50:21 It meshes all the sides together into one weird congealed shape because of how Roblox does lighting.
plane-crazy 2019-07-13 21:49:52 Honestly hate building at night in this game.
plane-crazy 2019-07-13 21:34:18 It's literally a bunch of balls in a square tube.
plane-crazy 2019-07-13 21:34:09 What on earth is that guys plane
plane-crazy 2019-07-13 21:30:02 Thoughts?
plane-crazy 2019-07-13 21:29:59 I've gotta get the balance adjusted.
plane-crazy 2019-07-13 21:21:14 I'm almost done making just a random plane with a dumb design.
plane-crazy 2019-07-13 20:54:48 Now for an easy workaround.
plane-crazy 2019-07-13 20:54:43 In my plane
plane-crazy 2019-07-13 20:54:36 I have found a design flaw...
plane-crazy 2019-07-13 20:50:12 Which ironically... aren't floppy.
plane-crazy 2019-07-13 20:50:02 A FLOPPY DISK
plane-crazy 2019-07-13 20:49:58 The infamous floppy disk.
plane-crazy 2019-07-13 20:49:51 Ah yes. of course
plane-crazy 2019-07-13 20:49:19 Is there a way to save what I build?
plane-crazy 2019-07-13 20:31:10 So essentially... it does nothing I want it to. Nice.
plane-crazy 2019-07-13 20:29:34 Is it just a pipe dream
plane-crazy 2019-07-13 20:29:20 Does it create a central anchor for adjacent parts... or?
plane-crazy 2019-07-13 20:29:09 How does the anchor block work?
plane-crazy 2019-07-13 20:22:30 Such as the "disconnector"
plane-crazy 2019-07-13 20:22:24 Some of the parts confuse me on how they work too
plane-crazy 2019-07-13 20:19:43 I don't like it.
plane-crazy 2019-07-13 20:19:40 It's very clunky.
plane-crazy 2019-07-13 20:19:17 I'm not looking for something so clunky.
plane-crazy 2019-07-13 20:19:11 That's far too clunky.
plane-crazy 2019-07-13 20:17:11 That's totally not a chat flooding command.
plane-crazy 2019-07-13 20:17:03 I'm surprised there's not a bot channel for such commands
plane-crazy 2019-07-13 20:16:13 but to little to no success.
plane-crazy 2019-07-13 20:16:08 I was working on something interesting earlier...
plane-crazy 2019-07-13 20:16:00 Agreed.
plane-crazy 2019-07-13 20:14:59 It's just very impeding at times.
plane-crazy 2019-07-13 20:14:55 I'm not saying it's bad
plane-crazy 2019-07-13 20:14:19 And the snap is just gross.
plane-crazy 2019-07-13 20:14:13 the shapes are just odd...
plane-crazy 2019-07-13 20:12:00 but the snap points are disgusting.
plane-crazy 2019-07-13 20:11:54 I tried making something cool earlier
plane-crazy 2019-07-13 20:08:53 Why does nobody I see actually build a plane.
plane-crazy 2019-07-13 20:08:47 This is a plane building game.
