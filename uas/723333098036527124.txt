creations-chat 2020-11-10 02:21:43 I also thinks it's to big, and blocky
creations-chat 2020-11-10 02:26:20 that looks cool
help 2020-11-10 02:49:27 how to I upload a video to the creations chat without having to view with download
help 2020-11-10 02:56:24 ok thanks
help 2020-11-10 02:59:15 what do you mean
creations-chat 2020-11-10 03:02:30 <@!469867183816572930> How did you make that, it looks cool
help 2020-11-10 03:03:26 I got the video, how to I send it as a file
help 2020-11-11 02:19:53 anyone know how to increase grip on custom tires (cylinders)
help 2020-11-11 02:21:10 <@!325875263336349696> you could add shock absorbers or make less contact with the terrain
help 2020-11-11 02:52:21 what's that?
help 2020-11-11 02:52:42 yea I tried that, but it just makes it bumpy as hell
help 2020-11-11 02:53:26 when I accellarate the susspension just goes crazy, and it doesn't seem to increase any grip

help 2020-11-11 20:18:23 anyoen know how to make tank treads on custom wheels
help 2020-11-11 20:20:38 
help 2020-11-11 20:20:47 with adjusted heights
creations-chat 2020-11-11 20:29:25 Is this good or do I need treads?
creations-chat 2020-11-11 20:38:15 also I'm being told that ropes will make the tank become unstable. I'm using them to adjust the height of each of the wheels. Anyone know a better way to adjust the height
creations-chat 2020-11-11 20:41:57 the height adjustment is pretty much for being better with terrain
creations-chat 2020-11-11 20:50:13 > true but you can just make the suspension higher without moving the suspension with ropes
<@!466458334728421386> thanks didn't think of that
creations-chat 2020-11-11 22:35:27 wow that's a 6 pison
creations-chat 2020-11-11 22:37:03 I bet you don't even know what those pipes do
creations-chat 2020-11-11 22:39:14 that's good to know, Just making sure, yes it's the exhaust. either that or were the fuel injector, or carburetor goes
creations-chat 2020-11-11 22:41:54 My knowledge of engines comes from taking small gas engines class, and a game called my summer car. lol
creations-chat 2020-11-11 22:44:57 In an internal combustable engine. The flywheel turns which triggers the armature coil, sending a spark to the sparkplug igniting the air/fuel mixture forcing the pison to go down, then the exhaust valve opens which sucks up all the smoke and stuff, which goes out of your exhaust. Sorry to change the subject but that's my knowledge
creations-chat 2020-11-11 22:47:54 yes my poor word choice
creations-chat 2020-11-11 22:49:55 oh I just thought of it as intake power compression exhaust
creations-chat 2020-11-11 22:52:08 guys wanna know the ironic thing about electric cars. - The batteries contain lithium which needs to be mined. All of that mining emits carbon. (or at least I think it's carbon) That's twice as much emittions from your internal combustion engine or gasoline car. PRETTY IRONIC HEY.
help 2020-11-12 01:39:07 should I have my tank's turret controlled with a motor(using keys to turn) or motor 2(using mouse to turn). Same question with the barrel. I'm having difficulties with moving the turret with my mouse. Sometimes it will turn, but sometimes it wont.
help 2020-11-12 01:45:52 yea that's what I'm thinking
help 2020-11-12 03:05:38 so for streamable to upload a video, do I just copy and paste the link?
help 2020-11-12 03:07:37 Oh I was going to paste it in creations
help 2020-11-12 03:08:00 could I post it there?
help 2020-11-12 03:08:32 k
creations-chat 2020-11-12 03:19:43 <@456226577798135808> Nice differential, It reminds me of one of an old video on youtube explaining how one works.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYAw79386WI - 5:37
creations-chat 2020-11-12 03:22:41 now that I think of it, I think he copied...not sure
creations-chat 2020-11-12 22:24:27 I need answers
creations-chat 2020-11-12 22:26:17 understand what better?
creations-chat 2020-11-12 22:28:34 oh, yea I whatched a ton of those videos, they are very interesting. There are all kind of them, like susspension, differential, transmission, braking
creations-chat 2020-11-12 22:38:32 lol is that the confederate flag?
help 2020-11-13 00:45:54 for some reason I can't post stuff in creations
help 2020-11-13 00:47:31 I posted a link for my video, but I also put in text
creations-chat 2020-11-13 00:48:12 so how much of an engine are you making? that would be impressive if you get the whole thing
help 2020-11-13 00:49:16 I used streamable
creations-chat 2020-11-13 00:50:32 wow, flywheen might not fit by looking at the size of the engine
creations-chat 2020-11-13 00:53:02 that seems extreme, I was thinking more like this
help 2020-11-13 00:55:00 ok I got the link to post, but now there is no up or downvote
creations-chat 2020-11-13 00:57:09 VmP I bet you can't get the rocker cover, and rockershaft on. - Wait what type of valves does it have? - I'm sick of this slowmow chat thing :/
creations-chat 2020-11-13 01:01:18 Yea my summer car, that's what I was referencing to. I wanna see you pull off a fanbelt on that
creations-chat 2020-11-13 01:03:19 are you making a carburetor or a fuel injector - Honnestly vmp where you're at, I would have given up, I can't make any mechanical thing because there are no gears, bearings, bores, chains : (
creations-chat 2020-11-13 01:10:24 for some reason my post doesn't have an up or downvote
creations-chat 2020-11-13 01:14:08 no the other one, I just posted it like 20 minutes ago
creations-chat 2020-11-13 01:15:47 ...the third one up from the bottom

creations-chat 2020-11-13 01:19:47 wth, it kept making the link dissapear when I pressed enter, and I finnaly got it to work...how in the world do I share a video. I copied and pasted the link from streamable :/<:what:644996672048463942>
creations-chat 2020-11-13 01:21:47 ok look now, by the way, the motors are turning with my bare hands - man power
creations-chat 2020-11-13 01:33:49 anyone know how I could put treads on this bad boy
creations-chat 2020-11-13 01:35:27 I tested the susspension and it can barely make the train tracks, Doesn't seem very transitional
creations-chat 2020-11-13 01:39:28 HoF?, dude how many hours did that take you, looks amazing
creations-chat 2020-11-13 01:45:05 I tried to make a very small engine, (Not realistic) and I gave up trying to time the valves
creations-chat 2020-11-13 01:46:37 I wish you could rotate objects more specific than just 90 degrees.
creations-chat 2020-11-13 01:51:06 yea, but how would you do that when you're in the middle of building. I want something to just be built diagonal
creations-chat 2020-11-13 15:54:54 https://streamable.com/g28ico Can someone help me get my engine to not flaw
creations-chat 2020-11-13 15:59:03 i tried to make a single cylinder, but seems to easy, the valves are my problem, and piston keeps sticking. The 3 circles in the back are there so I can eventually connect the valves, but If it keeps getting stuck it's no use.
creations-chat 2020-11-13 16:00:49 that looks cool

help 2020-11-13 22:36:38 Anyone know how to make a spring mechanism for a gun magazine? I tried suspension but it just glitches the suspension up, and goes through the projectiles. I tried conveyors, but they fling the projectiles.
help 2021-02-24 20:41:43 can I post a video of my creation
help 2021-02-24 20:41:49 for some reason I only can do an image
help 2021-02-24 20:42:34 yes
help 2021-02-24 20:44:59 I'll just put a picture instead
creations-chat 2021-02-24 20:46:23 thanks
creations-chat 2021-02-24 20:48:28 am I allowed to post a streamable link here? I have a video but I couldn't post it in creations
help 2021-02-24 20:50:06 what do you mean?
help 2021-02-24 20:55:58 anyone know how I can make a motor system where I can slowly accelarate or decelarate other than just all power or no power
help 2021-02-24 20:57:49 I tried using a gear system with a rocket for better torque but there's not enough grip
help 2021-02-24 20:58:50 ..In an engine you want less friction, why use fabric?
help 2021-02-24 21:00:14 can you show me your build so I can see what you're talking about
help 2021-02-24 21:01:32 I thought you said fabric cylinders
help 2021-02-24 21:01:43 alright that makes more sense
help 2021-02-24 21:01:46 thanks
help 2021-02-24 21:02:44 oh
help 2021-02-24 21:05:28 oh now that makes more sense, I never made a chain before
help 2021-02-24 21:06:58 rip
help 2021-02-24 21:07:33 usually on a chain you would have a gear, and the chain part would interlock the with teeth of the gear, but the way this game works you have to do some pretty unrealistic things
help 2021-02-24 21:09:04 yea, I tried making a v2 engine, you can't rotate anything on a 45 degree angle so....
help 2021-02-24 21:13:16 yea the way how I made mine, I just made a horizontal engine, then used servo motors to turn it into a v shape
help 2021-02-24 21:16:41 lol
