bug-reports 2021-06-18 22:45:04 Ok so I recently noticed that every time in in pvp and my build gets destroyed, no mater what the size my game freezes up and it stays frozen for ever. I play on an iPad too. I’m not sure if anyone else noticed this but it’s kinda getting annoying
bug-reports 2021-06-18 22:49:10 I recently built a LAV-25 and it’s every time I get destroyed my game freezes up
bug-reports 2021-06-18 22:49:19 It’s mainly affecting that
bug-reports 2021-06-18 22:49:28 It’s 487 blocks
bug-reports 2021-06-19 01:56:17 I found out the issue with my build, it’s the piston lock, I freeze when I die because of piston lock, please if ur able to fix the bug

bug-reports 2021-09-30 14:25:29 Is anyone else seeing this?
help 2021-10-04 14:16:14 That happens because your wheels stop instantly and the momentum still continues and causes ur tires to bounce, I would suggest a very tight suspension to fix it or change tire materials
help 2021-10-04 14:16:42 Is there any way I can fill that small gap
help 2021-10-04 14:16:46 I fold it like this

bug-reports 2022-04-17 18:23:50 I don’t know if this is something with me or the game but I’m getting this message now every so often but it never did this before.
bug-reports 2022-04-17 18:25:21 I play on a 6th gen iPad 32GB
bug-reports 2022-04-17 19:42:12 I know but it never said that before
bug-reports 2022-04-17 19:42:20 Only recently like the past 2 days
bug-reports 2022-04-22 10:13:23 My issue is whatever this is, using tnt to make a smooth barrel for a tank, each side is the exact same but gives me different results and when I changed the blast radius to maybe see if that would do anything it just destroys them.

bug-reports 2022-04-22 10:14:22 If anyone can help, it would be appreciated
bug-reports 2022-04-22 10:17:59 I’m not sure if it is a bug or anything but it never did it before when I started working on it like 3 month ago. It was only until recently when this started happening
bug-reports 2022-04-25 17:19:06 I have no clue but I’m not complaining
