Target blocks
Configurable 

What about a block that can be paired with another block of its kind, then when a button is pressed, they will go together no matter how far away they are, like a really long, invisible rope block reeling In. This would be the target block, an example how how it could be used is in a space x rocket replica, one target block would be in the bottom of the booster, the other would be where is would land, when the booster separates, the target blocks activate, bringing the 2 target blocks together and therefore bringing thr booster to the landing pad so it looks like its landing. These could be paired by setting the activate /deactivate button on 2 of them to the same button, example would be R, then in the rocket example, when the booster drops, R would be pressed by the player. That would activate the 2 target blocks and make the booster land, they could be like a magnet but only takes up 1 block of space in the hitbox instead of 2, and with like a wifi symbol on the sides. This block could also be useful in say, a space station build, to Dock 2 parts of a space station high above the map, this could be tested in the plane crazy 1 testing server, and if it works, then could be fully added sometime in PC2's release, I apologise if this is a very long suggestion but I feel this feature would be beneficial to many players in the future, thank you for your time.
