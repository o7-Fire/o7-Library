creations-chat 2021-12-22 05:17:07 I don't even build jets, and that nose is freaking me out... along with the random disconnected blocks lying around. What's gong on with that?
I'm guessing the weird coloring is so it's easier to make edits without all the white blending together and that's not the intended final camo?
creations-chat 2021-12-22 08:23:58 Alright, I'll bite for some actual constructive criticism. What exactly is the issue the majority seems to have with my Light Cruiser in creations?
I know the metaphorical judge panel here can be both fickle and a bit brutal, but as long as it's not a petty gripe about coloration or screenshot quality, I'd like to hear it.

And to pre-empt one possibility in particular; yes, I know the nose is sharp enough to take out an eye. If there's anywhere I struggle, it's making a more realistic-looking front half of the ship. XD

Also, this is also quite specifically not a low effort build in case any had that impression. I've spent a fair amount of time on it, since I didn't use a tutorial (aside from the AA guns) and had to invent a new main gun model specifically for it.

Also, the superstructure is specifically meant to be sort of boxy, since I based it off old early cruisers.
creations-chat 2021-12-22 08:50:25 ObcProChan: 
It actually has no unifying national theme, and your blueprint is way too early for what I'm aiming for, along with having basically no superstructure at all. It is an original after all, and it's specifically meant to be old... but not 1910 level old.
Also USS Texas is a horrible example to use; it's a battleship and totally different.

AWACSweepin:
Sorry, I mistyped. It's honestly based more on a german DD superstructure than anything else.
The canons actually physically couldn't get any slimmer without sacrificing the ability to aim up and down; the top and sides are even half blocks..
AA looked ugly any other way. Originally, I wanted to use single guns spread out, but the AA fire wasn't concentrated enough to do anything to planes. I wanted to have actually functional turrets.
I'm fine with harsh criticism, as long as it's actually legit and not base insults.

Masterr_Oogway: 
Snow pipe smoke is ugly as sin. I wanted real smoke, not that cheap stuff that makes a hole in reality when colored black/grey.
Turrets literally couldn't get slimmer without sacrificing functionality.

MyMainGotBanSlapped:
Actual feedback thanks, not banal insults.

the_mechanic2001: 
Wow, nice, actual feedback.
Only problem here is that my build is only called a USS out of convenience, because the roblox filter was messing with my signs. It is not in any way based on any american ship, but german DD/Cruisers instead.

N00bmaster212:
Yeah, I thought it was bit large myself, but I couldn't get it smaller without making the innards unreasonably cramped and undetailed.
And thanks, I am ignoring the random insults with no explanation. I knew I was gonna get ass-blasted coming in here. XD
creations-chat 2021-12-22 08:52:48 Saves time. No other explanation really.
creations-chat 2021-12-22 09:01:52 <@!757887014388367401> 
Yeah, honestly, my ships are more german themed than anything, but Prinz Eugen is also a bit TOO modern for what I'm making. I'd have to say mine is more of a WW1 age ship in intended appearance. After all, it's meant to be a first-gen cruiser.

(currently searching the World of Warships wiki to find which ships I built off the concepts of)
creations-chat 2021-12-22 09:04:57 <@!715148402022678608> 
I mentioned in the original post, but the ship had to be downsized to ensure it was actually cruiser sized compared to my battlecruiser. Therefore, indeed, deck space became an unfortunate limitation. I really would have liked to add some torpedo tubes.
creations-chat 2021-12-22 09:20:10 Thanks. I will definitely give these a look, but like I said, this ship is not intended to actually look like it comes from any specific nation, rather a new nation instead perhaps.
It's intended to be a late WW1/early WWII cruiser of indeterminate nationality, but I did take inspiration primarily from german ships for it.

The weirdness of the superstructure is because it's sort of half-way between german cruiser, Nurnberg, and german DD , T-22. Meanwhile, the turret layout is based more on the Hipper class quad set (all pictures are in order of mentioning). Which, like I said, I merely took inspiration from. In function, the ship is intended to be a light cruiser, but it's a hybrid through and through.
creations-chat 2021-12-22 09:22:12 No, I don't think I will. I'm actually getting good advice out of this.
creations-chat 2021-12-22 09:25:34 Only if you're incredibly petty. This is actual constructive conversation taking place. It's not my fault if you don't like scrolling. Not like I'm @-ing you outside of when you mention me.
creations-chat 2021-12-22 09:45:24 Seems large enough to me, but it really depends on what's trying to land.
That said, the vast majority of jets and such should have no issues.
creations-chat 2021-12-22 09:53:33 The reason I say that most jets should have no trouble is that most jets are small-ish for pvp efficiency and use a ridiculous amount of motor lock to get that way.

The jet above me, for example, looks like a good fit if the rockets are any good indication of scale. Honestly, your deck is big enough. The biggest limiter is the skill of a plane's pilot at landing
creations-chat 2021-12-22 09:55:56 That's a cute false accusation you've got there. The original is still live (and still getting ratioed into oblivion at that). I've deleted nothing.
creations-chat 2021-12-22 10:00:41 Not gonna argue that! I'll definitely be doing some retrofitting. 

I can't do anything about the size of the main guns (they literally cannot get slimmer without sacrificing function), but the most consistent complaint that I might be able to work is getting the superstructure to approach something more palatable.
Also have to see if I can do anything about the AA.
creations-chat 2021-12-22 12:42:04 Something's not quite right here, but I just can't put my nose on it...

I kid, but jokes aside, that nose needs some work. I'm not even a jet builder, but that sticks out to me blatantly. Not sure what's going on there.
creations-chat 2021-12-22 12:45:01 Well, I don't build jets, so you're clearly the expert here between us I suppose. That just doesn't look like a very aerodynamic nose that any sane designer would put on the final blueprint.

creations-chat 2021-12-22 12:47:25 Hallelujah! Sanity has been restored!
creations-chat 2021-12-22 16:06:02 Righto, having digested and applied some feedback, the following changes have been introduced to my light cruiser:
-1): Name change to TSS (Texas State Ship) Rio Grand to reduce confusion/expectations.
-2): A proper paint job, done to the tune of German 51/50.
-3): Superstructure expansion around turrets so it looks less like a freaking box & shortening of the entire superstructure height by 2 blocks.
-4): Main guns have miraculously somehow been made even slimmer and more compact by half a block without effecting functionality, and the barrels have been extended by a block & a half to stop them looking as stubby. (currently trying to get them half a block shorter, but the chances aren't good of that happening)
-5): AA guns were oversized/ugly and thus reduced to single gun mounts, pending possible replacement. (I am very much widely open to any good low-space AA guns that can be recommended)

Feedback? (aside from the smokestack being oversized right now; it's on my list of future fixes)
creations-chat 2021-12-22 16:10:26 Lmao. I'm looking for actual feedback, not elitism, thanks. I'll keep doing what I do in the meantime.
creations-chat 2021-12-22 16:28:07 The flag is actually on the front and going nowhere.
The length is deliberate, so that it is a light cruiser compared to my battlecruiser. Maybe the screenshot angle is too bad to tell, but it's not fat. Actually, it's probably too thin.
The cannons literally cannot get slimmer while retaining functionality. Each turret is 3 blocks  wide with half-block armor.
The ladder/railings aren't really possible to smooth out, since I can't place them at anything but a right angle (unless I have somehow missed such a feature).
Battleship smoke is thick and dark, and mine is honestly too light if anything.
Good idea with the windows. I can already think of a fix for that.

What would you recommend for thinner barrels? I'm using the smallest cylinders right now, but one of the half blocks might work?
creations-chat 2021-12-22 16:33:41 Wouldn't stacked sparklers look odd? My barrels would look very short and squat if I only used one for each barrel though. Unless you're saying that it would be worth it appearance-wise, even with the awkward sparkler bases sticking out along the barrels?
creations-chat 2021-12-22 16:40:43 More transparent smoke? Eh, maybe it is a little too thick, but I'm planning to make the smoke stack smaller with fewer smoke pipes, so it shouldn't be as obnoxious.
I can't see how motor locks wouldn't make things worse. One of the biggest criticisms of builds that I see is "exposed motor lock". I can think of a couple ways it could maybe work, but it seems more trouble than it's worth.
The flag is on a powerless motor so that it swings about. I suppose I could turn on "reset", and that might help.

I think I see what you're saying with the disconnector heads. I'll give it a look, but my barrels are 2-3 long, so that limits my options to preserve looks.
And yes, the barrels are 1x1 cylinders, and it's an issue for exactly the reason you said.
creations-chat 2021-12-22 17:03:20 Hmm, fair enough. I was already convinced to lighten it up some, but...
I use smoke pipes currently.
Are snow pipes better? In my experience, they give very flat, unnatural looking smoke. Is there a color code that strikes the right balance?
creations-chat 2021-12-22 17:05:21 Honestly, I've tried that before, and it looked even more awful than using either alone.
creations-chat 2021-12-25 22:56:13 <@!720379170986786946> Bruh, you can post all the images at once in a single post. And at least one of the last two is redundant and should be deleted.
creations-chat 2021-12-25 22:58:54 Is this meant to be a specific plane or a custom?
creations-chat 2021-12-25 23:02:40 Unfortunately, voters on here tend to care more about the looks and how elaborate it is, rather than the functionality.
If I had to say anything that stood out to me, it would be that you might want to give it a new paint-job? Beyond that, I tend to think as you do and favor function over form... mostly.
I'm not an expert on planes, so I can't really say what would make it better other than speed, assuming you're not already using hover-drives.

Edit: Also, yes, better screenshot angles would help your score and help people figure out how to help. Specifically, closer up screen-shots from multiple angles and maybe one of the side of the plane in build mode.
creations-chat 2021-12-25 23:05:48 HOLY SUPERSTRUCTURE!

And definitely gonna second the post above me regarding the plane. I can't really put my finger on it, but just something about the plane's shape is niggling at me (cause, you know, not a plane expert).
creations-chat 2021-12-25 23:08:25 As for the ship, what are you trying to build specifically?
It sort of looks vaguely like a modern destroyer? (VERY vaguely)

Almost looks like you started out trying to build a WW1-WW2 cruiser/battleship and then changed your mind after getting halfway and finishing the hull.
The main thing is that it's either sitting REALLY low in the water, or that superstructure is even bigger comparatively than I was imagining.
creations-chat 2021-12-25 23:24:45 Okay, correct me if I'm wrong, but that's mostly a custom warship as well, made for pvp? If that's the case the main thing I'd say needs improving is the weaponry. I don't see any main guns aside from the one, which I can only guess is filled with gun blocks.

5 Things:
-First, split your gun blocks up into 2 different places at least, so you don't lose all of them at once from a lucky shot.
-Second, use 1x7 beams whenever feasible. They resist rockets, so they're extremely practical for pvp.
-Third, add some rockets of your own, either in main gun mounts or rocket launcher mounts. Whatever you do, just make sure you have them.
-Fourth, unless you're REALLY attached to the shape of that superstructure or absolutely require it to hold helium blocks or something, try and shave off as much as possible to give yourself more deck space and reduce weight and targeting surface. Right now, it would be difficult for tracking rockets to actually MISS you.
-5th, if you haven't done it already, replace your propulsion with hover-drives for speed and super rockets for turning. It's way more efficient on a space/weight-to-power scale. You will guaranteed get more bang for your buck. Just make sure to use ballast beams along the keel to stay balanced. The sheer speed of hover drives tends to make turning difficult if you throttle them to full blast.
creations-chat 2021-12-25 23:38:09 Absolutely can see the improvement. The proportions definitely don't seem as awkward, but yeah, that wing shape...
Though, I do understand you're mainly going for a practical custom pvp aircraft and not a depiction of anything in particular.
creations-chat 2021-12-25 23:41:04 This is true, especially given that it's a custom aircraft.
help 2022-03-01 21:46:31 Could have sworn I heard something somewhere about it, but I can't find it now. Anyone know if gold blocks have any particular use? Do they resist guns or something, or are they just a full on April fool's troll/flex brick?
creations-chat 2022-03-01 21:47:44 How descriptive and helpful. (lul)
creations-chat 2022-03-01 21:59:03 Not your fault (mostly) I'd say. Criticism and quality standards are just... *incredibly* harsh in this community. Typically, they care more about looks over function when it comes to Creations.

I'm a boat main, so I can't provide any advice on how to improve on things beyond saying you just need to find a way to slim down those rotors to look like actual blades. Honestly, I'll upvote just for the fact that you can build a working helicopter at all (where I can't), and the fact that it doesn't look all that bad if you aren't using real high standards.

I'd say pop over to <#478584971670454284> if you want to get some actual advice on how to potentially smooth things over (ie bricks/techniques to use).
creations-chat 2022-03-01 22:06:59 Such deep and insightful advice, lol.
help 2022-03-01 22:11:46 Hmm... That's all? Ah well.
help 2022-03-01 23:30:31 Yeah, this isn't even hard tbh, and I'm trash at ground vehicles.
either use motor 2s so they follow your mouse, or use a third method of propulsion to provide another vector for turning (another wheel or something).
help 2022-03-01 23:39:07 OH WAIT! I get it I think. There should be a "reset" function in the normal motors. Make sure you have that on, and it should return the wheels to their original position whenever you aren't currently pressing the key.
help 2022-03-01 23:39:44 No prob.

creations-chat 2022-03-02 21:04:16 <@!431881268775616513> 
Bunch of blocks/motor lock(?) free floating in the back, but otherwise decent-ish.
Honestly, if this were simply a larger built that could hide/contain that, it would have little to criticize from me. It would also mean more room for a smoother shape/detailing to everything. If the shape of the front bits is any clue, there's clearly some motor lock shenanigans going on.
creations-chat 2022-03-02 21:09:25 I could sorta tell (granted, I'm one to talk, lol). Those front bits are shaped more like screwdrivers than sleek cones. As far as improvements though, number one has got to be finding a better spot for those control surfaces. Visually, that bit is gonna get judged the hardest, since it's so noticeable.
creations-chat 2022-03-02 21:14:42 If you want the front bits to look smoother, I'd highly recommend using corner/triangle wedges if possible. I think that would smooth things out into a rounder shape.
Maybe rounded wedge out parts could help too, depending.
creations-chat 2022-03-02 21:28:38 Well... you can tell that it's an X-wing specifically, so I'll give you props for that much.
In terms of improvements/actual constructive criticism, I'd first say to use some trail parts to form the gun barrels on each wing.
Secondly, it's not supposed to have any sort of visible tailfin/delta wing at all.
Thirdly, the four engines should really be round, not cubical.
creations-chat 2022-03-02 21:36:04 Honestly, I'm just giving you the very basics that I can see. I'm no expert at planes (I basically do boats exclusively, lol), so those improvements won't likely sway the majority of votes overmuch. Your biggest problem here is probably the relatively small size of the build, which prevents you from having much detail without some serious motor lock shenanigans.
creations-chat 2022-03-02 21:49:07 Yeah, but he seems pretty new, so I'm not sure he even knows *how* to motor lock, never mind performing a complicated enough one to pack sufficient detail into a build that size.
help 2022-03-02 22:10:02 If you want it to look smoother, try motor lock maybe? That should close the distance.
Unless that would screw things up during spawn (since I see some obstructions there).
help 2022-03-02 22:11:11 No problem.

help 2022-03-04 23:12:14 I mean in terms of customizing for higher level, convenient builds. I like to set all of mine to useless keys and also have them transparent. Saves time and lag.
help 2022-03-04 23:23:01 I mean, I still do that anyway, but I also change the keys too, since I like using the L key for the actually desired lights on my builds, but this isn't about me needing aid. I was helping someone else, not asking for advice. Thanks though, as I did forget to mention that.

Only finished builds are allowed in <#384025409945337856>. Place unfinished ones here or in <#478584971670454284> if you're looking for actually constructive advice on fixing something.
help 2022-03-04 23:32:02 I'd say number one is to look into making some smoother treads/tracks. Unfortunately, I'm garbage at ground vehicles, much less tanks (I basically only make aquatic stuff), so I can't offer specific advice on how to do that.
help 2022-03-04 23:33:44 Might be referring to the exposed motor-lock. That's a big no-no in terms of what will loose you upvotes.
help 2022-03-04 23:37:57 It's cool. No one is starting out.
Honestly, before the turret barrel, I'd say the massive gaps in the treads/tracks are the primary issue. The barrel ain't perfect, but it's tolerable somewhat. The treads, however, are just really in your face though.
help 2022-03-04 23:43:38 For one, maybe making it so the motor lock is closer to the base of the gun barrel if at all possible. That way the bulge of motor lock isn't as egregious. That won't hide the lock, but it will make the barrel look smoother overall.

I'm assuming you're trying to go for a balance between showcase-worthy and actual pvp practicality, so that's the only reason I don't suggest just putting the whole apparatus inside the body of the turret itself or doing away with it entirely. As things are, however, a single cylinder block space is simply not enough to properly conceal a motor lock.

help 2022-03-05 00:12:42 Epic. I've been meaning to start branching out from warships into spaceships. I crave hyper drive shenanigans.
creations-chat 2022-03-05 00:29:31 For a start, what is this even supposed to be? Is it original or based on something?
creations-chat 2022-03-05 00:34:35 Well, that both simplifies things and makes them more complicated. I can hardly help if it's not based on anything. The fact that it's original means every bit of advice regarding it is likely to be purely subjective.
And what even exactly is it? A tank or something?
creations-chat 2022-03-05 00:36:47 Ah, well, just gonna put it out there, but that turret shape is incredibly cursed overall. Unless you're going for something sci-fi-ish, there's pretty much no sane person that would make it that shape irl.
creations-chat 2022-03-05 00:45:11 Some closer up pictures would do instead, yeah? Especially regarding the mouth and eyebrows. The resolution is perhaps just really bad with all these far away shots.
creations-chat 2022-03-05 00:47:52 Nicely spotted. The player has a shadow, but not the build.
Guess it really is a complete fake.
creations-chat 2022-03-05 00:50:06 Yeh.
creations-chat 2022-03-05 01:09:15 Lmao, he actually left the server entirely.
creations-chat 2022-03-05 01:30:25 Objectively? The first one is better, not perfect, but way better. The second is a sci-fi-wannabe abomination, and despite it clearly being made solely for pvp, it looks like it's not all that good at it with all the firepower concentrated forward and the bombs able to be knocked out by something as simple as rough terrain with an open top like that.
creations-chat 2022-03-05 01:42:43 Both hurt my soul equally in different ways. You clearly like your... sci-fi(?), but bruh, you ain't gonna find any help in here with this kind of base quality.
<#504436696021204992> response summarized?: Scrap it and rebuild (as the utterly brutal ratio in <#384025409945337856>  can attest to.
Try taking this to <#478584971670454284> and only if you're actually looking for improvements to make. If you're just here looking for people to be impressed by your builds, I can (un?)fortunately assure you they will be in the vast minority.
creations-chat 2022-03-05 01:51:10 That guy actually left the server outright, and he hasn't come back. XD
help 2022-03-05 05:02:22 If you want on-board anti-plane weaponry, try incorporating multiple cameras/camera mounts linked to high-speed motor 2s. That way the AA guns can simply follow your mouse to aim at planes. Speaking as someone who makes warships pretty much exclusively, this is typically the most reliable AA against extreme speed builds (at least for WW1-2 type warships).

As far as the missile, maybe the camera aiming method could help, like having some mounted on either the front or the back of it. For a missile to reliably hit something like a jet, using default flight controls might be best. The main limitation on the missile is going to be visibility from the missile's perspective, since it will need to chase down the target with great accuracy.

Use either a hover drive or super rockets for propulsion. The former is stronger but may require some motor lock shenanigans to reach its full potential. If by some miracle, you can fit a conveyor drive inside the missile, that could be even better in terms of max speed, but the trade-off will be flexibility. In terms of all-around application, the hover drive is best, even if it requires motor lock.
help 2022-03-05 05:40:19 Ah, in that case, maybe switch the missile to detonate on button press, but also have it so it's unarmed until the button press. Or maybe I'm not thinking about it right, but I've had more issues with "on contact" payloads detonating early from their own speed than anything else. Having it so you can manually detonate once close enough tends to solve the problem.

In terms of actual payload, just maximize the detonation force and range on explosive blocks. That tends to maximize their potential, and they will tear through triple layered armor like it's hot butter. If you need help with initial penetration, maybe add some guns to the front of the missile and burrow into the target some right before detonating.
help 2022-03-05 07:18:23 Yus, lol.
Ever since I had a pvp server with a singlar space ship basically terrorizing the whole place and uniting everyone against him (to little effect), I have hoped to one day emulate such absurdity. His main strength was that he would hyper drive to the opposite end of the map whenever anyone got close and just rain fire from his guns and rockets.
After witnessing such absurd power, how could I not crave it. XD
creations-chat 2022-03-05 07:21:18 Bot broke, lol. Chaos ensued.
help 2022-03-05 08:30:04 Yeah, I've started using tnt+1x7 armor for my warship armor belts. It's very effective, even if the weight is a bit... noticable.
help 2022-03-05 08:53:02 Ice is lightwieght? I haven't experimented with materials much other than being annoyed with how heavy metal and diamond plate are. Though I do make my ship decks out of wood planks. Is ice material less durable or anything? I'll tolerate the weight if it would compromise the armor effectiveness. My ship's such a huge target that it's difficult to miss without truly horrible aim or very clunky/ineffective weapons, and a little extra speed won't change much.
help 2022-03-05 09:03:58 Mmm, I see, I see. Good to know. I have been lacking in this area of my knowledge base and resorted to truly egregious amounts of helium blocks in my poor superstructure. This has resulted in some fairly hilarious ship deaths, to be honest, but I will definitely implement ice armor soon now. My folds have been getting clunky from the weight of a detailed build.
help 2022-03-05 09:10:19 I use double folds on my large warships, typically with one hidden well below the water line for each fold. It is incredibly rare and unlucky for both motors of a fold to be destroyed, kinda like taking a citadel hit. And honestly, if they've done enough damage to sever both, then I'm pretty screwed anyway. XD
bug-reports 2022-03-06 02:40:23 Did your boat have folds? That sort of thing tends to happen if my motors have a massive freak out. Lmao, usually I shoot into infinity so hard and fast that I die within moments and reset.
