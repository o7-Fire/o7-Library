creations-chat 2020-10-20 17:54:26 piston chambering submachine gun, it actually worked.
creations-chat 2020-10-20 17:56:11 
creations-chat 2020-10-20 17:58:08 it fires like 7 explosive balls, the mag works with a magnet and then once chambered, the piston pushes it into range of another magnet that accelerates it
creations-chat 2020-10-20 18:00:15 that moment when you take a part of a combustion engine and use it as a bullet chambering mechanism, stock pistons are overrated
creations-chat 2020-10-20 18:26:53 if I lose 126 ranks I will literally die and quit phantom forces

creations-chat 2020-10-23 23:15:06 looks good, TIE fighter could use with detailing
creations-chat 2020-10-23 23:18:06 what confuses me is that people post in <#384025409945337856> to get feedback

creations-chat 2021-03-20 05:40:17 I was working on one, I have the magazine done which is arguably the hardest part cause of the weird shape
creations-chat 2021-03-20 05:42:19 I thought about using the disconnectors but I couldnt get the shape I wanted with them, and also im using "caseless" ammunition so I cant really pull back the top much farther without having an uncontrollable burst
creations-chat 2021-03-20 05:45:38 I have thought about using springs and arguably it will make jamming a lot less common but the major problem is that its not compact
