creations-chat 2022-11-02 23:05:33 I mean hes probably a clowm
creations-chat 2022-11-03 12:42:01 Same thing to su 57 when I see them dogfight in tp 2 I was like "Dawg how tf did a F 14A DO THAT SHIT WITHOUT A PROBLEM?" and su 57 is highly agile so I doubt it would be beatable
creations-chat 2022-11-03 12:48:16 So? Who would say an f 22 can beat a f35 when f 22 has 2D THRUST VECTORING and is built for agility against a f 35 which it sint built for dogfighting and its literally the opposite of what your saying it should be F 35 Need to turn to shoot since it lack agility even compare to an f 16 which is quite agile
creations-chat 2022-11-03 12:59:11 Oh yea I thought that I'm gonna loose on a argument when his argument is about f 22 and f 35 dogfighting and how f 35 "can" defeat f 22 but his argument is basically about how f 35 can win in bvr engagement NOT in dogfighting
creations-chat 2022-11-03 13:01:59 I mean at this point are you talking about how f 35 can win in a bvr engagement or dogfighting?
creations-chat 2022-11-03 13:04:46 Also ignoring that not all missile dumb and can be smart cna track it

<@778018583686021180> agile than the f 22? Nah
creations-chat 2022-11-03 13:08:38 Then what? An a 10?

<@706717603258957864> what f 22 can still beat rhe f 35 your ignoring the f 22 maneuverability and its literally design to be a air superiority dogfight fighter while your only talk about an hud? Like you really think that while f 22 is on f 35 tail he can "turn his head and shoot a missile which it can somehow turn and hit the f 22 while it was on f 35 tails" thats not how it works???
creations-chat 2022-11-03 13:13:18 I mean the "f 22 on f 35 tails" the f 22 can just fire a missile on a f 35 while it was on there tail and there's no way f 35 can avoid that

<@728020153920520213> literally said it as a joke not a actual thing
creations-chat 2022-11-03 13:15:42 Using quroa as a source........

"The answer is that the F-35 cannot match the F-22 as an air superiority fighter—it was never designed as such. The U.S. Air Force’s original plan was for the F-22 to be its high-end air superiority fighter while the F-35 was designed to be primarily an air-to-ground strike aircraft, but one which could defend itself. Thus, while the Raptor was designed with a very high degree of stealth, exceptional kinematic performance and extreme maneuverability, the JSF was designed to be stealthy, networked and have exceptional sensors, but with aerodynamic performance only comparable to a F-16 Fighting Falcon or F/A-18 Hornet. Thus, the aircraft are designed to be complementary to each other "
creations-chat 2022-11-03 13:18:21 Besides quroa has a potential to be biased or outright lie and a propaganda so don't use "quora" as a source and use less biased websites
creations-chat 2022-11-03 13:33:47 I never said that f 35 can't shoot off boresight? I'm saying that a f 22 that is literally design to be a dogfight air superiority fighter with 2d thrust vectoring against an f 35 that would have aim 9x (obviously the f 22 would have it later as well) and a hud? I mean its understandable that it could beat a f 22
Cutt off since  you want me to stop typing so yea... I would stop typing  <:trollface:775024642104229898>
creations-chat 2022-11-03 14:03:51 Excuse me you didn't see the "potential"? I'm not saying that quora is a biased website that only russian people would go there since its a copium website no that's not what I meant and what I meant is  that quoran answer could be BIASED since it's a q & a website and the "image" you shown me just said that quoran answer could be biased and what does it have to do with f 35 can't shoot off boresight?? 

And also you probably lost your cool so I would stop typing again <:trollface:775024642104229898>

creations-chat 2022-11-05 09:49:39 and also your not suppose to post wip builds on creation so except to be deleted and get warned from it
creations-chat 2022-11-06 02:33:42 "Arguments are important" well actually it really depends what your arguing on like arguing that su 57 can't beat an f 22 is NOT important since it would be very rare that they would encounter dosent really effect anything on your life and etc and  argument that is important is things like how do we exist and how humanity started and is big bang theory really true? It would be very important in the later life so we would know why do we exist and etc

creations-chat 2022-11-24 11:01:34 Goddamn nightmare is typing so long I suggest you copy the whole thing before you paste since it MIGHT be remove because mee6 would be dumb and delete it since they thought your "a bot"
creations-chat 2022-11-24 11:10:12 Ah yes calling someone that you copy the eurofighter EVEN THO like most of the eurofighter I've seen are literally like LITERALLY indentical so I don't get why would someone get make fun of when there are always other builds that is similar to the "master builder"
creations-chat 2022-11-24 13:54:05 woah woah thats wayy too much motorlock exposd ngl
creations-chat 2022-11-24 14:11:47 nahh the plane is fine but the motorlock...... you put too much motorlock that it just damage the image
creations-chat 2022-11-24 14:17:26 i love where the "thin ass paper jets" are suppose to be that just so they can be more smaller and not for design but after namaam channel has its boom pvp jets standard turn 1.5 wide plane into 1 block wide plane and create ugl paper jets

creations-chat 2022-12-08 02:16:44 Technically it just a showcase of canard that he's just finished doing it so it technically isn't a WIP since he's already finished doing the canard
creations-chat 2022-12-08 02:21:13 But the thing is he's just showcasing the canard of an eurofighter which technically is considered canard as a build itself which I'm pretty sure he's finish with the canards

<@441125486312030221> no you can literally scroll up and see the unpainted build thst is already finish and have tons of upvotes
creations-chat 2022-12-08 02:23:25 Also NOT ALL BUILDS NEEDS TO HAVE IT'S PLANE ITSELF and if I have to follow your "logic" I could say showing the  kitchen stove on creation isn't allowed since it "should be part of the kitchen room" which doesn't make sense at all or showing toilets isn't allowed since it should be part with the su 34
creations-chat 2022-12-08 02:29:28 Or I could say that showing the build of a finished cockpit isn't allowed because "it needs the plane full body itself" which I have no plan for that
creations-chat 2022-12-08 06:52:44 Nah are you serious 💀

creations-chat 2022-12-12 07:26:13 I mean shredder fall of so bad that the only thing I see shredder bug to be atleast a bit effective is to blacklist everyone and thus easily shred them but besides that yea
creations-chat 2022-12-12 07:31:33 I personally disagree with that since using a tut plane or using a normal vehicle it actually easy to not get shredded by the shredder ball so it and it's not even that hard to defeat the shredder ball so your basically are wrong
creations-chat 2022-12-12 07:35:15 Are there a youtube channel about CSA? I would shit on em if it actually exist
creations-chat 2022-12-12 07:37:44 LMAOOOOOOO

creations-chat 2022-12-12 08:43:12 That's the point? To annoy the CSA until they colapse or disslove? What's the point of making a group then? Like seriously what the fucking point of the group then? It's a anti shredder movement so ofc we are gonna annoy them
creations-chat 2022-12-12 08:45:15 I love the fact that they hated the group just because they "harass him and the CSA" even tho that's literally the point of the group to exist
creations-chat 2022-12-12 08:47:54 Yea I literally don't understand when he say "oh stop making groups to harras jus and annoy the CSA" even tho that's Literally the fucking point of the group creation
creations-chat 2022-12-12 10:05:16 He probably use it for pvp
creations-chat 2022-12-12 12:43:56 LMAOOO BRO exposed him so hard
creations-chat 2022-12-12 12:47:40 Yea when he says that his shredder is so "good" and almost all group against CSA has failed I actually almost believe him and I thought again "really? It has less member so there's actually no way that he has strong tech go defeat" almost all fighter"he's really like that one guy thst would say that his new "invention" its better than what it actually is
creations-chat 2022-12-12 13:04:08 Go check his last message its laughable to see him so overconfident and say that "it's sad to see so many groups failed to counter the CSA and him"

creations-chat 2022-12-27 19:41:26 You do know that we've seen more better jet than that and besides it dosent even look good for the people that obviously seen more better jets

Wanna know why? Because this build look like a pvp one and usually planes that are focus purely on pvp and not for design would sacrifice their detail inexchange for greater maneuverability and I get that but creation is meant to show your great effort and detail on your aircraft and obviously this isn't really that much of an effort in design since it looks Moe of a pvp jet than a detail jet

(note here this is me assuming that this is a pvp jet I am not sure if it is or not)
help 2022-12-27 19:43:34 I don't really have a private server + I am not higher rank than a whitename so unfortunately I can't join the pcc private server <:ElonSad:573361014112780303>
creations-chat 2022-12-27 19:46:13 That's practically the reason why they don't like that kind of build, almost no effort

Also I don't suggest to use namnamm guide as a thing to use almost every build if you cared about teh detail and showing your whole aircraft and use a other guide for details

<@741020959796101174> no I'm sure no one got banned from suing Shader but it's still risky dispite no one getting banned so gl
creations-chat 2022-12-27 19:48:25 Suprsingly I don't see anything wrong I mean most of the time when I see someone su 35 I usually see the problem but this? Perfect

The only thing I would personally change is the paint I would like to choose mountain paint scheme but then again it's a recommendation so gl with your flanker
creations-chat 2022-12-27 19:51:44 Heck I even suprise you put out small detail that I usually forget although checking on it again I only see one problem and that is the landing gear

The landing gear looks god awful and I really suggest to change it to more better appearances but other than that its still a good build
creations-chat 2022-12-27 19:54:42 Eh a typical normal landing gear like removing the sign and potentially putting the trails and also please remove that horn it's just make it uglier
creations-chat 2022-12-27 19:57:14 Idk man but I still suggest to fix the landing gear

creations-chat 2023-01-02 14:09:26 Yo os fucking realistic bro1! 1!1!1!
creations-chat 2023-01-02 14:13:15 The main wing look too short and the engine are not suppose to touch it. Atleast overlay the blueprint for once so that you don't have to tell other people what's wrong with it
creations-chat 2023-01-02 15:18:11 Wydm?
creations-chat 2023-01-02 15:24:13 Also that build: a long long time ago when that is literally the first 1x1 jet build

And don't even try to use my recent build since I mostly build it for pvp and NOT for detail, design etc
creations-chat 2023-01-02 15:27:41 Mate this is like May 11th 2022
creations-chat 2023-01-02 15:30:10 Eh? Doubt it. Plus that su 57 I built was suppose to be scrapped and delete but I just left it alone and take a break on plane crazy till I came back and decide to work on my su 57 which I finally make the whole plane stable
creations-chat 2023-01-02 15:33:26 Cool ig
creations-chat 2023-01-02 15:57:23 Just chat till you get to lvl 3
creations-chat 2023-01-02 17:21:46 You can just motorlock the flaps without the contr surface and it can fly while although sometimes it can suck while rolling so it can eb quite annoying at some time
creations-chat 2023-01-02 17:31:48 Just put the propeller under the wing (or intake if you care about detail) <:trollface:775024642104229898>
creations-chat 2023-01-02 17:35:37 Aww lame but uhh thinking about eh wing again... I'm sure I definitely say many times about just overlaying the blueprint bot when you do that with the wing now... It doesn't look good fr and not close to the actual wing
creations-chat 2023-01-02 17:38:17 Door to point out that

Well time to go back to Sleep then
creations-chat 2023-01-02 17:42:49 Well what I really meant is the lerx are supposed to be more closer to the cockpit  and the wing still look less wide and the engine aren't suppose to connect each other and the intake are suppose to be connected with the engine

Also I suggest to change the color since it look AWFULLY similar to mad vulpen (not in a tutorial way obviously) su 35

Anyways ill go back to sleep so I can't answer it back
creations-chat 2023-01-02 17:45:07 It would be a pain to try to use it in vip or pvp server<:empty:794431705070174238>
creations-chat 2023-01-02 17:47:40 Get wot?
creations-chat 2023-01-02 17:52:04 Should be easy, kinda suprise you failed thst

creations-chat 2023-01-03 06:47:19 fuck.... you.
creations-chat 2023-01-03 06:50:43 I welcome harsh criticism on my x 02

Besides the damn "Uhh why is it 1x1! 1!1!11! Instant bad build" - 🤓
creations-chat 2023-01-03 06:56:23 Bleh I don't really like the engine and why is the spiky thingy on the back shorter than the engine? And the pitch wing look too short IMO not a great build but comparable to mine ig
creations-chat 2023-01-03 06:58:43 The canopy is very VERY hard to try to recreate without trying to make it too big or too short so I just give up and make the su 30 cockpit instead
And also the intake is just 1 block so no worries

<@495210490172014612> true but that dosent really mean that your build is perfect as well there are some flaws that is just hard to not point it out
creations-chat 2023-01-03 07:02:30 I get it by using angle lock, camlock or smt but I heavily don't like the idea of using angler lock especially on a build that is both pvp and for showcasing my plane since there is MANY mess in motorlock that I can't really fit the angle lock besides putting another motorlock but that would ALSO effect the filght and agility of the aircraft since the last time I put many motorlock on my plane it slows the plane the more I put it but I'll put that as an idea
creations-chat 2023-01-03 07:10:34 Welp ig ill use that idea once I got unbanned from roblox

Also <@495210490172014612>

creations-chat 2023-01-03 14:55:52 True but that doesn't mean that its not bigger than ah 1z

Yea gl with that
creations-chat 2023-01-04 17:00:49 Lammee, it look quite amazing
creations-chat 2023-01-04 17:05:16 I would really want to see the whole build being finished, maybe I recommend not focusing too much on the cockpit and the nose and focus on other detail
creations-chat 2023-01-04 17:09:52 I get what your trying to say but at the end of the day it's just a recommendation so you don't always have to follow

So good luck ig
creations-chat 2023-01-04 17:20:56 Who says that they can't use Shader? <:clueless:942802644043464734>

"bu-bu BUT IT DOSENT MAKE THE BUILD GOOD" - 🤓

And so what? They make the build look good and most people would usually think that without the Shader the build would look the same, idk man I don't see the problem here

High standard plane crazy players be like:
creations-chat 2023-01-04 17:25:04 What? There's a thing where you can use Shader as long if you have permission from the olane crazy mods
creations-chat 2023-01-04 17:27:45 Besides you can use Shader by dming ricjke for Shader whitelist so that the anti cheat won't assume that your hacking and kick everyone and ban you from the game
creations-chat 2023-01-04 17:29:50 I'm probably wrong but someone told me that for some reason
creations-chat 2023-01-04 17:32:07 Your probably are correct on this one since I'm not sure

creations-chat 2023-01-07 10:32:07 The wing isnt thick and looks bad, who tf use jet engine as a actual jet engine this days, it dosent look good with the jet engine, and lastly the cockpit is literally look like a mapvulpen tutorial
creations-chat 2023-01-07 10:36:12 Ahhh. You must be a new guy here
Mad vulpen is basically a youtuber (used) to make a bunch of tutorial like the a 10,f 14, su 25 etc and there's so many and so popular that people usually use his tutorial and although half of it is shit the other half is alr
(note here that the reason why the madvuplen tutorial look shit is because it's for beginners and so the video isn't too long that the people would ignore it because they think it's too complicated and long) 

Just go on his channel and scroll down and you would basically you would see so much of his tutorial
creations-chat 2023-01-07 10:40:43 He's still are making a tutorial but it's not much as he did a year ago plus he's actually a good builder
creations-chat 2023-01-07 11:32:04 isnt that the same guy that posted a f 14 tut into creation LOL
creations-chat 2023-01-07 14:22:21 Obviously map vulpen tutorial sucks and shit but besides that he's a good build I must admit
creations-chat 2023-01-07 17:43:49 ^^^^

Just deal with it. The toxicity rule on creation chat rarely get people banned and the rules isn't enforced
So expect to get shitted on your build
creations-chat 2023-01-07 17:47:00 Yea but I do hate where sometimes when I ask for criticism about my fighter jets they literally ignored or say little of the criticism, this shows that if you don't want to get shitted on, just get a build is atleast decent enough that you won't get shitted on <:trollface:775024642104229898>
creations-chat 2023-01-07 17:52:15 The only downside is there might be a day where your having way too much fun on the other game to the point where you either forgot or ignore plane crazy

Which think of it, this is a actual good benifits for the newbies so that they don't have to get shitted on alot
creations-chat 2023-01-07 18:27:28 Bro what 💀 there shouldn't be any problem uploading up mate if there are a problem posting it just simply make a new  screenshot of the new shredder a try repost again

And if it don work then idk
creations-chat 2023-01-07 19:41:04 Bro wtf shredder is that 💀
I've seen more overpowered shredder and although I hate it, it's clearly look more better than yours
creations-chat 2023-01-08 02:44:28 How could you mess up the nose and aircraft so badly. No like seriously wtf is that nose? Why is it bulky af, and the cockpit.. Wtf is that?? It look nothing similar to it and what is that intake??? It's not even at the same place where the su 47 intake is and why is it so High up even tho its suppose to be more lower than that and its not even sqare. HOW DID YOU FAIL THAT BADLY
creations-chat 2023-01-08 02:47:43 Actually overlay the blueprint please. It doesn't even look good at all nor is it accurate
creations-chat 2023-01-08 02:50:46 >Literally show his su 47

creations-chat 2023-01-09 14:52:42 How to post shityy builds whule getting upvotes (not in a joke way! 1!1!)

1.force your freind to join into your private server with eh best tank he ever have

2. Bring your shitty tank and go next to the very detail tank

3.take a screenshot and post it in plane crazy creation
And you have done it
creations-chat 2023-01-09 15:00:52 It's clearly a joke I made and isnt intended to be serious
creations-chat 2023-01-09 15:45:34 Sir you do know that there's a huge difference about joking about it and being serious

Plus I've never been mad to you, had I actually been mad why tf would I make that whole (how to do tutorial) shit, you clearly know its a joke and yet you take this seriously

Your a pefect guy to be a normal twitter user tbh
creations-chat 2023-01-09 15:49:10 When tf did I say it was a tutorial 💀

I mena sure I might be harsh on you because I called the build shitty or whatever word it is but I thought that tank was a joke??? You never said that your freind helped you build it untill now, you put nerd and raised eyebrown emoji making me think that this build was a joke
creations-chat 2023-01-09 15:51:55 It's still dosent make a difference, what I said about the (how to post shitty build) is clearly a joke and never intended to caused harm to you and your freind
creations-chat 2023-01-09 15:56:43 Checking back at the joke I make I do have to admit that I may be being too harsh on it but i thought that  the white tank was a joke so I am extremely sorry if I'm being a little too harsh on the joke

<@624337412293656621> d8d you actually try to look at the argument or not
creations-chat 2023-01-09 16:01:34 Yea true, when he started the argument I didntreally understand what he's trying to say? He just say things like "wtf do you mean shitty" "oh i didnt force him to make it", "get a life mate" it's VERY VERY clear that he does not understand the joke at first and when I said it was clearly a joke he basically said that I was "too rude" or "too harsh" about it which YES I admit it was too harsh but it's STILL clearly a joke and I thought that the white tank was a joke too and I'm extremely sorry for jt

You have to admit that he's basically a good fit for a normal twitter user ngl <:clueless:942802644043464734>

Welp gonna go to sleep now

<@456226577798135808> dont listen to him, he's trying to trick you to get warned and get blacklist creation for a while 💀
creations-chat 2023-01-10 22:39:16 
creations-chat 2023-01-11 06:33:56 Bruh. He literally answer someone question and you go "bu- bu- but why do you want to do that??" he literally just answer his question what are you trying to say?
creations-chat 2023-01-11 06:42:46 What the fuck are you trying to say???
 He never said that "Uhh fighter jet is better against a biplane because it can beat in a dogfight" NO HE NEVER SAID THAT
He meant that most of the fighter jet that they post on creation ACTUALLY look good unlike your biplane who look very simple and lacking detail

And also just because you put "fighter jet is overrated" on your biplane DOSENT make an excuse that your plane look bad and very simple unlike other fighter
creations-chat 2023-01-11 06:47:16 So what are you trying to argue? That your biplane could've get upvote had it not for fighter jet being overrated?
Get this. even if in a alternate history where biplane are more popular than fighter jet for some reason your build is still gonna get downvote either way since it dosent really look good it's is very Zvery simple and lacking many detail you could've put in
creations-chat 2023-01-11 06:51:38 True, the airship look good but if you use it in plane crazy standard it's average enough that you would expect upvotes rather than downvote
creations-chat 2023-01-11 06:58:05 then why dont you yourself become that person
creations-chat 2023-01-11 07:32:03 Especially the Mike one and he complain about it <:OmegaTroll:626841385118597152>
creations-chat 2023-01-11 08:23:13 BRO HE DELETE ALL OF THE MESSAGE LMAOOOOOO
creations-chat 2023-01-11 08:27:18 This is the same guy who send this biplane in creation, got downvote badly and say that fighter jet is overrated and proceed to have a argument with it 💀
creations-chat 2023-01-11 08:53:33 Agreed.
creations-chat 2023-01-11 10:45:46 When you can see the intake on top of the f 16 you know it's bad

Cockpit is too big while the canopy is too short and it look horrid ngl , and the wing is too wide and too short and the elevator is too pointy and the vertical wing ehh, maybe too short? And the intake exposed on top of the aircraft so you should need to cover it using detla 1x4 or smt like that  and the nose should be more pointy

In short just use the blueprint overlay
help 2023-01-11 11:25:35 Wydm by a "big plane"

creations-chat 2023-01-15 01:49:37 the engine aren't suppose to touch with the elevator and the main wing and too extreme close to the cockpit than its actually suppose to be and the main wing look more mig 29sh rather than a flanker and the vertical stablizer is too long and the canopy is too big ig and the lerx are too short

Overall the plane dosent even look good and and look NOTHING similar to the su 35 and look more mig 29ish tbh I'm suprise it got upvoted even tho it dosent even good good
creations-chat 2023-01-15 01:52:16 nice try pulling that of but that's literally like a long time ago 💀  and just because I made a build that is quite a long time dosent make an excuse that the build is still bad
creations-chat 2023-01-15 01:54:55 Yea the su 35 it just bad? What are you trying to say? I don't even get why your pulling my builds?? That my build is trash even tho that build is like November 9th 2022? plus that build is scraped anyways it was never finish I seriously don't get what your trying to say

<@434843195025653762> yea THAT'S WHAT I MEANT BY THAT
creations-chat 2023-01-15 01:57:07 I mean 3 months is sure long enough to improve your skill so idk man
creations-chat 2023-01-15 01:59:14 I seriously don't get what extikal is talking about?? Like if my build is bad that is like 9th November 2022 and was scraped and never finsished that means all of my criticism about the su 35 is wrong? That's clearly not how it works and just pure unnecessary to pull my builds as a "defence"
creations-chat 2023-01-15 02:03:44 It's true that I was being harsh and I should've known that but I was still confuse why is the build got upvotes when ti dosent look like one, but when it said that It does look like I was being harsh so sorry if I was being harsh with that
creations-chat 2023-01-15 02:06:02 Alr then
creations-chat 2023-01-15 02:08:05 Yea hyperbot is the most toxic people I ever met, always downvoting and not putting upvote on a good build or vice versa, hyperbot always pretends to be a bot and always broken man
creations-chat 2023-01-15 02:11:23 ig your grandpa can't compete who can smoke more with the pumpkin

alr I'll admit the joke was very bad
creations-chat 2023-01-15 02:15:08 That's probably not how to make fun of someone death
creations-chat 2023-01-15 02:18:07 Sir stop using twitter.
creations-chat 2023-01-15 03:17:33 There's literally difference about rolscale and mini

And your plane is literally considered a mini, not a rolscale
creations-chat 2023-01-15 03:26:23 "Rolscale basically means that an **accrate size for the roblox character** and is based on of real sizes such as human and vehicle"

And i repeat it HAS TO BE A ACCRATE SIZE AS THE ROBLOX CHARACTER and seeing your bf 109 clearly seeing a roblox character STICKING THEIR ARMS is clearly violate the rules of an "Rolscale" and its a ROBLOX CHARACTER sizes and NOT a actual human

I sure if that's an actual bf 109 this guy wouldn't have an arm
creations-chat 2023-01-15 03:30:54 Bruv I could make an avatar as small as a cat and all of my mini fighters could easily considered as a rolscale and not a mini

And I'm sure that he meant the blocky style NOT your actual roblox character
creations-chat 2023-01-15 03:37:38 What? What did I say again? "accurate size to a roblox character"when tf did I say you have to compare it with a actual human? No? Ofc not I meant it HAS to compare with a roblox character otherwise would it really be called "Rolscale" if your changing the character closer a real human as opposed to using a blocky character that people use it as a rolscale
creations-chat 2023-01-15 03:39:54 Pretty sure that it's against the rules of discord
creations-chat 2023-01-15 05:41:25 "GRRR SHADERS DOSENT MAKE THE BUILD BETTER" - some nerd 🤓
creations-chat 2023-01-15 05:44:03 THAT'S THE POINT, THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT but the people still are not buying it

This for example:
creations-chat 2023-01-15 05:46:25 All is alright but the cockpit just look bad tbh, I get you can't really do anything but that sadly dosent make an excuse that it's just bad.
creations-chat 2023-01-15 05:49:15 Yea it could've been pefect if it hadn't be the cockpit itself

creations-chat 2023-01-15 15:25:14 Plane? 
And idk man, it looks fine ut it's just average and lacking many details and just, isn't good so I doubt that you would get upvotes

I'm not it saying the build is bad but you could improve it more by putting more detail ig
creations-chat 2023-01-15 15:27:24 it's alr and could be improve with details and such stuff
creations-chat 2023-01-15 15:34:36 Nahh bro I'm suprise that people still think that su 27 is the same size as mig 29

<@456226577798135808>  Also su 27 isn't that big, it's just the wing and the tail boom is what made it look big in reality it's just silghtly the shorter size as an f 15 if you don't count tail boom ofc
creations-chat 2023-01-15 15:38:21 <@584060481522761728> forgor reply 
I mean its kinda unfair to compare a fighter that is designed for dogfighting and has a twin engine, tail boom etc that make the plane more larger and more of a competitor to an f 22 rather than a f 35 which only focus on BVR only have one engine and dosent really dogfight
creations-chat 2023-01-15 15:44:37 Infact it was the most downogted plane in plane crazy <:trollface:775024642104229898>

creations-chat 2023-01-17 11:24:15 Bet that he would say that this sint a feedback since he didn't explain how to fix it or put detail etc
creations-chat 2023-01-17 12:27:48 It's Literally the slightly shorter than f 15 it's just the tailboom and the wing make it look more larger than it actually is
creations-chat 2023-01-17 13:18:56 Agreed but in rolescale I'm sure that f 15 should be easy to make and I doubt the flanker would be hard too since they are partically the same size except the tailboom and the wing made it look bigger but it just look bigger when side by side
creations-chat 2023-01-17 13:28:03 Probably a joke, he's a mod on namnamm server so most likely

creations-chat 2023-01-29 12:46:16 lmao
creations-chat 2023-01-29 19:01:34 I'm mean they probably didn't remove it since the mods are fatass enough to remove it <:trollface:775024642104229898>
creations-chat 2023-01-30 13:02:58 Then again the entirety of the game is unrealistic so I can't see what do you mean by that
creations-chat 2023-01-30 16:36:59 Al that sh60 does look incredibly messy so I am not surprised
creations-chat 2023-01-30 16:53:50 You are just incredibly so stupid and wrong, it's powered by a star wars engine that can go miles and miles away
creations-chat 2023-01-31 14:57:01 Why does the nose look like someone with one teeth 💀
creations-chat 2023-01-31 15:05:28 
creations-chat 2023-01-31 15:38:12 You either hate the color or you hate 1x1 block

Either way your opinion sucks ngl
creations-chat 2023-01-31 15:50:07 Truv but thst doesn't really Nessearly mean that this plane is bad, its just at the right timing where many whitenames goes to see <#384025409945337856>
creations-chat 2023-01-31 15:54:42 The build isn't really that bad at all but since it was posted at the right timing when there are alot do whitenames going to <#384025409945337856> that would usually happen

Yea at this point, ranks are solely for the purpose of being a thing so you won't get targeted and called by a whitenames and get more image perms

creations-chat 2023-02-02 08:48:06 He said it as a joke 💀
creations-chat 2023-02-02 08:51:56 Ah yes ofc it looks great
creations-chat 2023-02-02 08:57:10 I am actually suprised I'm the first one to give you an compliment, either the people actually think that the build is somewhat bad for som reason

Or problably since we saw the same f 14 mutliple times in <#384025409945337856> that if you put in 2 extremely detailed f 14 you can't tell the difference
creations-chat 2023-02-02 09:45:36 Nice
creations-chat 2023-02-02 09:47:38 <@456226577798135808> isnt that literally just a naamamm flanker with custom cockpit
creations-chat 2023-02-02 10:25:40 Bro what the fuck are you talking about 💀 
he downvoted because its literally low effort and outright trash

And you just suddenly call him out and said "dude downvoted my haybale sport thinking it would do something" even tho be literally just downvote because it's just trash

It's clear your are a attention seeker, trying to piss someone off <:clueless:942802644043464734>

creations-chat 2023-02-04 01:32:38 I mean that's build is literally a joke LMAOOO, this is WHAT shit he makes

Please do an actual look up on him before trying to make fun of his obvious troll build <:trollface:775024642104229898>
creations-chat 2023-02-04 01:37:33 ^^^^
Ignore all of the replies they send, they all trolls looking to piss you off, don't feed the trolls here (besides <@883063424614006878> <:trollface:775024642104229898> )
creations-chat 2023-02-04 01:40:26 Oh LOL, I may be doing way too quick research lemme search actual builds and not stolen

<@736212564337492040> it used to be, but it's slowly not getting enforced and later the mods even use it lol
creations-chat 2023-02-04 01:43:14 Bro he's isn't telling that as an opinion LOL, he is informing you that it's it's gonna get you builed and make fun of so it's better not to use it

Also how much copium are you sucking? Lmao
creations-chat 2023-02-04 01:48:15 "7 grams a day through my nose" holy shit you really gonna stop coping and ignoring trolls here <:trollface:775024642104229898>
He is IMFORMING you that it's better not you use it, like getting imformed in the cafeteria that there is a money stealer here, even if its not important to you, you are still imformed just incase if there is someone with the money stolen

And also what'd you expect a PCC community to treat you? At the end of the day they are just gonna get you to pissed off and making you look like a cryboy even more

Here's a tip, don't argue and feed the trolls, just let them think that he's better than you, it's way better than getting bullied by them because you decide to fight back, just take a rest in the Internet.
creations-chat 2023-02-04 01:51:11 Yea true but I'm pretty sure he treated likr you're a troll <:trollface:775024642104229898>
creations-chat 2023-02-04 01:54:55 "me literally gave you an advice to stop feeding the trolls"
Also you: proceed to coutinue arguing after i gave a advice about it

Please just ignore the trolls, they are here just to piss you off

<@200793484053970944>  yea <:empty:794431705070174238>

creations-chat 2023-02-05 03:58:41 Isn't <@389516889501728779> famous because of especially his youtube videos about **SHOOTING DOWN** shredders and pvp stuff? Suprised you didn't know about him <:stuff:908917207986208828>
creations-chat 2023-02-05 04:01:02 Oh god you really never watch his video/research about it
creations-chat 2023-02-05 04:03:58 I mean it doesn't have to take that much of effort to just go on his videos and check the titles and the thumbnail to know he is anti shredder

And he is a anti shredder <:stuff:908917207986208828>
creations-chat 2023-02-05 04:17:09 It's almost seems like, he already told you that it's literally 3 fucking years ago? Hmmmm I wonder if you actually read his message or not
creations-chat 2023-02-05 04:20:44 It's also seems like that bomber is  made entirely for pvp and dosnet even have any detail or motorlock at all

And that f 15 you showed is also for pvp too and ISNT for detail and dosent even have motorlock

Smh learn the difference against a PVP jet and a actual effort detail jet.
creations-chat 2023-02-05 04:24:47 Have you liek still learn a diffence about a PVP jet and a actual effort jet? If you do there's a reason why gjsolo made it instead of making detail jets

And also I'm sure putting wing panel can cause lag as my X 02 (the fps feels so blocky af) and can effect your PVP

Please LEARN the difference between PVP jet and a jet for detail and showcase
creations-chat 2023-02-05 04:27:47 Oh my fucking god how many times do we have to fucking say

LEARN THE DIFFERENCE ALREADY

motorlocked bombs literally temporarily and is extremely useful for pvp and if you want to increase your agility of the jet you could just drop the bombs and you would feel lighter

And just like Gjsolo said (motorlocking adds lag and more wing adds drag)

Please just LEARN the difference mate.
creations-chat 2023-02-05 04:30:54 Me building up a paragraph why is "is motorlocked bombs is alr but motorlock wing isnt" is stupid af

Your counter argument: "Shut up <:trollface:775024642104229898>"

A clear symbol of loosing an argument <:OmegaTroll:626841385118597152>
creations-chat 2023-02-06 04:09:23 Why does hyperbot keep being toxic
creations-chat 2023-02-07 17:59:15 Holyiy shit what the fuck is this argument LMAOOOO

he just wanna post about his hamster died and built a build for him and he straight up insulted you and the hamster? Pure pathetic.
creations-chat 2023-02-07 18:05:48 Yea it's extremely clear that he is just an asshole who is probably a teenager who think being egdy/mocking you and their death pet is OK and funny, pure pathetic to him and probably his life

Anyways I don't suggest continue this argument since thye are literally arguing just os they can piss you off and making you look like cry baby
Then again, this is the Internet and it is inevitable that there would be trolls and asshole doing this on PCC community and its ashame that its true since PCC community was known by its extreme toxicity.
creations-chat 2023-02-07 18:15:36 He is joking about getting downvoted and asking if the builds OK, are you mentally insane?
creations-chat 2023-02-07 20:15:15 Average ngl
creations-chat 2023-02-07 20:20:03 It's actually shit if your putting in a PCC standard but yea
