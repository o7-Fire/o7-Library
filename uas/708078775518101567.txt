creations-chat 2021-05-05 18:25:49 <@!634037409020903444> About the white cube, why?
creations-chat 2021-05-05 18:29:13 By that logic literally everything in plane crazy is bad because it copied real life. Something has air? Automatically bad because real life has air and it copied real life.

creations-chat 2022-01-24 12:13:23 Damn, I didn't expect to get 120 likes on my first post, that's what I want to know lmao
creations-chat 2022-01-24 12:18:26 It's got the tall crust, caramel stuffed inside, and ice cream scoop on top with a little glazing around the edges
creations-chat 2022-01-24 12:21:18 I consider 30 upvotes with less than 10 downvotes a success
creations-chat 2022-06-02 15:03:18 <@723940197456281640> my guy that‚Äôs not a schooner
creations-chat 2022-06-02 15:06:53 Schooners have tall lengthwise sails, yours just has square sails. Not only does it look like a banana, it‚Äôs not even what you say it is
creations-chat 2022-06-02 15:09:42 Yeah I heard you the first time, just saying maybe you need to get your eyes checked or something because that‚Äôs like super embarrassing
creations-chat 2022-06-16 18:58:12 This man puts the crazy in plane crazy honestly
creations-chat 2022-09-12 12:08:29 <@639374429532717056> yo I love the concept of your build

creations-chat 2022-09-16 18:13:39 He‚Äôs shitposting dummy
creations-chat 2022-09-16 18:15:43 But look at all those details in the forehead, that‚Äôs not just a sand texture, he motorlocked those massive wrinkles in. Even with the exposed motorlock you have to give the build credit where it‚Äôs due
creations-chat 2022-09-16 18:18:51 <@784197207125000202> you‚Äôre an inspiration to the plane crazy community as a whole and me personally, builds are just amazing, so realistic it looks like a picture

creations-chat 2022-09-17 02:16:07 My reaction to that information
creations-chat 2022-09-22 01:30:00 Well it‚Äôs the most I‚Äôve done in a small space, so it‚Äôs a new experience for me
creations-chat 2022-09-22 01:34:26 If I can have some suggestions that‚Äôd be great but there‚Äôs nothing useful about shitting on others builds just because you can do much better
creations-chat 2022-09-22 01:37:08 L opinion then

creations-chat 2023-03-03 15:06:56 Not many people can make a good looking ocean liner with a properly scaled interior that also looks good
creations-chat 2023-04-13 17:10:35 Wow that‚Äôs a great plane crazy creation <@456226577798135808>, what‚Äôs the part count and how did you make it fly?
creations-chat 2023-04-13 17:27:46 The downvotes are from those who are jealous of your build skills manzis
creations-chat 2023-04-14 12:43:35 It‚Äôs called a trash build bro üíÄ imagine using a religion to defend against people disliking what you make
creations-chat 2023-04-14 12:47:14 My brother that 20 minute, 50 part build is an insult to Islam, no disrespect but if it was done right I can assure you that it would get more upvotes regardless of religion
creations-chat 2023-04-14 12:49:32 It IS you being way too religious, 15 year old extremist ‚Äúfight for my country‚Äù debating politics on roblox martyr looking ass
