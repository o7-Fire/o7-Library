creations-chat 2022-08-09 21:36:10 the panther is basically just an upgrade of the tiger 2, the panther is more angled or chizeled for better armor, the turret is wider than the tiger 1, but it was also hard to build, the images i was looking up wasn't really good with the angles and the height of the turret is a little short, and for the barrel it would look better if it got smaller at the end but the barrel is half on over the tank and half infront of the tank, it would probably look better at a different angle but i understand what ur trying to say.
creations-chat 2022-08-09 21:40:03 what did you say that got deleted (dm me if u want)
creations-chat 2022-08-09 21:44:12 yeah, it didnt look the best, probably gonna make other over scalled tanks but hopefully they look better
