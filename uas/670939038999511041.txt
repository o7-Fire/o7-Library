creations-chat 2020-02-26 19:42:14 what do u think of my MiG 25 ?(btw started playing 3 days ago)
creations-chat 2020-02-26 19:45:41 it makes a speed of 650, with boost of a build.in conveyor engine 7000-8000(controllable till 2500)
creations-chat 2020-02-26 19:50:56 and my other two builds : a chopper and a concorde
creations-chat 2020-02-26 19:50:57 
creations-chat 2020-02-26 19:50:58 
creations-chat 2020-02-26 20:01:47 <@!265484911912288257> idk... seems like everyone downvotes everything...
creations-chat 2020-02-26 20:36:14 i did my best to copy it, but proper jet noses are hard to build in this game
creations-chat 2020-02-26 20:42:51 but i have to admit, the heli didnt went out that well, and i dont like the nose of my concorde too
creations-chat 2020-02-26 20:45:04 but when i built it i didnt know u have settings for motors, but i will build a better nose now
creations-chat 2020-02-27 21:40:04 guys u didnt like my first MiG 25, but here is the second :
creations-chat 2020-02-27 21:40:46 its powered by one low tuned conveyor-engine, making insane speeds
creations-chat 2020-02-27 21:41:28 its also extremely manuverable and tiny, what makes it perfect for combat
creations-chat 2020-02-27 21:43:04 and due to the conveyor engine there is still enough space for bombs ; )
creations-chat 2020-02-27 21:44:41 gonna try to build it with conventional engines though, to get proper acceleration and braking, not that laggy stuff
creations-chat 2020-02-27 21:45:02 btw its 285 pieces only
creations-chat 2020-02-27 21:46:15 i have the conveyor speed only on 10 of 50 or so
creations-chat 2020-02-27 21:47:01 the clue behind making the conveyor so slow is to get great steering
creations-chat 2020-02-27 21:47:16 <@!287779983445721088> why ?
creations-chat 2020-02-27 21:48:00 thats just how the real MiG 25 looks <@!287779983445721088>
creations-chat 2020-02-27 21:48:26 just google it
creations-chat 2020-02-27 21:49:26 shell i build another jet, and wich one ?(with a "proper" hatch)
creations-chat 2020-02-27 21:50:21 <@456226577798135808> go on YT, its basicly a piston, a conveyor, 6 blocks and a half block
creations-chat 2020-02-27 21:51:15 <@!287779983445721088> me262 is hard, modern jets would be better for this game
creations-chat 2020-02-27 21:52:12 if i build it bigger it would be ok, but i like to build small
creations-chat 2020-02-27 21:53:10 <@!287779983445721088> i put one engine in a 2400 block concorde and it goes into space with a speed of 1500-3000+
creations-chat 2020-02-27 21:54:01 the nose of that concorde is ugly though
creations-chat 2020-02-27 21:56:48 the conveyor doesnt care about the blocks, it just ever goes the same spped
creations-chat 2020-02-27 22:02:46 not really
creations-chat 2020-02-27 22:03:50 my big MiG 25 (780 blocks) goes 7000-8000+
creations-chat 2020-02-27 22:06:52 idk man
creations-chat 2020-02-27 22:08:04 its to short, tracks are to this, surfaces aint right, and the gun is just... uhmm...
creations-chat 2020-02-27 22:09:30 make it 4 blocks thinner and double the tracks, that may help
creations-chat 2020-02-27 22:09:59 and get a angle at the front
creations-chat 2020-02-27 22:13:28 do u have WoT , WoT Blitz or WarThunder ?
creations-chat 2020-02-27 22:13:53 there u can see it
creations-chat 2020-02-27 22:15:23 see u have to make it smaller
creations-chat 2020-02-27 22:16:17 oh and the guy wich built that T95 is a small YTer
creations-chat 2020-02-27 22:16:24 lemme see..
creations-chat 2020-02-27 22:16:45 but u may see the building there
help 2020-02-27 22:22:51 <@314383347214319616> can u explain me that designer and engineer stuff pls ?
help 2020-02-27 22:24:03 oh thx
creations-chat 2020-02-27 22:29:09 what can i say...
creations-chat 2020-02-27 22:38:13 well its mainly the nose making it bad, the rest is ok
creations-chat 2020-02-27 22:39:21 and u have to consider thats the second thing i ever built in this game( first was just some testing and playing around)
creations-chat 2020-02-27 22:40:16 <@!287779983445721088> look at pictures, the engines are pretty accurate
creations-chat 2020-02-27 22:41:08 can we met in game so u guys can see it properly ?
creations-chat 2020-02-27 22:41:44 JUST come in game pls
creations-chat 2020-02-27 22:41:57 ooof
creations-chat 2020-02-27 22:42:20 for me its 23:42
creations-chat 2020-02-27 22:43:16 ill try to get proper pictures
creations-chat 2020-02-27 22:47:51 
creations-chat 2020-02-27 22:47:52 
creations-chat 2020-02-27 22:47:54 
creations-chat 2020-02-27 22:48:43 i still think it looks better in game, but these pics are ok
creations-chat 2020-02-27 22:52:20 they are a little bit to wide, but they are positioned right
creations-chat 2020-02-27 22:53:36 oh and the game could use some shadows, just noticing
creations-chat 2020-02-27 22:56:48 uhm
creations-chat 2020-02-27 22:57:22 its a 2400 blocks build with a conveyor engine, and im playing on a 2012 Laptop
creations-chat 2020-02-28 14:01:12 <@!325320982602448897> the hull of ur chaffe looks nice, but i still dont like the turret
creations-chat 2020-02-28 14:03:17 i thnk the turret front needs to be more sharper, more pointed. its to flat atm
help 2020-02-28 14:07:55 guys i need help with my tiny MiG 25 : i tried less angle for the motor control and did build it with conveyor engine, Magnet engine and conventional rockets, but there is ever the same problem : when it goes more then 400 speed, the nose starts wobbeling, the wobbeling increases with the speed. Do u know anything I could do ? (and no its not the server or internet connection)
help 2020-02-28 14:15:03 u mean ballast in the front ? its already pretty noseheavy
creations-chat 2020-02-28 15:28:46 <@!532941920033439764> try making the engine of ur he162 longer, and paint it lke the rest of ur plane
help 2020-02-28 15:33:12 its really simple :
creations-chat 2020-02-28 15:34:00 make the engine longer
creations-chat 2020-02-28 15:35:21 1 in the front, 2 in the back maybe
creations-chat 2020-02-28 20:53:35 Guys here is my SU-47(some changes at the back)
creations-chat 2020-02-28 20:53:36 
creations-chat 2020-02-28 20:53:37 
creations-chat 2020-02-28 20:59:46 its fully motorsteered, powerd by a low tuned conveyorengine and steerable even at high speeds, extrem manuverable. could be used in combat, even room for bombs inside
creations-chat 2020-02-28 21:06:06 a bit blocky, but nice
creations-chat 2020-02-28 21:07:23 oh and i think the guns may be to bit, especially on the middle turret
creations-chat 2020-02-28 21:11:43 the motors have to be bigger and lower, also the turret needs to be smaller. beside from that a nice plane though
creations-chat 2020-02-29 14:26:20 here is a Eurofighter, powered by a conveyor engine, still needs cockpit interior and proper landing gear. Rolls great, pitches hard.
creations-chat 2020-02-29 14:26:21 
creations-chat 2020-02-29 14:26:22 
creations-chat 2020-02-29 14:27:05 controllable at speeds up to 3000
creations-chat 2020-02-29 17:58:54 eventhough its made with a tutorial, its still ugly
creations-chat 2020-03-01 10:06:18 its boring, we had it atleast 10 times here
creations-chat 2020-03-01 10:32:45 <@383178915268526080> that was kind of my idea to use conveyor/ magnet engines to get small, realistic, yet flying Planes. Great build though, would match my SU-47
creations-chat 2020-03-01 10:33:33 or my MiG 25
creations-chat 2020-03-01 10:33:42 (smol one)
creations-chat 2020-03-01 12:22:42 videos wont be accepted
creations-chat 2020-03-01 12:22:49 maybe as a gif
creations-chat 2020-03-02 16:07:19 nice... I see some relations with my small MiG 25😉
creations-chat 2020-03-02 16:09:06 i have a bigger one too
creations-chat 2020-03-02 16:09:25 ppl dont like the bigger ones nose though
creations-chat 2020-03-02 16:09:58 I really like ur idea of guided missiles
creations-chat 2020-03-02 16:10:10 wanna meet ingame ?

creations-chat 2020-03-02 16:14:32 would have to be biiiig
creations-chat 2020-03-02 16:27:00 im gonna do a fantasy jet
creations-chat 2020-03-04 12:08:36 <@!509641743570829312> looks really nice, but i think it needs to be a bit wider
creations-chat 2020-03-05 18:19:24 its really good
creations-chat 2020-03-05 18:20:11 but in my tradition i would implement a conveyor engine

help 2020-03-22 14:43:58 build the Horten IX
help 2020-03-22 14:46:19 ye
help 2020-03-22 14:46:42 229 isnt correct btw
help 2020-03-22 14:47:08 its called by that because in production, it would be the Go-229
help 2020-03-22 14:47:29 but for Horten it has to be IX
help 2020-03-22 14:53:55 ye
help 2020-03-22 14:54:12 the hard thing will be making the engine inlets
help 2020-03-22 14:58:20 there are two options : make it so small noone sees the incorrections or make it huge so u get the curves right
help 2020-03-22 16:20:29 SELF UPVOTE
help 2020-03-22 16:39:12 nice
help 2020-03-22 16:39:22 can I see it ?
help 2020-03-22 16:41:03 oh nice
help 2020-03-22 16:41:54 but I would make the entire wing front the same way
help 2020-03-22 16:42:36 try both and chose what looks best
help 2020-03-22 16:43:49 ik
help 2020-03-22 16:44:07 but I just doesn't look right in this game
help 2020-03-22 16:44:57 I would have a solution to problems like this in <#507673335816126509> .... feel free to upvote it 😉
help 2020-03-22 16:46:39 and I think the entire wing in the same way would look that bad, and the realism isn't that important in the game(can't really reach realistic wings here anyway)
help 2020-03-22 16:53:09 a slightly above picture would be nice
help 2020-03-22 16:55:03 thats better

help 2020-03-22 17:10:15 for a conveyor engine u need 2x1x1 blocks
help 2020-03-22 17:10:24 that should be fine

bug-reports 2020-04-22 09:25:20 <@!252094891448860673> u really need to list more known bugs
bug-reports 2020-04-22 10:51:17 <@!217336009455566848> it only happens to suspensions, and on smaller builds u often can make it not happen by putting a rope to the suspension, also its more likely to happen to bigger builds in general. for this particular build it usually happens when turning while driving on rough terrain. Are u sure its the Roblox physics ? And if it is, could it be a solution to program the suspension in another way ?

I took a closer look at the cylinders and they look like they are not round anymore, and only have maybe 13-17 sides. Why? What was wrong with cylinders beforehand? Why were they changed?
<@!270291665116200962>  it was probably changed for a performance improvement uptate, bcs round stuff decreases the performance massively(it never was exactly round, just a lot more sides, what ofc creates big lag)

suspension and ropes just makes it more likely to happen, put it also occurs with neither of them

creations-chat 2020-08-09 00:13:13 use youtube, streamable, mp4,...
creations-chat 2020-08-09 00:13:23 .wmv can easily be abused
creations-chat 2020-08-09 00:13:31 so its banned on pcc
creations-chat 2020-08-09 00:15:57 > Does .mp4 provide better video quality/better data compression?
im not sure, but it can be watched without downloading. 
a .wmv on the other hand has to be downloaded to be watched and can therefore easily be abused for ip grabs, malware, viruses, etc.
creations-chat 2020-08-09 00:16:12 > Are people saying that WIP things cannot be placed in creations-chat?
<@!311638025308209154> its the rules
creations-chat 2020-08-09 00:16:22 and they are here for a good reason
creations-chat 2020-08-09 00:16:50 is there anything not clear about that ?
creations-chat 2020-08-09 00:18:53 u can post pictures of WIP creations in <#504436696021204992> , <#384021699466756107> and <#478584971670454284> , but **not in <#384025409945337856> **
creations-chat 2020-08-09 00:19:17 its pretty clearly stated in the rules
creations-chat 2020-08-09 00:19:23 so i wonder why he asked
creations-chat 2020-08-09 00:19:59 it does
creations-chat 2020-08-09 00:21:09 if thats not clear enough for someone

we should seriously question if that someone is allowed here
creations-chat 2020-08-09 00:22:03 thats why i said the rule should be enforced harder earlier
creations-chat 2020-08-09 00:22:54 its clear enough
creations-chat 2020-08-09 00:23:02 its just not enforced enough
creations-chat 2020-08-09 00:23:10 thats a big difference
creations-chat 2020-08-09 00:23:51 just bcs the chance the police catches u on a crime is low u still shouldnt comit it
creations-chat 2020-08-09 00:24:41 > i dont even know what misinterpret means

creations-chat 2020-08-09 00:25:10 misinterpret isnt really that much of an english word
creations-chat 2020-08-09 00:25:41 in slight variations its used in a lot of languages as its coming from the latin language

the-dump 2020-08-19 19:32:35 The missile knows where it is at all times. It knows this because it knows where it isn't, by subtracting where it is, from where it isn't, or where it isn't, from where it is, whichever is greater, it obtains a difference, or deviation. The guidance sub-system uses deviations to generate corrective commands to drive the missile from a position where it is, to a position where it isn't, and arriving at a position where it wasn't, it now is. Consequently, the position where it is, is now the position that it wasn't, and it follows that the position where it was, is now the position that it isn't. In the event of the position that it is in is not the position that it wasn't, the system has required a variation. The variation being the difference between where the missile is, and where it wasn't. If variation is considered to be a significant factor, it too, may be corrected by the GEA. However, the missile must also know where it was. The missile guidance computance scenario works as follows: Because a variation has modified some of the information the missile has obtained, it is not sure just where it is, however it is sure where it isn't, within reason, and it knows where it was. It now subracts where it should be, from where it wasn't, or vice versa. By differentiating this from the algebraic sum og where it shouldn't be, and where it was. It is able to obtain a deviation, and a variation, which is called "air"

creations-chat 2020-12-18 15:09:35 lemme guess
"too realistic" "i like blocky builds more"
creations-chat 2020-12-18 15:14:43 each has a own anchor and is attached to the others via cameras and a tnt block. they are placed each by its own

<@!325875263336349696> they somewhat fly, not the quickest due to detailed intake and not much space
creations-chat 2020-12-18 15:18:01 its nothing compared to mi24 or mbt
also with everyone else anchored, graphics at 1 and everything apart from the game itself closed i got some 10 fps, so it worked quite fine
creations-chat 2020-12-18 15:20:04 imagine 2014
creations-chat 2020-12-18 15:33:55 also pretty low effort imo

help 2020-12-31 10:51:48 no need to ask jay, was originally my way of doing it (note that miner did something somewhat similar before)
so basically u make them with control panels and propeller blades 
also, not seen on this, but u can also angle sections of control panels with motors
the control panels are connected with text blocks as they have no hitbox
its rather advanced and needs some motorlock, so only try if u feel confident

not to mention he called people toxic for downvoting his build just after he did mass downvote

creations-chat 2021-01-28 13:42:53 are u kinda dumb ???
do u seriously think having a better rank should get u more upvotes ?!
creations-chat 2021-01-28 13:48:19 people here aint 8yo my guy
standards are way higher, and its good like that
if all kind of pc content was in <#537387160261885962> , it would just be a spam of, well, trash content.
if u want to see ur content there and not being mass downvoted, u really gotta rise ur quality

if its a showcase there is no need to watch the vid if the build isnt good
creations-chat 2021-01-28 13:51:52 This is NOT a good looking blimp

not even close to 

no one is in the position to judge his own builds to that degree, and the community certainly didnt think like you

sorry for toxic but this guys way of thinking is pissing me off a bit
creations-chat 2021-01-28 13:56:41 if its being voted on for hof its still on voting

to be honest tho, quality of the build isnt that good, but maybe it has a chance bcs its "original" to people in vip gen
creations-chat 2021-01-28 14:00:14 its no bad build, but neither a extremely good one, no need to hype it that much

creations-chat 2021-05-20 14:02:24 its pretty dumb to argue about ranks, especially if u urself dont have decent ones. tbh nothing below expert designer does say anything about the skill of someone, and even expert designer could have been obtained with a meme build. and even then its still nothing more than boosting ur own ego to define skill by ranks. if u want to compare skill u could look at builds, but if the difference isnt too big it really just comes down to personal taste

also maybe stop to argue over such dumb things we already have 2min slowmode

<@!767079066997620767> either dont get in the argument in the first place or just leave it. if its important to u to continue (and that please on a mature level) feel free to use dms

bug-reports 2022-01-15 14:34:29 **Bug on Motor 1 speed configuration :**

certain speeds are set lower by a 0.01 increment if u try to configure them on a motor.
So far i found the following cases :

1.12 stays 1.12; 1.13 is set to 1.12; 1.14 is set to 1.13; 1.15 is set to 1.14; 1.16 is set to 1.15; 1.17 stays 1.17   
-> *a motor cant be configured to 1.16 speed*

0.56 stays 0.56; 0.57 is set to 0.56; 0.58 is set to 0.57; 0.59 stays 0.59 (video : https://streamable.com/u6iot9 )
-> *a motor cant be configured to 0.58 speed*

i also found that the motor speed is further set back by another 0.01 increment if the build is saved and then loaded :
for example, if a motor is configured to 0.58 speed, it gets set to 0.57 speed as explained above. When u now save the build and load it again, the motor has a speed configuration of 0.56
bug-reports 2022-01-15 14:55:24 i also found nothing in the dev console that seems even remotely related to that bug, forgot to say that
help 2022-01-15 19:01:07 once u submit something to hof, there is a vote in #vip-lounge where your build needs to get a score of 10 within 24 hours in order to get into hof. if the vote is successful, a mod or admin gives your build a star reaction wich makes the bot put the build into hof iirc

the-dump 2022-01-23 17:36:03 the water was dispensed into the jet stream wich aerosolized it, and by doing that it would effectively blow out oil well fires as if they were a candle

bot-central 2022-01-23 17:41:36 wow still
creations-chat 2022-01-27 12:14:18 *which makes total sense, bcs looking at the current contest for example, its clearly harder to get contest winner than a master rank* <:ElonSad:573361014112780303>
creations-chat 2022-01-27 12:51:21 idk if i understand correctly what u are trying to say, but my original statement was irony, contest winner is way easier to get provided you have enough time to play while the contest is going on
also there is no one with master supreme as of now, and for expert supreme u dont need anywhere near the skill level that is required to get hof or just contest winner, so expert supreme shouldnt get one into vip gen
creations-chat 2022-01-27 13:04:59 no problem with not understanding sarcasm, its hard to see through text sometimes 

also vip gen suggests the contest topics a lot of the time


anyway i argued over the "master rank should get vip gen access" thing with hyper quite a long time ago and if he didnt drastically change his opinion since then he still thinks master is easier to get than contest winner, so nothing will change about it anytime soon

creations-chat 2022-02-02 15:03:44 will delete post in a few hours am just bored
creations-chat 2022-02-02 15:16:02 what if i told u there was exposed motorlock on most hof builds (including mine)
creations-chat 2022-02-06 11:17:04 the intakes transition into the fuselage should be one continuous angle, the paintjob is kinda weird, the exhaust nozzle is a bit small and it would need a bit more detail like small decals, but if those points are addressed it may have a chance to get hof
creations-chat 2022-02-06 11:56:07 with the intake thing i meant the two bumps at the end of the wings, u should try to make it smoother there, and the exhaust nozzle i would make either very complicated like the one i created a few weeks ago or just make it straight and not with wedges
creations-chat 2022-02-08 16:09:56 intersting

bot-central 2022-12-10 15:04:04 cmon i dont wanna be alone in vip1 all the time
creations-chat 2022-12-11 19:43:25 it also should be tilted quite a bit towards the left hand side 
and i'd bring some slight gradients into the paintjob to simulate wear and shadows
creations-chat 2022-12-11 20:39:31 way too little then
creations-chat 2022-12-11 22:15:30 way too little then, i mean just look at it compared to yours
creations-chat 2022-12-13 18:46:05 what is wrong with you

creations-chat 2022-12-17 11:30:56 What in the world is wrong with you???

His build is 10 times better than the bland single color shit you build(and while you’re trying really hard to make your stuff look better with editing and shaders, lemme tell you something, the only thing that does is show that your build isn’t even good enough to stand on its own)

You’re downvoting his build out of pure spite because it shows you just how far your jet is from being good or let alone the best one out there. And then the reason you come up with to cover that fact is that he doesn’t have a good pc so you can see a few stupid pixels in his screenshot??

Just accept that you’re not as good as you’d like to be and stop trying to make others look worse you prick
creations-chat 2022-12-17 12:15:51 i never said the screenshots were good, i was saying they are the way they are bcs they are a bit cropped in on a screen with bad resolution
my point is that a shitty screenshot is maybe a reason to not upvote a build, but for sure isnt a reason to downvote one
the-dump 2022-12-18 19:33:06 bruh thats like one of the most famous photos ever taken, how do you not know it
