bug-reports 2018-10-07 13:57:37 i found a fix for the resetting
bug-reports 2018-10-07 14:08:06 weird
bug-reports 2018-10-07 14:08:08 check f9
bug-reports 2018-10-07 14:08:20 if it says (something) failed to load
bug-reports 2018-10-07 14:10:21 are you sure?
bug-reports 2018-10-07 14:10:27 on the wateR?
bug-reports 2018-10-07 14:10:33 what
bug-reports 2018-10-07 14:10:49 probably the old bug
bug-reports 2018-10-07 14:10:55 i dont know what causes that yet
bug-reports 2018-10-07 14:11:03 i think probably because it fails to save
bug-reports 2018-10-07 14:26:43 yeah thats with some colors
bug-reports 2018-10-07 14:26:57 the colors save with color codes
bug-reports 2018-10-07 14:27:19 if you want them to save as their original
bug-reports 2018-10-07 14:27:25 check if its correct https://www.robloxdev.com/articles/BrickColor-Codes
bug-reports 2018-10-07 14:27:32 or use the easycolor box
bug-reports 2018-10-07 14:28:32 it does
bug-reports 2018-10-07 14:28:53 but
bug-reports 2018-10-07 14:29:05 it grabs the color code which is the closest to the rgb unit
bug-reports 2018-10-07 14:30:18 i can change the rgb to color codes if you want to
bug-reports 2018-10-07 14:42:17 ?
bug-reports 2018-10-07 14:42:22 like how?
bug-reports 2018-10-07 14:43:08 oh i see
bug-reports 2018-10-07 16:24:39 ?
bug-reports 2018-10-07 16:24:45 press f9 what do you see
bug-reports 2018-10-07 16:29:18 its probably a rare bug
bug-reports 2018-10-07 16:29:34 my version is different as of right now (fixed version)
bug-reports 2018-10-07 16:38:31 yeah thats because it saves with color codes
bug-reports 2018-10-07 16:38:50 it picks the closest colorcode which is sometimes causing the color to be slightly different
bug-reports 2018-10-07 16:39:19 check if the rgb matches the color codes if you want it to save properly https://www.robloxdev.com/articles/BrickColor-Codes
bug-reports 2018-10-07 16:41:59 idk
bug-reports 2018-10-07 16:42:42 they have done that with hexes
bug-reports 2018-10-07 16:42:48 but thats longer than rgb
bug-reports 2018-10-07 16:43:00 which grabs more data
bug-reports 2018-10-07 16:47:23 yeah but
bug-reports 2018-10-07 16:47:30 its cooler when you can paint every single part
bug-reports 2018-10-07 16:55:21 creating my own color codes?
bug-reports 2018-10-07 16:55:40 good idea
bug-reports 2018-10-07 16:55:52 i'll look into it for the next update
bug-reports 2018-10-07 18:05:25 <@!295568493166985218> check announcements
bug-reports 2018-10-07 18:25:51 they are faster

bug-reports 2018-10-11 08:15:35 Im going to look at it
bug-reports 2018-10-11 20:45:23 yeah its really weird i think this happened because roblox got updated

help 2018-10-14 12:34:07 im working on a fix for that
help 2018-10-14 12:34:14 <@!260797229068058634> O_o
help 2018-10-14 12:34:19 no thats not good at all xd
help 2018-10-14 12:34:33 its large when the script timesout
bug-reports 2018-10-14 13:45:58 it timed out already
bug-reports 2018-10-14 13:50:59 i've removed the 75k lines script from saving
bug-reports 2018-10-14 13:51:06 and fixed the rotation part
bug-reports 2018-10-14 13:51:18 it still loads
bug-reports 2018-10-14 13:51:22 but doesnt save
bug-reports 2018-10-14 13:53:11 its really hard to see some bugs
bug-reports 2018-10-14 13:53:17 when im testing in my testing place
bug-reports 2018-10-14 13:53:39 the paint was just pure luck i didnt check the jet engines at the final change
bug-reports 2018-10-14 13:54:05 and the lag from the position converter could only be seen with multiple people playing on the test place
bug-reports 2018-10-14 13:58:54 deleta aircraft?
bug-reports 2018-10-14 13:58:57 show f9
bug-reports 2018-10-14 13:59:04 oh

bug-reports 2018-10-14 14:11:31 i can revert the paint though
bug-reports 2018-10-14 14:21:05 how do i cheer it up
bug-reports 2018-10-14 14:21:41 thats the real question
bug-reports 2018-10-14 14:32:02 there are some airports which do not have these boarding gates
bug-reports 2018-10-14 14:32:11 but stairs and busses only
bug-reports 2018-10-14 15:36:08 is this in the new server?
bug-reports 2018-10-14 18:55:27 yeah theres sometime of lag i've heard
bug-reports 2018-10-14 18:55:33 im looking at it
bug-reports 2018-10-14 19:29:39 join a newer server
bug-reports 2018-10-14 20:00:45 try joining the vip server
bug-reports 2018-10-14 20:00:54 look in the <#501059272675688468>
bug-reports 2018-10-14 20:01:19 then the public is still the old version
bug-reports 2018-10-14 20:01:38 you're not capable of loading on older servers
bug-reports 2018-10-14 20:01:53 because it saved in a new way which the old server doesnt support
bug-reports 2018-10-14 20:02:17 retry
bug-reports 2018-10-14 20:23:10 Respawn the craft
bug-reports 2018-10-14 21:23:11 Press f9 tell me what you see
bug-reports 2018-10-14 21:23:29 <@456226577798135808>
bug-reports 2018-10-14 22:00:31 That isnt anything bad
bug-reports 2018-10-14 22:00:46 You should keep on trying or rejoin
bug-reports 2018-10-14 22:02:25 No you wont
bug-reports 2018-10-14 22:02:35 Check announcements
bug-reports 2018-10-15 12:04:45 <@!313403326081531914> you were in an old server try to find a new server
bug-reports 2018-10-15 12:06:55 too late
bug-reports 2018-10-15 12:07:03 you can notice it by saving the paint
bug-reports 2018-10-15 12:07:05 on a jet engine
bug-reports 2018-10-15 12:07:18 and then reloading it
bug-reports 2018-10-15 12:07:20 yeah good idea
bug-reports 2018-10-15 12:43:18 are there any bugs found yet?
bug-reports 2018-10-15 12:51:54 im working on it
bug-reports 2018-10-15 12:52:11 it was working in studio the last time i tested it but somehow broke
bug-reports 2018-10-15 15:17:43 are you sure?
bug-reports 2018-10-15 15:17:44 no lag at all?
bug-reports 2018-10-15 15:17:54 does the welding work?
bug-reports 2018-10-15 15:30:24 yeah i know
bug-reports 2018-10-15 22:15:43 There is a bug with the large jet engine somehow
bug-reports 2018-10-16 06:51:25 <@!298214157533184002> i have no idea why this happens try using blocks and place them via the sides
bug-reports 2018-10-16 15:53:38 i have no idea why that occurs but it was already pretty hard to add these type of long items
the-dump 2018-10-17 08:28:57 https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/410649431093018626/501985275019395083/image0.jpg
bug-reports 2018-10-17 17:27:05 whats wrong with that
bug-reports 2018-10-18 15:40:28 its almost impossible to create that
bug-reports 2018-10-18 15:40:46 yeah
bug-reports 2018-10-18 15:41:35 if i was going to make it it would either lag a lot or be extremely difficult to create it
bug-reports 2018-10-18 15:41:51 since creating loads of rays lags
bug-reports 2018-10-18 17:03:43 those are roblox issues i think
bug-reports 2018-10-18 17:04:09 or because of wireless wifi
bug-reports 2018-10-19 21:20:57 you can paint all of them
bug-reports 2018-10-19 21:21:03 but only from the bottom and the back side

bug-reports 2018-10-22 20:57:05 weird
bug-reports 2018-10-22 20:57:18 this probably means arena might corrupt your saveslot
bug-reports 2018-10-22 20:57:22 O_o
bug-reports 2018-10-22 20:57:34 i've got to update this version as soon as possible
bug-reports 2018-10-22 22:14:34 its because the paint is saved with brickcolor codes
bug-reports 2018-10-23 22:18:47 the blocks are saved with brickcolor codes
bug-reports 2018-10-23 22:19:26 which might sometimes be a bit different than custom colors
bug-reports 2018-10-24 11:09:32 <@!295568493166985218> what color were your jet engines
bug-reports 2018-10-24 19:13:46 <@!327499289595084800> is that your creation

bug-reports 2018-10-25 18:17:03 i'll look into it
bug-reports 2018-10-25 22:20:56 yes i know
bug-reports 2018-10-26 12:11:53 that could be possible
bug-reports 2018-10-26 12:13:06 ^ that could be possible too
bug-reports 2018-10-26 20:44:46 ik
bug-reports 2018-10-27 13:34:15 <@!260797229068058634> try rotating the motor once

bug-reports 2018-10-28 09:10:04 Show f9
bug-reports 2018-10-28 12:54:33 such as?
bug-reports 2018-10-28 13:47:10 wait
bug-reports 2018-10-28 13:47:17 it is still possible
bug-reports 2018-10-28 13:47:30 because someone jumped into your main seat
bug-reports 2018-10-28 13:48:06 <@!340543153922768906> are there huge spaces between buttons in your game?
bug-reports 2018-10-28 13:48:22 the wheels are kinda glitchy
bug-reports 2018-10-28 13:48:46 grab
bug-reports 2018-10-28 13:48:51 check the save and load gui
bug-reports 2018-10-28 13:48:58 are there huge spaces?
bug-reports 2018-10-28 13:49:33 <@!340543153922768906> do you see the autosave slot in the save and load gui?
bug-reports 2018-10-28 13:49:48 <@456226577798135808> this happens because the game thinks the wheels are a fully sized block
bug-reports 2018-10-28 13:50:13 <@!340543153922768906> join a newer server where there are no huge spaces between buttons and you are capable of seeing the autosave slot
bug-reports 2018-10-28 13:50:17 its fixed in there
bug-reports 2018-10-28 13:51:11 <@456226577798135808> dont place any blocks around the part where the wheel is attached to
bug-reports 2018-10-28 13:51:25 <@!340543153922768906> that would cause lots of people to lose their saves
bug-reports 2018-10-28 13:51:54 eh
bug-reports 2018-10-28 13:52:02 i think it is by rewriting the whole game
bug-reports 2018-10-28 13:52:09 i will be looking into it
bug-reports 2018-10-28 13:52:15 but im not sure if its going to be fixed
bug-reports 2018-10-28 13:52:24 theserious
bug-reports 2018-10-28 13:52:40 just dont place any blocks around the 1 part where the wheel is attached to
bug-reports 2018-10-28 13:53:23 i'll be looking for a solution so maybe in the future it will work
bug-reports 2018-10-28 15:32:10 ?
bug-reports 2018-10-28 15:33:07 like what button
bug-reports 2018-10-28 15:33:15 the one on the bottom right?
bug-reports 2018-10-28 18:28:51 yeah but it wont affect them
bug-reports 2018-10-29 22:33:36 screenshot pls
bug-reports 2018-10-29 22:35:17 <@!298214157533184002>
bug-reports 2018-10-29 22:53:10 how did you place them
bug-reports 2018-10-29 23:09:24 wheels are kinda glitchy
bug-reports 2018-10-29 23:09:53 the parts fall off because of the wheels
bug-reports 2018-10-30 08:03:06 Thats to decrease lag
bug-reports 2018-10-30 22:02:44 Press f9 what does it say
bug-reports 2018-10-31 07:25:37 I have no idea why it occurs
bug-reports 2018-10-31 14:51:14 the wheels are the reason why it happens since the welding works with fully sized blocks only
bug-reports 2018-11-01 09:26:25 You can disable autosave in the settings
bug-reports 2018-11-01 13:09:52 Some weird thing happens with saving these items i will look into it
creations-chat 2018-11-01 14:46:44 ask someone else please
bug-reports 2018-11-01 15:50:48 yeah this will be fixed within the next update check <#490306593242611742>
the-dump 2018-11-01 18:27:34 https://gyazo.com/519feecf3b2a2f1589ae8996fa46bc5b.gif
bug-reports 2018-11-01 19:49:42 eh
bug-reports 2018-11-01 19:49:49 im not sure about the shaking part
bug-reports 2018-11-01 19:50:19 yeah i know what you're talking about
bug-reports 2018-11-01 19:50:25 but its because of the roblox physics
bug-reports 2018-11-01 21:12:01 some weird bug and i have no idea why that happens
bug-reports 2018-11-02 06:21:47 Build blocks to the side and place it there
bug-reports 2018-11-02 18:43:12 this is already fixed in the update coming <:Soon:501066468629413916>
bug-reports 2018-11-02 18:47:07 i'll give the link once i have to test some stuff
bug-reports 2018-11-02 20:27:47 ?
bug-reports 2018-11-02 20:41:23 yeah but it wont work
bug-reports 2018-11-02 20:41:33 it shows it passed the limit
bug-reports 2018-11-02 20:41:52 but when you launch your creation the game handles it like its 2
bug-reports 2018-11-02 20:41:53 instead of 10
bug-reports 2018-11-02 21:33:38 wheels are weld in a weird way
bug-reports 2018-11-02 21:33:44 dont place anything ontop of the wheel
bug-reports 2018-11-03 10:30:59 I need to see the server sided logs
bug-reports 2018-11-03 10:31:09 But only mad has acces to those
bug-reports 2018-11-03 14:10:35 Maybe there is
bug-reports 2018-11-03 14:11:01 Because if the blocks still show up it might be an issue with the loader
bug-reports 2018-11-03 14:11:33 But i would need it to show up in my test server or i would need to see the server logs in plane crazy
bug-reports 2018-11-03 16:44:44 ?
bug-reports 2018-11-03 16:45:03 oh wait what
bug-reports 2018-11-03 16:45:08 saving in flight mode?
bug-reports 2018-11-03 16:45:23 how is that possible
bug-reports 2018-11-03 16:45:53 i dont see it
bug-reports 2018-11-03 16:47:32 i've fixed it in my game
bug-reports 2018-11-03 16:47:41 if the save and load gui ever happens to popup in flightmode
bug-reports 2018-11-03 16:47:45 it wont overwrite it
bug-reports 2018-11-03 16:48:34 i mean
bug-reports 2018-11-03 16:48:45 i will be fixing it
bug-reports 2018-11-03 16:50:15 nope
bug-reports 2018-11-03 17:39:22 yes
bug-reports 2018-11-03 17:39:27 i've shutdown the server
bug-reports 2018-11-03 17:39:28 lol

the-dump 2018-11-04 15:17:15 https://gyazo.com/9840a8706ddcf93f09b32389a4a9bcc2
bug-reports 2018-11-04 21:45:59 <@!226479230710579200> that happens because the wheels have sweet spots where it doesnt weld the blocks
bug-reports 2018-11-05 18:19:10 ?
bug-reports 2018-11-05 18:36:28 i know
bug-reports 2018-11-05 18:36:30 im working on it
bug-reports 2018-11-05 18:36:33 thats why its broken
bug-reports 2018-11-08 18:59:19 it will be fixed within the next update
bug-reports 2018-11-08 21:35:10 the bug was
bug-reports 2018-11-08 21:35:30 that the datastore wasnt there on the maingame
bug-reports 2018-11-08 21:36:17 i've made it that once the game gets updated a message pops up telling you the game got updated
bug-reports 2018-11-08 21:36:37 but it uses the datastore to check if the game got update but since it wasnt there yet in the maingame it broke the whole script
bug-reports 2018-11-08 21:36:59 <@!226479230710579200>
bug-reports 2018-11-08 22:09:00 show video pls

bug-reports 2018-11-09 14:12:22 those bugs are really difficult to fix
bug-reports 2018-11-09 14:12:27 about the beams
bug-reports 2018-11-09 14:12:44 just place a temporarly beam on the side
bug-reports 2018-11-09 14:12:47 and place a beam on there

the-dump 2018-11-09 21:18:59 https://youtu.be/8nGcWFRwhOM
bug-reports 2018-11-10 00:52:57 its fixed once the game gets updated its a matter of time
bug-reports 2018-11-10 01:01:00 <@456226577798135808> how did the corrupt
bug-reports 2018-11-10 10:42:18 If its turned off it also attracts motors
the-dump 2018-11-10 10:51:24 https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/510638011004747804/510638039538597889/2m6fzj.jpg
bug-reports 2018-11-10 12:09:49 because when lose parts only is not selected it grabs all the connected parts and the motor isnt supported by :Getconnectedparts
bug-reports 2018-11-10 12:09:58 thats why it attracts the motors
bug-reports 2018-11-10 12:28:37 <@!238825322508845056> i've made some changes to the wheels im not sure if its fixed but it looks like it is for me
bug-reports 2018-11-10 13:49:51 ?

bug-reports 2018-11-10 14:18:23 rejoin?
bug-reports 2018-11-10 14:18:35 check for anchoredblocks?
bug-reports 2018-11-10 14:18:51 i've made an update to anchoredblocks
bug-reports 2018-11-10 14:18:58 your creation stays frozen when you spawn in
bug-reports 2018-11-10 14:19:02 unless you press the key for it
bug-reports 2018-11-10 14:19:32 i need to know how it occured otherwise i cant do anything
bug-reports 2018-11-10 14:19:55 i dont see any issues on the newer servers
bug-reports 2018-11-10 14:21:57 im checking it
bug-reports 2018-11-10 14:23:22 yes join the vip server
bug-reports 2018-11-10 14:23:26 i just tested
bug-reports 2018-11-10 14:23:28 it works in there
bug-reports 2018-11-10 14:23:33 <#501059272675688468>
bug-reports 2018-11-10 14:23:35 any
bug-reports 2018-11-10 14:30:02 does it fall to the ground though?
bug-reports 2018-11-10 14:30:54 hm
bug-reports 2018-11-10 14:31:01 it probably doesnt unanchor it somehow
bug-reports 2018-11-10 14:31:27 did you try it in a new vip server?
bug-reports 2018-11-10 14:32:35 there are 3 possibilities
bug-reports 2018-11-10 14:32:46 or the save file might be corrupted
bug-reports 2018-11-10 14:33:00 or the unanchoring script is broken
bug-reports 2018-11-10 14:33:11 or theres an anchored block somewhere hidden in your creation
bug-reports 2018-11-10 14:33:16 yeah
bug-reports 2018-11-10 14:33:35 but if something is corrupted doesnt mean it cant load
bug-reports 2018-11-10 14:33:45 try replacing some blocks
bug-reports 2018-11-10 14:34:06 i've had that a long time ago that some items didnt load or something
bug-reports 2018-11-10 14:34:28 no
bug-reports 2018-11-10 14:34:29 it wouldnt
bug-reports 2018-11-10 14:34:35 i've made a change to anchored blocks
bug-reports 2018-11-10 14:34:44 they fall once you press the key
bug-reports 2018-11-10 14:35:05 the key assigned to the anchored block
bug-reports 2018-11-10 14:35:20 idk
bug-reports 2018-11-10 14:35:47 go over every single block with the purple tool
bug-reports 2018-11-10 14:35:53 and find the anchored block
bug-reports 2018-11-10 14:36:10 see
bug-reports 2018-11-10 14:36:12 no issues
bug-reports 2018-11-10 15:35:25 is it arena only

bug-reports 2018-11-18 15:30:28 or is it fine?
bug-reports 2018-11-18 15:31:00 like?..
bug-reports 2018-11-18 15:34:04 yeah i've increased the friction a lot
bug-reports 2018-11-18 15:34:16 like the wheel had absolutely no weight
bug-reports 2018-11-18 15:34:26 thats why it started bouncing
bug-reports 2018-11-18 15:34:38 so i gave it a lot of weight
bug-reports 2018-11-18 15:35:04 which probably also increased the friction
bug-reports 2018-11-18 15:35:21 is it too much weight?
bug-reports 2018-11-18 15:35:33 i was planning to add even more weight

bug-reports 2018-11-30 22:06:01 have you still not returned?
bug-reports 2018-11-30 23:09:17 ?
bug-reports 2018-11-30 23:09:23 didn't cause any issues for me
bug-reports 2018-11-30 23:51:03 i need to know why it happens because i cant get it to break
bug-reports 2018-11-30 23:51:12 i think its roblox physics
bug-reports 2018-11-30 23:51:25 lights are kinda annoying as usual in roblox
bug-reports 2018-12-01 00:18:43 there are currently 2 servers
bug-reports 2018-12-01 00:18:46 which still kick you
bug-reports 2018-12-01 00:19:15 yeah
bug-reports 2018-12-01 00:19:18 dont use the play button
bug-reports 2018-12-01 00:19:22 join larger servers manually
bug-reports 2018-12-01 00:19:35 the game wont shutdown
bug-reports 2018-12-01 00:19:38 so it keeps kicking
bug-reports 2018-12-01 00:20:21 its because its waiting 1 second
bug-reports 2018-12-01 00:20:24 before it shutsdown
bug-reports 2018-12-01 00:20:28 so people can save etc
bug-reports 2018-12-01 00:20:34 but within that single second
bug-reports 2018-12-01 00:20:37 a new player joins the game
bug-reports 2018-12-01 00:20:47 and it has to wait for him to leave and then wait one more second again
bug-reports 2018-12-01 00:20:51 and keeps going on and on
bug-reports 2018-12-01 00:21:10 xd
bug-reports 2018-12-01 00:24:06 there is still a server left woah https://gyazo.com/03618fcf3977e94d62a71fb37ecbd916
bug-reports 2018-12-01 00:48:11 Was it when the game was being shut down?
bug-reports 2018-12-01 00:48:30 Yes
bug-reports 2018-12-01 00:48:32 We know
bug-reports 2018-12-01 00:48:36 Were working on it
bug-reports 2018-12-01 00:48:44 We dont have all the time
bug-reports 2018-12-01 00:48:57 I am already working 24/7 on the game
bug-reports 2018-12-01 00:49:17 And madattak has a full time job + artic facillity
bug-reports 2018-12-01 00:49:38 His main game
bug-reports 2018-12-01 00:49:44 Which he works on
bug-reports 2018-12-01 00:49:59 Plane crazy was actually a small project
bug-reports 2018-12-01 00:50:09 Made quickly for fun
bug-reports 2018-12-01 00:50:23 Idk
bug-reports 2018-12-01 00:50:36 Are you good at it?
bug-reports 2018-12-01 00:50:54 Give examples
bug-reports 2018-12-01 00:51:45 Idk
bug-reports 2018-12-01 00:52:45 I dont know if it would be a good thing
bug-reports 2018-12-01 00:53:11 Because if i dont want to add it or the most of the people dont like it it wont be added
bug-reports 2018-12-01 00:53:30 And then everything was a waste of time
bug-reports 2018-12-01 00:54:01 Then go ahead
bug-reports 2018-12-01 00:54:27 Please add playgrounds an ocean etc
bug-reports 2018-12-01 00:54:40 Lots of grasslands
bug-reports 2018-12-01 00:54:53 Also add some terrain please
bug-reports 2018-12-01 00:55:09 And an airport
bug-reports 2018-12-01 00:55:26 I can also send you the current airport if you want to
bug-reports 2018-12-01 01:02:09 however
bug-reports 2018-12-01 01:02:11 its planned
bug-reports 2018-12-01 01:02:16 for later though
bug-reports 2018-12-01 01:02:47 im not thinking about it as of right now because theres a lot more stuff to do
bug-reports 2018-12-01 01:03:49 ?
bug-reports 2018-12-01 01:03:54 oh
bug-reports 2018-12-01 01:04:04 i've added that so you can see how much data is being used
bug-reports 2018-12-01 01:04:44 because there are some people that have a lot of creations and since roblox has a limit to saving data their builds dont save when it goes over the limit
bug-reports 2018-12-01 01:05:28 so you can see if it goes over it and if its over the limit and you leave the game everything wont save and it will keep the old save files
bug-reports 2018-12-01 01:06:33 could be a bug
bug-reports 2018-12-01 01:06:36 though
bug-reports 2018-12-01 01:06:57 but i dont know what would be causing it maybe the shutdown caused it im not sure though
bug-reports 2018-12-01 01:07:46 i will work on it for you
bug-reports 2018-12-01 01:09:36 gimballing?
bug-reports 2018-12-01 01:09:42 what
bug-reports 2018-12-01 01:13:07 ...
bug-reports 2018-12-01 01:13:11 eh
bug-reports 2018-12-01 01:13:30 rotating engines?
bug-reports 2018-12-01 01:13:49 cant you place an engine on a motor?
bug-reports 2018-12-01 01:27:57 <:ping:508027985190715457>
bug-reports 2018-12-01 01:35:23 what wheels does it have
bug-reports 2018-12-01 02:08:37 and when do you reset
bug-reports 2018-12-01 02:08:39 in flight mode?
bug-reports 2018-12-01 02:08:43 or when you're building
bug-reports 2018-12-01 02:08:46 <@!304253531886583808>
bug-reports 2018-12-01 02:12:13 can you reset for me <@!304253531886583808>
bug-reports 2018-12-01 02:12:18 and see if an update message pops up
bug-reports 2018-12-01 02:22:06 🤦
bug-reports 2018-12-01 02:22:11 i know why its happening
bug-reports 2018-12-01 02:22:15 once you reset
bug-reports 2018-12-01 02:22:32 it clones an extra save/load
bug-reports 2018-12-01 02:22:39 so you actually have 2
bug-reports 2018-12-01 02:22:43 and it removes 1
bug-reports 2018-12-01 02:22:51 and keeps on waiting for it to go away
bug-reports 2018-12-01 10:42:21 Search for something else than exhausted
bug-reports 2018-12-01 12:51:30 Nothing else?
bug-reports 2018-12-01 15:24:41 replace them
bug-reports 2018-12-01 15:24:43 and dont rotate
bug-reports 2018-12-01 15:24:56 or change the keys until all of them move in the same way
bug-reports 2018-12-01 15:49:09 yeah thats normal

bug-reports 2018-12-02 12:42:05 yes
bug-reports 2018-12-02 12:42:09 thats because of the roblox physics

bug-reports 2018-12-02 12:42:31 or
bug-reports 2018-12-02 12:42:31 and then everything wont move
bug-reports 2018-12-02 12:42:34 it either throttles
bug-reports 2018-12-02 12:42:42 and causes your stuff to get flung because of the collision

bug-reports 2018-12-02 12:44:54 that means that those were sleeping
bug-reports 2018-12-02 12:45:18 but i sadly can't change the settings of the physics
bug-reports 2018-12-02 12:45:29 i really hope roblox will add it somewhere in the future
bug-reports 2018-12-02 12:45:37 for the client
bug-reports 2018-12-02 12:45:48 because they dont want it on the server since it stresses the server a lot
creations-chat 2018-12-02 13:04:48 how does this work
creations-chat 2018-12-02 13:04:52 do i just post a picture
creations-chat 2018-12-02 13:04:54 ?
bug-reports 2018-12-02 14:06:26 i will look into it
bug-reports 2018-12-02 14:24:50 what painting bug
bug-reports 2018-12-02 14:25:16 <@!351933959585660940>
bug-reports 2018-12-02 14:26:00 yes
bug-reports 2018-12-02 14:27:15 what
bug-reports 2018-12-02 14:27:36 thats impossible
bug-reports 2018-12-02 14:28:47 yes
bug-reports 2018-12-02 14:28:52 if you save different colours
bug-reports 2018-12-02 14:28:58 it might be possible that it takes more data
bug-reports 2018-12-02 14:29:04 because the numbers could be different
bug-reports 2018-12-02 14:29:11 as an example 170,0,0
bug-reports 2018-12-02 14:29:20 takes 7 spots
bug-reports 2018-12-02 14:29:28 while 0,0,0 takes 5 spots
bug-reports 2018-12-02 14:29:40 and if you have 255,255,255
bug-reports 2018-12-02 14:29:46 it takes 11 spots
bug-reports 2018-12-02 14:29:52 which means more data to save
bug-reports 2018-12-02 14:29:58 <@!351933959585660940>
bug-reports 2018-12-02 14:30:18 yes i know
bug-reports 2018-12-02 14:30:24 im still waiting for mad to publish the fix
bug-reports 2018-12-02 14:32:27 yes
bug-reports 2018-12-02 14:32:29 its possible
bug-reports 2018-12-02 14:32:37 disable the saveRGB option
bug-reports 2018-12-02 14:32:41 and resave all your slots
bug-reports 2018-12-02 14:32:58 well then its impossible
bug-reports 2018-12-02 14:33:05 get an alt?
bug-reports 2018-12-02 14:41:34 when you disable this option the blocks will save via brickcolor codes
bug-reports 2018-12-02 14:41:52 which might be different than the colour you used
bug-reports 2018-12-02 14:41:56 but it saves a lot more data
bug-reports 2018-12-02 14:42:06 since instead of 11 digits it saves only 4
bug-reports 2018-12-02 14:42:19 thats 7 digits less
bug-reports 2018-12-02 14:42:24 which means a lot more save data
bug-reports 2018-12-02 14:43:00 also it might even be less than 4 digits since the codes could be from 1 to 1000
bug-reports 2018-12-02 14:48:55 it is possible
bug-reports 2018-12-02 14:49:04 but it would take 5 minutes to save or load
bug-reports 2018-12-02 14:49:09 i had already tried it
bug-reports 2018-12-02 14:49:27 and also if you tried saving large creations the script would error
bug-reports 2018-12-02 14:49:34 because of the 70k lines
bug-reports 2018-12-02 14:49:45 its impossible
bug-reports 2018-12-02 16:25:50 np 😃
bug-reports 2018-12-02 17:09:14 thank you for telling me this
bug-reports 2018-12-02 17:15:53 <@314383347214319616> https://gyazo.com/944beba90e8e8320de1b756b1af46b68

bug-reports 2018-12-02 23:41:25 thats because of the roblox physics
bug-reports 2018-12-02 23:41:31 yes
bug-reports 2018-12-02 23:41:35 thats roblox physics
bug-reports 2018-12-03 06:30:23 I will look into it but i think its the roblox physics in sleep mode
bug-reports 2018-12-03 14:27:45 <@!503464415254020096>

bug-reports 2018-12-03 15:11:08 they weld to the bottom
bug-reports 2018-12-03 15:11:19 no

bug-reports 2018-12-03 15:15:28 <@!227465821947953152> https://gyazo.com/827e8109e99340e4c5ccd0297996cc30.gif
bug-reports 2018-12-03 15:15:38 place it like that
bug-reports 2018-12-03 15:33:04 then it should work
bug-reports 2018-12-03 16:58:50 fixed within the next update
bug-reports 2018-12-03 17:05:45 yes
bug-reports 2018-12-03 17:05:50 it will be fixed within the next update
bug-reports 2018-12-03 17:05:56 i have found out why it glitches out
bug-reports 2018-12-03 17:06:13 whenever madattak updates the game
bug-reports 2018-12-03 17:06:27 but it will be a silent update though
bug-reports 2018-12-03 17:06:45 because people have been complaining about the daily updates
bug-reports 2018-12-03 17:08:52 yeah
bug-reports 2018-12-03 17:08:55 i will keep on updating
bug-reports 2018-12-03 17:08:57 but not daily
bug-reports 2018-12-03 17:09:02 like once every 3 days or week
bug-reports 2018-12-03 17:16:31 ?
bug-reports 2018-12-03 20:49:14 then it should be the roblox physics
bug-reports 2018-12-04 06:54:17 Roblox physics
bug-reports 2018-12-04 16:57:04 i cant do anything about the roblox physics i can check once more for you guys but theres nothing much i can do 😦
bug-reports 2018-12-05 06:37:43 Dont send logs of exhuasted events those are something else

bug-reports 2018-12-06 19:30:29 it freezes for a split second
bug-reports 2018-12-06 19:30:34 after that it should work fine
bug-reports 2018-12-06 19:30:39 it depends on how many parts you use

bug-reports 2019-04-25 11:24:26 <@456226577798135808> thats because of the roblox physics
bug-reports 2019-04-25 11:24:49 The more it has to process = the more your creation shakes
bug-reports 2019-04-25 11:25:52 <@456226577798135808> slow down the speed of the ropes
bug-reports 2019-04-25 11:25:56 That should help
bug-reports 2019-04-25 11:26:14 And make sure its unanchored
bug-reports 2019-04-25 11:26:25 So you know when to stop whenever it starts to shake
bug-reports 2019-04-25 13:57:24 I will take a look at it

bug-reports 2019-12-03 10:17:09 no
bug-reports 2019-12-03 10:17:19 everything has to go through the roblox chat filter
bug-reports 2019-12-03 10:17:22 or the game will get banned
bug-reports 2019-12-03 10:17:30 yes
bug-reports 2019-12-03 10:17:38 yes because i am forced to
bug-reports 2019-12-03 10:17:50 yes thats for the custom signs
bug-reports 2019-12-03 10:17:53 spelling
bug-reports 2019-12-03 10:17:55 it uses both
bug-reports 2019-12-03 10:19:11 if roblox finds out that the game does not use the roblox chat filter, the game will get taken down.
and i have added another filter ontop of the roblox chat filter to make signs spell proof
bug-reports 2019-12-03 10:19:22 numbers is just roblox
bug-reports 2019-12-03 10:19:25 not my fault

bug-reports 2019-12-04 09:29:35 its probably roblox with a new update
bug-reports 2019-12-04 09:29:48 <@456226577798135808> add anchor blocks
bug-reports 2019-12-04 09:30:31 if 2 blocks are pushed into eachother it will cause a lot of lag
bug-reports 2019-12-04 09:31:11 wait
bug-reports 2019-12-04 09:31:17 are those cylinders yours?
bug-reports 2019-12-04 09:31:36 dont use disconnectors
bug-reports 2019-12-04 09:31:59 no i have made it that the conveyors dont push connected parts
bug-reports 2019-12-04 09:32:05 if you use a disconnector
bug-reports 2019-12-04 09:32:09 it counts as a connected part
bug-reports 2019-12-04 09:32:25 but it doesn't recheck because that causes a lot of lag
bug-reports 2019-12-04 09:32:48 ?

bug-reports 2020-04-14 13:00:42 you guys are confusing
bug-reports 2020-04-14 13:01:53 so i make a camera
bug-reports 2020-04-14 13:01:55 set it to 1
bug-reports 2020-04-14 13:01:57 press 1
bug-reports 2020-04-14 13:01:59 and press 1 again
bug-reports 2020-04-14 13:02:01 ??
bug-reports 2020-04-14 13:04:11 so this is a feature request?
bug-reports 2020-04-14 13:04:16 <#507673335816126509>
bug-reports 2020-04-14 13:05:14 o
bug-reports 2020-04-14 13:05:16 i have noticed it now
bug-reports 2020-04-14 13:05:18 no listen
bug-reports 2020-04-14 13:05:38 i had made it so that your camera toggles once when you have controls set to auto for noob players
bug-reports 2020-04-14 13:05:49 but that caused an issue with the cameras apparantly
bug-reports 2020-04-14 13:06:01 because it litterally just toggles once like you press c on your keyboard
bug-reports 2020-04-14 13:06:35 also noticed an issue with the config
bug-reports 2020-04-14 13:10:44 im working on it
bug-reports 2020-04-14 13:10:51 i didn't expect this to happen
bug-reports 2020-04-14 13:11:02 i though the camera would start to roll in after 3 times of toggling
bug-reports 2020-04-14 13:21:37 roblox physics

bug-reports 2020-04-15 15:38:08 does it appear on the PVP server though?
bug-reports 2020-04-16 09:00:54 <@!557172100545249281> the server has to catch up
bug-reports 2020-04-16 09:01:18 i have made some improvements to the bandwidth
bug-reports 2020-04-16 09:01:49 and the timehandler now only starts working once you have it enabled
bug-reports 2020-04-16 09:01:56 so it takes a while for you to catch up
bug-reports 2020-04-16 09:07:07 it works fine

bug-reports 2020-05-17 18:09:00 its because you join too quickly
bug-reports 2020-05-17 18:09:20 i suggest leaving the game first for now

bug-reports 2021-01-15 16:28:05 i could contact roblox and show them the cause and possibly fix it for everyone

the-dump 2021-01-24 23:16:20 wow
bug-reports 2021-01-25 00:24:32 is the motor issue resolved?
bug-reports 2021-01-25 00:24:40 im not sure whats going on as i have no issues with my motors
bug-reports 2021-01-25 02:24:31 roblox did make some changes to servo's
bug-reports 2021-01-25 02:24:40 but i didn't notice any issues myself before
bug-reports 2021-01-25 02:29:11 can you guys send a screenshot of a small setup that makes this issue happen?
bug-reports 2021-01-25 02:31:04 im able to get it to happen for like 1/2 seconds
bug-reports 2021-01-25 02:31:07 and then it goes away
bug-reports 2021-01-25 02:31:11 i think its because of the lag
bug-reports 2021-01-25 02:31:26 they might have changed some type of updating mechanic
bug-reports 2021-01-25 02:31:30 and made it update slower
bug-reports 2021-01-25 02:31:45 which means its more difficult for my servo script to detect whenever it reached the target
bug-reports 2021-01-25 02:35:08 i noticed a massive mistake in the motor2 script
bug-reports 2021-01-25 02:35:19 for some reason something really important was missing from the script
bug-reports 2021-01-25 02:42:35 a local had disappeared for some reason
bug-reports 2021-01-25 02:42:39 really strange
bug-reports 2021-01-25 02:42:51 and i have also increased the sensitivity
bug-reports 2021-01-25 02:45:15 for the people who were experiencing the issues with the servo mode, check newer servers

bug-reports 2021-03-02 10:30:59 no issues
bug-reports 2021-03-02 10:31:12 do your building blocks save though
bug-reports 2021-03-02 10:31:20 like if you build something
bug-reports 2021-03-02 10:31:23 does it get saved
bug-reports 2021-03-02 10:31:46 is there anything you do to make this happen?
bug-reports 2021-03-02 10:31:52 like what do you exactly do
bug-reports 2021-03-02 10:31:54 in the game
bug-reports 2021-03-02 10:35:07 
bug-reports 2021-03-02 10:35:11 checked in studio with your savedata
bug-reports 2021-03-02 10:35:15 it worked in there
bug-reports 2021-03-02 10:35:28 like i just joined
bug-reports 2021-03-02 10:35:34 and it showed up
bug-reports 2021-03-02 10:36:04 https://www.roblox.com/games/166986752/Plane-Crazy?privateServerLinkCode=cF61H4MQAgsFFg7GO3jBm53SFf8WbiZK

bug-reports 2021-03-02 10:36:10 try joining here?
bug-reports 2021-03-02 10:37:23 
bug-reports 2021-03-02 10:37:27 i think i know what happened
bug-reports 2021-03-02 10:37:43 the saved stats got sent too early
bug-reports 2021-03-02 10:38:02 easily
bug-reports 2021-03-02 10:38:02 yes
bug-reports 2021-03-02 10:38:23 its probably because i did a few optimizations lol
bug-reports 2021-03-02 10:38:43 so the server is loading faster now xd
bug-reports 2021-03-02 10:41:52 <@!621817208313479248> try now?
bug-reports 2021-03-02 10:42:33 idk
bug-reports 2021-03-02 10:42:47 did it load now?
bug-reports 2021-03-02 10:43:13 try resetting them
bug-reports 2021-03-02 10:43:15 and rejoin
bug-reports 2021-03-02 10:43:31 otherwise im afraid theres only 1 way to fix them and thats by rewriting the remotes
bug-reports 2021-03-02 10:44:19 it worked for me though
bug-reports 2021-03-02 10:44:25 but i guess i have to rewrite the remotes -_-
bug-reports 2021-03-02 10:44:55 yes
bug-reports 2021-03-02 10:44:59 the game is hardcoded
bug-reports 2021-03-02 12:31:11 <@!403843930543882241>
bug-reports 2021-03-02 12:31:12 yes

bug-reports 2021-03-08 22:29:09 Yeah thats how roblox works
bug-reports 2021-03-08 22:29:24 If you lag, you appear to go slower than expected
bug-reports 2021-03-08 22:29:35 Yes so does it happen in a NEW vip?

bug-reports 2021-03-08 22:49:23 And i havent updated the game so i have 0 idea whats causing it
bug-reports 2021-03-08 22:49:36 As the servers were already reset at the time i updated the game
bug-reports 2021-03-08 22:49:43 So its 100% roblox their fault
bug-reports 2021-03-08 22:50:09 They’re probably trying to push their new physics stepping method
bug-reports 2021-03-08 22:50:29 The one which i told them was game breaking
bug-reports 2021-03-08 22:50:48 the first time i tested it i sank right through the ground
bug-reports 2021-03-08 22:51:06 Its all out of my reach
bug-reports 2021-03-08 22:51:09 Its all roblox

bug-reports 2021-05-10 16:00:09 Game is hardcoded
bug-reports 2021-05-10 16:00:15 I will work on it in the rewrite
bug-reports 2021-05-15 14:59:59 <@!738702049113538600> thanks for telling me, i did not know that
bug-reports 2021-05-15 15:02:00 you cant expect me to literally know everything
bug-reports 2021-05-15 15:02:04 it has to be posted in this channel
bug-reports 2021-05-15 15:02:05 for me to know about it
bug-reports 2021-05-15 15:02:26 and sometimes i just forget stuff aswell, but its better if its posted in here
bug-reports 2021-05-15 15:03:06 i dont play the entire game constantly anymore, the most i do nowadays is work on the rewrite
bug-reports 2021-05-15 15:03:18 so i dont experience the full thing
bug-reports 2021-05-15 15:11:07 wasn't directly talking to you sorry

bug-reports 2021-05-17 09:43:23 Is it big or small
bug-reports 2021-05-17 16:07:35 Thats because the game is hardcoded
bug-reports 2021-05-17 16:07:51 I have solved that in the rewrite

bug-reports 2021-05-27 15:11:27 seems to be working for me
bug-reports 2021-05-27 17:16:24 I dont see what is wrong with the fireworks
bug-reports 2021-05-28 16:11:45 <@!200793484053970944> does the top side weld though?
bug-reports 2021-05-28 16:18:00 im really busy working on the ropes right now
bug-reports 2021-05-28 18:16:55 setup?
bug-reports 2021-05-28 18:16:58 how to build it
bug-reports 2021-05-28 18:17:23 what about regular anchor
bug-reports 2021-05-28 18:18:26 thats how roblox physics works
bug-reports 2021-05-28 18:18:31 but i need some easy setup i can work on
bug-reports 2021-05-28 18:19:01 so send me a pic of the config
bug-reports 2021-05-28 18:19:07 and in build mode the blocks
bug-reports 2021-05-28 18:22:37 ?
bug-reports 2021-05-28 18:22:46 what do you mean
bug-reports 2021-05-28 18:22:51 locked seems fine
bug-reports 2021-05-28 18:23:08 i haven't had that happen
bug-reports 2021-05-28 18:23:16 i thought roblox solved teleporting back
bug-reports 2021-05-28 18:23:50 i had the locked motors teleporting back happen aswell
bug-reports 2021-05-28 18:23:57 but it seems to be solved for me now
bug-reports 2021-05-28 18:25:53 wow
bug-reports 2021-05-28 18:25:56 the motor one is weird
bug-reports 2021-05-28 18:26:21 its probably because of server lag
bug-reports 2021-05-28 18:26:29 look at how big your creation is
bug-reports 2021-05-28 18:26:48 show me
bug-reports 2021-05-28 18:27:59 see lol
bug-reports 2021-05-28 18:28:11 its probably because of the server lag
bug-reports 2021-05-28 18:28:20 server lag will be fixed in the rewrite though
bug-reports 2021-05-28 18:28:28 everything that is physics based is buggy
bug-reports 2021-05-28 18:28:31 and broken
bug-reports 2021-05-28 18:28:51 i know
bug-reports 2021-05-28 18:29:30 <@!527653676022628353>
bug-reports 2021-05-28 18:29:35 can you try something
bug-reports 2021-05-28 18:29:49 use 2 motors for 1 rotating part
bug-reports 2021-05-28 18:29:59 
bug-reports 2021-05-28 18:30:11 <@456226577798135808> how did you achieve that
bug-reports 2021-05-28 18:30:42 
bug-reports 2021-05-28 18:30:42 no
bug-reports 2021-05-28 18:30:43 like this
bug-reports 2021-05-28 18:30:46 locked
bug-reports 2021-05-28 18:30:50 for the ship
bug-reports 2021-05-28 18:31:33 <@456226577798135808> but the sword has ropes?
bug-reports 2021-05-28 18:31:47 then what are those ropes around you
bug-reports 2021-05-28 18:31:59 whats causing that
bug-reports 2021-05-28 18:34:56 <@456226577798135808> what if you remove the helium
bug-reports 2021-05-28 18:35:08 <@!527653676022628353> video?
bug-reports 2021-05-28 18:43:11 
bug-reports 2021-05-28 18:43:14 this is how you solve the wobblyness
bug-reports 2021-05-28 18:43:26 but motor storm is something else
bug-reports 2021-05-28 18:43:50 motors being bent is because of an extreme force
bug-reports 2021-05-28 18:44:12 yes
bug-reports 2021-05-28 18:44:15 extreme force
bug-reports 2021-05-28 18:44:25 push
bug-reports 2021-05-28 18:44:26 pull
bug-reports 2021-05-28 18:44:29 yes
bug-reports 2021-05-28 18:44:41 how do you make a motor bend
bug-reports 2021-05-28 18:44:43 get me a setup
bug-reports 2021-05-28 18:44:56 if i can make it happen myself i can fix it
bug-reports 2021-05-28 18:45:20 i know how to improve the physics anchor now
bug-reports 2021-05-28 18:45:39 get me a setup
bug-reports 2021-05-28 18:45:45 i cant test your entire aircraft
bug-reports 2021-05-28 18:46:57 for bending the motor
bug-reports 2021-05-28 18:48:00 idk
bug-reports 2021-05-28 18:48:00 big builds might be lag then
bug-reports 2021-05-28 18:48:12 im going to work on a solution for the motor storm first
bug-reports 2021-05-28 20:30:44 <@!527653676022628353>
bug-reports 2021-05-28 20:30:53 i have tried creating something that looks like the rope solution
bug-reports 2021-05-28 20:31:06 eventually it just completely messes up lol
bug-reports 2021-05-28 20:31:21 but it doesn't fling extremely far though
bug-reports 2021-05-28 20:31:51 if i disable my solution it just instantly jumps into the void
bug-reports 2021-05-28 20:35:44 
bug-reports 2021-05-28 20:35:47 do you guys really want that?
bug-reports 2021-05-28 20:36:08 its shaking rapidly due to the force
bug-reports 2021-05-28 20:47:44 ?
bug-reports 2021-05-28 20:47:47 i dont get it
bug-reports 2021-05-28 20:48:49 isn't that what the pop up is for?
bug-reports 2021-05-28 20:49:29 doesn't that already happen?
bug-reports 2021-05-28 20:50:37 i will relook at the autosave in the rewrite
bug-reports 2021-05-28 20:50:52 i had already noticed the autosave is hardcoded in
bug-reports 2021-05-28 20:52:44 ofcourse i can
bug-reports 2021-05-28 20:53:09 i already found it annoying but the guns are hardcoded in i believe
bug-reports 2021-05-28 20:53:19 not sure
bug-reports 2021-05-28 20:53:30 but i can take a look at it once i finish what im currently working on
bug-reports 2021-05-28 20:54:00 
bug-reports 2021-05-28 20:54:03 <@!458012038594166795>
bug-reports 2021-05-28 20:54:10 <@!773287769488752653>
bug-reports 2021-05-28 20:54:16 i can probably make it more clear
bug-reports 2021-05-28 20:54:30 as of now its white for loading and red for saving
bug-reports 2021-05-28 20:54:34 yeah
bug-reports 2021-05-28 20:54:39 its similar and thats the issue
bug-reports 2021-05-28 20:54:43 i got fooled by it aswell before
bug-reports 2021-05-28 20:54:55 no
bug-reports 2021-05-28 20:55:07 i need to change sizes and add a color to certain words
bug-reports 2021-05-28 20:55:14 make it not look similar
bug-reports 2021-05-28 20:55:19 like
bug-reports 2021-05-28 20:55:22 load blue
bug-reports 2021-05-28 20:55:26 save red
bug-reports 2021-05-28 20:55:52 and then the text just white for an example
bug-reports 2021-05-28 20:56:15 wait i know something i can already do right now
bug-reports 2021-05-28 20:56:57 you can press undo twice
bug-reports 2021-05-28 20:57:02 it always undo's
bug-reports 2021-05-28 20:57:19 you can switch through 2 creations
bug-reports 2021-05-28 20:58:33 nice
bug-reports 2021-05-28 20:58:37 i didn't think of that
bug-reports 2021-05-28 21:03:19 i found a gui creator
bug-reports 2021-05-28 21:03:23 he's working on new gui and stuff

bug-reports 2021-05-28 21:04:34

bug-reports 2021-05-28 21:05:27 ahhhh man
bug-reports 2021-05-28 21:05:30 this is so hardcoded
bug-reports 2021-05-28 21:06:15 ?
bug-reports 2021-05-28 21:06:15 
bug-reports 2021-05-28 21:08:48 scaled aswell?
bug-reports 2021-05-28 21:09:03 idk

bug-reports 2021-05-28 21:49:19 <@!683847069890510887>
bug-reports 2021-05-28 21:49:41 thats from the rewrite
bug-reports 2021-05-28 21:49:55 but i cant directly port it into the game because it will break everything
bug-reports 2021-05-28 21:49:58 it required a full rewrite
bug-reports 2021-05-28 21:50:10 all of the game mechanics are being changed

bug-reports 2021-05-30 02:39:16 <@!200793484053970944> do you want it to weld at every surface?
bug-reports 2021-05-30 11:32:35 <@844524654340210689> i dont see what the issue is
bug-reports 2021-05-30 11:33:05 You are just shooting rockets???
bug-reports 2021-05-30 18:53:14 <@!546223347025969164> i have been a victim to it myself aswell, ofcourse!
i will look into improving the detection in the rewrite
bug-reports 2021-06-03 13:49:11 <@521458738981502987> try not skipping the loading screen maybe?
bug-reports 2021-06-03 13:49:40 Yes
bug-reports 2021-06-03 13:49:50 You skipped the loading too fast maybe
bug-reports 2021-06-03 13:50:06 Exactly
bug-reports 2021-06-03 22:05:22 arrgghh roblox
bug-reports 2021-06-03 22:05:24 y u do this
the-dump 2021-06-03 23:28:36 
bug-reports 2021-06-05 16:09:28 Its because i dont have a GUI creator, i am stuck to roblox standard buttons and those do not allow for transparency sadly.
bug-reports 2021-06-05 22:10:59 <@456226577798135808>

bug-reports 2021-06-05 22:21:48 not inventor
bug-reports 2021-06-05 22:21:57 i need to know what causes the suspension to break
bug-reports 2021-06-05 22:22:28 how to make it
bug-reports 2021-06-05 22:22:35 <@!527653676022628353>
bug-reports 2021-06-05 22:22:58 locked motors or
bug-reports 2021-06-05 22:27:58 you are right
bug-reports 2021-06-05 22:28:00 thats so weird
bug-reports 2021-06-05 22:28:07 with regular blocks it doesn't happen
bug-reports 2021-06-05 22:28:14 since when has that been happening? <@!527653676022628353>
bug-reports 2021-06-05 22:28:19 within the last week
bug-reports 2021-06-05 22:28:20 or forever
bug-reports 2021-06-05 22:28:42 i cant because everyone has been having issues with it
bug-reports 2021-06-05 22:28:45 with no proof
bug-reports 2021-06-05 22:28:52 or most like it being their own fault
bug-reports 2021-06-05 22:33:04 i dont think it has always been happening
bug-reports 2021-06-05 22:33:12 this is probably why people are complaining a lot lately
bug-reports 2021-06-05 22:33:20 https://streamable.com/s467c1
bug-reports 2021-06-05 22:37:34 <@!559462059251859456> do those wings have pistons?

bug-reports 2021-06-05 22:48:12 working on it
bug-reports 2021-06-05 22:48:17 roblox seems to have messed up again
bug-reports 2021-06-05 22:53:35 working on it
bug-reports 2021-06-05 22:53:45 
bug-reports 2021-06-05 22:57:45 there is no fix
bug-reports 2021-06-05 22:57:48 its roblox their fault
bug-reports 2021-06-06 02:08:24 no?
bug-reports 2021-06-06 02:11:32 you dont seem to have a pvp slider
bug-reports 2021-06-06 02:11:41 you must be in a public server
bug-reports 2021-06-06 02:11:50 invite me to the server
bug-reports 2021-06-06 17:57:04 <@!368581738496131072> <#490306593242611742>
bug-reports 2021-06-08 00:49:50 <@!368581738496131072>
bug-reports 2021-06-08 00:49:58 Can u check if it still happens
bug-reports 2021-06-08 00:50:02 
bug-reports 2021-06-08 00:50:05 <@!527653676022628353>
bug-reports 2021-06-08 00:50:08 <@456226577798135808>
bug-reports 2021-06-08 01:14:24 <@!527653676022628353> can u check the motors freaking out
bug-reports 2021-06-08 01:14:33 somehow the motors freaking out setup was fixed
creations-chat 2021-06-08 01:21:41 This needs no ping
bug-reports 2021-06-08 01:23:38 Can u confirm and check whether its fixed
bug-reports 2021-06-08 01:23:48 And what exactly is fixed compared to before
bug-reports 2021-06-08 01:24:12 Tell me what is fixed now
bug-reports 2021-06-08 01:24:22 The motor breaking?
bug-reports 2021-06-08 01:24:25 What about ropes
bug-reports 2021-06-08 01:24:30 Nvm
bug-reports 2021-06-08 01:24:33 Dont do ropes
bug-reports 2021-06-08 01:24:37 What about the suspension
bug-reports 2021-06-08 01:24:42 Any other physics issues?
bug-reports 2021-06-08 01:25:28 For real?
bug-reports 2021-06-08 01:25:34 Since when
bug-reports 2021-06-08 01:25:59 Its been disabled since 3 hours ago
bug-reports 2021-06-08 01:26:40 The change that caused the issues
bug-reports 2021-06-08 01:27:29 So everything is accurate now?
bug-reports 2021-06-08 01:27:45 No?
bug-reports 2021-06-08 01:27:49 In what way
bug-reports 2021-06-08 01:27:59 ??
bug-reports 2021-06-08 01:28:11 Try it
bug-reports 2021-06-08 01:28:21 Might be
bug-reports 2021-06-08 01:28:47 Haven’t really been for me
bug-reports 2021-06-08 01:28:52 <@!527653676022628353> so its fixed?
bug-reports 2021-06-08 01:29:05 They are still bending?
bug-reports 2021-06-08 01:29:32 That probably means its most likely fixed
bug-reports 2021-06-08 01:30:33 It seems to have to do with network delay
bug-reports 2021-06-08 01:30:44 Wait 5 seconds before releasing the motor with motor lock
bug-reports 2021-06-08 01:31:40 Yeah the server lacks behind when it lags so
bug-reports 2021-06-08 01:33:04 I can try fixing that in the rewrite though
bug-reports 2021-06-08 01:33:24 I can probably just cframe all of the rootparts on the server
bug-reports 2021-06-08 01:33:28 To match the client
bug-reports 2021-06-08 01:34:55 Teleport the parts on the side of the motor you are moving
bug-reports 2021-06-08 01:35:07 To the place where you let go of the key on your screen
bug-reports 2021-06-08 01:35:36 Parts = blocks
bug-reports 2021-06-08 01:36:01 But i’d also need to teleport and do extra calculations for stuff like ropes
bug-reports 2021-06-08 01:36:08 Because those dont get teleported
bug-reports 2021-06-08 01:39:16 Also
bug-reports 2021-06-08 01:39:35 I thought roblox had fixed the network delay for weldconstraints
bug-reports 2021-06-08 01:39:42 <@!527653676022628353>
bug-reports 2021-06-08 01:39:52 I dont seem to have issues with them
bug-reports 2021-06-08 01:40:11 Are you sure you always have them
bug-reports 2021-06-08 01:40:21 Or you just have them on massive builds
bug-reports 2021-06-08 01:44:32 Lockmode
bug-reports 2021-06-08 01:48:56 Can someone tell the engineer that whatever he has just disabled 100% fixed the physics in the game
bug-reports 2021-06-08 01:49:06 And beg him to keep it disabled
bug-reports 2021-06-08 01:49:26 Look in announcements
bug-reports 2021-06-08 01:49:28 <@!527653676022628353>
bug-reports 2021-06-08 01:49:41 As soon as they fix the suspension part its going to go live again
bug-reports 2021-06-08 01:49:48 And everything else will break again
bug-reports 2021-06-08 01:50:07 Look at the link in announcements
bug-reports 2021-06-08 01:50:10 X2
bug-reports 2021-06-08 01:50:13 Yes
bug-reports 2021-06-08 01:50:20 That guy disabled it
bug-reports 2021-06-08 01:50:23 Also be nice please
bug-reports 2021-06-08 01:50:59 Just take a screenshot of my message i guess lol
bug-reports 2021-06-08 01:51:06 Wait no
bug-reports 2021-06-08 01:51:08 Dont do that
bug-reports 2021-06-08 01:51:16 Not allowed to
bug-reports 2021-06-08 01:51:32 You should tell him your personal experience on him reverting the change
bug-reports 2021-06-08 01:51:45 What do you feel has been fixed now because of it
bug-reports 2021-06-08 01:52:18 Wow
bug-reports 2021-06-08 01:52:24 This literally fixed the entire game
bug-reports 2021-06-08 01:52:32 There was a server crasher with motors
bug-reports 2021-06-08 01:52:41 And it doesn’t happen anymore now
bug-reports 2021-06-08 01:52:48 Because he reverted the “change”

bug-reports 2021-06-12 11:39:33 There isn’t really a way to create paint blocks without doing that
bug-reports 2021-06-12 13:54:13 maybe in the future
bug-reports 2021-06-12 17:23:01 <@!718006867808485447> about what
bug-reports 2021-06-12 17:23:05 you didn't mention something
bug-reports 2021-06-14 14:08:15 <@!655087990418309140> is it happening again?
bug-reports 2021-06-16 15:17:32 <@!721103577380159490> <@!659504870730235938> the game is infested with bugs because of multiple reasons.
1. when the game was made it wasn't intended to become this popular and an actual game, so everything was hardcoded and messy / easy to break
2. roblox physics is terrible sometimes
3. roblox updates sometimes breaks certain game mechanics.

bug-reports 2021-08-26 13:53:16 Usually in pc1 the ping rises all the way to 6000ms
bug-reports 2021-08-26 13:53:25 In pc2 it never goes above 100
bug-reports 2021-08-26 13:53:53 Pc2 is amazingly optimized
bug-reports 2021-08-27 17:59:34 Dont quit, you dont need to wait for pc2 to experience whats already available atm

bug-reports 2021-09-01 11:55:27 And definitely dont re-join too fast after leaving
bug-reports 2021-09-01 12:13:17 If your savedata is being saved and you somehow manage to join a new server faster than its able to save, you have the chance of loading your older savedata before the currently saving data has been saved

bug-reports 2021-11-16 07:26:52 I have improved spawning in creations today and compared it to pc1.

I literally couldn’t even realize what had happened thats how fast it spawned the plane in and teleported me, it literally took 0.01 seconds to spawn in.
in a live server its probably going to be 0.01 + ping due to latency ofcourse

creations-chat 2021-12-08 02:46:56 hey who wants free mod
bug-reports 2021-12-11 19:19:31 i cant figure out what causes it in pc1, i have tried multiple things and have been debugging for a really long time but it doesn't work yet its 100% supposed to be working
bug-reports 2021-12-11 19:19:40 its because the game is hardcoded
bug-reports 2021-12-12 06:30:23 it will be fixed in pc2
bug-reports 2021-12-15 08:45:20 <@!832478691170713611>
bug-reports 2021-12-15 08:45:28 i have fixed the issue and will shutdown the servers now
bug-reports 2021-12-15 08:46:52 <@!832478691170713611> do you mind helping with the final test before i shutdown

bug-reports 2021-12-15 08:52:19 you have to join my vip server
bug-reports 2021-12-15 09:09:18 ??????
bug-reports 2021-12-15 09:09:22 never heard of it
bug-reports 2021-12-15 09:10:11 strange
bug-reports 2021-12-15 09:10:26 tbh plane crazy 1 is just a complete hardcoded mess
bug-reports 2021-12-15 09:10:37 i really want to make plane crazy 2 way better
bug-reports 2021-12-15 09:10:40 and easier to work with
bug-reports 2021-12-15 09:10:48 so i know i can guarantee stuff will work
bug-reports 2021-12-15 09:11:01 yes
bug-reports 2021-12-15 09:11:02 less lag
bug-reports 2021-12-15 09:11:37 <@!690727914521493504>
bug-reports 2021-12-15 09:11:41 10 fps with how many blocks
bug-reports 2021-12-15 09:12:18 yes
bug-reports 2021-12-15 09:12:21 plane crazy 2
bug-reports 2021-12-15 09:12:31 you dont have to worry about lag in pc2
bug-reports 2021-12-15 09:12:58 what about just motor1
bug-reports 2021-12-15 09:13:10 combined yes
bug-reports 2021-12-15 09:13:12 i know
bug-reports 2021-12-15 09:13:54 in pc2
bug-reports 2021-12-15 09:14:05 the lag will be 20x less in pc2
bug-reports 2021-12-15 09:15:20 does it still lag when you take away everything except for the cockpit
bug-reports 2021-12-15 09:15:58 sorta?
bug-reports 2021-12-15 09:16:16 so its not completely because of the cockpit
bug-reports 2021-12-15 09:16:29 not sure
bug-reports 2021-12-15 09:16:39 might be less
bug-reports 2021-12-15 09:16:47 but haven't confirmed yet
bug-reports 2021-12-15 09:22:53 haven't confirmed
bug-reports 2021-12-15 09:23:07 when the game is done
bug-reports 2021-12-15 09:23:10 we will have a test dayt
bug-reports 2021-12-16 13:17:46 ???????????????????????????????
bug-reports 2021-12-16 13:18:10 normal
bug-reports 2021-12-16 13:18:28 when its above 2000 blocks it wont auto load due to the lag it could cause
bug-reports 2021-12-16 13:24:07 good idea
bug-reports 2021-12-16 15:15:05 whats your device
bug-reports 2021-12-16 15:15:06 <@!585175113314467852>

bug-reports 2021-12-16 15:29:36 which cpu and gpu do you have
bug-reports 2021-12-16 15:30:10 yet you crash? what
bug-reports 2021-12-16 15:30:17 show a picture of the crash
bug-reports 2021-12-16 15:34:45 why is discord showing ontop of the game
bug-reports 2021-12-16 15:35:09 try re-installing roblox?

bug-reports 2022-01-30 18:28:06 probably auto translation somehow
bug-reports 2022-01-30 18:28:10 really strange
bug-reports 2022-01-30 18:42:11 what happens when you reset
bug-reports 2022-01-30 18:42:31 do you only crash when you reset after having done that or while doing it
bug-reports 2022-02-02 17:07:45 Roblox probably messed something up again
bug-reports 2022-02-06 22:45:54 what happened? <@!753399511061233694>
bug-reports 2022-02-06 23:00:43 probably the game/server being unable to keep up
bug-reports 2022-02-06 23:00:50 lol
bug-reports 2022-02-06 23:00:57 it will be possible in pc2 though
bug-reports 2022-02-06 23:00:59 with ease
bug-reports 2022-02-06 23:01:16 im really curious to see what will happen to your creation in pc2
bug-reports 2022-02-06 23:01:19 send a pic in dms
bug-reports 2022-02-10 02:40:47 roblox broke it
bug-reports 2022-02-10 02:40:56 is it still not fixed?
bug-reports 2022-02-12 00:38:35 there will be better anti exploits in plane crazy 2
bug-reports 2022-02-12 02:21:55 its most likely due to it being a 7000 blocks creation but i can check it out
bug-reports 2022-02-12 02:22:02 <@!386687516989980672> you're having the issue right?
bug-reports 2022-02-12 02:22:08 i need you to join my vip server
bug-reports 2022-02-12 02:22:19 https://www.roblox.com/games/166986752?privateServerLinkCode=cF61H4MQAgsFFg7GO3jBm53SFf8WbiZK
bug-reports 2022-02-12 02:24:56 this man
bug-reports 2022-02-12 02:25:03 thats insane
bug-reports 2022-02-12 02:25:11 you're only halfway there
bug-reports 2022-02-12 02:25:19 what
bug-reports 2022-02-12 02:25:36 have there been some people with more than 2.1million savedata?
bug-reports 2022-02-12 02:25:56 but anyone at 2.5mil?
bug-reports 2022-02-12 02:26:25 <@!386687516989980672>
bug-reports 2022-02-12 02:26:32 make sure he joins my vip server so i can see the error message
bug-reports 2022-02-12 02:27:41 in plane crazy 2 i will add compression to the savedata count, it should make the savedata 2.3x smaller than what it currently is
bug-reports 2022-02-12 02:27:53 how much exactly
bug-reports 2022-02-12 02:28:08 you would get 2.25x more savedata
bug-reports 2022-02-12 02:28:17 yes i have some pretty good compression available
bug-reports 2022-02-12 02:30:41 slow wifi or lagging server: • Trouble loading into the game, loading bar doesn’t move
bug-reports 2022-02-12 02:30:44 sure
bug-reports 2022-02-12 02:32:21 cool thing you made for bugs and glitches
bug-reports 2022-02-12 02:32:40 <@!375281006091173890>
bug-reports 2022-02-12 02:32:51 what why
bug-reports 2022-02-12 02:32:54 theres a vip link
bug-reports 2022-02-12 03:00:28 and the other guy?
bug-reports 2022-02-12 03:03:28 so that seems to be the limit somehow
bug-reports 2022-02-12 03:03:33 strange
bug-reports 2022-02-12 03:03:43 there have been no other people above 2.14m savedata?
bug-reports 2022-02-12 03:03:53 i remember seeing someone with 4m
bug-reports 2022-02-12 03:04:47 i can only suggest trying to reduce the amount of blocks / savedata you currently have
bug-reports 2022-02-12 03:04:54 replace 1x1 blocks for longer blocks
bug-reports 2022-02-12 03:05:16 in pc2 there will be compression so you can more easily fit more savedata
bug-reports 2022-02-12 03:06:43 pc1 does not easily allow for compression to be used due to the complexity, pc2 will handle compression way better
bug-reports 2022-02-12 03:07:35 it reduces the savedata by a minimum of 2.25x
bug-reports 2022-02-12 03:07:42 i think
bug-reports 2022-02-12 03:08:04 it depends on how the savedata is layed out how much it would reduce
bug-reports 2022-02-12 03:08:05 no
bug-reports 2022-02-12 03:08:07 custom method
bug-reports 2022-02-12 03:10:10 is that what you have right now
bug-reports 2022-02-12 03:10:15 and does that work with saving?
bug-reports 2022-02-12 03:10:30 join my test server
bug-reports 2022-02-12 03:10:34 so i can see the errors if it fails
bug-reports 2022-02-12 03:24:09 maybe next month is the pre-alpha stage?

bug-reports 2022-02-12 03:57:08 i can only recommend trying to be careful, i will increase the savedata in pc2
bug-reports 2022-02-12 03:57:25 well actually i just realized
bug-reports 2022-02-12 03:57:42 savedata will most likely be decreased by 20x in pc2
bug-reports 2022-02-12 03:58:04 maybe even more
bug-reports 2022-02-12 03:58:05 like 30x
bug-reports 2022-02-12 03:58:18 will have to think about that
bug-reports 2022-02-12 04:00:31 due to the way pc2 works it will massively decrease the savedata already without compression
bug-reports 2022-02-13 15:41:32 will be fixed in pc2
bug-reports 2022-02-13 19:15:12 i know, roblox messed up and i have been trying to contact them for the past few days
bug-reports 2022-02-17 14:44:19 strange behaviour
bug-reports 2022-02-17 14:44:39 is there a way i can see this myself?
bug-reports 2022-02-17 17:24:17 I have tried for the past 2 years, its breaking due to the hardcoded nature of plane crazy, it will be fixed in pc2
bug-reports 2022-02-17 18:56:09 Early this year
bug-reports 2022-02-17 18:59:03 Yes
bug-reports 2022-02-17 19:16:49 I already know how many people play on which device
bug-reports 2022-02-17 19:34:12 there will always be more updates once the game is released, so if something does not get added it can always get added in an update
bug-reports 2022-02-17 19:34:23 more stuff is planned
bug-reports 2022-02-19 18:35:21 Roblox is working on solving the issue
bug-reports 2022-02-20 15:51:46 cool madattak just fixed an issue caused by roblox with the new wings, it might actually resolve the wobblyness you guys notice at high speeds
bug-reports 2022-02-20 17:36:57 Unsure
bug-reports 2022-02-20 17:37:07 Will have to see in pc2
bug-reports 2022-02-20 17:37:26 The new wings allow for wind
bug-reports 2022-02-20 19:30:18 No
bug-reports 2022-02-20 19:30:34 It was for pc2
the-dump 2022-02-20 21:27:04 nice
bug-reports 2022-02-22 21:45:54 Roblox said they were working on it
bug-reports 2022-02-26 12:02:43 I have no idea
bug-reports 2022-02-26 12:03:15 I have even told devrel about it but nobody is looking at it for some reason
bug-reports 2022-02-27 23:16:46 yes
bug-reports 2022-03-05 04:51:27 i managed to fix the lag issue and the chat having massive whitespaces
bug-reports 2022-03-05 04:51:40 roblox broke it but dont want to fix it themselves
bug-reports 2022-03-05 04:58:05 im waiting for madattak to publish it though
bug-reports 2022-03-07 19:13:01 Some vip servers dont work what
bug-reports 2022-03-07 19:13:06 Is this still happening
bug-reports 2022-03-08 01:08:55 i had an exam today
bug-reports 2022-03-08 01:09:02 madattak updated the game today
bug-reports 2022-03-08 01:09:21 i cant update the game myself so easily and everything just randomly keeps breaking
bug-reports 2022-03-08 01:10:44 i think i know what happened
bug-reports 2022-03-08 01:10:48 the servers failed to close
bug-reports 2022-03-08 01:11:07 and they have no way of safely shutting down now so i have to force close all servers and make everyone lose everything
bug-reports 2022-03-13 02:23:02 spawn locations are possible
bug-reports 2022-03-13 02:23:07 magnets we'll have to see
bug-reports 2022-03-13 02:23:16 its possible under certain conditions
bug-reports 2022-03-13 02:23:30 i mean
bug-reports 2022-03-13 02:23:39 its possible but some conditions will appear to be laggy and glitchy
bug-reports 2022-03-13 02:24:02 in pc1 its not possible due to the hardcoded nature but pc2 its possible

bug-reports 2022-05-20 13:00:20 its gamebreaking once it happens
bug-reports 2022-05-20 14:06:34 thats because you spammed a ton of stuff lol
bug-reports 2022-05-21 16:07:58 i tried to fix it multiple times, but its some weird type of issue i haven't been able to resolve sadly

bug-reports 2022-08-02 16:46:55 Show me a video of whats wrong so i can take a look at it
bug-reports 2022-08-03 10:35:11 I think its just the balast blocks
bug-reports 2022-08-03 10:35:23 Roblox might have done an internal update
help 2022-08-31 13:07:40 A gamepass is permanent you  must have somehow deleted it by accident or your account must have gotten compromised at some time
help 2022-08-31 13:08:47 I think theres an option to delete a gamepass off of your inventory
help 2022-08-31 13:09:10 Or try rejoining it might be possible that roblox is going down or failed to check if you own the gamepass somehow
help 2022-08-31 13:09:23 Click the jetpack button it’ll check again
bug-reports 2022-08-31 18:32:10 What happened here
bug-reports 2022-09-22 11:34:21 I will look into this
bug-reports 2022-09-27 00:37:28 i dont see the issue in studio for some reason
bug-reports 2022-09-27 00:40:12 i checked both my phone and pc but i cant seem to replicate the issue both ingame and in studio
bug-reports 2022-10-02 16:02:59 Its not my fault, roblox updates their engine without announcing it
bug-reports 2022-10-02 16:03:05 I’ll check it again
bug-reports 2022-10-09 14:23:59 What kind of lagspikes
bug-reports 2022-10-09 14:24:24 When someone spawns in?
bug-reports 2022-10-09 14:24:34 I cant help that except in pc2
bug-reports 2022-10-09 14:25:10 I also cant test to see the issue because roblox completely broke studio testing for me
bug-reports 2022-10-09 14:25:57 I’ll see if i can do something
bug-reports 2022-10-09 14:33:33 Roblox might be saving resources on servers, thats really strange behaviour
bug-reports 2022-10-09 14:33:57 Could also be a broken update they pushed out
bug-reports 2022-10-09 14:35:33 I’ll investigate it
bug-reports 2022-10-09 14:38:43 Wow this lag is insane
bug-reports 2022-10-09 14:38:53 Just by joining
bug-reports 2022-10-09 14:38:58 It takes 1 minute
bug-reports 2022-10-09 14:39:01 To get a plot
bug-reports 2022-10-09 14:39:06 Nothing is being spawned in
bug-reports 2022-10-09 14:39:14 I have no idea what they have done
bug-reports 2022-10-09 15:09:44 i figured out roblox has caused this

bug-reports 2023-07-11 18:01:22 Have made a bug report about it <@707177889094697040>
bug-reports 2023-07-11 18:02:22 Did you place a block
bug-reports 2023-07-11 18:02:29 Which block
bug-reports 2023-07-11 18:02:44 And on which block did you place it
bug-reports 2023-07-11 18:03:19 Can you repeat it while recording?
bug-reports 2023-07-11 18:03:33 Just place the wedge on the same spot
bug-reports 2023-07-11 18:03:40 And the motor too
bug-reports 2023-07-11 18:04:34 Wait so you couldnt delete it
bug-reports 2023-07-11 18:04:38 Because of lag
bug-reports 2023-07-11 18:04:45 Did it disappear after the lag
bug-reports 2023-07-11 18:05:03 did you place a block on it after you tried to delete it
bug-reports 2023-07-11 18:06:19 So you placed a motor, tried to delete it, placed a block on the motor and then when the lag went away you got the message?
bug-reports 2023-07-11 18:06:39 Ontop of eachother
bug-reports 2023-07-11 18:06:52 So you placed 2 motors while the lag was active
bug-reports 2023-07-11 18:07:06 And then deleted both motors?
bug-reports 2023-07-11 18:07:21 I dont understand
bug-reports 2023-07-11 18:07:32 Please make a step by step list on what to do to make it happen
bug-reports 2023-07-11 18:08:24 Did you press delete on both motors?
bug-reports 2023-07-11 18:08:37 Only 1?
bug-reports 2023-07-11 18:08:43 Ok
bug-reports 2023-07-11 18:08:52 So nothing else?
bug-reports 2023-07-11 18:09:00 I’ll see if i can repeat it
bug-reports 2023-07-11 18:09:10 Wdym moving them
bug-reports 2023-07-11 18:09:38 When did you do that
bug-reports 2023-07-11 19:30:32 Will take a look
bug-reports 2023-07-12 12:24:24 How did you make it happen?
bug-reports 2023-07-12 12:24:31 Whats your username and slotnum?

bug-reports 2023-07-13 16:42:10 Maybe it appears to be an issue now because the server does not fully freeze anymore which means it can actually send data now showing your high ping
bug-reports 2023-07-13 16:42:55 Does it make the gameplay worse or is it improved compared to before
bug-reports 2023-07-13 16:43:52 It refuses to load?
bug-reports 2023-07-13 16:44:08 I can take a look and try to find the source if you want
bug-reports 2023-07-13 16:44:18 I might be able to fix it to allow you to load in
