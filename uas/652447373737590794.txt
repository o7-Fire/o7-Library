bug-reports 2020-10-21 13:17:25 > Due to Ping/client-side lag, if you attempt to damage someone in PVP with weapons (especially guns) the model appears to "freeze" in midair, but the creation itself is completely fine on their screens. I believe this is because when you hit someone on your screen, due to ping you may not be actually hitting their actual position that the server renders and thus bugs out.
<@!568818354060787743> Addition: The model also freezes midair when a part is detached from their build. Not too small, like a single block, but a buncha blocks, like a 5x5 part.

creations-chat 2021-02-11 15:41:05 I could use some feedback. Anything? Both negative and positive feedback would be useful.
creations-chat 2021-02-11 15:43:55 Thank you!
creations-chat 2021-02-11 15:49:08 I dont think so, but maybe you could help. These are the problems that I think the turret has. The right side (From this angle) is where the motorlock bridge lies.
creations-chat 2021-02-11 15:51:38 Slowmode exists, forgot to send this.
creations-chat 2021-02-11 16:09:02 The "what happened" you are referring to the left the of the mantlet is the motorlock to connect the mantlet.

The motorlock to the right of the turret is the motorlock for the barrel of the gun to be in place. A misplaced barrel would be highly uncomfortable, no?
creations-chat 2021-02-11 16:11:24 I have no experience with hiding motorlocks inside the turret.
creations-chat 2021-02-11 16:15:08 I want to give my mantlet the ability to elevate and depress, but a function or motorlock of higher level than the ones show on this Tiger of mine, apparently fries my brain. If you do not mind, can you provide a demonstation? <@!587393222855229457>

Maybe I could go to a public server and you can join me.
creations-chat 2021-02-11 16:18:13 <@!587393222855229457> I understand what you mean. I'll attempt to do so. I'll remind you if I receive difficulties, thank you!

<@!287454032250011649> I'll fix the lengthy barrel immediately, and if you do not mind me asking, what does LFP mean?
creations-chat 2021-02-11 16:24:24 Did it become any better? <@!287454032250011649> 

Just to clarify, I am still waiting on the LFP. What is LFP? Could you show me a picture of it? I'll make sure to fix it immediately if I can.
creations-chat 2021-02-11 16:30:14 Made barrel shorter, and moved the driver's viewport to right (This angle) a single block.

Also made sure to include the Lower Front Plate.
creations-chat 2021-02-11 16:38:14 <@!287454032250011649> Lower Front Plate fixed! How does it look?
creations-chat 2021-02-12 02:26:44 Hey, I made a tiger, this isnt an anime pfp if you ask me.
creations-chat 2021-02-12 14:46:26 Feedback is super appreciated! Anything to improve on my Tiger? That would be very essential for my Tiger, which is final, but if you think it needs improvement, please point it out! I will fix it ASAP and put in as much effort as I can, and if I am unable to do so, I will ping you, and ask for assistance. If you don't want to be pinged, just tell me. 

If you are willing to give me some assistance, or better, a demonstration, just DM me! Im available, and will be for the next few hours. Thank you!

creations-chat 2021-02-13 21:44:53 While the entire aircraft needs rebuilding, you have lots of potential as a new player! While not so great, you will make a better build in the future. Use good-looking builds in <#384025409945337856>! Determination, JV.
the-dump 2021-02-13 21:45:05 I know, I know...
bot-central 2021-02-13 21:50:22 Eh?

the-dump 2021-02-13 22:41:59 Tenno heika banzai!
creations-chat 2021-02-13 23:03:51 I see what you mean.
creations-chat 2021-02-14 11:08:01 While your colors may be decent, a better look would be good! Your superstructure is kinda of missing out on space between Turret C (Second turret from the left). Your hull might need a reshape! Balancing is necessary for a good ship, a ship will not move if it is not balanced. The platforms for the superfiring turrets are kind of blocky, why not make them Cylinders? They'll look better! The turrets are requiring work, but they can do okay on Destroyers! It looks like a Light Cruiser or Battleship, if you ask me.

The secondaries are open-topped, that is quite unique, but in order to make it look better, they also need a rework. Darken the deck color, raise the hull for it's waterline to show a bit, and add more superstructure!

Your journey to make a good build is still beginning. Use ships in <#384025409945337856> for inspiration, ask tips from people or if you don't know how to do something, you can ask people for a demonstation! You can use 3d Models of ships in the internet too if you want a reference! Do not give up hope, Epic. Fight on!

I'm right here too, while I may be improving on Aircraft, I can probably help you on tanks and ships. Especially Battleships, throw them at me.
creations-chat 2021-02-14 11:12:04 I'm not actually sure, but I don't give a single heck whether or not it's a joke ship. I'll give feedback whenever possible!
creations-chat 2021-02-14 11:14:24 I sense that this will be an excellent build. Smooth curves, easy on the eyes, keep it up, and it WILL be pure perfection! Keep it up!

creations-chat 2021-02-14 16:34:19 Excellent! It’s the perfect shape of a shark, I have no problems with the shark. Keep doing good, and in the long run, you’ll have a build you’ll be proud of in the future. Have a good day!

the-dump 2021-02-14 16:53:21 Cod Mobile?
the-dump 2021-02-14 16:53:33 I prefer the Arctic .50.
the-dump 2021-02-14 16:53:55 And good god, aren’t you slow as hell if you put a full firepower attachment.
the-dump 2021-02-14 16:54:24 The Arctic is quite forgiving in terms of fire rate.
the-dump 2021-02-14 16:54:35 You can rapid fire with the Arctic .50.
the-dump 2021-02-14 16:55:08 So if you miss one shot, you can fire another immediately.
the-dump 2021-02-14 16:55:19 That’s one thing, I guess.
the-dump 2021-02-14 16:55:35 Pro I, yeah.
the-dump 2021-02-14 16:55:37 Pro I.
the-dump 2021-02-14 16:55:55 Yep.
the-dump 2021-02-14 16:56:26 In Ranked BR, it’s around V5, I think...
the-dump 2021-02-14 16:56:31 Yeah, V5.
the-dump 2021-02-14 16:57:07 You level up quite quickly if you play BR.
the-dump 2021-02-14 16:57:19 You can level up multiple guns at the same time too in BR.
the-dump 2021-02-14 16:57:52 But one BR match is lengthy, and your absolutely in despair if someone keeps disturbing you every like, minute.
the-dump 2021-02-14 16:58:17 Which makes MP better for quick matches.
the-dump 2021-02-14 16:58:25 To be exact, Search & Destroy.

the-dump 2021-02-14 17:07:49 By the way, am I even using grammar correctly?

the-dump 2021-02-14 17:10:34 Ah, I see what you mean.
the-dump 2021-02-14 17:11:58 Learning english was hell.

the-dump 2021-02-14 17:13:07 Well, that I have to agree with.

the-dump 2021-02-14 17:13:42 Katakana, Kanji and Hiragana.
the-dump 2021-02-14 17:13:50 Indeed.
the-dump 2021-02-14 17:15:28 Kanji is basically chinese ideographic symbols.
the-dump 2021-02-14 17:16:13 There’s a few thousand kanji characters, and no, I am not kidding, and Hiragana and Katakana have 46 each.
the-dump 2021-02-14 17:16:38 Japanese Writing, a beautifully complex system.
the-dump 2021-02-14 17:20:06 Romaji is one easy way of turning Japanese characters into English characters but still pronounced Japanese.

the-dump 2021-02-15 00:55:54 I see, I see.

creations-chat 2021-02-15 01:44:10 <@!715790423959797783> About the bomber you were asking for feedback for;

The fuselage looks decent, but you can do much better! The wings are excellent, but the engines are wonky. Why not make them cylinders and motorlock wing panels to fill in the gaps? And then slap the propeller engines behind them. The tailwing requires another look, so make sure to give that an improvement!

While your aircraft is good to go, it could use alot more improvement! Keep building, Hartman!
creations-chat 2021-02-15 01:52:27 <@!715790423959797783> The tank you asked for feedback;

The turret is too small for the Ratte, and the hull needs a bit more curves. I recommend adding suspensions too, for better offroad performance!

creations-chat 2021-02-16 16:43:10 Superb! The cupola is well done, the viewports are excellent, the bogie wheels and idle wheels are very well designed, and the gradient on the schurzen is just perfect! You have a very good Stug III G, so keep it up, and you’ll be even a better builder, learning things!
creations-chat 2021-02-18 11:35:31 <@!550335806196416532> Your carrier is overall decent, but that squarish platform sticking out the hull is too noticeable, making the build somewhat... worse. The colors are decent, the hull is decent, but you have to fix that, like extend it or something. Another thing, your white lines on the hull is too blocky. Maybe you could motorlock a delta wing onto those lines to make them... smoother? Your ramp is too awkward too. Maybe give the ramp's sides some slopes to connect it with the runway or something, instead of the awkward corner. Overall, you can do better, and I know that! Ganbatte, Fajny! (Good luck, Fajny!) (Im Japanese.)
creations-chat 2021-02-18 11:46:37 Any opinions?
creations-chat 2021-02-18 11:57:38 Fixed some problems that people had on my carrier;
- Hull Color `TOO BRIGHT`
- Flight Deck `BLOCKY`

<@!707588709389697064>: "why green"
I based this carrier off of the Shinano. This is not Shinano, but a ship based off of it.
the-dump 2021-02-18 14:41:01 Uhh...

creations-chat 2021-02-18 16:23:11 You’ll get better soon. Just put in effort into your builds, ask for help, ask for tips, gather inspiration in <#384025409945337856> and soon you’ll become a great builder. Right now, im transitioning from a decent ship hull to a better, much more refined ship hull. Ascending, probably. Ganbare, Mineu-san.

creations-chat 2021-02-18 16:33:15 If you look closely beside the forward boiler, the Destroyer (currently what I call is a ZX-Class) has secondary turrets. Just thought it would be a unique idea, as it IS a large destroyer, 15x 533mm Torpedo Tubes (I think), 12x guns, and with AA, what else could be a better gunboat and torpedo boat combination than this???

creations-chat 2021-03-03 17:31:06 I once had tutorials myself. Although that was in my early days. I remember this Bismarck tutorial... That’s where I got my ship hull from and where I got my ship expertise from. That Bismarck tutorial is long gone from my account already. I learned how to make ships from tutorials. From the tutorial’s simple hull, to my own better looking but more complex hull.
creations-chat 2021-03-03 17:33:48 My ships.
creations-chat 2021-03-03 17:36:59 I am currently working on a new better looking hull.

By the way, im Japanese. Am I making any grammar or spelling mistakes so far?
creations-chat 2021-03-03 17:39:23 Other than the hull, I am reworking that. What else needs improvement?

creations-chat 2021-04-05 14:29:10 Creating a custom Japanese Battleship, based on the Fuso. Just starting off, is the hull too narrow or is it just right? Ignore the holes by the way, I'll fill those later.
the-dump 2021-04-05 17:52:25 
creations-chat 2021-04-06 02:03:02 Renewed the hull because the previous was too complicated and didnt leave any space. How's this one?
help 2021-04-06 07:27:04 How do you piston lock? In Japanese Battleships, at the bow, there is a yellow plate that is thin. This is too thick, making it look bad. I want to piston lock this.
help 2021-04-06 07:30:01 Yes, that part in Japanese Battleships.
help 2021-04-06 07:31:02 Oh, forgot about that.

Guess this is MY version of a Tiger.
creations-chat 2021-06-11 16:19:15 I mean, that's an old version, I changed it a few times since that picture, but the wheels, did not change it. 

Oh and, what's wrong with the wheels?
creations-chat 2021-06-11 16:21:49 Not yet, but I'll take one.
