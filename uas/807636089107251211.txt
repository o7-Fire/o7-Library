creations-chat 2023-04-03 18:09:17 could work in a bigger scale but not on roscale
creations-chat 2023-04-03 20:19:51 bre meeting skille players in public server is as rare as it never has been
creations-chat 2023-04-03 20:25:53 its not what i understand to skilled but nowadays you dont even see people building tuts anymore, just stupid stuff looking  like <@1006548230152126586> mirage 6500 or what it was nh stuff. its hard to define skilled
creations-chat 2023-04-03 20:31:30 jeff k we get youre good, now shut. And i wouldnt declare myself as a noob but also not rly great prbly around top 35% of somewhat good players
creations-chat 2023-04-03 20:34:02 the thing is i have no rly good creations cause i could do great stuff but no motivation so most my builds just happen cause iam bored and dont put any afford into them. and thats what happens when no motivation: https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/384025409945337856/1091451456374182008
creations-chat 2023-04-03 20:37:09 yk, having perfectism and lazyness at the same time isnt great

creations-chat 2023-04-03 20:44:09 i cant stop thinking its to big but compared to x-ray its pretty much in scale. Usinmg warthunder as a reference is way to underrated btw
creations-chat 2023-04-03 20:48:24 nah aint that much motorlock yet
creations-chat 2023-04-04 08:52:31 ik
creations-chat 2023-04-04 09:20:38 nth else to add. Iam Feldwebell Eric.
creations-chat 2023-04-04 09:29:21 i rly should finish this, but making the tail is difficult
creations-chat 2023-04-04 13:16:14 Type 90b turret, repost with better pics
creations-chat 2023-04-04 13:21:11 ye no shit, welcome to the community sherlock
creations-chat 2023-04-04 13:23:16 what you think of my turret? ik youre quite known in the comunity
creations-chat 2023-04-04 13:26:45 Type 90b, its Japanese. idk how to do the granage launchers rly cause they are to small to rly be done in scale. and im working on finishing the basic shape, after that ill start with detail of the turret
creations-chat 2023-04-04 13:31:14 why the hail was my message deleted.
creations-chat 2023-04-04 13:33:55 Ye, i think its fair to call him one of or the best plane crazy builder and content-creator
creations-chat 2023-04-04 13:38:37 <@297120728342331392> the thing is simply , that your standarts are higher than your own best builds yk?
creations-chat 2023-04-04 13:40:40 and those things also arent the standart. Sadly the game nowadays just leaks of goodplayers cause rickje didnt do things like updates nh stuff what leaded to players quitting.
creations-chat 2023-04-04 13:45:06 bro you building a new mech everyday got a meme or sth?
creations-chat 2023-04-04 13:48:14 you aint a % better

creations-chat 2023-04-04 14:02:52 <@757887014388367401> idea how to make this?
creations-chat 2023-04-04 14:05:25 yes, there aint rly a block to use for that
creations-chat 2023-04-04 14:07:31 still roscale=best scale. Also its more challenging, what i like.
creations-chat 2023-04-04 14:09:34 i rly like your overscale cars tho!
creations-chat 2023-04-04 14:11:40 uwu<:clueless:942802644043464734>
creations-chat 2023-04-04 14:15:34 actually good idea
creations-chat 2023-04-04 14:48:35 cause:
creations-chat 2023-04-04 14:50:51 no, but i also downvoted so i just wanted to be a step ahead

creations-chat 2023-04-04 15:08:10 <@757887014388367401> i guess the best i can do. sadly its to short to be angeld
creations-chat 2023-04-04 15:35:42 IL-28?
creations-chat 2023-04-04 15:44:11 <@757887014388367401> i added your requests. New: Comander sight, gunner optics, mg hole next to cannon barrel, cage for spare parts nh other stuff. and somehow still no exposed lock
creations-chat 2023-04-04 16:18:12 do i rly need to tell you the obvious?
creations-chat 2023-04-04 16:33:15 yes thx for that idea! you like how the turret turned out?
creations-chat 2023-04-04 16:36:06 <@819249348407459860> make the camo smoother
creations-chat 2023-04-04 17:36:35 barrel can elevate, what to use that smoke pipe for  then? also i prefer using piston lock for that.
creations-chat 2023-04-04 17:44:11 already have a cupola now, even better
creations-chat 2023-04-04 19:54:50 small turret ring i have bin working on, insane what amount of detail piston lock gets you
creations-chat 2023-04-04 19:58:23 but what also annoys me is that on the pic you can see actually the only exposed motor on the whole thing
creations-chat 2023-04-04 20:00:37 i wouldnt count this as exposed cause its the bottom of the turret, wont be seen to often tbf
creations-chat 2023-04-05 06:08:14 thougts? <@757887014388367401>
creations-chat 2023-04-05 08:14:42 why roblox why
creations-chat 2023-04-05 10:16:40 sherlock. but its to short when angled
creations-chat 2023-04-05 11:38:56 i think you actually underscaled it
creations-chat 2023-04-05 14:58:55 what else would they be????<:clueless:942802644043464734>

creations-chat 2023-05-14 08:35:52 tip: use half cylinders 2 instead of half block wedges
creations-chat 2023-05-14 10:26:15 this
creations-chat 2023-05-15 19:57:51 anh bruhhh, you havent just said that, your f 14 aint close to the best one ðŸ’€
creations-chat 2023-05-16 11:29:02 the schmoothness on this thing is insane , crazy what half cylinders can do
creations-chat 2023-05-16 11:52:55 XD
creations-chat 2023-05-19 12:29:00 FIX YOUR GAME <@217336009455566848> i cant spawn any motorlocked buil without your game physics fucking up. if i try to angle lock, the motor just kina falls off and spawns back in place with its originall orientation. And sometimes, even worse things like this happens. Youre excusing with havbing problems and university life what so ever
creations-chat 2023-05-19 12:31:44 nah, i have like 10 Ping <@448677698773057547> ye <@690931622345834527> its  actually allowed to ping him,  just not spamming and i see A REALLY FUCKED UP GAME as an not unnesccary ping.
creations-chat 2023-05-19 12:33:58 Cam lock is dog shit, its just good on small things like 1 wide pvp fighters but for actuall ddetailed dbuilds its way to unaccurate, angle lock combined with piston lock is way better. And <@849139320106516491> him working on PC2 is the biggest lie in gaming history, its like you woul dsay EA aint P2W
creations-chat 2023-05-19 12:36:05 they are only saying that spamming gets you banned,  only pinged him once
creations-chat 2023-05-19 12:39:19 Yes its insane, iam on a good pc playing wiith full graphiics 60 fps yk? And still trying to spawn a big build in public makes my game even crash sometimes, or iam getting flinged into eternitys of space with over lightspeed.
creations-chat 2023-05-19 12:41:42 its plane crazy, the coding of plane crazy is so fucked up and hold together by diffrent glitches outglitching eachother that one single roblox update fires up the whole game.
