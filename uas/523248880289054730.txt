bug-reports 2018-12-20 19:49:02 Please fix the thrusters, they somethings just shut off for no reason and not making thrust even tho it's on. No it's not my computer because my computer is powerful and my ping is 70 ping on average. It just stops making thrust, I reported this a month or two before so maybe it's not fixable but i hope it is. It's a killer bug for drones.

bug-reports 2018-12-20 21:22:47 It says no messages found. When the glitch happens is it supposed to say something?
bug-reports 2018-12-20 21:26:11 I don't think i know how to use this. but i unchecked the output to get rid of the white messages. I have the console open when the glitch happens but it says nothing.
bug-reports 2018-12-20 21:32:20 The glitch is weirder now, the rocket is thrusting off and on when the rocket's thrust should be maxed(You can see the fire but it's just sitting there). It just comes back to life sometimes. My ping is only 100 which is not that bad and i had no lag spikes.
