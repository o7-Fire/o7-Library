I really love the design! Building a car in the game that can change gears was going to be my next project but I’m wondering if I should use it in a Toyota Camry or Corolla.
creations-chat 2021-05-17 22:00:45 If I see something that people put their best effort on, I’ll upvote it. If I see the opposite of that then I downvote it or just leave it. That is literally what the feedback system is there for. Out of 20,000 people, I’m not sure anybody is going to sit on their cheap office chair from staples downvoting everything they can everyday. I’m sorry for clogging the chat with this long paragraph.
