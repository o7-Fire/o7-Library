creations-chat 2020-10-19 21:08:44 rate my plane
creations-chat 2020-10-19 21:10:07 understandable
creations-chat 2020-10-19 21:12:14 yeah i understand that but when i put a propeller on the front using a motor and propeller blades it broke the balance of my plane somehow
creations-chat 2020-10-20 08:24:28 its annoying can we agree
the-dump 2020-11-23 23:17:21 definition of chaotic evil

bot-central 2020-11-23 23:22:22 amazing
creations-chat 2020-12-18 13:18:46 rate my carrier, go
creations-chat 2020-12-18 13:29:45 i was going for something like this but okay
creations-chat 2020-12-18 13:32:00 thank you, but yes i am going to try and fix the fact theres almost no wedges
creations-chat 2020-12-18 13:45:48 i understand ugleh but short?
creations-chat 2020-12-18 13:50:58 yea it is blocky also **slowmode**
creations-chat 2020-12-18 13:53:59 yes still blocky, im working on it
creations-chat 2020-12-18 13:58:12 tbh this community is really picky and if they dont think it had several hours of work and 7 years of prior experience on it you get a 3:1 downvote to upvote ratio


also just dont say about downvotes its like you provoke them to
creations-chat 2020-12-18 14:00:13 some of them, others are just like... would trolls be the word? idk
creations-chat 2020-12-18 14:03:15 i wasnt sure on the word and i still aint but trolls isnt the correct word
i think its just people who put their standards too high but i could be completely wrong
creations-chat 2020-12-18 14:06:13 exactly
ive put in hours of work then be forced to delete it because its been 1:10 ratioed
creations-chat 2020-12-18 14:25:10 the duality of this server
vvv we know
creations-chat 2020-12-18 14:28:52 i know, but when youve spent time on it and your really proud of it but then it gets 1:10 downvoted it crushes you and i know a few people who straight up didnt bother to play anymore because of it
creations-chat 2020-12-18 14:36:22 dont you see what im trying to say, the way that people downvote so mercilessly is literally breaking the community apart with new people being lost and not playing anymore due to nobody appreciating their effort, but meticulously finding flaws with their builds they were proud and happy with, and it really sucks when someone no longer plays anymore because of this community being so harsh to the newer players.
creations-chat 2020-12-18 14:47:33 theres a difference between advice and being mass downvoted

take it like this, theres a difference between getting an F on an essay without reasoning or feedback than there is getting an F with feedback and reasons, so you can improve upon it.
creations-chat 2020-12-18 14:49:50 its good for a starter plane, but i would say that the front is far too long tbh <@!694815305385377813>
creations-chat 2020-12-18 14:53:20 <@!694815305385377813> i would suggest moving the prop 1 block closer towards the cockpit, it looks too long when compared to a reference image

creations-chat 2020-12-23 21:02:54 nobody likes a self upvoter also the nose
creations-chat 2020-12-23 21:19:12 can you guys give me any ideas on how to improve this **very** early design, like its about 10% done
creations-chat 2020-12-23 21:23:15 <@456226577798135808>  i was thinking of doing that.

<@!781206492187590656> I haven't detailed it much so far, but i like the idea of rougher edges.
creations-chat 2020-12-23 21:26:16 he do be crying
creations-chat 2020-12-23 21:30:10 <@!781206492187590656> i see what you mean but there are also ships that have bridges, such as star destroyers i could add a secondary bridge tho
creations-chat 2020-12-23 21:35:04 <@!781206492187590656> your right but the way i built the front of the ship means i need an elevated position to actually get a view, u got a suggestion on what i could do?
