bug-reports 2023-04-09 07:43:19 <:nooo:787097964946259978>
bug-reports 2023-04-09 07:45:47 - freezing when i tries to un-anchor
- motorlock bug (the motorlock on the wing already locked anyway)
bug-reports 2023-04-09 07:47:39 the glitch started in 2:01, i already tried many ways to fix this from the inside and outside, but i stil cant find out why this glitch exist.
bug-reports 2023-04-09 07:49:19 will be still same
use physics or not the results will always be like this, i almost play 24 hours only to fix this.
bug-reports 2023-04-09 08:09:26 alr, look the result.
bug-reports 2023-04-09 08:14:15 so should i unpack into pieces again?
bug-reports 2023-04-09 08:14:19 i dont get this glitch when im created those wings or engine part, but this glitch just shows up after im making the rooms inside the ship.
bug-reports 2023-04-09 08:15:21 alr
bug-reports 2023-04-09 08:17:35 if it still a glitch on the ship i just can rebuild another one with similar stereotype but with nothing inside.
bug-reports 2023-04-09 08:18:30 it take few days or three weeks to make the whole body and took one month to make the rooms.
