creations-chat 2021-05-25 18:25:37 they look similar because theyre both based on the same thing
creations-chat 2021-05-25 18:29:31 i meant that they look similar cause theyre based on the same thing. just cause it coincidentally looks similar doesnt mean its copied
creations-chat 2021-05-25 18:31:54 Yeah, but it's also weird how some people see things the same way. As humans, its not uncommon to bump heads and do something the same way, but even so, its not copied just because there are some details that are similar.

help 2022-05-01 15:33:26 You could have a two block tall nose maybe
help 2022-05-01 15:33:36 Just two wedges on each other
help 2022-05-01 15:33:53 And then build around that
help 2022-05-01 15:35:41 You should make the top and bottom wedges half wedge down 2
help 2022-05-01 15:35:55 That should make the nose look flatter
