<@551806781609869313> custom
creations-chat 2021-03-21 23:47:16 Well, the gun isn't in the original position (45 degrees up) so it makes it longer

For the tail, I alr tried disconnectors, half blocks... And it makes it too thick or not thick enough..
creations-chat 2021-03-21 23:49:18 Well.. It would add much mass at the back but sure I could try
creations-chat 2021-03-22 00:10:06 Well, you can try using mix of sparklers, blocks, cylinders or signs (if you know how to motorlock you can make a custom barrel with special blocks inside of themselves
creations-chat 2021-03-23 11:40:11 wheeze
creations-chat 2021-03-23 12:34:05 Flaps hole can be filled easily, else the overall is pretty good

creations-chat 2021-03-26 12:00:52 Well proportions aren't really right, the kirov class is the heaviest battlecruiser ever made yet, a good scaled kirov would take 5 or 6 fold, lot of weapons are missing, the silos are way behind and there's many details missing, in the overall its a good work since the ship is quite hard to make, can be upgrade
creations-chat 2021-03-26 12:03:46 Well, it's honestly a really good Job that u've done yet, maybe try learning decorations skills, or motorlock/cameralock/pistonlock, the overall is still good tbh

creations-chat 2021-04-04 12:22:53 Honestly or not ?
creations-chat 2021-04-04 12:27:50 The carrier texture is too repetitive, the shape's also too squary and stubby, 

there's quite lot of details missing,
 the tower is way too flat, missing details also, there's random jet engines idk why are they here, there's a taxiway missin' (except if your basing it on WW2),

 As i said, quite lot details are missing which makes the ship looking amateur, superstructure also very block, idk about the hull, If i had to judge it i'd say it's a good amateur work, you can still upgrade or learn some detail/decoration skills
creations-chat 2021-04-04 12:31:12 ......Well tbh i cant say much cuz you'll learn by getting skills and playing the game, just continue playing the game and you'll understand what i'm talking about

help 2023-07-10 13:41:38 
help 2023-07-10 13:41:43 With a wingspan of 12m
help 2023-07-10 13:41:54 How much block would that be on ro-scale
help 2023-07-10 13:41:58 About 14 ?
help 2023-07-10 13:42:33 U sure ?
help 2023-07-10 13:43:00 Well i did my stuff with a friend of mine and, if the wingspan is 14 blocks, the AC must be about 32 width
help 2023-07-10 13:43:08 For ro-scale accuracy
help 2023-07-10 13:43:33 No but like, i'm questioning y'all
help 2023-07-10 13:51:32 Some people told me 1 block is approximately equal to 1m (or 0.90m)
help 2023-07-10 13:52:15 And some other says it's 2.5m
help 2023-07-10 13:53:17 Hm
help 2023-07-10 13:58:35 Hm alright good to know, so 27.5 blocks
help 2023-07-10 13:58:37 Thanks
help 2023-07-10 13:58:53 Wait Does 27.5 block sounds correct for a runway

help 2023-07-10 14:01:13 hm sure
help 2023-07-10 14:07:09 By the way dumb question but, did you anyhow use camera lock ?
help 2023-07-10 14:08:15 Alright so your ship is mainly made of custom angle and motorlock right?
help 2023-07-10 14:08:19 Including piston lock?
help 2023-07-10 14:08:36 Alright thank you
help 2023-07-10 14:09:53 I see
help 2023-07-10 14:10:09 So you basically recommend using Custom angle and motorlock
help 2023-07-10 14:10:18 Sorry for asking much question though
help 2023-07-10 14:10:30 Thanks a lot
help 2023-07-10 14:11:02 Also, 27.5 block width is perfect, as it somehow fits the average size of aircrafts ingame
help 2023-07-10 14:11:21 Yup
help 2023-07-10 14:11:24 Thanks for everything
help 2023-07-10 14:12:33 Facing an issue, the lenght
help 2023-07-10 14:12:49 239 block would mean i need about uh.. 5 folds ?
help 2023-07-10 14:12:54 Oh maybe
help 2023-07-10 14:13:00 Now that you say it
help 2023-07-10 14:13:26 So basically
help 2023-07-10 14:13:38 Hm
help 2023-07-10 14:14:07 
help 2023-07-10 14:14:09 As in like this ?

help 2023-07-10 14:15:23 hm
help 2023-07-10 14:15:31 then maybe 0.7 scale
help 2023-07-10 14:16:20 so 167 block long and 19.5 block width
help 2023-07-10 14:16:34 Lemme
