creations-chat 2022-10-28 18:22:49 this community is so overly negative for no reason lol, half the newbie-ish creations get downvoted to oblivion for no reason.  just don't upvote if you don't think something's worth it, or at least give constructive criticism. and these people actually go out of their way to insult someone for liking something they don't? man.
creations-chat 2022-10-28 18:28:21 yeah but everyone here thinks like a single-celled organism. no support for new people, no advice or any of that. just tell them they're bad at the game with a little red arrow and go on with your day. at least tell them what's wrong yk, but every time something sub-par gets posted in gallery chat 80+ people line up to downvote it with no care about helping anyone out
creations-chat 2022-10-28 18:32:16 some people want to show what they're capable of without digging through the help channel to perfect everything

<@448677698773057547> wasn't directed at you, if the slowmode wasn't so aggressive i already would've mentioned that it's cool of you to give some thoughts

<@456226577798135808> had this community not driven me away for these exact reasons many months ago, my name wouldn't be white lol. but yeah
creations-chat 2022-10-28 18:37:59 nice talk <#504436696021204992> hopefully you can appreciate that helping people isn't impossible if you dislike something of theirs (even if it's a newbie with a white name telling you this)
