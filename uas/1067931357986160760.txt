creations-chat 2023-04-06 01:15:55 I mean at least I post my builds instead of just shaming other people ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
creations-chat 2023-04-06 01:19:30 they don't have to be good, I just have to be happy about them,  I just wanted to know what other people thought about them, my fault i guess.

creations-chat 2023-04-15 23:14:09 Am I the only one who thinks planes where your arms are sticking out of the cockpit looks bad
creations-chat 2023-04-16 20:34:35 Its a game about blocks not a game about cylinders.
creations-chat 2023-04-16 20:36:52 which one?
creations-chat 2023-04-16 20:39:10 Its a DLC <:FineTroll:626841259746656289>

creations-chat 2023-04-16 21:00:04 Nice f-15
creations-chat 2023-04-21 13:47:37 Dont forget the 1 block wide cockpit.
creations-chat 2023-04-21 13:53:43 Also dont forget the giant motorlocked bombs on the bottom of the wings
creations-chat 2023-04-21 13:58:58 I make railguns
creations-chat 2023-04-29 15:55:42 People in creations chat talking bad about one exposed motor when their builds looking like the mirage 6900
creations-chat 2023-04-29 16:20:24 I also just dont put landing gears on some of my planes, of course later i add them but still
creations-chat 2023-04-29 16:30:00 If youre using regular landing gears you could cover it up with disconnecters, if its a custom gear you could use trapdoors as sort of a landing gear door or whatever its called
creations-chat 2023-05-02 23:50:51 Or flightpoint...
creations-chat 2023-05-02 23:53:14 Babft has crap physics
creations-chat 2023-05-05 22:34:39 wow cargo door so cool (ik the rest of the build is bad, i just wanted a build with a cargo door)
