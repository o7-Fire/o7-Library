bug-reports 2020-08-19 19:25:46 So just found this out while messing around with my jetski:
If water propellors are about to hit air and you leave the seat, **the water propellor will still keep on moving throughout the air like its water, not slowing down at all, rather, it gets faster.**

The small test I did had two projectiles with water propellors, one that releases normally, and another that releases as you leave the seat. Through some testing, I found out that all of the water propellors can achieve this except for the 5x5 because it cant provide enough force to leave the water.

bug-reports 2020-10-05 00:59:48 **Slight dizzy warning in the video included.**

I believe I may have found another new bug regarding cameras.

So basically, if you kill a camera (can only be done via explosive blocks/balls, lava **sources**, not lava spitters, and world border) and try to get back into it, **your third person camera's position and orientation will lock in place and cannot be moved until you press the camera button again.** Asides from this, if you try to exit the seat while locked, the camera angle is teleported to where players load in initially. Again, if you can somehow manage to get back into the seat and press the camera button, it will go back to normal.

The test I performed included two lights, one assigned to the camera button to show when I activate it, and another light assigned to my right click. Once the explosive blows up and the camera is sent flying, it will stop after a while, which is when the camera officially "dies." Afterwards, once that has happened, the bug is shown to occur.

creations-chat 2021-01-14 02:14:45 heres ice material to show that the scale isnt wack
creations-chat 2021-01-14 02:17:03 To be completely honest, the only reason I can come up with as to why that happens would be that the game in general became slower / more sluggish due to the fact that it had to load more reflections caused by the metal material

Otherwise, no clue + would like to see a flight demo of normal material heli as well
creations-chat 2021-01-14 02:21:41 yeah the only thing I can think come up with would probably be because the game needs to load more stuff and so the game gets slower / in phantom forces if you put on certain materials on skins it causes the game to get slower, so I’m just inferring it off of that too

heres a little setup on recreating the jittering
Increasing motor speed drastically increases the jittering, and adding ballast beams and anchor blocks remove the jittering entirely for most of the tests i did
Angles 90 degrees or below tend to jitter but stop once it reached its goal - stops faster on slower speeds
Angles above 90 degrees keep jittering
Lower torque makes jittering appear less often

~~alright, so, theres a handful of things that could be happening:~~
~~1) You aren't going fast enough, but I don't think thats the issue here~~
~~2) You aren't in pvp mode - could be possible, check~~
~~3) **You probably have anchor blocks in your build - if you have anchor blocks and you have cutters, the cutters are guaranteed not going to work.**~~

help 2021-03-19 08:40:01 if your plane pitches up insanely hard:
-increase the amount of wing panels in the back
-decrease the amount of wing panels in the front
-increase weight in the front
-decrease weight in the back

the plane is most likely pitching upwards due to having too much lift in the front, so these solutions should fix a large portion of the problem

help 2021-03-22 04:28:32 as for the treads, you did them spot on
pistons are fine for extending the wheels
help 2021-03-22 04:31:59 i mean the way i would do it would be to motorlock the wheels to the right, and then insert another wheel on the left from above
help 2021-03-22 04:32:22 theres probably a more efficient way of doing it but the way i do things are overcomplicated
help 2021-03-22 04:33:22 you're getting about 5 blocks of space which isn't the most helpful
help 2021-03-22 04:33:37 so unless you do something funky with pistons and motorlock on the wheels

help 2021-03-29 03:27:01 ik whats the problem
help 2021-03-29 03:27:04 im typing it out hold on
help 2021-03-29 03:35:40 So basically:
Whenever your wings are folded out, the center of lift and center of mass are matched up pretty well like this
help 2021-03-29 03:36:10 But when your wings are folded in, the wings in general move entirely back, and so their lift moves back too, like this
help 2021-03-29 03:36:36 because it was so perfectly balanced earlier, the lift moving back causes it to, instead of going straight, to pitching down
help 2021-03-29 03:38:02 as for that, i dont have much an idea as to deal with it except for just compensating for it while flying
help 2021-03-29 03:38:15 but thats the problem you're dealing with
help 2021-03-29 03:40:37 i mean a stupidly complicated way to do it would be to put pistons with ballasts on them in the fuselage so that whenever you fold in your wings, the CoM goes back with it so it still balances out
help 2021-03-29 03:41:30 or vice versa with wing panels on the pistons - when the wings fold in, the pistons move forwards so that the lift is still in front
help 2021-03-29 03:41:54 but that'd be horribly inefficient and too hard to perfect
help 2021-03-29 03:42:01 so i dont recommend that

help 2021-03-29 04:43:50 <@!459749464434016266> tbh the reason why variable-swept wing aircraft were made were so that they could reach and maintain faster velocities
so increasing the speed when folding the wings in would most likely compensate for the stall speed

nasa made a 48 page document regarding stall on swept wings, so you could read up on that if you want

Jimmy Carter is reported to be 1.77m tall while Joe Biden is 1.82m tall, but even if Carter had grown shorter in old age, the photo would suggest that Biden is taller than Carter by much more than five centimeters.

help 2021-05-21 01:57:55 1) what does your tank look like
we cant really give accurate feedback without knowing the general size of the tank

2) what kind of treads: fake or actual treads?
and if you're going with actual treads, normal treads or thin treads?
help 2021-05-21 02:04:19 one block treads are normal treads

these treads are the thin variant
help 2021-05-21 02:05:46 thin treads can only go down to a minimum of two blocks wide
help 2021-05-21 02:07:59 you could go down to one block wide if you really wanted to, but it would be really clunky and probably wouldnt work well with the size of your sherman
so again a minimum of two blocks wide

help 2021-05-21 02:10:03 the one block wide version isnt really one block wide, but its like 1.2 blocks wide
you'd need to use texts or signs, and from what i know there kinda isnt a one block wide tread that exists yet

if anything, just always have a low self-esteem
either you're right or you'd be pleasantly surprised
having your own standards are good
but when you see that people aren't liking your build
you should try and maybe reaching out and asking what part of it they didn't like
so that you can further improve

help 2021-07-08 13:16:36 right now
help 2021-07-08 18:55:16 so basically if your plane keeps going down:

- Increase the amount of wing panels in the front
- Decrease the amount of wing panels in the back
- Increase weight in the back
- Decrease weight in the front

The plane is most likely pitching downwards due to having too much lift in the back, so these solutions should fix a large portion of the problem.

help 2021-07-26 02:44:22 so basically theres an option on pistons called Lock
if you enable it, the arm becomes completely rigid when its extended
so you can use it for motorlocked builds and the blocks stay in the extended position without spazzing out
big tip is to let the arm sit for a little bit before locking the build, otherwise theres a chance that the lock wont work
help 2021-07-26 02:47:42 think of it as motorlocking, except you're extending instead of retracting and you can finely adjust how much the block moves

creations-chat 2021-07-28 08:57:53 it acts as a normal angle lock
creations-chat 2021-07-28 08:59:56 yeah
when you're moving the motor2, the locked motor is freely moving bc of the 0 torque
but once you release the motor2, it angle locks
so basically you can angle it perfectly and it doesnt spaz out

im guessing you're referring to the shape of the pieces

its just four pieces being clamped horizontally and vertically

if i were to say something about your build, i would probably say to either shorten/widen the creation
it seems abnormally long, and so the proportions dont feel right

basically just make it have proper proportions

was a good game
creations-chat 2021-08-12 08:36:42 robocraft was still good 2018-2019
i came back to it like mid 2020 and it was too different with the power system or something
creations-chat 2021-08-12 08:40:06 i joined after seats became cosmetics
i just remember making healing hovers
good days
creations-chat 2021-08-12 08:43:03 yeah plane crazy is pretty much the sandbox version more suited for just making vehicles
robocraft and besiege were pretty much the only reasons i came to plane crazy since they just seemed similar
creations-chat 2021-08-12 08:46:21 <:KEKW:670310537300672528>

honestly my first impression of plane crazy was "wow this is just a shitty version of besiege" and then just left 
came back to it a few months later and it wasnt as bad as i remembered
making wack stuff in besiege was fun
then modding got out of hand
creations-chat 2021-08-12 08:49:35 besiege still has the upper hand in terms of blocks tbh
theyve got hinges and braces and freeform blocks now 
makes building so much easier but so much more in depth
creations-chat 2021-08-12 08:52:18 now that i remember they added blocks for automation too
range-based detectors, height detectors, angle detectors, and just AND gates and OR gates and stuff

this is the freeform block
you can curve it and stuff so its hella useful for smooth surfaces

- remove weight in the front / add weight in the back
- use custom control surfaces

was actually kinda confusing
creations-chat 2021-09-22 03:23:23 hes just utilizing the suspension gyro thing
i think
forcefully bend suspension so it can spin crafts fast if done right

if im reading this right, it says
"[x=3, y=4, z=10] Turned into [x=3, y=3, z=6]"
creations-chat 2021-09-22 03:29:55 he's minimizing it, according to the caption above it
~~if you kinda just vaguely look at the image, the mechanism itself is also kinda getting smaller so the numbers are probably getting smaller~~

wait wait

yeah might be closer to 8, but i still think its 6
using the green blob as a guide, the green takes up like 1/10 of the length, if not a little bit more
and then in the second pic, the entire thing basically shrinks to half its original size
so theres probably a bit of space for guessing

should make photos a tiny bit cleaner

creations-chat 2021-11-03 00:42:46 <@!582639638397845514> how does that even fly
the only thing i could imagine it doing is just flips because of the delta wing panels

creations-chat 2021-11-03 04:15:07 are the motor2's on mouse control?
or rather what settings do they have
creations-chat 2021-11-03 04:26:02 theres still no way that thing doesnt flip over, let alone hover
theres drag on one end and there lift on another, so it'd just rapid flip around where the delta wings would be
angling the motor2s in a way where the thing wouldnt make it spin wouldnt make it even lift at all
creations-chat 2021-11-03 04:30:27 are you telling me that it doesnt actually fly
creations-chat 2021-11-03 04:36:37 pictures dont help when it comes into seeing that something is flying __under control__

i could give you this photo and say its flying
meanwhile its actually plummeting to its death because it doesnt have any actual wings 

also on that note, your craft is going a considerable 60 sps in one of the photos
which means that you had to have taken it when it was midflight, not even in hovering
creations-chat 2021-11-03 04:39:52 what im saying is that a video would be preferred
because theres the option of using the flip button into the air and quickly getting your mouse off it and drop it to make it "fly"

help 2021-11-09 22:39:08 piston lock basically locks the piston head in place if you let it sit for some time after extending the head, letting you motor lock it into stuff and not screw over

really good for small adjustments, since it isnt restricted to only a certain amount, like how locked motors can only move half a block

can be used to make blocks run flush with others after anglelocking, or just making blocks go flush in general

otherwise its pretty good for mechanisms that require fine tuning too

help 2021-11-25 16:12:01 as a result of the rear wing panels + tail rotor, theres a lot of drag in the back
thats why at 0:13, when the rear wing panels were pointing up, it flew a bit smoother
at least vertically it did

increasing weight in the front isnt going to be much help
think about weight once it can take off and you're trying to level it when you're moving forwards/backwards

to fix it, you should switch out the tail rotor propellor blades to control surfaces 
and then either:
- decrease the amount of wing panels in the back
- add additional wing panels towards the front
- just point the wing panels in the back completely up before you take off / move vertically

the wing panels in the back are going to help once you get forwards/backwards/sideways movement
but for now, they're causing the whole thing to capsize

another reason to switch out the tail rotor propellor blades to control surfaces is so that it doesnt rotate the body when flying up and down
im pretty sure thats the reason why the whole thing started to roll over at 0:13, when the craft was moving forwards
if you had control surfaces, there wouldnt be any forces like that on the heli so it should become stable
help 2021-11-25 17:17:41 are the control surfaces set to keybinds instead of "Set Controls Automatically"?
help 2021-11-25 17:17:54 i think they arent
help 2021-11-25 17:18:01 since the camera locked in the beginning
help 2021-11-25 17:18:10 usually that happens with control surfaces with default settings
help 2021-11-25 17:19:40 so that means the "Set Controls Automatically" setting is on?
help 2021-11-25 17:19:55 oh
help 2021-11-25 17:20:11 so keybinds are set to left and right keys?
help 2021-11-25 17:20:15 or whatever you're using
help 2021-11-25 17:21:48 thats just an issue with roblox's chat filter
help 2021-11-25 17:25:13 now that i think about it, you might want to have the tail rotor set to toggle and set it to a key that you just press once
and then keep the keybinds for the control surfaces

if you kept the tail rotor settings the same as before with the propellor blades, then it might be messing it up

otherwise, the control surfaces just might lack power
help 2021-11-25 17:26:14 also
help 2021-11-25 17:26:14 wait
help 2021-11-25 17:26:28 you should only use the tail rotor for turning when you're hovering
help 2021-11-25 17:26:44 or else you're gonna run into the same issue of rolling over as you were with the propellor blades
help 2021-11-25 17:26:58 and then maybe add a vertical stab in the back for turning forwards
help 2021-11-25 17:27:32 there might be a way to bypass it
but i havent really messed around with emojies that much
help 2021-11-25 17:27:38 so i cant really give insight
help 2021-11-25 17:30:22 just turn on the toggle setting on the motor
press a key once and itll keep spinning

help 2021-11-25 17:49:56 okay just noticed a couple of things:

for the main rotor, doing the 40 speed on the top motor and 20 speed on bottom motor works, but you shouldnt do that
make it so the top motor is 50 speed and the bottom motor is unpowered
that way it both counters the torque and distributes the power evenly

second note
you shouldnt set the same keybinds for both the forwards and backwards
or else you wont able to stop it and its going to be finnicky trying to get it to spin the way you want it 
just set the keybind you want to either forwards or backwards
and then a key you'll never use to the other

lastly
if you want to turn with the tail rotor, you're gonna need to put keybinds on there
not sure if leaving it empty like that was intentional or not
but just noting it here in case

bug-reports 2022-01-01 23:27:00 found a funny bug regarding the water propellor

if you have either a **water propellor 2x3 or 2x5** (the two water propellors that dont have casings and are decently large) directly attached to a **locked** piston, anything thats attached to the water propellor will spin around it
bug-reports 2022-01-01 23:27:13 im 110% sure that this is useful for something, cant immediately think of anything
bug-reports 2022-01-01 23:27:24 was able to put it on a stand
bug-reports 2022-01-01 23:42:12 doesnt have a whole lot of torque
bug-reports 2022-01-01 23:51:05 putting at least 9 propellor blades on the thing without anything else makes it go light speed
bug-reports 2022-01-01 23:51:27 but then 90% of the time crashes roblox
bug-reports 2022-01-01 23:52:04 not even sure if the propellor blades are what make it go fast
might be just related to the physics that comes with it

bug-reports 2022-01-02 02:26:33 used it in another build before
bug-reports 2022-01-02 02:54:56 okay so it kinda not so really works
bug-reports 2022-01-02 02:55:59 wdym
bug-reports 2022-01-02 02:56:00 just like
bug-reports 2022-01-02 02:56:06 put propellors on the thing?
bug-reports 2022-01-02 02:56:26 right
bug-reports 2022-01-02 02:57:00 this is what i found pretty early on
bug-reports 2022-01-02 02:57:59 hold on
bug-reports 2022-01-02 02:58:11 ill just make it and post a video so people actually get the memo that it kinda break
bug-reports 2022-01-02 02:58:12 s
bug-reports 2022-01-02 02:59:39 yeah that works too but with the locked piston it works even better
bug-reports 2022-01-02 02:59:44 <:lmfao:527971550360633393>
bug-reports 2022-01-02 03:00:09 i mean
bug-reports 2022-01-02 03:00:12 okay first thing
bug-reports 2022-01-02 03:00:13 wait
bug-reports 2022-01-02 03:00:14 wait
bug-reports 2022-01-02 03:00:16 i found that
bug-reports 2022-01-02 03:00:25 if you have 2 or more on a single craft
bug-reports 2022-01-02 03:00:30 only one works
bug-reports 2022-01-02 03:00:37 basically it spins around only one propellor
bug-reports 2022-01-02 03:00:44 <@!251880826386513924> so reaction wheels wont really work
bug-reports 2022-01-02 03:00:55 not sure
bug-reports 2022-01-02 03:01:04 maybe the one that locks faster by a few milliseconds
bug-reports 2022-01-02 03:01:15 because they're on the same keybind
bug-reports 2022-01-02 03:02:11 probably
bug-reports 2022-01-02 03:03:07 the other water propellor bug i found like half a year ago is way more useful
bug-reports 2022-01-02 03:03:39 no one really saw it and no one really considered it <:lmfao:527971550360633393>
bug-reports 2022-01-02 03:04:25 made plane crazy's first water propellor powered plane <:KEKW:670310537300672528>
bug-reports 2022-01-02 03:04:57 the one i just linked?
bug-reports 2022-01-02 03:05:03 it takes a bit of preparation
bug-reports 2022-01-02 03:05:08 because you need to get into water
bug-reports 2022-01-02 03:05:15 and then jump out of the seat before you get out of the water
bug-reports 2022-01-02 03:05:19 then you reach hyperspeed
bug-reports 2022-01-02 03:05:36 oh?
bug-reports 2022-01-02 03:05:58 also heres the thing with propellors so people can actually understand that it kinda doesnt work
bug-reports 2022-01-02 03:06:31 then it doesnt move at all
bug-reports 2022-01-02 03:06:56 does it?
bug-reports 2022-01-02 03:07:00 thats the one i didnt try
bug-reports 2022-01-02 03:07:05 because its evenly spaced
bug-reports 2022-01-02 03:07:23 yeah id guess it work
bug-reports 2022-01-02 03:07:28 since it matches the criteria
bug-reports 2022-01-02 03:07:35 non cased, semi-large
bug-reports 2022-01-02 03:10:09 yeah its either it doesnt work at all or breaks the craft
bug-reports 2022-01-02 03:10:12 there is no in between
bug-reports 2022-01-02 03:10:17 at least from what ive found with it so far
bug-reports 2022-01-02 03:11:18 im pretty sure the reason why stand-alone water propellors work is because it wants to spin, but the hitbox extends out where it tries the spin the block its attached to
bug-reports 2022-01-02 03:11:54 still not sure why the locked piston happens tho
bug-reports 2022-01-02 03:12:52 yeah just figured that out

bug-reports 2022-01-15 21:38:57 <@!406887792015048715> 
basically in both of your issues, you need to remember that weld points are stupid
disconnectors still connect to blocks on all 6 sides
the only weld point that can detaches from the disconnector is on the side that has the smaller end of the disconnector

disconnecting side is labeled green in the video
bug-reports 2022-01-15 21:39:01 in the third video, the issue was that the disconnector was connecting both the booster and the main craft together via the half block above and below it
so basically you just needed to flip around the disconnector and it would work
bug-reports 2022-01-15 21:39:20 meanwhile in the first video you posted, the trapdoor was connected to the disconnector above it
the weld point on the trapdoor is on three edges, labeled green in the video
bug-reports 2022-01-15 21:39:27 basically, the trapdoor was connected on the non-disconnecting side of the disconnector above it 
if you wanted to keep it as a trapdoor, you just need to flip the trapdoor so that it connects to the booster, and not to the disconnector
bug-reports 2022-01-15 21:43:36 in the second video, basically the same thing, except that it was connected to a half block
half blocks still have weld points on all sides except for the one thats obviously missing
bug-reports 2022-01-15 21:44:06 tl;dr

weld points are stupid
even if it isnt visually connecting, theres a good chance that it is connecting
bug-reports 2022-01-15 22:40:16 they're just stupid in the sense that people that try to make stuff visually need to work around them if they want to add a little bit of stuff in like how he did it with disconnectors

otherwise yeah weld points are damn good if used properly

bug-reports 2022-01-18 00:45:38 what happens if you:
1) got into the camera
2) get out of the camera
3) press f
bug-reports 2022-01-18 00:46:07 aight
bug-reports 2022-01-18 00:51:06 this is just gonna take a lot of experimentation as to what exactly makes it kill itself
bug-reports 2022-01-18 00:51:13 the blocks are getting destroyed somehow
bug-reports 2022-01-18 00:51:20 since they're decaying
bug-reports 2022-01-18 00:51:40 and the camera block itself is breaking in the midst of that
bug-reports 2022-01-18 00:52:04 if you destroy a camera and/or get out of the seat whilst in a camera, the viewpoint orbits around the camera block as if it were the player
bug-reports 2022-01-18 00:52:37 aight
bug-reports 2022-01-18 00:53:15 what happens if you 
1) get in camera
2) get out
3) get in
4) press f
bug-reports 2022-01-18 00:55:28 weird
bug-reports 2022-01-18 00:55:35 so it doesnt kill itself?
bug-reports 2022-01-18 00:56:42 <@456226577798135808> what are the settings on your explosives
bug-reports 2022-01-18 00:56:51 yeah ofc it wouldnt die in nonpvp
bug-reports 2022-01-18 00:56:56 the blocks themselves are getting destroyed
bug-reports 2022-01-18 00:57:12 try setting them all to Ignore Self
bug-reports 2022-01-18 00:58:13 it doesnt die?
bug-reports 2022-01-18 00:58:50 im assuming your Impact speed is like 5 or something extra low
bug-reports 2022-01-18 00:59:19 oh
bug-reports 2022-01-18 00:59:20 hmmrg
bug-reports 2022-01-18 00:59:22 well either way
bug-reports 2022-01-18 00:59:33 pressing the camera causes something to move and thus come into contact with the explosives
bug-reports 2022-01-18 00:59:38 is what i think is happening
bug-reports 2022-01-18 00:59:58 because Ignore Self causes it to not explode upon contact with your own creation

hopefully the trails on attached to the blades hide once you have all of them on
also works with all 4 blades on the 0.9 block

from the looks of things you have like 20 blades, with 5 sets of 4 blades
so you can have one set thats solid, and the four others with the configuration that i posted, with the angles set at 18, 36, 54, and 72

or you could make 5 sets with angles set at 18, 36, 54, 72, and 90

bug-reports 2022-06-21 03:01:38 im like 90% sure thats only happening because of that specific setup

physics anchor blocks directly on the plot tend to bug out, and so they somehow provide a torque that goes throughout whatevers attached on them

so if you lifted that entire setup up a block, that wouldnt happen

the-dump 2022-06-21 04:15:35 ```guidelines to making a creation that doesnt get killed in #creations
```
• making something that has like 5+ results in <#384025409945337856> is not a good idea
   - disregard if you're confident that your build outclasses them entirely

• have a good color scheme
   - nothing cancerously vibrant and out of place
   - ask in <#384021699466756107> or <#478584971670454284> or <#504436696021204992> if you're not really sure
   - if its based on something, you should try making it close to it as you can to that
   - optional if your creation is mechanical

• irl stuff should be avoided, but
   - disregard if you're good at building, otherwise people that are critical will downvote at the slightest fucking detail
   - not a bad idea if you're able to tolerate a little stabbing and want to get better at building 

• custom stuff is okay, but
   - kinda hard to judge since theres nothing really to compare it to
      • also a good thing, cant get pestered over really small details
   - doesnt mean that you can make it cringe

• mechanical stuff is cool, but 
   - if replicating something from irl, make it as similar as possible instead of something that just "looks like it"
      • if you can't, making your own solution is the next best thing

• pixel art is good most of the time
   - anime and other cringe topics should be avoided
      • minecraft is counted most of the time since its overdone
   - size matters (kinda)

• memey stuff is good, but
   - nothing thats stale + overdone + cringe

• good looking builds that are mechanical are * *chefs kiss* *

• otherwise, just see what gets murdered in <#384025409945337856> and dont do what they did

• if you make a tutorial build and call it your own you're fucking stupid
   - they will find you

help 2022-07-07 00:27:33 you’ll need another subset of motors that keep all the motors at the same rotated position

help 2022-07-28 04:27:46 most of the wing panels are located at the back of the plane and thats what makes the blue dot so far back
meanwhile the yellow dot sits in the middle of the plane since there isnt much of a difference in the front than in the front

if you want to match the blue dot to the yellow dot, then you could maybe try adding ballast blocks to the back of the plane and increasing its weight so the yellow dot is closer to the blue dot

otherwise, you cant really move the blue dot unless you move the entire wing itself, or make it bigger, which im assuming you wouldnt want to do since that'd mess up the look of your plane

bug-reports 2022-07-30 03:12:10 powered locked motors have a tendency to "relock" if spun at high speeds, albeit being inconsistent with the length of contraction and position relative to the base of the motor
the faster the rotation, the more likely and drastic the outcome will be
the moving portion of the motor (whichever end that isnt attached to the spinning part) tends to move towards the center of the rotation, and so orientation of the locked motor doesnt really affect the bug
the settings for the locked motors dont matter either, having it set to 0 speed and/or torque doesnt affect it
sometimes the motors do "relock" outwards from rotation, but more often than not they move inwards

probably just locked motors being funny again

regarding the rotation of the individual rollers, you should try to use locked powered motors instead of motor 2s to rotate them the proper orientation
sure it isnt as easy, but in the long run it'll be a lot more stable since they wont misalign
otherwise you can try to use a combination of both motor2 and locked powered motors but imo just having locked powered motors is a simpler solution
