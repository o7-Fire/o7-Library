creations-chat 2022-05-02 10:55:30 why am I the most hated person in the world. I abused my dog and I get insulted. I cry every night because of the dark and I get insulted. I commit genocide and I get convicted. I commit war crimes in Bosnia and I get convicted. I cry every night hoping I can end it right now. But all I can do is accept the world I live in and hug my body pillow next to me. Life is short and not going great. And never will. But that's life.

help 2022-05-04 15:37:13 First you learn how to type in correct English grammar and spelling
help 2022-05-04 15:37:46 Then you use excess amounts of wings and ballast blocks to balance and stabilize the helicopter
creations-chat 2022-05-04 16:13:04 That and shipwright
Only real roles are vtol, robotics, land and air roles
creations-chat 2022-05-04 16:15:47 Shipwright is one of the easiest roles to get
You literally just make a giant floating boat that meets the block requirement up until shipwright V, when you have to actually make it look good
And then you just need a positive 20 ratio

If you want proof of how easy it is to get, look at how many people have shipwright
creations-chat 2022-05-04 16:17:32 If you know what your doing, no
But otherwise yes it's the hardest

creations-chat 2022-05-04 17:41:02 Well then here's some real feedback 

Cockpit is terrible
Nose reminds me of a pencil
Wings are too short
Fuselage does not change shape
Very little design or skill put into detailing
Literally no redeemable qualites of this "jet"
Please delete and watch fireyoblivion tutorials
creations-chat 2022-05-04 17:44:15 Literally no hope for this "jet" every part looks terrible and it looks like it's the first thing to get shot down in pvp battles
creations-chat 2022-05-04 17:45:58 For comparison this is my pvp jet that I literally only designed for pvp
Still hasn't been shot down and I built it in 1 hour
creations-chat 2022-05-04 17:57:22 Poorly done gradient, weird wing design with wing gaps, odd exposed engines minimalist tail front looks like a bird and the speed is pitiful.

Yes

creations-chat 2022-05-05 16:31:33 Also yeah he's either 13 or 11 tbh the way he talks he's trying to be sneaky about his identity

It's simple; you didn't clearly state your age and your trying to avoid the topic because your afraid of revealing that your a squeaky little boy
creations-chat 2022-05-05 16:33:43 I'm pretty sure he hasn't even hit puberty 💀

creations-chat 2022-05-06 01:17:48 *or you could just not use crutch words like "you guys" and just go "you"* but I find "you guys" a bit more formal

creations-chat 2022-05-06 12:32:54 Bruh if I showed off my old helicopters I would get downvoted to oblivion
creations-chat 2022-05-06 12:35:22 It's poor quality, wrong design, front is a nightmare, impossible rotor configuration thanks to hover drives, too short, did I say the front is a nightmare because it's giving me nightmares. No sliding door no detail doesn't even look like a pavehawk and the whole thing is just disgusting
AND BLACKHAWK VARIANT ROTORS ARE STRAIGHT FFS
The tail makes me want to vomit the design and quality overall is not deserving of the ratio

*Don't fuck with the helicopter guy*
creations-chat 2022-05-06 12:38:41 DOES THIS LOOK LIKE THIS

*Fucking didn't even put it on the right side*

creations-chat 2022-05-06 13:28:26 The curve needs to be more pronounced
As in, steeper angle downward while smoothing out in the fuselage

creations-chat 2022-05-07 23:30:05 Clearly you haven't been here for longer than three seconds so here's a little rundown on how this place works; creations feedback 97% of the time is the place where people insult the mass amount of shitty noob builds (like yours) created by whitenames primarily (people like you without any skill proven by roles). Your lucky people worse than me weren't here because they can actually put effort into they're insults of your poo fard build.

*I hate how I have to explain this because it should be obvious*
creations-chat 2022-05-07 23:31:49 Well ysee I'm a harsh critic

creations-chat 2022-05-08 23:24:20 When will you people realize... Plane crazy 2 WILL NEVER EXIST
It's all a hoax to make us keep playing this game in the hopes that one day, we will have a clipping tool, one day we will have water physics, one day we'll have an infinite map. It's all too good to be true

It's all a trick to boost sales for Roblox sponsored nerf guns
HASBRO IS BEHIND ALL OF THIS
creations-chat 2022-05-09 00:08:50 *not really it's just a pink blob*
creations-chat 2022-05-09 00:13:18 It kinda lacks detail and a good paint job
The back is really weird and is symmetrical on all sides unlike the craft itself, and it doesn't really have any features that stand out or make it interesting
No exterior parts or by the looks of it useful motorlocking
creations-chat 2022-05-09 00:15:12 I also doubt the ship is scale or even has an interior
It's just... Bland
creations-chat 2022-05-09 00:16:53 Ngl that's when I would be impressed a scale starship would be worth my upvote, even in it's current low detail state

Also get a tri rotor and go monoaxial if your gonna have hover drives running the damn props
Hell the whole rotor is just fucked entirely up and looks like ass
creations-chat 2022-05-12 11:10:30 Just why would make it coaxial when it's already got exterior propulsion of the rotors?!?
Also base design is off and cockpit has more glass
Also wait did this dude put a helium block on top of the already annoyingly oversized coaxial rotors which should have provided enough thrust to begin with to move the damn thing up and be stable-
creations-chat 2022-05-12 11:15:07 Just wtf bro this R-4 is sad a disgrace to Sikorsky

First off 
Delete the save file
Use a reference picture make it much smaller actually follow the reference picture especially on the wing sizes and use motorlock and angle locking to conceal ugly motors that are currently being used to angle the wings, then it should be somewhat good

creations-chat 2022-05-13 21:41:48 Then why aren't they angled
Also irl F-14s don't have angled wings sideways
They straight
creations-chat 2022-05-13 23:27:08 "Made for pvp" is just an excuse for something to be shitty and low effort
Bruh im just pointing it out literally every plane that says made for pvp is garbage
And the upvotes support that
creations-chat 2022-05-13 23:30:36 Creations have good builds challenge (99.99997% impossible) (only at 3am) (roblos) (😳 😳 😳 )
creations-chat 2022-05-13 23:32:52 No rules are the best rules
However that means there's no rule stopping me from making rules 
Neither does that mean any rules apply including those of gravity and of the universe
No rules also means that there can always be rules seeing as time and space obey rules
No rules = all rules

Meaning that I should make racism the law😎
creations-chat 2022-05-13 23:35:44 When is the racism championship gonna start I only lost last year to that guy that started all of those blm protests

creations-chat 2022-05-14 15:38:50 Pretty bland
Detail is where the gold is at

Even off the production line it had depth
creations-chat 2022-05-14 15:41:01 Very generic and low quality too it literally looks like a drawing
Needs depth
Also better tracks
creations-chat 2022-05-14 15:42:42 Frontal plate is slightly longer no machine guns at all literally blocky and basic

***It needs detail***
Also the back of the turret is wrong there shouldnt be a gap there
creations-chat 2022-05-14 15:47:09 This bs right here

creations-chat 2022-05-15 12:38:45 That's actually the main way you can tell
Using lazy grammar and poor spelling, shortened slang words like "u" and b4, and other lazy ways of typing
creations-chat 2022-05-15 12:40:44 True, but people who type English as their second language don't normally use English slang 💀
creations-chat 2022-05-15 12:42:25 Possible, but unlikely. It's harder to learn slang and in the end you only sound stupid to everyone else

creations-chat 2022-05-15 23:50:57 I think the amount of terrible builds in creations must have lowered people's standards
creations-chat 2022-05-15 23:53:10 Oh no
It's the revolution of whitenames
They're gonna overthrow the borgouise and create a system where there is no social hierarchy or class and base everything off of collectivism and call it a republic even though it's clearly a dictatorship!

creations-chat 2022-05-15 23:56:41 Fuck then they'll start censoring speech and do a mass ban of possible traitors out of paranoia of revolt

creations-chat 2022-05-16 10:57:39 Looks like a banana that was painted red and used a cheese grater as wings
I suggest you go for a different design entirely
creations-chat 2022-05-16 11:08:54 <@743080739972710492> pretty ok stallion but it lacks finer detail and engines the 5 rotors section is very clunky and I doubt it's stable mid-air if you use the blades to increase height, the paint is very bright and too revealing of how little detail or effort put into the actual design
Also the landing gear is poo fard the cockpit and there should be 7 rotors
creations-chat 2022-05-16 11:11:44 Bruh wtf are you talking about he didn't even add the engine
creations-chat 2022-05-16 11:13:31 Yeah i tried to edit it but my wifi went caput for a couple of minutes

Your boat is also equally poo fard
creations-chat 2022-05-18 22:27:13 I said it looks like it's about to fall apart
The thing looks like a flying trash can the colors are uninspired the shape of the actual plane is way off from whatever this is and the wings are literal barf

Just mad<:trollface:775024642104229898>
creations-chat 2022-05-19 13:34:05 Ysee it's something called physics
Ya need some sort of countertorque otherwise the craft will go in the direction the rotor is spinning
So either make it coaxial with another rotor going the opposite direction or stick rockets on it to propel the rotor instead of a normal motor
I suggest watching fireyoblivion's helicopter basics tutorials
creations-chat 2022-05-19 13:37:11 Bruh I just said that
creations-chat 2022-05-19 13:39:09 Nononono
For one that pulls the craft in the direction of the conveyor drive WHILE rotating the rotor making it uncontrollable
Another is that it's an eyesore and it's really clunky and big on the rotor
creations-chat 2022-05-19 13:41:16 Bruh you got two of the rockets spinning in the wrong direction

creations-chat 2022-05-19 16:42:19 Bruh everyone knows that when you say "based off of" it literally just means you failed to recreate what your "custom" plane is based on
creations-chat 2022-05-19 16:44:39 Idfk it's a pretty broad claim 
Im pretty sure with a combination of delta wings and conveyor drives you can make a plane go as fast as you would like it
also wtf why do you need 7 alt accounts for fucking roblox

creations-chat 2022-05-24 21:32:34 Or you could just judge the build yourself
Not everything has to be dependent on others yknow
You could just look at the build and go "yeah, that looks cool, and I probably couldn't recreate it, so I'll upvote"
But downvoting for no reason other than that everyone else upvoted is petty and makes you seem like an edgelord

creations-chat 2022-05-29 00:31:13 *well duh its missing a tail and any function of a helicopter*
well in order to make it have six rotors it has to have motorlock on the rotor itself so i put that there as a stand in so i could effectively motorlock around the rotating shaft
creations-chat 2022-05-29 00:33:33 the rotor will be complete tommorrow

creations-chat 2022-06-02 01:32:24 Like bruh use a guided cluster missile or a jet with the invisibility glitch on or hell even a tnt shotgun would work
Kamikaze builds, submarines, a lot works
You could just, y'know, put in effort 💀

creations-chat 2022-06-02 01:41:34 Introducing my anti shredder flak gun
Essentially it has a shit ton of magnets and tnt clustered together and it fills up the sky as well as lags the whole game, and anything caught in it's blast is destroyed
*Only used for minor amounts of trolling*
I'm away from the computer but in exactly 8 hours I'll have more pictures <@578603895736238100>
Essentially it's just a lot of motorlocked tnt
creations-chat 2022-06-02 01:43:42 I added a barrel to it but other than that it's the same
It uses all 150 blocks
And 300 ish trails 2 on each tnt
It was intended to crash the game but it works against shredders too
True<:trollface:775024642104229898>
creations-chat 2022-06-02 01:45:46 I don't have any images of it firing sadly but I have a new concept where I put headless pistons on it

Hasn't been fully tested but I know for a fact it will crash my game
*Your right*
Found out that exploding headless pistons can end up really fucking the game so attaching them to explosives and then firing is super lethal
the-dump 2022-06-02 01:48:45 So real!

FOR FIVE MINUTES
creations-chat 2022-06-05 13:41:18 Ffs we need to prevent whitenames from posting 
Maybe a quality check or skill check before they post or at least some filter to prevent the copious amounts of regurgitated shit in creations

creations-chat 2022-06-05 20:19:03 We need active moderators here to fix this crap
Rbk only bothers to look at this channel because he knows it's free modlogs
98% of the time it's arguments centered around low effort builds and whitenames being stupid
creations-chat 2022-06-05 20:21:27 Standards are shifting too because of it

creations-chat 2022-06-05 20:31:19 Yeah but I think there are ways to solve the low effort shit, and I think we do it already naturally by insulting and bullying sort of those who are the low effort failures
Essentially it makes them want to prove us wrong and they get better and build better
Maybe there should be a separate channel for people with ranks
creations-chat 2022-06-05 20:41:38 Yeah suggest that

creations-chat 2022-06-23 20:26:52 Bushnoises states in 3rd person referring to how he has been forgotten in this world of digital sandbox games. Realizing his insignificance he looks out from his window. His apartment is so small, yet high enough to see the tops of all the trees in the park. He thought to himself, the scary thought of jumping. Like a cancer the idea spread throughout him. Without him realizing he got up and opened the window, and stared down to the ground, impossibly high suddenly. He stares, pondering his fate. He backs away as he stares at the dead screen. Forgotten in the world, but maybe not here. He closes the window, the computer, and exits the door of his room for the first time in months. Countless stacks of GrubHub boxes border his line to the door. He opens, and finally, feels the sunlight for the first time in months. He stands, waiting for the next command.

the-dump 2022-06-24 02:43:32 Primarily because it takes 30 years to get a full game, 20% of people leave (always on my team) at the beginning, and when I get a full game my teammates are stupid or I lose to Russian chess masters who have dedicated their lives to strategy and not talking on the chat except for in broken English, and my teammates don't look at the chat and afk for the rest of the game, and then halfway through half the people leave and it's just a 2v2 and then everyone else leaves and the server dies
