help 2023-04-20 11:03:35 i think you just have too many wing panels
help 2023-04-20 11:03:51 too much lift
creations-chat 2023-04-20 12:47:30 is this enough for a mega downvote
creations-chat 2023-04-20 12:52:51 yipee
creations-chat 2023-04-20 12:55:52 this is the part where you tell me how badly i went wrong
creations-chat 2023-04-20 15:44:43 i want to try and fix it by angle locking more 1x4 triangle wedges into it but idk how im gonna evenly spin something that's 2x2

does the slowmode really need to be two whole minutes
creations-chat 2023-04-20 15:47:22 i'll give it a shot tomorrow (i have to move so much stuff out of the way in the motorlock tower)
creations-chat 2023-04-20 15:49:24 how would you suggest i make a very sharp and long nose for my mirage v
help 2023-04-21 10:37:54 all you can do is do a better job of hiding them inside the build
creations-chat 2023-04-21 10:42:47 i hid the motor2s inside the fuselage and connected them to the control surface using text and cameras, now the wing doesnt have a motor2 on the tip
creations-chat 2023-04-21 10:53:41 cant, if i do, then the wings will rub against each other and get jammed
creations-chat 2023-04-21 11:20:03 control surfaces are less versatile and smaller
creations-chat 2023-04-21 11:29:58 moving parts give more dopamine üëç
help 2023-04-22 09:24:14 how would I go about making these airbrakes on the mirage 5? they're somewhere around the center of each wing
help 2023-04-22 11:37:25 i think ill use the trapdoors externally and then put the control panels inside the fuselage
help 2023-04-22 11:37:30 i have a lot of space to work with
creations-chat 2023-04-22 13:28:46 <@971081152066637904> what is up with the single block sticking out of the tail wing
help 2023-04-23 06:55:45 is it a motor2 connected to another motor2
help 2023-04-23 06:55:50 if so then no
creations-chat 2023-04-24 12:19:22 <@914779689745285140> can you do it while spinning at 68 rpm
creations-chat 2023-04-24 12:22:36 put a huge cannon on the bottom of the hull

creations-chat 2023-04-24 12:29:42 please continue with the updates üôè 

also in the future you should add a functional docking bay üëç
creations-chat 2023-04-24 12:58:46 aside from the balls on the intakes needing to be replaced what should I fix on this
creations-chat 2023-04-24 13:57:37 it already is

creations-chat 2023-04-27 13:35:59 i know but it applies to plane crazy too does it not? also i was talking about roblox game devs not roblox themselves
help 2023-04-28 05:28:09 if you have too much lift in the front of your plane/too much weight in the back, then it will wobble up and down at speeds past ~300. If you have too many horizontal wings near the front it will wobble side to side, and if you have too many of either in the back then controls will stiffen up and you will start wobbling too
help 2023-04-28 05:28:31 make space for adding or subtracting wing panels inside your plane so you can tune it
help 2023-04-28 05:28:40 and make sure your controls aren't super sensitive

creations-chat 2023-04-30 13:27:14 do you understand that if something is motorlocked inside of another block, you can‚Äôt make it move using motor 2s or it will break the angle lock?
creations-chat 2023-04-30 13:31:34 let‚Äôs use my mirage 5‚Äôs canopy as an example. It‚Äôs noclipped inside the nose because of angle locking. do you think this can be made to open?
creations-chat 2023-04-30 13:33:39 have you noticed that his canopy is also slightly noclipped into the body of the plane using motorlocks? how do you suppose he would make it open without breaking everything?

creations-chat 2023-05-11 13:27:12 i would build more pvp oriented builds but the current meta is just 360 maneuverability with instant turning and the ability to stop midair then proceed to go at 13k studs per second, which leads to all pvp getting dominated by those stupid fucking balls with guns and rockets on them


(and also i can‚Äôt even play pc anymore because my launch fps dropped to 10 a week ago out of nowhere ü§©)

help 2023-05-12 00:48:27 you do it manually
creations-chat 2023-05-12 02:45:53 just motorlock some signs in

you can offset them by half a block by only using a single locked motor instead of two motors stacked on each other
creations-chat 2023-05-12 04:49:42 man i knew about the j20 but i didnt know what it looked like until now, i kinda wanna build it
creations-chat 2023-05-12 04:51:46 yeah but delta wing + canards on a stealth plane üò± (i love delta wing planes)
help 2023-05-12 04:52:47 just put rocket thrusters
creations-chat 2023-05-12 04:56:47 actually, i was planning on building a 5th gen delta wing and in my mind it looked exactly like the j20 before i even knew what the j20 looked like
help 2023-05-12 05:02:19 try putting some propellers in the back that raise the tail upwards, it would make the main rotor face a little to the front and start making you go forwards

creations-chat 2023-05-14 05:31:21 mb I‚Äôll remove my upvote <:clueless:942802644043464734>
creations-chat 2023-05-14 05:33:25 jokes aside it‚Äôs really good (also I actually forgot to upvote when I first saw it so thanks for reminding me)

I will say though, the missiles hang a little too low
creations-chat 2023-05-14 05:44:39 should i keep the cylinder canopy or switch to a wedge one that can open and close
creations-chat 2023-05-14 08:42:28 they already are half cylinders

wait which ones are you talking about
help 2023-05-14 08:58:07 if you have motorlocks, try adding extra wing panels to the front end of the plane
help 2023-05-14 08:58:27 if that makes it worse then you need to remove them and instead add more wing panels in the back
help 2023-05-14 10:50:48 if you're tilting upwards then you either need to remove weight in the back or add weight in the front
help 2023-05-14 10:51:08 or if you want to fiddle with the wings and risk making it wobble again then you can remove some wing panels
help 2023-05-14 12:02:50 you‚Äôll have to suffer through trial and errol then. Just keep adding or subtracting wings in the rear and front until you‚Äôve removed the wobble
help 2023-05-14 12:03:04 you‚Äôll get there if you go at it long enough
creations-chat 2023-05-14 12:03:49 hide the cheese grater wings and it might be salvageable
creations-chat 2023-05-14 12:09:01 you can actually motorlock wing panels/trapdoors on top of control surfaces and they‚Äôll still function fine
help 2023-05-14 12:14:53 if i can get a 1400~ block jet to go 1500 sps without wobbling then you can get your jet to not wobble too
help 2023-05-14 12:14:57 you can do it
help 2023-05-14 12:15:14 just
help 2023-05-14 12:15:17 it might take a while
help 2023-05-14 12:16:36 see if you can pull that off then surely the tiny one should be a piece of cake
help 2023-05-14 12:17:56 
help 2023-05-14 12:18:07 all the wing panels you can see there are for stabilization
help 2023-05-14 12:18:47 they don‚Äôt have to be on the actual wings of the plane you can just stuff them inside the nose or fuselage using motorlocking
creations-chat 2023-05-15 05:06:14 aside from emilos‚Äô fictional mirage has anyone made a good mirage in this server
creations-chat 2023-05-15 08:30:59 what is that long stick of cameras


wait is that a motor in the middle? don‚Äôt tell me it just floats there once you‚Äôve launched and folded everything üò¶
creations-chat 2023-05-15 09:42:51 the skeleton appears
help 2023-05-15 09:48:08 just think of each motor block in the motorlock tower as a separate layer
help 2023-05-15 09:48:21 they all collapse together into one single layer when you launch
help 2023-05-15 09:48:49 but if you for example build something connected to one of the motors that is a block higher than the motor it is connected to
help 2023-05-15 09:48:59 then that will also be a block higher than all the other layers
help 2023-05-15 10:54:39 half motorlock a triangle wedge 1x4
help 2023-05-15 10:54:58 the part that sticks out should look like a half triangle wedge 1x2

(only like this because it lets it be concealed)
creations-chat 2023-05-16 15:37:16 mirage 5 

also here's what it looks like when folded (also the reason why i made it like this in the first place)

sacrificed good looking gears for a clean underside when folded üí™
creations-chat 2023-05-16 15:39:21 i will only post it to <#384025409945337856> once i've designed droptanks and matra r.550s for it

^I'm not being serious lol chill out
creations-chat 2023-05-16 15:55:31 oh damn you're the guy with the incomplete engine and tail fins that take up half of the plot, thought you looked familiar lol
creations-chat 2023-05-16 16:02:04 your mig 29 looks spicy i dont know if i can come out on top

also you can apply for expert role because of the upvotes on that thing, just saying
creations-chat 2023-05-16 16:08:24 also here's an older backup save i have of my mirage that had functioning landing gear (looked really clunky imo which is why im trying to hide it now but it had suspension and stuff) it was also really buggy sometimes and the suspension tended to noclip through the wings

honestly it only served to give me somewhat smoother landings than normal

(((also it stuck out a whole block under the plane which didnt look good)))
creations-chat 2023-05-16 16:10:27 i think im gonna go ahead and overwrite that save slot now
creations-chat 2023-05-16 16:13:04 this?
creations-chat 2023-05-16 16:15:15 ohhhhh right yeah i've been meaning to do that for a while lol, i'll go do it now
creations-chat 2023-05-16 16:24:11 should i spend the time to motorlock a ton of wedges into it so it's more rounded
creations-chat 2023-05-16 16:26:22 delta wings too small for the job on this one i think i'll stick with wedges (also ew flight performance killer)

old version 

I SAID OLD VERSION RAHHH
creations-chat 2023-05-16 16:31:00 ok it's less of them being too small and more of i dont want to kill my flight performance

also here's the sideview <@912065912658608190>
creations-chat 2023-05-16 16:34:39 i already spent the effort to hide the motors that move them how in the world am i gonna hide the gaps
creations-chat 2023-05-16 16:36:50 problem is they are connected to the same angle lock as the entire wing so they have to move with it (though i guess i could try to add more motorlock towers directly on the wing maybe)
creations-chat 2023-05-16 16:38:52 also this is the space that i have to work with pre-launch lol

anyway see you in 10 minutes ill try to move it in with motorlocks
creations-chat 2023-05-16 16:51:30 <@912065912658608190> <@467459282250629120> alright that was way easier than i thought it would be now i just have to mirror it and hide the last gap
creations-chat 2023-05-16 16:56:31 oh my goodness gracious why didnt i do this earlier
creations-chat 2023-05-16 16:58:46 actually made such a huge difference lol what was i doing this whole time
creations-chat 2023-05-16 17:00:54 yes it does! i actually thought friction might mess it up but turns out nope

creations-chat 2023-05-16 17:42:11 surely if the f-62 whatever guy can have no motorlocks on his f-14 wings then you can too

also wow since when did he leave
creations-chat 2023-05-16 17:44:21 <@912065912658608190> alright they're (the flaps) a bit stiff now
creations-chat 2023-05-16 18:01:55 because there is now no gap between the wings and the flaps, they‚Äôll sometimes stiffen up before moving properly
creations-chat 2023-05-16 18:04:25 what do you mean inside or outside, also i tried the ice and it made my motor 2s freak out for some reason so i reverted it
creations-chat 2023-05-16 18:06:51 both the ailerons and flaperons (if that‚Äôs what they‚Äôre called on delta wings) and the rudder started twitching like crazy when i made them ice
creations-chat 2023-05-16 18:48:30 honestly i think you should go without the camo it makes it look like someone built it in minecraft
creations-chat 2023-05-16 18:53:43 yes

creations-chat 2023-05-17 11:59:43 managed to stuff the wheels inside the fuselage yipee
creations-chat 2023-05-17 12:01:58 it's for adding a separate color under the wings without killing my flight performance
creations-chat 2023-05-17 12:07:32 yeah... what else would they be, disconnectors? anyway here's what both sides look like
creations-chat 2023-05-17 12:09:38 amazing, now give me helpful criticism so i can do better and we can have a productive conversation
creations-chat 2023-05-17 12:12:05 ok aside from the poopoo fart rocket thruster exhaust which i am fully aware of what exactly should i do here

help 2023-05-18 12:52:12 and then you move the motor 1
help 2023-05-18 12:52:19 then you collapse the motorlock tower

creations-chat 2023-05-19 02:57:13 anyway if it‚Äôs a 2 block wide plane you should try angle locking a bunch of 1x4 triangle wedges together for the sharp tip


‚Äúno spamming‚Äù it was just a gif stupid bot
creations-chat 2023-05-19 03:16:14 you can‚Äôt do it with motor 2
creations-chat 2023-05-19 03:18:42 what else do you think? these are the only motor 2s in the picture. you need to use regular motors with the lock function
creations-chat 2023-05-19 03:21:16 you align it manually with blocks, then disconnect the blocks after you align them. Use tnt to delay the collapse of the motorlock tower

DAILY 2 PIXELS OF TOMCAT PROGRESS
creations-chat 2023-05-24 07:09:37 how do you have 4 expert roles
creations-chat 2023-05-24 07:12:33 ok so you get a motorlock tower and put tnt on it first so you can choose when to lock the tower, get a powered motor with the lock function, place it on the motorlock tower, connect the blocks you want to angle lock to the powered motorlock, and then when you launch you move the powered motorlock before collapsing the motorlock tower

the blocks that were moved by the powered motorlock will stay at the position you angled them in even when you collapse the tower (if you do it correctly)
creations-chat 2023-05-24 07:16:12 do not hold the button you use for angling the blocks while you collapse the motorlock tower or it will break your build üëç

also, don‚Äôt use motor2 for angling blocks because it does not have a lock setting
creations-chat 2023-05-24 07:26:32 photos courtesy of my iphone 7

blue motor is for angle locking, keep the ‚Äúpowered‚Äù setting and ‚Äúlock‚Äù settings on

green blocks are the ones being angle locked
creations-chat 2023-05-24 07:28:59 when you launch, move the motor and the blocks connected to it to your desired position and then collapse the motorlock tower using tnt/springs/disconnectors. if you do it correctly then the angled blocks should merge with the other blocks in the build and stay like in the third image

obviously this can also be used in situations where you don‚Äôt need the angled blocks to merge with other blocks
creations-chat 2023-05-24 09:36:28 the mig 21 is a delta wing, more specifically a tailed delta wing
creations-chat 2023-05-24 09:47:49 which mig21 variant are you trying to build anyway

creations-chat 2023-05-24 11:02:16 motorlocking:
creations-chat 2023-05-24 11:05:34 well it‚Äôs the way you‚Äôre asking for
creations-chat 2023-05-24 11:12:39 it‚Äôs only like that for you because you aren‚Äôt used to it

not even months, you‚Äôll get used to it in just a few days if you work with it
creations-chat 2023-05-24 11:14:59 that‚Äôs the spirit
creations-chat 2023-05-24 11:43:46 if the wheels function and actually make the tank move then I can understand that but if they‚Äôre also non-functional then he might as well have just added fake tracks as well

(accidentally uses ‚Äúas well‚Äù twice in the same sentence)
help 2023-05-24 11:45:15 compact reloadable cannons are way too complicated and extremely unreliable
help 2023-05-24 11:45:24 + they are highly impractical
help 2023-05-24 11:46:09 tnt cannons in general as well as block-built missiles are mostly useless past certain speeds because of explosion delay
help 2023-05-24 11:46:26 (as in the explosion radius of the tnt lags behind the actual tnt block)
help 2023-05-24 11:47:52 your best option for a cannon type explosive is to wait 6 months for the winter event so you can get firework launchers
help 2023-05-24 11:48:04 (or just buy it, up to you)
help 2023-05-24 11:48:34 if you really want a tnt cannon your best option is to make a non-reloadable one
help 2023-05-24 11:49:12 also, magnets are the most reliable for propelling the tnt balls
help 2023-05-24 11:49:19 just make the barrel out of ice
help 2023-05-24 11:49:32 (use the paint tool and go to materials)
help 2023-05-24 11:49:45 ah
help 2023-05-24 11:49:59 that would be because you made the magnets too strong
help 2023-05-24 11:50:23 try putting one magnet at the start of the cannon to push the tnt out and then add magnets on the muzzle
help 2023-05-24 11:50:40 the magnets at the muzzle will be the ones doing the launching
creations-chat 2023-05-24 11:52:03 can‚Äôt the sliding be solved using a bunch of maximum drag hover thrusters
help 2023-05-24 11:52:15 it depends
help 2023-05-24 11:52:28 i can‚Äôt go into the game to test right now so you might want to check youtube
help 2023-05-24 11:53:50 yes, mostly because if you make the cannon too big then it will be too heavy for the motors to move it without bugging out
help 2023-05-24 11:54:01 as for accuracy I‚Äôm not sure

creations-chat 2023-05-24 11:57:48 <@604636023141433365> honestly just paint it and move the fake wheels closer together (maybe make them smaller and then move them closer)

never using hover thrusters again ong
creations-chat 2023-05-24 20:42:46 i can just use conveyors for that anyway
creations-chat 2023-05-24 20:45:38 it's just one conveyor on a motor2 ill be fine 

(THE SOUND OF THE ROCKETS IS KILLING ME)

what is it (sorry i cant tell)
creations-chat 2023-05-24 20:53:55 either rotated wedge 1x2s, regular jet engine, or if you want more angle locking pain then the funny angled wing/control panel
creations-chat 2023-05-24 20:59:42 personally i prefer control panels so you can have the nozzle contract when you use afterburner
creations-chat 2023-05-24 21:01:49 still applies, just make it 2x2 üëç (angle locking it will be a pain)
creations-chat 2023-05-24 21:03:57 small on purpose because the moving part on the real thing doesnt stick out that much üëç
creations-chat 2023-05-24 21:09:29 yeah i was just giving an example, probably should have said
help 2023-05-24 21:11:12 if you angle lock enough blocks together then you can make it but then you‚Äôll have a bunch of super dense and heavy wheels
help 2023-05-24 21:11:38 it will take you a lot of blocks
help 2023-05-24 21:12:04 it‚Äôs like those custom nosecones you‚Äôll see sometimes on builds

creations-chat 2023-06-06 18:50:17 that's what ive been saying to myself aaauugggghhh how do i choose

problem with the cylinder is that i cant replicate it on the rest of the plane's curves because there's no space to build it
creations-chat 2023-06-06 18:54:28 can't do that because of this, also <@814978152672657458> if i were to try and smooth out the tip i would have to angle lock 500 trail blocks into a cone

creations-chat 2023-06-06 18:59:30 because most of us act dumb, either because of being a kid or because of not reading the <#925522972586967092> channel before asking a question

or because of getting really mad after receiving criticism (though sometimes the "criticism" is just bullying in which case it's kinda understandable to get mad)
creations-chat 2023-06-06 19:02:01 pcc mindset means that instead of correcting someone or helping them you yell at them and send the whitename activity gif (cue eskeline coming in to reply to me and send the whitename activity gif)

help 2023-06-06 20:55:26 or or
help 2023-06-06 20:55:32 because i think what‚Äôs happening is that
help 2023-06-06 20:55:44 when the motorlock tower collapses
help 2023-06-06 20:56:00 the motor 2s for your vertical stabilizer twitch upwards a bit
help 2023-06-06 20:56:09 which causes the wing panels to clip into the motor
help 2023-06-06 20:56:37 you can prevent this by welding the stabilizer to another block to prevent it from twitching using tnt/springs
help 2023-06-06 20:56:53 then disconnect/explode the tnt/springs to unweld the stabilizer
help 2023-06-06 20:58:53 (wouldn‚Äôt be a problem if rickje would get around to fixing motor 2s from being incredible weak but oh well)
help 2023-06-06 20:59:48 just do what i mentioned
help 2023-06-06 21:00:11 stick the vertical stabilizer to another stationary block using tnt or springs and then disconnect them after the motorlock tower collapses
help 2023-06-06 21:00:15 see if it works
help 2023-06-06 21:00:29 cause i can see in the image that it‚Äôs forcefully tilted upwards by a bit

help 2023-06-06 21:16:22 if you want
help 2023-06-06 21:16:31 you could reconstruct it using angle locked disconnectors
help 2023-06-06 21:16:50 which would move it to the right slightly and give space for the vertical stabilizer

help 2023-06-06 21:37:21 nice

creations-chat 2023-06-12 04:20:13 you need to make the pilot seat and rest of the build motorlock towards the camera lock and not the camera lock going towards the seat
creations-chat 2023-06-12 14:33:27 he said it in reference to a post that ahh made of an actual wip which he then proceeded to delete after being called out (hence the ‚Äúnot so fast nerd‚Äù)

creations-chat 2023-06-13 08:19:43 doesnt the f-14 do that when the wings are swept back
creations-chat 2023-06-13 09:07:19 they do have those flap things that i don‚Äôt know the name of that are embedded in the wings though right?
creations-chat 2023-06-13 09:43:55 just finished my new space shuttle guys what do you think
creations-chat 2023-06-16 13:04:39 it‚Äôs as simple as this

blue motor is a powered motorlock, green blocks are the blocks you want to angle
creations-chat 2023-06-16 13:06:42 no, motor2 cannot be used for angle locking because it has no lock setting. you need to use a regular motor with both lock and powered settings on, then move it to the position you want to angle the blocks in.
creations-chat 2023-06-16 13:08:51 people get around this by having temporary blocks to stop the angled blocks from moving past the angle they want

it‚Äôs not rocket science it‚Äôs literally just moving blocks with a motor before you collapse the motorlock tower
creations-chat 2023-06-16 13:11:54 it‚Äôs extremely useful but if you‚Äôre like me and really need to get every angle on a build to be just right then it‚Äôs gonna end up looking like this pre launch
creations-chat 2023-06-16 15:37:06 will it have a glass canopy or you‚Äôre just gonna paint it black to cover the motorlocks
creations-chat 2023-06-16 15:40:00 can you maybe try to replace the half wedges on the nose with motorlocked half cylinders
creations-chat 2023-06-16 15:42:07 like this (outdated picture (didnt even keep it))
creations-chat 2023-06-16 17:35:33 turn on both lock and powered on the motors so they don‚Äôt split after you fold it, and turn on physics on any anchor blocks in the build
bug-reports 2023-06-18 15:22:40 the lock setting on motors in question:
creations-chat 2023-06-19 02:53:55 put two trapdoors/disconnectors side by side
creations-chat 2023-06-19 04:19:07 then just use half blocks <:shock:1098116005252841503> it‚Äôll take like two motors at most
creations-chat 2023-06-19 04:22:27 you center it with one motor and then angle lock it with the second motor

or use pistons idfk
help 2023-06-19 05:38:07 check your ping
help 2023-06-19 05:38:50 sometimes the game has a seizure if you
a) move too many motors with blocks on them at the same time
b) explode a lot of tnt (like in motorlock towers)
help 2023-06-19 05:39:22 if that happens then your best option is to go to a private server
help 2023-06-19 05:39:29 or keep reloading the build
help 2023-06-19 05:40:47 yes that would be an issue
help 2023-06-19 05:41:09 i would try binding some of them to a second key if they‚Äôre piston locks so that you‚Äôre not moving everything at the same time
help 2023-06-19 06:37:43 honestly too short but i guess you‚Äôre not building it to scale so it‚Äôs fine
creations-chat 2023-06-19 06:41:09 did you mean to say far off then

if you say far from off then that would mean very close
help 2023-06-19 08:55:07 how is he gonna do that it‚Äôs a 1 wide
