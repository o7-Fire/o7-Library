bug-reports 2019-05-24 21:27:15 When you spawn controls are getting reversed
bug-reports 2019-06-07 22:12:40 When I try to spawn in the water I don't, Instead I spawn in front of the base.
bug-reports 2019-06-08 13:42:15 <@!318892614378061824>  Yeah I did look at the settings
bug-reports 2019-06-08 17:53:33 Spawned in and controls are reversed and cannot move
bug-reports 2019-06-11 23:30:04 My save file got corrupted
bug-reports 2019-06-13 13:57:12 <@456226577798135808>  Quick tip, for rockets to work you need to add helium inside
bug-reports 2019-06-24 19:19:53 I spawn in my creation and it can't move, jumping out and back in the seat allows me to start the engine sounds but it still doesn't move. This happens with all my creations.
bug-reports 2019-06-26 18:30:27 <@!263959626804887552>  Same here with the engines
