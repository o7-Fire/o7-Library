help 2020-05-07 23:42:44 i just recently made a field of air mines
help 2020-05-07 23:42:55 just anchored blocks with explosive blocks on top
help 2020-05-07 23:43:37 these are the settings, I *AM* on a pvp server, and when another person runs into them(has been tested several times), the bombs don't blow up
help 2020-05-07 23:43:53 only 1 time has it happened, and i haven't changed a setting, and only a single mine exploded
help 2020-05-07 23:45:14 i dont use it
help 2020-05-07 23:45:37 so i set them to keypad multiply because i wouldn't accidentally press it and set them off which is what i dont want them to do
help 2020-05-07 23:45:49 i want any approaching bombers to just get hit and blow up
help 2020-05-07 23:47:29 and they're crashing fairly hard

help 2020-05-09 18:08:29 can somebody with a hovercraft or helicopter that can hover help me test my net
help 2020-05-13 00:01:16 anyone know the best way to mobilize my net(like, hovercraft? Drone? Heli? etc.)? Or perhaps a better way to make the net than anchored blocks and rope
help 2020-05-13 00:02:15 ive tried normal blocks and although they work well, it functions the same as unanchored anchor blocks, and i'd rather use the anchor blocks because having that many blocks attached by rope is p laggy when it moves, so i'd like to be able to lock it.
help 2020-05-13 00:08:42 so like springs
help 2020-05-13 00:08:49 they dont bend, der
help 2020-05-13 00:10:00 ok
help 2020-05-13 00:20:57 im probably gonna put 8 or so rope cords to the edges, put disconnectors there
help 2020-05-13 00:21:20 1 on each corner, 1 a few in in the same corner direction
