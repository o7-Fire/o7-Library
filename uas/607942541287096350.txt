creations-chat 2020-06-01 04:22:54 <@!404632014189494293> maybe round out the jet engines under the wing other then that itâ€™s good
bug-reports 2020-06-01 05:04:58 If you ever experience the thing where you canâ€™t place a block and itâ€™s like thereâ€™s an invisible block where there is none just move the creation in any direction and back to fix it

bug-reports 2020-10-25 04:17:29 Ok so i have a nice plane with about 1000 blocks (which i don't know is relevant cause bigger creations don't do this) After about 3-5 minutes of it being spawned my screen freezes and replays the same sound over and over for about 14 minutes when a error message pops up saying to close roblox. usually in that time it autosaves so i haven't yet lost any progress but i cant really fly it or test it at all. I don't think its a performance thing but here are my specs just incase:   

Ryzen 3
Rtx 2060
16 GB ram

If anyone can help that would be greatly appreciated : )
bug-reports 2020-10-25 05:14:06 this hasnt happened with any other more intensive games and its only with one medium size plane
bug-reports 2020-10-25 05:30:21 well yes but this isnt lag my entire game crashes
bug-reports 2020-10-25 05:34:30 even if im not moving
bug-reports 2020-10-25 05:34:45 sometimes it freezes the game after its been spawned in for like 10 seconds
bug-reports 2020-10-25 05:34:50 only this one creation
bug-reports 2020-10-25 05:57:09 so your saying playing 32 youtube live streams in firefox version 1.0 whilst spinning my pc over a bonfire at the same time as playing a recourse demanding game doesn't fare well?
