bug-reports 2022-05-27 16:08:11 if i place trapdoors under a hover thruster
bug-reports 2022-05-27 16:08:18 then the build motorlocks wrong
bug-reports 2022-05-27 16:08:26 only happens on that hover thruster
bug-reports 2022-05-27 16:08:37 idk if i can replicate it now
bug-reports 2022-05-27 16:08:43 maybe just bad motor locking
bug-reports 2022-05-27 16:09:04 if i remove it
bug-reports 2022-05-27 16:09:11 the build motor locks right
bug-reports 2022-05-27 16:09:26 and by that i mean a single motor
bug-reports 2022-05-27 16:09:37 both arent close to each other
bug-reports 2022-05-28 07:17:20 why does a certain motor not motorlock if i put a trapdoor near a certain hover thruster
bug-reports 2022-05-28 07:17:36 its annoying
bug-reports 2022-05-28 07:17:41 how 2 fix
