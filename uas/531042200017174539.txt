creations-chat 2020-08-12 09:47:14 That would’ve worked also without the motor lock

creations-chat 2020-08-22 19:13:14 What is the most simple single bladed rotor there is?
creations-chat 2020-08-22 19:13:20 
creations-chat 2020-08-22 19:13:43 I need it lol
creations-chat 2020-08-22 19:14:00 F
creations-chat 2020-08-22 19:14:24 Well since people are inventing new stuff and i hoped that it would be invented
creations-chat 2020-08-22 19:15:00 > i can try and find out how to make a single rotor if you want
<@!637820395961188355>  you can, but i do need like really small and idk if you’d want to make one without knowing it’ll fit
creations-chat 2020-08-22 19:16:14 Probably 3x3 and like 6 high
creations-chat 2020-08-22 19:16:30 Idk if that’s possible
creations-chat 2020-08-22 19:16:53 Alright, thank you so much, if i use it if it fits etc i’ll credit you
creations-chat 2020-08-22 19:24:55 Whatever works i guess, it’s not hard to be a better engineer in plane crazy than me
creations-chat 2020-08-22 19:25:04 I can barely use locked motors lol
creations-chat 2020-08-22 19:33:35 Hmmm
creations-chat 2020-08-22 19:33:44 And it doesn’t spin out yet?
creations-chat 2020-08-22 19:40:48 Maybe you stablelize it with the tailrotor, idk how that works
creations-chat 2020-08-22 19:40:54 Ah it lifts, that’s a good thing
creations-chat 2020-08-22 19:42:54 Hmm
creations-chat 2020-08-22 19:42:57 That could work
creations-chat 2020-08-22 19:43:36 What if the rear rotor is coaxial?
creations-chat 2020-08-22 19:43:41 Would that work?
creations-chat 2020-08-22 19:43:47 Or is that what you did?
creations-chat 2020-08-22 19:44:04 Maybe the tailrotor needs propellor blades or something
creations-chat 2020-08-22 19:46:27 Hmm
creations-chat 2020-08-22 19:50:15 <@!637820395961188355> i use propellor engines at the tail to steer by the way, so the swashplate doesn’t need to move forward or backwards etc
creations-chat 2020-08-22 19:50:20 Idk if you did that
creations-chat 2020-08-22 19:58:17 It’s okay
creations-chat 2020-08-22 19:58:29 You do? Do you have a pic?

creations-chat 2020-08-23 17:57:55 Because of torque

creations-chat 2020-08-23 18:03:55 Unless he goes ham on the downvote
creations-chat 2020-08-23 18:04:43 And you haven’t read the chat fully about my opinion about it
creations-chat 2020-08-23 18:06:27 Maybe it has none
creations-chat 2020-08-23 18:07:39 I guess people like the uncolored version of the apache more

creations-chat 2020-09-30 04:47:06 Swashplates aren’t that good imo. They glitch out alot
creations-chat 2020-11-12 12:59:03 Why does this work (A train from a year ago that still works)
creations-chat 2020-11-12 13:00:59 But not this
creations-chat 2020-11-12 13:04:20 Thanks, it just makes my brain die cuz the same chassis works on only one train
creations-chat 2020-11-12 13:06:53 <@456226577798135808> Probablt but i can't find the cause

creations-chat 2021-06-24 20:11:37 The tail? So what do i need to change? <@!499705220637392897>
creations-chat 2021-06-24 20:13:39 I thought you meant something else with tail, it isn’t possible tho due to the fact it needs a angle and i don’t have the room for that
creations-chat 2021-06-24 20:15:42 Not your build, sometimes you have to sacrifice shit, idrc. I’m not that much of a realism nerd lol. But thanks for pointing it out tho
