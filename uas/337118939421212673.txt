creations-chat 2020-03-05 22:30:23 also for the 2 people that gave me the downdoot

bug-reports 2020-03-05 22:40:27 ye that usually happens when you place blocks too quickly or when you place them when the game lags
bug-reports 2020-03-05 23:58:46 tfw you don't anchor your turrets
help 2020-03-06 00:00:59 well, as far as I've noticed, makes movement more sluggish

help 2020-03-06 00:10:20 Speaking of ranks
If I use a magnet engine in my build, would it still be able to qualify?
(It's not mentioned in the reqs.)
creations-chat 2020-03-06 10:36:55 did I just see some build the fecken' Gustav?

creations-chat 2020-04-01 21:04:13 can someone kindly delete the repost of the second pic?
creations-chat 2020-04-01 21:05:35 this thing took ~1.5 hours to build, 2268 blocks + can float ominously mid-air without anchor
creations-chat 2020-04-01 21:05:58 now ima go to sleep, updoot or downdoot as you please
creations-chat 2020-08-03 18:11:27 I'd say keep only the edge of the sword light gray
make the blunt part of the blade a slightly darker shade
creations-chat 2020-08-03 18:12:24 btw, do y'all like the gradients I used on my thing?
Took me forever to paint
creations-chat 2020-08-03 18:13:34 ngl, that tank turret seems pretty impressive
tho what do you use to launch the explosive balls themselves?
creations-chat 2020-08-03 18:13:49 thanks :D
creations-chat 2020-08-03 18:14:00 ah, makes sense
creations-chat 2020-08-03 18:14:51 weird
creations-chat 2020-08-03 18:15:01 I suggest asking a server mod about it
creations-chat 2020-08-03 18:15:34 on what?
creations-chat 2020-08-03 18:17:47 It looks pretty accurate
especially considering that Plane Crazy doesn't have any complex wedges to play with
