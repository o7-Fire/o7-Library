creations-chat 2021-07-07 18:13:16 ok
creations-chat 2023-04-29 23:06:23 F-18 super hornet
creations-chat 2023-04-29 23:35:25 is it bad ?
creations-chat 2023-04-29 23:41:44 As a babft player i cannot afford to sacrifice a smooth nose with one with gaps
creations-chat 2023-04-29 23:57:29 Its a concept f18 its sharp on purpose
creations-chat 2023-04-29 23:59:52 Fill ill maybe change the nose
creations-chat 2023-04-30 00:03:20 Fine i change nose
creations-chat 2023-04-30 00:23:34 Ngl thats how sharp the nose is
creations-chat 2023-04-30 00:25:46 well its the most accurate to it
creations-chat 2023-04-30 00:28:07 ?????? 90% of people say its sharp
creations-chat 2023-04-30 00:30:45 ok what if i do a 45 degree tip?
creations-chat 2023-04-30 00:33:41 Look the f18 tip is naturally sharp,there is no way i can put the general nose of planes that people use
creations-chat 2023-04-30 00:36:50 The tip is innacurate
creations-chat 2023-04-30 00:38:52 But its innacurate.
creations-chat 2023-04-30 00:41:43 thats not the f18 super hornet ðŸ’€
creations-chat 2023-04-30 00:44:20 Bruh
creations-chat 2023-04-30 00:46:23 u 2 came out with bare context. That is barely what i am talking about. First of all thats not even what they are complaining about. Second of all i am talking about the side perspective.
creations-chat 2023-04-30 00:48:39 Idk but nose is sharp
creations-chat 2023-04-30 00:50:42 bruh what, a 2 block wide plane
creations-chat 2023-04-30 00:52:52 making it 2 blocks wide will make it look sharper ðŸ’€

creations-chat 2023-04-30 02:30:49 Ngl i wanna make a yatch now
creations-chat 2023-04-30 03:35:55 what i do :(( i changed the nose please dont threaten me
creations-chat 2023-04-30 03:38:46 whats wrong with it ðŸ˜¢ðŸ˜¢ðŸ˜¢
creations-chat 2023-04-30 03:47:43 look ok. The truth is that im a build a boat for treasure builder ok?  I am not used to the gaps you see on builds. Thats why i stick to smooth accuracy than using exessive motor locking as it cannot always be perfect and can cause gaps. This is the shit i make in babft. Am learning
creations-chat 2023-04-30 03:50:17 ok ill do my best. Btw the car took 20 days and 140 hours ðŸ’€
creations-chat 2023-04-30 03:55:56 Ngl that looks pro
creations-chat 2023-05-06 15:18:51 f14 (nose is changed but not in this pic)
bug-reports 2023-05-06 15:20:07 who dummy?
creations-chat 2023-05-06 15:22:52 good atleast its noticable (i wrote f14 on purpose)
creations-chat 2023-05-06 15:48:34 Why is it?
creations-chat 2023-05-06 15:53:23 bro i said the nose has been changed but its not published yet. Also whats wrong with a 3 block body or nose. its a bigger scale plane. Nothing changes. Ngl what you said was extremely rude
creations-chat 2023-05-06 15:56:12 no it can be 3 blocks with a bigger scale plane
creations-chat 2023-05-06 15:58:29 Atleast he doesnt trash talk on peoples builds
creations-chat 2023-05-06 16:02:54 Im sorry but thats a different plane im making the f18 super hornet 2 seater,also dont show me someones build like that. I made mine differently with a much bigger scale than this,thats why the nose is 3 blocks wide. The scale does not affect the proportions of the plane at all.
creations-chat 2023-05-06 16:05:53 so its completely shit because of the spine? are you serious? So if i take sticknubs build,find the thing that looks worse,then it becomes shit? Where is your logic?
creations-chat 2023-05-06 16:10:59 the width of the nose is not a probleme but the sharpness is which i fixed but the spin can fix
creations-chat 2023-05-06 16:16:44 2 block wide nose you do you
creations-chat 2023-05-06 16:18:50 that nose gap is the major flaw of having a 2 block wide nose
creations-chat 2023-05-06 16:20:52 did you even read in the brackets (i put that to prevent people from judging the nose)
creations-chat 2023-05-06 16:23:44 
creations-chat 2023-05-06 16:26:45 so its not a piece of shit?
creations-chat 2023-05-06 17:37:11 whats that
creations-chat 2023-05-06 17:46:28 pro tomcat
creations-chat 2023-05-06 19:15:21 very good sign that you noticed that its not a f14,thats a win for me
