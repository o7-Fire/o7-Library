plane-crazy 2020-07-31 02:25:48 Chilling
plane-crazy 2020-07-31 02:25:42 Sup
plane-crazy 2020-07-09 01:57:07 Which was impossible
plane-crazy 2020-07-09 01:57:02 But I want to replicate it's rotating afterburner or thruster
plane-crazy 2020-07-09 01:56:41 My F35 is gigantic ish
plane-crazy 2020-07-09 01:56:30 And yeah
plane-crazy 2020-07-09 01:56:27 Ghast
plane-crazy 2020-07-09 01:56:25 Oh snap
plane-crazy 2020-07-09 01:55:00 And so much engines just to produce balanced lift
plane-crazy 2020-07-09 01:54:46 I had to use so much ballast blocks
plane-crazy 2020-07-09 01:54:40 An obvious one is the F35
plane-crazy 2020-07-09 01:54:31 Yeah, it's a different story with stealth jets and fighter jets
plane-crazy 2020-07-09 01:38:26 For easy lift, just add a little more mass past the lift
plane-crazy 2020-07-09 01:38:12 It's actually easy to balance a plane
plane-crazy 2020-07-09 01:38:02 Ik
plane-crazy 2020-07-09 01:37:54 Both
plane-crazy 2020-07-09 01:33:19 It would be
plane-crazy 2020-07-05 10:16:38 That'll take a while
plane-crazy 2020-07-05 10:16:05 Sad
plane-crazy 2020-06-22 17:37:44 But the lag
plane-crazy 2020-06-22 17:37:41 Looks nice though
plane-crazy 2020-06-22 17:37:35 OOF
plane-crazy 2020-06-22 17:28:27 Does the water jet just damage players or the builds too?
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 14:37:40 Poor players
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 14:37:37 Lol
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 14:37:08 Making a high speed helicopter is nearly impossible without risking your computer and life time
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 14:36:34 Nothing you can do, unless you can make a high speed helicopter
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 14:36:04 Hmm
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 14:35:58 Use jets with good steering
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 14:35:48 Never fight them with helicopters
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 14:35:39 Speed is a good way to outrun them
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 14:35:29 Jk
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 14:35:28 Turn off PVP lol
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 14:35:20 It's easy
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 14:32:51 Is that the Loch Ness monster or it's brother?
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 14:32:31 Monstrosity?
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 14:32:21 Lol
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 14:32:06 Yet fascinated
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 14:32:02 I'm confused
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 14:28:56 Sure
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 14:28:33 Just a wing?
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 14:28:26 Exposing your weapons can just make others target your weakness, weapons
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 14:28:02 Exactly
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 14:27:48 Idk how to make a stabilizer
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 14:27:39 The missiles are fine
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 14:27:35 My F22 looks weird with the guns on it
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 14:27:24 Especially wedges and half wedges
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 14:27:07 Would be nice to have blocks with guns inside
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 14:26:44 Too much thrust and force
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 14:26:35 Lol
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 14:25:04 Lol
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 14:24:42 Mind giving me an egg to grow my own carrier?
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 14:24:31 Wait, if your carrier will be amphibious, can it lay eggs?
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 14:23:48 A lot of Roblox games aren't optimized really well
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 14:23:32 Yes, I consider Roblox a heavy game
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 14:23:20 And this laptop is simply unreliable for heavy games
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 14:23:05 My jet is simply too heavy
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 14:22:56 I even tested with or without drag
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 14:22:47 Not fast enough
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 14:22:44 I tried
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 14:22:26 glitches*
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 14:22:17 If it glithes
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 14:22:05 Would be a mess
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 14:22:02 Sure
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 14:21:57 Lol a lot of motors could be very glitchy at high speeds
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 14:21:34 And it makes my jet sway
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 14:21:13 And it accelerates unrealistically
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 14:21:02 Conveyer engines make me lag
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 14:20:38 Nice
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 14:20:05 But won't fly
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 14:20:01 I built the F35B earlier
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 14:19:48 I filled the inside with so much thrusters and jet engines, it lags, if I add more engines, there's no point of using it for PVP...
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 14:18:55 It sure isn't fast enough
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 14:18:47 Idk how to convert that to sps but
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 14:18:39 In real life it's 1200 mph?
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 14:18:21 And it flies at only 315 sps
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 14:18:06 I made the F22 Raptor in game
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 14:17:52 That's a lot faster
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 14:17:46 Jk
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 14:17:38 600 MILESSS
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 14:17:30 It's sad that real life planes are fast with only one thruster, while plane crazy requires you a lot more to fly a replica of that plane based on the size of the blocks...
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 14:16:28 Studs per second?
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 14:16:17 SPS?
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 14:16:12 OOF
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 14:13:52 You must really feel like Thanos
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 14:13:41 POWERR
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 14:13:35 OH
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 14:10:56 Lol
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 14:10:55 That's a lot
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 14:10:50 Oof
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 14:10:44 Would be nice if I could tune the turning speed of the wheels, when I turn with the wheels, it makes the suspensions jump, which makes my car lose control
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 14:09:45 Literally, all my builds were black
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 14:09:21 Wow, I've been bothered  by the trail paint bug for quite a while, I gave up on coloring my planes lol
plane-crazy 2020-06-16 08:15:55 Teach me your ways
plane-crazy 2020-06-16 08:15:52 Impressive
plane-crazy 2020-06-16 08:15:44 Wha?
plane-crazy 2020-06-16 07:44:33 OOF
plane-crazy 2020-06-16 07:16:32 The suggestions
plane-crazy 2020-06-16 07:15:56 Or not..
plane-crazy 2020-06-16 07:15:51 Maybe if I said them, you guys could make them for me?
plane-crazy 2020-06-16 07:15:33 I want to rank up higher, I have some suggestions that could be useful
plane-crazy 2020-06-16 07:14:21 hmm
plane-crazy 2020-06-16 07:14:10 hkm
plane-crazy 2020-06-16 07:13:36 Might need more force
plane-crazy 2020-06-16 07:13:25 Try increasing the torque
plane-crazy 2020-06-16 07:11:14 I'll be getting the bucket
plane-crazy 2020-06-16 07:07:07 Goodluck
plane-crazy 2020-06-16 07:06:57 That should help
plane-crazy 2020-06-16 07:06:52 There
plane-crazy 2020-06-16 07:06:50 Put helium on the tip, ballast blocks on the botton
plane-crazy 2020-06-16 07:02:08 I can't even smile voluntarily
plane-crazy 2020-06-16 07:01:43 Oof
plane-crazy 2020-06-16 07:01:20 Well, wings act like a wall too, to avoid too much steer or roll with the rocket
plane-crazy 2020-06-16 07:01:01 Stick to delta wings
plane-crazy 2020-06-16 07:00:40 But not long ones ofc
plane-crazy 2020-06-16 07:00:34 A rocket has wings too
plane-crazy 2020-06-16 07:00:24 I'm in
plane-crazy 2020-06-16 07:00:15 Oof
plane-crazy 2020-06-16 06:59:37 And of course, more wings to stabilize it
plane-crazy 2020-06-16 06:59:22 MOREEE POWWWERR
plane-crazy 2020-06-16 06:57:35 Yesn't
plane-crazy 2020-06-16 02:47:51 Alright, there's my second mission, wish my luck
plane-crazy 2020-06-16 02:45:23 Is it possible to get multiple ranks?
plane-crazy 2020-06-16 01:33:38 Yeah, because of that, I have to spend hours testing and adjusting
