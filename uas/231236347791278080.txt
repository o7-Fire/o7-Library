creations-chat 2018-11-11 03:38:47 This was supposed to be a learjet but i was having trouble with the weight so i decided to just smash a lot of engines on it

creations-chat 2018-11-11 03:39:24 because it looks so bad

creations-chat 2018-11-12 03:29:43 ok ive done my barrel roll
creations-chat 2018-11-12 05:51:08 i cant manage to see how you can put all your time into these stuff and not get stressed or bored
creations-chat 2018-11-12 06:38:55 well im trying to make a pixel art about my waifu
creations-chat 2018-11-12 06:38:58 and well
creations-chat 2018-11-12 06:39:06 *lets just say that im kinda getting annoyed over it*
creations-chat 2018-11-12 06:39:42 because idk what to build
creations-chat 2018-11-12 06:40:28 ye only because i couldnt find out what i wanted to build
creations-chat 2018-11-12 06:40:34 because i dont want one thats too hard
creations-chat 2018-11-12 06:41:56 i tried building one of my favorite battleships
creations-chat 2018-11-12 06:41:59 the nelson class
creations-chat 2018-11-12 06:42:08 but after i built the hull i then realized how i am going to build the guns
creations-chat 2018-11-12 06:42:14 since its so complex and weird
creations-chat 2018-11-12 06:43:09 because its 3 barrels on 1 turret
creations-chat 2018-11-12 06:43:14 and my hull was too short in width
creations-chat 2018-11-12 06:44:03 i dont remember
creations-chat 2018-11-12 06:44:05 prob like
creations-chat 2018-11-12 06:44:24 15 blocks wide
creations-chat 2018-11-12 06:44:42 well
creations-chat 2018-11-12 06:44:44 the problem was
creations-chat 2018-11-12 06:44:48 when i then put down a motor
creations-chat 2018-11-12 06:45:07 i realized that i couldnt place my motor in the middle of the turret
creations-chat 2018-11-12 06:45:12 which basically means i was screwed
creations-chat 2018-11-12 06:45:21 even if i extended its width or made it shorter
creations-chat 2018-11-12 06:45:24 wouldnt work
creations-chat 2018-11-12 06:45:46 idk
creations-chat 2018-11-12 06:45:52 because i long since deleted it
creations-chat 2018-11-12 06:45:57 since i got stressed out on it
creations-chat 2018-11-12 06:47:39 i was going to personally build a fletcher class destroyer
creations-chat 2018-11-12 06:47:48 but the hull is quite hard
creations-chat 2018-11-12 06:47:59 because you cant tell if the underside of the hull is curved or flat
creations-chat 2018-11-12 06:49:15 i want to make a vtol now
creations-chat 2018-11-12 06:49:34 but i need the motors to lock and even though ive clicked the lock button it just doesnt
creations-chat 2018-11-12 06:49:58 i did like the motors for my rudders on my ship though
creations-chat 2018-11-12 06:54:38 what i do know is that i need to get the thrust in the same spot as the mass
creations-chat 2018-11-12 06:54:43 its like ksp
creations-chat 2018-11-12 06:54:56 and simple planes
creations-chat 2018-11-12 06:55:27 they need to add a center of thrust
creations-chat 2018-11-12 06:55:32 so that its much easier
creations-chat 2018-11-12 06:56:00 i was going to do a propellor vtol
creations-chat 2018-11-12 06:56:02 but hmm
creations-chat 2018-11-12 06:56:57 so basically its just
creations-chat 2018-11-12 06:57:01 test and see if it works
creations-chat 2018-11-12 06:57:12 and if it doesnt just move the engines to where it was moving
creations-chat 2018-11-12 06:58:02 like
creations-chat 2018-11-12 06:58:10 the only first major building i did was that learjet
creations-chat 2018-11-12 06:58:18 but its not actually a learjet since it was just so heavy
creations-chat 2018-11-12 12:52:28 Finally got a functional VTOL
