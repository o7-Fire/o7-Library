creations-chat 2022-05-10 01:22:14 why not
creations-chat 2022-05-10 01:24:44 Honestly itâ€™s not a bad build just could use a little detail
creations-chat 2022-05-10 19:33:24 Why did you go with the wooden signs?
creations-chat 2022-05-10 19:35:58 I was just asking, and it actually might actually be interesting to have a mech with a wooden theme
creations-chat 2022-05-12 00:11:27 Make the car very big
creations-chat 2022-05-12 00:13:40 I guess you could anglelock with wing panels or something but if you want them to be sort of freestanding like in the picture you might not be able to do that
