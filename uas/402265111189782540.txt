creations-chat 2020-09-16 05:14:27 hm ok
creations-chat 2020-09-16 05:14:38 ive been mistaken
creations-chat 2020-09-16 05:14:40 LOL
creations-chat 2020-09-16 05:14:51 i thought the conveyors were on 30 speed
creations-chat 2020-09-16 05:14:56 but they were clocked to the max LOL

creations-chat 2020-09-16 05:16:39 problem is
creations-chat 2020-09-16 05:16:48 its not measured by mph in game
creations-chat 2020-09-16 05:17:05 you do the math
creations-chat 2020-09-16 05:17:36 20 roblox studs is 1 meter
creations-chat 2020-09-16 05:18:07 well
creations-chat 2020-09-16 05:18:34 i mean
creations-chat 2020-09-16 05:18:46 the average robloxian is 5 studs tall
creations-chat 2020-09-16 05:18:51 10 inches
creations-chat 2020-09-16 05:18:57 about 10 inches
creations-chat 2020-09-16 05:19:15 this is from roblox
creations-chat 2020-09-16 05:19:21 According to the Roblox Blog, 1 meter is equal to 20 ROBLOX studs, so a stud is 5 centimeters, and a real-life ROBLOXian (that is 5 studs tall) would be 25 centimeters, about 10 inches tall.

creations-chat 2021-10-12 18:41:56 just because you sit for hours in game and learn nothing doesnt mean youll improve
you have to spend each hour trying new techniques and perfecting them

you have to strive for true perfection in every detail, from the wings to the gunpods or the rotor blade and everything in between
creations-chat 2021-10-12 18:44:31 i have a 1.3k block player scale f5e just so i can get every detail that i wanted to have on it

from the angled leading edge wing to the soviet star decal having a yellow outline
