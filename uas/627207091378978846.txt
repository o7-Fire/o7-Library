bug-reports 2020-12-28 01:36:31 I JUST WANT TO MAKE MY ROCKET NOT TIP OVER!!!
bug-reports 2020-12-28 01:37:05 I keep putting in 0.29 but it says 0.28
bug-reports 2020-12-28 05:32:12 Well coincidentally .29 is the number I need to stabilize the rocket. Plane crazy hates me and I don’t know why.
bug-reports 2020-12-28 05:32:49 Okay thanks for the advice
bug-reports 2020-12-28 21:15:47 Okay, why is it that EVERY time I load in the SAME rocket the damn ballasts decide they don’t give a shit about stabilizing my rocket?!
bug-reports 2020-12-28 21:51:01 I’m saying that when i configure a ballets to make my rocket not tip over when I load it back in it the rocket tips over
