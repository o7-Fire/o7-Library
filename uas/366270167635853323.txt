bug-reports 2021-11-25 20:56:13 im experiencing this bug with the saves where the sparklers change their direction when i load my build (they were arranged in the shape of a barrel when i saved my build)
bug-reports 2021-11-25 20:56:33 everytime i change their direction to how it was meant to be and save it it just happens again

creations-chat 2021-11-28 13:52:06 i keep the signs configure to edit so that i can see them while working on the build, once its finished, i edit them so that theyre invisible
