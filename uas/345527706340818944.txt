creations-chat 2021-01-05 11:54:41 Ah, sorry
creations-chat 2021-01-05 12:13:02 People who disliked my build: What should i change in order to change your mind :D
creations-chat 2021-01-05 12:16:20 Blocky nose i assume like harsnavary said? And it is a tailsitter, Has a stand to put it for a vertical takeoff. Ill remake the nose and try and get it as smooth as i can
creations-chat 2021-01-05 12:19:12 That's how the og one was launched though, but sure i can do that. Btw how can i make it more round?
creations-chat 2021-01-05 12:24:23 <@456226577798135808> Something like this?
creations-chat 2021-01-05 15:12:50 <@456226577798135808> <@!719168864705052802> Took your feedback and changed it. changed to cockpit almost entirly and i made the circle a little more round like the screenshot i posted earlier. Hope you like it more now!

creations-chat 2021-01-05 15:18:23 The problem is that i want to kinda stick to it being small and not too long like the real thing, I might try and remake the cockpit one more time however its a little tougher i'd say
creations-chat 2021-01-05 15:33:54 The original build of mine or the original jet itself? In any case i dont think it can be smaller and still look as round
creations-chat 2021-01-05 16:02:46 In any case i still cant realy make it smaller
bug-reports 2021-01-07 15:34:19 They dont always work
creations-chat 2021-01-10 10:49:11 <@!478314960565436417> Wait so it does a vertical take off, then a horizontal flight, then back to vertical?
creations-chat 2021-01-14 09:46:23 <@!712273624865701921> Maybe change the color of the f4 so it looks better in screenshots

creations-chat 2021-03-22 18:52:31 I'm not sure about making the wings with half blocks, but i did think of using piston lock to get 2 sides wings
creations-chat 2021-03-22 18:55:39 I never used it before but i can get more angles with it, idk if it will work smoothely though since the wing is also angled
creations-chat 2021-03-22 19:01:11 I can maybe do a wing like this, not sure how it will effect the plane though (Will also need a taller tower <:nooo:787097964946259978> )

creations-chat 2021-05-14 14:39:05 The colors are fine, talking about the layout of it
creations-chat 2021-05-14 14:45:15 Not saying you needed to add motor lock to it, just saying the layout is weird, i know the iranian f14 has choppy camo but yours has weird gaps in between.
creations-chat 2021-05-14 14:47:49 If you used alot of lock you can add custom camo too 🦍 🦍 🦍 besides on the folding wings since you cant
creations-chat 2021-05-14 14:51:36 Plus dont see why you're getting mad at me, giving feedback on camo. Shape looks fine
creations-chat 2021-05-14 14:56:49 Delta wing 1x1 is like half a normal wing, doesnt add weight plus you got enough extra space to attach it on the tower
creations-chat 2021-05-14 14:59:41 I just said that delta wing x1 is half a normal 1x1 wing, take 2 1x1 delta wings and it is like a normal one
creations-chat 2021-05-14 15:01:42 Both my f15's fly at the same speed. One with camo and one without. Almost no diffrence. Plus using hover engine so that already adds lag
creations-chat 2021-05-14 15:03:43 If you dont want to do custom camo its fine, just make it look a little better

creations-chat 2021-05-28 15:05:13 Not this, i meant that the angle lock you did to connect the top part looks weird. I would go with a flat cockpit top

creations-chat 2021-05-29 08:25:18 Reminds me of mine in a way, looks nice! Add camo though and maybe overlay a blueprint
creations-chat 2021-05-29 08:29:00 In this case some of the camo is wrong, nose needs to be black like 33 33 33 and the belly at around 190 190 190
creations-chat 2021-05-29 09:39:09 <@627813759427018752> cockpit is supposed to be the same level as the rest of the plane, color isnt that good, small intake, wings look weird, the motor flaps for the tail look weird and point out. I suggest overlaying it with a harrier blueprint
creations-chat 2021-05-29 10:07:45 Why did he even add contro surfaces to the tail if he already had a motor flap

You could have done just 1 anglelock in the nose, chose to do like 40 and its still not a good looking circle. Same with the engine
creations-chat 2021-07-27 20:41:50 Forgot to mention that weird cockpit, why not use cylinders? Looks much smoother with them

creations-chat 2021-07-31 14:24:24 That would look bad, try moving the motorlock down somehow and then elevate what's left with piston lock i guess
creations-chat 2021-07-31 14:26:51 There's a way to do seamless lock but you need a 1x5 space

creations-chat 2021-09-23 12:24:53 That rounds up to 26.57
creations-chat 2021-09-23 22:35:35 bad gear, blocky engines, weird black cockpit, elevators look weird too and are angled up for some reason
creations-chat 2021-09-23 22:40:01 stock gear just looks bad on it, also they have angled elevators that go down/flat on vtols, not up
creations-chat 2021-09-24 21:36:42 you wanted us to make our own custom jets or something
creations-chat 2021-09-24 21:41:09 we are creative with how we build the irl planes <:FineTroll:626841259746656289>
creations-chat 2021-09-24 21:43:45 designed my version actually yes, there's no israeli camo on the actuall F-15 MTD
creations-chat 2021-09-24 21:45:55 its done in the music industry too and in other industries though, taking a sample and putting your own stuff into it making it completely new although you can still see the original piece in it
creations-chat 2021-09-24 21:47:58 making custom jets can look like shit too, what's the problem with making jets that already exist and are known
creations-chat 2021-09-24 21:50:34 its a shredder ball that has a gun that can move behind its back, i dont see whats so good about it
creations-chat 2021-09-24 21:53:08 still a flying ball that has a moving gun
creations-chat 2021-09-24 21:55:48 can you show a video of what it does? it just looks like a weird thing
creations-chat 2021-09-24 21:58:10 best
creations-chat 2021-09-24 22:00:55 man thinks building jets that arent original is bad and sweaty
creations-chat 2021-09-24 22:05:01 That's just a shredder ball lmao
creations-chat 2021-09-24 22:07:49 no cutters but it has the same functionality and a shredder ball with the guns
creations-chat 2021-09-24 22:09:54 same functionality, all shredder balls have a moving gun like that
creations-chat 2021-09-24 22:12:08 you said its original, its not.

<@!622667339825020928> they can still move backwards and forward and aim the gun back
creations-chat 2021-09-24 22:17:28 what's the problem with them being common? having a game where you can build everything includes fighter jets. if you dont like it then cope ig
creations-chat 2021-09-24 23:27:13 Try the IAI Kfir, much better mirage 5
creations-chat 2021-09-24 23:29:44 Im the F-15 with the camo and canards and dash is the one with the draken
creations-chat 2021-09-24 23:31:45 The IAI Kfir is an upgraded mirage 5 though <:m_:778994206948589638> <:m_:778994206948589638> <:m_:778994206948589638>
creations-chat 2021-09-24 23:34:08 Its not even a mirage at that point, the entire mirage series has delta wings and thats what makes them special, adding elevators and normal wings kinda throws it off
creations-chat 2021-09-24 23:37:02 IAI Kfir tc2 is a twin seater, also i think the mirage 3 also had a twin varient. Mirage 5 just has newer avionics and a longer
creations-chat 2021-09-24 23:41:15 Looks great so far, moving intakes?
creations-chat 2021-09-24 23:43:40 <@676970337770012683> vertical stabilizer is too small, paint needs more work on imo, back can be smoother

<@580430817550139442> the intakes on the f15 move up and down for airflow
creations-chat 2021-09-24 23:46:05 <@580430817550139442> 
https://youtu.be/ZkYqDYuH4uo

Look in 0:44 

<@676970337770012683> why are the elevators higher then the wings? The f15's elevators are supposed to be lower and the wings higher
creations-chat 2021-09-24 23:49:09 Ofc you dont need to add it, just thought the intakes move on yours since they look angled
creations-chat 2021-09-25 15:06:20 <@559568621312147476> cockpit interior can be better
creations-chat 2021-09-25 16:53:05 <@725358947904651335> i copyright you 😡

creations-chat 2021-09-25 21:49:29 it needs another angle going down
creations-chat 2021-09-25 23:22:35 Where is it from 🤔 🤔 🤔 🤔
creations-chat 2021-09-27 13:54:03 looks weird
creations-chat 2021-09-27 14:58:28 Intake, colors, wings, vertical stabilizer. It just looks like you gave up after the nose and cockpit
creations-chat 2021-09-27 15:33:25 Meant both stabilizers. Also it just looks weird
creations-chat 2021-09-27 15:35:28 Why is there so much empty space in the tracks? Unless you havent got to that yet

creations-chat 2021-11-30 18:47:46 <@736224154105151569> vertical stabilizers look too big and close, cockpit and spine should be higher and the cockpit looks funny, same with the wings
Not to mention intakes
creations-chat 2021-11-30 18:50:15 They're not that small, I've seen better su-27's in that scale and lower that look better

creations-chat 2021-12-18 14:29:16 Because it looks like a tube maybe? You realy can't add anything to it unless you remake it
creations-chat 2021-12-18 14:32:42 No idea why you turned it into a fight when I just gave simple feedback 
If you want I can give you feedback like you want
Try adding some more detail to it like a spine and those exsust things on the nose. Try reducing the speed since although it's not a realistic game you can try and make it a little nicer
😁

creations-chat 2021-12-23 21:17:25 Hey guys, just wanted to wish you all happy holidays. Discord is filled with ready-made messages that you don't even read, you just copy and paste to every server, I don't like that, I like writing from my heart. Our friendship, from the deepest to virtual, is very important to me and couldn't ever be represented by a cookie-cutter message from anywhere. So, I'd like to thank you all, you're the best furry roleplaying server I've ever interacted with.

creations-chat 2022-01-05 22:21:51 <@750712383227428945> elevators are too big, wings are too swept back, cockpit should be more far back, vertical stabilizers are too high, detail can be better too as well

creations-chat 2022-02-04 10:10:05 Yeah hard to fit with that style of building, My best suggestion rn is to make the front gear. Mine is exposed and I can't hide it which is super annoying

events-chat 2022-02-04 16:44:47 They're gonna die the fastest I think, they won't be able to point their plane well enough since it's just too menuvarable
events-chat 2022-02-04 16:46:00 It sucks there are mostly tryhard jets in this event too, it could have been so fun to see a prop pvp battle
events-chat 2022-02-04 16:46:33 Yes but I think people limit those stuff more
events-chat 2022-02-04 16:47:06 I get that, it's due to the speed though. No jet gonna be dogfighting at such low speeds
events-chat 2022-02-04 16:48:22 I get that, I'm saying in a more realistic way
events-chat 2022-02-04 16:48:38 I wish the mods limited the menuvarbility or have it at least semi realistic
events-chat 2022-02-04 16:49:09 Not have planes doing 10 full 360's in less then a second
events-chat 2022-02-04 16:49:42 Based on how it seems in a video
events-chat 2022-02-04 16:50:31 I don't want to see an entire pvp match just being a recreation of nam's pvp montages
events-chat 2022-02-04 16:51:32 Control surfaces in the nose > propeller
events-chat 2022-02-04 16:52:22 It's good as well since if you put too much control surfaces in the nose you lose speed + gain alot of lift so it has to be limited
events-chat 2022-02-04 16:53:54 Plus if people make jets why not make old ones to it fits <:nooo:787097964946259978> <:nooo:787097964946259978> <:nooo:787097964946259978>

creations-chat 2022-05-26 20:55:14 its good but thats one of the ugliest plane designs ive seen

also what is magnet lock
creations-chat 2022-05-26 20:59:50 the u7 has a shit design but heresom made it really well
creations-chat 2022-05-26 21:04:02 but its glass
creations-chat 2022-05-26 21:14:15 oh so in that way you can just remove motors you used for angles, like if i were to angle harrier wings and they would usually be exposed i just angle them and disconect the motors
creations-chat 2022-05-26 21:17:27 is the black cube in the back the magnet

<@354280132569071616> we know what m lock is now 😈
creations-chat 2022-05-26 21:19:32 I just never thought magnets could hold parts like a lock, always thought it was gonna glitch out like if you were to lock something with a normal piston
creations-chat 2022-05-26 21:21:38 rope lock 😎

creations-chat 2022-07-01 14:53:47 The Grumman F-14 Tomcat is an American carrier-capable supersonic, twin-engine, two-seat, twin-tail, variable-sweep wing fighter aircraft. The Tomcat was developed for the United States Navy's Naval Fighter Experimental (VFX) program after the collapse of the General Dynamics-Grumman F-111B project. The F-14 was the first of the American Teen Series fighters, which were designed incorporating air combat experience against MiG fighters during the Vietnam War.
