creations-chat 2023-01-27 14:18:40 If you couldn't motorlock, what sort of builds would you make?
creations-chat 2023-01-29 16:47:39 Ok serious question
People who put " custom" before a build name, why?
creations-chat 2023-01-31 07:49:14 <@668314196764655618> idk if it's the most stable but it's the most compact other than U engines (a H engine split in half) for the number of cylinders and hovers u can pack in and the torque is easily measurable as it doesn't stall or require flywheels. Torque is also scalable as you can easily stack hovers

creations-chat 2023-02-01 11:42:23 <@670101431071801384> it's most likely lag since there isn't much resistance for there to be much torque
creations-chat 2023-02-01 15:40:00 <@704802826659954722> I agree

Be brave, be honest to yourself and stop this trush talkings!!! Everybody know that i am very good blitz player, i can win anyone in the world in single game! And "w"esley "s"o is nobody for me, just a player who are crying every single time when loosing, ( remember what you say about Firouzja ) !!! Stop playing with my name, i deserve to have a good name during whole my chess carrier, I am Officially inviting you to OTB blitz match with the Prize fund! Both of us will invest 5000$ and winner takes it all!
