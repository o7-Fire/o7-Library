creations-chat 2021-08-28 22:32:16 DM me if you wanna rate my Heli
creations-chat 2021-08-28 22:41:52 Hence why I asked for feedback, Ik there isn't a tail rotor, but it is a coaxial rotation, a thing modern helis have, also, <@!287454032250011649> I know it isnt a Apache, but It is based off of a Ah-64, just extremely low poly
creations-chat 2021-08-28 22:45:49 <@!711009848438947850>  aight lemme make a change you seem so nitpicky
creations-chat 2021-08-28 22:49:42 <@!711009848438947850>  nice, better than mine, but like.... I still have more to learn for this game, I'm sorry I mistitled a heli, but like holy shit
creations-chat 2021-08-28 22:52:42 That isn't your build

You seem like you are having a bad day, wanna talk about it? You seem upset

Also <@!711009848438947850> I will repeat again, I'm not the best builder, and oop I'm so sorry I mistitled a heli

And yeah I am new to the server
creations-chat 2021-08-28 22:55:55 Also idc too much, cause first of all, oh no got called bad by someone on the internet, not just that, but also like... My heli functions really well, its a beast at pvp. 

Aight if anyone can make it and it's easy, why dont I see any? I have only seen 1, and it was meh 

I saw it in a pvp server, it went 200 speed and had a turret, only real good aspect was the agility, it could do flips and rolls
creations-chat 2021-08-28 23:02:32 Damn thats crazy, also I still dont give a fuck, imma go from this argument cause its le internet, idgaf

bug-reports 2021-08-29 05:24:07 He said "railgun" now can't use chat
creations-chat 2021-08-29 18:51:14 Is this heli alright? It's not the best, but I'm proud of it. (pardon the bad pvp, I normally do good)
creations-chat 2021-08-29 19:08:25 Oh I know it's fast, I have a slower variant, but normally when I am playing for a while, I dominate, in that I got back on and it takes me a bit to get used to the sort of aim for the rockets. <@!725185242973077545> I know, but I like the heli cause I can slow down and be precise, not just that, it makes people pissed cause they see me go slow and pull out a jet, only for me to outspeed them
creations-chat 2021-08-29 20:42:57 Hehe hotdog glock

creations-chat 2021-08-29 21:01:27 Props are small cause this was my first alright build so I didnt make actual props, I just used giants, And yeah the wings are fat, but if I thin them they disproportionate
creations-chat 2021-10-23 23:17:29 Clarify please
creations-chat 2021-10-23 23:26:10 can we have link? Cause of what I could test, it was just better tracking, less damage for the non legacy
creations-chat 2021-10-23 23:36:04 Are motors broken? They seem to drift.

When the motor is horizontal, like lifting an panel for a plane's pitch, it is fine, but vertically, like turning a turret, it drifts

help 2021-10-25 23:13:57 wdym
help 2021-10-25 23:17:13 What makes it cursed? The pit?
help 2021-10-25 23:18:59 Here is the funny, the entire reason to all those problems, is cause the tail is good, the rest makes it bad
help 2021-10-25 23:19:15 The tail I did *mwah* perfect, the rest of the build is so heavily disproportionate
help 2021-10-25 23:20:33 bruh im sorry but like how is that average? It seems so much less if that makes sense
help 2021-10-25 23:20:41 Like at the same time this server is picky as hell
help 2021-10-25 23:20:47 So idk
help 2021-10-25 23:22:51 Ah ok
help 2021-10-25 23:22:57 Also is the conv drive buggy at all?
help 2021-10-25 23:23:37 Ah ok, clarify please 😳
help 2021-10-25 23:24:03 Here is the perfect tail
help 2021-10-25 23:24:13 I can get the 3d model to show what I mean by proportionate
help 2021-10-25 23:24:33 Howsat
help 2021-10-25 23:25:27 
help 2021-10-25 23:25:30 1x2s
help 2021-10-25 23:26:28 yeah, its like half done, its more of a F4 Phantom II
help 2021-10-25 23:27:43 this the model Im using
help 2021-10-25 23:28:15 Yeah
help 2021-10-25 23:28:18 Im redoing it
help 2021-10-25 23:28:21 The tail Im keeping
help 2021-10-25 23:28:33 But imma just not do the funny motorlock cones
help 2021-10-25 23:28:38 Those take up too much space and make it fat
help 2021-10-25 23:29:59 no the motorlocks are 3x3
help 2021-10-25 23:30:04 And if Im making the jet
help 2021-10-25 23:30:09 The cones are at most... 2x2
help 2021-10-25 23:30:22 Cause that is the entire size
help 2021-10-25 23:30:28 from a cross section
help 2021-10-25 23:30:41 The gray
help 2021-10-25 23:30:41 The cone
help 2021-10-25 23:30:44 That is 3x3
help 2021-10-25 23:30:46 See?
help 2021-10-25 23:30:55 Its too big to fit into the right place
help 2021-10-25 23:31:01 Without just being easier and better looking to use rocket
help 2021-10-25 23:31:19 Therefore, my postulated opinion upon this matter is indubitably correct
help 2021-10-25 23:32:36 Yeah, I feel that would be too much for it
help 2021-10-25 23:51:29 yeah
help 2021-10-25 23:51:33 Imma redo it
help 2021-10-26 00:52:17 No my issue is just the proportions, I couldn't get a proportionate shape, making the tail look super skinnym and yeah, im fixxing it rn tho
help 2021-10-26 00:52:20 Thank you btw
help 2021-10-26 03:04:22 Oh thats a really bad belt
help 2021-10-26 03:04:31 Use Half Wedge Down
help 2021-10-26 03:04:37 And make it so the flat side is always facing out
help 2021-10-26 03:05:02 I can also show you some other stuff like teething the belt so it sticks and does not slide
help 2021-10-26 03:05:19 And for the belt, yeah add more wheels for better force/shape, and use suspension to push the belt out, dont use pistons
creations-chat 2021-10-26 03:42:07 <@!659949580041060362>  Ayo is that Ronin or Northstar

help 2021-11-01 06:21:06 I kinda did a brokey, I used a magnet to try and see if I could weld using an unpowered motor, and it kinda just works like brakes to a car
creations-chat 2021-11-01 06:45:26 I already did some water wheel stuff, I didnt like how they didnt really work

<@!882419947819638825>  Cosmetically?
creations-chat 2021-11-01 06:50:47 Cosmetic though? Cause like, no way in hell am I gonna make a piston engine (flat to rotational movement) and then translate it into gears
creations-chat 2021-11-01 06:55:14 Like yeah it is possible (I just need to learn a piston engine, cause plane crazy has sh*t physics sometimes) and whatnot, but ehh
creations-chat 2021-11-01 21:36:24 Yeah

help 2021-11-28 06:04:55 So that I can load multiple shots?
help 2021-11-28 06:05:06 Cause I either want a crossbow, or some howitzer like thing
help 2021-11-28 06:12:45 Well that seems very violent, I like the idea, but anchors and ropes are very buggy
help 2021-11-28 06:13:31 If possible, tell me a good way to make artillery, I wanna make a artillery sight (a sight that as you angle the cannon, the actual point will go to where it lands, with proper calibration) and I want it to (possibly) be mobile
help 2021-11-28 06:13:41 I want a motorlock reload based, artillery cannon
help 2021-11-28 06:13:45 I just need to cannon aspect
help 2021-11-28 06:13:49 I got the reload
help 2021-11-28 06:14:06 Just compress, the motorlock, with the motors power, with 0 speed, and diff segments to different binds
help 2021-11-28 06:14:07 So...
help 2021-11-28 06:14:11 You press the bind
help 2021-11-28 06:14:15 and only one round expands out
help 2021-11-28 06:14:20 you disconnect it
help 2021-11-28 06:14:27 And the expanded lock will be disconnected
help 2021-11-28 06:14:33 So the round and the jacket in a way
help 2021-11-28 06:14:37 Thanks
help 2021-11-28 06:15:49 Also
help 2021-11-28 06:15:54 With the lack of magnets for actually firing
help 2021-11-28 06:16:01 Im fine with using it to assist the mechanism
help 2021-11-28 06:16:05 But.. no magnet gun
help 2021-11-28 06:16:06 Thats lame
help 2021-11-29 01:25:32 Funny Factoid, Magnets with weld, can break the weld
help 2021-11-29 01:25:36 You know what this means?
help 2021-11-29 01:25:41 Reloading Crossbow
help 2021-11-29 01:25:49 It takes 6 blocks for the mechanism
help 2021-11-29 01:26:24 
help 2021-11-29 01:27:09 Its just a magnet with whatever bindings, set it to max range, strength, weld, superstrength, 🗿  and toggle, and diff bindings on the rope
help 2021-11-29 01:27:16 Just make the magnet pull, extend the rope
help 2021-11-29 01:27:51 Uhm
help 2021-11-29 01:27:52 UIhhh
help 2021-11-29 01:27:54 Uhhhhhhhh

help 2021-11-29 03:00:19 Also sorry about video length and lack of audio, I forgot to turn on desktop audio
help 2021-11-29 03:03:24 I use the magnet to weld the rope, pull the rope back, and then untoggle the magnet, breaking the weld
help 2021-11-29 03:03:38 Because of the power based on the suspension, I could prolly make a railgun
help 2021-11-29 03:03:45 So guess what I'm making
help 2021-12-02 01:06:17 Uhhh why do I not get shot out? I just kinda boink thru it, or impale into the rope

help 2021-12-03 02:38:10 Oh shit I wasnt using 3d
help 2021-12-03 02:38:12 lol
help 2021-12-03 02:39:40 Back to the frame thing
help 2021-12-03 02:39:47 Should I make a frame for the cockpit?
help 2021-12-03 02:39:52 Or just glass motorlocking
help 2021-12-03 02:40:56 But what about sloping
help 2021-12-03 02:40:59 Hmmm
help 2021-12-03 02:41:05 I am very torn here
help 2021-12-03 02:41:16 Angle locking with cams? Or motors
help 2021-12-03 02:41:43 Also you know that really light slope that Half wedge 1x2 has? There is an issue I have, the bottom
help 2021-12-03 02:41:52 Is there the same slope, but with a bottom?
help 2021-12-03 02:45:10 Like for the blue
help 2021-12-03 02:45:34 And the red
help 2021-12-03 02:45:40 The red, should I ignore such a minor slope?
help 2021-12-03 02:47:33 Ok
help 2021-12-03 02:47:37 Thanks btw for all the help
help 2021-12-03 02:48:00 And being patient through my dumbassery
help 2021-12-03 02:48:35 What about the red now?
help 2021-12-03 02:49:03 The front, I guess motorlock down a half wedge up 1x2 together to make the front
help 2021-12-03 02:49:14 So it makes a really long cutter sorta shape
help 2021-12-03 02:49:43 Ok
help 2021-12-03 02:50:10 Should I do that? Angle the upper part
help 2021-12-03 02:50:20 The red is a little too flat for a 1x4
help 2021-12-03 02:51:38 Yeah
help 2021-12-03 02:52:40 I wanna make a heli that looks good, so far my helis I have made I kinda sorta maybe just a little prioritized movement over looks, and ended up with uhm
help 2021-12-03 02:54:42 Ok so I have a thought
help 2021-12-03 02:54:44 For the red
help 2021-12-03 02:54:47 What if I ignore that
help 2021-12-03 02:55:25 Cause I checked it, the best possible slope I could get without just using motors, it was too steep when lining up with the blueprint
help 2021-12-03 03:02:42 For the heli, Im not doing the tail in full
help 2021-12-03 03:02:47 I dont like making tail rotors
help 2021-12-03 03:03:03 And... The props if I make up to the size that would allow a proportionate tail
help 2021-12-03 03:03:18 It cannot lift it off the ground, not even the half assed not finished version I got so far
help 2021-12-03 03:04:52 Camerlock is bald cause I have to lock it every time I load the save, and motor tilt? I dont like using modors to tild
help 2021-12-03 03:05:17 Like what
help 2021-12-03 03:05:33 The music? The flight? the heli itself?
help 2021-12-03 03:05:44 issue, I'd forget
help 2021-12-03 03:06:11 Also, if I move the build up or down, the positioning gets screwed when I spawn
help 2021-12-03 03:06:47 Like I used it for a diff plane, and it was in a way, hardcoded, not actually, but I could not raise it to add stuff
help 2021-12-03 03:06:49 Or lower it
help 2021-12-03 03:06:56 Also, I get that, but, having to aim
help 2021-12-03 03:06:59 I get the gist tho
help 2021-12-03 03:07:36 Not actual aim
help 2021-12-03 03:07:44 But imagine forgetting what block it was
help 2021-12-03 03:07:51 Like the camera aiming at the block
help 2021-12-03 03:08:17 Well imagine I get shot down in pvp
help 2021-12-03 03:08:20 Oh wait
help 2021-12-03 03:08:21 Yeah
help 2021-12-03 03:08:27 If I were to close game and rejoin
help 2021-12-03 03:08:30 Say I join pvp server
help 2021-12-03 03:08:36 I wanna compare builds
help 2021-12-03 03:08:44 Shhhhh just let me have an exxcuse
help 2021-12-03 03:09:11 What if I forget which camera it was
help 2021-12-03 03:09:13 What if uhhh
help 2021-12-03 03:09:17 Im running out of ideas
help 2021-12-03 03:09:24 What if I have a really internalized camera
help 2021-12-03 03:09:28 Like super far in
help 2021-12-03 03:09:33 Of the bits and pieces
help 2021-12-03 03:10:20 i guess
help 2021-12-03 03:10:43 I just dont like camera locking, too complicated, and there is the thing I said about the movement
help 2021-12-03 03:11:04 God Damnit
help 2021-12-03 03:11:07 Yeah
help 2021-12-03 03:11:15 One question, do you have it where when you raise the build
help 2021-12-03 03:11:21 The locking gets screwy?
help 2021-12-03 03:11:30 Cause whenever I raised or lowered a build
help 2021-12-03 03:11:34 The camera locking get screwed
help 2021-12-03 03:11:42 Not repointing, but like, the height
help 2021-12-03 03:11:46 Will be off
help 2021-12-03 03:11:51 And pointing it dont do nothing
help 2021-12-03 03:12:01 Yeah
help 2021-12-03 03:12:19 wait that works
help 2021-12-03 03:12:21 fucking hell
help 2021-12-03 03:12:31 I woulda finished a nice f4 phantom
help 2021-12-03 03:12:39 but I gave up cause I had to stuff a motorlock beneath it
help 2021-12-03 03:12:48 hm
help 2021-12-03 03:12:56 And are camera locks a feature?
help 2021-12-03 03:13:14 No cause I never thought it was binded before I spawned in
help 2021-12-03 03:13:19 I thought it only binded after spawning
help 2021-12-03 03:13:29 Cause when I would load, the cameras would face straight, then tilt
help 2021-12-03 03:16:43 Well what else is it
help 2021-12-03 03:16:44 Speed?
help 2021-12-03 03:16:50 Maneuverability?
help 2021-12-03 03:16:53 It kinda, moves
help 2021-12-03 03:16:55 Good that is
help 2021-12-03 03:17:21 And is exceptionally good at making children say "My dad was in the [insert military branch] and that is an insult to him"
help 2021-12-03 03:17:29 And that it isnt realistic
help 2021-12-03 03:17:42 And then saying real men use [insert tutorial Ah-1]
help 2021-12-03 03:27:26 Also do you guys have it where when you use the copy and paste feature, when you have boblox running, your computers ability to copy and paste just no worky
help 2021-12-03 03:27:30 like it no let me paste
help 2021-12-03 03:27:48 I hate it
help 2021-12-03 03:27:57 Cause I dont wanna save all the images

help 2021-12-03 03:43:10 It just feels, like a piece of paper
help 2021-12-03 03:43:15 It is nice length wise
help 2021-12-03 03:43:29 But I feel like even just making it a half block on each side thicker would make it better
help 2021-12-03 03:43:48 May I recieve verification from fellow zoomers on the interweb
help 2021-12-03 03:48:39 But like
help 2021-12-03 03:48:49 If I go wider people are like "attack helicockters are thin"
help 2021-12-03 03:48:51 Like bro
help 2021-12-03 03:48:56 If you look at my other heli
help 2021-12-03 03:49:06 I add one block and thats the main criticism it gets
help 2021-12-03 03:49:07 too wide
help 2021-12-03 03:51:05 I might just save this as like a concept heli, I did like the intakes
help 2021-12-03 03:51:09 And I like the idea
help 2021-12-03 03:51:16 But I really am just looking to make a nice looking heli

the-dump 2021-12-12 00:14:06 What else do I need to explain?
the-dump 2021-12-12 00:14:50 Does this even come close to the same power as a shovel?
the-dump 2021-12-12 00:15:16 But the weapon I described is a landmine
the-dump 2021-12-12 00:15:18 You throw it
the-dump 2021-12-12 00:15:22 Really violently
the-dump 2021-12-12 00:15:24 And super hard
the-dump 2021-12-12 00:15:34 No
the-dump 2021-12-12 00:15:40 Its a Rocket Propelled Grenade
the-dump 2021-12-12 00:15:48 Not RPL
the-dump 2021-12-12 00:15:53 Not really
the-dump 2021-12-12 00:15:55 They use fuel
the-dump 2021-12-12 00:15:59 A landmine has no fuel
the-dump 2021-12-12 00:16:15 That is fuel
the-dump 2021-12-12 00:16:30 It is fine if it is a trebuchet, the better siege machine
the-dump 2021-12-12 00:16:39 If you can find me a trebuchet loaded with a shovel
the-dump 2021-12-12 00:16:46 You win and your argument is valid
the-dump 2021-12-12 00:16:51 I have yet to find one
the-dump 2021-12-12 00:17:03 That is close
the-dump 2021-12-12 00:17:06 But not enough
the-dump 2021-12-12 00:17:22 Cause that is a shoddy looking bow
the-dump 2021-12-12 00:17:27 if it is a compound bow
the-dump 2021-12-12 00:17:30 I will accept it
the-dump 2021-12-12 00:18:28 I have another question, what about other tools
the-dump 2021-12-12 00:18:35 Are only shovels the most powerful weapons?
the-dump 2021-12-12 00:18:37 Or....
the-dump 2021-12-12 00:18:39 Are there others
the-dump 2021-12-12 00:18:50 Cause like, this isn't a tool, but it is a weapon
the-dump 2021-12-12 00:18:54 Well
the-dump 2021-12-12 00:18:57 hmmm
the-dump 2021-12-12 00:19:00 Bigger Shovel?

the-dump 2021-12-12 00:19:21 this is the most powerful weapon
the-dump 2021-12-12 00:19:23 The big shovel
the-dump 2021-12-12 00:19:28 Wait
the-dump 2021-12-12 00:19:30 WAIT

the-dump 2021-12-12 00:20:48 This truck

the-dump 2021-12-12 00:20:54 Can be a shovel
the-dump 2021-12-12 00:21:07

the-dump 2021-12-12 00:21:51 Round Shovel?
the-dump 2021-12-12 00:21:59 Cup? Small round shovel?
the-dump 2021-12-12 00:22:11

the-dump 2021-12-12 00:23:18 Virtually everything one way or another can work as a shovel
the-dump 2021-12-12 00:23:23 Yeah
the-dump 2021-12-12 00:23:24 Wait
the-dump 2021-12-12 00:23:38 If virtually everything is a shovel... Are shovels really that powerful?
the-dump 2021-12-12 00:23:58 Like... A gun can be used as a shovel
the-dump 2021-12-12 00:24:05 Open the round eject, and you can dig
the-dump 2021-12-12 00:24:16 You can use a F-35 wing panel as a shovel
the-dump 2021-12-12 00:24:24 A bayonet is a funny shovel
the-dump 2021-12-12 00:24:44 So shovels aren't as powerful as we think...
the-dump 2021-12-12 00:24:58

help 2021-12-18 02:32:32 Ayo should I make the "Bolte" from BF2042?
help 2021-12-18 02:54:06 Hence why I am asking, I dont trust myself, so I need others to trust myself
help 2021-12-18 02:54:53 Uhh do you want the simplest system? Or do you want cool
help 2021-12-18 02:55:05 Simple would be to split the axle, and put the steering there
help 2021-12-18 02:55:13 The hardest but coolest is Rack and pinion
help 2021-12-18 02:55:17 It'd be bulky doe
help 2021-12-18 02:55:19 But cool
help 2021-12-18 02:55:30 I assume the car is for functionality not pvp
help 2021-12-18 02:55:32 Or speed
help 2021-12-18 02:55:48 Ah
help 2021-12-18 02:55:53 Make a remote steering system
help 2021-12-18 02:55:55 Make a wire
help 2021-12-18 02:56:00 From the wheel
help 2021-12-18 02:56:06 That wont spin with the wheel
help 2021-12-18 02:56:12 And hook up the wire (trails)
help 2021-12-18 02:56:16 To a steering mechanism
help 2021-12-18 02:56:18 So its like
help 2021-12-18 02:56:22 Or
help 2021-12-18 02:56:25 Split the axle
help 2021-12-18 02:56:28 and steer that way
help 2021-12-18 02:56:33 Like turning the whole mechanism
help 2021-12-18 02:56:34 On the front
help 2021-12-18 02:57:42 Lemme see the whole build
help 2021-12-18 02:57:46 Like the whole thingy

help 2021-12-18 02:58:12 Send thingy so I can see if work
help 2021-12-18 02:59:23 If you do six wheels, make the wheel set (like the pair side and side) that has the most ground drive force be the steering
help 2021-12-18 02:59:26 Like tank steering
help 2021-12-18 02:59:34 So that the rest which have weaker force
help 2021-12-18 02:59:41 Will cumulatively work more effective
help 2021-12-18 02:59:47 As is steers
help 2021-12-18 02:59:51 Or make it tank steerings
help 2021-12-18 02:59:59 Where instead of it being S and W
help 2021-12-18 03:00:11 Make it one side A and W and the other D and W
help 2021-12-18 03:00:17 I forgot which order tho in the motor itself
help 2021-12-18 03:01:08 Then take the front wheels
help 2021-12-18 03:01:09 And uhm
help 2021-12-18 03:01:12 Make em turn
help 2021-12-18 03:01:19 Make it so the front section
help 2021-12-18 03:01:23 Plate and all
help 2021-12-18 03:01:26 Are attached to motor
help 2021-12-18 03:01:27 So they steer
help 2021-12-18 03:01:32 Thats simplest and easiest
help 2021-12-18 03:01:36 And most discrete

help 2022-01-09 06:54:59 And problem with rudder
help 2022-01-09 06:55:03 It dont work well enough
creations-chat 2022-01-09 07:03:53 Its got the chonk though of Ion, the bulk, yeah, the girth if you say, it cant be ogre because the limbs dont fit, so an atlas chassis is closest, if you wanted to, make a weapon thats a seperate thing by using magnets to hold it in the hand with weld allowing it to stay, if it has the right dexterity to aim
creations-chat 2022-01-09 07:07:19 Something you could do for it is make a modular backpack system, using weld, make a sorta clothes hanger rack you position the mech into, and rotate the rack to what backpack, and it can be different backpacks, a flying pack, say a turret backpack, maybe an extra set of arms, etc

creations-chat 2022-02-10 04:54:48 Thanks man
creations-chat 2022-02-10 05:26:21 Yeah I tried doing the limbs

I did motor 2's at max angle setting, and then had the suspension, but I wasnt able to get it to work well, it just would not push it
creations-chat 2022-02-10 05:29:58 If I do that then it's less of my design, I could make a limb based bow, but the motor rope will get funky, and prolly ruin the power

If I add any more suspension the rope goes sicko mode

And the bow loses all power
creations-chat 2022-02-10 05:32:27 Really big ribcage, also how do you plan to make it move without exposed locks

Like I assume you are motorlocking, so they'd be shown

<@!660019099430289418> Yessir
creations-chat 2022-02-10 05:35:31 Wdym by help, Like motorlokcing helps with compressing funiies, but that skeleton makes it hard to make it mobile and look good

help 2022-02-18 04:58:20 Is this heli to be considered butter?
help 2022-02-18 04:58:52 For the landing that is and the non speed flight

help 2022-02-18 05:01:43 The entire thing would, explosive blocks dont just harm a section like guns do, they harm the whole thing, and imagine trying to line that up, thats wayyyy to hard
help 2022-02-18 05:02:14 An idea for that is to take a smoke pipe and motorlock it inwards like half a block
help 2022-02-18 05:02:21 Really?
help 2022-02-18 05:02:27 Oh
help 2022-02-18 05:02:40 Well you can use a smoke pipe and not have to worry about the inner part of jet engine

help 2022-02-21 19:32:30 What about this
help 2022-02-21 19:32:41 Also how do I put wheels in those wheel wells
help 2022-02-21 19:32:43 Cause like
help 2022-02-21 19:32:46 a 1x1 is too small
help 2022-02-21 19:32:51 And a 2x2 is too beeg
help 2022-02-21 19:46:19 So that a lip is created from the half cylinders?
help 2022-02-21 19:48:44 Cant really tell you painted it like the ground.
help 2022-02-21 19:49:05 And the angle doesnt work well for it
help 2022-02-21 19:49:42 Very disproportionate looking, I haven't seen star wars in a while so I might be wrong, but it looks off
help 2022-02-21 19:49:48 Too long I think
help 2022-02-21 19:49:58 And you need that phat afterburner effect behind it
help 2022-02-21 19:49:59 yknow
help 2022-02-21 19:50:18 Use trails with really small lifetime and no transparency
help 2022-02-21 19:50:35 Like 0.06 lifetime
help 2022-02-21 19:50:50 Seems kinda common, and the paint is too bright
help 2022-02-21 19:50:57 Make it like a flat white
help 2022-02-21 19:51:00 not shiny white
help 2022-02-21 19:51:05 Like 200 200 200
help 2022-02-21 19:51:11 Cause the paint is hard to see detail

help 2022-02-21 19:55:05 I have made a few
help 2022-02-21 19:55:09 Aight
help 2022-02-21 19:55:22 For the pitch control
help 2022-02-21 19:55:26 Like up and down tilt
help 2022-02-21 19:55:29 Use props in the back
help 2022-02-21 19:55:32 With motorlocking
help 2022-02-21 19:56:13 If you want to make the heli go fast like 500, Use a ratio of 2 to 3 propellers counter thrusting the force of each super rocket you use, this will cause mostly stable and level flight while going fast
help 2022-02-21 19:56:28 Also, if you attach guns to the sides like arms, put wing panels in those arms with motorlocking
help 2022-02-21 19:56:32 ye?
help 2022-02-21 19:56:33 Not really
help 2022-02-21 19:56:41 Whysat
help 2022-02-21 19:56:43 Ok
help 2022-02-21 19:56:47 So here is a pro tip
help 2022-02-21 19:56:50 Build a shell
help 2022-02-21 19:56:51 Of the heli
help 2022-02-21 19:56:56 And then take the empty space
help 2022-02-21 19:57:00 And put a motorlock in
help 2022-02-21 19:57:07 And then put the functionality of the heli
help 2022-02-21 19:57:11 Like what I stated above
help 2022-02-21 19:57:24 It wont be the hottest looking heli compared to locked helis
help 2022-02-21 19:57:33 But it will be able to fly good
help 2022-02-21 19:58:01 this is one of my helis
help 2022-02-21 19:58:29 Ye
help 2022-02-21 19:58:50 ?

help 2022-03-11 05:33:15 how fast are you going?
help 2022-03-11 05:33:43 thats why
help 2022-03-11 05:33:57 use motor 1 on lock
help 2022-03-11 05:34:04 its 90 degrees, just make a backboard
help 2022-03-11 05:34:07 thats why
help 2022-03-11 05:34:10 The motor 2
help 2022-03-11 05:34:12 Its unreliable
help 2022-03-11 05:34:35 just lock it
help 2022-03-11 05:34:36 And turn it
help 2022-03-11 05:34:46 so when you spawn
help 2022-03-11 05:34:48 Just rotate it
help 2022-03-11 05:34:58 It means that when landed you can choose the angle, for cosmetic purposes
help 2022-03-11 05:45:22 the motors only turn with YOUR input
help 2022-03-11 05:45:27 So things cannot push them
help 2022-03-11 05:45:41 Unless you stretch it from an anchor block it wont budge
help 2022-03-11 05:45:56 and wdym by up
help 2022-03-11 05:46:01 Like the plane's pitch?
help 2022-03-11 05:47:49 pitch
help 2022-03-11 05:47:54 yes
help 2022-03-11 05:47:58 Thats not really the wing
help 2022-03-11 05:48:04 well you are using mouse

help 2022-03-11 05:48:14 and **that** is a b17?
help 2022-03-11 05:48:31 its cause you are useing control panels with mouse input
help 2022-03-11 05:48:34 Keys are better
help 2022-03-11 05:48:58 just use editing
help 2022-03-11 05:49:00 Tip
help 2022-03-11 05:49:08 Dont dedicate to this plane too much
help 2022-03-11 05:51:38 np
help 2022-03-11 05:54:55 :)

help 2022-03-11 05:56:42 Dont stick to it
help 2022-03-11 05:56:50 Its better if you make a whole new plane

help 2022-03-11 05:56:59 constantly
help 2022-03-11 05:57:18 and straying from design

help 2022-03-11 05:58:00 Well
help 2022-03-11 05:58:07 How is the bomb made
help 2022-03-11 05:58:31 ok
help 2022-03-11 05:58:37 look into motorlocking
help 2022-03-11 05:58:48 you can make smaller but more potent bombs
help 2022-03-11 05:59:02 and put helium in the lock to lighted the weight of the bomb
help 2022-03-11 05:59:10 power
help 2022-03-11 05:59:40 potency is the power
help 2022-03-11 06:00:18 so a potent bomb is small for the same power
help 2022-03-11 06:00:34 by motorlocking
help 2022-03-11 06:00:40 it compresses explosive blocks
help 2022-03-11 06:00:41 Ok
help 2022-03-11 06:00:49 So you should look into it

help 2022-03-18 05:40:06 I think I made the simplest artillery function/parabola maker ever
help 2022-03-18 05:41:39 its unreliable in angling and weight balance

help 2022-03-18 05:41:46 You can see in the end what I mean
help 2022-03-18 05:42:40 its a seperation between tnt and suspension extension is ~30 ms, I know this cause im using a timing macro
help 2022-03-18 05:42:46 too early and no force
help 2022-03-18 05:42:50 too late and less force
help 2022-03-18 05:43:44 Add extra suspension and its a cannon more than artillery
help 2022-03-18 05:45:08 it is buggy tho
help 2022-03-18 05:47:13 Things now a stratospheric artillery if you add more suspension

the-dump 2022-03-18 21:22:55 Why does that gun have a colt carry handle, a scar reciever/iron sight, and no stock
the-dump 2022-03-18 21:23:02 And the barrel of a QB-15
the-dump 2022-03-18 21:23:14 Ik
the-dump 2022-03-18 21:23:22 The qbz looks different
the-dump 2022-03-18 21:23:33 Its built like one
the-dump 2022-03-18 21:23:47 And his hand is dangerously close to a place it shouldnt be if that's a qbz
the-dump 2022-03-18 21:24:00 The barrel on those has a reputation of blasting in places they shouldnt
the-dump 2022-03-18 21:24:03 Due to bad design
the-dump 2022-03-18 21:24:12 ohhhh it isnt colt
the-dump 2022-03-18 21:24:16 his tie is the same color as the gun
the-dump 2022-03-18 21:24:26 So I thought his suit tie made it look like a colt carry handle
the-dump 2022-03-18 21:25:17 Your argument has now been invalidated.
