creations-chat 2020-02-01 07:58:16 SU-47 Russian jet with some weird wing structure. Max speed 550 but does not start stalling until 180, allowing for nice glides across the map. The motorized flaps and rudders do turn off and on to allow for smoother control only using the control panels on the wings. 294 blocks, armed with 6 guns and 4 rockets.
