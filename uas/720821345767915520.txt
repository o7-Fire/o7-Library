creations-chat 2022-05-07 23:08:12 <@717378791759937636> do you have pontoons? i think pontoons could work for the tip of your side cart
creations-chat 2022-05-07 23:23:19 i dont know but it's what everyone do... ‚ô•Ô∏è
creations-chat 2022-05-07 23:31:20 i'm pretty sure hulk was looking for feedback, creative criticism and i can see that you're somewhat doing that, but is there really a need to call the build bad. it's like you're trying to help him and hurt him at the same time, just say what you think hulk needs to change in the build and leave it at that, no "overall turret design is poo fard"
