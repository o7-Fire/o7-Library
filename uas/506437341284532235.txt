creations-chat 2022-10-23 10:45:25 Propulsion transmission is the mode of transmitting and controlling propulsion power of a machine. The term transmission properly refers to the whole drivetrain, including clutch, gearbox, prop shaft (for rear-wheel drive vehicles), differential, and final drive shafts.
creations-chat 2022-10-24 12:20:03 the flywheel is useful because I have a non-instantaneous stop when the engine is turned off. The gearbox here is the simplest, it is produced when two engines are running, and when moving forward or backward, one of the engines turns on and off using a mechanical clutch. With the help of the clutch, all-wheel drive is also connected or idling is activated. And such huge engines end up experiencing a little shaking.
creations-chat 2022-10-24 12:22:48 2 giant rocket engines really so unnecessary bruh, I wasn't sure that the power of such engines would be enough, so I did this.<@642324788429324301>
creations-chat 2022-10-24 12:27:14 It have 1:1 gear ratio transmission, but right now I'm testing options with a different gear ratio, and so far nothing is working out for me.
creations-chat 2022-10-24 12:29:49 and during the connection/disconnection of the all-wheel drive, the engine must be disconnected, and therefore the flywheel is working
creations-chat 2022-10-24 17:24:59 THIS IS BEST PHANTOM
creations-chat 2022-11-30 18:15:58 yep
and with suspension and steering xd
creations-chat 2022-11-30 18:30:28 why downvotes(
creations-chat 2022-11-30 18:35:54 it's stupid to say it with a cage with wheels
creations-chat 2022-11-30 19:09:08 if you look closely, you will see a rather complex system in which there are a lot of gears, cardan shafts, mechanical couplings and rocket "engines"
