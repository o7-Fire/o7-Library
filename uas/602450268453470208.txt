creations-chat 2021-12-11 04:10:32 I built an Aircraft carrier like Somewhere in late 2020 or Early 2021... and its extremely fucking shit, The color, the haul, The island and the interior.

<@!540515443132334090>  BB, I was gonna rework my CV but I remembered I need to finish my Battleship
<@!757887014388367401> Probably making Iowa but I'll probably make so modifications fit for me

creations-chat 2021-12-11 05:27:12 I was using Both the low poly model and the first one you sent (Poly for the main stuff and the first thing you sent for the extremely detailed stuff
<@!720751430595772418> The Iowa kinda has a round thing but I see, I'll try to blend it in
creations-chat 2021-12-11 08:28:08 1/4 of I guess the Iowa, Any suggestions or stuff for me to fix? (Note: I am making a normal Plane Crazy BB, not Trash nor extremely fucking detailed using locked motors) and yes, I'll be taking color suggestions too
(I will be waiting for suggestions and feedback until 1 hour, Meanwhile I need to do a project)
<@!707953054489509978> WIP, I don't know how to make one <:trolled:899550609194233866>
creations-chat 2021-12-11 09:31:43 Thanks, but as I said I'm going to make it a normal Plane Crazy BB. Good detail and fits well but not extremely detailed like using motor locks, I'll do it once I become an very skilled expert at the game.
creations-chat 2021-12-11 11:21:00 lmao yeah, It does look better with that
