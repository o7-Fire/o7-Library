help 2020-08-17 12:45:01 I have made battleship artillery with motors 2, i set it on toggle and it was working great. But suddenly (I didn't do any changes to the artillery) I can't toggle them, as I spawn my ship they move a little, return to their position and then when I try to toggle them it doesn't work, help pls
help 2020-08-17 12:49:50 My motors don't want to move although they are not blocked by anything, they don't respond to me pressing buttons
help 2020-08-17 18:15:28 How to make my ship stop flipping on the sides?
help 2020-08-17 18:15:42 huh
help 2020-08-17 18:15:48 that is actually a great idea thanks
creations-chat 2020-11-25 09:55:45 Guys, when I launch a missile off my battleship it flies a couple of blocks and suddenly freezes, I can turn on the engine but it won't move anywhere. It's just levitating there, anyone has any idea why it does that?

help 2020-11-25 10:33:01 Yeah everything is unanchored
bug-reports 2021-03-20 13:24:52 thanks planecrazy
bug-reports 2021-03-20 13:25:02 
bug-reports 2021-03-20 13:25:24 I have anchor blocks on my submarine, and it starts flinging even before I can fold it (it happens sometimes, not all the time but really often)
bug-reports 2021-03-20 13:29:07 
bug-reports 2021-03-20 13:29:17 I meant that it's flinging even if I have anchor on, the motors probably screw everything up
bug-reports 2021-03-20 13:29:29 Because it breaks only in the motor places
bug-reports 2021-03-20 13:29:41 lol
bug-reports 2021-03-20 13:29:41 in conclusion, fix motors pls
bug-reports 2021-03-20 13:56:13 Oh
bug-reports 2021-03-20 13:56:20 Okay thanks for the tip I'll try that
bug-reports 2021-03-20 13:56:31 Thanks mate
bug-reports 2021-03-20 14:04:02 Nope it's even worse
bug-reports 2021-03-20 14:04:19 it lags and when I try to fold it, it folds a bit and then unfolds again
bug-reports 2021-03-20 14:05:36 Yes
bug-reports 2021-03-20 14:05:45 I selected lock and it's even worse
bug-reports 2021-03-20 14:06:25 I mean, it folds
bug-reports 2021-03-20 14:06:28 but when I try to open silos
bug-reports 2021-03-20 14:06:35 they open like 45 degrees
bug-reports 2021-03-20 14:06:38 and slam shut again
