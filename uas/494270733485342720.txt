bug-reports 2021-08-26 17:36:54 For some bloody reason I can't use any engines, anything in the engines tab does not work for me, rockets, propellers, none of it will work, I can't figure out why
bug-reports 2021-08-26 18:33:43 yes other blocks work, I can get a heli to work if I only use motors
bug-reports 2021-08-26 18:33:54 I haven't checked much other stuff
bug-reports 2021-08-26 18:34:21 but weapons work
bug-reports 2021-08-26 18:34:33 its just rockets propellers and the like refusing commands
events-chat 2022-01-09 01:52:15 so torpedoes are limited to 1x1 studs?
events-chat 2022-01-09 01:52:31 why?
events-chat 2022-01-09 01:52:51 you can easily make it guided
events-chat 2022-01-09 01:53:52 is there a reason why the devs don't make a larger map?
events-chat 2022-01-09 01:54:56 it would be insanely easy to make a quick update
events-chat 2022-01-09 01:55:16 giving us a decent ammount of water so we can have actual sub v sub duels
events-chat 2022-01-09 01:56:11 it's roblox, how hard is it to expand the map?
events-chat 2022-01-09 02:05:53 just waiting to see some of the ship designs people come up with
events-chat 2022-01-09 02:09:11 why no subs?
events-chat 2022-01-09 02:11:09 gun subs are maximum cringe
events-chat 2022-01-09 02:11:26 but they are vulnerable to a literal block of glass
events-chat 2022-01-09 18:34:36 damn the last few boats look awesome
events-chat 2022-01-09 19:20:36 can we put disconnectors around torpedoes for aesthetic reasons
