creations-chat 2019-09-14 06:06:33 enderman witch a couple of blocks, he has magnets on his arms so he can grab the blocks and he has pistons attached to the down part of his mouth and the up part so he can open his mouth, and he can move, i put a couple of helium blocks in him so he can actually stand up and not fall over and i use propellers to move him
