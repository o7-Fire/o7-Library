creations-chat 2019-02-05 01:35:31 yyyOoosoOosSSsSS

creations-chat 2019-02-05 21:00:55 
creations-chat 2019-02-05 21:01:05 it might be a bit smaller than real scale but I think it's fine
creations-chat 2019-02-05 21:01:40 one issue im getting is just keeping the motors from glitching a ton
creations-chat 2019-02-05 21:01:47 right now the wings are anchored so idk
creations-chat 2019-02-05 21:02:04 im just gonna start the hardest part from this point, the tai
creations-chat 2019-02-05 21:02:05 tail*
creations-chat 2019-02-05 21:02:21 only the left wing
creations-chat 2019-02-05 21:02:26 facing the planes direction
creations-chat 2019-02-05 21:02:43 on the second picture, the wing all the way to the righ
creations-chat 2019-02-05 21:02:49 its because there are more motors
creations-chat 2019-02-05 21:02:53 because it has to fold more to fit
creations-chat 2019-02-05 21:03:18 this is my current situation
creations-chat 2019-02-05 21:04:24 i might just barely have enough space
creations-chat 2019-02-05 21:04:29 i can make the tail fold a lot to fit also
creations-chat 2019-02-05 21:04:37 so
creations-chat 2019-02-05 21:04:37 but thats just more lag
creations-chat 2019-02-05 21:05:00 im at 2291 blocks right now, this will be my largest build if the tail is more than 400 blocks
creations-chat 2019-02-05 21:08:45 oh god i just realied
creations-chat 2019-02-05 21:08:47 realized
creations-chat 2019-02-05 21:09:00 theres no way i can fit the horizontal stabilizer and the rudders
creations-chat 2019-02-05 21:09:10 because it's the weird configuration like a B24
creations-chat 2019-02-05 21:09:47 ]
creations-chat 2019-02-05 21:17:50 good news; the wings are unanchored and are not glitching like hell
creations-chat 2019-02-05 21:18:28 bad news; theres literally no way i can build the tail long enough
creations-chat 2019-02-05 21:18:51 i have to build something longer than the nose currently is in a tiny space
creations-chat 2019-02-05 21:18:56 sooo..

help 2019-02-09 13:51:38 i learned this technique from a friend
help 2019-02-09 13:51:44 it's really useful
help 2019-02-09 13:53:52 so you have these two bits, they can be any size
help 2019-02-09 13:54:55 just gonna have to delete a few blocks and place motors
help 2019-02-09 13:55:09 
help 2019-02-09 13:55:29 you can do this reversed so it fist
help 2019-02-09 13:55:31 fits*
help 2019-02-09 13:55:51 i usually do this with the top of the fuselage three blocks
help 2019-02-09 13:56:00 but to make it looks better you can just add motors to both sides
help 2019-02-09 13:56:05 god i cant type
help 2019-02-09 13:56:26 
help 2019-02-09 13:57:49 you will have to switch the motor keybinds
help 2019-02-09 13:57:57 but when it folds it looks like that
help 2019-02-09 13:58:00 then you just extend the bits
help 2019-02-09 13:58:41 i was actually wrong when i deleted those two blocks
help 2019-02-09 13:58:46 you cna fill them with wedges

Clicking it or any things i could have modified does nothing, spawning and coming back does nothing
only rejoining works which is annoying
creations-chat 2019-02-10 11:59:12 im making a corsair, might add an airfoil at some point to the wings
creations-chat 2019-02-10 11:59:25 and when its painted itll look better
creations-chat 2019-02-10 12:05:33

creations-chat 2019-02-10 12:22:35 oh
creations-chat 2019-02-10 12:23:07 well i am not copying if you are trying to say that
creations-chat 2019-02-10 12:23:25 we're probably just building to a similar scale
creations-chat 2019-02-10 12:23:33 and that would make them look similar
creations-chat 2019-02-10 12:23:59 im using the pretty typical half blocks and half wedges with a 3x3 space inside
creations-chat 2019-02-10 12:24:07 like for the engine
creations-chat 2019-02-10 16:06:53 this project is nowhere near done but here;
Vought F4U Corsair
Currently it's running at a max of about 350 or maybe a bit more from only the prop. I'm gonna have to add some trim or something to keep it stable, but it flies. Landing gear may be a pain :/
creations-chat 2019-02-10 16:09:35 rip
creations-chat 2019-02-10 19:52:39 i think its done, might refine it a bit more though

bug-reports 2019-02-12 11:39:49 My normal landing gear are randomly retracting

Has the fully functioning turret, functioning front-mounted machine gun, and I think it looks really good as my first real tank (besides a T-34 I tried making, not that good)

Doesn't use real tracks because I'm not that advanced yet

Overall my first good tank!

help 2020-02-20 21:32:18 https://streamable.com/wlmu1 how can i fix this piston bouncing? if i cant, is there an alternative way to get a rigid half-block extension from something?
help 2020-02-20 21:35:20 it doesnt help that i cant use much space due to suspension
help 2020-02-20 21:35:42 i might try doing a rope+suspension thing
help 2020-02-20 21:35:52 but i am not sure how rigid it will be
help 2020-02-20 21:38:17 nevermind, a single suspension piece set to max stiffness should hopefully do the trick
help 2020-02-20 21:54:46 alrighty
help 2020-02-20 22:14:09 ok this thing is not working at all anymore
help 2020-02-20 22:15:47 i think im gonna have to just compromise how the tank looks to make it actually work
help 2020-02-20 22:17:23 i need to lower the turret down by a half block
help 2020-02-20 22:17:32 to make it flush with the body
help 2020-02-20 22:17:37 thats smart
help 2020-02-20 22:17:40 hm
help 2020-02-20 22:19:47 i tried suspension
help 2020-02-20 22:19:56 the bouncing makes it glitch out uncontrollably
help 2020-02-20 22:20:54 ok
help 2020-02-20 22:20:56 the only issue is
help 2020-02-20 22:21:08 having the locked motor on my tank makes all the pistons on it break
help 2020-02-20 22:21:43 
help 2020-02-20 22:21:57 those were not supposed to be extended without pressing any buttons
help 2020-02-20 22:23:41 hold on im confused
help 2020-02-20 22:23:48 there is no suspension for the turret thing
help 2020-02-20 22:23:51 only for the wheels
help 2020-02-20 22:23:56 and i did not place the pistons wrong
help 2020-02-20 22:24:02 they were working fine earlier
help 2020-02-20 22:24:15 yes
help 2020-02-20 22:24:18 i told you before though
help 2020-02-20 22:24:25 the suspension starts bouncing
help 2020-02-20 22:24:29 and then the turret flies out
help 2020-02-20 22:24:33 i already tried using suspension

help 2020-02-20 22:25:44 thats what i was doing
help 2020-02-20 22:25:48 and never got a working result
help 2020-02-20 22:25:55 because of the bouncing
help 2020-02-20 22:26:01 i think im just gonna have to compromise
help 2020-02-20 22:26:42 there were only pistons extending a piece on the front
help 2020-02-20 22:26:45 not for the turret
help 2020-02-20 22:27:10 in the streamabl e i sent
help 2020-02-20 22:27:16 it was using suspension

creations-chat 2020-12-22 01:08:06 thats one of the simplest types of engines to make, just directly connecting the crankshaft to camshaft
i designed this weird magnet steam engine kind of thing a while back
creations-chat 2020-12-22 01:10:06 timing belts can slip easily, i would recommend using a motor linkage if you are going to make anything
motor linkages have zero slip and very little friction
any form of slippage would ruin the engines performance

creations-chat 2021-03-04 19:28:02 so you are suggesting that someone with 100days playtime shouldnt be expected to make half-decent builds
that seems extremely counter-intuitive
creations-chat 2021-03-04 19:30:04 if thats what you think 👍

<@!323928094132011008> okay but isnt part of having fun being able to create builds that you are proud of and can show off to others, rather than being contempt with lower-quality builds?
of course i know this is roblox, but the point that im getting at is that its difficult to enjoy a game when your skills dont progress

btw 2 block wide wings are roughly 2 meters depending on how you convert
creations-chat 2021-04-24 00:15:06 you are expecting me to believe this
creations-chat 2021-04-24 00:17:29 i can offer some feedback:
i feel like if you add more delta wings and extend the curve of the wing, the top profile of the wing will look much better
maybe either use motor angled wings or something else
creations-chat 2021-04-24 00:21:31 also hes trying to say that he used real measurements given to him by his grandfather who guarded an sr-71 when it was in service <:WhatChamp:775044367022555166>

creations-chat 2022-05-23 19:13:43 you can change the rpm vs torque output
larger stroke = more torque less rpm
smaller stroke = more rpm less torque
its like having a 2 speed gearbox
in a real engine being able to change the amount of compression is also useful for fuel economy
creations-chat 2022-05-23 19:16:51 changing the timing wont let you increase rpm above a certain point
being able to reduce the piston stroke expands the efficient operating range of the engine
