creations-chat 2022-03-31 03:53:08 I recommend you motor lock the nose to make it smoother
creations-chat 2022-03-31 04:15:41 you need a chat rank of 3
creations-chat 2022-03-31 04:20:44 same, only reason why I'm talking
creations-chat 2022-03-31 04:24:27 alongside what 9_sf said the smoothness doesn't go with the chunky nature of the build
creations-chat 2022-03-31 04:29:20 it looks kinda fine now. I think you could figure it out more as you're building but I'm no pro :P
creations-chat 2022-03-31 04:32:37 I was gonna WIP a mig 29 in the next hour thanks for the tip <:clueless:942802644043464734>

creations-chat 2022-03-31 05:17:40 ikr not everything has to be perfect to the block
creations-chat 2022-03-31 05:20:56 ok, so I looked at what you built and it... yeah it doesn't hold up to the pcc standards. it's a cool build but it needs some work on the dimentions imo. don't take it as offense I'm just giving some critisism ;)
creations-chat 2022-03-31 05:26:38 they're like two little cancer tumors people rarely make those look good

creations-chat 2022-03-31 06:29:59 just want to note how this chat always casually goes to shit once nobody posts creations after a while <:pain:644301805534183464>
creations-chat 2022-03-31 06:34:46 I mean people have stuff like gender dysphoria and like actually hate themselves. I don't think that wanting a new identity is that bad

creations-chat 2022-04-05 03:18:00 ok I see what your getting at, if you did actually make it human scale then thats cool but we're building in a doodoo lego game for 5 year olds not everything has to be realistic. going outside the proportionality boundries and adding some fine details and such would add to the build
creations-chat 2022-04-05 03:22:42 and like the more life like cockpit openings. nobody does it because it's a waste of time bc it doesn't do anything. adding detail to the cockpit and changing it's design would make it visually appealing. look at the community. nothing is unusual because they know how to build off of the back of their hand and people like it. take inspiration from them and incorporate their style into your builds
creations-chat 2022-04-05 03:38:34 ok so to ellaborate on why I am not writing paragraph should only take a second. so first of all I am giving constructive precise critisism. I have the legal right of the first ammendment given in the united states to freely speak out an express myself throught text. the text may  look unreasonably long yet you have not taken the time to read it. as for reason as of why I have not put a tl;dr in my paragraph is because it examplifies that people would rather look at an inacurate representation of the text rather than read it single handedly. the build in question was amalgamated by a wrather inexperienced builder (not stating thst I'm one of the expericenced themselves) and they could read this as a source of information to help them improve and adapt their building technique to acquire a higher skillset and allow oneself to forsee their future as a builder in said community. insulting my critisism is uncanny of a person to do as it makes the builder in question more stubborn and likely to make another shit creation. thank you for reading my speech.
creations-chat 2022-04-05 03:40:36 no
creations-chat 2022-04-05 03:46:21 planet making did, it's constructive critisism with serious though put into it, I have the legal right to say what I shall without major restrictions as restated by the U.S. government and their legal system. unless you aren't from america I entrust that you have the moral code to respect my ethnicity and culture. this is also I believe stated in the global human rights.

edit: as a retort to <@287454032250011649> flawed rebuttle
creations-chat 2022-04-05 03:59:25 ok so I have a retort to that. In world war two there were many catostrophic events as you may know. the build that the poster has created was based of a colombian P-51 model. during the devastating war, people had their humanity stripped from them. the bad bad germans were huge contributors to such a cause, as they murdered innocent people in the mass. we cant forget about the normal civillians. in brittian their homes were bombed and their work, schools, and a surplus amount of other things were stripped away from them because of the war. in japan (where a copious supply of P-51s were used) they put people in labor camps where they put those who weren't up to their likings in them and abused their rights. I could go on and on about how human rights in this argumentative battle is necessary and relevant because if you dig deeper into the meaning of the origional plane it was used during a battle where plenty have suffered. I am no history teacher but I am studying to be so and my grandma used to be one. in conclusion, don't dis me because of my long lines of text. they're equally as reasonable responses as short sentences just far more descriptive
creations-chat 2022-04-05 04:01:26 are you guys still following or am I just rambling?
