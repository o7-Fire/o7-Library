bug-reports 2019-08-17 06:13:45 when motors have a lot of mass attached to them, if you let go of the forward/backward button it stops rotating abruptly and then the motor starts freaking out. i recommend making a checkbox that allows them to speed up or slow down gradually
bug-reports 2019-08-17 06:14:25 when it freaks out the motor rotates and jitters randomly and makes the whole creative have a seizure.

bug-reports 2020-05-29 14:35:23 Huge jet engine isn't nearly powerful enough for its weight, can't even lift itself off the ground. Been like that as long as I can remember. Will anything be done about that?
bug-reports 2021-01-07 05:21:17 Heavy creations will sometimes bounce around when there are only a few points of contact with the ground (i.e. a large plane with 3 landing gear)
bug-reports 2021-01-07 05:24:09 Especially if they have moving parts (folds in my case)
bug-reports 2021-01-07 05:30:15 Upon further testing I think the wheels of the landing gear were causing it, but it's still a bug
