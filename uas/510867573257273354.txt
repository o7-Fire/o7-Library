bot-central 2019-05-10 19:44:57 &suggest block editor tool
bug-reports 2019-05-12 14:18:11 if i respawn my creation, i can't do anything like place or drive with it. than i have to reload it until i can do something
bug-reports 2019-05-12 14:20:23 if i or somebody else spawns their big creation like a warship or my tu-160 blackjack, than the server will lag, it makes it impossible to see the map or where you're flying
bug-reports 2019-05-12 18:16:50 mine are in the normal server
bug-reports 2019-05-25 15:02:01 fix this motor glitch: if i want to unfold my creation, only one direction works, only key O works and key P doesn't work
bug-reports 2019-05-25 15:05:11 the motors works 100 % when motor option 'Lock' has turned off, so i think 'Lock' is the problem of this glitch/bug/issue
creations-chat 2019-05-25 15:15:21 Lockheed SR-71 (Blackbird, The Thing, Habu) with 1252 blocks, with fold system, parachute, 100% working landing gears (also with an hatch), cockpit hatch and thats it.

creations-chat 2019-05-25 18:00:46 the attack helicopter Orca Fighter of the game Command & Conquer Tiberian Sun (Firestorm expension). It can reach the 600 mph, has a machine gun at the front, if it crashes in the sea, it can transform its self  to a boat/hovercraft. But its difficult to control it; it can dive suddenly when a rocket engine is failing, which make the helicopter stable, but it flies
creations-chat 2019-05-25 18:01:14 Here it's transformed to a hovercraft/boat
bug-reports 2019-05-25 18:19:16 <@416254104017305600>  it works, but the pistons, which opens the hatch of the landing gears of my Concordski, won't working
bug-reports 2019-05-25 18:20:01 <@416254104017305600>  nvm
bug-reports 2019-05-29 16:08:15 sometimes after i respawn my creation, the buttons won't work anymore, only the Tutorial, Gamemodes, Save/Load, Settings, Jetpack, Ragdoll and Parachute buttons works.
bug-reports 2019-05-29 16:10:19 good luck with developing and fixing by the way
bug-reports 2019-06-05 18:45:30 the motors and pistons glitches very well when spawned and folded my plane........

bug-reports 2019-07-12 19:18:53 yes thats this one

bug-reports 2019-07-15 10:27:29 the motors glitched (it hasn't motor option lock)
bug-reports 2019-07-15 11:10:41 this is the oldest glitch i know, when engines are turned on or taking power, you will hear this
bug-reports 2019-07-15 11:11:31 and i mean ALL engines

bug-reports 2019-08-21 11:36:45 does not work
bug-reports 2019-08-21 12:05:54 something is wrong with the propeller engines, they aren't working when I'm flying with my plane. they are critical because they avoid the plane with banking dangerous. but it doesn't, they are causing the plane with banking, which results in a crash or dive
bug-reports 2019-08-21 12:55:22 Idk how to call it, but this is what i mean
bug-reports 2019-08-21 12:56:19 yes im poor at speaking/writting english
bug-reports 2019-08-21 14:54:52 oof nvm lol. 1 propeller engine weren't working; On/Off mode was turned off, and it had controls W and S. problem solved

bug-reports 2019-08-25 15:29:17 oh oof
bug-reports 2019-08-29 06:11:49 first, the turret rotates to the left, and then it rotates a bit to the right. it works also the opposite: when the turret rotates to the right, it will rotate a bit to the left. It's maybe hard to understand, but when you watch the movie, then you'll maybe understand what I mean (motors are still bugging, even without motor setting lock)
bug-reports 2019-08-29 06:11:57 it's a leopard 2 btw
bug-reports 2019-08-29 07:56:13 and when this happends, all motors and engines will bug

bug-reports 2019-09-08 12:53:29 im flying below the 90 knots/mph and its still bugging. i really dont think its going too fast because before the latest update, i dropped it with almost 300 knots/mph

bug-reports 2019-09-28 09:21:43 my F-22 has the same bug like my F-15. when i activate a motor, the entire plane falls out of the sky. and than nothing works anymore, this happens everytime when i spawn it, like my F-15
bug-reports 2019-10-20 18:18:15 my friend has a glitching/bugging Maus (WW2 german tank).  we know what causes this: suspension, the suspension is connected with 2 (normal) motors. maybe this mix of suspension and 2 motors causes this glitch
bug-reports 2019-10-20 18:20:22 yes
bug-reports 2019-10-22 19:13:01 motors have been passed out? well this landing gear of my friend is using motor 1, and its going slower than the requested speed 1, and its resetting itself while Reset has been turned off, than it stops completely with working, this happens also with the motor 2. Motor 2 broken counter 77(?)
bug-reports 2019-10-22 19:16:54 lol
bug-reports 2019-10-22 19:16:57 he just made a mistake
bug-reports 2019-10-22 19:17:11 MOTOR 2 BROKEN COUNTER 76*
bug-reports 2019-11-03 14:04:34 i've never seen this before, my Me-262 glitches immediatly after spawning, probably motor 2 is causing it, but it uses a lot of motor 1's so that could be the cause too. i'll try to remove at first all motor 2's and than if its still glitching, removing all motor 1's
bug-reports 2019-11-03 14:06:08 problem is motor 2
bug-reports 2019-11-03 14:06:24 oof
bug-reports 2019-11-03 14:09:41 i conclude that if i place more than 5 motor 2's on my Me-262, it will glitch, if i place 5 motor 2's or less, than it doesn't glitch
bug-reports 2019-11-03 16:18:40 <@!435946988559925248> servo is on

bug-reports 2019-12-05 19:32:29 it happens already a few months, it took me 10 or 20 seconds until it disappeared. But lately, it took me a minute, every quarter-hour. So it happens I think 5 - 10 times per day. I can't click on the buttons of the left side of my screen, only the right side works. So the only thing I can try to do is reloading the build to let this bug disappear. It's just a waste of time.
bug-reports 2019-12-05 19:32:44 something have increased the time of this bug

bug-reports 2019-12-06 21:33:03 this happend WHILE IT'S ANCHORED (+option physics). very insane
bug-reports 2019-12-06 21:34:15 looks like its getting worse
bug-reports 2019-12-06 21:35:29 the anchor-option physics caused this
bug-reports 2019-12-06 21:37:02 when Physics is turned off, its not bugging until i unanchor it
bug-reports 2019-12-06 21:37:16 even when i wait 20 seconds it getting bugged and flinged
bug-reports 2019-12-06 21:38:46 it's also getting flinged when i wait 1 minute
bug-reports 2019-12-06 21:38:54 motor 2's are totally bugged
bug-reports 2019-12-06 21:39:40 looks like the amount of motor 2's caused this
bug-reports 2019-12-06 21:40:06 i've just deleted 2 motor 2's and the bug is getting decreased, but they are still bugging and glitching
bug-reports 2019-12-10 16:06:23 the anchor option Physics has been totally bugged, it doesn't anchor the plane with the known motor 2 bug/glitch. btw whats the speed record cuz i hit the 80 million sps i guess
bug-reports 2019-12-10 16:08:20 this bug could appear by a mix of the anchor option Physics and motor 2 with mouse control
bug-reports 2019-12-10 16:13:40 thx for info

bug-reports 2019-12-24 15:28:43 jesus
bug-reports 2019-12-24 15:29:34 this happend short after i got the bug where the left side of my screen is not working
bug-reports 2019-12-24 15:30:06 and this glitch happend 3 times short before that bug
bug-reports 2019-12-24 15:32:07 you can solve this bug and let it disappear by spawning and respawning your creation
bug-reports 2019-12-24 21:14:45 i am not be able to report a guy called WorldsBestChampion09 (because of nsfw) in <#623337136267067393> while it only has 1 link (i was not be able to search his profile or roblox will say ''cannot find #######'')
bug-reports 2019-12-24 21:14:57 is this because of somebody else reported him already?
bug-reports 2019-12-25 10:30:40 looks like the motors are resetting them selves while Reset is turned off. those folds are containing only motor 1's. this is the first time i am seeing this glitch/bug in my whole life, and then i am getting kicked from the private server of my friend hmhmhmhmhmmhm
bug-reports 2019-12-25 10:32:16 i am getting kicked everywhere
bug-reports 2019-12-25 10:32:30 and i am trying to make a showcase for a viewer
bug-reports 2019-12-25 10:33:11 (why does this happen with literally my biggest plane i ever have which took me 7 hours to build)
bug-reports 2019-12-25 10:37:16 it happens with almost everything i got
bug-reports 2019-12-25 10:38:43 even the small ones
bug-reports 2019-12-25 10:39:09 all my creations i made for my viewers are failed because of this bug
bug-reports 2019-12-25 10:40:47 even with my M-18
bug-reports 2019-12-25 10:41:56 i gtg, when im back i'll try to spawn my small and big creations on my alts or i have to stop with my youtube channel
bug-reports 2019-12-26 11:20:40 
bug-reports 2019-12-26 11:20:40 i know this is not a glitch or bug or whatever but its annoying. those places are having a small area which is much higher than the bases and surroundings. everybody who has a base straight behind that area and are testing their new aircraft are colliding with this and those area's are high enough to stop aircraft for a while and it will crash
bug-reports 2019-12-26 11:23:41 idk how to call those area's
bug-reports 2019-12-26 11:33:40 ik, but i wouldn't call it high terrain lol
bug-reports 2020-01-08 19:31:31 last month, from 7 december to 7 january, i was counting how much times my building-tools were frozen. this bug will freeze all the buttons and tools on the left side of my screen. i've counted  115 bugs, with a record of 24 times on 1 day. last half hour it happend 3 times. 4 times, this bug led to the bug where you'll get everything in the building menu twice or more. so maybe, the bug where the left side is frozen, could lead to twice or more blocks in the building menu. i lost 115 minutes, almost 2 hours because of this bug
bug-reports 2020-01-10 15:56:49 the bug which i have, the bug where the building menu and the other tools on the left side of my screen got frozen, happens everywhere, in all empty private servers, full and almost-empty servers, even when a full server spawns their smallest and biggest creation. it occurs with every creation i got, small and huge. last hour it happend already 7 times, and 1 single bug takes me 1 minute untill it dissappears (which means i lost 7 minutes, but last month i lost 115 minutes almost 2 hours)
bug-reports 2020-01-10 15:57:08 this is pretty game breaking
bug-reports 2020-01-10 15:58:57 impossible, i got a gamingpc with 5G

bug-reports 2020-01-11 20:11:47 all motors, pistons and other movable things are not working when building is anchored, because to decrease glitches, bugs and lag?
bug-reports 2020-01-11 20:44:56 well uh it wasnt supposed as a bug report but its weird to me, and its getting complicated because when its anchored, a motor is moving at my test thingy
bug-reports 2020-01-11 20:45:30 btw my friend has a bug where he has no plot, and is not be able to build anything. he is getting this bug every day, and rejoining is not helping
bug-reports 2020-01-11 20:45:45 this counts as a very game breaking bug?
bug-reports 2020-01-11 20:46:05 looks like he is the only one who has this bug

bug-reports 2020-02-18 11:15:15 ice doesn't work i said
bug-reports 2020-02-18 11:15:44 i guess its the in-game or roblox physics

Was meant to be an emergency solution during the development of the AH-56 Cheyenne during the Vietnam war.
