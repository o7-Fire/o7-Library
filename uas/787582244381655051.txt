creations-chat 2022-08-31 00:09:46 Well, if your tryna be that arrogant and judgemental. Then show ur best build, and let the community decide if your  judgementality matches up with that building of yours
creations-chat 2022-08-31 00:12:21 Bro expects a a thread that can move which are already hard with doing a normal sized tracks.

creations-chat 2022-08-31 00:24:04 Then what the hell was the explanation earlier? You rlly think u can make a roscale with a working tracks? Making a normal tracks is already hard? You think its easy ?
creations-chat 2022-08-31 00:31:40 +the game breaks physics and merges together

Does it fly yet
creations-chat 2022-09-08 15:06:26 <@706717603258957864> can u gimme a background explanation on what is happening?
creations-chat 2022-09-08 15:08:51 Lol 

<@918581321004089364> what was your way of hiding that motorlock gap?
creations-chat 2022-09-08 15:13:17 What? What was the correlation between the propellers and the argument?
creations-chat 2022-09-08 15:17:16 No he isnt talking about his plane, he is talking about the way to cover your motorlock. A little exposing of a motorlock can have significant amount of opinions  and judgement on your build.
creations-chat 2022-09-08 15:21:11 Tbh i rather not hide it cuz like i very impatient and wanna test try it as soon as possible and really just wanna feel the enjoyment of finishing a project and not worrying about intense details such as the exposed motorlock, like this exposed motorlock abomination. But now that i think about it. I hid most of the motorlock on the outer shell of the tank. Hm
creations-chat 2022-09-08 15:25:28 Can you show what it looks like?
creations-chat 2022-09-08 15:48:08 Tbh the pc discord isnt the place to argue. Twitter is the place to argue. Or should i say is the argument all along
