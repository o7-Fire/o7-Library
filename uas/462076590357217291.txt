help 2021-08-20 00:43:10 that would be more pressure since its folding down right

help 2021-08-20 00:44:51 if i make it lighter by taking away detail everyone says my build is to blocky and trash
help 2021-08-20 00:45:31 speed is to fast for the control panels i think
help 2021-08-20 00:45:55 bigger planes can handle faster speeds, little planes cannot, i think its the wingspan
help 2021-08-20 00:46:09 im gonna create a stronger motor somehow
help 2021-08-20 00:49:46 would higher torque fix a weak motor?
help 2021-08-20 01:08:38 this might be the cause, the block under is the pistion
help 2021-08-20 01:09:53 learn how to fold thats one thing i did wrong lmao
help 2021-08-20 01:10:43 just make it big and make sure to not make it blocky like i originally did and also make sure the weight is balanced out because i didnt do that and i needed ballast and rockets to keep me flying
