creations-chat 2020-06-28 21:08:23 like, the wings and stuff
creations-chat 2020-06-28 21:08:46 also, you should use custom props using motors and prop blades/wing apnels
creations-chat 2020-06-28 21:09:36 not really talking to you
bug-reports 2020-06-30 12:18:09 uh, rick, when your broke the blacklist by having an invisible one, you also broke the actual blacklist, by making it useless
bug-reports 2020-06-30 12:18:37 dont mind the bars around the vid btw, thats just my crappy graphics driver
bug-reports 2020-06-30 12:21:52 also, make PVP serversided, cuz when you hit someone, 90% of the time it doesnt actually register as a hit to them
bug-reports 2020-06-30 12:22:09 sometimes the build just freezes
bug-reports 2020-06-30 12:22:54 and they become just a tiny part flying around, and the rest is invisible, which ruins PVP experience

bug-reports 2020-07-02 12:57:14 most of the causes are because it is client sided

bug-reports 2020-07-04 11:43:17 1. see if its anchored. sometimes that stops a motor from turning.
2. there might be a part welding somewhere
3. sometimes hitboxes weld, so check your wedges/half blocks too
bug-reports 2020-07-06 11:41:04 do you have cameras on your build?
bug-reports 2020-07-06 11:41:19 or pistons or suspensions?
bug-reports 2020-07-07 18:37:09 is it pvp?
bug-reports 2020-07-07 18:37:20 if so, thats just because its clientsided

bug-reports 2021-01-02 21:25:04 usually happens with lag
bug-reports 2021-01-02 21:25:44 if you drop below around 25 fps physics start to dissolve

bug-reports 2021-01-11 21:03:36 yeah just like in real life if you were to put glue on a flat surface, and try to attach it to the tip of the wedge, it wouldn't stick
bug-reports 2021-01-11 21:05:09 because there is no face parallel to the flat surface

bug-reports 2021-02-18 14:27:06 its not that hard
bug-reports 2021-02-18 15:10:02 you literally just need to make a stick of explosives
bug-reports 2021-02-18 16:19:08 ok then stick an engine on the back and some in front to steer

bug-reports 2021-05-14 02:12:45 i use hover thrusters as the main source of thrust on a lot of my jets, and Ive never had that problem with it
bug-reports 2021-06-30 13:44:38 I mostly get it when anyone joins/leaves the server
creations-chat 2022-02-21 15:12:22 so far, does this resemble a forrestal class carrier?
creations-chat 2022-02-21 18:27:19 better?
creations-chat 2022-02-21 18:44:35 better now? also ik the landing zone is misaligned
bug-reports 2022-03-07 23:25:33 vip servers will keep teleporting you to the waiting place after a few minutes
bug-reports 2022-03-07 23:25:50 doesnt matter that they are already updated
bug-reports 2022-03-07 23:25:57 they will always kick you out
bug-reports 2022-03-07 23:29:57 also sometimes you get teleported to an un-updated server
bug-reports 2022-03-07 23:44:35 waited in one public server for 10 min after being teleported there and it has not updated yet
bug-reports 2022-03-07 23:45:23 in the meantime my alt has been teleported after just a few minutes on an already updated private server

creations-chat 2022-05-23 03:22:35 which of these wing vapors looks better?
creations-chat 2022-05-23 03:42:40 how does this one look as well
creations-chat 2022-05-23 03:51:40 its sad that wing panels have too much drag to let you pull a lot of alpha
creations-chat 2022-05-23 04:07:18 custom flaps, too lazy to fill in the edges just yet
creations-chat 2022-05-23 04:09:33 tried them when I first built it but they just didn't give it the same agility as custom
creations-chat 2022-05-23 04:12:19 I could just fill it in with trails

help 2022-07-16 03:40:36 but I shed like 30fps and start stuttering

bug-reports 2022-08-01 16:26:50 if you save a sign with "Status: Boarding" on it and then load it again it deletes ": Boarding"
bug-reports 2022-08-01 16:27:38 doesnt just happen with that phrase
bug-reports 2022-08-01 16:28:06 lots of sign things have started vanishing when saving
bug-reports 2022-08-01 16:30:12 it looks like the sign is unable to save the : and anything after it
bug-reports 2022-08-01 16:30:52 using a ; just makes the sign revert to default text
bug-reports 2022-08-01 16:33:22 using : or ; could also make the text size tiny when loading again
bug-reports 2022-08-01 16:34:13 nothing in logs

help 2022-08-27 21:43:10 is there an easy way to make this outer grey square able to slide up and down the inner white square
help 2022-08-27 21:43:43 when its locked in like this the outer square clips the inner one for some reason and that pretty much renders it useless
help 2022-08-27 21:49:38 this is what the inner one is (1 square=1 block)
help 2022-08-28 14:07:08 is there a way to have a disconnector touching the top of a half block without it clipping into the half block?
help 2022-08-28 14:07:58 it always does this when locked which is what im trying to avoid
help 2022-08-28 14:15:43 the clipping
help 2022-08-28 14:16:02 you can see on both parts the disconnector is inside of the half block
