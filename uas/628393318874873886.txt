plane-crazy 2020-07-26 18:40:31 lol
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 18:38:16 why did you try a ping lol
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 22:35:42 but higher than urs in the category
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 22:35:30 one role
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 22:34:46 use disconnectors to make space
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 22:34:29 then make room
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 22:34:00 and the design is a bit klunky
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 22:33:50 it has kind of bad landing gear
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 22:33:10 <@!523278765825196062>
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 22:33:02 because its not that good
plane-crazy 2020-07-16 15:47:49 so?
plane-crazy 2020-07-16 15:43:15 happy bday plane crazy ðŸ¥³
plane-crazy 2020-07-14 15:43:56 this is like the understatement of the century
plane-crazy 2020-07-14 15:43:42 
plane-crazy 2020-06-26 21:41:44 i literally fell down a stair block...
plane-crazy 2020-06-24 02:22:22 in plane crazy we have something to fight, even in non PVP:

W E D G E S + M O T O R S
plane-crazy 2020-06-22 12:26:28 yes, this is a trap door
plane-crazy 2020-06-11 18:32:05 seems like rick removed the "!fps" command ;-;

plane-crazy 2020-05-22 01:20:31 the irony of the paint tool's color being white/gray lol
plane-crazy 2020-05-13 18:43:15 what should i make out of this nose? a 777, an a330, a 767, or should i make multiple planes using this design
plane-crazy 2020-05-12 02:12:11 party in the test server with rick a few hours ago
plane-crazy 2020-05-11 18:44:59 it wouldnt be half as bad if roblox had a way to transfer robux freely
plane-crazy 2020-05-11 18:42:35 people have alts
plane-crazy 2020-05-11 18:37:23 almost ***300*** robux for some sounds
plane-crazy 2020-05-11 18:36:03 <:Thonk:509498568982134816>
plane-crazy 2020-05-11 18:34:32 jetpack, speaker blocks, gravity... tbh, those things kind of DO help you succeed at this game... <:Thonk:509498568982134816>
plane-crazy 2020-05-11 18:31:10 plane crazy is not supposed to be pay to win right?
plane-crazy 2020-05-10 11:44:43 build a plane sounds like some clickbait cringe
plane-crazy 2020-05-10 01:05:43 w h y  t h e  r e  n a m e
plane-crazy 2020-05-08 02:25:46 just rolling through...
plane-crazy 2020-05-06 22:10:00 i have a feeling that this will end in some real bad pain for my avatars area...
plane-crazy 2020-05-06 01:56:45 "You spin me right round, baby" lol
plane-crazy 2020-04-24 13:03:31 maybe take a piston that slides a block into a hole to lock it, or maybe use motors to make some sort of claw/hook to keep them together
plane-crazy 2020-04-24 02:36:04 make that 435 errors now lol
plane-crazy 2020-04-24 02:32:03 433 errors lol... feel free to try and understand them XD
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 16:25:11 lol, my missiles can be used for the following: torpedoes, air to air, ar to ground, kamikaze ships, yeeting people.
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 16:15:38 lol, one of my missiles misfired, and then smacked my wing and yeeted me into infinity
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 16:09:42 interesting... 1 type of missile can be used as air to air, AND air to ground...
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 12:50:31 speed? or block count?
plane-crazy 2020-04-14 12:23:38 .
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 18:36:07 they say the game is not pay to win. the jetpack contradicts that.
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 02:41:05 rip
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 02:23:03 most likely one of those
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 02:22:45 or hit the fans
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 02:22:40 you got shot down if you were in pvp
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 02:17:09 once again
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 02:15:33 despite the countless bugs and glitches, the lighting has proved its worth to me. it really added some more realism to this.
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 18:53:36 lol
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 18:32:30 ive spent literally 5 hours trying to get it to work on my current plane
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 18:32:01 its made a huge difference to everything i make with an ejector seat
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 18:30:49 see, they dont weld, but they have ridiculously high amounts of friction
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 18:28:19 yup
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 18:28:02 there is no weld on the sides of the chairs
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 18:27:43 the chair moves
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 18:27:38 /nope
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 18:21:07 see. the chairs are at unnecessarily high levels of friction
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 18:16:46 they can barely move when i try and move them
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 18:16:12 apparently, chairs have a super high amount of friction
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 18:15:44 but
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 18:15:41 idk what happened
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 02:01:06 here it is. the hovering jet. it does it twice, once at the beginning, once at the end
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 01:55:35 aaannd i got it!
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 01:53:38 a few more slight upgrades and i might  be able to get it to stay still, instead of moving around a few blocks
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 01:52:20 one simple upgrade to my F-20, and its hovering just doubled in quality
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 01:49:42 lol
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 01:49:05 wait wut? how did people get these awards yesterday
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 01:48:01 its the invisible glitch
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 01:34:43 probably the newest record
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 01:34:20 we got 6.3k!!
plane-crazy 2020-04-06 23:49:53 we got front page once again
plane-crazy 2020-04-06 21:21:26 it is in beta <:Thinkje139:590548255927173201>
plane-crazy 2020-04-03 01:59:41 well, its like a conveyor drive on steroids, so i guess
plane-crazy 2020-04-03 01:46:01 has this drive already been invented? it can go aprox 10k speed if it is going straight
plane-crazy 2020-04-02 13:19:01 besides the tail rotor
plane-crazy 2020-04-02 13:18:44 ive seen many helis made using single rotors, and most of them actually work. is there some sort of counter torque that stops the spinning?
plane-crazy 2020-04-02 13:16:43 im new to single rotor helis, and i am aware that the heli spins with single rotors sometimes, but how would i make this setup work for my hind without it spinning like crazy
plane-crazy 2020-03-29 13:19:21 that worked, thanks
plane-crazy 2020-03-29 13:18:47 k
plane-crazy 2020-03-29 13:18:00 the one to retract the gear works, but the suspension system doesnt work
plane-crazy 2020-03-29 13:17:02 nope, wasn't the anchor
plane-crazy 2020-03-29 13:16:39 they should be working correctly
plane-crazy 2020-03-29 13:16:29 yup
plane-crazy 2020-03-29 13:16:23 k
plane-crazy 2020-03-29 13:15:33 i have the anchor off and it wont move either
plane-crazy 2020-03-29 13:15:12 ye
plane-crazy 2020-03-29 13:14:29 i made a landing gear strut for my upcoming a330, but none of the motors will move, even though nothing is touching them in the wrong place. they are also at 100 torque and 1 speed. anyone know a fix for this?
plane-crazy 2020-03-27 01:46:13 a stick of butter buttering on a slice of bread
plane-crazy 2020-03-27 01:45:57 buttering the bread just got real:
plane-crazy 2020-03-26 16:11:19 and then butters lol
plane-crazy 2020-03-26 16:11:05 you know the world is broken when you see a heli do this:
plane-crazy 2020-03-24 21:43:45 reeeee this acc will prob get banned
plane-crazy 2020-03-24 21:43:29 my 13th acc for this game is Cursed_Concorde... unlucky 13... name has cursed in it... <:Thinkje139:590548255927173201>
plane-crazy 2020-03-24 13:02:34 idk if this has already been made yet, but i found a hover drive that goes from 300-1000 when used with less than 100 blocks
