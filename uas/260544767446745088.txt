plane-crazy 2020-04-20 12:57:07 most bombers get built because free upvotes!!!1
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 12:57:01 looks like it'd actually do well in pvp unlike every other bomber that i see, but thats not really the point of most bombers, ironically
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 12:56:40 yeah, it looks neat
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 12:55:49 i have a few bomber ideas of my own that i want to put to the test
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 12:55:23 i like custom bomber builds, much more freedom to make them as crazy as you want
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 12:55:03 like it looks cool
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 12:55:00 it's just neat
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 12:54:57 neato is like

plane-crazy 2020-03-12 16:54:50 and just like a real bacteriophage, it causes the thing it injected to explode from the inside
plane-crazy 2020-03-12 16:54:21 then it releases the "dna"
plane-crazy 2020-03-12 16:54:11 so it uses its pooper to punch a hole in a build with cutters,
plane-crazy 2020-03-12 16:53:44 actually, head, for accuracy
plane-crazy 2020-03-12 16:53:28 its going to have a shitload of bombs because of the massive neck

plane-crazy 2020-03-12 16:52:08 i also plan on actually making it capable of releasing its DNA
plane-crazy 2020-03-12 16:51:56 theyre complex structures

plane-crazy 2020-03-06 01:25:31 like it's pretty obvious that the gotha g.v has rear-facing props
plane-crazy 2020-03-06 01:25:16 on such a huge plane, too

1. don't have a rank
2. are rude as fuck
3. just posted a picture you took with your phone of some shitty 10 block plane that shouldn't even be able to fly
plane-crazy 2020-03-06 01:20:16 literally the engines of the plane, not a small specification
plane-crazy 2020-03-06 01:20:10 it's
plane-crazy 2020-03-06 01:19:33 all of the submissions that i see have forward-facing propellors
plane-crazy 2020-03-06 01:19:11 im literally the only person to submit a correctly built Gotha G.V
plane-crazy 2020-03-06 01:19:02 after doing a bit of searching
plane-crazy 2020-03-06 01:18:56 also I just noticed,
plane-crazy 2020-03-06 01:16:49 frankly it's my first flying machine with 1k+ blocks that wasn't a flying boat and im proud
plane-crazy 2020-03-06 01:16:28 after working on it for a day and a half
plane-crazy 2020-03-06 01:16:24 i just finished my Gotha G.V
plane-crazy 2020-03-06 01:16:16 his screen is D
plane-crazy 2020-03-01 16:03:48 <@!263959626804887552> that looks neat as fuck, is it yours?
plane-crazy 2020-02-29 23:01:26 but a guy who literally posted a carbon copy of somebody's cessna-172 tutorial build and then posted it to creations chat downvoted my 4k block ship
plane-crazy 2020-02-29 23:01:11 usually i don't complain about downvotes
plane-crazy 2020-02-29 22:07:10 and it even works under water!

plane-crazy 2020-02-26 19:16:36 more like a dumpster
plane-crazy 2020-02-26 19:16:30 its not hell, persay
plane-crazy 2020-02-26 19:16:19 but its a "4chan server"
plane-crazy 2020-02-26 19:16:04 im a mod on a server thats the same size as this one
plane-crazy 2020-02-26 19:15:53 ive done mod stuff before
plane-crazy 2020-02-26 19:15:48 ill submit one
plane-crazy 2020-02-26 19:14:04 and the first tank battle recorded in history
plane-crazy 2020-02-26 19:13:49 first usage of tanks in modern warfare
plane-crazy 2020-02-26 19:13:35 s  m h
plane-crazy 2020-02-26 19:13:19 flers courcelette or villon britonneaux
plane-crazy 2020-02-26 19:13:06 for you both
plane-crazy 2020-02-26 19:13:01 also quick question
plane-crazy 2020-02-26 19:12:54 thats cool and all but the bible app is free
plane-crazy 2020-02-26 19:12:45 i see you are admin
plane-crazy 2020-02-26 19:12:40 hello obc
plane-crazy 2020-02-26 19:12:23 <:YouTried:559530066258821131>
plane-crazy 2020-02-26 19:12:14 un de momnent
plane-crazy 2020-02-26 19:11:08 "kinda functional" isnt totally functional
plane-crazy 2020-02-26 18:26:52 i cry
plane-crazy 2020-02-26 18:26:50 tfw no response
plane-crazy 2020-02-26 16:51:22 i dont really want to use beams but i'll have to
plane-crazy 2020-02-26 16:48:32 so ill be substituting paint blocks and anchor blocks for regular blocks
plane-crazy 2020-02-26 16:48:14 the bow alone is 1,100 blocks and its barely done
plane-crazy 2020-02-26 16:48:01 im also working on probably my largest build yet
plane-crazy 2020-02-26 16:43:42 a lifesize model of the battle of Flers-Courcelette
plane-crazy 2020-02-26 16:43:32 okay so
plane-crazy 2020-02-26 16:42:47 only fitting that I do Flers-Courcelette
plane-crazy 2020-02-26 16:42:31 my friend decided for me since his birthday is on September 15th
plane-crazy 2020-02-26 16:42:14 okay its decided
plane-crazy 2020-02-26 16:42:08 but
plane-crazy 2020-02-26 16:42:07 lifesize
plane-crazy 2020-02-26 16:33:46 i might also animate it, if its a lifesize scaled model
plane-crazy 2020-02-26 16:29:57 opinions?
plane-crazy 2020-02-26 16:29:47 however if I make it a map, I can have all 32 Mark IVs if its a fold
plane-crazy 2020-02-26 16:29:24 if its large scale, itll be a strip of a trench, probably with a Mark IV rolling over it
plane-crazy 2020-02-26 16:29:00 large scale or a map though
plane-crazy 2020-02-26 16:28:42 just going to rebuild the trench lines, probably
plane-crazy 2020-02-26 16:28:00 or the 2nd Battle of Villers-Bretonneux
plane-crazy 2020-02-26 16:27:12 gonna make a model of the Battle of Flers-Courcelette
plane-crazy 2020-02-26 16:26:55 had an idea
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 19:28:49 n o
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 19:28:48 i draw like a paraplegic dolphin
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 19:27:44 im just going to make an alt account dedicated to creating dead fish builds
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 19:27:28 i need to make a bigger dead fish
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 19:27:01 thank FUCK
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 19:25:06 why cant my good creations get that many upvotes
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 19:24:55 does this have 36 upvotes
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 19:24:48 why
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 19:23:40 <:pogey:651848693842182144>
plane-crazy 2020-02-24 22:14:03 gonna hop into vip 1
plane-crazy 2020-02-24 22:13:30 oh and a mobile vehicle bay
plane-crazy 2020-02-24 22:12:59 noice
plane-crazy 2020-02-24 22:06:10 i swear somebody had a seamoth
plane-crazy 2020-02-24 22:04:57 dead sea monster gaming
plane-crazy 2020-02-24 22:04:14 vibing with skeletal remains
plane-crazy 2020-02-24 20:15:08 what
plane-crazy 2020-02-24 20:13:40 haha
plane-crazy 2020-02-24 20:13:37 funny shape
plane-crazy 2020-02-24 20:11:55 
plane-crazy 2020-02-24 20:11:06

plane-crazy 2020-02-24 20:09:07 
plane-crazy 2020-02-24 20:08:12 im trying hard to delete the text block rn
plane-crazy 2020-02-24 20:07:04 exhaustion
plane-crazy 2020-02-23 21:09:56 dear god it works
plane-crazy 2020-02-23 21:05:44 🙏🕋
plane-crazy 2020-02-23 21:04:44 is it allah? 😳
plane-crazy 2020-02-23 21:04:43 what's it gonna be?
plane-crazy 2020-02-23 21:04:34 looks nice
plane-crazy 2020-02-23 21:03:42 it's had limited success
plane-crazy 2020-02-23 21:03:37 just use ballast blocks to hold it down underwater, and then use friction blocks on its legs to allow it to grip to the ground and walk
plane-crazy 2020-02-23 21:03:18 i have a very, very bad abstract idea of what i should do
plane-crazy 2020-02-23 21:03:13 i am making an underwater walker
plane-crazy 2020-02-20 19:01:51 with conveyors
plane-crazy 2020-02-20 19:01:46 if i rebuilt it
plane-crazy 2020-02-20 19:01:43 so i wonder
plane-crazy 2020-02-20 19:01:37 i had a 3k speed plane that actually stalled at 2.5k and it only used super rockets
plane-crazy 2020-02-20 19:01:11 nice
plane-crazy 2020-02-20 19:00:56 i detached all the weapons as well
plane-crazy 2020-02-20 19:00:49 so no landing gear, no cockpit, no aimable guns
plane-crazy 2020-02-20 19:00:25 it goes so fast that i actually had to weld everything that was attached to a motor
plane-crazy 2020-02-20 19:00:04 i have 4 conveyor engines on one of my planes
plane-crazy 2020-02-20 18:53:14 it barely works on any build
plane-crazy 2020-02-20 18:53:03 mhm
plane-crazy 2020-02-20 18:52:55 we need 1x1-4
plane-crazy 2020-02-20 18:52:47 the 1x2 is a step in the right direction but
plane-crazy 2020-02-20 18:52:30 id also like more diverse control surface shapes
plane-crazy 2020-02-20 18:52:15 mhm
plane-crazy 2020-02-20 18:50:44 im gonna go around and see who wants to join in
plane-crazy 2020-02-20 18:50:31 one of these beasts
plane-crazy 2020-02-20 18:50:03 ive already decided that im going to build a Sopwith Camel
plane-crazy 2020-02-20 18:49:10 anybody in?
plane-crazy 2020-02-20 18:48:46 but i want to create a flying circus of miniature ww1-era planes
plane-crazy 2020-02-20 18:48:15 not a connected one, that would be cheating
plane-crazy 2020-02-20 18:48:05 i plan on making a mini airfleet
plane-crazy 2020-02-15 14:45:20 so no more guessing where my missiles will hit now
plane-crazy 2020-02-15 14:44:52 line on the bottom is for aiming the guns
plane-crazy 2020-02-15 14:44:48 middle line has the [:::] areas lined up exactly with my missiles so they're easier to aim
plane-crazy 2020-02-15 14:44:35 line on the top is just aesthetic
plane-crazy 2020-02-15 14:44:26 made myself a better aiming reticle
plane-crazy 2020-02-15 14:44:22 
plane-crazy 2020-02-14 23:53:55 i was sitting there like "next slide please"
plane-crazy 2020-02-14 23:53:44 did anybody else just have their game turn into a powerpoint presentation with its FPS
plane-crazy 2020-02-14 19:26:29 mmnotthatiknowof
plane-crazy 2020-02-14 18:07:54 i have an idea actually.
plane-crazy 2020-02-14 18:07:42 then I won't
plane-crazy 2020-02-14 18:07:36 mm
plane-crazy 2020-02-14 18:05:48 just because i want to mog the tutorial planes.
plane-crazy 2020-02-14 18:05:38 but its going to be a giant folding one
plane-crazy 2020-02-14 18:05:31 that everyone makes
plane-crazy 2020-02-14 18:05:25 im going to make that one tutorial plane
plane-crazy 2020-02-14 18:05:11 ok
plane-crazy 2020-02-14 13:42:07 cant access my pc rn and im trying to explain conveyor drives to a new friend
plane-crazy 2020-02-14 13:41:55 anybody have a screenshot of just a conveyor drive on them?
plane-crazy 2020-02-14 04:09:51 h e lp
plane-crazy 2020-02-14 03:01:19 oh god oh fuck
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 23:57:47 <@!429826358827417601> this thing pushes 1.8k. should I go for something faster?
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 23:57:35 https://gyazo.com/275227c5a762052077af059d5329dce0
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 17:37:33 would it work?
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 17:37:24 ok but really what do you think of making a chainsword
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 17:37:07 <:OmegaTroll:626841385118597152>
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 17:36:50 also thanks for reaction imagw
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 17:36:44 just babbling
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 17:36:22 do they even *work*
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 17:36:16 has anybody even done that
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 17:36:00 what do you guys think of making a chainsword with cutters?
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 17:35:38 not just in force of the swing but also function
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 17:35:19 to see how powerful i can make a melee weapon
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 17:35:11 im going to make a battlebot tonight
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 17:35:02 heavy object + high speed + cutters = a very bad time
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 17:34:30 hell if it has a really wide swing to it, add in more power with rockets
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 17:34:13 basically if you make a melee weapon, no such thing as too much force
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 17:33:48 which are possible thanks to cutters
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 17:33:41 you want that "oomph", especially on melee weapons
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 17:33:21 if its on a limb or its moving a turret, 1k torque works
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 17:32:55 except for on wheels
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 17:32:35 i always max out motors
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 17:32:16 basically if its over 700 blocks, use 1k torque
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 17:32:05 1k torque good for tanks
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 17:31:54 yeah
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 17:31:44 you need lots of torque for heavy vehicles
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 17:31:08 1k torque ok
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 17:31:03 500 torque good
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 02:10:25 jkjk
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 02:10:23 hold on let me look for where i asked
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 00:34:55 they're not that hard or complex
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 00:34:45 <@!530539224781553694> i've made several builds with flying wings
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 00:07:58 what
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 00:04:20 😳
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 00:04:17 i really do have that 3rd world country wifi doe
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 00:03:52 aussie internet
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 00:03:28 this be a moment of the bro
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 00:03:28 i said "aussie internet" and then crashed immediately
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 00:03:24 <@!437078588701933568> <:Wokeje139:604492580369203210>

plane-crazy 2020-02-11 18:53:16 wait shit thats.. the fucking point
plane-crazy 2020-02-11 18:53:09 i live near an air force base and on my life ive never seen a black plane
plane-crazy 2020-02-11 18:52:54 ive never seen black fighters
plane-crazy 2020-02-11 18:52:42 <:pogey:651848693842182144>
plane-crazy 2020-02-11 18:52:29 ok.

plane-crazy 2020-02-11 18:51:29 they dont need to be
plane-crazy 2020-02-11 18:51:17 fighter planes arent ever painted black or dark gray
plane-crazy 2020-02-11 18:51:02 should be gray
plane-crazy 2020-02-11 18:50:52 its black
plane-crazy 2020-02-11 14:47:52 I ha

plane-crazy 2020-02-10 02:22:04 goodnight trump supporter
plane-crazy 2020-02-10 02:06:12 okay thank god I was in a public server for whatever reason
plane-crazy 2020-02-10 02:05:28 this always happens at this hour of the night too for some reason
plane-crazy 2020-02-10 02:05:28 my internet was fine for a good 2 minutes then stopped working
plane-crazy 2020-02-10 02:05:27 ugh
plane-crazy 2020-02-10 02:03:12 did i join a public server
plane-crazy 2020-02-10 02:03:06 no way im in a private server
plane-crazy 2020-02-10 02:02:44 
plane-crazy 2020-02-10 02:00:42 tfw
plane-crazy 2020-02-10 02:00:41 yep I did
plane-crazy 2020-02-10 02:00:14 i hope i didn't just jynx it-
plane-crazy 2020-02-10 01:59:54 also my internet seems to be working
plane-crazy 2020-02-10 01:59:29 <:un_de:588499111544619009>
plane-crazy 2020-02-10 01:59:28 i don't even know who unde is
plane-crazy 2020-02-10 01:59:22 well
plane-crazy 2020-02-10 01:58:26 mkay
plane-crazy 2020-02-10 01:55:48 private server 1
plane-crazy 2020-02-10 01:55:38 i'm trying to join rn but my internet poopy shit stinky
plane-crazy 2020-02-10 01:55:19 is he in ps1?
plane-crazy 2020-02-10 01:55:09 yikes
plane-crazy 2020-02-10 01:54:52 nice
plane-crazy 2020-02-10 01:45:28 might be hard considering the shell will be basically non functional
plane-crazy 2020-02-10 01:44:52 so a plane with a shell is possible
plane-crazy 2020-02-10 01:44:41 ah
plane-crazy 2020-02-10 01:44:34 i might make it a hangar
plane-crazy 2020-02-10 01:44:21 the plane on the outside is just a shell
plane-crazy 2020-02-10 01:44:08 no?
plane-crazy 2020-02-10 01:43:52 so basically its a plane inside a plane
plane-crazy 2020-02-10 01:43:17 one idea i had was a fighter jet encased inside one of those huge, blocky "noob planes" that would take off and have its blocky outer shell burst away to reveal the jet underneath
plane-crazy 2020-02-10 01:41:57 these are my 5 options
plane-crazy 2020-02-10 01:41:52 theme here is sci fi.. sortof
1. tie fighter or some variation of it

2. a literal tie fighter. an airplane in the shape of a tie.

3. type-52 separatist phantom from halo 3 (might be over 1200 though)

4. millenial falcon, a millenium falcon except for millenials, crushing student loans and all.

5. a massive version of the tutorial plane
plane-crazy 2020-02-10 01:37:03 i have a few planes to choose from to build in order to get that
plane-crazy 2020-02-10 01:36:48 ok so im going to try for aeronautical engineer 3
plane-crazy 2020-02-10 00:59:00 what is un de and why is un de
plane-crazy 2020-02-10 00:59:00 who is un de
plane-crazy 2020-02-10 00:57:03 who even is unde
plane-crazy 2020-02-10 00:56:28 <:un_de:588499111544619009>
plane-crazy 2020-02-10 00:48:06 existential crisis? cringe
plane-crazy 2020-02-10 00:30:29 so it floats
plane-crazy 2020-02-10 00:30:25 now I have to go and put in ballast tanks on my boat
plane-crazy 2020-02-10 00:30:19 yeah I guess
plane-crazy 2020-02-10 00:23:52 
plane-crazy 2020-02-10 00:21:12 a dinghy
plane-crazy 2020-02-10 00:21:11 why give a landing craft
plane-crazy 2020-02-10 00:20:59 also it looks like a transport ship
plane-crazy 2020-02-10 00:20:48 a fat why
plane-crazy 2020-02-10 00:20:46 its not even mine its just
plane-crazy 2020-02-10 00:20:39 it's a boat called "the landmaster"
plane-crazy 2020-02-10 00:20:31 llook @ this
plane-crazy 2020-02-10 00:20:13 read pls
plane-crazy 2020-02-10 00:20:03 the front of that ford
plane-crazy 2020-02-10 00:19:30 looks nice
plane-crazy 2020-02-10 00:19:18 be nice if i could see it from more than 1 angle
plane-crazy 2020-02-10 00:13:10 this one turned out much better than the last
plane-crazy 2020-02-10 00:13:02 finally done my 2nd folding boat
plane-crazy 2020-02-09 22:11:23 this is the perfectly timed screenshot that i took milliseconds before it struck my boat and i crashed
plane-crazy 2020-02-09 22:09:02 LMFAO
plane-crazy 2020-02-09 22:08:58 YOU CRASHED ME
plane-crazy 2020-02-09 22:08:55 <@!343855515555725315> I CRASHED
plane-crazy 2020-02-09 21:05:15 somebody sounds mad <:pogey:651848693842182144>
plane-crazy 2020-02-09 21:04:22 most railguns are immobile anyways so i don't think it matters
plane-crazy 2020-02-09 21:04:14 or it's literally a turret
plane-crazy 2020-02-09 21:04:10 ^
plane-crazy 2020-02-09 21:03:34 <:pogey:651848693842182144> doesn't take away from the fact that you tried to shoot me, knowing you were blacklisted
plane-crazy 2020-02-09 21:03:14 the shot did ricochet off a blacklist wall
plane-crazy 2020-02-09 21:03:04 guess i saw wrong <:pogey:651848693842182144>
plane-crazy 2020-02-09 21:02:52 no point
plane-crazy 2020-02-09 21:02:50 heavy bullets
plane-crazy 2020-02-09 21:02:20 cant stand up, balls too heavy <:pogey:651848693842182144>
plane-crazy 2020-02-09 21:02:12 ballast balls
plane-crazy 2020-02-09 21:01:42 i even recorded it hold on
plane-crazy 2020-02-09 21:01:30 <:pogey:651848693842182144>
plane-crazy 2020-02-09 21:01:27 i saw the shot hit the ground
plane-crazy 2020-02-09 21:01:18 you can't deny it
plane-crazy 2020-02-09 21:01:15 i was kind of on the other side of the barrel bro
plane-crazy 2020-02-09 21:01:11 i saw the shot ricochet off the ground, not a wall
plane-crazy 2020-02-09 21:01:02 you missed the wall anyways <:pogey:651848693842182144>
plane-crazy 2020-02-09 21:00:57 not that it matters
plane-crazy 2020-02-09 21:00:36 you weren't blacklisted <:pogey:651848693842182144>
plane-crazy 2020-02-09 21:00:08 it was actually kind of sad to watch
plane-crazy 2020-02-09 20:59:54 didn't even hit my build that takes up the whole plot, your shot just ricocheted off the ground
plane-crazy 2020-02-09 20:59:33 yes you missed by a fucking mile
plane-crazy 2020-02-09 20:59:23 <:pogey:651848693842182144>

plane-crazy 2020-02-09 20:58:42 
plane-crazy 2020-02-09 20:58:23 he tried to shoot me with that exact railgun
plane-crazy 2020-02-09 20:58:18 yeah that thing
plane-crazy 2020-02-09 20:58:14 <@!505835349889777685> i'm just a fuckin G
plane-crazy 2020-02-09 20:57:57 he missed by a nautical mile <:pogey:651848693842182144>
plane-crazy 2020-02-09 20:57:51 he also pulled out a pretty sick looking railgun and tried to shoot me
plane-crazy 2020-02-09 20:57:25 first date vibes is inside joke that i can't explain
plane-crazy 2020-02-09 20:57:02 awesome
plane-crazy 2020-02-09 20:56:40 so i just hit f12 and recorded
plane-crazy 2020-02-09 20:56:29 he kinda caught me off guard
plane-crazy 2020-02-09 20:56:25 i could just hit f12 and be done with it but i wasn't ready
plane-crazy 2020-02-09 20:56:14 i didn't have time to get anything else
plane-crazy 2020-02-09 20:55:45 either way doesn't matter because you can clearly see what he's doing
plane-crazy 2020-02-09 20:55:37 tfw i run at 60 fps but the video quality is like 3 fps
plane-crazy 2020-02-09 20:55:09 thanks

plane-crazy 2020-02-09 20:51:55 i dont think so
plane-crazy 2020-02-09 20:51:25 i caught it on video anyways
plane-crazy 2020-02-09 20:50:58 don't care if he catches wind and leaves, he's gone either way

plane-crazy 2020-02-07 01:37:46 since you can't really throw hand grenades out of the cockpit of your plane yet, that's as close as i'm gonna get to an early great war bomber lmao
plane-crazy 2020-02-07 01:37:13 i decided to give it a singular, weak bomb on the underside of the plane
plane-crazy 2020-02-07 01:35:44 ❤️
plane-crazy 2020-02-07 01:35:42 thanks
plane-crazy 2020-02-07 01:35:38 published it in creations so I don't gotta repost it
plane-crazy 2020-02-07 01:35:26 also just finished my fokker dr-1
plane-crazy 2020-02-07 01:34:18 ...besides, getting that close to somebody's build when you have a *gun* is pretty unneeded.
plane-crazy 2020-02-07 01:33:54 cutters would just slice off the part you're trying to grab onto
plane-crazy 2020-02-07 01:33:45 it wouldn't be able to clamp*

plane-crazy 2020-02-05 18:29:30 any improvements that you can think of?
plane-crazy 2020-02-05 18:29:18 lads
plane-crazy 2020-02-05 18:29:17 
plane-crazy 2020-02-05 14:35:14 b29s are shiny
plane-crazy 2020-02-05 14:35:08 yeah
plane-crazy 2020-02-05 14:29:17 so the b29 will be an easy build
plane-crazy 2020-02-05 14:29:09 it doesnt thin out at the end very much as well
plane-crazy 2020-02-05 14:28:56 yes perfect
plane-crazy 2020-02-05 14:28:46 the entire body of a b29 is basically the same as a submarine
plane-crazy 2020-02-05 14:28:35 ^
plane-crazy 2020-02-05 14:28:25 triangle block wedges and triangle wedges do the trick
plane-crazy 2020-02-05 14:28:05 but
plane-crazy 2020-02-05 14:28:03 circles are hard
plane-crazy 2020-02-05 14:27:47 <@351848864531218442> i know how to make it
plane-crazy 2020-02-05 14:20:45 itll have to be on my alt

plane-crazy 2020-02-05 14:19:44 but i cant cheat, obviously, by just slapping on some water propellors
plane-crazy 2020-02-05 14:19:28 so just making an amphibious tank would count
plane-crazy 2020-02-05 14:19:17 so it is possible
plane-crazy 2020-02-05 14:19:11 oh nice
plane-crazy 2020-02-05 14:19:06 ok??
plane-crazy 2020-02-05 14:16:51 but im pretty good at land vehicles
plane-crazy 2020-02-05 14:16:45 im bad at planes
plane-crazy 2020-02-05 14:16:29 i cant do it lole
plane-crazy 2020-02-05 14:16:21 definitely

plane-crazy 2020-02-05 01:37:40 like it was long
plane-crazy 2020-02-05 01:37:29 it wasn't even that large
plane-crazy 2020-02-05 01:37:18 yeah.
plane-crazy 2020-02-05 01:37:17 well, unfolded
plane-crazy 2020-02-05 01:37:11 yeah his was folded.
plane-crazy 2020-02-05 01:37:05 yknow how people fold ships
plane-crazy 2020-02-05 01:36:45 idk bro some dude with a folded tank came up to me and started insulting my tank
plane-crazy 2020-02-05 01:36:20 yeah couldn't be me

plane-crazy 2020-02-05 01:35:37 you guys ever finish a build that you're really proud of, then some dude with a 3,000 block superheavy tank that barely fits inside of its build area, even though it's folded, comes up and calls yours a piece of trash and lays into your tank while you're afk

plane-crazy 2020-02-05 00:34:43 i found that they also don't work when you're moving
plane-crazy 2020-02-05 00:33:57 I guess I'm bringing back the old gun, then
plane-crazy 2020-02-05 00:33:04 just what I called it
plane-crazy 2020-02-05 00:33:00 firework gun, yes.
plane-crazy 2020-02-05 00:31:10 the missiles actually fly straight, and for some reason tilt upwards slightly *but continue flying forwards in a straight line,* which is *exactly* what I want, basically guaruntees that the bombs are going to slap their target and detonate
plane-crazy 2020-02-05 00:30:35 the armaments of my plane so far. one firework gun, unguided rocket pods on either side and two larger missiles as well
plane-crazy 2020-02-05 00:17:04 the ones that ya mount on your planes, preferrably able to fit under the wings.
plane-crazy 2020-02-05 00:16:32 could anybody give some tips on making missiles?

plane-crazy 2020-02-04 23:30:59 i uh
plane-crazy 2020-02-04 23:30:49 also <@!426156778007429140> about the size of the turret that you brought up, it's meant to be a small target
plane-crazy 2020-02-04 23:29:07 then I'll switch over to what I was suggested to see if there's improvements
plane-crazy 2020-02-04 23:28:53 alright I'm going to real quick do my own thing before taking the suggestions I was given
plane-crazy 2020-02-04 23:28:14 but yeah they are similar, my turret is just way in the back.
plane-crazy 2020-02-04 23:27:59 i try to keep controls to a minimum on my tanks
plane-crazy 2020-02-04 23:27:49 looks pretty nice
plane-crazy 2020-02-04 23:26:22 alright, I'll do that
plane-crazy 2020-02-04 23:26:16 yeah it is a boring colour
plane-crazy 2020-02-04 23:25:55 just bucket tooled it, how's this colour look as well as the placement of the sand
plane-crazy 2020-02-04 23:25:00 but I've made some changes like changing the material to sand
plane-crazy 2020-02-04 23:24:49 didn't take too long to do
plane-crazy 2020-02-04 23:24:46 i might make the whole tank darker and re-do the colours
plane-crazy 2020-02-04 23:24:03 or maybe a burnt orange
plane-crazy 2020-02-04 23:23:54 I might change the blue to red
plane-crazy 2020-02-04 23:23:47 this is the render I based the tank's colour scheme off of
plane-crazy 2020-02-04 23:23:39 <@!426156778007429140>
