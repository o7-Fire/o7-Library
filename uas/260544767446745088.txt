creations-chat 2019-04-13 16:29:13 Boat that I spent around 4 hours building; hull is mostly comprised of wedges and 1x1 blocks since I hate using beams. Constructed entirely in one go and equipped with an elevator, one deck gun and a set of detachable wheels to bring it from land to sea.

creations-chat 2020-02-04 22:48:15 M808B Scorpion I threw together today after playing Halo 3. Decided to take a colour scheme from a render of the tank from Halo 5 and apply it to the Halo Reach/3/ODST version.
creations-chat 2020-02-04 22:50:11 Full block count, took about two hours to build. Luckily, I made very few mistakes while building this. The hardest part was probably figuring out which blocks were causing the treads to attach to the main hull of the vehicle. The suspension works the same as it does in the video games, however it's a little wonky and disabled in the screenshots I took.

creations-chat 2020-02-04 23:20:31 the blue colour is apart of the tank,
creations-chat 2020-02-04 23:20:40 and I did state in another channel that it wasn't 100% complete.
creations-chat 2020-02-04 23:20:58 there's still improvements to be made, but i'll definitely consider what you said and apply it to the build, and see if it's improved
creations-chat 2020-02-04 23:21:15 I'm actually working on the colour scheme and the camoflauge right now, so it's definitely going to change very soon

creations-chat 2020-02-05 00:51:29 a close up of what's under the wing/the armaments. basically the lava spewers in the back are bombs, that are meant to be dropped onto large boats or just anywhere on the map. the whole idea is that they spaz the fuck out once they land and do damage in a wider area than the bombs might be able to reach. they can also act as landmines.. i guess. everything else is pretty basic, air-to-ground missiles and some secondary guns, since the one in the front is pretty large and prone to getting shot off as i've found.
creations-chat 2020-02-05 00:53:26 features brakes that can send it from its max speed of 485 right down to 0 in like 4 seconds once it hits the ground. i can land this thing at top speed on a decently sized carrier pretty reliably, assuming roblox physics decide to behave.

creations-chat 2020-02-05 01:41:21 it's probably more effective to legit just shoot the plane down onto the carrier than it is to use the cable
creations-chat 2020-02-05 01:41:43 *either way the same effect is achieved. the plane gets fucked up beyond recovery 9 times out of 10 anyways.*

creations-chat 2020-02-05 02:26:06 exactly what it sounds like
creations-chat 2020-02-05 02:26:18 basically there was this whole fiasco over greek fire and people who used it against the people who hated it
creations-chat 2020-02-05 02:26:43 blew up into the entire concept of fire-based weapons being banned entirely from the roleplay
creations-chat 2020-02-05 02:27:05 so basically unless it was magical, you could not use fire as a weapon
creations-chat 2020-02-05 02:27:21 <:FineTroll:626841259746656289>it was dumb
creations-chat 2020-02-05 02:28:56 anyways here's a recent build of mine that I made when I was bored. didn't go into much detail on this one, just wanted a big vehicle.
creations-chat 2020-02-05 02:29:33 
creations-chat 2020-02-05 02:31:49 it's also amphibious
creations-chat 2020-02-05 03:13:48 Finally finished my Scorpion, decided to name it after my friend's chainsaw which he used to cut a subway sandwhich (and nearly cut his kitchen table) in half with, while on video call with myself and a few others. 
Changed up the colour scheme, added on some new aesthetic features. Firepower (which is just 4 unguided rockets inside the barrel) remains the same.
creations-chat 2020-02-05 03:14:41 view from another angle. madlad drew a heart on his chainsaw with a crayon, so I also put a heart on the tank.
creations-chat 2020-02-05 03:15:43 tank v. tank kill count carved onto the side of the turret
creations-chat 2020-02-05 03:16:17 and finally the block count
