creations-chat 2023-07-16 22:07:42 tell me what is wrong with the spinosaur
creations-chat 2023-07-16 22:09:49 why do creatures not get nearly as many votes as vehicles
creations-chat 2023-07-16 22:18:00 its good idk why people want others to make the greates build in PC history

creations-chat 2023-07-16 22:22:25 i think he means my spinosaur
creations-chat 2023-07-16 22:25:08 i can build howerver i want as long as it satisfies me, plus no way im gonna make it kaiju sized just for details, also the spine only has a size problem are you talking about the jurassic park spinosaurus? i do know the legs are too big and the arms kinda thick, the head might be weird but i think everything else is fine.
creations-chat 2023-07-16 22:28:41 yes cats are cute
creations-chat 2023-07-16 22:51:37 i do not care, all i care about is that my builds satisfy me.
creations-chat 2023-07-16 22:54:06 my spinosaurus has gone through many changes before not to satisfy others (although people ingame say its cool) but to satisfy me.
creations-chat 2023-07-16 22:56:39 well maybe i do, but i only asked "why do creatures not get nearly as many votes as vehicles" and said that i thought the spinosaur was fine. that's getting pissed to you?

creations-chat 2023-07-17 21:01:15 i didnt expect the sail remodel to get no downvotes, maybe its because i decided to fix the spino<:clueless:942802644043464734>
