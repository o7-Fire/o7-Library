creations-chat 2023-04-04 22:10:48 i think you should make it so that the glass looks like it's englobing you, and some half wedges 1x2 on the white part, on the side you know.
the-dump 2023-04-06 03:48:15 yeah let's call it like that
the-dump 2023-04-06 03:49:26 i watched every episode of the anime, i also watched the weird movies they made after, they are cool and they represent the horror that titans would represent irl, but the colossal titan in the movies is weird and goofy

help 2023-04-06 04:21:38 i've been creating a suspension system for a jeep rubicon i am planning to do, and i've realised the back part of my system doesn't lift, the error might have occured in the pistons, motor blocks, or suspension i am still unsure. The problem here is that i can't locate the error at all because i, myself reproduced the same thing i did with the front part, so i'm unsure where the error might be located and i would need someone to help me ðŸ˜­
