creations-chat 2022-05-08 23:38:16 Bro man of culture i would have prefered the classic sc1 ver.
creations-chat 2022-06-07 12:28:26 Huh that Ferdinand is good wdym its bad. Also you gotta remember that Mechanisms are also good pretty Impressive that he Put a Rocket Accelerator that you Can aim not just there Its a Decently Good Build in General, Roscale..... How did this Kingtiger Get in HOF then, and dont tell me that It has more Detail but he kinda Did his best Trying to add Detail while Also adding the Pvp stuff in General....
creations-chat 2022-06-07 12:36:44 Rivets, Angle locked Roof, More Detailed Muzzle than this and Transitions better from barrel to Muzzle, The gun Port could have been done better, He managed to Make the Gun to Move Amazingly and Its good in Pvp, Other than that Idk what to say , Im not saying the King Tiger is bad its actually pretty Good  but, Saying that its Shit that it isnt Roscaled and Crap is what Im saying not that The Kingtiger didnt deserve Hall of Fame the Camo is Amazing. I would have been able to do that since Im a Lazy ####
creations-chat 2022-06-07 12:56:32 you cant compete with a all design tank with the tiger 2 Im just Trying to even it out.

creations-chat 2022-06-07 13:09:28 This Angle is Very Detailed (Not saying this One Angle is Better than the Whole Tiger Tbh to give the Tiger 2 Credit i Tried that Turret more than 6 times i cant get it right.) is this just me or is the turret slightly too big on the tiger 2)
