bug-reports 2023-04-04 07:44:58 i also have that issue but idk how to fix
bug-reports 2023-04-04 07:45:07 its made basically all my aircraft unflyable
bug-reports 2023-04-04 07:46:39 the motors work fine on the ground
bug-reports 2023-04-04 07:46:46 but the moment i get into the air, they just break
bug-reports 2023-04-04 16:41:02 So is it fixed or not?
