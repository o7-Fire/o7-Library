creations-chat 2021-12-06 22:12:39 Explosive reactive armour (ERA) is a type of armour that is used in modern tanks and other armoured vehicles to protect them from projectiles that employ shaped charged warheads. An ERA is extremely effective on HEAT and HESH rounds. It also protects the vehicle from APFSDS rounds up to some extent. (google)
creations-chat 2021-12-06 22:14:57 technology is frickin amazing
creations-chat 2021-12-06 22:25:26 dang
creations-chat 2021-12-06 22:31:26 but yeah their ideas are good, maybe make some scattered wood flooring instead of just the dirt bottom

creations-chat 2021-12-06 22:39:53 Suggestions for features/refinements? (custom Futuristic Jet)
creations-chat 2021-12-06 23:45:11 Forwards or Backwards swept wings?
creations-chat 2021-12-06 23:49:30 depends on what?
creations-chat 2021-12-06 23:55:28 like relatively near future, 2050-2100 I guess. Here are the wing designs I have planned
creations-chat 2021-12-07 00:00:38 It looks pretty good, tho maybe just use signs instead of the firework things
creations-chat 2021-12-07 00:02:55 like one of these two?
creations-chat 2021-12-07 00:12:17 why'd you ping me?
creations-chat 2021-12-07 00:15:07 oh wait I read it wrong, I just assumed you were talking about your jet, But I consulted my friends and stuff they said the first backwards wing (The F-35 Delta looking one)
creations-chat 2021-12-07 00:42:49 <@!688806157749715044> it's actually kinda cool, good Idea

creations-chat 2021-12-18 04:35:28 <@!696537598687969311>  The F35 needs better wing shape and bigger engine, but otherwise it's decent

creations-chat 2021-12-19 19:58:17 I'm sorry, I barely know anything about this type of build. Maybe you could give me some pointers instead of just "Make it better" Now I know how the noobs on here feel when they present something they're proud of
creations-chat 2021-12-19 20:00:24 usually I have, and I've given it on many occasions.
help 2021-12-19 20:19:53 Hey does anyone know why my suspension is freaking out (making first car after 20 days of playtime of helicopters and planes) also sorry for trash frame rate, I have a pc that acts like it just drank lukewarm milk

creations-chat 2021-12-19 21:18:03 I honestly thought so too
creations-chat 2021-12-19 21:20:28 Should I keep the front shape?

bug-reports 2021-12-20 00:44:38 that happens sometimes and I think rickje knows about it, I'm not even sure if there's a plausible fix

help 2021-12-21 03:15:13 assuming these aren't supposed to be welded and I have to use something that will disrupt the landing gear? (sparklers)

creations-chat 2021-12-21 03:29:23 do you mean the winter camo looking one?
creations-chat 2021-12-21 03:34:23 alr cool, also your builds are fricking insane, way better than any of mine lol, Mine are good but I never have any good enough ideas that I can actually pull off. like my Sci FI fighter jet I posted a while back, it was good but body and especially nose lacked shape and detail
creations-chat 2021-12-21 03:41:34 alr thanks for the tip,
 also <@!447221768520859659> so true

creations-chat 2021-12-21 03:49:04 why
creations-chat 2021-12-21 04:20:58 other than the one block wide thing, It's pretty good, especially the exhaust!
creations-chat 2021-12-21 04:41:35 uh I don't think that's what he was saying lmao. but yes bigger wingspan also, but try to maybe do a longer body somehow?
creations-chat 2021-12-21 04:51:45 what are they for? the wings?
help 2021-12-21 04:53:33 HES SCAMMING IT'S dIscordnitroxyz

creations-chat 2021-12-21 04:57:04 oof. under instead? less noticable for pictures and you can hide it with someone else

help 2021-12-21 04:58:54 why should you not get banned?
help 2021-12-21 04:58:58 or at least kicked

help 2021-12-21 05:01:03 ok then
creations-chat 2021-12-21 05:01:51 yeah
creations-chat 2021-12-21 05:20:45 Mig-25 Foxbat
creations-chat 2021-12-21 05:26:26 I made a half wedgedown 1x10 jet nose for shits and giggles
creations-chat 2022-01-13 04:04:13 seriously though. Most good players are garbage humans without a life that spend their time on discord, insulting newer players builds and never giving actual feedback.
creations-chat 2022-01-13 04:06:16 holy shit that's hate speech. wow. sir, you, are the opitimy of pond scum.
creations-chat 2022-01-13 21:18:18 I think it's pretty much as good as you can get for plane crazy
creations-chat 2022-01-14 23:33:09 <@!647189712049537027> The nose is really off, the size of the engines are way too small, they're supposed to be in the middle, and finally, could have motorlocked a little and angle locked just a little to make a good engine. Plus landing gear is off
creations-chat 2022-01-14 23:35:16 What car do you plan on getting?
creations-chat 2022-01-14 23:41:11 Love the Celica, (When I'm old enough) I'm probably gonna get something off of Craigslist or offerup so I don't know what I'm gonna get, but definitely something FWD or AWD because I'm going to be doing a lot of adventuring (I'm a major rockhound and just love exploring)
creations-chat 2022-01-15 00:24:15 What the hell is this jet nose
bot-central 2022-01-15 01:40:39 !r
creations-chat 2022-01-16 04:59:42 This was supposed to be an attack heli at first but I think it's starting to look more like a jet, what do you guys think?
creations-chat 2022-01-16 05:04:31 I don't really know what I was going for, I saw a heli that looked sorta like that type of nose and didn't really think.
creations-chat 2022-01-16 05:06:35 The Ka-52 Alligator except I only saw the side view lmao
creations-chat 2022-01-17 00:22:03 Hows my jet coming along so far? It's a custom Cold War Era jet that's kind of a cross between the Phantom and the Foxbat
creations-chat 2022-01-17 00:25:43 do you know what both jets look like so you can say it looks good?
creations-chat 2022-01-17 01:10:47 it is pretty bad, it's like a N00b leaned how to do basic motorlock, maybe do some better cockpit and intake angles and it would look about a thousand times better.
creations-chat 2022-01-17 01:19:40 <@!601180053342257164> Like this crappy 15 minute jet I made, except maybe with an angle lock behind the cockpit.
creations-chat 2022-01-17 05:45:33 <@!548973346805776396> Holy- WOw it's amazing.
creations-chat 2022-01-17 16:20:11 I love how this channel is like 85% just memes lmao
creations-chat 2022-01-17 17:10:15 how's this for an Antarctic Supply/Transport plane body?
creations-chat 2022-01-17 19:26:11 congrats
help 2022-01-17 19:30:47 nice motorlock
help 2022-01-17 19:31:00 but the angles and stuff are just ass
creations-chat 2022-01-17 19:52:17 It's amazing. probably the most realistic build I've ever seen on this server!
creations-chat 2022-01-17 19:54:56 <@!359613171495075842> The Cannon is amazing, however would be cooler if it shot an actual projectile, that would be perfection.
creations-chat 2022-01-18 18:49:24 Wow I wish I was that popular
creations-chat 2022-01-18 20:19:24 the Vertical Stabilizer is way too small.  also <@!866848584888877077> your f16 looks stretched as hell but you took the nose from an F14 lmao
creations-chat 2022-01-18 21:37:05 Stabilizer is still a little small, either a block bigger or if that's too big then possibly use piston lock.
creations-chat 2022-01-18 21:42:11 If it has tilted tail fins like on the F22, they're called Stabilitors. if they're not, like on the F16..(Pretty impossible for a plane to only have one Stabilizer and it be tilted.) then it's a Stabilizer. Also Update on the Cold war Era Foxbat/Phantom Mix.
creations-chat 2022-01-18 23:29:10 At least you hid the gaps by motorlocking extra wing panels, but could you put the tiny bit of extra effort in to just make real Motor 2 control surfaces??
help 2022-01-19 00:36:13 why tho?
help 2022-01-19 00:39:11 use cylinders and piston lock them down to look like actual wheels. can't really make actual wheels if they're 1x1 cylinders.
creations-chat 2022-01-19 00:42:59 Finished the body, How's it looking? For those who haven't seen it's a Cold war era jet that's a cross between a Foxbat and a Phantom.
help 2022-01-19 00:45:37 yes please
help 2022-01-19 00:47:59 If you want to make it better, you can add ballast blocks to stabilize it. but otherwise you can reduce speed of propellers/angle of the thing that controls pitch.
help 2022-01-19 00:49:18 I know why you have to disconnectors, but I'm still not quite sure what you're trying to say.
creations-chat 2022-01-19 00:50:17 yeah..what he said lmao
help 2022-01-19 00:51:33 like I said, you can't make working, rolling wheels with a 1x1 cylinder.
help 2022-01-19 00:53:18 so you have to use propellers or you could use something else like that. you could try conveyors for no noise and then a speaker for the actual car noise if you wanted to.
help 2022-01-19 00:54:42 oof sorry, didn't think about that.
creations-chat 2022-01-19 01:49:30 Thanks you, the others just started an argument amongst themselves XD
creations-chat 2022-01-19 01:51:44 y tho
creations-chat 2022-01-19 01:53:46 idk fair point
creations-chat 2022-01-19 03:01:48 no, STOL stands for short take off an landing while VTOL is Vertical Take Off and Landing
creations-chat 2022-01-22 02:04:12 Hows my F-4 Successor going? not final paintjob obviously. gonna add elevons
creations-chat 2022-01-22 02:07:44 Well, you could at least do research and not off of memory, you got the cockpit shape all wrong
creations-chat 2022-01-22 02:10:56 So tilt 'em? or just have one? also <@!919835704077475851> Just move it forward, not that hard, and if you don't have space for that for whatever reason, add more motorlock towers.
creations-chat 2022-01-22 02:13:56 alright thanks. I'll test out some ideas once I detoxify. been playing for frickin ten hours straight.
creations-chat 2022-01-22 02:17:27 It's a successor, and I would have to redo the entire plane except the nose.
creations-chat 2022-01-22 02:25:18 I'd actually rather build custom things instead of making real planes or other things, especially because when I try to do a real build, unless it's wings, I usually fail miserably. And don't say practice or smthn because I have like 5 failed F18's in my saves that I need to delete, the only decent one I've made is an F15 lol
creations-chat 2022-01-22 02:31:10 OOOOF ROCKET FUEL GOT RECKD LMAO
<@!601183638461349898> Same with me, sometimes I set out to build something and my game doesn't like my motorlock
creations-chat 2022-01-22 02:33:12 Yeah because <@!458082343488454667>  Did some digging Thank you 🙏 🙏 🙏 🙏
creations-chat 2022-01-22 02:55:31 <@456226577798135808> Hey I think this looks pretty fine, more what you were thinking?
creations-chat 2022-01-22 02:58:55 Wow thank you, you seem to be a fairly well known and good person on here so that feels especially good coming from you. I also forgot to mention, ignore the cockpit the piston lock glitched.
creations-chat 2022-01-22 03:21:18 lmao no I didn't, shorter plus less blocks.
creations-chat 2022-01-23 15:52:55 Sir the first image had a lot more effort and overall looks better, even though it is not a plane. and if you look at the second image, well, looks very low effort compared to the first one. I upvoted both though lmao
creations-chat 2022-01-30 16:25:06 yep exactly what I was gonna say
creations-chat 2022-02-12 19:44:08 Put the cylinders that are sticking out the back into the engines. also instead of using motorlocked half wedge down 1x2 use control surfaces set to a keybind
creations-chat 2022-02-13 03:16:16 Mine was complete cancer? that's sad 😭
the-dump 2022-02-13 17:45:52 The backrooms has mean doggies

creations-chat 2022-02-13 19:01:35 <@!793087413526200381> 👌
creations-chat 2022-02-14 01:08:29 add an angled taper to the engines so there's not just a straight line at the back.
creations-chat 2022-02-14 01:10:47 also instead of a straight spine for a while and then a sudden  like 4 long angle, do a continual angle down into the back. But otherwise I love it
creations-chat 2022-02-14 01:28:56 
creations-chat 2022-02-14 01:44:49 trails and angle locked emoji text (piston lock most likely needed)

creations-chat 2022-02-14 21:23:56 Metro lock?
creations-chat 2022-02-14 21:26:34 I prefer "Mouhtehir lohcke"
creations-chat 2022-02-14 21:30:37 <@!840016197135237161> use motorlock to hide the monstrosity of a bottom plsu make WAY less angular with lots of angle lock. but for little to no motorlock it's good
creations-chat 2022-02-14 21:40:01 those aren't very good looking in my experience. <@!707973847324033025> I suggest just making the jet smaller.

creations-chat 2022-02-14 22:42:28 why using springs then
creations-chat 2022-02-14 22:47:30 how is that warnable? I've seen an entire disgusting fantasy as an about me 

<@!720751430595772418> I guess I just prefer tnt. springs have the incredible ability to get stuck inside your build and fuck it up, and tnt only cause temporary lag plus doesn't make a mess
creations-chat 2022-02-14 22:54:19 I'm not saying I should, I just thought it was fine considering the entirety of discord is 13+ (should be) and I'm pretty sure all thirteen year olds using discord know what the birds and the bees is. (somewhat of a social life) also I changed it. better?
creations-chat 2022-02-14 23:03:16 I actually did. 

<@!883063424614006878> Is it a problem for you that I prioritize playing and getting better at the game?
creations-chat 2022-02-14 23:07:28 I actually don't think I've really seen any of your builds. so no.

<@!375281006091173890> Give me a new pfp if mine is so bad
help 2022-02-14 23:11:39 Actually kinda hot. I can't form opinions on a single build, but if I had to I'd say we were on about the same skill level. tho the bit of exposed motorlock could probably be fixed
creations-chat 2022-02-14 23:12:31 That's an old ass build. I'm working on a build that is much better in my opinion.
help 2022-02-14 23:13:13 Smart indeed

creations-chat 2022-02-15 17:00:35 So hot 😩
help 2022-02-15 17:02:24 motorlock it down and have a disconnector for it.
creations-chat 2022-02-15 18:10:28 that is probably the weirdest plane I've seen on here. I was gonna give a suggestion but then I saw a top view. shorten the first part of the nose, make the cockpit less angular, and redo the intakes entirely
creations-chat 2022-02-15 18:17:06 that's hot
creations-chat 2022-02-15 18:47:01 yeah I don't think I could ever be any type of pioneer in plane crazy. y'all with these type of creations are determined and very persistent. I couldn't do that, whenever I encounter any problem I tend to quit. makes it very hard to finish builds.

creations-chat 2022-02-15 21:05:58 then just work it into details. maybe cargo made of sparklers or smthn to mostly hide it.
creations-chat 2022-02-15 21:08:05 that is a very motorlocked abomination. add sideways lock to do the wings. easy

creations-chat 2022-02-15 23:15:26 the blue super rocket looks shitty. make a custom blue burner, also use snow pipes. I personally like this afterburner
creations-chat 2022-02-15 23:17:46 why's that? just shove a snowpipe or two in the back.

<@!375281006091173890> That side view is hot
creations-chat 2022-02-15 23:20:01 just shove four snow pipes where the rockets are. Plus I'm pretty sure it will make it look better too

creations-chat 2022-02-22 23:40:06 Goddamn, one of the most realistic ones I've seen so far. The only thing I can think of, is make a slight angle on that front part
creations-chat 2022-02-22 23:50:31 needs a like 1x2 angle on the back part, so maybe piston lock the angle you have down, and add that angle?

creations-chat 2022-02-27 04:25:17 there's some things you can give feedback on. This, This is not one of those things. Also that very obviously has motorlock. Just make it better I'm pretty sure you know how to
creations-chat 2022-02-27 20:29:20 Yeah this kid is either an unde or a 40 year old. listening to Sad But True by Metallica <:empty:794431705070174238>
creations-chat 2022-02-27 20:31:24 Yep That sentence is literally made by and for ten year olds
creations-chat 2022-02-27 20:35:07 because Trains from the 19th century don't look like they're 21st century trains that got a paintjob made by a toddler.
creations-chat 2022-02-27 20:37:30 It's not toxicity, just what it looks like. This is an 1870's union pacific. make it look like this
creations-chat 2022-02-27 20:39:36 Still blocky as hell
creations-chat 2022-02-27 20:56:12 hide the lock (very easy) wings too thin, the build is flat as a pancake, angles WAY off. make the intake and shape of engines better (for example, angle lock the intake points to make it rounder.), and stabilators are too big. fix 3/5 or more and I might give an upvote.

<@!747564313597837432> Better Than your shitty builds <:OmegaTroll:626841385118597152>
creations-chat 2022-02-28 19:10:14 The intakes are bad but could we get a top view?
creations-chat 2022-02-28 19:12:38 Ok hanks. Honestly, it's pretty good for first motorlocked build
creations-chat 2022-02-28 19:23:09 move the half wedge 1x2 down's to the front, fix the elevons so they have a better shape and are more inside the build, the vertical Stabs are too close together and should be motorlocked further apart, and the spine (part behind the canopy) tapers too quickly. otherwise it's good, better than my first motorlocked build!
creations-chat 2022-02-28 19:26:57 <@!652190076222046249> I love it, but the reason I gave it a downvote, the back, make custom nozzles and custom afterburners, and make it shorter, the back extends beyond the elevons so it looks ugly. Also the Vertical stabs look garbage. fix those and I'll give upvote
creations-chat 2022-02-28 19:29:22 it's a fat plane <:trollface:775024642104229898>

creations-chat 2022-02-28 23:25:44 I love the intake tho if possible, could be a little less tall.
help 2022-02-28 23:40:08 it's hard to explain, but if there's obstructions, for example if you have two motors in top of eachother in a tower like fashion and have two vertically placed blocks touching both towers, they won't motorlock

creations-chat 2022-03-08 00:00:26 <@!594977389096730627> I gave downvote because;
1. way too much exposed lock, especially that entire tower near the cockpit, it's too choppy.
2. the angle lock on the spine needs to have piston lock.
3. the belly shouldn't just be blocky like that. 
4. It should have angle lock, and default engines instead of custom which look kinda bad. 
and it needs more detail pls
creations-chat 2022-03-08 00:08:33 The spine. If you fixed that and gave it good looking engines fit for space travel, I would give upvote.

creations-chat 2022-03-28 01:38:00 Well, unless you want to spend like 12 hours making it super realistic, the only angle lock I could suggest it the front, using blocks, and Half cylinders, you want to angle lock it so it's smoother. also top cockpit needs to be wider.
creations-chat 2022-03-28 01:40:32 Does <@!899267494873821194> 's build count as low effort?

creations-chat 2022-04-05 19:33:18 it's too thick now, plus behind the wings should still be thick.

bot-central 2022-04-06 02:54:47 -servers
creations-chat 2022-04-06 15:46:32 So you can't do custom control panels or at least hide the gap? Hiding the gap I think would be pretty easy, just lock a layer of wings onto the plane to hide them?
creations-chat 2022-04-06 15:54:35 The surface you have one it right now is a custom control panel?
creations-chat 2022-04-06 16:25:49 Ok well it looks like a regular control panel, maybe you could piston lock a wing so it covers at least most of the gap?
creations-chat 2022-04-06 16:34:03 Ok well awesome creation either way
creations-chat 2022-04-06 16:38:22 yeah that gap was pretty much my only feedback, otherwise it's pretty much perfect for plane crazy, tho If I made a version of that I would probably spend more time on making the fuselage rounder, but it's all up to you lol
creations-chat 2022-04-06 18:22:18 it's fucking annoying, you build a lot slower, but it doesn't really affect your skill

creations-chat 2022-04-13 19:15:10 Hows this for Mirage 2000C nose? (This is actually to scale so stfu)
creations-chat 2022-04-13 19:17:52 I don't like building planes bigger than their actual size it feels wrong. I have major OCD so it's weird
creations-chat 2022-04-13 19:19:37 Ok look at the actual scale of the Mirage 2k. look it up, and educate yourselves before you spout wrong information.
creations-chat 2022-04-13 19:21:32 Is this better?
creations-chat 2022-04-13 19:24:42 This is better then?
creations-chat 2022-04-13 19:27:07 Then the nose isn't accurate length or angle tho
creations-chat 2022-04-13 19:29:58 All well built and accurate mirages have a nose like mine
creations-chat 2022-04-13 19:33:38 Mine is pretty damn accurate right now

creations-chat 2022-04-13 21:40:36 ok look it up and tell me the scale, if you know so much
creations-chat 2022-04-13 21:43:25 Roblo characters have a wide Height-Width ratio. tho if I equip Rthro, it's more accurate. 1 block is the closest I can get it
creations-chat 2022-04-13 21:45:55 I could make it nice looking if it was bigger, that's true, but I swear to fucking God would you like to look up the dimensions of the Mirage 2000C? It's a small plane you uneducated fucks
creations-chat 2022-04-13 21:47:39 yeah but it's like 2x actual scale, plus looks shit
creations-chat 2022-04-13 21:50:19 Please just look up the scale on it. Yes normal jets are two wide for roscale, but the Mirage 2000C is a small fucking plane

creations-chat 2022-04-19 20:27:08 And...?
creations-chat 2022-04-19 20:28:53 Please, Look the damn dimensions up. 

Thanks, Cylinder Canopy? Alright I'll try. Already running out of space though lmao
creations-chat 2022-04-19 20:31:49 How wide is it then?
creations-chat 2022-04-19 20:38:21 Weird. I take a block as a meter and it's 15 blocks long. It's 50' in real life which equates to 15 metres, and the wingspan is 9 metres. so, it should be to scale.
creations-chat 2022-04-19 20:41:49 Yeah that's fair. will take into consideration for my next build, already gone too far on this one lmao
creations-chat 2022-04-19 20:44:32 Looks really good, especially the nose. just needs more detail

creations-chat 2022-04-19 23:30:19 can't do that sadly. I do have 1x4 delta wings though, .075 blocks sticking out of the side. 

<@526422085875007498> Roblox characters have a much wider height:width ratio than humans. I've equipped rthro in the past to show. can't right now. not on my pc
creations-chat 2022-04-19 23:32:02 15 blocks. (15 metres, which is 50 feet for the uneducated entirety of this discord server. The length of the mirage irl)
creations-chat 2022-04-19 23:35:06 are they two meters? are roblox characters 12'8??
creations-chat 2022-04-19 23:38:41 Ok good to know, will take that into consideration next time I build a mirage. Probably not for a while, it's been torture with fitting the motorlock inside the plane
creations-chat 2022-04-19 23:40:25 holy fucking shit it's so bad
creations-chat 2022-04-19 23:45:12 yeah but nobody uses that because then my mirage would have to be 101 blocks long lmao

creations-chat 2022-05-09 18:19:47 There's not a lot of Jets that are supposed to be one block wide, but the ones that are, The roblox character has a wide height-width ratio, use rthro for better proportions 👍

creations-chat 2022-05-09 18:31:28 look at the height-width ratio of a roblox character vs the height to width ratio of a human. I've equipped rthro to show it before
creations-chat 2022-05-09 18:33:10 Not in Plane crazy, it's always the same height and width in plane crazy, except rthro.
creations-chat 2022-05-09 18:36:48 Okay, so, I'm 5'6 irl 13" wide, that would mean I have a 5:1 height-width ratio, roblox characters are one block wide and two blocks tall, meaning they have a 2:1 height-width ratio
