creations-chat 2022-03-10 23:37:06 nice
creations-chat 2022-05-02 11:55:24 what's so bad about my build
creations-chat 2022-05-02 11:57:06 is it the exposed motors?
creations-chat 2022-05-18 18:17:57 so good
creations-chat 2022-05-18 18:22:25 why? because I am a good builder???
creations-chat 2022-05-18 18:24:29 jelous
creations-chat 2022-05-18 18:28:07 lol
creations-chat 2022-05-18 18:37:43 this build has been my most vote don build
creations-chat 2022-05-18 18:57:39 yes
creations-chat 2022-05-18 19:28:54 Someone called my newest jet a namnam jet ðŸ˜¦
creations-chat 2022-05-18 19:30:52 do you agree it is like a namnam jet though?
creations-chat 2022-05-18 20:57:59 im gonna make the UwU plane look better

Not good, but not UwU
creations-chat 2022-05-18 21:03:11 why. I am getting rid of the UwU
creations-chat 2022-05-18 21:27:43 I just realized that since I added trapdoors now when I join a server everyone will call me a namnam tut when I am not instead of just 1 person.
creations-chat 2022-05-18 21:30:16 why?
creations-chat 2022-05-18 21:43:41 let's get me to 100 downvotes
creations-chat 2022-05-19 01:31:30 lol
creations-chat 2022-05-19 02:00:53 at least the thing works
creations-chat 2022-05-19 02:12:49 it works pretty well actually. I killed like 15 things in it. Mainly tanks but also an a10, a few bombers, and a few ww2 planes.
creations-chat 2022-05-19 02:14:31 mostly yes. And after every kill I said "UwU" in chat
creations-chat 2022-05-19 19:48:27 It is a

f**k this sucks and took 
16 hours to make
the-dump 2022-05-19 19:52:04 lol
creations-chat 2022-05-20 00:57:01 it wasn't originally an f16
creations-chat 2022-05-20 01:00:30 I would rather have a trash f16 than an UwU plane. At least the f16 doesn't make you want to commit self oof on sight
creations-chat 2022-05-20 01:03:45 It got 1 engine thing in the back and 1 vertical stabilizer. basically an f16

And it was built with no references in way to short of time. Close enough for me considering the circumstance

If I started making an f16 from the start [and planned it out] it would be better
creations-chat 2022-05-20 01:07:10 All of these are because the plane wasn't really starting as an f-16 and I wanted to finish the built and not waste time on it.

Also, the first point is wrong, my plane has no intakes
creations-chat 2022-05-20 01:09:17 I get more downvotes calling it an f16. Less downvotes than UwU  though ðŸ˜¦
creations-chat 2022-05-20 01:11:11 im gonna take a shower now.
creations-chat 2022-05-20 01:59:21 it is what it is
creations-chat 2022-05-20 02:41:19 <@472553877711880211> nice plane
creations-chat 2022-05-20 04:31:19 Proof UwU plane is used for toxicity ||Channel is an alt account ||

creations-chat 2022-05-20 04:33:14 I am a menace to society. Please end my suffering. I don't want to live any longer

creations-chat 2022-05-23 15:50:26 I don't flood it and I post them for feedback
creations-chat 2022-05-23 15:53:23 Don't post creations because they suck isn't criticism
creations-chat 2022-05-23 15:57:32 Someone said my wings were straight [Not you if I remember correctly. You said one of my build from months ago was ugly and I simply responded that it was an old build. I didn't essentially say "â€˜i know suck, but i try best"
creations-chat 2022-05-23 23:37:31 I found a way to make this shape
creations-chat 2022-05-23 23:40:02 I am so proud of my discovery. Now I can make more complex builds. ðŸ™‚  ðŸ™‚ ðŸ™‚ ðŸ™‚

creations-chat 2022-05-25 02:18:10 im no longer a white name
creations-chat 2022-05-25 02:21:11 I like it
help 2022-07-28 02:34:26 <@155149108183695360> keeps saying to stop spamming whenever I try to post something in <#384025409945337856>
help 2022-07-28 02:38:40 It is a lot of text but not that much. I tried shortening it but it still wont work
help 2022-07-28 02:38:44 what is the limit?

creations-chat 2022-07-30 04:17:02 I like the look of everything being exposed  :l
||[Not on a normal plane where it just isn't hidden of course]||
creations-chat 2022-07-30 04:19:51 oof
creations-chat 2022-07-30 04:22:13 yes
creations-chat 2022-07-30 15:16:17 My latest build is literally white. Bright white...

||[Also, build is very unoriginal]||
creations-chat 2022-07-31 13:35:54 yes
I literally said "totally original build"
creations-chat 2022-07-31 13:37:57 The back part is also taken from something else
creations-chat 2022-07-31 13:43:36 the color scheme is from a real ice-cream truck where I live
creations-chat 2022-07-31 13:51:01 Chill bruh. I literally said it was copied...
creations-chat 2022-07-31 13:54:27 die.
creations-chat 2022-07-31 16:16:20 still before you pinged me though. The message was edited within like 1-2 minutes
creations-chat 2022-07-31 16:19:02 I honestly just wanted to see what people would say

creations-chat 2022-08-06 22:37:40 Not at max speed because it takes to long to excelerate
creations-chat 2022-08-06 22:39:42 here is a video to show you the acceleration https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp9fXbQIj9s
creations-chat 2022-08-06 22:41:48 A few questions

can I see it?

Does it wobble?

Does it go straight?
creations-chat 2022-08-06 22:45:33 if something really goes over 1 million speed and not because the game glitches out I don't care what it is like. I will not be disappointed
creations-chat 2022-08-06 22:47:44 LOL

Ill put the images here for others to see
creations-chat 2022-08-06 22:52:46 It looks like a tall and reskinned namnam jet.....

My best guess with the issue is some weird glitch with the motorlocking
creations-chat 2022-08-06 23:24:07 <@474612151798202378> The build is ok but that color scheme **NEEDS** to be changed
creations-chat 2022-08-06 23:26:10 ........
Ight. I'll change my vote
creations-chat 2022-08-06 23:58:07 https://streamable.com/19i3dx I made my plane faster by adding more hover thrusters
creations-chat 2022-08-07 02:13:07 thanks for the tip
creations-chat 2022-08-07 14:33:39 it can go straight forward, or straight up. When it goes forward it does not change in altitude

creations-chat 2022-11-13 02:14:36 I don't even know anymore. I haven't even been playing that long and it is drastically worse than when I started
creations-chat 2022-11-15 01:19:57 .....
creations-chat 2022-11-15 01:22:19 You got downvotes because of your attitude in the post.  Stop talking about the alt thing, stop talking about the white name thing, and stop talking about how much effort you put in or how much you tried. Nobody cares and nobody asked. Just show us the build and maybe a funny caption
creations-chat 2022-11-15 01:24:27 bruh. you did all this stuff in **this** post.......
creations-chat 2022-11-15 01:34:42 who gave me expert????.......
creations-chat 2022-11-15 01:36:58 I got it from this...
creations-chat 2022-11-15 01:39:03 Not a serious build
creations-chat 2022-11-15 01:41:16 Expert 5 should be at least 200+ upvotes in my opinion.
creations-chat 2022-11-19 23:23:08 the bot wont work
creations-chat 2022-11-20 01:04:37 Why downvote, besides one block wide build
creations-chat 2022-11-20 01:10:27 <@680160977052106769> they are in-game (I normally use a version without them though)

creations-chat 2022-11-20 01:33:40 don't worry about downvotes

creations-chat 2022-11-20 22:53:03 I object to the idea of planes having spines
creations-chat 2022-11-20 23:11:02 cool
creations-chat 2022-11-21 00:04:39 Facts
creations-chat 2022-11-23 19:36:10 <@860154094072102923> I also build in a one wide-pvp jet style and what you made is literally a namnam....At least change it up a bit bro
