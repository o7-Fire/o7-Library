creations-chat 2020-10-10 18:45:09 > but why dislike ;c
<@!644760869519097896>  the wings are size accurate to the cockpit, it isn‚Äôt painted, and the cockpit itself looks messy. Fix all of that and you‚Äôll probably get more approval
creations-chat 2020-10-10 18:45:28 Look at an a-10 and give it more detail
creations-chat 2020-10-10 18:46:03 That a-10 you built doesn‚Äôt have a lot of detail, give it a nice paint job tooüëç
creations-chat 2020-10-10 18:47:04 Looking at it more closely it looks like Pointy‚Äôs tutorial
creations-chat 2020-10-10 18:47:21 The wings look like his tutorial
creations-chat 2020-10-10 18:47:37 The engines don‚Äôt tho
creations-chat 2020-10-10 18:48:43 <@!644760869519097896> you seem new. When you submit creations give them a nice paint job. And give it accurate detail. If it doesn‚Äôt look 90% like an a-10, it isn‚Äôt an a-10
creations-chat 2020-10-10 18:49:01 Pointy is a youtuber
creations-chat 2020-10-10 18:49:42 That‚Äôs ban worthy?

creations-chat 2020-10-10 21:38:23 Isn‚Äôt that a tutorial
creations-chat 2020-10-10 21:38:39 That is a tutorial
creations-chat 2020-10-10 21:39:31 The feedback is that it was a decent designed tutorial, and that anything added to it would still make it a tutorial

<@456226577798135808> crop your images. I use both mobile and mac and i always have to remember to crop.
creations-chat 2020-10-11 06:52:03 <@456226577798135808> also fix the fuselage and give it better detail
creations-chat 2020-10-11 06:53:03 the fuselage is a bit thick toward the front
creations-chat 2020-10-11 06:53:19 maybe take in down a half block
creations-chat 2020-10-11 06:53:45 both the intakes and the fuselage
creations-chat 2020-10-11 06:54:05 **both**
creations-chat 2020-10-11 06:54:46 the fuselage is the body, intakes are intakes
creations-chat 2020-10-11 06:55:32 wdym circles
creations-chat 2020-10-11 06:56:43 <@!673397945764151336> compare and contrast your mig-31 to this pic

creations-chat 2020-10-11 06:58:50 ohh youve got a lot of work to do. start by making the cockpit longer
creations-chat 2020-10-11 06:59:25 when designing always have a template
creations-chat 2020-10-11 06:59:41 that image earlier use it to adjust the dimensions of the build
creations-chat 2020-10-11 07:00:15 correct
creations-chat 2020-10-11 07:00:53 give it better detail, make the fuselage smoother, and the wings neater
creations-chat 2020-10-11 07:01:43 if it doesnt look smooth, dont post it
creations-chat 2020-10-11 07:02:00 and crop the imagine for some reason mobile players have a bad rep
creations-chat 2020-10-11 07:02:55 whats that
creations-chat 2020-10-11 07:03:50 yeah dude you need to make that smoother
creations-chat 2020-10-11 07:04:38 cannopy does not match the size of the wings, the body is too short by about 3 blocks, the elevators dont look design accurate
creations-chat 2020-10-11 07:05:15 revise the whole build
creations-chat 2020-10-11 07:05:35 motor lock isnt for everyone
creations-chat 2020-10-11 07:06:20 fix the back. In order for the build to match the you have to fix the body
creations-chat 2020-10-11 07:06:57 look at the f-16 pic you posted, and use delta wings to try to make the shape
creations-chat 2020-10-11 07:09:38 use 1x2 for the wings, and 1x2 and or 1x1 jointly for the elevators

creations-chat 2020-10-11 07:21:04 look at the picture, add some conveyors
creations-chat 2020-10-11 07:21:50 ladders, wing trails, and wing lights add a lot of detail

creations-chat 2020-10-12 00:11:11 The angles r off, you have to make it wider and longer. Maybe add some guns, rockets too. Maybe buy a house, start a family, settle down. Then it will look right
creations-chat 2020-10-12 09:01:33 Crop your image next time
creations-chat 2020-10-12 09:03:02 Nah it‚Äôs fine. if you want the full view close the chat a make sure to place all the buttons neatly in one area, away from the build. That way you can crop the image without including the buttons

creations-chat 2020-10-12 09:08:50 Wings and elevators seem to be in the right position. However the fuselage(body) needs to be moved up by 2 blocks
creations-chat 2020-10-12 09:09:58 So move the intakes and cockpit up two blocks

creations-chat 2020-10-29 02:07:01 Does anyone have a fighter jet with gray digital camo, if so can you share a pic. I'm trying to make some digital camo and need inspiration.
creations-chat 2020-10-29 02:08:39 > <@!456137975894507521> bruh digital camo is easy mainly bc EVERYTHING IS BLOCKS
<@!658829907110920192> it gets hard because all my blocks are compressed. So adding color to each individual block and wing panel will make the colors look glitchy. :/
creations-chat 2020-10-29 02:14:38 > yea <@!456137975894507521> but its kinda old
<@!655236433501618180> it's fine. I'll find it useful in some way
creations-chat 2020-10-30 02:07:21 you dont post someone else's creation in a chat where you get upvoted and downvoted, and get ranked based off the creation you submit. There is a thing called <#504436696021204992> <#384021699466756107>
creations-chat 2020-10-30 02:14:34 Yes i agree. It is wrong if you post something that isnt yours, without the builders consent. And two, it does spin using motors

creations-chat 2020-11-03 16:29:03 <@!489910972946055172> posting reference pictures distract the build. If it is "necessary" to include a reference picture within the picture, that obviously means that you didnt put enough time and effort into it. Secondly, you started to post the same message and picture over again which is annoying

creations-chat 2021-04-21 00:16:46 Destroyers nose is longer. Intakes more inward in the wings. Wings are more angular. The dudes camo is similar to destroyers though. But destroyer has defining differences.
creations-chat 2021-04-21 00:21:34 Be careful when making copier accusations. Study the build to insure if it‚Äôs a certain copy or not. I don‚Äôt know for sure if the dude copied or not, I‚Äôm just saying study the details and be careful.

creations-chat 2021-05-07 01:38:14 Aren‚Äôt you allowed to post wips if your build is nearly done and you want it to be graded before it is finished?

I know but I‚Äôm saying in general there are exceptions to the wip rule. I agree half the plane wasn‚Äôt finished though.
creations-chat 2021-05-07 14:06:28 Wrong person
creations-chat 2021-05-07 14:12:25 I really don‚Äôt understand this wip rule ecksdee
creations-chat 2021-05-07 15:02:17 ._. I know that. 
I don‚Äôt understand how when someone post a build that is relatively done, but not finalized, people say that it needs to be taken down. I understand the fuss when someone post the nose of their plane that isn‚Äôt even done.
creations-chat 2021-05-07 15:09:31 These disparities in the wip rule are puzzling.
creations-chat 2021-05-07 15:17:03 I get what you‚Äôre saying. But I‚Äôve seen people post builds that are basically done with wip in the title and there hasn‚Äôt been any fuss.
creations-chat 2021-05-07 15:21:31 You‚Äôre right. I guess it‚Äôs just like that. It isn‚Äôt completely right but it‚Äôs the way it is.
