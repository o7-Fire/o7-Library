creations-chat 2020-08-13 16:19:04 you're using discord on your phone aren't you

creations-chat 2020-08-13 16:20:12 how is a high capacity bomber bad just because it looks bad
creations-chat 2020-08-13 16:20:49 anyways i usually just flush looks down the toilet
creations-chat 2020-08-13 16:21:38 meh

creations-chat 2020-08-28 16:30:49 most my recent pics were taken in pvp
creations-chat 2020-08-28 16:30:56 (noone cares gg)
creations-chat 2020-08-30 15:46:32 still needs some refinement
creations-chat 2020-08-30 15:48:13 better now? what do you think?
creations-chat 2020-08-30 15:49:37 well i am trying to seek opinions over this Aero-45
creations-chat 2020-08-30 15:49:46 its REALLY hard to do at the scale i am building it.
creations-chat 2020-08-30 15:56:21 guess seaking opinions and feedback is useless because everyones judging based off a biased opinion
creations-chat 2020-08-30 15:56:49 if i did that every pic i saw i would dislike instantly.
creations-chat 2020-08-30 15:59:35 i was trying to ask opinions about the front
creations-chat 2020-08-30 15:59:46 this plane is so darn hard to build
creations-chat 2020-08-30 15:59:48 like legit
creations-chat 2020-08-30 16:00:02 its taken me like 15 mins already
creations-chat 2020-08-30 16:00:21 Aero-45
creations-chat 2020-08-30 16:00:46 czechoslovak mail delivery and joyrides plane
creations-chat 2020-08-30 16:01:47 nah
creations-chat 2020-08-30 16:02:17 originally i asked the guy in <#497142796961054721> to vote over the Aero-45 and Me 108 Taifun
creations-chat 2020-08-30 16:02:22 they said Aero
creations-chat 2020-08-30 16:02:37 i probly should have tried the Me 108
creations-chat 2020-08-30 16:03:49 is it a problem if i send in a pic of both
creations-chat 2020-08-30 16:04:27 maybe this channel
creations-chat 2020-08-30 16:04:32 dont think that would work but maybe
creations-chat 2020-08-30 16:04:45 anyways imma try the 108 then
creations-chat 2020-08-30 16:05:13 bf 108
creations-chat 2020-08-30 16:05:15 SO EZ
creations-chat 2020-08-30 16:05:19 its like a bf 109
creations-chat 2020-08-30 16:05:28 but its a tourist and mail delivery plane
creations-chat 2020-08-30 16:05:37 that is literally the 109's big older bro
creations-chat 2020-08-30 16:06:32 its not a bf 109
creations-chat 2020-08-30 16:06:36 its a bf 108
creations-chat 2020-08-30 16:06:41 oh.
creations-chat 2020-08-30 16:06:50 well, the differences are that the
creations-chat 2020-08-30 16:07:05 108 can fit 3 people pilot not included in that number
creations-chat 2020-08-30 16:07:10 its slower.
creations-chat 2020-08-30 16:07:35 also it was manufactured in france after the war
creations-chat 2020-08-30 16:07:48 and used by them until the late 60s
creations-chat 2020-08-30 16:08:58 im not that skilled.
creations-chat 2020-08-30 16:09:07 i have built like a decent number of stuff but
creations-chat 2020-08-30 16:09:16 never above the roblox character size scale
creations-chat 2020-08-30 16:09:22 (which i take as a basis)
creations-chat 2020-08-30 16:11:37 can i ask a question
creations-chat 2020-08-30 16:11:48 does leaving a block distance between seats worth it
creations-chat 2020-08-30 16:11:54 in like TINY builds?
creations-chat 2020-08-30 16:12:09 does look better or is more space worth it
creations-chat 2020-08-30 16:12:18 austetic or more space
creations-chat 2020-08-30 16:12:20 okay.
creations-chat 2020-08-30 16:12:30 ill build the cabin of the 108 that way then.
creations-chat 2020-08-30 16:13:05 im about to be a big brain
creations-chat 2020-08-30 16:13:19 im gonna use signs instead of half blocks
creations-chat 2020-08-30 16:13:27 harder to use but look more realistic
creations-chat 2020-08-30 16:13:41 also allows me to leave hidden stuff
creations-chat 2020-08-30 16:15:07 im putting funny quotes onto the sides
creations-chat 2020-08-30 16:15:09 like

creations-chat 2020-08-30 17:27:24 if that isn't enough
creations-chat 2020-08-30 17:27:31 i have more i believe
creations-chat 2020-08-30 17:27:41 aircraft that are next to inpossible to make
creations-chat 2020-08-30 17:27:49 for example i tried to make the Aero-45
creations-chat 2020-08-30 17:28:00 its a czechoslovak twin-engine passenger plane
creations-chat 2020-08-30 17:28:30 
creations-chat 2020-08-30 17:29:14 or try to make
creations-chat 2020-08-30 17:29:17 a...
creations-chat 2020-08-30 17:30:08 Try 2 build 1 of these
creations-chat 2020-08-30 17:30:29 
creations-chat 2020-08-30 17:30:37 here are some moar anglez
creations-chat 2020-08-30 17:31:06 also if you look at the tails and fuselages you may see something weird
creations-chat 2020-08-30 17:31:36 for example the second latest pic i posted
creations-chat 2020-08-30 17:31:42 you can't read the writing
creations-chat 2020-08-30 17:31:45 can you
creations-chat 2020-08-30 17:32:08 wdym
creations-chat 2020-08-30 17:32:40 oh
creations-chat 2020-08-30 17:32:53 thought about the way prop blades are angled
creations-chat 2020-08-30 17:33:01 but thats gotta be obvius
creations-chat 2020-08-30 17:33:11 btw i made a Bf 108
creations-chat 2020-08-30 17:33:20 doesn't look the best but for what tech i used
creations-chat 2020-08-30 17:33:31 it looks quite realistic in my op
creations-chat 2020-08-30 17:33:41 
creations-chat 2020-08-30 17:33:53 from this angle its a bit weird i can imagine
creations-chat 2020-08-30 17:34:08 but in game it looks way better
creations-chat 2020-08-30 17:34:19 like everything else does
creations-chat 2020-08-30 17:34:41 i used signs for the passenger cabin parts
creations-chat 2020-08-30 17:34:51 and half slabs to attach wings
creations-chat 2020-08-30 17:35:02 however i made the wing look a bit weird
creations-chat 2020-08-30 17:35:21 because there isn't a solid block between the wing and the passenger seats
creations-chat 2020-08-30 17:35:27 meaning theres a hole
creations-chat 2020-08-30 17:35:44 > The 108 is long
<@!393679134779375616> there isn't a 1x7 wedge sadly
creations-chat 2020-08-30 17:35:56 although i wish there was
creations-chat 2020-08-30 17:36:09 nor 1x7 triangle wedges
creations-chat 2020-08-30 17:36:23 seriusly these 1x1 1x2 1x3 1x4 wedges aren't enough are they
creations-chat 2020-08-30 17:36:42 dry
creations-chat 2020-08-30 17:36:48 that plane is VERY small.
creations-chat 2020-08-30 17:36:54 despite how big it looks in the pic.
creations-chat 2020-08-30 17:37:04 the fuselage is just 3 blocks wide
creations-chat 2020-08-30 17:37:24 unlike maybe my F-13 that has a width of 5 blocks at the passenger compartment
creations-chat 2020-08-30 17:37:50 3 block wide?
creations-chat 2020-08-30 17:37:58 INCLUDING THE WINGS?
creations-chat 2020-08-30 17:38:07 i was talking about the fuselage
creations-chat 2020-08-30 17:38:14 otherwise if you include wingspan
creations-chat 2020-08-30 17:38:19 its about 11 blocks or so
creations-chat 2020-08-30 17:38:32 so its quite a wide one
creations-chat 2020-08-30 17:38:50 well
creations-chat 2020-08-30 17:38:58 at the size of the plane i got
creations-chat 2020-08-30 17:39:18 i probly won't be able to do any of those building hax that u can do in bigger builds
creations-chat 2020-08-30 17:39:29 like maybe the tutorial P40 as an example
creations-chat 2020-08-30 17:39:43 i wanted to not use rockets here
creations-chat 2020-08-30 17:39:56 otherwise it uses a 3 blade radial
creations-chat 2020-08-30 17:40:04 because the 2 blade wasn't powerful enough
creations-chat 2020-08-30 17:40:13 and there isn't an in-line engine in the game.
creations-chat 2020-08-30 17:40:28 davreen, i like that ship in the background too
creations-chat 2020-08-30 17:41:48 that bf 108 isn't large at all
creations-chat 2020-08-30 17:41:59 
creations-chat 2020-08-30 17:42:03 
creations-chat 2020-08-30 17:42:10 like legit
creations-chat 2020-08-30 17:42:14 its so smol
creations-chat 2020-08-30 17:42:27 it does a meezly 180
creations-chat 2020-08-30 17:42:32 and turns actually quite well
creations-chat 2020-08-30 17:58:58 ive made some changes
creations-chat 2020-08-30 17:59:08 
creations-chat 2020-08-30 17:59:12 how does it look? still pretty bad i believe
creations-chat 2020-08-30 17:59:38 bf 108 copycat
creations-chat 2020-08-30 18:00:07 yea the long nose is a good point ngl
creations-chat 2020-08-30 18:00:25 well
creations-chat 2020-08-30 18:00:30 if you look at it sideways
creations-chat 2020-08-30 18:00:36 it makes it a bit flatter
creations-chat 2020-08-30 18:00:57 
creations-chat 2020-08-30 18:02:14 any nein lives jokes?
creations-chat 2020-08-30 18:03:12 
creations-chat 2020-08-30 18:03:18 smol update, bit shorter nose now
creations-chat 2020-08-30 18:04:21 well, shorter nose now.
creations-chat 2020-08-30 18:04:37 why would someone do that
creations-chat 2020-08-30 18:04:48 i don't see a point
creations-chat 2020-08-30 18:05:02 well, i have a Pe-8
creations-chat 2020-08-30 18:05:07 isn't the prettiest
creations-chat 2020-08-30 18:05:13 but it works?
creations-chat 2020-08-30 18:05:16 i guess
creations-chat 2020-08-30 18:05:32 it can carry 7 bombs that are mounted in a line
creations-chat 2020-08-30 18:05:44 my Pe-8's features:
creations-chat 2020-08-30 18:06:27 8 bombs, only props, the ability to fly as slow as hell, 4 self-defense MGs (COMPLETELY USELESS), a non-realistic camo i designed
creations-chat 2020-08-30 18:06:34 and 'flaps'
creations-chat 2020-08-30 18:07:19 
creations-chat 2020-08-30 18:07:22 heres that Pe-8 of mine
creations-chat 2020-08-30 18:07:26 guys
creations-chat 2020-08-30 18:07:33 is it an issue if i self-downvote?
creations-chat 2020-08-30 18:08:33 well, i mainly build my planes to the scale of the roblox character, so i can't really fit anything large into them.
creations-chat 2020-08-30 18:08:43 still can be pretty cool tho.
creations-chat 2020-08-30 18:08:49 for example that F-13
creations-chat 2020-08-30 18:09:46 commit Junkers-F13
creations-chat 2020-08-30 18:10:03 looks bad does it
creations-chat 2020-08-30 18:10:38 because i can't build them to look so detailed
creations-chat 2020-08-30 18:10:44 like i can in Scrap Mechanic!

creations-chat 2020-08-30 18:20:02 if i sent in-game pics, that would take literal AGES.
creations-chat 2020-08-30 18:20:24 this one is meant to be a Ju 87
creations-chat 2020-08-30 18:20:30 its pretty cursed tho too.
creations-chat 2020-08-30 18:21:07 one issue i can't CTRL+V the links in
creations-chat 2020-08-30 18:22:10 guess ill use my phone then instead

creations-chat 2020-08-30 18:29:06 here comes the first 3
creations-chat 2020-08-30 18:29:14 
creations-chat 2020-08-30 18:29:22 the first plane i downloaded was the one at the top
creations-chat 2020-08-30 18:29:54 what i did was downloaded a Ju 87, then modified it so suit my own needs and published it so i can access it anywhere with my acc
creations-chat 2020-08-30 18:30:06 some are great, some are cursed
creations-chat 2020-08-30 18:30:17 the bottom one is a P45 attempt that FAILED.
creations-chat 2020-08-30 18:30:24 the middle is a small Me 262
creations-chat 2020-08-30 18:30:34 its so small i would consider it a model.
creations-chat 2020-08-30 18:30:51 
creations-chat 2020-08-30 18:30:51 guess.
creations-chat 2020-08-30 18:31:06 a G.91YS, an F-13 and a Me 109
creations-chat 2020-08-30 18:31:15 all three are 100% my own.
creations-chat 2020-08-30 18:31:25 commit NO wedges.
creations-chat 2020-08-30 18:31:30 commit PLYWOOD.
creations-chat 2020-08-30 18:31:58 the devs added a new material called "wood 3" which is basicly an armored wood type
creations-chat 2020-08-30 18:32:03 bruh
creations-chat 2020-08-30 18:32:21 in SM you don't need wedges because of how small an individual block is
creations-chat 2020-08-30 18:32:36 its like a 1/1000 compared to what we have in PC
creations-chat 2020-08-30 18:32:45 its like a 1000 times smoller
creations-chat 2020-08-30 18:33:02 heres the last two
creations-chat 2020-08-30 18:33:07 
creations-chat 2020-08-30 18:33:23 one is a Potez 631. the other is my attempt of a Ju 87
creations-chat 2020-08-30 18:33:41 one issue with SM
creations-chat 2020-08-30 18:33:50 is that when u save something on your lift
creations-chat 2020-08-30 18:33:57 everything is default.
creations-chat 2020-08-30 18:34:22 meaning that even if your wings ARE angled backwards, when uploaded, they will show straight.
creations-chat 2020-08-30 18:35:42 this applies to everything such as pistons, suspension, bearings, even logic parts like lamps (which by default, shine), logic gates, timers, etc.
creations-chat 2020-08-30 18:35:57 btw, i tried to make an AeroTrain in SM
creations-chat 2020-08-30 18:36:04 (the GM Aerotrain from 1955)
creations-chat 2020-08-30 18:36:30 it went very well, you can even drive it
creations-chat 2020-08-30 18:36:54 one issue is that the terrain assets that form tracks in the game aren't avaible due to the survival update.
creations-chat 2020-08-30 18:37:17 meaning that any train we make has to be able to drive on the ground, or be static.
creations-chat 2020-08-30 18:37:40 this one i made so it can move around without tracks but can also be converted to rail use.
creations-chat 2020-08-30 18:38:11 i made it so theres an individual engine, passenger cars, and a default, two passenger car train set.
creations-chat 2020-08-30 18:38:21 as wiring the cars takes time.
creations-chat 2020-08-30 18:38:42 also, large creations in SM get laggy REAL QUICK.
creations-chat 2020-08-30 18:39:09 you wanna see that as well?
creations-chat 2020-08-30 18:39:36 SM isn't very bad at graphics, allthough it does need a powerful computer to run with 120 FPS
creations-chat 2020-08-30 18:40:00 as even with minimum graphics, the larger a creation is more lag will happen.
creations-chat 2020-08-30 18:40:08 because of calculating physics.
creations-chat 2020-08-30 18:40:29 this is why you don't see semi-trucks with detachable trailers often.
creations-chat 2020-09-01 20:01:03 Heyy
creations-chat 2020-09-01 20:02:39 That SS Atlantic looks cool

creations-chat 2020-09-03 15:08:17 
creations-chat 2020-09-03 15:08:42 if you look at pic 1 you may notice that the rudder is not made out of ctrl surfaces
creations-chat 2020-09-03 15:08:54 basicly, ITS A DRIFT MACHINE
creations-chat 2020-09-03 15:09:34 drift machine

creations-chat 2020-09-03 15:10:49 ITS JUST ONE FRAME.
creations-chat 2020-09-03 15:10:58 guess cloudconvert is bad.
creations-chat 2020-09-03 15:11:39 for me its black if i open it in mp4 viewer
creations-chat 2020-09-03 15:11:58 guess a wmv file would be even worse
creations-chat 2020-09-03 15:12:05 would it be tho idk
creations-chat 2020-09-03 15:13:01 lets see how many downvotes this plane would get
creations-chat 2020-09-03 15:14:03 lol its actually getting upvoted
creations-chat 2020-09-03 15:14:19 i built it literally today and there are some issues
creations-chat 2020-09-03 15:14:30 like the cockpit isn't fully enclosed
creations-chat 2020-09-03 15:15:24 pixel art

creations-chat 2020-09-05 04:40:50 I'm not pinging anyone just myself so I can go back to a certain part of conversation
creations-chat 2020-09-12 11:47:36 Hi guys
creations-chat 2020-09-12 11:47:40 Whats up?
creations-chat 2020-09-12 11:49:23 What is a swashplate
creations-chat 2020-09-12 11:49:51 F4U?
creations-chat 2020-09-12 11:50:12 Theres a joke in hungarian
creations-chat 2020-09-12 11:50:27 About the protoss air force or something
creations-chat 2020-09-12 11:50:55 "-Why is the Protoss Air Force great?
Because it is Corsair-u."?
creations-chat 2020-09-12 11:51:34 The thing is corsair with a ű on the end sounds exactly like "korszerű" which is Hungarian for modern
creations-chat 2020-09-12 11:51:46 Thats the joke
creations-chat 2020-09-12 11:52:10 Agreed
creations-chat 2020-10-02 18:23:41 sanic boat
creations-chat 2020-10-02 18:24:04 dat speed tho
creations-chat 2020-10-02 18:24:25 a smal speedboat
creations-chat 2020-10-02 18:24:43 that looks real bad but its sanic
creations-chat 2020-10-02 18:25:08 i make bad looking boats that can go really fast
creations-chat 2020-10-02 18:26:28 idk
creations-chat 2020-10-02 18:26:48 im a man of culture: look
creations-chat 2020-10-02 18:27:20 Peeps of culture dislike their own thing
creations-chat 2020-10-02 18:27:37 so i shall dislike this other one:
creations-chat 2020-10-02 18:28:14 
creations-chat 2020-10-02 18:28:30 its supposed to be a de havilland 89 but it sucks
creations-chat 2020-10-02 18:29:55 well
creations-chat 2020-10-02 18:30:12 it is a way to increase speed to use ctrl surfs as wings
creations-chat 2020-10-02 18:30:30 instead of having wider wings isnt it?
creations-chat 2020-10-02 18:31:16 i also made a bomber version that drops bombs, has a different paint scheme and a different line
creations-chat 2020-10-02 18:31:47 but because roblox doesn't let me write that certain word into that sign
creations-chat 2020-10-02 18:32:03 i have to write 'pales drop' instead of the actual word.
creations-chat 2020-10-02 18:32:40 (note that the word "pales" is meant to refer for a kind of drink that is popular the country i live in as a joke referring to the plane being british)
creations-chat 2020-10-02 18:33:20 as i originally wrote tea drop on it
creations-chat 2020-10-02 18:33:41 but since i changed it to be Hungarian, i had to change the word tea.
creations-chat 2020-10-02 18:38:20 lol who upvoted that DH89
creations-chat 2020-10-02 18:39:16 its not wide its T H I C C
creations-chat 2020-10-02 18:39:36 not thick *T H I C C*
creations-chat 2020-10-02 18:39:53 no u
creations-chat 2020-10-02 18:40:13 its extra thick thats why its T H I C C
creations-chat 2020-10-02 18:40:35 cursed by design
creations-chat 2020-10-02 18:40:58 time to test the palinka bomber
creations-chat 2020-10-02 18:41:14 aka that DH89 bomber i made
creations-chat 2020-10-02 18:42:16 'palinka bomber'
creations-chat 2020-10-20 16:13:47 Try build this plane (DH. 89 dragon rapide)

creations-chat 2020-10-20 16:26:03 what
creations-chat 2020-10-20 16:27:17 a bad Polikarpov-2
creations-chat 2020-10-31 09:55:43 ive downloaded one, then made a plane that can be seen in the pic and repainted it
creations-chat 2020-10-31 09:57:16 original
creations-chat 2020-10-31 09:58:29 current
creations-chat 2020-10-31 09:59:52 what do you guys think?
creations-chat 2020-10-31 10:01:08 welp, the angle makes it hard to see what it actually is.
creations-chat 2020-10-31 10:02:51 btw, do you have any ideas on what its meant to be like say a Ju 87? or if it is custom built? fancy a guess?
creations-chat 2020-10-31 10:04:50 i'd say its some kind of dive bomber (Ju 87 or Dauntless)
creations-chat 2020-10-31 10:06:27 currently:
creations-chat 2020-10-31 10:12:27 btw, ill see what i can do to get the maximum potential out of that plane
creations-chat 2020-10-31 10:14:13 okay, this plane (rn) carries 2 bombs, 2 mgs and two fireworks
creations-chat 2020-10-31 10:26:38 the cake is a lie then yes
creations-chat 2020-10-31 10:39:12 
creations-chat 2020-10-31 10:42:19 bruh clampa's yamato then, it is the same build from different angles in both cases
creations-chat 2020-10-31 10:47:58 what keyboard do you have? english?
creations-chat 2020-10-31 10:50:08 okay. mine is hungarian, i have a separate key for that. i believe french keyboards do, too.
creations-chat 2020-10-31 11:06:48 whats a mistake i made: joining this server as someone who prefers practicality over looks
creations-chat 2020-10-31 11:07:57 lengthen it jacob
creations-chat 2020-10-31 11:08:59 is it just me or does this community not like practical builds over looks
creations-chat 2020-10-31 11:10:10 > RobertoHun1 why not both
<@!476629966780497931> ivan, i build in a smaller scale than most (sized around the roblox character)
creations-chat 2020-10-31 11:12:38 heres a tip: download the image, open it with an image editor (say paint for exampel), as its possible to the same shade with paint (thats how i made camoflague paint some months ago)
creations-chat 2020-10-31 11:15:07 @Blytt i think the red part (idk what its called) could be a bit longer (also imma build the Austro-Hungarian copy of this)
creations-chat 2020-10-31 11:17:06 the IRL copy. SMS Leitha. (built in 1871)
creations-chat 2020-10-31 11:18:23 (still exists today as a museumboat in Budapest, Hungary actually)
creations-chat 2020-10-31 11:27:48 what thing? that grey one?
creations-chat 2020-10-31 11:28:54 why does roblox randomly decide to freeze your game
creations-chat 2020-10-31 11:37:45 idk either. roblox decided to HAH FREEZE
creations-chat 2020-10-31 13:43:04 i like asking for opinions
creations-chat 2020-10-31 13:44:56 i wanted a realistic turret but due to physics, either gun elevation or a good looking turret, and frankly, gun elevation is a better investment for me
creations-chat 2020-10-31 13:46:35 probably due to the bad angle of the screenshot, i assume. ill make sum more screenshots from different angles later.
creations-chat 2020-11-06 18:22:16 guys i believe someone lost their flak gun
creations-chat 2020-11-06 18:24:58 this is the flak gun i just found in a field
creations-chat 2020-11-06 18:27:02 its a flak gun believe it or not
creations-chat 2020-11-06 18:29:06 lel
creations-chat 2020-11-07 11:31:58 guys camouflage or menacing paint scheme
creations-chat 2020-11-07 11:34:03 theres a multiplayer game called "Warplanes: Online Dogfight" for android i got the Bf 110 in that game and its looking menacing i think
creations-chat 2020-11-14 19:05:31 guys
creations-chat 2020-11-14 19:07:11 i have made the next gen F-104 (actually ive reached 3000 studs a second with a mod of this one, but sadly it only worked once)
creations-chat 2020-11-14 19:08:40 guess ill call it F-204
creations-chat 2020-12-08 15:14:24 Good day guys why is there 2 min cooldown, did someone explode something?
creations-chat 2020-12-17 14:25:38 <@548576628113145886>  can you give us a tour of your G5N1?
Just randomly take photos of the inside of it
creations-chat 2020-12-17 14:28:43 Can we get some tech. details like how does it handle on a 0-10 scale/how much payload can it carry
creations-chat 2020-12-17 14:52:13 <@689519544926339123> Looks nice for a first, but i personally find it a bit chunky
creations-chat 2020-12-17 17:18:38 
creations-chat 2020-12-17 18:00:36 why are there so many B-17s? I've seen a lot of them in 2 years and they look almost the same
creations-chat 2020-12-17 18:08:57 oh okay
creations-chat 2020-12-18 11:43:30 Guys I found the B-17 tutorial vid. Im gonna build a B-17 based off that tutorial BUT scaled down since i dont like folding wings
bug-reports 2020-12-24 11:22:51 I'm trying to run/click on the settings tab, but neither works.
bug-reports 2020-12-24 11:23:09 I have video footage, it is converting to Mp4 rn.
bug-reports 2020-12-24 11:23:48 Now, my wifi is bad rn
bug-reports 2020-12-24 11:31:39 im trying to upload it, but the wifi isn't helping at all
creations-chat 2021-01-06 16:06:13 could someone send me a pic of what moe built that got rko'd? Im curious
creations-chat 2021-01-06 16:08:20 Also i saw a bf109 and holy  that looked very good and realistic btw what did u downvote
creations-chat 2021-01-06 16:11:22 I'd like to insert the "I love democracy" line but i wont cause i Definitely do not like democracy
creations-chat 2021-01-06 16:13:23 Btw, does modyfing a tutorial built plane to an extent where it doesn't feel/look low effort anymore count as low effort?
creations-chat 2021-01-06 16:15:31 Bob, i once uploaded a pic of my "flying carpet" (thats what others call it) its op af too, yet it did get like what? 25 dislikes? Here, what counts is looks, not usefulness (sadly.)
creations-chat 2021-01-06 16:17:33 Btw, the name "flying carpet" along others comes from pvp mode cause of the tactics it takes to get that machine a use
(I uploaded it way back, i dont remember the date, or if i even got it up here)
creations-chat 2021-01-06 16:19:45 Just that the standards are a bit messed up in some's opinion (myself as an example.) Also, i tend to downvote my own builds xd (also i wish this timer was like a minute and a half, not two minutes)
creations-chat 2021-01-06 16:21:49 Btw u said "do not upvote caus repost" so i did both just for compensation sake who is hof
creations-chat 2021-01-06 16:23:53 Its a bad idea. 
In fact, dont post anything that is more useful than pretty
creations-chat 2021-01-06 16:32:08 Problem is, prejudice.
(Or something else, idk what to call it.)
Thing is, your first build is what they see first. They wont expect you to do better or worse, but they also don't allow for you to advance forward. (Simular to grammar schools in some cases.)
creations-chat 2021-01-23 03:56:27 Here we dont use meters we use studs (because those are our only given units of measurement in the game.)
creations-chat 2021-01-23 04:02:45 Umm.... someone suggested we shouldn't be warned for low effort builds?
Define low effort.
creations-chat 2021-01-23 04:05:23 Minecraft? Most likely low effort
Tutorials? Most likely low effort
Tutorial aircraft designs with edits in them?
Controversy
creations-chat 2021-01-24 06:20:13 Morning, I seem to have found a Tiger II
creations-chat 2021-02-09 21:24:49 <@718409831639154718> 
"Thruster moment"
More like Highway to the Danger Zone
creations-chat 2021-02-24 18:15:29 Why cant i downvote my own creations
*places bet on getting low-effort'd despite spending about 2 hours building and perfecting the design as much as possible*
creations-chat 2021-02-24 18:45:38 Now i have to rebuild that IL-4 cause the autosave said "its free real estate" and overwrote it
creations-chat 2021-02-24 19:39:04 GAZ-MM russian milk truck

creations-chat 2021-02-24 20:43:41 I just looked through suggestions log channel, saw one about posts here getting buried under others due to notifications
I was like "dude this channel is already biased against us it would be useless"
creations-chat 2021-02-24 20:46:07 <@723333098036527124>  I like the concept, I would scale it down to be usable to power a car or maybe a train
Anthony, would you like to be able to be a chameleon or stand out like a certain Russian sniper?
creations-chat 2021-02-24 20:48:11 Anthony, chameleon mode or stand out like a legendary Russian sniper?
Do so, it will definitely help
creations-chat 2021-02-24 20:50:18 Well... i have written down color codes, problem with them is that they're camouflage colors.
(I've went as far as checking the sky for its color code, which is I think 145 80 200)
creations-chat 2021-02-24 20:52:40 Sorry for text wall, bit of a long list (atleast its organised)

Sky
80 145 200
80 145 193
176 204 211

Water
33 116 148
138 187 201
2 73 83

Ground
11 24 37
118 128 50
103 103 38 

Summer
61 91 77
67 108 74 

Winter
214 219 226
201 203 209
creations-chat 2021-02-24 20:55:16 These are technically aircraft camouflage paint colors*
(That foggy effect is what it is meant to reflect.) The sky ones that start with the 80, those are the real effective ones (non-wintery environment)
creations-chat 2021-02-24 20:59:03 Those sky colors I use on many of my planes work finest (the best use of it being the 'flying carpet')
creations-chat 2021-02-24 21:18:27 As I said, it is meant for that fog effect you get (originally made for aircraft, but, since you said "Please share if your willing, happy to test out diffrent camo's", I sent it over anyway.)
If you don't like it, it isn't a big deal, since every different camo is made to fulfill different goals. How good they do so is the test of a camo.
creations-chat 2021-02-24 21:20:29 Interesting
creations-chat 2021-02-24 21:23:36 These camos were made for day operations, but, with some modifications, they could work at night.
By the 'fog' effect, I meant the one where you look into the distance and see the sky is a bit of a gray color.
Camo at night is a difficult thing to do correctly.
creations-chat 2021-02-24 21:26:12 That wouldn't work. To make night camos work, you must think in three dimensional.
For example, the bottom of the sides and the top need to be 'snowish grey' while the upper parts of the sides need to be black.
creations-chat 2021-02-24 21:28:33 Technically, unlike the summer map, the ground texture color codes aren't very different from each other. In fact, theres only one that changes slightly depending on the time of day in-game.
creations-chat 2021-02-24 21:30:35 I have an idea...
call it ||Littania||
creations-chat 2021-02-24 21:32:36 How I got the color codes is that I simply took a screenshot in-game, then put that photo in Microsoft Paint, then looked at what color that was (it gives you a 3x3 digit color code as well as regular one)
creations-chat 2021-02-24 21:36:00 Remix, i'm suprised that A7D is getting such feedback, since it is Roblox character scale, and those get hated on regulary just look at my builds
(which, with the exception of a small Junkers F-13 have gotten 25+ downvotes prolly)
creations-chat 2021-02-24 21:38:38 Looks good, although I wonder if the game crashes if you hit the ground in that thing
creations-chat 2021-02-24 21:40:39 Semi-Biased opinions. That is why.
creations-chat 2021-02-24 21:42:59 Here, usefulness doesn't count. Only looks do.

creations-chat 2021-03-24 06:20:30 gonna be posting some bus pics
creations-chat 2021-03-24 06:22:52 if i could figure out how to post 3 pics under 1 comment on pc
creations-chat 2021-03-24 06:26:20 probably built that way so the smoke coming from the engine doesn't obscure the bridge's view of the deck. neither do i
creations-chat 2021-03-24 06:28:23 random bus builds, they're reworks, the originals were shorter and much more boxier (and they landed in the hall of shame probably)
creations-chat 2021-03-24 06:30:25 and i wagure that these reworked buses will go to the hall of shame as well. spellius wth do you expect from a community who prefers looks over functions?
creations-chat 2021-03-24 06:35:32 aaand buses gone hall of shame as predicted epik
creations-chat 2021-03-24 06:42:46 i'm not pessimistic, just making overly realistic predictions

creations-chat 2021-10-23 03:40:10 What you do is put two motors with the exact same settings atop each other so the top one spins on the lower one then put your turret on it
bug-reports 2022-08-19 12:04:53 There's a bug report I'd like to make concerning the join friend button, it works with ANYONE.
bug-reports 2022-08-19 17:37:34 Its not intended is it
bug-reports 2022-08-19 18:05:48 it kind of does when the annoying guy with the shredder spam realises it first
bug-reports 2022-08-19 19:13:36 I was in pvp mode and an annoying guy with a shredder ball kept joining me. Dealt with him by making him taste his own medicine.
bug-reports 2022-08-19 19:52:38 No clue
bug-reports 2022-08-19 19:53:15 Do you mean directly or indirectly tho
bug-reports 2022-08-19 19:53:43 I had them directly attached and that was problematic
