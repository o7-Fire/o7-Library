bug-reports 2022-05-19 22:21:04 Noticed when after dropping my bomb from the plane, my plane starts spinning out of control and I have zero control over it. Only noticed this in private server so far
bug-reports 2022-05-19 22:26:33 Did this just start happening? Or have I just noticed it
bug-reports 2022-08-16 00:41:39 Helium seems to be broken. My entire zeppelin keeps getting lifted into the sky too quickly. Even though before when it had helium. It floated perfectly fine. Now it just seems like the helium is super strong for no reason.

creations-chat 2022-10-28 19:37:40 the heck, why did a bunch of people unupvote my creation
creations-chat 2022-10-28 19:41:23 Yeah, it was like at 140 upvotes before. And I came home and somehow its dipped to 79. Just wondering what would've made people do this and how I can improve
creations-chat 2022-10-28 19:45:51 Ah yeah, it might be.
creations-chat 2022-10-28 19:54:11 Yes, I do take that into account sometimes when building stuff in general. Makes it more unique and stands out from what people have already made a million times
creations-chat 2022-10-28 19:56:49 Very nice! I like how you did the curves for the hull and added portholes
