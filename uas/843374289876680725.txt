creations-chat 2022-01-11 21:00:48 yea i guess
creations-chat 2022-01-11 21:02:59 well thats my problem i lack putting dtail and when i do it makes no sense
creations-chat 2022-01-11 21:05:16 alr ima start dumping stuff all over it
creations-chat 2022-01-11 22:52:51 finished dumping detail onto it how is it now?
creations-chat 2022-01-11 22:55:02 alr lol
creations-chat 2022-01-11 23:19:04 thx for the advice i fix it
creations-chat 2022-01-12 20:21:26 dude you have to actually put time and effort into your build DRONES made of 10 blocks wont cut it...
creations-chat 2022-01-12 20:31:25 dude its trash now stop trying to defend yourself
creations-chat 2022-01-12 20:33:33 EXACTLY my point ill put hours of work into my builds and then this kid builds a 10 block drone and expects everyone to call him master
creations-chat 2022-01-12 20:35:40 its a light bar genius
creations-chat 2022-01-12 20:37:42 ight...but all the "hover thruster" on my build are light bc the game doesn't have to many blocks i can call lights that look good bc im not gonna place block lights it just kills the look.
creations-chat 2022-01-12 20:43:54 no its not...
creations-chat 2022-01-12 20:59:18 I bet the 3 people that down voted me are the same people mad bc i have a HUGE light bar on the front for a 15ton machine that's mission is to mine in caves and is literally a base ...
creations-chat 2022-01-12 21:13:34 DUDE I PUT AS MUCH DETAIL AS I COULD
creations-chat 2022-01-12 21:29:34 `LIKE I SAID THERE ARE NO BLOCKS TO REPLACE IT AND LOOK NORMAL THEY HARDLY UPDATE THE GAME SO ITS KINDA HARD TO WORK WITH`
creations-chat 2022-01-12 21:35:31 alr
