creations-chat 2022-11-08 20:14:53 I donâ€™t understand the skull but I assume that youâ€™re annoyed with me/believe the plans to be idiotic, and I can assure you I have no complete belief that itâ€™ll work

The whole thing could just adios into the void for all I know

creations-chat 2023-03-23 12:20:21 a lotta people are making the cardboard and nails joke, but if u do want to fix the trapdoor spots I suggest instead using disconnectors and having them disconnect on launch so that only the flat part stays

I do it all the time with my builds


Reply to ace because of this stupidly fucking long timer: yeah that could work too
