**[New Effect switch in pvp mode ?]**

**[Other] [PVP]**

**[Description :]**
So when you die in PVP mode, your build just crumbles down into many 'parts' which is very laggy considering it also has physics.
So add a switch in the setting's menu where you can turn that off so that like- your build just despawns.
It is meant to help people with bad PC (like me) to not crash when dying. (don't laugh, dying is normal in pvp mode)
