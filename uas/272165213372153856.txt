creations-chat 2021-07-06 02:17:36 if we seriously are basing creations off of effort we have to be considerate of skill levels, as they vary depending on the person. it's my biggest fucking problem in this server.

people don't appriciate different artstyles and progress. they bitch and complain about other's getting upvotes when they downvote other creations.

mods here aren't curators tho, so nothing much can be done about this.
