creations-chat 2020-09-28 08:59:12 furthest I've gotten is motorlocking flaps on my plane

help 2020-09-28 12:01:26 How do you make bombs not rotate like crazy
help 2020-09-28 12:01:45 to put this into context

creations-chat 2020-09-28 12:17:39 yeah
creations-chat 2020-09-28 12:18:43 this is how it looks unfolded, don't mind the deployment blocks on the sides
creations-chat 2020-10-07 11:16:19 <@!672135256958173225> straznik would be probably easier
creations-chat 2020-10-07 11:17:02 because of the shape, but smialy would be very cool
creations-chat 2020-10-07 11:17:45 and if it could run the bolt of the "rifle"
creations-chat 2020-10-07 11:18:01 that would be absolutely epic
creations-chat 2020-10-07 11:18:33 yes
creations-chat 2020-10-07 11:18:54 but that would be like really complicated
creations-chat 2020-10-07 11:19:20 still, imagine a IH mech in plane crazy 🤤
creations-chat 2020-10-07 11:20:03 I think?
creations-chat 2020-10-07 11:20:20 can it lift from the spot?
creations-chat 2020-10-07 11:21:13 not what I asked but whatever
creations-chat 2020-10-07 13:14:02 looks cool, but put 4 barrels on it instead of 2 + 2 rockets
creations-chat 2020-10-07 13:14:21 for  i m m e r s i o n
creations-chat 2020-10-07 13:14:48 wait, straznik with cannons?
creations-chat 2020-10-07 13:15:04 *impossible*
creations-chat 2020-10-09 19:12:43 looks more like charioteer rn tbh
creations-chat 2020-10-09 19:12:59 with a really long lauf
creations-chat 2020-10-10 08:17:25 ah, I suppose left
help 2021-09-24 14:29:47 is that normal for stuff like rockets launched from disconnectors to freeze in the air after like .5 seconds of flight?
help 2021-09-24 14:32:34 the rocket just floats in the air, like its stuck in time
help 2021-09-24 14:32:57 bruh
help 2021-09-24 14:33:16 well there goes my plan
help 2021-09-24 14:33:20 anyways thanks
help 2021-09-25 15:20:09 anyone can tell if this is good direction to head in?
help 2021-09-25 15:20:25 i'm trying to make an effective ground to air missile
help 2021-09-25 15:21:13 this thing turns pretty well, but many aircraft can outrun it, although it has 3 super rocket engines
help 2021-09-25 15:23:18 i cant really measure the speed, but it reaches the floating island in around 5 seconds
help 2021-09-26 18:44:29 any ideas on how to make this more compact?
help 2021-09-26 18:45:09 there are 2 thrusters in the middle and one in the back
help 2021-09-26 18:45:18 the whole thing is held together by the half wedges
help 2021-09-26 18:46:46 tbh i dont really care about the length, i mostly need it more narrow
help 2021-09-26 18:46:59 so it can fit on planes and into launchers better
help 2021-09-26 18:47:07 this is just way too large
help 2021-09-26 18:47:41 re-engineer the entire plane to have fly backwards as default
help 2021-09-26 18:48:14 then just rebind the plane and use it backwards
help 2021-10-10 19:15:07 is the slowing down of parachutes flat value or is it dependant on the size of parachute?
help 2021-10-10 19:22:45 great, thank you
help 2021-10-10 19:23:27 i'm playing with parachute carpet bombing a bit, so i was wondering if the bombs could fall a bit faster :D
help 2021-10-10 19:25:28 yeah i do that for stabilization, but i wanted to make something similar to what dutch WW2 carpet bombers used
help 2021-10-10 19:25:44 shown pretty nicely in world of warships
help 2021-10-11 13:30:16 most probably potato pc
help 2021-10-11 13:30:23 or you used laggy stuff
help 2021-10-11 13:30:32 like springs, parachutes and such
help 2021-10-11 13:43:11 i honestly think neither of these
help 2021-10-11 13:43:20 since 1 stud is .28 meters
help 2021-10-11 13:43:31 and blocks are around 2 studs wide
help 2021-10-11 13:43:58 so around .56 meters per block, but i'm sure i'm not correct
creations-chat 2021-10-11 15:04:39 i wonder how to make the rockets not stick together
creations-chat 2021-10-11 15:19:32 interesting
creations-chat 2021-10-11 15:27:57 yeah also that
help 2021-10-11 18:32:11 question, do magnets work on other player constructs?
help 2021-10-11 18:33:03 sadge, no magnetic anti air missiles
help 2021-10-11 18:33:24 probably yes
help 2021-10-11 18:33:34 however that means that i cant solve my problem
help 2021-10-11 18:34:02 which is that i cant seem to make the explosives explode on impact with enemy aircraft
help 2021-10-11 18:34:17 it works like 2/10 times
help 2021-10-11 18:34:45 and when it works, server just makes sure, that the explosion will happen like 20 blocks behind the enemy
creations-chat 2021-10-12 17:26:33 in your case i'm not really surprised
creations-chat 2021-10-12 17:28:37 well, maybe you just posted in wrong time
creations-chat 2021-10-12 17:34:35 also the colors look like someone had a paintball match nearby, and a goddamn long one that is
creations-chat 2021-10-12 17:44:29 looks minimalistic enough, i like them
help 2021-10-13 13:08:53 I have a question (again), what is the difference between block and paint block?
creations-chat 2021-10-13 13:10:04 now that is one nice truck
help 2021-10-13 13:13:43 oooo, thank you, didnt know that
help 2021-10-13 13:21:02 uh, i suppose motors cease to work after being motorlocked right?
help 2021-10-13 13:21:36 or i mean if i put motor on a motorlock tower, the motor wont work after the tower is locked right?
help 2021-10-13 13:24:33 nevermind they do, i'm just dumb
help 2021-10-13 14:10:27 isnt it connected to something that shouldnt be moving?
help 2021-10-13 14:10:34 like to a side of some block or something
help 2021-10-13 14:11:59 is it turned correctly?
help 2021-10-13 14:12:25 you know, if it isnt the other way around
help 2021-10-13 14:15:10 weird
help 2021-10-13 14:18:04 Is there any way of fitting mechanical landing gear (not the premade one) into 1 block wide 2 blocks high space?
help 2021-10-13 14:18:45 without changing the surrounding blocks
help 2021-10-13 14:19:52 this space to be precise
help 2021-10-13 14:20:33 motorlocking it seems to break it
help 2021-10-13 14:21:17 lemme do that rq, if it works you deserve a flippin medal
help 2021-10-13 14:22:12 i'm sitting for half a hour over this and i cant seem to get it working, thats why
help 2021-10-13 14:27:43 interesting
help 2021-10-13 14:35:56 thank you, it works
help 2021-10-13 14:36:18 one more thing though, how did you make the long shaft of your landing gear?
help 2021-10-13 14:36:29 no, i meant the locking of the motor
help 2021-10-13 14:37:24 okay okay let me reformulate it
help 2021-10-13 14:37:58 thank you for the advise of locking the motor in the motorlock tower
help 2021-10-13 14:38:28 what?
help 2021-10-13 14:38:50 you literally advised me to do it here
help 2021-10-13 14:40:05 you know what, nevermind
help 2021-10-13 14:42:25 i did not
help 2021-10-13 14:42:38 why would i be asking you how you made the bloody thing
help 2021-10-13 14:42:45 if i had it copied already
creations-chat 2021-10-13 15:48:24 does anyone know the answer to why is there 2 min slowmode in this channel?
creations-chat 2021-10-13 16:28:27 why do i feel like me 262 is the most common plane in here?
creations-chat 2021-10-13 16:31:23 its probably easier for most, i'm building me262 rn to learn some new techniques and stuff
creations-chat 2021-10-13 17:06:33 i need a bit of advice, should i make my wings straight, but the engines nicer or the wings tilted, but the engines not as nice?
i cant seem to make both of these work together, because the one starts glitching the other when combined
creations-chat 2021-10-13 17:09:24 the wing is being tilted by a motor, the engine would have to be put in via motorlock tower, however it would have to be tilted by a motor aswell, but when i do both, for some reason it all starts to glitch around uncontrollably
creations-chat 2021-10-13 17:11:53 you can see the motor that should tilt the engine (placeholder block) in the cameras in the top of the screen, and the motor next to my right, which should tilt the wing
when i remove the disconnectors it just explodes
creations-chat 2021-10-13 17:15:06 i did, when i let it lock in, it does this and starts to shake, i would have to move the top motor outside the plane, which is not really optimal solution
creations-chat 2021-10-13 18:55:17 when you really want to hit that 999 motor limit
help 2021-10-13 19:42:39 what ratio of wing surface - control surface is advised?
creations-chat 2021-10-13 19:45:43 <@!702590900852883683> you should invest 2 minutes of your life into repainting the weapons, other than that looks like a lovely model
creations-chat 2021-10-13 20:29:10 <@!466628021273624586> ~~me like some target practice~~ tbh i quite like it, except this cringe meme-thing
creations-chat 2021-10-13 20:52:19 idk, i like it, or atleast i dont see why you shouldnt like it
its more of an exoskeleton than a full on mech, but a likeable creation nontheless
creations-chat 2021-10-13 21:24:20 plot twist: it is a threat
help 2021-10-13 21:33:44 speed doesnt matter if you cant control it lol
creations-chat 2021-10-13 21:40:43 how does it look so far? still need to do loads of stuff like landing gear, balancing, some nice paint etc
help 2021-10-14 08:23:44 make the hull the same black as your turrets are and make the hull less blue imo, or like change the way it is coloured with the blue colour
help 2021-10-14 08:24:08 however the shape is great
creations-chat 2021-10-14 08:28:02 l like it alot, only thing that kinda doesnt fit in is the glass half sphere in the front, it just doesnt fit the rest of the front, i like it for the back gunner turret, but for the front its kinda eeeh imo
creations-chat 2021-10-14 08:30:44 well, seems like less is more sometimes
creations-chat 2021-10-14 10:13:46 can you screenshot it from the side?
creations-chat 2021-10-14 10:16:07 very interesting design, i like it, however you should consider putting in some motorlocking and anglelocking, especially for the turret to make it more turrety lol
creations-chat 2021-10-14 10:18:51 you know, some detail like boxes, ladders into storage and stuff, look up the M60 build here https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/384025409945337856/897914976738639933
creations-chat 2021-10-14 10:55:47 any thoughts?
creations-chat 2021-10-14 10:57:51 could you be more specific, this doesnt tell me anything really
creations-chat 2021-10-14 11:50:01 yeah, you and <@!721103577380159490> are both right, but i spent way too much time to redo the entire hull now, maybe some other time lol, besides that, anything else?
creations-chat 2021-10-14 11:59:27 fair enough, that shouldnt be too hard to do
irl it should have the elevator slapped on the side of the rudder, but i'm not skilled enough to do that lol
creations-chat 2021-10-14 17:14:13 oh come on its not that terrible (okay maybe it is), its my first actual plane, the last one is somewhere in <#384025409945337856>, i'm not trying to advocate my build, i'm just giving you the full context
creations-chat 2021-10-14 17:25:34 tbh that could potentially happen, i have over 4 days and i started to learn motorlocking just now
creations-chat 2021-10-14 17:44:53 i dont get whats wrong with that, let people play how they want smh
creations-chat 2021-10-14 18:14:35 why is male chicken considered suggestive smh <:trollface:775024642104229898>
creations-chat 2021-10-20 14:23:58 1. plastic surgery
2. not wearing makeup
3. been on a diet
<:trollface:775024642104229898>
creations-chat 2022-03-10 18:43:44 i remember when planes like this one were getting 30+ upvotes, but that was 2 years ago
creations-chat 2022-03-10 18:46:28 good thing you didnt see my me-262 then lol
creations-chat 2022-03-10 18:50:06 why should he ignore me, are you his mom or what?
creations-chat 2022-03-10 18:52:45 because after the years of creations existing, they expect every build to be like those in hall of fame
creations-chat 2022-03-10 19:13:32 it has been like this since the dawn of man, sir
creations-chat 2022-03-10 20:30:45 exposed.
creations-chat 2022-03-10 20:33:11 thats not critique though, thats just being mean
creations-chat 2022-03-10 20:38:13 imagine continuing to be toxic lol
creations-chat 2022-03-10 20:41:03 who?
