creations-chat 2021-01-27 23:41:31 you know what? f35 is cool, but its too hard to make a  high detail plane with that stupid engine. im making an f22 instead

creations-chat 2021-02-20 03:02:16 <@743956753942577203>  cool f4, make sure your rear wings fold, idk if they do, and replace those wedges with half wedges, so the 2 flat faces meet, and fill in the gap with wedge half (from half block category)
