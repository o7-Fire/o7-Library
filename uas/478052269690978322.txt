help 2021-02-26 04:11:28 you'd probably have to do custom angle stuff
help 2021-02-26 04:12:30 to put it simply in case u dont know how to do that, motor 1 with powered and locked, then turn the motor to the angle u want it at, then use toggle motor lock to lock it. It can be a pain to get right at first but if u put a point of reference it can be pretty easy
help 2021-02-26 04:20:50 u cant really see the toggle motor lock part but the red motor is powered and locked so when i untoggle the motor lock it folds at a custom angle
help 2021-02-26 04:22:08 
help 2021-02-26 04:44:35 ok the army of motorlock in the background probably makes it look harder than it actually is
