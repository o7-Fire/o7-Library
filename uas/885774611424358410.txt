creations-chat 2023-07-03 11:29:24 can anyone give me feedback on this t64?
creations-chat 2023-07-03 12:06:12 https://streamable.com/ye396b vid of my atgm
creations-chat 2023-07-03 15:58:13 it is lol, i put the build in creations
creations-chat 2023-07-03 16:02:33 yeah thats true, i kinda just built a mtlb and slapped a atgm i made on there and called it a day without changing it lol
creations-chat 2023-07-03 16:05:21 i think i will but instead i will use disconectors and signs and maybe trails as i can do more detail
creations-chat 2023-07-05 21:27:55 tonk
creations-chat 2023-07-05 21:31:55 hey i am trying to post my build in creations but the bot is telling me to stop spamming lol ðŸ’€
creations-chat 2023-07-05 21:34:42 yay i finally was able to put it in there ðŸ’€
creations-chat 2023-07-05 22:38:25 it has two layers, the angle of it makes it look like it has more though, i only put 2 there because missiles where penning through the cage haha, thank you for the advice though
creations-chat 2023-07-05 22:40:42 bruh im not adding a radar to a tank, the cage is good, it looks good and works good, it either makes the missile bounch or only destroys the cage, thanks for the adive though (also alot of rockets and missiles now are scatter rockets so the radar wouldnt work)
creations-chat 2023-07-05 22:43:12 i mainly build for design tbh, most tanks with detail get destroyed so fast in pvp lol
creations-chat 2023-07-05 22:45:42 this has to be the worst thing i have ever seen, a firework will never stop a custom rocket flying at you, like ever.
creations-chat 2023-07-05 22:48:08 do you realise i am talking about custom rockets lol, even so flares dont really work, the basic missiles are easy to avoid anyways (also why would i put flares on a tank ðŸ’€)
