creations-chat 2022-05-18 22:30:33 The only problem I have with it is the length to wing span, but it's not that bad, and even if the wings aren't perfectly stable, it still flies pretty well

creations-chat 2022-05-18 22:48:35 The colours are fine, it just doesn't show well on the screenshot for some reason. It's not "feedback" really. It's just criticism. <@567763933952475157> hehe, furry Boi here cat picture I'm literally 14 in like 12 days,

creations-chat 2022-07-06 05:42:03 Fair point, the movies ARE really good, and yeah that makes sense, I woulda never heard of the movies if my grandma didn't have me watch it a few years back
creations-chat 2022-07-06 05:47:21 Southern and country music is pretty good, I was probably shown when I was about 10, but I'm not much of a car need, I like ships. My grandma is a car nerd, and I'd say my favorite part is the part where all the truckers get together and fight the cops haha

creations-chat 2022-07-26 04:11:44 Hehe, Yorktown
creations-chat 2022-07-26 04:14:42 Your superstructure is shaped a bit weird and why is it blue but I guess it's okay
creations-chat 2022-07-26 04:16:54 Oh and the fantail doesn't have that weird angle that you're doing with the half wedges there

Oh and you should put another layer of thr railings behind the other layer so it'd visible from both sides
creations-chat 2022-07-26 04:19:17 See, it's flat at the back so that the aircraft can be rolled out of the hanger
The little angling going on back there is what I'm talking about
creations-chat 2022-07-26 04:21:54 Alright, but you should put another sign with the railing on the backside of the other rails so it can be seen from both sides
creations-chat 2022-08-03 02:48:51 <@668294916274913280> you should make your typhoon into Red October
Hehe, *noice*
