events-chat 2022-03-21 21:25:09 How does one unsubscribe to the events channel?
creations-chat 2022-05-07 23:00:10 Its called creations chat, that means you give details as to what was done wrong and how to fix it. You should kindly keep your keyboard silent if you have nothing constructive to criticize me for.
creations-chat 2022-05-07 23:07:55 "A channel to discuss posts in <#384025409945337856>. **If someone is being toxic, contact staff.**"
creations-chat 2022-05-07 23:12:50 I don't see a point.. I just see a lack of maturity.
creations-chat 2022-05-07 23:14:47 Its a french blue color for ground forces, I just wanted realism
creations-chat 2022-05-07 23:19:38 poo fard doesnt mean anything. I'm very sure this channel was intended for constructive feedback, not destructive. I will follow up with suggestions if i even keep the vehicle. I have also been pondering, why don't you treat me like a human being? We are all humans and a video game rank shouldnt determine how you treat eachother.
creations-chat 2022-05-07 23:22:24 Why do I even bother arguing about this lol, its an old build
creations-chat 2022-05-07 23:25:13 I expected to be criticized in a way that helps me get better at building. If you don't understand the logic behind that, then I suggest you go back to pre-school where you "learned" to behave.
creations-chat 2022-05-07 23:32:29 Thank you for clarification.
creations-chat 2022-07-01 20:45:40 why is it that having a white nametag is something so despised?

help 2023-02-18 17:02:37 No i am not salty about my funny image being deleted because it was funny.
help 2023-02-18 17:07:40 Perhaps it can also be included why these people are generally toxic towards eachother
help 2023-02-18 17:07:54 Would be really helpful any insight yall could give
help 2023-04-09 16:34:24 I have a ship of 17,000 blocks that uses TNT to lock itself, and it used to be 18.5k blocks and spawn flawlessly--has there been any bugs with plane crazy recently? I also can not despawn, I have to wait at least half a minute for it to do so.

help 2023-04-09 16:46:41 It worked before perfectly
help 2023-04-09 16:46:46 with 1.5k more blocks
help 2023-04-09 16:47:44 The entire creation is more susceptible to glitching out of existence
help 2023-04-09 16:58:23 It used to spawn perfectly with more blocks
help 2023-04-09 16:58:37 Which means there is a glitchy block or two-- i think i just found the source
