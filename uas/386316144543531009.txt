bug-reports 2019-08-18 02:13:41 I don't know what to say other than bruh
bug-reports 2019-08-18 02:14:53 Oh and conveyers aren't working on the server too apparently
creations-chat 2021-01-07 00:52:54 Wait so is the only thing people actually care about how a build looks?
creations-chat 2021-01-07 00:55:00 Yeah, getting stable flight was a head ache tho. I kept having to mess with the center of mass to get it stable. Even like half a block in the wrong spot sent it spiraling
creations-chat 2021-01-07 05:04:07 I don't get it 😔  What's the issue with the heli and how do I make it better? I don't want to just build WW2 planes like every other damn person.
creations-chat 2021-01-07 05:50:49 Do you have any examples of good heli designs? I'm trying to improve :p
creations-chat 2021-01-07 05:53:45 Yeah the double rotor thing is an easy fix but I wouldn't exactly say it's super easy to copy helis from real life when the limitations of the game make helis already a nightmare to stabilize

The issue with the center of mass made several designs I based of real helis fall in to the void in about half a second
creations-chat 2021-01-07 05:56:57 Yes but it isn't stable when you base it off real life helicopters. The design is easy but getting it to fly is stupid difficult
creations-chat 2021-01-07 05:59:50 I've tried ballast blocks in the past which had no effect (Something like a year ago) and helium is cheating. The whole challenge of helicopters comes from trying to balance it so unless ballast was changed for the better real life designs just aren't as doable
creations-chat 2021-01-07 06:01:59 I'll need to revisit the ballast blocks. I wouldn't be surprised if they work now and it's never a 1-1 or 2-1 or whatever but the shape of the craft often leaves the tail end waaaaay heavier then the front
creations-chat 2021-01-07 06:04:59 Yee but like Lemme trie and draw this out real quick
creations-chat 2021-01-07 07:01:27 It looks like a car 😎 (I do not watch anime but I have *that one friend* who won't shut tf up about jojo)
creations-chat 2021-01-07 07:04:08 I think it'd be cool if you added some sort of spiky thing that pops out
and more spikes too
Tis a very spiky car
why is there slomode here anywyas

creations-chat 2021-01-07 07:06:36 Big mood, stay in school kids, or still keep a good sleep schedule for mental health reasons... and jobs... *just get sleep >:|*
creations-chat 2021-01-07 08:21:30 I mean you could sorta do it with servos but it wouldn't look as good as motor lock

Ohh and theres wacky fucking slo mo so just edit whatever your most recent thing was until you can make a new one 😔
creations-chat 2021-01-07 13:29:50 Dang, I use to play this game like 2 years ago and got back into it to make realistic helicopters because they scare me and I must conquer my fears...

Intake go ***succcc***
Eat up all that air
creations-chat 2021-01-07 13:33:46 Yeah the issue with battle ships is that you either make them too small or you spend 50 hours on it. My first big project was a big old plane that had folding wings and stuff. Looking back at it it's garbage but it's still kinda cool. For the time there wasnt anything that used motors to fold the build together other than fat ass battleships.

help 2021-01-09 02:34:51 Working on making funny chinook but when I use toggled servos for the blade's angle it fucks everything up and the servos start causing the build to vibrate. It works perfectly fine without the set of servos. I thought about using regular motors but with them I cant get a constant angle every launch making tuning a tail rotor for counter spin damn near impossible as well as making it impossible to change mid flight as trying to causes it to lock up sideways. How to fix?
creations-chat 2021-01-09 02:40:56 wip chinook. Main rotors down (for the most part) next tail rotors, then the body, lastly the hook and winch and funni

help 2021-01-09 05:57:43 I think maybe if I place them directly attacked to the prop blades it might fix it. idk, just a theory
help 2021-01-09 06:24:41 Yeah that somehow worked

Okay and how do you suggest I do that
creations-chat 2021-01-16 23:42:08 Yeah, the tail rotor is for turning because everything else causes the rotors to implode
creations-chat 2021-01-16 23:47:46 Yeah but nothing else works for turning, everyhting else I've tried cause the motors that control the main rotors to implode. I've spent probably 4 hours total troubleshooting it.
creations-chat 2021-01-16 23:55:22 Imma keep it real with you motorlock is a pain in the ass and I spent at least an hour trying to use it to find a solution

creations-chat 2021-01-19 15:29:20 Try motorlocking the chair into the cockpit that's like the first and most important thing to do.
creations-chat 2021-01-19 15:32:37 What you want to do is place a motor face up unpowered and locked, everything else doesnt really matter, then place a second motor face down same settings, behind the upper motor place one face up same settings and on top of that face down same setting and basically build a staircase, from there attach blocks and scream in agony as you defy all logic and reason
creations-chat 2021-01-19 15:34:50 make the color lighter and have it vary a bit, like that block 505050 that block 707070

creations-chat 2021-01-20 14:02:01 Motorlock gives me PTSD 😨
creations-chat 2021-01-20 14:08:28 That's mean... But true. Coloring is bad (never use any black color under like 50 50 50) always motor lock the pilot seat into the cockpit (in small crafts) and lastly, hover thruster have been and always will be dog shit
creations-chat 2021-01-20 14:14:31 default landing gear, not pog. And I would complain about there being no motorlock on the wings but Im not a little bitch
creations-chat 2021-01-20 14:18:13 Ok so there's this "mechanic" called motor lock and what it is is unpowered, locked motors stacked in a specific way that cause them and any blocks attached to them to collapse into a smaller region allowing you to further detail crafts in smaller areas.
creations-chat 2021-01-20 14:21:18 Ohh people constantly complain about how the default wings look too narrow on planes and so they use motor lock to make them look thicker by placing a layer of blocks over everything.
creations-chat 2021-01-20 18:30:03 Im sorry a what what wip?

creations-chat 2021-01-24 22:48:26 Big heli, how improve? Looking for final suggestions before posting to creations
creations-chat 2021-01-24 22:54:16 A few, the top half looks very blocky and could use some more detailing (some ladders sprinkled here and there could help), and the monochrome color scheme is wack and could do with a bit of diversity. <@456226577798135808>
creations-chat 2021-01-24 22:56:57 It's not the color that's the issue, most are very gray from what I understand; however, they are also multiple shades of gray, not just one. A little bit darker near more mechanical parts and a few blocks a bit lighter on the top as if the sun was reflecting off it could go a long way
creations-chat 2021-01-24 23:09:53 Having some detail on the sides of the main body such as some half cylinders and ladders could help make it look more detailed without going into motor lock hell
creations-chat 2021-01-24 23:11:54 Maybe, trap doors and trails are also nice for detailing.
I gtg, but I'll take a look at if if you post another pic here
creations-chat 2021-01-25 00:09:02 Already much better
creations-chat 2021-01-25 00:14:56 not at the moment, I'm not all that good at detailing tbh

Bruh " that interior kinda sucks. change the floor color and a lot of things" is hella vague. Doesn't specify anything and the closest it gets is change the floor color but doesn't give any examples of colors that might work

creations-chat 2021-01-26 14:13:44 You use a form of thrust other than the main and tail rotor to turn or maneuver. Just put it on a set of servos to give it 2 axis rotation for movement.

help 2021-01-26 14:46:58 Do you know how to motorlock?
help 2021-01-26 14:48:00 Aight make the main rotor's motor unpowered and motorlock a bunch of rockets / hover thrusters on the wing panels to make it spin dummy fast, that should help it get off the ground and stuff
help 2021-01-26 14:48:26 As for speed helis aren't exactly fast but 60 is a fairly decent speed to try and get
help 2021-01-26 14:48:55 Use hover thrusters then
help 2021-01-26 14:49:02 Because apparently that also works
