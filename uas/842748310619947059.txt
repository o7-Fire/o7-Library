The Tale of _flame_5415 (842748310619947059)
help 2021-09-26 12:06:05 So i have a little problem with my helicopter, so it can fly and it turn right and left smoothly, the thing is that it keep bouncing forward and backward if you see what i mean. I could fix that by adding helium blocks apply at centre and minimizing the size of the panels but once again when i click W (i used propellers so it doesn't go crazy) it does the same thing then before, it start bouncing and if you wait a bit it reverse itself
help 2021-09-26 12:07:45 anyone knows how to fix that ?

bug-reports 2021-11-04 04:04:39 Guys i don't know if this is only for plane crazy or all games, but you can't friend request now. You need to go on the website, search the username and friend request and the other player need to do the same thing too
