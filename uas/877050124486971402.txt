creations-chat 2023-07-04 03:58:15 by blocky i mean , u only place those blocks like lego , u wont try to find a way to make soemthing smoother

creations-chat 2023-07-07 02:09:41 reference photo of x02s (they looks the same expect for the folded wing)
creations-chat 2023-07-07 02:15:16 basically theres a piston 
it push the wing upward
