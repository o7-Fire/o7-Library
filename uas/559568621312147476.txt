creations-chat 2021-04-16 14:57:13 For your train, you should add a bit more shading and detail to it in the color and material department, since most locos are usually not that clean, maybe add a bit of rust or variation in coloring to give it that effect

creations-chat 2021-04-16 15:30:21 Wdym from 2017, the 2017 Godzilla doesn’t look even remotely close
creations-chat 2021-04-16 15:41:35 Yea how, it’s too blocky, and even I admit that, plus the tails too short but atleast the head is decent
creations-chat 2021-04-16 15:48:25 Wished they added more wedge options, would make building a lot easier
creations-chat 2021-04-16 15:52:33 It’s not like he’s hating on wedges
creations-chat 2021-04-16 15:58:15 Jesus, it’s not like I want to build that way, it’s just that my Godzilla’s not done if you look closely(which is hard) you can see that parts of the body uses wedges and some don’t , I just posted it here to see what you guys think
creations-chat 2021-04-16 16:00:50 Building would be so much simpler if they just added a quarter block
creations-chat 2021-04-16 16:07:45 Too wide
creations-chat 2021-04-16 16:13:38 Wut car?
creations-chat 2021-04-16 16:15:55 Kinda hard to give feedback on a custom
creations-chat 2021-04-17 00:53:03 How well does it move
creations-chat 2021-04-17 00:55:25 Good, I’ve seen some good looking trains that are crap with moving through corners
creations-chat 2021-04-17 04:20:57 wat yall think of my old godzilla mech
creations-chat 2021-04-17 04:24:05 I’m planning on making the arms move and maybe the head but the head seems a bit too much for the motors to handle
creations-chat 2021-04-17 04:26:24 Well, Godzilla’s supposed to have a big chest lol

creations-chat 2021-04-17 05:00:32 That’s a nice godzilla, which godzilla is it tho, 2019?
creations-chat 2021-04-17 05:03:01 I do think it’s nice but the head could be improved, here’s a pic if you need it
creations-chat 2021-04-17 05:06:43 I mean, it’s not the best godizlla Build I’ve seen but it’s pretty good
creations-chat 2021-04-17 05:08:55 Depends on which Godzilla there making, early 2000’s and 2014 Godzilla’s have pretty spiky dorsal fins
creations-chat 2021-04-17 05:11:33 Are you sure it was a 2019 godzilla build cuz 2014 godzilla is similar but he has spiky dorsal fins
creations-chat 2021-04-17 05:17:18 Aight

creations-chat 2021-04-21 14:15:32 what yall think of my newly improved aston martin DB5, it has a flipping license plate, ejection seat, rear window shield, extending battering rams, smoke screen and it can go underwater
creations-chat 2021-04-21 14:19:09 Just a disclaimer, the back is rather ugly as it does house a few features, there are only 2 tail lights instead of 3 since the rear doesn’t have space for all 3
creations-chat 2021-04-21 14:25:57 heres the video you asked for
creations-chat 2021-04-21 14:28:35 i apologize for the horrible video quality, this is cuz i use screencast because for some reason, other recording softwares dont work and this is the only one i know, it also makes me lag ALOT
creations-chat 2021-04-21 14:35:50 another car i made, the toyota ae86 panda trueno with working pop ups, what do yall think?
creations-chat 2021-04-21 15:39:04 I used propulsion for pitch on my boring 2707 cuz back then, I was really bad with building planes and the moving f14 like wing just messes up some of the Handling

creations-chat 2021-04-26 15:26:26 Great feedback guys, thnx a lot
creations-chat 2021-04-26 15:32:59 People keep mistaking the Buddhist symbol for the third reich symbol
creations-chat 2021-04-26 15:36:15 Third reich one is right facing and is at an angle 45 degrees while the Buddhism one is facing left and isn’t at an angle
creations-chat 2021-04-26 15:38:38 “Tiny details” bruh , anyone with functional brain cells and eyes can see the difference, the problem is, is that no one even knows what the Buddhism symbol is, some people dont even know it exists
creations-chat 2021-04-26 16:31:38 Wdym by black part of the scales, the entire body is black
creations-chat 2021-04-26 16:35:37 Oh, I mean yea I guess, I would add a bit of blending to make it a bit less weird but it’s sorta accurate
creations-chat 2021-05-04 14:37:09 second motor behind the first motor for turning
creations-chat 2021-05-05 11:54:22 wat do you guys think about my f4 phantom
creations-chat 2021-05-12 03:46:37 Last time I ask for feedback, no one really replied so can y’all give me some feedback now? This is the Showa mechaGodzilla
creations-chat 2021-05-12 03:50:34 <@!650607070382522398> the head looks like one of the animatronics from Fnaf and eyes need to be more aggressive and the snout to wide
creations-chat 2021-05-12 03:55:31 I shortened the head a while ago, the picture I sent was kinda outdated and the neck is already very long
creations-chat 2021-05-14 09:22:57 i would remove the gun but its the only block that would look good there and i know that the F4C doesnt have a gun at the front, why do you think theres a gun pod on the belly
creations-chat 2021-05-14 09:26:27 ? thats what that is, the only reason theres a gun there is because its the only block that would look good there
creations-chat 2021-05-14 09:28:33 
creations-chat 2021-05-14 09:37:04 <@!720891502108344360> that plane looks like it was made in simple planes
creations-chat 2021-05-14 09:41:04 <@!720891502108344360> yea lol, its uncanny
creations-chat 2021-05-14 09:44:08 Aight  but I wasn’t gonna download a plane just to prove a point, I just slightly modified the p51 mustang that comes standard
creations-chat 2021-05-15 15:56:03 Opinion?
creations-chat 2021-05-15 16:00:21 True, that’s an issue that’s been plaguing me ever since I built it but rebuilding it would just force me to change a whole lot of other things too
help 2021-05-16 08:26:53 Hey guys, I’m using glitched mouse and when I try to roll to the right, it rolls but goes downwards and when I roll to the left, it rolls but goes upwards, how do I fix?
help 2021-05-16 08:27:22 Disconnecter motor lock is good
help 2021-05-16 08:32:24 Guys, I’m using glitched mouse and whenever I roll to the right, my plane goes downwards and when I roll to the left, my plane goes upwards and I don’t see any imbalance with my control panels
creations-chat 2021-05-16 16:36:58 <@!376309548761481217> dope bro better than mines
creations-chat 2021-05-16 16:39:47 Well duh, I’m planning on completely redoing the camo, changing the wings a bit, altering the nose, etc, thrusters is already changed
creations-chat 2021-05-16 16:42:03 Pictures a bit old, the thrusters have different colors and are angled downwards like they are supposed to
creations-chat 2021-05-16 16:47:12 <@!376309548761481217> which F4 are you making, F4c? Cuz I don’t think the canopy supposed to go downwards that much when you reach the back
creations-chat 2021-05-16 16:49:21 I only think the F4E was ugly, the other ones looked better
creations-chat 2021-05-16 16:51:47 Well yea, the F4E is ugly, F4C looked better
creations-chat 2021-05-16 16:54:24 Better but paint the slope going downwards at the back of the canopy the color of the camo instead of black
creations-chat 2021-05-16 16:58:11 <@!376309548761481217> something looks off with your F4 but I can’t put my finger on it, maybe the nose too short
creations-chat 2021-05-16 17:14:51 Nose cone too short
creations-chat 2021-05-16 17:40:04 Do side pic
creations-chat 2021-05-16 17:45:22 Nose cone needs to be longer by 1 block
creations-chat 2021-05-16 17:51:46 You that Ytber cheeem? Noice, I was the guy who said that your F4E had too short of a nose
creations-chat 2021-05-16 17:54:18 You are actually the reason why I built my F4 Phantom
creations-chat 2021-05-17 06:08:35 good engine but exposed motor lock, was it worth it, motor lock is barely noticeable from moderate distance
creations-chat 2021-05-17 06:10:39 F4C Phantom II, landing gear is scuffed
creations-chat 2021-05-17 06:14:02 yes, landing gear scuffed, rocket thruster a bit big but thats a sacrifice im wiling to make and camo is bad lol and more
creations-chat 2021-05-17 06:16:03 i would redo the camo but the colors the camo pics give me look so off
creations-chat 2021-05-17 06:24:54 worse than mines jeez
creations-chat 2021-05-17 06:34:18 struggles of finding the correct colors for my F4C

creations-chat 2021-05-18 14:41:12 But I don’t think I can apply due to the fact that I changed the car a lot already, let’s just hope this new version gets the same amount
creations-chat 2021-05-18 14:49:43 WIAT, I GOT TWO MECHS IN WHICH ONE OF THEM GOT 90 likes

creations-chat 2021-05-22 12:44:40 <@!663033851941093400> i mean, your dababy is cool but its not the best compared to others :/
creations-chat 2021-05-22 12:47:00 Bro, your isn’t relative either lol, yours would be the size of a van not a convertible bro
creations-chat 2021-05-22 12:49:06 Also, making it small isn’t excuse for bad detail, try using motor lock
creations-chat 2021-05-22 12:51:08 If you got the same response from everyone, then it probably wasn’t impressive
creations-chat 2021-05-22 12:53:34 I could build a better delorean with no motor lock lol
creations-chat 2021-05-22 13:51:27 Which one is the first one

creations-chat 2021-05-23 16:37:23 Barnzilla challenges your mech to an epic duel
creations-chat 2021-05-23 16:43:22 Aw come on, fine, to make this fair, I will be using MECHAGODZILLA instead, it has a high rpm shield that can prevent any enemy from attacking, it has eye lasers, belly button lasers, flame thrower nose, rocket finger, toe rockets, full 360 head rotation and self destruct, the only thing it should have but doesn’t is rainbow lasers and flight
creations-chat 2021-05-23 16:48:22 Good luck, it’s been shown to be able to confuse rockets by having the rockets lock on to it but have the rotation speed to cause it to be confused and just fly away, also and, if I unanchor while using the shield, I can propel myself into the air very quickly
creations-chat 2021-05-23 16:50:46 Besides, the shield is mainly used to just fling enemies and, your mechs don’t stand a chance because unlike your mechs, my mechaGodzilla gad some sweet jazz for its theme song
creations-chat 2021-05-23 16:53:17 Your canopies open? I use glitched mouse so I have to wait to enter my plane first before locking it lol
creations-chat 2021-05-23 16:58:35 Can someone just please appreciate the fact that the vents go outwards near the front like on the actual plane? I had to do some truly horrific things to get it like that,
creations-chat 2021-05-23 17:00:48 Enough with the fucking wings already jeez
creations-chat 2021-05-23 17:03:43 Wings this wings that, I get it, the wings are shit , nobody gives a fuck about the fuselage or anything else bru
creations-chat 2021-05-23 17:07:47 I’m one of the type of people who use war thunder like controls where you can control using but control surface and wasd and that causes the wings to look like utter shit but it doesn’t matter cuz it fucking flies good, it’s like gjsolos planes, they have fucking cheese graters for wings but his planes are probably some of the best at performance
creations-chat 2021-05-23 17:10:03 That shat shit looks like they strapped two rocket ships to the wings
creations-chat 2021-05-23 17:15:49 Am sorry unspeakable, I know you were new but this build is just , very, very ugly
creations-chat 2021-05-24 06:01:21 is this pitot tube good?
creations-chat 2021-05-24 06:08:15 probably not
creations-chat 2021-05-24 06:11:34 yea
creations-chat 2021-05-24 06:13:36 i think autocorrect changed it to pilot cuz of typo and it assumed that i was typing pilot
creations-chat 2021-05-24 06:22:22 canopy and nose could be improved, also, why use cutter when you can use pyramid wedge
creations-chat 2021-05-24 14:10:17 F4 and mig 21
creations-chat 2021-05-24 14:21:12 My f4c phantom II decent?
creations-chat 2021-05-24 14:23:28 What the hell
creations-chat 2021-05-24 16:48:24 No offense but the only top gear build you would be able to accurately build is Geoff
creations-chat 2021-05-25 04:13:25 is this good?
creations-chat 2021-05-25 04:15:35 is it good yes or no, stop nit picking and answer the question
creations-chat 2021-05-25 15:28:45 Would y’all say this is F4 phantom has improved?
creations-chat 2021-05-25 15:30:52 My F4 went from horrendous and ugly to pretty good
creations-chat 2021-05-25 16:00:03 Yea ik it’s old
creations-chat 2021-05-26 05:31:43 i remade my F4 Phantom wing
creations-chat 2021-05-26 08:01:23 Lol, the fact that I posted my f4 phantom right after another person posted theirs
creations-chat 2021-05-26 08:03:38 Bro, my first iteration of my f4 phantom was better than yours, I’m glad I posted my f4 after yours
creations-chat 2021-05-26 08:06:13 Lol, another person who can’t take harsh criticism
creations-chat 2021-05-26 08:10:24 If you learn to take this kinda of criticism, your builds can get marginally better like my f4 for example : wings are shit? No problem, I’ll fix it, Camo looks like the first time a toddlers ever picked up a crayola?no problem, I’ll re do it, the nose is shit and canopy is bad? No problem, I’ll fix it, intakes are crap? No problem I’ll fix it, if you are like this, your builds get a lot better, you may think our criticism is harsh and toxic but if you learn to listen to them, you’ll find out that they are often correct
creations-chat 2021-05-26 08:15:19 Holy shit, I just realized that the top photo of my f4 (the bad one) was made just 21 days ago
creations-chat 2021-05-26 08:17:37 I thought it was from at April 24th or something
creations-chat 2021-05-26 08:19:41 I thought I was just gonna spend like 4 days on my f4 then stop , kinda like my spitfire, and continue on cars and mechs but holy moly
creations-chat 2021-05-26 08:23:27 Did you use disconnectors for the nose, The disconnecters make it look less smooth, it makes the nose cone look out of place

creations-chat 2021-05-29 16:41:07 Is basically motors attached to a bunch of panels and when something rams into the panels, it causes the motors to move and make it look like a dent, it’s simple in concept but a bit more complex to actually make
creations-chat 2021-05-29 16:50:23 “Something wrong I can feel it”
creations-chat 2021-05-29 16:53:28 Not sure but doesn’t the car have a keybind to prevent that cuz the motors are powered and locked so when you just spawn, the motors are locked so they won’t move but when you press the key-bind, the motors unlock and will now move

help 2021-06-07 15:05:29 i learned that making the back of the plane heavy also works but its more intense since it flicks around immediatly

creations-chat 2021-06-10 13:47:37 its not photoshop, its just rope and lights
creations-chat 2021-06-10 13:58:41 Well, if the plane can do kulbit, cobras etc by having vented wings then I think it’s worth it <@!714878625484243101> , can’t add more wings or anything cuz then it ruins performance and then makes it bad at doing maneuvers, canards are thick so they don’t interfere with performance
creations-chat 2021-06-10 14:01:30 I thought of motor locking some wings in but when I tried, it made it so the plane was stable and couldn’t do any maneuvers <:nooo:787097964946259978>
creations-chat 2021-06-10 14:04:45 I use hybrid and glitch mouse not wasd alone, any more wings and the performance suffers, not only does the maneuvers get worse but the roll as well

creations-chat 2021-06-16 05:56:29 I’ll just stick to the 1x2 since 1x1 makes it look obese
creations-chat 2021-06-16 05:58:36 Just swapped it, looks fat as fuck
creations-chat 2021-06-16 06:05:49 Idk if it’s the angle of the image but the wings look fine to me bru, the wings used to be 1x2 but I changed it to 1x1 last week cuz ikfin said

bug-reports 2021-06-22 16:28:19 What part is yawing
bug-reports 2021-06-22 16:28:23 Is the front going right to left
bug-reports 2021-06-22 16:28:26 Or is the back
bug-reports 2021-06-22 16:28:44 Where vid
bug-reports 2021-06-22 16:29:56 Here’s how you fix it
bug-reports 2021-06-22 16:30:02 1 balance your plane more
bug-reports 2021-06-22 16:30:14 This means don’t put too much weight to the back
bug-reports 2021-06-22 16:30:25 And don’t leave all the thrust near the front
bug-reports 2021-06-22 16:30:41 And add more wing panels to the back
bug-reports 2021-06-22 17:29:03 This is my f22
bug-reports 2021-06-22 17:29:11 Btw

creations-chat 2021-06-30 13:56:54 thats cuz i made the canards a bit smaller and forgot to compensate with the wings
creations-chat 2021-06-30 14:07:31 i fix
creations-chat 2021-06-30 14:13:55 folding wings have purpose btw, the wings folded outwards is more maneuverable and better for aiming but the wings folded inwards is more stable for straight flight and is slightly faster
creations-chat 2021-07-01 07:38:53 Why do people love to sacrifice the looks of their Godzilla in order for it to move more, it looks terrible and I’d rather have it not move too much but look good

creations-chat 2021-07-06 07:51:27 There is no gradient tho, it’s just light grey and blue
creations-chat 2021-07-06 07:54:06 ?? There is no transition, the leading edge of the wing is light grey because that’s just the color of it, there is no transition, it just straight up goes from light grey to blue, on some, the leading edge is a darker grey from the rest of the wing but on some planes but on others it’s lighter
creations-chat 2021-07-06 07:58:12 The su57 does have interior but the glass cylinder canopy makes it hard to see the interior from the inside, tho, there’s not much besides seat and the stick
creations-chat 2021-07-06 09:26:31 my barney godzilla got upvotes much faster than my su57 lmao
creations-chat 2021-07-06 09:32:01 that bike looks sick tbh
creations-chat 2021-07-06 09:38:19 Give me upvote now !1!1!1 I use motor lock to put two blocks together, that means I’m skill and deserved upvote because motorlock sill !1!!!!
creations-chat 2021-07-06 09:42:51 there should be a new system where you need a specific level or something to downvote and upvote, like level 5 on mee6 or something, prevents new players from causing this exact shit
creations-chat 2021-07-06 09:48:16 real when a boat with a small amount of motorlock gets 130 upvotes when my su57 where the custom angling keybinds take over half the keyboard and where the canopy alone uses more motorlock than the entire boat itself cant break even 40 upvotes, ik its my own build but still

creations-chat 2021-07-06 10:37:33 we arent even saying the build is trash or anything, we just saying that it doesnt deserve that much upvotes because it 1. its not that accurate 2. doesnt take much effort or time to make it
creations-chat 2021-07-06 10:40:21 mass downvote is the easier way to balance the ratio, its harder to get 50 people to un upvote
creations-chat 2021-07-06 10:46:16 it had to do with the build quality dumbass, some peoples builds get 300 upvotes and we dont mass downvote it just cuz it has alot of upvotes. we downvote the boat because its not even that accurate, the windshield is incorrect and the hull shape is incorrect
creations-chat 2021-07-06 10:48:19 ok? the post is just saying that you should repost if you yourself downvoted the boat, when does it say that you should mass downvote it dumbass

creations-chat 2021-08-09 15:52:29 Bro 1. Your builds are subpar at best and none of them have gotten a positive upvote and downvote ratio 2. You randomly insult people with irrelevant topics which makes you more of an idiot 3. You’re so dense that it’s a miracle you haven’t imploded into a black hole yet

<@!780141543113228308> that’s a poorly made mig 21 lol

creations-chat 2021-09-03 07:04:03 its the weird canopy drop at the back,  the nose doesnt angle downwards, didnt specify which F4 he built, also judging by the nose and the little tip under the nose cone, its probably an F-4C but that doesnt have an pitot tube, the side intakes should be wider at the front than the back and shouldnt be a constant width
creations-chat 2021-09-10 13:28:56 Hard to fit everything into a 1 block tall car that is only wide as about 3 blocks
creations-chat 2021-09-10 13:31:03 Motor placement for custom angle is more strict cuz if the position of the motor relative to the block you try to rotate changes then the angle changes

creations-chat 2021-09-16 10:30:30 ya, once im done with it atleast, why you think the old one has sparklers, ima hide the sparklers in the improved version
creations-chat 2021-09-16 14:34:18 I improved my spitfire which is the first plane I made, the wings are angled it’s just kinda hard to tell (I’ll take a new one that’s easier to see the angle of tmr) left is improved right is original, what y’all think

bug-reports 2021-11-03 16:27:02 But if it’s over that, it won’t spawn in automatically when you join to prevent lagging

And 3. What is that thing
creations-chat 2022-01-06 14:45:04 It’s like mig 29, f35, super hornet, f16  and a gripen all rolled into one
Mig 29 and hornet are for those round wing parts next to the intake
F35 and gripen for the small Intake shape that goes inwards 
And gripen for the canopy <@!345527706340818944>
Actually it has f4 phantom intakes
creations-chat 2022-01-06 14:48:22 Wait no, f4 phantom intakes LOL
creations-chat 2022-01-06 14:52:59 Bad edit but yellow for super hornet/mig 29, black for gripen, green for phantom and blue for f16

creations-chat 2022-01-28 12:57:45 It pains me that i cant make the L3/33 move since the motorlock tower is bigger than the whole tank, a moving version is possible if you just wanna put a giant motorlock tower behind it and accept the exposed

<@!723940197456281640> a build that doesnt move at like 1 mph
creations-chat 2022-02-02 14:42:12 not really since i never posted glass version of my builds to creations mainly cuz theres no reason
creations-chat 2022-02-02 14:44:29 yea he prolly should lol, i wanna see normal builds again
creations-chat 2022-02-02 14:47:38 ima just delete my glass creations post lol
creations-chat 2022-02-02 15:03:46 didnt say i started the trend, i said i may have influenced it

that is a massive difference if you are trying to compare that
creations-chat 2022-02-02 15:07:38 anyways its still a pretty lame trend since it is just using the bucket feature on builds

its like when there was a dream build raid in creations
creations-chat 2022-02-03 01:09:00 My panzer 3 is disappointing cuz when you glass it, you barely get anything
bug-reports 2022-02-04 04:51:16 Rickje admitted that none of that was intentional, he even said not to shoot it or he’d have to force field everything
bug-reports 2022-02-04 04:52:13 You used to be able to destroy the house on the floating island
bug-reports 2022-02-04 04:52:21 Now it’s forcefielded

bug-reports 2022-02-05 01:51:42 If it’s regarding the destroying event items thing then that’s already a well known thing

creations-chat 2022-02-05 10:22:53 Wip panzer 3 turret that will replace the current turret for my panzer 3
creations-chat 2022-02-05 10:25:18 Ja
creations-chat 2022-02-05 12:33:13 Yo what your thoughts on my new panzer 3 turret, made it a bit more accurate to the shape of a real panzer 3 turret, also yea I know about the exposed motor and water sprayer
creations-chat 2022-02-05 12:35:15 Like ausf G, also barrel is short but that’s something I’ll fix when I’m back home
creations-chat 2022-02-05 12:37:38 Aight, barrel definitely will be improved but may be a bit difficult for cupola since it’s directly above the motorlock tower


Also that pic prolly isn’t a panzer 3 ausf G since that picture pops up whenever you search up any panzer 3 variant, pretty sure that’s an ausf h
creations-chat 2022-02-05 13:04:43 They’re transparent dummy
creations-chat 2022-02-05 13:10:42 That require tnt which I don’t wanna use and it’s too wide
creations-chat 2022-02-05 13:39:19 55mm which water jet would be too small and sparkler would be too big so I picked the medium which is gun

Also I don’t wanna use tnt until it’s usable in public so I can’t use tnt on stuff like jet engines to get s smaller cylinder
creations-chat 2022-02-06 14:23:28 New panzer 3 turret finally put on my panzer 3 hull

<@!740790456182636595> I already know that but a roscale panzer 3 is ugly as shit

creations-chat 2022-03-03 16:18:36 yo what do i improve on the is2
creations-chat 2022-03-03 16:25:57 hars still typing lmao
creations-chat 2022-03-03 16:34:33 the muzzle is the disconnector at the end, cant put much detail or it wouldnt be able to move, the is2 varient im making has a more angular hull front, external tanks are kinda weird so i can move the turret, the MG is there to hide motorlock and its sitting ontop of the motorlock tower so its difficult to add detail to it considering it also moves, the cupola is there its just that im sitting in it, track isnt smooth to prevent the track from sticking out of the gaurd like my sherman, the rest ill be sure to fix later, thanks for the feedback

cant add much to it considering the barrel moves, wish there was a way to motorlock stuff onto moving parts without making the motorlock a part of the moving piece
also front lower plate is flat cuz the real lower front plate has such a tiny angle and considering it could create more exposed motorlock, i decided that adding that would be a bit of a waste of time

creations-chat 2022-03-15 14:35:15 Ik its not practical and would take a lot of custom angle but I wish you made a smaller more flushed nose and a smoother canopy curve
creations-chat 2022-03-15 14:37:27 Right but even then, you should try to make a smaller nose with a smoother more round canopy since your harrier rn kinda looks like an F22 but ik it’s not practical and would be kinda ass to do
creations-chat 2022-03-15 14:47:49 You should try to make a panzer 4 or maybe a tank destroyer like the jagdpanther

creations-chat 2022-03-27 16:48:16 Jeez you seem to like hurling around insults any time anyone brings up the repost lmao, just the right bit of entertainment I needed before going to sleep I suppose
creations-chat 2022-03-27 16:50:32 You seem to care enough to call me a moron and offer to dm me in my native language and then reply to me, also I said repost 3 times which is exactly how many times you’ve posted it so I wasn’t wrong either
creations-chat 2022-03-27 16:52:37 Maybe next time don’t repost it or atleast change something in the build lol
creations-chat 2022-04-01 17:50:17 We are close mathematically since we base our measurements on roblox provided conversions but doing roscale gives you a quick realization of how tanks are actually quite small compared to like fighter jets

But if you are referring to the shit box “roscale” wannabe tanks that you see constantly in creations then yea you are right, doubt most of the people making those shit tanks even knows the 0.77 rule
creations-chat 2022-04-01 17:59:23 Ok so we agree since my roscale tanks or like the tanks you see in 14th actually try to be as close as possible using the roblox stud measurements.

While the tanks you see in creations are just noobs seeing our builds and band wagoning off of it and creating some of the most ugly shit I’ve seen and people encourage it by upvoting it for some reason
creations-chat 2022-04-02 15:11:20 yes, 2 wide roscale planes gang 😎, honestly i thought it was obvious that 2 wide was roscale
the-dump 2022-04-03 03:37:39 
creations-chat 2022-04-03 08:34:10 Cuz of our building of roscale tanks and then getting high upvotes encourages noobs to make roscale tanks as well
creations-chat 2022-04-03 08:46:34 Why y’all keep giving the wannabe roscale tanks a positive ratings you know if you wanna stop seeing these shitty wannabe roscale tanks then you have to downvote
creations-chat 2022-04-03 08:56:40 Creations have degraded so much that those tanks can be considered good 💀

creations-chat 2022-05-29 17:20:28 This was made way before the war thunder trailer, there is no unpainted motor on the wing and and the canopy color is like that so it doesn’t blend in with the darker color surroundings

creations-chat 2022-06-04 11:18:58 <@793132196810588200>
1. no hud frame
2. canopy frames should be colored black too but that depends on the livery
3. vertical stabilizers kinda basic
4. the whole shape of the canopy and nose isnt too accurate
5. whats with the exposed motorlock on the lerx
6. intake to nozzle transition isnt smooth
7. the hook part is too big
8. there shouldnt really be a gap between the missiles

you shouldnt have made it so small if you cant fix those problems then

creations-chat 2022-07-12 17:35:50 <@706947417576046692> that stug isn’t bad, I like that it has the actual correct shape, but add tank tracks and more detail, also more weathering and more realistic colors
creations-chat 2022-07-12 17:37:57 It’s not impossible to add tank tracks, I literally added tank track to every single one of my small tanks

<@448677698773057547> it’s better than having plain wheels, besides they can look good if people actually put effort into them and added detail but most people put no effort and just use disconnected or trapdoors or half blocks

<@706947417576046692> <@448677698773057547> some guy i know had suspension and fake tracks, just do a little editing on the build and you can have tracks and working suspension
creations-chat 2022-07-12 17:41:46 It’s not even that hard tho
creations-chat 2022-07-12 17:44:37 No? You can have decent looking tracks with suspension, you just right off the idea before even trying it
creations-chat 2022-07-12 17:56:13 This suspension with tracks took 5 minutes, built on Mobile with like barely any motorlock at all

For you it’d take shorter cuz it’s literally is as simple as adding some trapdoors below your wheels
creations-chat 2022-07-12 18:17:11 <@497829602664644608> Imagine a plane model in the game too lmao if that’s possible

<@839668493602652182> the build is too unsmooth, and the shape is off too, also needs more liveries.
<@967700242323615744> your Mario kart is too tall, it looks weird.
<@658071879881326642> your B11 is too thin and long, it looks like 2 sticks flying, the canopy and nose are off too
creations-chat 2022-07-18 18:15:48 Shitting on more builds!
<@775918490146177024> colors look like a csgo skin, give it a dark green or something.
<@400119068704636938> give the paint some weathering so it looks dirty and add some detail too cuz it’s really plain.
<@438684293217255424> the gun is way too thick, use sparklers instead, the whole base feels wrong, add details like the breach and stuff and fix the stands
<@803015783772979212> plane needs to be smoothened, also needs more detail and better larger variety of color
creations-chat 2022-07-18 18:18:19 Oh yea, another thing I forgot to mention, Mario kart doesn’t have windshields

creations-chat 2022-09-07 09:30:02 0.7 which means a cv is exactly 2 wide so 3 wide is too wide

@𝐑𝐖.𝐑𝐀𝐂𝐈𝐍𝐆ツ#4589 yea you said it’s 3 wide, 3 wide is too big for a CV since the WHOLE thing is 2 blocks wide
creations-chat 2022-09-07 09:32:36 It’s 1.4 meters wide INCLUDING the tracks so the whole thing needs to be 2 blocks wide

creations-chat 2022-09-07 10:12:00 <@670101431071801384> bros been typing for 10 minutes now
creations-chat 2022-09-07 10:14:52 a roblox character is 1.4 meters, people have already confirmed this way back and im pretty sure everyone measures by tracks considering thats the point of the tank that sticks out
creations-chat 2022-09-07 10:18:30 even if they were (they vary from 1.4 to 1.5 meters tall) does a 2 meter wide CV33 seem logical to you? a CV33 is 1.2 meters tall and blueprints show that the tank is barely wider than it is tall

<@670101431071801384> also yes we've been wasting our time
creations-chat 2022-09-07 10:22:09 its a difference of .5 studs, it wont make a difference considering how a CV33's 1.2 meter height is barely shorter than a CV33's width, if it were 2 meters wide, the CV33 would look alot more flat
creations-chat 2022-09-07 10:24:18 literally every source says 1.4 meters wide and 1.3 meters tall meaning it'd still be the same thing, are you seriously suggesting a CV35 is like 1.8 meters tall or something?
creations-chat 2022-09-07 10:27:26 yea and im saying your point is wrong, IF a CV35 was over 2 meters wide and was only a bit wider than the CV35 is tall, then the whole tank would be over 1.7 meters in height which it clearly isnt
creations-chat 2022-09-07 10:32:22 im saying if the tank was 2 meters wide, the height would have to be 1.7+ meters tall to be proportional considering how the width of the tank if flipped over would only be slightly tall than the height of the tank
creations-chat 2022-09-07 10:38:04 im not adding the height or anything, im saying how your measurement of if being over 2 meters wide is simply illogical based on the proportions of the tank.

in roscale a block is 0.70 meters and so 1.4 meters would be exactly 2 blocks, yours is 3 blocks wide, making the tank 2.1 meters wide, and assuming your tank is around 2.5 - 3 blocks tall based on the blocks shown of the tank, that means your tank is also around 1.7 meters tall making it not roscale
creations-chat 2022-09-07 10:45:33 you just arent understanding what i saying, ROBLOX OFFICIALLY RELEASED STUD CONVERSIONS, RICKJE OFFICIALLY CONFIRMED A BLOCK WAS 2.5 STUDS TALL, MAKING IT 0.70 METERS, your tank clearly isnt roscale considering how it is over 2.5 blocks tall making it 1.75 meters tall which goes back to what i said about your tank being massive, height does relate to this matter because of proportions, if it was 2 meters wide, then the tank HAS To be over 1.7 meters tall because of the proportions of the tank, the tank clearly isnt 1.7 meters tall, it is 1.2 meters tall meaning the hull is around 1.4 meters wide because of PROPORTIONS, DO YOU FUCKING UNDERSTAND THAT, this is a fucking waste of time

<@670101431071801384> yea, 2.5 blocks tall is 1.75 meters tall, which makes your CV oversized
creations-chat 2022-09-07 10:48:23 yea cuz mans saying a CV33/35 is over 2 meters wide
creations-chat 2022-09-07 10:59:07 look at this photo, notice how the tank flipped over is only slightly taller than the tank standing up? if the tank was 1.3 meters tall and the width was 2.3 meters wide, why is the width of the tank flipped over only barely taller than the height of the tank standing up, thats what ive been trying to say, the tank being 2.3 meters wide is simply not logical or proportional
creations-chat 2022-09-07 11:06:29 finally, this arguments been going for over an hour, ima go now
creations-chat 2022-09-07 23:52:57 The argument is already over, you’re replying to an argument that ended literally 9 hours before, also he specifically said my CV was too small and his CV was accurately sized, it’s not like he had his own scaling, im convinced y’all specifically scroll through hours of messages in creations feedback just to find some drama
creations-chat 2022-09-08 00:01:27 Yea it was excessive but I refuse to backdown when he said a CV33/35 is over 2 meters wide
creations-chat 2022-09-08 00:05:21 I’ll admit when I’m wrong because you always learn new stuff but no way is a CV33 over 2 meters wide, it just isn’t proportionally possible
creations-chat 2022-09-08 00:07:24 That’s what I said too but he said the 1.4 width measurement was the hull measurement and didn’t include the tracks 🗿💀
creations-chat 2022-09-08 09:28:36 .1 meter

creations-chat 2022-11-22 14:57:30 It’s mid, just that it’s the only one, my f-105 has the same situation, it’s alright compared to my phantom but it’s like the only decent f105
contest-chat 2022-11-22 14:59:08 I can but I don’t use it since it gets stuck everywhere and it’s tiny vibrations from the spring going back and forth as you lock it can cause piston and angle locking to mess up

creations-chat 2022-12-18 04:43:44 yea but taking a photo of your monitor doesn't replicate that
contest-chat 2022-12-18 16:56:29 HEY GUYS, I FINALLY FINISHES MY HELICOPTER FOR THE CONTEST!1
creations-chat 2022-12-19 07:40:48 kinda, yall cant tell but the front part also angles inwards slightly
creations-chat 2022-12-19 13:46:16 Nah, I like my cobra plain, I kinda explained that
creations-chat 2022-12-19 15:13:13 only early ones had it on the left, mines a mix of early and late cobra, early skids and late tail because i felt like it
creations-chat 2022-12-20 07:47:58 <@1002450692969070633> yea, you kinda are proving that they are ass
creations-chat 2022-12-20 07:55:40 jokes on you, it isnt from anime <:clueless:942802644043464734> also if your only argument is "Anime pfp" then you got skill issue
creations-chat 2022-12-20 08:03:20 seems you didnt care enough to make an argument for mini tanks either then
creations-chat 2022-12-20 08:06:47 thats fair, and im allowed to not like it, we are allowed to have opinions
creations-chat 2022-12-20 08:13:32 so im salty since i dislike a build because i dont like how it looks?
creations-chat 2022-12-20 08:22:34 I’ll start working on this again one day
creations-chat 2022-12-20 08:28:06 If you want, I could let you use the mantlet design I did for my tiger P, it’s an old design tho so maybe not
creations-chat 2022-12-20 08:30:16 yea, who else would that be
creations-chat 2022-12-20 08:32:19 you can do that with 4 wide since that turret is also 4 wide, my porsche tiger should be roughly the same scale and mostly the same turret except for maybe the roof
creations-chat 2022-12-20 08:38:38 its an anime livery, <:clueless:942802644043464734>
creations-chat 2022-12-20 09:41:57 yea and people always ask me to add the most ridiculous overcomplicated shit to my builds as if i can spare the pistons to do so, i pride myself in the fact that most of my builds can spawn relatively consistency with the exception being my Apache but that only uses 27 pistons
creations-chat 2022-12-20 11:21:32 The amount of cool and detailed stuff I could’ve created if pistons and motors weren’t so laggy, I have to limit a lot of details and so on because I can’t dedicated tons of pistons and motors just for small details since I use up all of them just for the shape

creations-chat 2022-12-21 18:47:56 It’d be 23 blocks long, the A10 is a pretty short plane,
creations-chat 2022-12-21 18:50:29 Yea but mathematically, an A10 would be 23 blocks, using your avatar to compare anything isn’t gonna work very well since they are basically fat children
creations-chat 2022-12-21 19:02:38 No, roscale is based on the fact that a stud is 0.28 meters according to roblox studio’s official measurements, and Rickje stating that a block is 2.5 studs, making a block exactly 0.7 meters and an A-10 being 16.16 meters or so long makes it 23 blocks long
creations-chat 2022-12-21 19:05:07 I’m basing mine off official roblox studio measurements which straight up converts studs to meters for you so 🤷‍♂️
creations-chat 2022-12-21 19:10:43 A block can’t fucking be 0.7 and 0.78 meters at the same time, this ain’t Schrödinger’s cat
creations-chat 2022-12-21 19:16:44 It’s not perfectly half the size of your character, it’s slightly shorter, you can confirm that a block is 2.5 studs by using pistons because their settings measure the distance in studs and setting the pistons to 2.5 studs makes it extend the exact length of 1 block
creations-chat 2022-12-21 19:22:26 Can we just agree that it’s 0.7 since it’s a much cleaner and reliable number than 0.78

creations-chat 2023-01-09 07:02:00 I delete a lot of my builds, since a lot of them become outdated, I find them ugly, too laggy or I don’t know how to use them anymore, some of my tanks or 1 wide planes are prolly gonna be deleted sooner or later, partially why I take alot of photos of my builds
creations-chat 2023-01-09 07:04:47 I often do regret deleting some builds, like my 2 wide phantom, yea it was outdated and wasn’t that good but I probably could’ve just fixed it, also it was still pretty much blueprint accurate, really just needed to smooth the engine part and stuff, eh I replaced it with my 3 wide phantom and it’s way better so it’s not all bad

creations-chat 2023-02-01 08:39:03 It does not make me a bad human being to express my honest thoughts on a build that I find to be less than alright because of my standards, people are allowed to have opinions on stuff, it’s like you said, it’s your choice to ignore it or not
creations-chat 2023-02-01 08:42:25 I could also say I see many flaws in you such as you having thinner skin than an apple, clearly you are the type to just go “didn’t ask” whenever someone says something you don’t wanna hear, also, go ahead, contact the staff, it ain’t against the rules to say someone’s build is bad.

<@658454424599003136> I never used it for combat but it’s a simple build so it could be used as one
creations-chat 2023-02-01 08:46:18 Just because I don’t kiss your ass whenever I critique your build doesn’t mean I’m being toxic, how about you have some thicker skin then
creations-chat 2023-02-01 09:27:05 Having fun arguing?
creations-chat 2023-02-01 20:56:00 Yea, cuz those rules have been followed

creations-chat 2023-02-01 21:03:30 If using the skull emoji and saying fuck was toxic, then literally even the head admin, mods, Rickje and every person here would be fucking banned 💀 💀💀

creations-chat 2023-02-28 13:55:36 atleast theres more than like 10 of them flying

not when the Su57 is barely stealthier than an F18

im not gonna have this bullshit argument again, the F16 still looks cooler and actually has kills, now ima go cuz creations chat arguments are a dumpster fire
creations-chat 2023-02-28 14:01:05 which aircraft has shot down more UFOs <:clueless:942802644043464734>
creations-chat 2023-02-28 14:04:43 i really dont care bro, the Su57 can be cool and whatever, F16 looks better in MY OPINION (also idc if its effective, Russia cant field any lol)

<@567763933952475157> hi, heard someone was mad trash talking and i was bored
creations-chat 2023-05-18 17:52:06 yea i kinda wanted to emphasized how clean the real life livery was, my other liveries were a bit better honestly like my bounty hunters
creations-chat 2023-05-18 18:01:55 that nuclearbeast guy was dogging on my Phantom right

<@567763933952475157> thats good to hear, honestly my phantom isnt that good, like ive said before, made in 3 days, its best part was the camo and shaping, otherwise its pretty bare bones since i was limited by lag
creations-chat 2023-05-18 18:04:12 I got tired of not being able to add cool details due to lag which is why i left PC
creations-chat 2023-05-18 18:14:49 looks pretty good so far

creations-chat 2023-06-19 16:00:30 Pcc and plane crazy in general has fallen off so hard honestly
creations-chat 2023-06-19 16:05:53 Occasionally check but always just end up on a downvote spree
creations-chat 2023-06-19 16:21:28 Wasnt paying attention to what the post said, just saw a shitty build and downvoted
