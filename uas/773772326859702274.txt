help 2022-11-03 18:49:39 HELP! When I rotate these pieces then explode the blocks to merge the layers together they just spasm everywhere how do the pros rotate pieces then lock and still have a functional vehicle?
help 2022-11-03 18:50:27 Also is there a way to get something as compact as explosion blocks but works in Non PVP mode as well? ( to lock after rotation )
