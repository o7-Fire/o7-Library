the-dump 2019-12-03 05:09:33 Number 15
the-dump 2019-12-03 05:09:39 Burger king foot lettuce
the-dump 2019-12-03 05:09:56 The last thing you’d want in your burger king burger is someone’s foot fungus
the-dump 2019-12-03 05:10:08 But as it turns out, that might be what you get
the-dump 2019-12-03 05:10:58 A 4channer uploaded a photo, anonymously to the site
the-dump 2019-12-03 05:11:08 Showcasing his feet in a plastic bin of lettuce
the-dump 2019-12-03 05:11:27 With the statement, “This is the lettuce you eat at burger king”.
the-dump 2019-12-03 05:11:53 Admittedly, he had shoes on.
the-dump 2019-12-03 05:11:57 But thats even worse
the-dump 2019-12-03 05:12:35 The post went live at 11:38pm on july 16
the-dump 2019-12-03 05:12:46 and mere 20 minutes later
the-dump 2019-12-03 05:13:08 The burger king in question was alerted to the rougue employee
the-dump 2019-12-03 05:13:35 At least, i hope his rogue. How did it happen?
the-dump 2019-12-03 05:15:29 Well the BK employee hadn’t removed the eixicifif data from the uploaded photo
the-dump 2019-12-03 05:15:52 Which suggested the culprit was somewhere in Mayfield Heights, Ohio
the-dump 2019-12-03 05:16:16 This was at 11:47
the-dump 2019-12-03 05:16:42 Three minutes later at 11:50, the burger king branch address was posted
the-dump 2019-12-03 05:16:56 with wishes of happy unemployment
the-dump 2019-12-03 05:17:50 Five minutes later, the news station was contacted by another 4channer

creations-chat 2019-12-13 05:24:30 Which germany
creations-chat 2019-12-14 22:25:50 Cameras can help to balance thin ships
creations-chat 2019-12-14 22:26:06 Though you may have to put a lot of them
the-dump 2019-12-20 13:38:09 Suppose that you were sitting down at this table. The napkins are in front of you, which napkin would you take?
the-dump 2019-12-20 13:38:24 The one on your ‘left’? Or the one on your ‘right’? The one on your left side?
the-dump 2019-12-20 13:38:25 Or the one on your right side?
the-dump 2019-12-20 13:38:44 Usually you would take the one on your left side. That is ‘correct’ too. But in a larger sense on society, that is wrong
the-dump 2019-12-20 13:39:03 Perhaps I could even substitute ‘society’ with the ‘Universe’.
the-dump 2019-12-20 13:39:14 The correct answer is that ‘It is determined by the one who takes his or her own napkin first.’
the-dump 2019-12-20 13:39:36 …Yes? If the first one takes the napkin to their right, then there’s no choice but for others to also take the ‘right’ napkin.
the-dump 2019-12-20 13:39:50 The same goes for the left. Everyone else will take the napkin to their left, because they have no other option.
the-dump 2019-12-20 13:40:05 This is ‘society’… Who are the ones that determine the price of land first? There must have been someone who determined the value of money, first.
the-dump 2019-12-20 13:40:18 The size of the rails on a train track? The magnitude of electricity? Laws and Regulations?
the-dump 2019-12-20 13:40:35 Who was the first to determine these things? Did we all do it, because this is a Republic? Or was it Arbitrary?
the-dump 2019-12-20 13:40:56 NO! The one who took the napkin first determined all of these things! The rules of this world are determined by that same principle of ‘right or left?’!
the-dump 2019-12-20 13:41:06 In a Society like this table, a state of equilibrium, once one makes the first move, everyone must follow!
the-dump 2019-12-20 13:41:18 In every era, this World has been operating by this napkin principle. And the one who ‘takes the napkin first’ must be someone who is respected by all.
the-dump 2019-12-20 13:41:31 It’s not that anyone can fulfill this role… Those that are despotic or unworthy will be scorned. And those are the ‘losers’.
the-dump 2019-12-20 13:41:45 In the case of this table, the ‘eldest’ or the ‘Master of the party’ will take the napkin first… Because everyone ‘respects’ those individuals.

creations-chat 2020-10-31 02:44:51 the saturn v, launcher platform, tower and crawler must all be in one plot or ill consider the entire apollo project a failure
creations-chat 2020-10-31 02:46:00 because i have to replicate the entire thing rolling out of the VAB in a timelapse which means everything must be in one piece
creations-chat 2020-10-31 02:48:02 i still have yet to build the entire VAB with at least one of the hangars having an interior, the mobile service structure and LC-39A
creations-chat 2020-10-31 02:51:42 Ill consider the apollo project complete once all of the pictures i sent are completely replicated
creations-chat 2020-10-31 02:53:16 Rebuild the current saturn v with the skylab version then lower the crew access arm and then rebuild the crawler launch platform and tower and add the milk stool and the saturn IB
creations-chat 2020-10-31 02:56:11 Once the apollo project is done ill proceed to make all 5 space shuttle orbiters and their differences and modify the launcher platform and build the service structures and recycle the VAB then once thats done ill build the spacex version of LC-39A with the new launch tower and the hanger used to store the boosters
