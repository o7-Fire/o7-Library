contest-chat 2022-08-19 01:55:09 booo, boring
contest-chat 2022-08-19 01:55:21 something that actually looks steampunk
contest-chat 2022-08-19 15:46:24 so does it have to be a steampunk version of something from the 20th century, or could you add a little fantasy to a build
contest-chat 2022-08-19 15:59:38 ah damn, I can still work with that
contest-chat 2022-08-19 19:38:10 tzar tank is already steampunk looking

creations-chat 2023-01-08 16:26:47 <@1061298559833608232> was that first one a joke submission I really can't tell, cause your second one actually didn't look half bad

Though some improvements might be to not make so much motor lock showing, and make the back flow better instead of just being a delta wing and a 1x1 wing <@848336285550772255>
creations-chat 2023-01-22 02:32:04 I did like how you did the front though
