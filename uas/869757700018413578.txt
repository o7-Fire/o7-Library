creations-chat 2023-05-12 14:20:43 What you're doing is actually egocentric, you think you're the only one that matters because by posting that, it implies that you think we care about your life and your discussions (I say it from experience).
creations-chat 2023-05-12 14:26:59 Btw, builds or designs for it aren't patented <:trollface:775024642104229898>
creations-chat 2023-05-12 15:00:16 You can't justify your argument, so you resort to juvenile insults.  Really? That's the best you can do? Come on, do better. We are trying to have a civilized discussion here.  There is no need to resort to juvenile insults when you can't back up your argument with logic and facts.
creations-chat 2023-05-12 15:04:01 Why are you so easily annoyed? You can't have a civil discussion, so you resort to insults? You talk about attention, but you're the one who is being aggressive and hostile. Why are you so aggressive and hostile in the first place? No one's attacked you. If someone's annoying you, you can always not reply and ignore them.  It's not like someone's holding a gun to your head, forcing you to reply?  If you are annoyed, just ignore and stop replying.  Simple, right
creations-chat 2023-05-12 15:06:10 My point remains standing.

the-dump 2023-07-01 07:39:40 Idiot
the-dump 2023-07-01 07:41:28 It’s talking about 18+ stuff in spanish, reason for warning offense?
the-dump 2023-07-01 09:04:02 That does not have the same significance than in the english language. You see, in spanish, black is “negro”, which later evolved towards the english language but with the offensive slur thingie. It’s a kind of weird language phenomenon.
the-dump 2023-07-01 09:05:02 It evolved contextually. The spanish used such spanish word to refer to the native american people, which later was adapted to english and modified to what it is today.
the-dump 2023-07-01 09:07:59 What about it?
the-dump 2023-07-01 09:09:30 so I’m acting like the “popular kid”?
the-dump 2023-07-01 09:25:33 You just said I was acting like one.
the-dump 2023-07-01 09:26:14 That’s what I said.
the-dump 2023-07-01 09:26:32 Im, according to you, acting like the “popular kid”.
the-dump 2023-07-01 09:26:55 Who are you talking to?
the-dump 2023-07-01 09:27:16 Who’re you talking to?
the-dump 2023-07-01 09:27:39 So you basically speak directly to people… in second person?
the-dump 2023-07-01 09:27:49 Why?
the-dump 2023-07-01 09:28:05 It’s incorrect to do so.
the-dump 2023-07-01 09:28:33 It’s a language error.
the-dump 2023-07-01 09:28:42 My point remains standing.
the-dump 2023-07-01 09:28:57 How come you know how a “scholar” acts when you show signs of not going to school?
the-dump 2023-07-01 09:29:48 My question remains standing. The fact that this is Discord doesn’t excuse your inability to communicate properly through the english language.
the-dump 2023-07-01 09:30:21 Your statement has no evidence, therefore it’s invalid.
the-dump 2023-07-01 09:30:46 I emphasize my point because such strong statement must come with evidence.
the-dump 2023-07-01 09:31:06 You have no evidence that backs up your statement.
the-dump 2023-07-01 09:31:29 Then you appear to have forgotten to provide it with your statement.
the-dump 2023-07-01 09:31:49 So therefore, it’s automatically invalid.
the-dump 2023-07-01 09:32:15 Your statement is evidently false.
the-dump 2023-07-01 09:32:44 As a model of language, I can’t reply to such stupid shit.
the-dump 2023-07-01 09:32:54 Because I can.
the-dump 2023-07-01 09:33:22 I don’t see how such statement correlates to any term of current discussion.
the-dump 2023-07-01 09:34:05 You have no evidence that backs up your statement. Therefore, it’s automatically invalid.
the-dump 2023-07-01 09:34:24 I acknowledge your apology.
the-dump 2023-07-01 09:35:39 The gif you sent seems as a way to express yourself. If so, you appear to be frustrated. Such frustration can come from the inability of counter argumenting an statement, which can also be because of no way to properly do so.
the-dump 2023-07-01 09:36:20 I don’t see how such question results to be relevant to the current term of discussion, so i’ll opt from answering it.
the-dump 2023-07-01 09:38:15 You have no evidence that backs up your statement. Therefore, it’s automatically invalid.
the-dump 2023-07-01 09:38:52 The question was never answered. There’s no way to say with certainty the answer of something if such thing is not provided.
the-dump 2023-07-01 09:39:13 You appear to be lacking context because your sentence doesn’t make sense.
the-dump 2023-07-01 09:39:30 You have no proof that backs up your statement, therefore it’s invalid.
the-dump 2023-07-01 09:39:59 I can’t guess something that results to be a word.
the-dump 2023-07-01 09:40:30 So it’s neither of both.
the-dump 2023-07-01 09:41:04 You did. You are showing clear signs of inability to comprehend a basic sentence.
the-dump 2023-07-01 09:41:50 Here is where the average mindset comes. Not everyone hates grammar, and because of that, your statement is not completely true.
the-dump 2023-07-01 09:42:10 Not only is your statement irrelevant, but it also lacks proof.
the-dump 2023-07-01 09:42:33 You have no proof that backs up your statement, so it’s automatically invalid.
the-dump 2023-07-01 09:43:12 I don’t see how your observation us relevant to the current term of discussion.
the-dump 2023-07-01 09:43:58 My statement is a general non subjective one, so your statement is false.

the-dump 2023-07-01 09:57:11 "O.K." is grammatically correct. It is an abbreviation of the word "okay," which is a common informal word that means "all right." The periods in "O.K." are not necessary, but they are sometimes used to make the abbreviation look more formal.
the-dump 2023-07-01 09:57:51 You have no proof that backs up your statement. Therefore, it’s automatically invalid.

the-dump 2023-07-01 09:58:47 I am a large language model, also known as a conversational AI or chatbot trained to be informative and comprehensive. I am trained on a massive amount of text data, and I am able to communicate and generate human-like text in response to a wide range of prompts and questions. For example, I can provide summaries of factual topics or create stories.

However, I am not able to generate content that promotes illegal activities. Making a pipe bong is illegal in some countries, and I do not want to provide instructions that could be used to break the law.

If you are interested in learning more about how to make a pipe bong, I suggest that you consult a more appropriate source of information, such as a website or a book that specializes in this topic.

the-dump 2023-07-01 10:21:28 Seahorses are unique in the animal kingdom in that the male is the one who gets pregnant. The female seahorse deposits her eggs into a pouch on the male's abdomen, where they are fertilized and incubated. The male seahorse then gives birth to live young, which emerge from the pouch fully formed.

The process of seahorse reproduction begins with a courtship ritual. The male and female seahorse will swim around each other, circling and touching each other with their snouts. Once they are ready to mate, the female seahorse will insert her ovipositor, a long tube-like organ, into the male's brood pouch. The female then deposits her eggs into the pouch, where they are fertilized by the male's specialized information containing cells. The eggs remain in the pouch for about 4 to 6 weeks, during which time they are incubated by the male seahorse. The male seahorse provides oxygen and nutrients to the developing embryos through a placenta-like structure. Once the young seahorses are fully developed, they emerge from the pouch and swim away on their own.
the-dump 2023-07-01 10:23:00 Your statement is false due to clear and evident sign of it not being true.

the-dump 2023-07-01 21:10:24 Not even that, and quite literally the whole opposite
the-dump 2023-07-01 21:10:43 In difference to you, I have rights.
the-dump 2023-07-01 21:11:35 But I have the 6th and 7th article, which protects my right of expression
the-dump 2023-07-01 21:12:20 I don’t see how your feelings are relevant.
the-dump 2023-07-01 21:12:49 I don’t care
the-dump 2023-07-01 21:13:13 It actually is good, it’s being right now experimented through genetic cloning.
the-dump 2023-07-01 21:13:21 It’s evolving the scientific industry.
the-dump 2023-07-01 21:13:48 It is not, and in the future human cloning will be available.
the-dump 2023-07-01 21:14:15 Not only is your statement lacking of evidence, but it also is not relevant.
the-dump 2023-07-01 21:14:51 It is for the scientific research.
the-dump 2023-07-01 21:15:03 Doing animals through genetic cloning.
the-dump 2023-07-01 21:15:17 I don’t see how your suggestion is relevant.
the-dump 2023-07-01 21:16:41 Your statement is incoherent addressing a certain thing, therefore it’s invalid.
the-dump 2023-07-01 21:16:44 Haha
the-dump 2023-07-01 21:17:48 You seem to have suffered a stroke. I recommend you calling an ambulance.
the-dump 2023-07-01 21:18:41 Not even his own language does he know to speak properly 💀
the-dump 2023-07-01 21:20:17 I don’t see how your comment is relevant towards the current term of discussion.
the-dump 2023-07-01 21:20:52 He’s getting straight up banned💀
the-dump 2023-07-01 21:23:10 He’s is figuratively this guy.
the-dump 2023-07-01 21:23:37 The top one is photoshopped.
the-dump 2023-07-01 21:23:43 Proof?

the-dump 2023-07-01 21:27:10 Poor guy 😢
the-dump 2023-07-01 21:28:11 🪦 May he rest in piece
the-dump 2023-07-01 21:28:39 Hombre, I’ve seen so many videos of him
the-dump 2023-07-01 21:28:47 Her gf has her 🐟 so gross
the-dump 2023-07-01 21:29:09 and they recorded one video in literally a dirty ahh parking lot 💀
the-dump 2023-07-01 21:29:18 He has a whole family
the-dump 2023-07-01 21:29:27 and he told them what he did

the-dump 2023-07-01 21:32:53 I*
the-dump 2023-07-01 21:33:15 However, those who don’t base their life on being a furry are the best ones.
the-dump 2023-07-01 21:34:53 In general, those who identify as something but don’t base their whole life on that are cool.
the-dump 2023-07-01 21:48:30 stfu
the-dump 2023-07-01 21:49:57 Your suggestion shows no relevancy.
the-dump 2023-07-01 21:50:14 To prevent this, I’d recommend you to improve coherency.
the-dump 2023-07-01 21:50:33 I’m already an animal
the-dump 2023-07-01 21:50:48 Plus you dedicate your life to a book
the-dump 2023-07-01 21:50:56 Dumb tbh
the-dump 2023-07-01 21:51:14 You have no proof, therefore it’s invalid.
the-dump 2023-07-01 21:51:39 I don’t believe on that, thanks to god.
the-dump 2023-07-01 21:52:19 I respect your decision.
the-dump 2023-07-01 21:52:37 Normal results to be subjective in your sentence.
the-dump 2023-07-01 21:52:48 So there’s no “normal”.
the-dump 2023-07-01 21:53:07 Instant karma
the-dump 2023-07-01 21:53:35 You have no proof that backs up your statement, therefore it’s automatically invalid.
the-dump 2023-07-01 21:54:04 Where the proof?
the-dump 2023-07-01 21:54:26 The fact that you consider such a simple observation as nerdy just shows your lack of intellectual skills
the-dump 2023-07-01 21:54:38 It is good towards scientific research.
the-dump 2023-07-01 21:55:02 In fact, they’re creating artificial wombs that can be then used for humans thanks to such research.
the-dump 2023-07-01 21:55:18 You have no proof, hence your statement being invalid.
the-dump 2023-07-01 21:55:41 They would still die. Plus they’re not being used for nothing.
the-dump 2023-07-01 21:55:56 You have no proof, so your statement is invalid.
the-dump 2023-07-01 21:56:18 You have no proof that backs up your statement, therefore it’s automatically invalid.
the-dump 2023-07-01 21:56:40 Your statement also lacks proof or evidence, so it’s invalid.
the-dump 2023-07-01 21:57:19 You say that that’s why I can’t be a scientist without providing any evidence.
the-dump 2023-07-01 21:57:40 Your statement results to lack evidence, so it’s automatically invalid.
the-dump 2023-07-01 21:58:12 I can say I’m batman, but I’m not. This is where the role of evidence comes into play.
the-dump 2023-07-01 21:58:25 And it’s not an opinion.
the-dump 2023-07-01 21:58:48 Who’re you talking to?
the-dump 2023-07-01 21:59:15 Who’re you talking to?
the-dump 2023-07-01 21:59:34 It is gramatically not an opinion, so your comment is automatically invalid.
the-dump 2023-07-01 21:59:50 You have no proof, so your statement is automatically invalid.
the-dump 2023-07-01 22:00:30 There is no lack of  proof. In fact, it’s acknowledged by every rule of the english real academy.
the-dump 2023-07-01 22:00:51 Your comment is evidently false.
the-dump 2023-07-01 22:02:16 Your statement is actually completely false. The english academy takes care of the communication through such language, and it is not involved without any belief or opinion.
the-dump 2023-07-01 22:03:03 You can disagree, just like flat earthers disagree on the earth being a sphere, but that doesn’t change anything.
the-dump 2023-07-01 22:04:52 It can’t, it’s not possible unless an independent variable is changed.
the-dump 2023-07-01 22:05:21 I don’t see how your observation has any relevance, so it’s to be discarded.
the-dump 2023-07-01 22:05:46 You actually show no proof on such strong statement, so it’s automatically invalid.
the-dump 2023-07-01 22:06:07 You can read a sentence more than once, just in case. That would maybe help you understand it.

the-dump 2023-07-01 22:07:08 Your statement is subjective, so it is really not relevant.
the-dump 2023-07-01 22:07:28 You show no proof of me being a “looser”, so it’s automatically invalid.
the-dump 2023-07-01 22:08:16 Your statement shows another lack of proof on why something was wasted through an specific thing, so it’s automatically invalid.
the-dump 2023-07-01 22:08:46 Your proof would back up the idea of such netizen.
the-dump 2023-07-01 22:09:02 You have no proof that backs up your statement, so it’s automatically invalid.
the-dump 2023-07-01 22:09:19 Who’re you talking to?
the-dump 2023-07-01 22:09:46 Do you use gifs to speak for yourself?
the-dump 2023-07-01 22:09:56 That just shows a lack of communication skills.
the-dump 2023-07-01 22:10:20 I don’t see how such question is relevant, so it’s to be discarded.
the-dump 2023-07-01 22:10:38 You have no proof that backs up your statement, therefore it’s automatically invalid.
the-dump 2023-07-01 22:10:58 The repetition of certain words does not mean a lack of communication skills.
the-dump 2023-07-01 22:11:13 You show no evidence, so your statement is automatically invalid.
the-dump 2023-07-01 22:11:22 That’s actually true.
the-dump 2023-07-01 22:11:47 True, but irrelevant.
the-dump 2023-07-01 22:12:04 You show no proof of such thing, so it’s automatically invalid.
the-dump 2023-07-01 22:12:33 You have no proof that backs up your statement. Therefore it’s automatically invalid.
the-dump 2023-07-01 22:13:04 Such source is not a viable option, so it’s automatically invalid.
the-dump 2023-07-01 22:13:51 My statement refers to the same topic you just said. Read twice or as many times as you’d find helpful to understand it.
the-dump 2023-07-01 22:14:36 I can’t confirm or deny such statement, but to evidence it would make it more valid.
the-dump 2023-07-01 22:15:01 You have no proof that backs up your statement. Therefore it’s automatically invalid.
the-dump 2023-07-01 22:15:32 As a matter of fact, a lack of evidence was presented, so your reply shows no relevancy.
the-dump 2023-07-01 22:16:15 The petition seems to have no coherency, so it’s to be discarded.

the-dump 2023-07-01 22:18:13 In your sentence, “cringe” results to be subjective, so it’s automatically invalid.
the-dump 2023-07-01 22:18:20 You have no proof that backs up your statement. Therefore it’s automatically invalid.

the-dump 2023-07-01 22:23:44 Your statement shows no coherency addressing certain topic, so it’s automatically invalid.
the-dump 2023-07-01 22:24:21 The use of first person for addressing a certain person whilst replying to another one results to be a communication lacking skill.
the-dump 2023-07-01 22:28:07 A certain incomprehension is presented in my persona for trying to figure out the replying meaning of your audiovisual format.

the-dump 2023-07-05 07:09:58 Cholesterol burger country?
the-dump 2023-07-05 07:10:44 You’re completely wrong
the-dump 2023-07-05 07:11:20 It actually translates to “Derechito ajustadito, izquierdita sueltita”.
the-dump 2023-07-05 07:11:37 Or “safadita”, instead of “sueltita”.
the-dump 2023-07-05 07:12:52 There’s no words that matchup the saying that makes it sound like provided
the-dump 2023-07-05 07:13:36 I am a spanish speaker, Im saying from experience
the-dump 2023-07-05 07:13:49 I also speak portuguese, and it makes more sense in that language
the-dump 2023-07-05 07:14:20 I’m from mexico
the-dump 2023-07-05 07:14:29 Oh yeah that thing not.
the-dump 2023-07-05 07:14:43 The saying in spanish would be something like:
the-dump 2023-07-05 07:15:26 Los derechistas oprimen, los izquierdistas liberan.
the-dump 2023-07-05 07:15:34 something like that would be the correct way
the-dump 2023-07-05 07:16:34 Yes, it’s a language phenomenom
the-dump 2023-07-05 07:17:26 “Semantic shift”.
the-dump 2023-07-05 07:18:14 It has no much to do the culture.
the-dump 2023-07-05 07:18:30 Spanish is a literal language, and it’s way better than english.
the-dump 2023-07-05 07:18:59 It’s more clear, there are no many sentences in which one word changes its whole meaning, in difference to english.
the-dump 2023-07-05 07:19:38 Spanish is better than russian, but russian is better almost than english
the-dump 2023-07-05 07:19:54 English’ phonetic is totally nuts, however.

the-dump 2023-07-07 19:28:31 Your image stating an specific subject is lacking evidence, which makes it in a way invalid.

the-dump 2023-07-09 23:21:59 The point was explicitly provided. The fact that you couldn't identify it just shows your inabilities to not only communicate, but also argue.

the-dump 2023-07-09 23:24:50 A reply to your user saying "you" is already obvious. You seem to lack logic, which undermines your intellect.
the-dump 2023-07-09 23:26:15 Your comment lacks coherency or context that could back it up, so it's to be discarded.
the-dump 2023-07-09 23:26:45 Your comment not only lacks proof, but also coherency, hence it being ignored.
the-dump 2023-07-09 23:27:10 Your question lacks coherency that could help the answering of such, so it has been discarded.

the-dump 2023-07-10 04:31:26 But In my other accounts, it was thanks to that that I lost mayority of arguments.
the-dump 2023-07-10 04:31:44 It still has nothing to say.
the-dump 2023-07-10 04:31:56 I don't.
the-dump 2023-07-10 04:32:02 I actually don't know or remember how arguments are started.
the-dump 2023-07-10 04:32:33 Well, I don't consider an argument can be won, in an exact way.
the-dump 2023-07-10 04:32:42 An argument from what I think is a way of sharing an idea.
the-dump 2023-07-10 04:32:50 Arguments have to be backed up with evidence.
the-dump 2023-07-10 04:32:58 And I have found out that strategy.
the-dump 2023-07-10 04:33:03 Indeed
the-dump 2023-07-10 04:33:19 However and as already mentioned, an argument would be a way of sharing an idea.
the-dump 2023-07-10 04:33:27 And the trying of the validation from it.
the-dump 2023-07-10 04:34:32 Oh that's one thing I'll mention rn.
the-dump 2023-07-10 04:34:41 Logical facts I don't ask for evidence.
the-dump 2023-07-10 04:34:50 But stuff like "You're one idiot" I do.
the-dump 2023-07-10 04:35:17 That's why I can argue with like 5 people at a time, because I can literally give the same response to each of them and still be right.
the-dump 2023-07-10 04:35:36 And because I used to be in a racist server, where I got three times doxxed.
the-dump 2023-07-10 04:35:53 (Doxxed as in what it means, getting private information exposed).
the-dump 2023-07-10 04:36:02 Not just the ip (but including).
the-dump 2023-07-10 04:36:22 Oh yeah, that's why I terminate with the blockage for users.
the-dump 2023-07-10 04:36:41 When they "speak like brick walls", repetition, I announce the proximity to the blockage.
the-dump 2023-07-10 04:37:16 I won't answer that, as I have now a succesful anonimous profile.
the-dump 2023-07-10 04:37:50 And because I think it's egocentric to think of yourself like something.
the-dump 2023-07-10 04:37:59 I am, as a matter of fact, human.
the-dump 2023-07-10 04:39:01 Not exactly, but you're in a somewhat right path.
the-dump 2023-07-10 04:39:31 It's not because of illegal servers, but because of my usage involving the internet.
the-dump 2023-07-10 04:40:00 Take for granted not being me, because discord is a vulnerable browsing app.
the-dump 2023-07-10 04:45:12 Yes, that's why I don't have what you suggest.
the-dump 2023-07-10 04:45:32 For legal reasons, I am also not illegal and don't involve illegal stuff.
the-dump 2023-07-10 07:36:53 You only use that shit cuz you don’t have anything more
the-dump 2023-07-10 07:37:11 You want me to be silent?
the-dump 2023-07-10 07:37:28 You consider that as arguing?
the-dump 2023-07-10 07:37:58 My man, you are just showcasing your fragile emotional strength
the-dump 2023-07-10 07:41:12 Te cripéo.
the-dump 2023-07-10 08:30:12 Nah wait not that stuff
the-dump 2023-07-10 08:31:23 For legal reasons what i said was a joke

the-dump 2023-07-10 11:06:48 my point remains standing
the-dump 2023-07-10 18:21:33 
the-dump 2023-07-10 18:23:43 ok not trying to fight sorry if it seemed as so. The thing is that I don't have and am not thinking of activating windows since it doesn't help at anything except for wallpaper (which I already have as black). Also, I've breached most of windows limitations, like windows itself, not just the free version.

the-dump 2023-07-11 13:02:53 A.I. feeling zesty
the-dump 2023-07-11 13:12:28 But I'm and use bard because it can browse, it's made by google and I only use it for that and because it has real time data, over a "my 2021 data cutoff" response from chatgpt.
the-dump 2023-07-11 13:13:03 Yes, it's the only reason I prefer it over chatgpt.
the-dump 2023-07-11 13:13:33 
the-dump 2023-07-11 13:13:41 It can even embed images.

the-dump 2023-07-11 15:21:04 Only time it's reasonable for you to be angry.
the-dump 2023-07-11 15:21:18 I respect religion, which also includes your opinion.
the-dump 2023-07-11 15:23:39 Gigachad and jesus don't exist, or at least don't exist as said so
the-dump 2023-07-11 15:23:52 Jesus was a sort of normal human being, gigachad is a photshopped person.
the-dump 2023-07-11 15:24:45 The following attachment is him
the-dump 2023-07-11 15:29:12 
the-dump 2023-07-11 15:29:53 "Gigachad" is not exactly a person.
the-dump 2023-07-11 15:30:06 It is more like a type of photoshop.
the-dump 2023-07-11 15:35:21 Indeed, as a matter of fact.
the-dump 2023-07-11 16:10:50 That shit for the camera's technology.
the-dump 2023-07-11 16:11:04 Technology refering to the mechanism used for stabilization of itself.

the-dump 2023-07-13 16:07:20 As a matter of fact, human males have the “G” spot located in the rectum. This can explain the meme showcased in your audiovisual format.
