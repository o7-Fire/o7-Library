bot-central 2021-03-22 11:23:39 &suggest Window builder tool
Building category
Builds a window, that can be configured. The window has a black outline(can be turned off) 
Can be very useful in building plane windows, and also capable of replacing some of the missing wedges
How it works: for example you built a nice learjet 45, and now building the windows
You made two studs wide windows for the passengers, and want them to see the water. With basic glass the water will not be visible. With legacy, the glass overlaos and doesn't look so good. Here comes this tool: simply click all the edges, where the glass should be, and press enter. The thin solid glass will appear. It doesn't overlap, and looks good. Also with the cabin. The learjet cabin has fairly complicated shapes, and can not be replicated without half triangles and other wedges. This tool also can help here, increasing the space for pilots, and making the plane look better with black outline on windows
