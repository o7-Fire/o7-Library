help 2021-07-01 19:31:35 Is gravity slider worth it?
help 2021-07-01 19:32:05 What would you even use it for?

help 2021-07-01 19:50:01 I’m aware of all the things you can do with motor locking but I just can’t find a reason to use it
help 2021-07-01 19:57:28 Could you use it to take a piston and move it diagonally? As seen on this Climax.

bug-reports 2021-08-02 19:01:37 Why are sometimes words censored and other times they aren’t despite the words being the same word
bug-reports 2021-08-02 19:04:24 And why are some of the most vague and basic words censored
bug-reports 2021-08-02 19:16:28 How’s it roblox’s fault
bug-reports 2021-08-02 19:16:48 In literally any other game where you can write something down the hashtag system isn’t nearly as cruel
bug-reports 2021-08-02 19:17:08 I can’t even type out names without them getting tagged
bug-reports 2021-08-02 19:19:01 The name “Belle Delphine” is 100% fine to put on a sign but the name “George” that name is bad apparently
bug-reports 2021-08-02 23:17:47 If that’s true how come I can type in George literally anywhere else and it isn’t tagged
bug-reports 2021-08-02 23:18:07 Last time I checked you got safe chat if your account was under 13, and my account is well over that
bug-reports 2021-08-03 18:52:02 Or maybe because plane crazy signs are problematic?
bug-reports 2021-08-03 18:52:08 Ever go about it that way?
bug-reports 2021-08-03 18:53:07 Tf do you mean “ask roblox” if you just admitted to the fact that it is indeed the signs that are the problem and not roblox
bug-reports 2021-08-03 18:58:41 You aren’t making much sense, you fucking moron
bug-reports 2021-08-03 18:58:47 Are you incapable of reading
bug-reports 2021-08-03 18:59:04 If it is roblox, why are you allowed to say the censored words anywhere else?
bug-reports 2021-08-03 18:59:18 You aren’t answering the question
bug-reports 2021-08-03 18:59:24 All you’re doing is calling me a dumb ass
bug-reports 2021-08-03 18:59:36 Even with safechat on
bug-reports 2021-08-03 18:59:43 Most of the censored words you can still say
bug-reports 2021-08-03 19:00:50 lol
