creations-chat 2021-01-16 23:41:06 Wait it’s has duo rotors and still have a tail rotor, how. The tail rotor is used to cancel torque. But when u have dubble blades, u cancel the torque so u don’t need a tail rotor, which can be seen on for example the chinook or the ka 50/52. or he could just use the tail rotor as a yaw controller. but that’s not either needed in that case

creations-chat 2021-07-21 16:21:09 <@!711009848438947850> I think u should replace that jet engine with a big water engine, because it’s more hollow. And the a7 usually has a round nose. Otherwise that looks great! And respect to your grandpa 👍

creations-chat 2021-09-16 14:33:21 nah, you are just ignorant. you are trying to get him blacklisted for posting his plane. hes may have "reposted" it, but not in matters that can blacklist him or whatever. he showed his carrier before not the a7, the a7 was in the frame but thats beyond the point.
creations-chat 2021-09-16 14:35:27 i think he knows the rules just as good. so being a little police wont help, also there is moderators and admins in this server <:PepeLaugh:697130830081818634>

creations-chat 2022-05-26 12:59:51 <@736224154105151569> nice creation but bro 💀
creations-chat 2022-05-26 13:15:51 take a great old guess
creations-chat 2022-05-26 13:20:05 yeah but are the decals really needed for the state of the world rn, u can keep the colors ofc maybe even a russian flag but the "в украину и обратно" and "слава россии" idk. im not saying u are glorifying or like supporting it, because u said u didnt. but its still a bit cringe/it feels wrong lmao
creations-chat 2022-05-26 13:22:11 i made an obviously russian tank but i didnt go all out making it the ultimate commie machine 💀

creations-chat 2022-05-26 20:55:56 <@770764150048948224>amazing build but the the actual plane looks goofy ahh 

<@393679134779375616> the cockpit and nose of his is small as
creations-chat 2022-05-26 20:58:27 the u7 is more like f18, but his looks like a funky mig 27, its a great build but could be better (f16 cockpit, f18 body kinda)
