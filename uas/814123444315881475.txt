the-dump 2021-06-26 15:58:33 would you rather listen to an epic song about warfare, with artillery strikes and flammenwerfer, or listen to some guy rhyme and flex that he has cash, and does stuff in his bedroom

creations-chat 2021-07-24 17:34:27 can people please tell me whats wrong with my plane, so i can improve it
creations-chat 2021-07-24 17:36:36 is that it, or is there more?
creations-chat 2021-07-24 17:41:43 the details part is gonna be hard, as all of my previous planes have been purely made for their ability, and with minor design in mind, but for all of the non texture changing parts, i have a paint color for those parts
creations-chat 2021-07-24 17:44:18 ok
creations-chat 2021-07-24 17:48:07 all that really matters to me for that is the weight, the ability for it to work, how effective it is, and how fast it is, for example i have a really ugly overall plane thats perfect for killing shredders, but anything else, its too fast
creations-chat 2021-07-24 17:51:23 <@!675296756703035393> fuck you, giving me false hope
creations-chat 2021-07-24 19:05:42 ik
creations-chat 2021-07-24 19:07:45 a terribly built plane, clearly
creations-chat 2021-07-24 19:10:19 ye ima try to make a terribly built helicopter
creations-chat 2021-07-24 19:12:28 i will be the only person on this server who wants all of their creations to have more downvotes than upvotes
creations-chat 2021-07-24 19:17:37 i literally did everything i know how to do for that build, but i guess the community is toxic, all they say is "put more effort into your build"
creations-chat 2021-07-24 19:19:41 but i guess im simply not good enough
creations-chat 2021-07-24 19:24:57 who said i was crying? all the community says is "Put more effort", basically saying get good lol
creations-chat 2021-07-24 19:27:46 doesnt mean im crying does it?
creations-chat 2021-07-24 19:30:32 tbh i just wish people would stop saying "get good lol" or "put more effort", because you are giving them a very unspecific task, actually give tips, and i see the "get good lol" people as toxic
help 2021-07-24 19:36:25 how does motorlock even work?
help 2021-07-24 19:37:34 finally a tip from you
creations-chat 2021-07-24 20:14:51 <@!564140400412065804> for what you were trying to do, i would say its perfect
creations-chat 2021-07-24 20:17:17 mine is mostly a joke, gun boat, but instead of it being big, its an actual boat
creations-chat 2021-07-24 21:10:02 i think my gunboat was ok, but hey, im winning in the end, i want more downvotes than upvotes
creations-chat 2021-07-25 01:58:47 if the bar is set super high, how is it my fault
