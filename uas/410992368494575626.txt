plane-crazy 2020-06-19 00:31:31 Flat Bottomed Boats
plane-crazy 2020-06-19 00:31:13 Funny thing is, this is my alt, but I guess on here it's my main. Also yeah pretty circular
plane-crazy 2020-06-19 00:30:19 Aight prolly later on
plane-crazy 2020-06-19 00:30:00 Cuz it's funny lol
plane-crazy 2020-06-19 00:29:42 Someone should post a tutorial Raptor in creations for downvotes
plane-crazy 2020-06-19 00:28:44 <:4Weird:709084058721714324>
plane-crazy 2020-06-19 00:27:34 Also about the cockpit, there's no way to truly make it circular so just make it look as circular as possible
plane-crazy 2020-06-19 00:26:50 Pretty damn good! The railing looks pretty nice.
plane-crazy 2020-06-19 00:26:05 Me no liek holz
plane-crazy 2020-06-19 00:25:59 Hybrid is good, but it tends to look ugly for planes in this game
plane-crazy 2020-06-19 00:24:32 Hm you got a point. Also I like mouse control for PvP, it helps me adjust my shot before I fire, otherwise I hate it
plane-crazy 2020-06-19 00:23:16 You may have to use key controls for em tho
plane-crazy 2020-06-19 00:23:03 Motorized/custom panels are always way more effective at turning and tend to look better if you want that smooth surface look
plane-crazy 2020-06-19 00:21:51 Go for it bro
plane-crazy 2020-06-19 00:21:31 It literally consumes me with nothing but pure and sheer RAGE to see that ugly mess of assorted wasted space fly
plane-crazy 2020-06-19 00:20:54 I godamn hate that raptor with a passion
plane-crazy 2020-06-19 00:20:30 
plane-crazy 2020-06-19 00:20:27 Look at my original creation! It looks so much better than anything you guys could make XDxD hahahaha

plane-crazy 2020-05-15 16:48:08 <@428948212225933312> I see a lot of improvements that could be done do it, but it isn't necessarily too much. I'd be glad to help with it later on
plane-crazy 2020-05-15 16:42:38 <@428948212225933312> you could try to increase the length of the nose :-) it doesn't look too bad as of now though. And maybe some custom motorized panel controls.

plane-crazy 2020-05-08 06:06:34 <@305085826604204033> I wish I knew man, damn jet engines are weak, all they do is look good to me
plane-crazy 2020-05-02 18:22:27 Lego PFP users are ugly and lonely
plane-crazy 2020-05-02 18:21:03 <@456226577798135808> yes, I'm very very very very obviously 6, what of it Einstein

plane-crazy 2020-05-02 17:54:43 Hm
plane-crazy 2020-05-02 17:54:43 
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 06:49:43 man I gotta say goodbye to this tank so I can finish this mega sized airship i'm working on
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 06:47:13 that's a pretty zeppelin my guy
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 06:46:05 aye not to flex but uh
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 06:44:09 Dang, that's pretty
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 06:43:55 Real question, ever seen many big builds that survive long in pvp lol
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 06:43:02 SAME
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 06:42:59 I got some pretty crazy things in my inventory when it comes to planes
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 06:42:15 im great with everything except cars despite me workin on em
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 06:41:58 don't worry, I know people who can't even make a plane but they excessively massive boats and land ships fine
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 06:40:27 it's not like I can't, I just don't like to
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 06:39:53 also my god that speed
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 06:39:48 whew, that's good. I'm not into making replicas and kinda like to do my own thing, just wanted to check tho
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 06:37:10 Jets based on real life aircraft
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 06:36:59 like uuhh hm
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 06:34:42 also, I barely noticed those ranks, huh. Do the builds have to be replicas? (and np)
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 06:34:17 Kudos is basically just saying "I respect what you've done" and giving praise while doing so
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 06:25:22 <@445069748372373506> too nice but thanks for the compliments man, kudos to your builds
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 06:20:21 Ahh, ty guys
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 06:19:48 Is it okay to post more stuff?
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 06:19:30 thank you whoever did so ðŸ˜„
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 06:19:23 <@445069748372373506> huh. Well
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 06:18:28 <@218240161719386112> Around 2.5k, but was worth the space
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 06:11:39 
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 06:11:38 got bored, made this, walks slow, but fine
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 06:09:00 Hm, I still like it either way. Nice design though ðŸ™‚
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 06:06:14 mhm Np ðŸ˜„
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 06:04:41 looks good so far, length should be fine
