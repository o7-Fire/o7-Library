creations-chat 2020-05-13 22:47:04 I'm gonna give you honest critisizm for your helicopter, instead of just downvoting and saying "ew bad heliclopter"
The nose is too small, and rotor is too big, legacy glass, seemingly no way in/out, rear propellers, when it's coaxial, strange nose shape, lack of glass most anywhere
creations-chat 2020-05-13 22:47:19 also, epic your helicopter looks really good
creations-chat 2020-05-13 22:47:38 the glass isnt too bad on yours
creations-chat 2020-05-13 22:47:57 oh, I was talking to des about the criticism
creations-chat 2020-05-13 22:48:04 but, your glass is pretty great
creations-chat 2020-05-13 22:48:44 to be honest it's already good enough, and even if it wasnt, the rest of the helicopter would easily make up for it.
creations-chat 2020-05-13 22:49:31 you have to post in in creations
