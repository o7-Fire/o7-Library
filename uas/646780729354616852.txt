help 2021-02-05 20:59:06 How to make suggestion
help 2021-02-05 21:46:23 My suggestion was pretty simple : a wielder tool, to connect blocks. Cuz if you build 2 pieces next to each other but you didn't build one starting on the side of the other, they will not be connected when you launch the plane/thing
help 2021-02-05 21:47:01 And not gona lie the game realy needs that
help 2021-02-05 21:53:08 Means that you can connect blocks
help 2021-02-05 21:53:21 Instead of the they just fall apart when you launch
help 2021-02-05 21:54:00 You never had that problem?
help 2021-02-05 21:54:38 Bruh
help 2021-02-05 21:54:51 Not that
help 2021-02-05 21:55:00 Leme give a example
help 2021-02-05 21:55:11 Imagine minecraft
help 2021-02-05 21:55:15 You have 4 spaces
help 2021-02-05 21:55:39 But instead of placing the blocks in a line, you place 2 on the left wall and other 2 on the right wall
help 2021-02-05 21:56:06 In plane crazy if you build like that the blocks will not be connected in a structure when you launch
help 2021-02-05 21:56:39 Exacly
help 2021-02-05 21:56:51 That's why they need add a tool to glue them
help 2021-02-05 21:57:11 But they touch
help 2021-02-05 21:57:35 I'll just make a vid...
help 2021-02-05 21:59:54 Nvm I can't do that
help 2021-02-05 22:00:34 Just Imagine a reverse disconector

bot-central 2021-02-06 11:37:14 Now ima wait to get home to get be to post my plane
bot-central 2021-02-06 11:37:39 I had to make a non helium version of it so it fits the requirements
bot-central 2021-02-06 11:38:04 It flies faster that way tho
bot-central 2021-02-06 11:38:23 But with helium is more stable
bot-central 2021-02-06 11:41:34 The yaw isn't perfect but there is literaly no plane that performs a 360 spin horizontally so
