The Tale of brambam. (689894917207883853)
creations-chat 2020-08-08 19:04:54 > <@!689894917207883853> i really like your 19th century frigate, but i just wanna give some advice so don't take this as a personal assault like a karen (idk why u would but there's always the type who does). So I'm not gonna say anything about the shape or stuff like that but what I'm talk about is colour, the black on the ship is too dark and the yellow is too light and also add a gradient to both colours. But you don't have to do this if you don't want to, as stated before I'm just giving advice or critique or whatever its called.
<@324274557965959172> yeah I was thinking sorta the same thing, it's actually navy blue, but I am considering making it lighter. Thanks for the constructive criticism anyway, I'm not a Karen dw lmao
creations-chat 2020-08-21 18:33:34 Nah they obviously weren't appreciated
creations-chat 2020-08-21 18:33:57 Lol usually I get like 40 - 50 upvotes feels weird having sudden downvotes
creations-chat 2020-08-21 18:34:25 The reason I upvoted is because if one single person downvotes noobs jump on the bandwagon and start doing it too
creations-chat 2020-08-21 18:34:30 I've seen it happen to others
creations-chat 2020-08-21 18:34:40 Didnt want it to happen to me
creations-chat 2020-08-21 18:36:47 I didnt freak out bruh
creations-chat 2020-08-21 18:36:52 I dont do that
creations-chat 2020-08-21 18:39:10 I deleted my messages because I didnt want to be involved in your childish argument anymore
creations-chat 2020-08-21 18:39:32 I have better things to do that argue with people who clearly just want to continue an argument rather than end one
creations-chat 2020-08-21 18:39:53 So dont @ me I've got better things to do
creations-chat 2020-08-21 20:36:20 > Bruh why dont you ask for a designer [IV] rank
<@456226577798135808> thanks bruh I didnt think to ask but I have it now
creations-chat 2020-08-21 20:39:32 Good luck with that
creations-chat 2020-08-21 23:17:10 Warthog go brrr
creations-chat 2020-08-21 23:17:39 Warthogogogogog
creations-chat 2020-08-21 23:18:30 Therapist: warthogogogogog doesnt exsist

Warthogogogogog:
creations-chat 2020-08-21 23:19:45 I have to say, rn I'd agree tho
creations-chat 2020-08-21 23:22:33 Ikr I also noticed that two pics could be the same thing, but if one gets a downvote, people jump on the bandwagon and all down vote. If it gets upvote then more people upvote
creations-chat 2020-08-21 23:23:09 Most people like to follow the pack I guess rather than lead
creations-chat 2020-08-21 23:23:27 Sorry XD
creations-chat 2020-08-21 23:23:40 I think just for the humour it deserves an upvote

creations-chat 2020-08-23 23:49:39 Just finished a 7000+ block freighter ship, took me a week. Would appreciate some feedback!

creations-chat 2020-08-23 23:58:16 <@419477639229865984> thanks!
creations-chat 2020-08-24 00:38:04 The big cheese
creations-chat 2020-08-24 00:40:14 New York should be called the big orange not the big apple
creations-chat 2020-08-24 02:02:48 <@456226577798135808> Ye it's a quick and efficient way of notifying them of your post when a rank requires a certain amount of upvotes, that way they literally just click my ping and they've got proof in seconds, saving them from searching for it
creations-chat 2020-08-24 02:03:05 Means I get my rank quicker, and they get to find it quicker
creations-chat 2020-08-24 02:03:12 Easier for both of us
creations-chat 2020-08-24 02:05:14 Nah I'd rather just type a word when posting, rather than post it, take a screen shot, head over to the dm, send that pic
creations-chat 2020-08-24 02:05:33 8 characters ain't that hard
creations-chat 2020-08-24 02:05:40 Not that time consuming to type
creations-chat 2020-08-24 02:06:53 Well as I've just explained it isnt
creations-chat 2020-08-24 02:07:11 Not unless you forgot to type it in the first place, in which case you're right
creations-chat 2020-08-24 02:08:23 Bro, if you take screenshots find a dm, then send that quicker than typing a word when you're already typing out words in your post meaning you domt have to go anywhere, good for you. Personally my way is quicker for me
creations-chat 2020-08-24 02:09:23 If your way is quicker for you good for you bro. I ain't got time to argue on a discord server about which way is quicker to notify staff of your build on a Lego game
creations-chat 2020-08-24 02:11:23 Imagine trying to start an argument with someone online who you don't even know about their methods of notifying staff <:KEKW:670310537300672528> <:OmegaTroll:626841385118597152>

creations-chat 2020-08-24 03:50:39 The 7300+ block freighter I completed tonight
creations-chat 2020-08-24 03:52:24 Lol thanks, I finally got the Shipwright Expert V as a result of this, thanks a lot it's nice hearing positive feedback after a week of doing this crap üòÇ
creations-chat 2020-08-24 04:01:07 Glad you guys like it
creations-chat 2020-08-24 12:32:59 Kinda random but ive been playing this game for over 2 years and has anyone else noticed there's a sort of barrier at 600 speed where it suddenly becomes more stable? I find below 600 your planes shape isnt too important but beyond 600 the drag drastically increases for me, meaning the shape of wings has to be realistic
creations-chat 2020-08-24 12:34:38 Honestly, if you're playing pvp stay in the 500s
creations-chat 2020-08-24 12:35:21 Yeah sure make it go as fast as you want but in pvp have like a mode for slow flight
creations-chat 2020-08-24 12:35:25 Makes it easier to aim
creations-chat 2020-08-24 12:35:51 My magnet jet got to near 6000 speed but then it lagged so much I didnt use it again
creations-chat 2020-08-24 12:36:29 Noice
creations-chat 2020-08-24 12:37:44 I my jet going 6000 speed with the entire elevators/rudder moving rather than control surfaces (realistic to modern jets) is laggy as hell
creations-chat 2020-08-24 12:38:28 Honestly I'd rather do a slow fly by with a jet at 400 - 500 for a bomb and run attack
creations-chat 2020-08-24 12:38:50 That's cool
creations-chat 2020-08-24 12:38:57 If it works then it works
creations-chat 2020-08-24 12:39:50 Try adding a camera on the bottom of your plane with a glass block and a text block with a + or √ó facing the camera for an aim
creations-chat 2020-08-24 12:40:28 Can be adjusted via motor 2 to be at an angle to aim ahead of your bomb to counter for how far the bomb will fly forwards due to your planes speed
creations-chat 2020-08-24 12:40:54 Sounds complex but just play around with the concept it might be easier than you think
creations-chat 2020-08-24 12:41:08 Righto
creations-chat 2020-08-24 12:41:36 I'm planning on creating some kind of VTOL carrier to get me the VTOL 5 rank
creations-chat 2020-08-24 12:42:53 Damn, I turned my basic carrier hull into a cargo freighter
creations-chat 2020-08-24 12:43:01 Lmao
creations-chat 2020-08-24 12:44:38 Imagine a VTOL carrier with onboard fighter aircraft, and turrets
creations-chat 2020-08-24 12:44:45 Might make that
creations-chat 2020-08-24 12:58:53 You had one job bomb
creations-chat 2020-08-24 22:26:27 <@695783576549195936> lowering the torque the really really low helps with the spazzing
creations-chat 2020-08-25 00:28:29 Been working on a Thrust Bloodhound SSC today, this is the end result

creations-chat 2020-08-25 00:30:09 I even got every single sponsor
creations-chat 2020-08-25 00:30:14 ._.
creations-chat 2020-08-25 00:30:20 Thanks bruh
creations-chat 2020-08-25 00:31:07 The past hour I've been doing every sponsor in it as accurate as possible lmao
creations-chat 2020-08-25 00:31:40 True that
creations-chat 2020-08-25 00:31:46 Imma post it
creations-chat 2020-08-25 00:37:10 Thanks for the feedback! Although, every sponsor is to scale and where it is on the version that broke the record in south Africa
creations-chat 2020-08-25 00:41:03 Yeah I might look into that, thanks for the feedback, although it is based on the real thing. It's a chunky square boi towards the back
creations-chat 2020-08-25 00:41:28 Thanks üòÅ

creations-chat 2020-08-25 15:16:40 <@590503508667662346> looks really great in every way, however I'd say the rudder needs to be at more of an angle
creations-chat 2020-08-25 15:16:46 At the front*
creations-chat 2020-08-25 15:17:15 Because it should slope more at the front than it does at that back. Saying that, everything else is awesome!
creations-chat 2020-08-25 18:20:00 What is this place coming to
creations-chat 2020-08-25 18:21:20 Its 2020 anything could happen cant blame him for trying

creations-chat 2020-08-26 21:18:00 Could put disconnecters above the lights to cover them
creations-chat 2020-08-26 21:18:10 So they only show through the glass
creations-chat 2020-08-26 21:18:42 
creations-chat 2020-08-26 21:18:48 I did that with my robloxian scale 4x4
creations-chat 2020-08-26 21:19:16 Wha
creations-chat 2020-08-26 21:20:07 A 4x4 would have a 4x4 system actually, that's the only requirement but sure I'd add a more advanced one if it wasnt robloxian scale
creations-chat 2020-08-26 21:20:51 That's cool
creations-chat 2020-08-26 21:21:23 Considering this car has been to every single place in the world that's land, I think it's fine lmaow

creations-chat 2020-08-27 05:28:54 Compared to robloxian
creations-chat 2020-08-27 05:29:38 Big builds are cool too
creations-chat 2020-08-27 05:29:59 I just dont like hating on small builds for a lack of detail

creations-chat 2020-08-27 05:41:07 Yeah lmao
creations-chat 2020-08-27 05:41:30 Like I have a hinge on my freighter that has a removal button after its configured
creations-chat 2020-08-27 05:41:39 I made it stay attached lol
creations-chat 2020-08-27 05:42:17 Like motor 2?
creations-chat 2020-08-27 05:44:43 I literally have only done robloxian scale for the entire time I've been playing
creations-chat 2020-08-27 05:45:05 Even though it limits you I find that better because it gives you a challenge
creations-chat 2020-08-27 05:45:44 That's cool
creations-chat 2020-08-27 05:47:05 But the thing I like about robloxian scale is I'm not drawing the line on what size it can be randomly, there's a point to it, it's realistic to an avatar. I then have a reason to do it at that scale
creations-chat 2020-08-27 05:47:17 Although building any other scale is totally cool too
creations-chat 2020-08-27 05:47:50 Before the   s h r e d d e r s
creations-chat 2020-08-27 05:48:02 Lmaow
creations-chat 2020-08-27 05:48:16 But heres something to do on pvp:
creations-chat 2020-08-27 05:49:23 Set up a disaster situation for yourself, like me on my cargo freighter with no weapons. Then think of a way to escape, like me in a lifeboat. Then try your best to put it into practice
creations-chat 2020-08-27 05:50:04 Yeah today I did two disasters
creations-chat 2020-08-27 05:50:27 The other being an unarmed passenger turboprop with explosives under the engines
creations-chat 2020-08-27 05:50:56 Problem with the freighter is no one can sink it
creations-chat 2020-08-27 05:51:13 Its never once been sunk in its whole existence
creations-chat 2020-08-27 05:51:53 Not an amazing design or anything, it's just when you get over a certain amount of blocks people get bored lmao and go away because it takes ages
creations-chat 2020-08-27 05:52:35 Cool
creations-chat 2020-08-27 05:52:38 How many blocks?
creations-chat 2020-08-27 05:53:55 I remember like nearly 3 years ago being new to this game and me and my brother were competitive. He built a jet with 450 top speed and he was so proud of it, then I build mine which got to 560 lol
creations-chat 2020-08-27 05:54:07 Yeah true! No its not your pc
creations-chat 2020-08-27 05:54:15 Every device I use does it at that speed
creations-chat 2020-08-27 05:54:27 Unless its stable enough
creations-chat 2020-08-27 05:55:03 Now my fastest jet, robloxian scale as always, goes over 5000 spees

creations-chat 2020-08-27 05:57:30 I'm not a tank person so
creations-chat 2020-08-27 05:58:45 I'm more of an aircraft guy myself
creations-chat 2020-08-27 05:58:53 Aeroplanes in specific
creations-chat 2020-08-27 05:59:19 Is it true they're called airplanes in murica
creations-chat 2020-08-27 05:59:39 Here in britian they're aeroplanes
creations-chat 2020-08-27 05:59:48 But yunno they're just referred to as planes
creations-chat 2020-08-27 06:00:03 Laughs in war of 1812
creations-chat 2020-08-27 06:00:33 Lmaow
creations-chat 2020-08-27 06:01:02 I love that detail for such a small build

bot-central 2020-09-24 21:24:15 -mapsuggest roads similar to the ones by the base and train station, but they lead all around the world to every location and are all connected. Also possibly forests? Maybe more than one island in a large ocean?

bug-reports 2020-12-18 23:59:31 
bug-reports 2020-12-19 00:00:52 There isnt an "open" button for this door in the base, since it's the winter update, this should be able to open and can on PC but not mobile. I think last winter mobile "open" buttons werent a thing, so this could be why.
