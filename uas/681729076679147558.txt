creations-chat 2020-02-25 05:27:37 Reliable open bolt operation. there is no locking mechanism for the bolt because roblox physics is sorta wack.
creations-chat 2020-02-25 05:50:25 alright il upload it to youtube because .wmv is sketchy
creations-chat 2020-02-25 06:00:23 its hard though, every design feature has its purpose
creations-chat 2020-02-25 06:03:26 im fairly sure its impossible in plane crazy since explosives provide little push
creations-chat 2020-02-25 06:04:13 also you would need to keybind the explosive since there is no sensory or automation functions in plane crazy which would add keybinds
creations-chat 2020-02-25 06:04:32 the only keybind currently is to push the bolt forward
creations-chat 2020-02-25 06:05:40 how do you link vt vids?
creations-chat 2020-02-25 06:08:27 Reupload ( last one was a .mvw or whatever which are sketchy.)
creations-chat 2020-02-25 06:19:57 there is a little bit more too it
creations-chat 2020-02-25 06:20:45 a round is pushed out of the mag and pushed up into the chamber
creations-chat 2020-02-25 06:21:20 yeah
creations-chat 2020-02-25 06:21:37 i tried to make it simple because roblox will crash
creations-chat 2020-02-25 06:22:22 though the hardest part was making the geometry right and having the extractor work
creations-chat 2020-02-25 06:23:48 thx doesnt shoot though ðŸ˜¦

bug-reports 2020-02-25 07:53:10 <@!217336009455566848> ik this isnt a bug but can you make impact tnt that explodes upon impact with an enemy. normal impact tnt is kinda useless ngl
creations-chat 2020-02-25 07:54:15 i made a chainsaw but it didnt work well because of cutting speed and lag so it would be lit having a good one
creations-chat 2020-02-25 07:57:45 ugh i wish i could post in the suggestions
bug-reports 2020-02-25 08:17:42 impact with an enemy because i have a minigun which doesnt work cause it impacts the barrel

creations-chat 2020-02-25 09:14:28 i joined today anyway
bot-central 2020-02-25 09:16:25 &suggest The ability to set tnt blocks to explode when impacting an enemy and not your creation or the ground. Its probably pretty simple and would benefit people trying to make tnt guns.

help 2020-02-25 11:41:44 can you put a swast ticka backwards because it means peace but allows a somewhat realistic look?

creations-chat 2020-02-28 15:14:30 its invisible
creations-chat 2020-02-28 15:14:46 i can only notice it when the block is reflecting light
creations-chat 2020-02-28 15:15:18 no ice used to have a texture that was different from normal block
bug-reports 2020-02-28 15:17:02 i am not getting a texture for ice material. Its only visible for me when reflecting light.
bug-reports 2020-02-28 15:17:44 well it sucks and it should be changed
bug-reports 2020-02-28 15:18:05 because i build with ice alot and its hard to tell if its ice or normal

help 2020-02-29 14:03:48 <@!163143541160148992> "it makes sense" ok. grab two metal plates, place them corner to corner so no face is touching, now weld them where they share faces (hint: there are none). now tell me, are those plates connected or not, because things can only be butted together in plane crazy, but this is an exception.

<@!344938630294274048> The wing is still attached on their screen. Its super dumb because theres a lag inbetween what you see and what they see and if you hit them and they are going over a certain speed then nothing will happen
