help 2020-07-16 06:03:23 if you want tank controls
help 2020-07-16 06:06:57 left track: Q= Forward A=backwards
Right track: D=forward E=backwards (that's control wise)
when you want to go forward, press q and e at the same time. when you want to go back, a and d at the same time. a regular left turn, you press e, and let go of q. a tight left turn, you hold e, and press a instead of q. vice versa for right turns
