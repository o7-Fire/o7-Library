creations-chat 2020-11-18 20:35:05 obc bible yes
creations-chat 2020-11-18 20:41:06 i question the excessive amount of barrels in the front and the main turret

creations-chat 2020-11-18 20:43:03 twice

interesting
creations-chat 2020-11-18 20:51:51 yeah I don't even use those wheels
creations-chat 2020-11-18 20:53:22 thanks fatbug :>
creations-chat 2020-11-18 21:00:01 it isn't exactly a wip
creations-chat 2020-11-18 21:01:41 that wasn't exactly my intent but okay
creations-chat 2020-11-18 21:03:24 no one has it

they either deleted it or it broke
creations-chat 2020-11-18 21:06:37 then it just broke
creations-chat 2020-11-18 21:16:26 thats epic

just finish the arms and stuff though

wait there's a head?
creations-chat 2020-11-18 21:19:44 for a weird looking plane, i would say you did well
creations-chat 2020-11-18 21:33:46 it isn't?

screw this slowmode >_>
creations-chat 2020-11-18 21:35:18 
creations-chat 2020-11-18 21:52:45 no pistons, the mondo spider is already fine

also the rope is stable because of thrust from the front plane
creations-chat 2020-11-18 21:56:21 lol you're suffering from slowmode
creations-chat 2020-11-19 01:29:51 Did I get ghostpinged here?
help 2020-11-20 22:01:12 what do you guys do every time you load in a camera locked creation
help 2020-11-20 22:01:24 to counteract the resetting of the cameras
help 2020-11-20 22:01:27 like
help 2020-11-20 22:01:46 so i'll have to reset it myself manually?
help 2020-11-20 22:02:29 welp
creations-chat 2020-11-20 22:03:59 looks like it needs to be a block wider
help 2020-11-24 14:17:09 https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/478584971670454284/780772392292319244 that would be horribly painful to make lmao
help 2020-11-24 14:19:31 but that's with cameras
creations-chat 2020-12-08 20:33:28 very epic power rangers wheelchair
creations-chat 2020-12-10 13:56:25 Lol it is exactly the same, but you screwed up on the motorlocking for the propeller

The control surfaces look different actually
creations-chat 2020-12-10 14:00:31 its fine to make tutorials as long as you learn from it
creations-chat 2020-12-14 12:59:54 <@!570182286029357058> you didnt provide an image

wait what
creations-chat 2020-12-14 22:56:58 <@!564663966509563914> the gondolas look strange, thicken axis iron cross symbol, give the thing a shape similar to an ellipsoid, fix front, put the guns to the sides

isn't that hard to make zeppelin fronts, i've made them before
creations-chat 2020-12-14 23:01:10 <@!665408211582582795> make barrel longer and don't make it so thick using sparklers i guess

also add a bit more detail like engine ventilation
shorten the **FRONT MACHINE** gun
and use text instead of half wedges

you have perfectly enough space for 100 size text
creations-chat 2020-12-14 23:03:57 
creations-chat 2020-12-14 23:07:31 
creations-chat 2020-12-14 23:11:03 As a replacement for the numbers on the side on NinjaBlue's Tiger 1 131

Or rather to show him what text looks like instead of half wedges
creations-chat 2020-12-15 13:05:54 too blocky
unrealistic when it comes to the size of the rocket and the satellite
solar panel placement is strange
is it using helium?
creations-chat 2020-12-15 13:09:32 try to figure out how to not rely on helium
creations-chat 2020-12-15 13:16:46 exactly
creations-chat 2020-12-15 13:25:17 ksp shuttle on minimum graphics?
creations-chat 2020-12-15 13:43:27 <@456226577798135808> i didn't think of motorlocking wing panels to keep the gait straight

genius
creations-chat 2020-12-27 13:29:02 <@!779680978423119873> why did you post a tutorial

creations-chat 2020-12-27 13:31:04 yeah how did you get ranks
