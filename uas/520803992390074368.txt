plane-crazy 2020-03-08 04:01:14 So is people getting banned from the game for no reason a ROBLOX thing or a game thing
plane-crazy 2020-03-01 23:00:17 Now someone can make a proper DeLorean
plane-crazy 2020-03-01 00:19:01 ekranoplan
plane-crazy 2020-02-12 20:25:12 <@!530539224781553694> I meant wedgeblock, I’m on mobile and it autocorrected, sorry
plane-crazy 2020-02-12 20:07:20 Just use triangle wedges and wedge locks
plane-crazy 2020-02-09 19:06:27 Ok, thank you rick, very cool
plane-crazy 2020-02-09 19:05:13 So is not being able to see the direction of the blocks in first person a game bug or a Roblox thing?
plane-crazy 2020-02-08 05:07:46 Oh a Falcon
plane-crazy 2020-02-08 04:30:51 Coaxial I see
plane-crazy 2020-02-05 02:06:45 nice
plane-crazy 2020-02-05 01:08:22 Although red should be a bit darker
plane-crazy 2020-02-05 01:08:06 That’s how it’s supposed to be
plane-crazy 2020-02-04 02:08:50 It's a VTOL/Ship
plane-crazy 2020-02-04 02:07:37 are you in a vip server
plane-crazy 2020-02-04 02:06:45 yes
plane-crazy 2020-02-04 02:01:39 oh no
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 10:33:03 Tank
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 03:56:52 I mean turbo’s build was a joint project between turbo and Admiral
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 03:49:33 I know how they work but sizing
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 03:49:04 How does one make that
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 03:48:19 What are the balances for helicopters supposed to be
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 03:46:10 We are still in voting
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 03:45:43 Probably in a week or two
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 03:45:06 Make sure the elevators are about half the length of the main wings
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 03:44:28 Put blocks and wings and control surfaces then a super rocket engine on the back
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 03:39:49 And by cooperative I mean 9 alts filling a server
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 03:39:05 It would need to be a cooperative build
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 03:32:17 My flying carrier with warp
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 03:12:17 tan^-1 (1/4)
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 03:10:39 Welcome back creativ
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 03:09:24 If the forklift keeps tilting you should probably separate the wheels further apart and put the weight towards the ground
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 03:08:07 The forklift reminds me kind of this
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 03:07:45 https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=t0fML0kM7cM
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 03:05:36 Constructive criticism: The “forklift” looks more like a sorting package robot
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 03:03:41 Looks more like a claw than forks tbh
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 03:02:32 Hmmmmmmm
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 03:01:24 It looks like it’s trying to be counterweights
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 03:00:46 I don’t talk about my first “fold” because it sucked
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 03:00:02 It’s my “second” fold build
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 02:59:14 Also the island is wrong because the folds
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 02:58:53 It can fly
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 02:58:18 
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 02:57:53 I have a bad Nimitz class carrier
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 02:57:10 And I have the modern hornet that is now a museum in Alameda
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 02:56:20 I mean you can bomb a plane
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 02:56:01 Ship or jet?
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 01:59:38 Oh no
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 01:58:09 Don’t worry he likes it for some weird reason
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 01:57:52 And yes it is my pet penguin
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 01:52:18 Casual executor class star destroyer
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 01:49:08 Yes
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 01:47:53 Why not
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 01:47:34 Make a hybrid CIWS and Sea Ram
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 01:45:35 Nvm thinking of another thing
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 01:43:23 Wouldnt it be CIWS
plane-crazy 2020-01-19 07:27:40 I’m getting Ekranoplan vibes from that picture
plane-crazy 2020-01-18 03:15:48 The raised fuselage to accommodate for the 2nd level
plane-crazy 2020-01-18 00:06:58 Ok nvm my computer pulled a no no and I had to restart it
plane-crazy 2020-01-18 00:04:42 Only thing I’ve done is the known motor lock glitch
plane-crazy 2020-01-18 00:03:29 Is anyone else getting immediately kicked when joining the game?
plane-crazy 2020-01-17 18:07:56 F
plane-crazy 2020-01-17 17:21:19 Needs mouse keys
plane-crazy 2020-01-17 17:21:10 That’s a lot
plane-crazy 2020-01-12 20:57:43 build battles
plane-crazy 2020-01-12 20:57:31 thatd be fun
plane-crazy 2020-01-12 20:57:21 lol
plane-crazy 2020-01-12 20:56:42 make ahybrid
plane-crazy 2020-01-09 03:58:07 ah yes the west
plane-crazy 2020-01-09 03:46:16 only carrier rank i know of is Floating Fortress
plane-crazy 2020-01-08 02:40:39 and you have to use a beam
plane-crazy 2020-01-08 02:40:17 i found a way to build outside of your plot but it only goes the length of the beam
plane-crazy 2020-01-08 02:15:55 Farewell poor unde
plane-crazy 2020-01-08 02:12:04 uhhhhh
plane-crazy 2020-01-08 02:11:18 
plane-crazy 2020-01-08 02:10:01 Why is there a Zumwalt
plane-crazy 2020-01-08 02:07:45 For those of you that said the FedEx jet looked cool, here is a better picture
plane-crazy 2020-01-08 02:05:29 I mean they probably replace the props too and add better ones
plane-crazy 2020-01-08 01:58:14 Pretty sure US military is trying to add lazers to them
plane-crazy 2020-01-08 01:57:09 
plane-crazy 2020-01-08 01:57:06 anyways another picture of the F-14
plane-crazy 2020-01-08 01:56:41 they work and it gets the job done
plane-crazy 2020-01-08 01:53:45 The AC-130 is just an attack variant of the C-130 "Hercules"
plane-crazy 2020-01-08 01:52:33 Big gun
plane-crazy 2020-01-08 01:50:14 I think we still use the AC-130
plane-crazy 2020-01-08 01:48:50 
plane-crazy 2020-01-08 01:48:11 wanna see a picture of and F-14
plane-crazy 2020-01-01 20:16:55 My excuse of a carrier
plane-crazy 2019-12-20 21:54:56 Ok
plane-crazy 2019-12-20 21:53:28 If you have an Xbox one you can hook it up to your computer and use that as a tv
plane-crazy 2019-12-20 21:51:48 Soooo..... I may have or may have not gone supersonic in an aircraft carrier
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 03:34:16 its a sign
