creations-chat 2021-07-10 16:50:31 <@!840016197135237161> I suggest using some wedges
creations-chat 2021-07-10 22:09:13 What’re you making? Cause I suggest getting an eye dropper extension
help 2021-07-10 22:12:37 There’s a point at which the amount of thrust is equal to the amount of weight that gravity is pushing on you, you just need to find the perfect point at which that happens, alternatively you can have an engine creating downwards thrust and make it so that the amount of downward thrust is equal to upwards thrust.

help 2021-07-26 21:03:32 Motorlock basically shrinks the motor to a half block and with it goes any other block connected. When you stack them in a tower you are able to fuse them into one block height, which many use to have lots of engines sand hide them.
