Has Among Us negatively affected how we view things in the world.
Will a red rectangular fire detector siren with curved angles with a clear glass cover over the siren lights ever look the same again.
Please tell me this isn't true.

Please tell me there is a way to not see red Among Us crew mate.
What even was life before Among Us.
It is like a new phase of the world has started with the awakening of Among Us.
Things in our environment will slowly change into things that appear like they're from Among Us.
All for the end goal of Amogus IRL.
