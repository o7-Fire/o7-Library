help 2023-02-11 16:16:07 build some tuturial builds (build tuturial is fine) then go make your own when people make fun of you tuturial builds
help 2023-02-11 19:02:38 i think the best way for someone to improve off of guide vid is to first make something by your self(if you cant amkea tut and learn from that) then when they want to improve they look at the guide vids and pick up the details
help 2023-02-11 19:04:27 well i started making mechs recently and so far ive done 1 tuturial for a frame and ive been building around it and getting to know what does what better and what makes it stand up right etc, and when i do make my own frame and if i run into issues the next thing id do would be guides
help 2023-02-11 19:06:02 nice i never looked at jet tut and the only thing i picked up from guides were use moter 2 servo for turning (which i alrady knew i think)
