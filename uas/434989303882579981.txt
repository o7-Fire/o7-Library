the-dump 2019-04-27 03:01:36 According to all known laws
of aviation,

  
there is no way a bee
should be able to fly.

  
Its wings are too small to get
its fat little body off the ground.

  
The bee, of course, flies anyway

  
because bees don't care
what humans think is impossible.

  
Yellow, black. Yellow, black.
Yellow, black. Yellow, black.

  
Ooh, black and yellow!
Let's shake it up a little.

  
Barry! Breakfast is ready!

  
Ooming!

  
Hang on a second.

  
Hello?

  
- Barry?
- Adam?

  
- Oan you believe this is happening?
- I can't. I'll pick you up.

  
Looking sharp.

  
Use the stairs. Your father
paid good money for those.

  
Sorry. I'm excited.

  
Here's the graduate.
We're very proud of you, son.

  
A perfect report card, all B's.

  
Very proud.

  
Ma! I got a thing going here.

  
- You got lint on your fuzz.
- Ow! That's me!

  
- Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000.
- Bye!
the-dump 2019-04-27 03:02:13 - Ow! That's me!

Barry, I told you,
stop flying in the house!

  
- Hey, Adam.
- Hey, Barry.

  
- Is that fuzz gel?
- A little. Special day, graduation.

  
Never thought I'd make it.

  
Three days grade school,
three days high school.

  
Those were awkward.

  
Three days college. I'm glad I took
a day and hitchhiked around the hive.

  
You did come back different.

  
- Hi, Barry.
- Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good.

  
- Hear about Frankie?
- Yeah.

  
- You going to the funeral?
- No, I'm not going.

  
Everybody knows,
sting someone, you die.

  
Don't waste it on a squirrel.
Such a hothead.

  
I guess he could have
just gotten out of the way.

  
I love this incorporating
an amusement park into our day.

  
That's why we don't need vacations.

  
Boy, quite a bit of pomp...
under the circumstances.

  
- Well, Adam, today we are men.
- We are!

  
- Bee-men.
- Amen!

  
Hallelujah!

  
Students, faculty, distinguished bees,

  
please welcome Dean Buzzwell.

  
Welcome, New Hive Oity
graduating class of...

  
...9:15.

  
That concludes our ceremonies.

  
And begins your career
at Honex Industries!

  
Will we pick ourjob today?

  
I heard it's just orientation.

  
Heads up! Here we go.

  
Keep your hands and antennas
inside the tram at all times.

  
- Wonder what it'll be like?
- A little scary.

  
Welcome to Honex,
a division of Honesco

  
and a part of the Hexagon Group.

  
This is it!

  
Wow.

  
Wow.

  
We know that you, as a bee,
have worked your whole life

  
to get to the point where you
can work for your whole life.

TOUR GUIDE:

We know that you, as a bee,

have worked your whole life

to get to the point where you

can work for your whole life.

Honey begins when our valiant Pollen

Jocks bring the nectar to the hive.

Our top-secret formula

is automatically color-corrected,

scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured

into this soothing sweet syrup

with its distinctive

golden glow you know as...

EVERYONE ON BUS:

Honey!

(The guide has been collecting honey into a bottle and she throws it into the crowd on the bus and it is caught by a girl in the back)

ADAM:

- That girl was hot.

BARRY:

- She's my cousin!

ADAM==

- She is?

BARRY:

- Yes, we're all cousins.

ADAM:

- Right. You're right.

TOUR GUIDE:

- At Honex, we constantly strive

to improve every aspect

of bee existence.

These bees are stress-testing

a new helmet technology.

(The bus passes by a Bee wearing a helmet who is being smashed into the ground with fly-swatters, newspapers and boots. He lifts a thumbs up but you can hear him groan)

BARRY:

- Not enough.

TOUR GUIDE:

Here we have our latest advancement,

the Krelman.

(They pass by a turning wheel with Bees standing on pegs, who are each wearing a finger-shaped hat)

Barry:

- Wow, What does that do?

TOUR GUIDE:

- Catches that little strand of honey

that hangs after you pour it.

Saves us millions.

ADAM:

(Intrigued)

Can anyone work on the Krelman?

TOUR GUIDE:

Of course. Most bee jobs are

small ones.

But bees know that every small job,

if it's done well, means a lot.

But choose carefully

because you'll stay in the job

you pick for the rest of your life.

(Everyone claps except for Barry)

BARRY:

The same job the rest of your life?

I didn't know that.
the-dump 2019-04-27 03:07:05 What's the difference?

TOUR GUIDE:

You'll be happy to know that bees,

as a species, haven't had one day off

in 27 million years.

BARRY:

(Upset)

So you'll just work us to death?

We'll sure try.

(Everyone on the bus laughs except Barry. Barry and Adam are walking back home together)

ADAM:

Wow! That blew my mind!

BARRY:

"What's the difference?"

How can you say that?

One job forever?

That's an insane choice to have to make.

- Wow.

I've never seen them this close.

BARRY:

They know what it's like

outside the hive.

ADAM:

Yeah, but some don't come back.

GIRL BEES:

- Hey, Jocks!

- Hi, Jocks!

(The Pollen Jocks hook up their backpacks to machines that pump the nectar to trucks, which drive away)

LOU LO DUVA:

You guys did great!

You're monsters!

You're sky freaks!

I love it!

(Punching the Pollen Jocks in joy)

I love it!

ADAM:

- I wonder where they were.

BARRY:

- I don't know.

Their day's not planned.
the-dump 2019-04-27 03:07:45 Outside the hive, flying who knows

where, doing who knows what.

You can't just decide to be a Pollen

Jock. You have to be bred for that.

ADAM==

Right.

(Barry and Adam are covered in some pollen that floated off of the Pollen Jocks)

BARRY:

Look at that. That's more pollen

than you and I will see in a lifetime.

ADAM:

It's just a status symbol.

Bees make too much of it.

BARRY:

Perhaps. Unless you're wearing it

and the ladies see you wearing it.

(Barry waves at 2 girls standing a little away from them)

ADAM==

Those ladies?

Aren't they our cousins too?

BARRY:

Distant. Distant.

POLLEN JOCK #1:

Look at these two.

POLLEN JOCK #2:

- Couple of Hive Harrys.

POLLEN JOCK #1:

- Let's have fun with them.

GIRL BEE #1:

It must be dangerous

being a Pollen Jock.

BARRY:

Yeah. Once a bear pinned me

against a mushroom!

He had a paw on my throat,

and with the other, he was slapping me!

(Slaps Adam with his hand to represent his scenario)

GIRL BEE #2:

- Oh, my!

BARRY:

- I never thought I'd knock him out.

GIRL BEE #1:

(Looking at Adam)

What were you doing during this?

ADAM:

Obviously I was trying to alert the authorities.

BARRY:

I can autograph that.

(The pollen jocks walk up to Barry and Adam, they pretend that Barry and Adam really are pollen jocks.)

POLLEN JOCK #1:

A little gusty out there today,

wasn't it, comrades?

BARRY:

Yeah. Gusty.

POLLEN JOCK #1:

We're hitting a sunflower patch

six miles from here tomorrow.

BARRY:

- Six miles, huh?

ADAM:

- Barry!

POLLEN JOCK #2:

A puddle jump for us,

but maybe you're not up for it.

BARRY:

- Maybe I am.

ADAM:

- You are not!

POLLEN JOCK #1:

We're going 0900 at J-Gate.

What do you think, buzzy-boy?

Are you bee enough?

BARRY:

I might be. It all depends

on what 0900 means.

(The scene cuts to Barry looking out on the hive-city
the-dump 2019-04-27 03:08:04 MARTIN:

Hey, Honex!

BARRY:

Dad, you surprised me.

MARTIN:

You decide what you're interested in?

BARRY:

- Well, there's a lot of choices.

- But you only get one.

Do you ever get bored

doing the same job every day?

MARTIN:

Son, let me tell you about stirring.

You grab that stick, and you just

move it around, and you stir it around.

You get yourself into a rhythm.

It's a beautiful thing.

BARRY:

You know, Dad,

the more I think about it,

maybe the honey field

just isn't right for me.

MARTIN:

You were thinking of what,

making balloon animals?

That's a bad job

for a guy with a stinger.

Janet, your son's not sure

he wants to go into honey!

JANET:

- Barry, you are so funny sometimes.

BARRY:

- I'm not trying to be funny.

MARTIN:

You're not funny! You're going

into honey. Our son, the stirrer!

JANET:

- You're gonna be a stirrer?

BARRY:

- No one's listening to me!

MARTIN:

Wait till you see the sticks I have.

BARRY:

I could say anything right now.

I'm gonna get an ant tattoo!

(Barry's parents don't listen to him and continue to ramble on)

MARTIN:

Let's open some honey and celebrate!

BARRY:

Maybe I'll pierce my thorax.

Shave my antennae.

Shack up with a grasshopper. Get

a gold tooth and call everybody "dawg"!

JANET:

I'm so proud.

(The scene cuts to Barry and Adam waiting in line to get a job)

ADAM:

- We're starting work today!

BARRY:

- Today's the day.

ADAM:

Come on! All the good jobs

will be gone.

BARRY:

Yeah, right.

JOB LISTER:

Pollen counting, stunt bee, pouring,

stirrer, front desk, hair removal...

BEE IN FRONT OF LINE:

- Is it still available?

JOB LISTER:

- Hang on. Two left!

One of them's yours! Congratulations!

Step to the side.

ADAM:

- What'd you get?

BEE IN FRONT OF LINE:

- Picking crud out. Stellar!
the-dump 2019-04-27 03:08:22 (He walks away)

ADAM:

Wow!

JOB LISTER:

Couple of newbies?

ADAM:

Yes, sir! Our first day! We are ready!

JOB LISTER:

Make your choice.

(Adam and Barry look up at the job board. There are hundreds of constantly changing panels that contain available or unavailable jobs. It looks very confusing)

ADAM:

- You want to go first?

BARRY:

- No, you go.

ADAM:

Oh, my. What's available?

JOB LISTER:

Restroom attendant's open,

not for the reason you think.

ADAM:

- Any chance of getting the Krelman?

JOB LISTER:

- Sure, you're on.

(Puts the Krelman finger-hat on Adam's head)

(Suddenly the sign for Krelman closes out)

I'm sorry, the Krelman just closed out.

(Takes Adam's hat off)

Wax monkey's always open.

ADAM:

The Krelman opened up again.

What happened?

JOB LISTER:

A bee died. Makes an opening. See?

He's dead. Another dead one.

Deady. Deadified. Two more dead.

Dead from the neck up.

Dead from the neck down. That's life!

ADAM:

Oh, this is so hard!

(Barry remembers what the Pollen Jock offered him and he flies off)

Heating, cooling,

stunt bee, pourer, stirrer,

humming, inspector number seven,

lint coordinator, stripe supervisor,

mite wrangler. Barry, what

do you think I should... Barry?

(Adam turns around and sees Barry flying away)

Barry!

POLLEN JOCK:

All right, we've got the sunflower patch

in quadrant nine...

ADAM:

(Through phone)

What happened to you?

Where are you?

BARRY:

- I'm going out.

ADAM:

- Out? Out where?

BARRY:

- Out there.

ADAM:

- Oh, no!

BARRY:

I have to, before I go

to work for the rest of my life.

ADAM:

You're gonna die! You're crazy!

(Barry hangs up)

Hello?

POLLEN JOCK #2:

Another call coming in.

If anyone's feeling brave,

there's a Korean deli on 83rd

that gets their roses today.
the-dump 2019-04-27 03:08:35 Hey, guys.

POLLEN JOCK #1 ==

- Look at that.

POLLEN JOCK #2:

- Isn't that the kid we saw yesterday?

LOU LO DUVA:

Hold it, son, flight deck's restricted.

POLLEN JOCK #1:

It's OK, Lou. We're gonna take him up.

(Puts hand on Barry's shoulder)

LOU LO DUVA:

(To Barry) Really? Feeling lucky, are you?

BEE WITH CLIPBOARD:

(To Barry) Sign here, here. Just initial that.

- Thank you.

LOU LO DUVA:

- OK.

You got a rain advisory today,

and as you all know,

bees cannot fly in rain.

So be careful. As always,

watch your brooms,

hockey sticks, dogs,

birds, bears and bats.

Also, I got a couple of reports

of root beer being poured on us.

Murphy's in a home because of it,

babbling like a cicada!

BARRY:

- That's awful.

LOU LO DUVA:

(Still talking through megaphone)

- And a reminder for you rookies,

bee law number one,

absolutely no talking to humans!

All right, launch positions!

POLLEN JOCKS:

(The Pollen Jocks run into formation)

Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz,

buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz!

LOU LU DUVA:

Black and yellow!

POLLEN JOCKS:

Hello!

POLLEN JOCK #1:

(To Barry)You ready for this, hot shot?

BARRY:

Yeah. Yeah, bring it on.

POLLEN JOCK's:

Wind, check.

- Antennae, check.

- Nectar pack, check.

- Wings, check.

- Stinger, check.

BARRY:

Scared out of my shorts, check.

LOU LO DUVA:

OK, ladies,

let's move it out!

Pound those petunias,

you striped stem-suckers!

All of you, drain those flowers!

(The pollen jocks fly out of the hive)

BARRY:

Wow! I'm out!

I can't believe I'm out!

So blue.

I feel so fast and free!

Box kite!

(Barry flies through the kite)

Wow!

Flowers!

(A pollen jock puts on some high tech goggles that shows flowers similar to heat sink goggles.)
the-dump 2019-04-27 03:08:51 POLLEN JOCK:

This is Blue Leader.

We have roses visual.

Bring it around 30 degrees and hold.

Roses!

POLLEN JOCK #1:

30 degrees, roger. Bringing it around.

Stand to the side, kid.

It's got a bit of a kick.

(The pollen jock fires a high-tech gun at the flower, shooting tubes that suck up the nectar from the flower and collects it into a pouch on the gun)

BARRY:

That is one nectar collector!

POLLEN JOCK #1==

- Ever see pollination up close?

BARRY:

- No, sir.

POLLEN JOCK #1:

(Barry and the Pollen jock fly over the field, the pollen jock sprinkles pollen as he goes)

I pick up some pollen here, sprinkle it

over here. Maybe a dash over there,

a pinch on that one.

See that? It's a little bit of magic.

BARRY:

That's amazing. Why do we do that?

POLLEN JOCK #1:

That's pollen power. More pollen, more

flowers, more nectar, more honey for us.

BARRY:

Cool.

POLLEN JOCK #1:

I'm picking up a lot of bright yellow.

could be daisies. Don't we need those?

POLLEN JOCK #2:

Copy that visual.

Wait. One of these flowers

seems to be on the move.

POLLEN JOCK #1:

Say again? You're reporting

a moving flower?

POLLEN JOCK #2:

Affirmative.

(The Pollen jocks land near the "flowers" which, to the audience are obviously just tennis balls)

KEN:

(In the distance) That was on the line!

POLLEN JOCK #1:

This is the coolest. What is it?

POLLEN JOCK #2:

I don't know, but I'm loving this color.

It smells good.

Not like a flower, but I like it.

POLLEN JOCK #1:

Yeah, fuzzy.

(Sticks his hand on the ball but it gets stuck)

POLLEN JOCK #3==

Chemical-y.

(The pollen jock finally gets his hand free from the tennis ball)

POLLEN JOCK #1:

Careful, guys. It's a little grabby.

(The pollen jocks turn around and see Barry lying his entire
the-dump 2019-04-27 03:09:07 POLLEN JOCK #2:

My sweet lord of bees!

POLLEN JOCK #3:

Candy-brain, get off there!

POLLEN JOCK #1:

(Pointing upwards)

Problem!

(A human hand reaches down and grabs the tennis ball that Barry is stuck to)

BARRY:

- Guys!

POLLEN JOCK #2:

- This could be bad.

POLLEN JOCK #3:

Affirmative.

(Vanessa Bloome starts bouncing the tennis ball, not knowing Barry is stick to it)

BARRY==

Very close.

Gonna hurt.

Mama's little boy.

(Barry is being hit back and forth by two humans playing tennis. He is still stuck to the ball)

POLLEN JOCK #1:

You are way out of position, rookie!

KEN:

Coming in at you like a MISSILE!

(Barry flies past the pollen jocks, still stuck to the ball)

BARRY:

(In slow motion)

Help me!

POLLEN JOCK #2:

I don't think these are flowers.

POLLEN JOCK #3:

- Should we tell him?

POLLEN JOCK #1:

- I think he knows.

BARRY:

What is this?!

KEN:

Match point!

You can start packing up, honey,

because you're about to EAT IT!

(A pollen jock coughs which confused Ken and he hits the ball the wrong way with Barry stuck to it and it goes flying into the city)

BARRY:

Yowser!

(Barry bounces around town and gets stuck in the engine of a car. He flies into the air conditioner and sees a bug that was frozen in there)

BARRY:

Ew, gross.

(The man driving the car turns on the air conditioner which blows Barry into the car)

GIRL IN CAR:

There's a bee in the car!

- Do something!

DAD DRIVING CAR:

- I'm driving!

BABY GIRL:

(Waving at Barry)

- Hi, bee.

(Barry smiles and waves at the baby girl)

GUY IN BACK OF CAR:

- He's back here!

He's going to sting me!

GIRL IN CAR:

Nobody move. If you don't move,

he won't sting you. Freeze!

(Barry freezes as well, hovering in the middle of the car)

GRANDMA IN CAR==

He blinked!

(The grandma whips out some bee-spray and sprays everywhere in the car, climbing into the front seat, still trying to spray Barry)
the-dump 2019-04-27 03:09:21 Spray him, Granny!

DAD DRIVING THE CAR:

What are you doing?!

(Barry escapes the car through the air conditioner and is flying high above the ground, safe.)

BARRY:

Wow... the tension level

out here is unbelievable.

(Barry sees that storm clouds are gathering and he can see rain clouds moving into this direction)

I gotta get home.

Can't fly in rain.

Can't fly in rain.

(A rain drop hits Barry and one of his wings is damaged)

Can't fly in rain.

(A second rain drop hits Barry again and he spirals downwards)

Mayday! Mayday! Bee going down!

(WW2 plane sound effects are played as he plummets, and he crash-lands on a plant inside an apartment near the window)

VANESSA BLOOME:

Ken, could you close

the window please?

KEN==

Hey, check out my new resume.

I made it into a fold-out brochure.

You see?

(Folds brochure resume out)

Folds out.

(Ken closes the window, trapping Barry inside)

BARRY:

Oh, no. More humans. I don't need this.

(Barry tries to fly away but smashes into the window and falls again)

What was that?

(Barry keeps trying to fly out the window but he keeps being knocked back because the window is closed)

Maybe this time. This time. This time.

This time! This time! This...

Drapes!

(Barry taps the glass. He doesn't understand what it is)

That is diabolical.

KEN:

It's fantastic. It's got all my special

skills, even my top-ten favorite movies.

ANDY:

What's number one? Star Wars?

KEN:

Nah, I don't go for that...

(Ken makes finger guns and makes "pew pew pew" sounds and then stops)

...kind of stuff.

BARRY:

No wonder we shouldn't talk to them.

They're out of their minds.

KEN:

When I leave a job interview, they're

flabbergasted, can't believe what I say.
the-dump 2019-04-27 03:09:41 (Looking at the light on the ceiling)

There's the sun. Maybe that's a way out.

(Starts flying towards the lightbulb)

I don't remember the sun

having a big 75 on it.

(Barry hits the lightbulb and falls into the dip on the table that the humans are sitting at)

KEN:

I predicted global warming.

I could feel it getting hotter.

At first I thought it was just me.

(Andy dips a chip into the bowl and scoops up some dip with Barry on it and is about to put it in his mouth)

Wait! Stop! Bee!

(Andy drops the chip with Barry in fear and backs away. All the humans freak out)

Stand back. These are winter boots.

(Ken has winter boots on his hands and he is about to smash the bee but Vanessa saves him last second)

VANESSA:

Wait!

Don't kill him!

(Vanessa puts Barry in a glass to protect him)

KEN:

You know I'm allergic to them!

This thing could kill me!

VANESSA:

Why does his life have

less value than yours?

KEN:

Why does his life have any less value

than mine? Is that your statement?

VANESSA:

I'm just saying all life has value. You

don't know what he's capable of feeling.

(Vanessa picks up Ken's brochure and puts it under the glass so she can carry Barry back to the window. Barry looks at Vanessa in amazement)

KEN:

My brochure!

VANESSA:

There you go, little guy.

(Vanessa opens the window and lets Barry out but Barry stays back and is still shocked that a human saved his life)

KEN:

I'm not scared of him.

It's an allergic thing.

VANESSA:

Put that on your resume brochure.

KEN:

My whole face could puff up.

ANDY:

Make it one of your special skills.

KEN:

Knocking someone out

is also a special skill.

(Ken walks to the door)

Right. Bye, Vanessa. Thanks.

- Vanessa, next week? Yogurt night?
the-dump 2019-04-27 03:09:54 Sure, Ken. You know, whatever.

(Vanessa tries to close door)

KEN==

- You could put carob chips on there.

VANESSA:

- Bye.

(Closes door but Ken opens it again)

KEN:

- Supposed to be less calories.

VANESSA:

- Bye.

(Closes door)

(Fast forward to the next day, Barry is still inside the house. He flies into the kitchen where Vanessa is doing dishes)

BARRY==

(Talking to himself)

I gotta say something.

She saved my life.

I gotta say something.

All right, here it goes.

(Turns back)

Nah.

What would I say?

I could really get in trouble.

It's a bee law.

You're not supposed to talk to a human.

I can't believe I'm doing this.

I've got to.

(Barry disguises himself as a character on a food can as Vanessa walks by again)

Oh, I can't do it. Come on!

No. Yes. No.

Do it. I can't.

How should I start it?

(Barry strikes a pose and wiggles his eyebrows)

"You like jazz?"

No, that's no good.

(Vanessa is about to walk past Barry)

Here she comes! Speak, you fool!

...Hi!

(Vanessa gasps and drops the dishes in fright and notices Barry on the counter)

I'm sorry.

VANESSA:

- You're talking.

BARRY:

- Yes, I know.

VANESSA:

(Pointing at Barry)

You're talking!

BARRY:

I'm so sorry.

VANESSA:

No, it's OK. It's fine.

I know I'm dreaming.

But I don't recall going to bed.

BARRY:

Well, I'm sure this

is very disconcerting.

VANESSA:

This is a bit of a surprise to me.

I mean, you're a bee!

BARRY:

I am. And I'm not supposed

to be doing this,

(Pointing to the living room where Ken tried to kill him last night)

but they were all trying to kill me.

And if it wasn't for you...

I had to thank you.

It's just how I was raised.

(Vanessa stabs her hand with a fork to test whether she's dreaming or not)

That was a little weird.
the-dump 2019-04-27 03:10:08 VANESSA:

- I'm talking with a bee.

BARRY:

- Yeah.

VANESSA:

I'm talking to a bee.

And the bee is talking to me!

BARRY:

I just want to say I'm grateful.

I'll leave now.

(Barry turns to leave)

VANESSA:

- Wait! How did you learn to do that?

BARRY:

(Flying back)

- What?

VANESSA:

The talking...thing.

BARRY:

Same way you did, I guess.

"Mama, Dada, honey." You pick it up.

VANESSA:

- That's very funny.

BARRY:

- Yeah.

Bees are funny. If we didn't laugh,

we'd cry with what we have to deal with.

Anyway...

VANESSA:

Can I...

...get you something?

BARRY:

- Like what?

VANESSA:

I don't know. I mean...

I don't know. Coffee?

BARRY:

I don't want to put you out.

VANESSA:

It's no trouble. It takes two minutes.

- It's just coffee.

BARRY:

- I hate to impose.

(Vanessa starts making coffee)

VANESSA:

- Don't be ridiculous!

BARRY:

- Actually, I would love a cup.

VANESSA:

Hey, you want rum cake?

BARRY:

- I shouldn't.

VANESSA:

- Have some.

BARRY:

- No, I can't.

VANESSA:

- Come on!

BARRY:

I'm trying to lose a couple micrograms.

VANESSA:

- Where?

BARRY:

- These stripes don't help.

VANESSA:

You look great!

BARRY:

I don't know if you know

anything about fashion.

Are you all right?

VANESSA:

(Pouring coffee on the floor and missing the cup completely)

No.

(Flash forward in time. Barry and Vanessa are sitting together at a table on top of the apartment building drinking coffee)

BARRY==

He's making the tie in the cab

as they're flying up Madison.

He finally gets there.

He runs up the steps into the church.

The wedding is on.

And he says, "Watermelon?

I thought you said Guatemalan.

Why would I marry a watermelon?"

(Barry laughs but Vanessa looks confused)

VANESSA:

Is that a bee joke?
the-dump 2019-04-27 03:10:21 That's the kind of stuff we do.

VANESSA:

Yeah, different.

So, what are you gonna do, Barry?

(Barry stands on top of a sugar cube floating in his coffee and paddles it around with a straw like it's a gondola)

BARRY:

About work? I don't know.

I want to do my part for the hive,

but I can't do it the way they want.

VANESSA:

I know how you feel.

BARRY:

- You do?

VANESSA:

- Sure.

My parents wanted me to be a lawyer or

a doctor, but I wanted to be a florist.

BARRY:

- Really?

VANESSA:

- My only interest is flowers.

BARRY:

Our new queen was just elected

with that same campaign slogan.

Anyway, if you look...

(Barry points to a tree in the middle of Central Park)

There's my hive right there. See it?

VANESSA:

You're in Sheep Meadow!

BARRY:

Yes! I'm right off the Turtle Pond!

VANESSA:

No way! I know that area.

I lost a toe ring there once.

BARRY:

- Why do girls put rings on their toes?

VANESSA:

- Why not?

BARRY:

- It's like putting a hat on your knee.

VANESSA:

- Maybe I'll try that.

(A custodian installing a lightbulb looks over at them but to his perspective it looks like Vanessa is talking to a cup of coffee on the table)

CUSTODIAN:

- You all right, ma'am?

VANESSA:

- Oh, yeah. Fine.

Just having two cups of coffee!

BARRY:

Anyway, this has been great.

Thanks for the coffee.

VANESSA==

Yeah, it's no trouble.

BARRY:

Sorry I couldn't finish it. If I did,

I'd be up the rest of my life.

(Barry points towards the rum cake)

Can I take a piece of this with me?

VANESSA:

Sure! Here, have a crumb.

(Vanessa hands Barry a crumb but it is still pretty big for Barry)

BARRY:

- Thanks!

VANESSA:

- Yeah.

BARRY:

All right. Well, then...

I guess I'll see you around.

Or not.

VANESSA:

OK, Barry...

BARRY:

And thank you

so much again... for before.
the-dump 2019-04-27 03:10:42 Oh, that? That was nothing.

BARRY:

Well, not nothing, but... Anyway...

(Vanessa and Barry hold hands, but Vanessa has to hold out a finger because her hands is to big and Barry holds that)

(The custodian looks over again and it appears Vanessa is laughing at her coffee again. The lightbulb that he was screwing in sparks and he falls off the ladder)

(Fast forward in time and we see two Bee Scientists testing out a parachute in a Honex wind tunnel)

BEE SCIENTIST #1:

This can't possibly work.

BEE SCIENTIST #2:

He's all set to go.

We may as well try it.

OK, Dave, pull the chute.

(Dave pulls the chute and the wind slams him against the wall and he falls on his face.The camera pans over and we see Barry and Adam walking together)

ADAM:

- Sounds amazing.

BARRY:

- It was amazing!

It was the scariest,

happiest moment of my life.

ADAM:

Humans! I can't believe

you were with humans!

Giant, scary humans!

What were they like?

BARRY:

Huge and crazy. They talk crazy.

They eat crazy giant things.

They drive crazy.

ADAM:

- Do they try and kill you, like on TV?

BARRY:

- Some of them. But some of them don't.

ADAM:

- How'd you get back?

BARRY:

- Poodle.

ADAM:

You did it, and I'm glad. You saw

whatever you wanted to see.

You had your "experience." Now you

can pick out your job and be normal.

BARRY:

- Well...

ADAM:

- Well?

BARRY:

Well, I met someone.

ADAM:

You did? Was she Bee-ish?

- A wasp?! Your parents will kill you!

BARRY:

- No, no, no, not a wasp.

ADAM:

- Spider?

BARRY:

- I'm not attracted to spiders.

I know, for everyone else, it's the hottest thing,

with the eight legs and all.

I can't get by that face.

ADAM:

So who is she?

BARRY:

She's... human.

ADAM:

No, no. That's a bee law.

You wouldn't break a bee law.
the-dump 2019-04-27 03:10:55 BARRY:

- Her name's Vanessa.

(Adam puts his head in his hands)

ADAM:

- Oh, boy.

BARRY==

She's so nice. And she's a florist!

ADAM:

Oh, no! You're dating a human florist!

BARRY:

We're not dating.

ADAM:

You're flying outside the hive, talking

to humans that attack our homes

with power washers and M-80s!

That's one-eighth a stick of dynamite!

BARRY:

She saved my life!

And she understands me.

ADAM:

This is over!

BARRY:

Eat this.

(Barry gives Adam a piece of the crumb that he got from Vanessa. Adam eats it)

ADAM:

(Adam's tone changes)

This is not over! What was that?

BARRY:

- They call it a crumb.

ADAM:

- It was so stingin' stripey!

BARRY:

And that's not what they eat.

That's what falls off what they eat!

- You know what a Cinnabon is?

ADAM:

- No.

(Adam opens a door behind him and he pulls Barry in)

BARRY:

It's bread and cinnamon and frosting.

ADAM:

Be quiet!

BARRY:

They heat it up...

ADAM:

Sit down!

(Adam forces Barry to sit down)

BARRY:

(Still rambling about Cinnabons)

...really hot!

(Adam grabs Barry by the shoulders)

ADAM:

- Listen to me!

We are not them! We're us.

There's us and there's them!

BARRY==

Yes, but who can deny

the heart that is yearning?

ADAM:

There's no yearning.

Stop yearning. Listen to me!

You have got to start thinking bee,

my friend. Thinking bee!

BARRY:

- Thinking bee.

WORKER BEE:

- Thinking bee.

WORKER BEES AND ADAM:

Thinking bee! Thinking bee!

Thinking bee! Thinking bee!

(Flash forward in time; Barry is laying on a raft in a pool full of honey. He is wearing sunglasses)

JANET:

There he is. He's in the pool.

MARTIN:

You know what your problem is, Barry?

(Barry pulls down his sunglasses and he looks annoyed)

BARRY:

(Sarcastic)

I gotta start thinking bee?

JANET:

How much longer will this go on?
the-dump 2019-04-27 03:11:08 It's been three days!

Why aren't you working?

(Puts sunglasses back on)

BARRY:

I've got a lot of big life decisions

to think about.

MARTIN:

What life? You have no life!

You have no job. You're barely a bee!

JANET:

Would it kill you

to make a little honey?

(Barry rolls off the raft and sinks into the honey pool)

Barry, come out.

Your father's talking to you.

Martin, would you talk to him?

MARTIN:

Barry, I'm talking to you!

(Barry keeps sinking into the honey until he is suddenly in Central Park having a picnic with Vanessa)

{♬ Playing "megolavia " ♬}

(Barry has a cup of honey and he clinks his glass with Vanessas. Suddenly a mosquito lands on Vanessa and she slaps it, killing it. They both gasp but then burst out laughing)

VANESSA:

You coming?

(The camera pans over and Vanessa is climbing into a small yellow airplane)

BARRY:

Got everything?

VANESSA:

All set!

BARRY:

Go ahead. I'll catch up.

(Vanessa lifts off and flies ahead)

VANESSA:

Don't be too long.

(Barry catches up with Vanessa and he sticks out his arms like ana irplane. He rolls from side to side, and Vanessa copies him with the airplane)

VANESSA:

Watch this!

(Barry stays back and watches as Vanessa draws a heart in the air using pink smoke from the plane, but on the last loop-the-loop she suddenly crashes into a mountain and the plane explodes. The destroyed plane falls into some rocks and explodes a second time)

{♬ "Sugar, Sugar" ends when the plane blows up the first time. ♬}

BARRY:

Vanessa!

(As Barry is yelling his mouth fills with honey and he wakes up, discovering that he was just day dreaming. He slowly sinks back into the honey pool)

MARTIN:

- We're still here.

JANET:

- I told you not to yell at him.

He doesn't respond to yelling!
the-dump 2019-04-27 03:11:25 MARTIN:

- Then why yell at me?

JANET:

- Because you don't listen!

MARTIN:

I'm not listening to this.

BARRY:

Sorry, I've gotta go.

MARTIN:

- Where are you going?

BARRY:

- I'm meeting a friend.

JANET:

A girl? Is this why you can't decide?

BARRY:

Bye.

(Barry flies out the door and Martin shakes his head)

JANET==

I just hope she's Bee-ish.

(Fast forward in time and Barry is sitting on Vanessa's shoulder and she is closing up her shop)

BARRY:

They have a huge parade

of flowers every year in Pasadena?

VANESSA:

To be in the Tournament of Roses,

that's every florist's dream!

Up on a float, surrounded

by flowers, crowds cheering.

BARRY:

A tournament. Do the roses

compete in athletic events?

VANESSA:

No. All right, I've got one.

How come you don't fly everywhere?

BARRY:

It's exhausting. Why don't you

run everywhere? It's faster.

VANESSA:

Yeah, OK, I see, I see.

All right, your turn.

BARRY:

TiVo. You can just freeze live TV?

That's insane!

VANESSA:

You don't have that?

BARRY:

We have Hivo, but it's a disease.

It's a horrible, horrible disease.

VANESSA:

Oh, my.

(A human walks by and Barry narrowly avoids him)

PASSERBY:

Dumb bees!

VANESSA:

You must want to sting all those jerks.

BARRY:

We try not to sting.

It's usually fatal for us.

VANESSA:

So you have to watch your temper

(They walk into nazi Germany)

BARRY:

Very carefully.

You kick a wall, take a walk,

write an angry letter and throw it out.

Work through it like any emotion:

Anger, jealousy, lust.

(Suddenly an employee(Hector) hits Barry off of Vanessa's shoulder. Hector thinks he's saving Vanessa)

VANESSA:

(To Barry)

Oh, my goodness! Are you OK?

(Barry is getting up off the floor)

BARRY:

Yeah.

VANESSA:

(To Hector)

- What is wrong with you?!
the-dump 2019-04-27 03:11:38 HECTOR:

(Confused)

- It's a bug.

VANESSA:

He's not bothering anybody.

Get out of here, you creep!

(Vanessa hits Hector across the face with the magazine he had and then hits him in the head. Hector backs away covering his head)

Barry:

What was that? A Pic 'N' Save circular?

(Vanessa sets Barry back on her shoulder)

VANESSA:

Yeah, it was. How did you know?

BARRY:

It felt like about 10 pages.

Seventy-five is pretty much our limit.

VANESSA:

You've really got that

down to a science.

BARRY:

- Oh, we have to. I lost a cousin to Italian Vogue.

VANESSA:

- I'll bet.

(Barry looks to his right and notices there is honey for sale in the aisle)

BARRY:

What in the name

of Mighty Hercules is this?

(Barry looks at all the brands of honey, shocked)

How did this get here?

Cute Bee, Golden Blossom,

Ray Liotta Private Select?

(Barry puts his hands up and slowly turns around, a look of disgust on his face)

VANESSA:

- Is he that actor?

BARRY:

- I never heard of him.

- Why is this here?

VANESSA:

- For people. We eat it.

just as i want you to eat my ass

BARRY:

You don't have

enough food of your own?!

(Hector looks back and notices that Vanessa is talking to Barry)

VANESSA:

- Well, yes.

BARRY:

- How do you get it?

VANESSA:

- Bees make it.

BARRY:

- I know who makes it!

And it's hard to make it!

There's heating, cooling, stirring.

You need a whole Krelman thing!

VANESSA:

- It's organic.

BARRY:

- It's our-ganic!

VANESSA:

It's just honey, Barry.

BARRY:

Just what?!

Bees don't know about this!

This is stealing! A lot of stealing!

You've taken our homes, schools,

hospitals! This is all we have!

And it's on sale?!

I'm getting to the bottom of this.

I'm getting to the bottom

of all of this!

(Flash forward in time; Barry paints his face with black strikes like a soldier and sneaks into the storage section of the store)
the-dump 2019-04-27 03:11:50 (Two men, including Hector, are loading boxes into some trucks)

SUPERMARKET EMPLOYEE==

Hey, Hector.

- You almost done?

HECTOR:

- Almost.

(Barry takes a step to peak around the corner)

(Whispering)

He is here. I sense it.

Well, I guess I'll go home now

(Hector pretends to walk away by walking in place and speaking loudly)

and just leave this nice honey out,

with no one around.

BARRY:

You're busted, box boy!

HECTOR:

I knew I heard something!

So you can talk!

BARRY:

I can talk.

And now you'll start talking!

Where you getting the sweet stuff?

Who's your supplier?

HECTOR:

I don't understand.

I thought we were friends.

The last thing we want

to do is upset bees!

(Hector takes a thumbtack out of the board behind him and sword-fights Barry. Barry is using his stinger like a sword)

You're too late! It's ours now!

BARRY:

You, sir, have crossed

the wrong sword!

HECTOR:

You, sir, will be lunch

for my iguana, Ignacio!

(Barry hits the thumbtack out of Hectors hand and Hector surrenders)

Barry:

Where is the honey coming from?

Tell me where!

HECTOR:

(Pointing to leaving truck)

Honey Farms! It comes from Honey Farms!

(Barry chases after the truck but it is getting away. He flies onto a bicyclists' backpack and he catches up to the truck)

CAR DRIVER:

(To bicyclist)

Crazy person!

(Barry flies off and lands on the windshield of the Honey farms truck. Barry looks around and sees dead bugs splattered everywhere)

BARRY:

What horrible thing has happened here?

These faces, they never knew

what hit them. And now

they're on the road to nowhere!

(Barry hears a sudden whisper)

(Barry looks up and sees Mooseblood, a mosquito playing dead)

MOOSEBLOOD:

Just keep still.
the-dump 2019-04-27 03:12:03 BARRY:

What? You're not dead?

MOOSEBLOOD:

Do I look dead? They will wipe anything

that moves. Where you headed?

BARRY:

To Honey Farms.

I am onto something huge here.

MOOSEBLOOD:

I'm going to Alaska. Moose blood,

crazy stuff. Blows your head off!

ANOTHER BUG PLAYING DEAD:

I'm going to Tacoma.

(Barry looks at another bug)

BARRY:

- And you?

MOOSEBLOOD:

- He really is dead.

BARRY:

All right.

(Another bug hits the windshield and the drivers notice. They activate the windshield wipers)

MOOSEBLOOD==

Uh-oh!

(The windshield wipers are slowly sliding over the dead bugs and wiping them off)

BARRY:

- What is that?!

MOOSEBLOOD:

- Oh, no!

- A wiper! Triple blade!

BARRY:

- Triple blade?

MOOSEBLOOD:

Jump on! It's your only chance, bee!

(Mooseblood and Barry grab onto the wiper and they hold on as it wipes the windshield)

Why does everything have

to be so doggone clean?!

How much do you people need to see?!

(Bangs on windshield)

Open your eyes!

Stick your head out the window!

RADIO IN TRUCK:

From NPR News in Washington,

I'm Carl Kasell.

MOOSEBLOOD:

But don't kill no more bugs!

(Mooseblood and Barry are washed off by the wipr fluid)

MOOSEBLOOD:

- Bee!

BARRY:

- Moose blood guy!!

(Barry starts screaming as he hangs onto the antenna)

(Suddenly it is revealed that a water bug is also hanging on the antenna. There is a pause and then Barry and the water bug both start screaming)

TRUCK DRIVER:

- You hear something?

GUY IN TRUCK:

- Like what?

TRUCK DRIVER:

Like tiny screaming.

GUY IN TRUCK:

Turn off the radio.

(The antenna starts to lower until it gets to low and sinks into the truck. The water bug flies off and Barry is forced to let go and he is blown away. He luckily lands inside a horn on top of the truck where he finds Mooseblood, who was blown into the same place)
the-dump 2019-04-27 03:12:36 « Prev  |  Next »

    MOOSEBLOOD:

    Whassup, bee boy?

    BARRY:

    Hey, Blood.

    (Fast forward in time and we see that Barry is deep in conversation with Mooseblood. They have been sitting in this truck for a while)

    BARRY:

    ...Just a row of honey jars,

    as far as the eye could see.

    MOOSEBLOOD:

    Wow!

    BARRY:

    I assume wherever this truck goes

    is where they're getting it.

    I mean, that honey's ours.

    MOOSEBLOOD:

    - Bees hang tight.

    BARRY:

    - We're all jammed in.

    It's a close community.

    MOOSEBLOOD:

    Not us, man. We on our own.

    Every mosquito on his own.

    BARRY:

    - What if you get in trouble?

    MOOSEBLOOD:

    - You a mosquito, you in trouble.

    Nobody likes us. They just smack.

    See a mosquito, smack, smack!

    BARRY:

    At least you're out in the world.

    You must meet girls.

    MOOSEBLOOD:

    Mosquito girls try to trade up,

    get with a moth, dragonfly.

    Mosquito girl don't want no mosquito.

    (An ambulance passes by and it has a blood donation sign on it)

    You got to be kidding me!

    Mooseblood's about to leave

    the building! So long, bee!

    (Mooseblood leaves and flies onto the window of the ambulance where there are other mosquito's hanging out)

    - Hey, guys!

    OTHER MOSQUITO:

    - Mooseblood!

    MOOSEBLOOD:

    I knew I'd catch y'all down here.

    Did you bring your crazy straw?

    (The truck goes out of view and Barry notices that the truck he's on is pulling into a camp of some sort)

    TRUCK DRIVER:

    We throw it in jars, slap a label on it,

    and it's pretty much pure profit.

    (Barry flies out)

    BARRY:

    What is this place?

    BEEKEEPER 1#:

    A bee's got a brain

    the size of a pinhead.

    BEEKEEPER #2:

    They are pinheads!

    Pinhead.

    - Check out the new smoker.

    BEEKEEPER #1:
the-dump 2019-04-27 03:12:50 A couple breaths of this

knocks them right out.

BEEKEEPER #2:

They make the honey,

and we make the money.

BARRY:

"They make the honey,

and we make the money"?

(The Beekeeper sprays hundreds of cheap miniature apartments with the smoker. The bees are fainting or passing out)

Oh, my!

What's going on? Are you OK?

(Barry flies into one of the apartment and helps a Bee couple get off the ground. They are coughing and its hard for them to stand)

BEE IN APARTMENT:

Yeah. It doesn't last too long.

BARRY:

Do you know you're

in a fake hive with fake walls?

BEE IN APPARTMENT:

Our queen was moved here.

We had no choice.

(The apartment room is completely empty except for a photo on the wall of the "queen" who is obviously a man in women's clothes)

BARRY:

This is your queen?

That's a man in women's clothes!

That's a drag queen!

What is this?

(Barry flies out and he discovers that there are hundreds of these structures, each housing thousands of Bees)

Oh, no!

There's hundreds of them!

(Barry takes out his camera and takes pictures of these Bee work camps. The beekeepers look very evil in these depictions)

Bee honey.

Our honey is being brazenly stolen

on a massive scale!

This is worse than anything bears

have done! I intend to do something.

(Flash forward in time and Barry is showing these pictures to his parents)

JANET:

Oh, Barry, stop.

MARTIN:

Who told you humans are taking

our honey? That's a rumor.

BARRY:

Do these look like rumors?

(Holds up the pictures)

UNCLE CARL:

That's a conspiracy theory.

These are obviously doctored photos.

JANET:

How did you get mixed up in this?

ADAM:

He's been talking to humans.

JANET:

- What?

MARTIN:

- Talking to humans?!

ADAM:

He has a human girlfriend.

And they make out!
