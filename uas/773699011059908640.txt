creations-chat 2021-02-02 19:09:49 Please dont be bias and downvote because you dont like the show
creations-chat 2021-02-02 19:12:17 I wish people would stop being bias
creations-chat 2021-02-02 19:14:19 What facts they didnt say anything. They kinda cant.
creations-chat 2021-02-03 00:56:15 I am iron man

creations-chat 2021-02-03 17:15:07 Alright so i got 6 downvotes. So whats the feedback. How do i improve it
creations-chat 2021-02-03 17:17:07 Damn....
creations-chat 2021-02-04 15:59:01 Rate my new bumblebee <#384025409945337856>. This time it can walk and it doesnt only fold in half
creations-chat 2021-02-04 16:01:52 But i didnt rip off anything : (
creations-chat 2021-02-04 16:03:55 Fine then how do i improve it. (AND MAKE IT SPECIFIC) because the first version yall just said its only 2 colors and it cant walk. I added more detail and made it walk and now its still bad. So how do i make it good enough.
creations-chat 2021-02-04 16:05:56 YOU THINK I COPIED HIM!?!? I DIDNT EVEN KNOW THAT WAS THERE. SO ITS NOT RIPPING OFF A CREATION.
creations-chat 2021-02-04 16:08:44 first, didnt downvote his, and second i was watching transformers the movie like 1 hour before i decided to make bumblebee. And third, i didnt even vote on his. fourth, its not his original creation he is modeling bumblebee and so was i
creations-chat 2021-02-04 16:10:45 You know those are facts thats why you said ‚Äúsure‚Äù
creations-chat 2021-02-04 16:27:22 Bumblebee failed üò¶
creations-chat 2021-02-04 16:34:07 Welp i have a better creation ive been working on
creations-chat 2021-02-04 16:36:21 Lot of detail on the ww2 but it was just like i was not amazed i just saw a tv of somekind if thats what it is
creations-chat 2021-02-04 16:44:52 Alright im finally done with the kai fighter <#384025409945337856>
creations-chat 2021-02-04 16:46:53 will you stop downvoting the reference picture i clearly said ‚Äùdont down vote its an example of what i built‚Äù
creations-chat 2021-02-04 16:48:55 Oops mb imma delete it i didnt know we couldnt post reference images
creations-chat 2021-02-04 16:50:56 prob not me cause i barely voted that much builds. I remember only voting like 3 builds and only one was a downvote
creations-chat 2021-02-04 17:39:16 That rafale is good i dont know who bullied it of somekindi upvoted it : )
creations-chat 2021-02-04 17:42:30 check out tesla roadster 2.0 <#384025409945337856> , it is detailed as far as the gamn physics would let me and also comes with the pop up spoiler feature like irl
creations-chat 2021-02-04 17:47:16 he edited so late. And yes its the bullpupped one
creations-chat 2021-02-04 17:52:50 i didnt say clearly that people where bullying him he just said help about something so he bullpuped his rafale but if its offensive than ok
creations-chat 2021-02-04 18:03:05 Thanks it took me a week to make it
creations-chat 2021-02-04 18:05:18 Not fully a week i mean like 2 days planning it out and the rest building it. Like 4 days
creations-chat 2021-02-04 18:07:22 How is that cap. Do you mean it took me longer or it took me 1 day or somthing
creations-chat 2021-02-04 18:09:49 So thats what you meant... ididnt take all day on it if you want heo many minute than lets say about half an hour than
creations-chat 2021-02-04 18:42:17 Oop. I knew it was coming
creations-chat 2021-02-04 18:46:21 <@!652786436428398603> the truck....was not it. You did good on the back but the front part looked nothing like a truck. And a tip, the amount of blocks doesnt define your build, so you dont have to say it
creations-chat 2021-02-04 18:48:52 HOW AM I SALTY. I WASNT EVEN MEAN. you guys are more harsh than me you guys just traight up say its ‚Äútrash‚Äú then downvote. I gave him advice on how to improve and said he did good on the back part
creations-chat 2021-02-04 18:51:28 üòï üëé not funny......
creations-chat 2021-02-04 18:54:18 I feel you erik used to i never got passed 2 votes. But the build i just posted a while ago got 5 its my new record. btw i upvoted for you too
creations-chat 2021-02-05 13:44:17 Isnt that just one of the tutorial bombers. I seen many people with it <#384025409945337856> the green bomber. I swear ive seen so many people with it and they have the black plus sign on each wing. He just added a hut of somekind
creations-chat 2021-02-05 13:47:18 LMAAOOOOO my grandpa has that truck instead its black <#384025409945337856>
creations-chat 2021-02-05 13:49:56 Yo thats one of the best bombers i ever seen if its not a bomber then the best plane i ever seen. It doesnt even look like you used blocks from the game it looks real
creations-chat 2021-02-05 13:52:54 Bruh i swear ive seen it before. This has to be a tutorial but he made the wings different so no one will notice. But i notices the black plus sign and seen it on many other bombers that looked exactly like this one <#384025409945337856>
creations-chat 2021-02-05 13:55:00 I KNEW IT so i might not be a tutorial but i was still right about the black plus sign being on many other planes which looked exactly like that one so its half credit. Yes half credit of the theory
creations-chat 2021-02-05 14:07:47 WHY IS EVERYONE PINGING ME I GOT 8 PINGS
creations-chat 2021-02-05 14:09:49 Why are they replying to me IF 2 PEOPLE ALREADY DID AND I WAS OFF THAT TOPIC. LATE PEOPLE THESE DAYS....GOSH
creations-chat 2021-02-05 14:12:46 Ye i dont BUT WHEN THEY REPLIED, NONE OF THEM EVEN TOLD ME ABOUT WW2 THEY JUST SAID ‚Äúthats the only way to make it‚Äù
creations-chat 2021-02-05 14:15:06 Why so many downvotes. Gosh..... Duuuude i stopped talking about it long time ago you guys keep bringing it up. <@!347918144062488586>  <@!658318819248570381> no it was 3 minutes ago
creations-chat 2021-02-05 14:19:15 SPAMMING? ARE YOU SERIOUS!?!? Yall litterally tried to get me in trouble when i didnt do anything i wasnt spamming. Yall just kept bringing up the situation that i was done with
creations-chat 2021-02-05 14:27:20 Bruh. Are you frickin kidding me. I just said this conversation is over. ‚ÄúIm not talking to you‚Äù but you are damn talking about me. That happened like an hour ago just leave it alone.
creations-chat 2021-02-05 14:30:48 how about you stop pinging me <@!781206492187590656>
creations-chat 2021-02-05 14:33:08 It just looks like one of those quick builds
the-dump 2021-02-05 14:35:07 You got to be kidding me
the-dump 2021-02-05 14:35:30 The hell is that is it some kind of juice
the-dump 2021-02-05 14:35:54 funnyuns wont tast good as a juice
the-dump 2021-02-05 14:36:02 ?
the-dump 2021-02-05 14:36:25 Eh ok
creations-chat 2021-02-05 14:42:21 Amazing plane, loved the figure and the wing shape. The fact that the wing can move to adjust the flight is just amazing i upvoted!
creations-chat 2021-02-05 14:45:33 Im not gonna say its bad but its just not all that good. I cant see what it is. I know what it is since you said it but it looks nothing like a mouse probably pictures from a different angle will change my opinion but from this angle i guess its supposed to be a dark space ship
creations-chat 2021-02-05 14:49:49 First. How is my rep ruined i did nothing and second who deleted my message
creations-chat 2021-02-05 14:52:02 Ok and? Im not a big ww2 fan i never planned on studying it. So your saying just because i didnt know some history people downvote? i thought the votes were supposed to be if your build is good or not. People cant just down vote you because they dont like you.
creations-chat 2021-02-05 15:01:44 ‚ÄúDidnt look that good‚Äù Dude this guy made a block with like 9 to 12 motors around it and it got so many upvotes. I made a helicopter that flys from the custom propeller under it and got 19 downvotes
creations-chat 2021-02-05 15:04:38 Im not whining tho making my text more specific besically i said ‚Äú how is my build not good I made something very cool. And everyone hated it. A random guy made a 1 minute thing (block and motors) and got praised
creations-chat 2021-02-05 15:07:05 But like i actually put effort. If you dont think its good doesnt mean you have to assume i put no effort
creations-chat 2021-02-05 15:16:59 i understand you. But what feedback. I usually dont get any. I only get this feedback ‚Äúyou didnt out any effort‚Äù ‚Äúyour build is trash‚Äù ‚Äúits not that good‚Äù I dont get feedback that helps me improve my build. They just make it sound like im never gonna be a good builder
creations-chat 2021-02-05 15:19:43 My save slot is full. Half of them already got downvotes. and a quarter of them i dont think is good enough to get upvotes. But i like those builds. I have a dime left of builds to show.
creations-chat 2021-02-05 15:26:34 This was an argument? I thought of it as a reasonable confersation
creations-chat 2021-02-06 18:29:00 First. Motor locks doesnt give your build credit. Its just how accurate and good it looks. Ill upvote it tho it looks good <@!475737938643386370>
creations-chat 2021-02-06 18:32:22 Its good but you can improve. Do less of the bulk and more of the slim imma show you in diff channel go to plane crazy
creations-chat 2021-02-06 23:22:30 Yeah that soundwave. With the tenticles and all
creations-chat 2021-02-07 01:42:52 <@!523003901075521536> is it lack of effort? Is it not accurate? did i copy from someone else? Why is it that you downvoted? Cause you gave me no feedback.....i have a feeling you just dont like it for no reason.
creations-chat 2021-02-07 01:56:57 Why must my builds have motor lock other peoples builds get so many votes and they dont have motor lock
creations-chat 2021-02-07 01:59:15 INACCURACY!?!? its not like you even know the show. i build is very accurate. so he just spoke for everyone i guess my build is getting downvoted because they just dont like it. Might as well delete it : (
creations-chat 2021-02-07 19:40:04 everytime i go offline i come back in an hour or the next day and in this channel someone pinged me. But i never find it
creations-chat 2021-02-08 14:36:55 Damn why yall hating on starscream
creations-chat 2021-02-08 14:38:58 Ye it is a f-15 stroke eagle but its the starscream version.  <@!565376886843244544> dude thats not the one i did
creations-chat 2021-02-08 22:48:27 Check out my ferrarie monza ps2. Took me a while to make it. Give me feedback if its not good üôÇ
creations-chat 2021-02-08 22:51:51 <@456226577798135808> so just shade it in different red and its worthy for an upvote
creations-chat 2021-02-08 22:53:56 <@!404731699033931786>  The head.... make it compatible with the body. The head is so big and the rest of the body is small. Shrink the width of the head
creations-chat 2021-02-26 17:48:15 Im back,its been a while, i know you didnt miss me so dont say anything at all if you didnt
creations-chat 2021-02-26 17:51:27 Uh no....., do you see creations blacklist on my name?
creations-chat 2021-02-26 17:53:28 I just did..... <#384025409945337856>
creations-chat 2021-02-26 17:58:48 Sorry i posted so many pics its because they took out select pictures. Remeber (DONT VOTE ON ACCURACY) this is stricly a pre build and the extra parts are coming later. All i want is your vote on if its startinf off good
creations-chat 2021-02-26 18:01:11 I feel you bro, they always tell you whats bad and never say how to improve
creations-chat 2021-02-26 18:05:30 I didnt ask for feedback i meant for harsnavary. And didnt i strictly say that it was a pre version and high accuracy was not the main goal of this build. Im gonna add more detail later
creations-chat 2021-02-26 18:12:12 Eh......
creations-chat 2021-02-26 18:25:22 Thanks

creations-chat 2022-04-21 17:49:38 I know its plane crazy but it looks more realistic. motor lock users... -_-
