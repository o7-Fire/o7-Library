creations-chat 2023-04-25 12:38:34 Idk... it does kind of like... not "ruin" the look of the build, but it does definitely stand out maybe just a bit too much on your builds 
(no offense)
But I do definitely agree, people are just homophobic
creations-chat 2023-04-25 12:41:46 Idk some builds of theirs do stand out quite a bit, but it is their build so idk, if they are posting it in creations n stuff to be rated, that's what people do, rate it...

creations-chat 2023-05-04 01:42:31 yeah, this community is like punching people in the face when people try to join it.
creations-chat 2023-05-04 02:00:16 thats my entire point.
creations-chat 2023-05-04 02:38:24 its not #betoxictopeoplepostingincreations
creations-chat 2023-05-04 02:41:27 jeez i think you needa calm down 💀 , its not that i think every build should be upvoted, very clearly there are builds that are not "Up to standards" but downvoting some of them are unreasonable and when people ask for feedback about it, they get nothing but people being toxic to them.
creations-chat 2023-05-04 02:44:32 thats fair if you dont like the build, but when someone asks for feedback about the build and all you say is "get better" "L" "mid interior" then there is definitely something wrong about the community there
creations-chat 2023-05-04 10:32:16 i luv ur cute fox 😊
