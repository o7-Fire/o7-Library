bug-reports 2022-04-04 17:18:38 Is this a bug, or am I just stupid. Because there's no reason I'd have 4 types of Pontoons and not the other who knows how many
bug-reports 2022-04-04 17:18:58 Did you have to collect them seperate or what?
bug-reports 2022-04-04 17:20:14 And I'm pretty sure it's been like this for a long time, I just never really cared because I didn't need them at that time
bug-reports 2022-04-04 17:23:27 I only have 4 for some reason
bug-reports 2022-04-04 17:23:36 I want to start actually using them but I can't
bug-reports 2022-04-04 17:23:40 I literally have the frotns
bug-reports 2022-04-04 17:23:50 I'm asking if it's a bug or did you have to collect each one

bug-reports 2022-04-04 17:26:36 I'm so confused on why I have only four
bug-reports 2022-04-04 17:29:12 Also how will that help
bug-reports 2022-04-04 17:29:41 Ok but I still can't get what I need from it
bug-reports 2022-04-04 17:29:45 I can't just fix the script
bug-reports 2022-04-04 17:30:14 I already rejoined, and I mentioned the issue persisting for a while
bug-reports 2022-04-04 17:31:24 Oh, I actually think it was multiple
bug-reports 2022-04-04 17:31:29 My bad then
