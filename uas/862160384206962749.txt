creations-chat 2022-08-18 06:11:56 I love watching the arrogant playing around like a clown
creations-chat 2022-08-18 06:14:11 Does this convince you?
creations-chat 2022-08-18 06:17:07 Cuz Tomcat is gone, and F35 can’t carry weapons externally.
The Navy planned to accompany the Tomcat and the Hornet as partners. But the budget was cut after ussr oofed.
creations-chat 2022-08-18 06:19:37 Integrated fuel tank, upgraded radar, equipped with enclosed weapon pod, Super Hornet BLK IiI can carry 3 of its.

And in response and as an add on, F35 don’t carry weapon externally if it want to maintain it stealth.
creations-chat 2022-08-18 06:22:05 Logical, the plane is stealth, but not the weapons
You either choose external weapons in exchange of stealth.
Or stealth in exchange of external weapons.
creations-chat 2022-08-18 06:24:27 A 4th or 4.5th gen can do the job at a cheaper cost, then why should you let a 5th gen to do it?
creations-chat 2022-08-18 06:29:23 I understand your point. Sometimes there’re situation that allow 5th gen to carry weapon externally.
But in general, and as I mentioned, 4th or 4.5th gen can do the job at a lower cost. 4.5th gen are fighter that adopted some of the 5th gen requirements in the design. Fuselage of 4th gen, but engines and technology from 5th genTherefore, make it an existence between 4th and 5th gen. F15EX, F/A18 Super Hornet Block III, Dassault Rafale, KF-21, Su-35 are the example
creations-chat 2022-08-18 06:31:30 Not the US, but Lockheed Martin, they’re the one who manufacture and profit from it.
creations-chat 2022-08-18 06:34:35 The complexity of the structure makes the maintenance a pain in the ass, plus that thing weigh 800kg, equal to 2x MK83 1000lbs bombs. Dogfighting with 2x 1000lbs bombs tied to your jet is not a good idea.
creations-chat 2022-08-18 06:41:14 The B1 has the advantage of speed, obviously, powered by 4x General Electric F101 turbofan afterburner engines. As well as payload. But as a bomber designed from the last century, it focuses on breaching enemy’s air defense through low altitude and supersonic. Which obviously, doesn’t work as well as it used to be nowadays. And as mentioned, maintaining the swept wings is pain. However I think they retire the B1 to give space for the B21.
creations-chat 2022-08-18 06:45:04 Now ima wait for another 100 years and witness how air combat turn into ace combat.

creations-chat 2022-08-20 04:59:48 This gun is… idk what to say, a little better than the HK416 cuz 2800 of default muzzle velocity is higher than HK416’s 2500.
creations-chat 2022-08-20 05:56:00 According to the blueprint, the width of the intake appears to be 1/2 the width of the canopy. Therefore, if the nose is 3 blocks wide, then the intake should be 1.5 block wide, but does it look like it tho? I feel like the width is 2/3 the width of the canopy.
creations-chat 2022-08-20 06:13:54 So, does it look close to the blueprint? I don’t trust my eyes
creations-chat 2022-08-20 06:18:47 So, if my nose is 3 blocks wide, then the 1.5 intake would work
help 2022-08-21 07:18:20 Apparently, you cannot achieve dual keybinds control of the elevator by putting 2 motor 2 head to head… which I understand, pain in the ass.
In order to solve this, I have 2 options for you:
One: instead of using 1 key to control 1 movement, such as W to pitch up. You can try to use 2 keys. Instead of placing W/S as the key bind, you can try W/A for one and S/D for another. So if you want to pitch you press 2 keys like W and D or S and A. If you want to roll using elevator, you can press W and S for left or A and D for right.
Second option is more complex while building and looks bad but you won’t have to reset your muscle memory, you can use a set of locked motor, place vertically, attack one motor 2 controlling W/S or A/D, doesn’t matter, to the one head of the motor lock and another motor for W/S if you placed A/D before already, or A/D if you placed W/S before already. Then attack panels to the outer motor 2 and it should solve the problem.
creations-chat 2022-08-25 02:16:02 I wonder where did I go wrong with the nose…
creations-chat 2022-08-25 02:22:16 Making the tomcat, but the nose, I can’t describe, it’s like too chunky. And it’s a 3 wide
bug-reports 2022-08-25 06:06:11 Rick, I hope you see this and fix this issue. I used the same setting for 4 motors, but when I spawn in and angle lock them, they all rotate at different rate, like, not united at all. Thank you very much.
Yours sincerely.

help 2022-11-21 06:43:30 Basically the compressor cannot compress air to a pre calculated pressure, so the air cannot continue to advance into the ignition chamber, which then caused the process to be disrupted, boom, dead engine.

help 2022-11-21 06:57:34 That’s the fin blade, which serves the purpose to help redirect the turbulence flow generated by the edge wings away from the root of the rudder to avoid distress, a compensation to the aerodynamic specialty but also a flaw of the early Hornet
help 2022-11-21 07:02:27 And so Boeing redesigned the Hornet, change the intake from the early oval shape to the Galette intake (also used by the Raptor), new F414, and larger wing surfaces and a new edge wing design, which completely redirected the turbulence flow away from the root of rudder without the existence of fin blade. But it also caused disruption to the airflow under the wings, weapons now have a chance to collide into the fuselage while dropping. Boeing’s solution to that: angle the weapon racks for 3 degrees. Avoided that risk, but in exchange of terrible drag.

help 2022-11-23 04:44:15 Mind post a picture?
help 2022-11-23 04:47:05 That makes it clear, it is necessary to have sufficient elevator’s surface area to alter air flow in order to maneuver the plane
help 2022-11-23 04:49:51 You’re left with 3 options:
1) Increase the elevator’s surface area by making it bigger, but in exchange of more energy loss per move
2) Reduce the wing components in the centre of the wings, also help with reducing drag and increase the turning rate
3) Add a reasonable amount of propellers to assist with the maneuvering. Not too many that it becomes too heavy and spinning too fast that put the plane in a Russian roulette, and not too few that it help a little. This solution can also be adopted to simulate thrust vectoring.

creations-chat 2022-11-24 07:13:52 The platform already destined that it can’t carry much payload, nor having space for future upgrades. So far most players I’ve encountered  (not everyone I’m referring to, you know who your are the best, so don’t apply it to you if you consider it’s not applicable, in another word: don’t take the shit on you) mod the fighters with conveyor boost since the terrible turn rate destined that there would be little room for mistake (they afraid to lose).

I once thought I would never bring this up again to avoid unnecessary troubles, yet I found this is necessary. I’m hereby declaring that everything I’m about to say is fact and it has not been altered by any means.

Short: they send agent to spy on your server. Why? Je he sais pas, how am I suppose to know the true motive behind?

Long: I joined the server, everything went well for the first day. Until the second day, the mod brought up a humiliation on me privately in DM for absolutely no reason. First he/she (iel) judge my age. I found that was ridiculous that the mod just assume your age and consider that assumption as a fact. Then, the mod physically told me to: “get tf out of nam nam’s server”, another example for horrible customer support, do not apply that to your occupation unless you want to be squid gamed from your job. What really rise my blood pressure was he blatantly demonstrated the screenshots he got from my server, which includes conversation between members, group’s info,… and he brag that he is going to report it to nam nam. I was back then, questioning how the hell did I let this guy slip in, plus who do they think they are that they believe they have the right to justify people like that. According to Discord’s Community guidelines, and ongoing law, an action which steal information without consent will be identified as a crime. Like who do they think they are! Overlord of Discord? A wake up call is necessary to wake those irrational ordinaries.

creations-chat 2023-05-09 05:50:02 I would go for the B-1 or Tu-160, PC doesn’t have radar so stealth wouldn’t save you from being bullied.
creations-chat 2023-05-09 05:52:21 Or just go with multi-role fighter, can also get the jobs done whiteout risking your life.

creations-chat 2023-05-09 06:18:45 I don’t see anything wrong, but you have only two 4th gen aircrafts. Try to add another one, like Typhoon or Rafale
bug-reports 2023-05-18 02:41:03 Impressive coding, Rick. Watch, look at it, look and reflect on yourself. How much longer do you want the whole community to endure such miserable consequences from your tardiness? Like look, look at what your game has become. Don't you have the slightest sense of guilt witnessing all of these? Countless builds are failing because of all of these built-up errors, and have you done anything to resolve them? Does acknowledging the fact that some social tumours wreak havoc in your own game makes you feel comfortable? I suppose not. You know yourself the best, I'm hereby stating the voice of a small fragment of this community. By the very least, please give it a view, have some respect and honour your dignity. Time is running out, you either nail it on time and earn a win-win, or lose everything that you devoted your effort into.

creations-chat 2023-05-27 06:11:28 Pay attention to the word “speculated”. Cuz that’s how I know it will be delayed further.
creations-chat 2023-05-27 06:13:52 But let just say that it would be a shame for rickje if he is going to discredit his reputation any further. I mean, so far his prestige is hanging on the edge.
