The Tale of ibu422 (306324877588037633)
bug-reports 2020-04-12 07:06:47 ive noticed that every now and then, when you go into "fly" mode and come back to build mode, it wont allow you to choose the build menu or the edit menu. youll just be stuck on the build menu without being able to choose any subsection (thrusters, wings etc) or place any blocks
bug-reports 2020-04-12 07:07:21 id post evidence, but its kinda just me standing there jiggling my mouse
creations-chat 2020-10-12 09:19:21 we need attachers instead of detachers
bug-reports 2020-10-13 07:11:00 cant get a screenshot for this, but everytime i use motor 2's for massive turrets they allways wobble around massively, instead of snapping right to where my mouse is. sometimes if the build is too big, it gets into an infininte loop of spining in a circle
creations-chat 2020-10-13 07:32:55 my newest creation

bug-reports 2020-12-14 10:41:17 i cant really show a pic of this, but i cant sprint, open settings, or see through my own blocks in fly mode

creations-chat 2021-09-25 03:40:21 any advice on making my interior more cluttered without it looking too crappy? its for a AC130/globemaster hybrid
creations-chat 2021-09-25 03:42:44 maybe make the body a couple shades lighter, and make the underside quite a lot brighter than the top
creations-chat 2021-10-05 08:51:27 someone rate my bones

they do ccurve inwards like a C-shape, but its only a difference of 3-4 blocks throughout, so its unnoticable from that view

i need help giving my sculpture some... *flavour*... so it dosent look like crap
creations-chat 2021-10-05 09:43:41 update:

creations-chat 2021-10-05 09:50:22 judging off of the reference image...

most likely not.
creations-chat 2021-10-05 09:58:44 last update of the day/night

creations-chat 2021-10-06 01:04:08 should i spend 5 hours adding wedges to my meat "man"

or is it good enough with only blocks for its main body (the spikes are wedges)

<@!464634048279478282> but h o w
creations-chat 2021-10-06 01:07:18 how would i "smooth" out parts like this? i don't think using corner wedges/ corner wedge blocks will do the trick alone, and that's as far as my smoothing knowledge goes for things of this scale
creations-chat 2021-10-06 01:13:18 i wedged a small portion

i guess its ***S L I G H T L Y*** less blocky, but i still don't know if I want to wedge the whole thing
