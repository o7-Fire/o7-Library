The Tale of spydarkopix (798181566370545744)
creations-chat 2021-11-12 20:49:57 Since my f4e phantom kinda looks bad I'm looking for some tips to improve it (there is no motorlock)
creations-chat 2021-11-12 20:51:59 It's so the wings can be at an angle and I didn't wanna use half blocks
creations-chat 2021-11-13 07:35:49 mini yf-23
creations-chat 2021-11-13 07:38:00 mb mb shouldve said it was glitched mouse
creations-chat 2021-11-13 07:50:02 i fixed the horizontal/vertical wings being blocky
creations-chat 2021-11-13 07:52:12 cheese grater wings are best compatible with my type of control, glitched mouse
creations-chat 2021-11-13 07:55:06 excuse me? ive been using glitched mouse since day 1 and im not throwing that experience away for a less smooth, janky type of control
creations-chat 2021-11-13 07:57:17 interesting but i dont rlly think i have space on this build, i will probably try that later
creations-chat 2021-11-13 09:01:33 i just replaced the weapons on my yf 23 with hover engines and it goes 4000 with minimal shake lol
creations-chat 2021-11-13 17:04:14 i made this su 33 a few hours ago and i think i might need to improve the design so im looking for design tips on this or advice on how to fix it
creations-chat 2021-11-13 17:06:53 oh the problem is wing panels decrease the control on glitched mouse GREATLY so i think i might have to keep them (btw i also have canards on there)
creations-chat 2021-11-13 17:25:57 ive never done that before
creations-chat 2021-11-13 19:14:55 Also what's wrong with exposed motorlock I actually think it looks quite nice and I'm boutta die
creations-chat 2021-11-13 19:17:29 Eh yeah sure
creations-chat 2021-11-13 19:19:50 I kinda like builds with some exposed motor locks because to me it kinda looks steampunkish
creations-chat 2021-11-13 19:22:53 Fair enough but maybe the right amount looks ok? But I do still agree with you and also hars, I think being harsh is better for more development in a build so I do kinda appreciate it
creations-chat 2021-11-13 19:30:19 I need some feedback on my su 33 because I think it kind of looks garbage plus idk how to do advanced motor locking like angle locking
creations-chat 2021-11-13 19:32:27 Oh boy
creations-chat 2021-11-14 03:32:00 improved my su 33
creations-chat 2021-11-14 03:34:06 ill try making a smaller version for sure, it didnt turn out good looking at all in my opinion but it does work really well for pvp so sure i will rn
creations-chat 2021-11-14 03:36:13 how do i do it like that? also nice su lol
creations-chat 2021-11-14 03:38:25 8 blocks in total not including the half wedge things on there
creations-chat 2021-11-14 03:49:21 making a new su 33 rn but smaller got any tips to make the spine better tho?
creations-chat 2021-11-14 03:53:31 ive never done angle locking before but sure ill try it
creations-chat 2021-11-14 04:01:08 i just tried to angle lock and failed horribly
creations-chat 2021-11-14 04:06:15 hey before i start angle locking im gonna do easier angle locking before the hard stuff k?
creations-chat 2021-11-14 04:17:23 just made a custom engine for practice but the wedges keep glitching and returning back to normal, how do i fix this?
creations-chat 2021-11-14 04:20:39 ok thanks for the tip
creations-chat 2021-11-14 05:56:10 cursed custom futuristic jet thingy
creations-chat 2021-11-14 09:16:56 this is the only jet ive made with a perfected camo (CFA-44)
creations-chat 2021-11-14 11:27:25 improved placement of the front stabilizers and added afterburners
creations-chat 2021-11-14 11:30:06 still but how do i cover em?
creations-chat 2021-11-14 11:32:46 i use motor lock on this but also weep if i do wing panels it makes it so unresponsive to turns
creations-chat 2021-11-14 11:36:15 thats what those front flaps do btw also its glitched mouse + some custom flaps
creations-chat 2021-11-14 11:40:05 hm ok
creations-chat 2021-11-14 11:42:21 just tried to motor lock disconnectors but its too low to fit with the control surfaces is there a way to solve this
creations-chat 2021-11-14 11:55:04 the circling in the front yeah i have those but i use glitched mouse too so idk of i can do that without having to do wasd which i dont really like as much as glitched mouse and wasd so im gonna use half blocks to do the covering up
creations-chat 2021-11-14 12:18:58 cheese gone?
creations-chat 2021-11-14 19:27:50 I agree with you, builds really don't need an inside cuz it just wastes time, like what are you even gonna do with the inside if its not visible from the outside
creations-chat 2021-11-14 19:32:46 Should I just quit posting here cuz all ppl have to say to my jets is "cheesegrader1!!1!1!1!!1" I'm not getting real advice
creations-chat 2021-11-14 19:35:08 I don't really know if I have a pic rn but all you need to know is it's a cfa 44 with cheesegrader wings
creations-chat 2021-11-14 19:37:11 I'm going to try this tommorow becuase it is my only option for now.. I'm not so sure if it will work tho
creations-chat 2021-11-14 19:40:41 Wouldn't it be so much easier for us glitched mouse users if they had a non cheesegrader version of control surfaces

<@456226577798135808>  same man
creations-chat 2021-11-16 14:36:38 aha (this is kind of a joke build)
creations-chat 2021-11-16 14:42:14 a funny
creations-chat 2021-12-14 13:34:29 finally back to plane crazy, made this thing (Eurofighter Typhoon) (not sorry for cheesegrater wings)
creations-chat 2021-12-14 13:37:55 i still havent learnt how to angle lock so ill probably just do that now
creations-chat 2021-12-14 13:40:48 now im thinking about if coming back to the game was a horrible mistake
creations-chat 2021-12-14 13:52:46 hey also do you have any like tips for proportions like can i plan in some way?
thanks
creations-chat 2021-12-14 14:31:44 thank god
creations-chat 2021-12-23 21:47:54 Ahaha, lack of detail. What a classic

I may be stupid but what is a walkway
creations-chat 2021-12-23 21:50:37 Hars has quite the bad reputation here

Back at it at Krispy Kreme
creations-chat 2021-12-23 21:52:44 But why

Give me a reason
creations-chat 2021-12-23 21:55:12 Because it's a tradition

(For you at least)
creations-chat 2021-12-23 21:57:49 Couldn't think of a better word don't mind
creations-chat 2021-12-23 22:07:37 I found a post where hars is the only downvoter other than the bot

creations-chat 2021-12-28 09:02:56 mig 29, someone tell me if im a dumbass for not painting it and posting it here
creations-chat 2021-12-28 09:05:23 how do i make a 1x2 pyramid wedge then (i think i can fix the wings though)
creations-chat 2021-12-28 09:09:31 i like small builds but yes bigger = more detail
creations-chat 2021-12-28 09:11:37 ah shit, here we go again

<@!723940197456281640>  i see
creations-chat 2021-12-28 09:58:22 <@!723940197456281640>  i have no idea if i improved the wings or not, it looks weird to me

<@!784764238409105419> its supposed to be a mig 29
creations-chat 2021-12-28 10:00:38 nice

also im gonna slowly improve it like adding angled intakes next
creations-chat 2021-12-28 10:03:09 i have literally no idea on how im gonna make them look like that
creations-chat 2021-12-28 10:15:35 that just doesnt look okay for a mig 29 for some reason

there is no round part on that wing
creations-chat 2021-12-28 10:20:26 when

i think there is too much r o u n d on my mig 29's wings tho
creations-chat 2021-12-28 10:24:07 eh not bad

angle locking

buut i dont wanna do angle locking
creations-chat 2021-12-28 10:50:29 what are those afterburners why are they BLUE
creations-chat 2021-12-28 11:01:13 it looks weird and yes i do

<@!723940197456281640>  yes indeed and it is getting worse
creations-chat 2021-12-28 11:04:28 Clearly, you are wrong

also btw i used super rocket engines like a year ago but quickly realized hover engines were a thing


<@!712273624865701921>  Clearly, you use a laptop for plane crazy
creations-chat 2021-12-28 11:07:50 besides the weird afterburners i think it looks good because short and the engines look pretty nice
creations-chat 2021-12-28 11:11:56 pog
creations-chat 2021-12-28 11:14:33 sure

hold on but whatever su or mig that thing is its not a tu22m anyway
creations-chat 2021-12-28 11:16:59 i think on the adfx 02 there are blue afterburners too
creations-chat 2021-12-28 11:19:52 still cool

creations-chat 2022-01-05 10:10:17 sadly this applies to small jets too
creations-chat 2022-01-07 12:06:27 first time angle locking, to me it looks kinda bad (eurofighter typhoon)
creations-chat 2022-01-07 12:10:15 the only thing i hate about this is the fact that the stick thing on the end of the wings are crooked so ill try to fix that somehow
creations-chat 2022-01-07 12:26:05 why does the guy have to be such a moron ive never seen anyone that toxic in pcc
