help 2022-11-22 22:00:15 ok ill try that
help 2022-11-22 22:01:16 dont work
creations-chat 2022-11-22 22:39:40 hey, the su 57 "felon" is farther along than the su 75 "misdemeanor" su 57not a full prototype either, it has serial models, i mean you cant use the fact that its a prototype as an excuse, when it has serial models. but i dont think that its just some haha trash plane either
creations-chat 2022-11-22 22:44:11 in all fairness too, you cant really say that the reason the production has slowed is because of sanctions, when the sanctions pre february 24 were somewhat modest, and its introduction was 2 years ago
creations-chat 2022-11-22 22:54:24 yeah, but that was because of software limitations preventing it from stressing airframe - build quality is a different story
creations-chat 2022-11-22 22:58:13 i suppose so, since both platforms still have upgrades prepared, but i think that part of the problem is the capacity to churn out the same quality as the usa (1/10 defense budget bc usa got those dollaridoos) also i just realized we arent really discussing posts in <#384025409945337856>

creations-chat 2022-11-22 23:11:31 lol its fine

help 2022-11-22 23:32:13 well firstly i was gonna try and make a su 35
help 2022-11-22 23:32:20 and have that back bit behind cockpit angle locked
help 2022-11-22 23:32:23 couldnt do that
help 2022-11-22 23:32:28 barely got outta my own head
help 2022-11-22 23:32:36 secondly i tried to make an f18
help 2022-11-22 23:32:40 yeah su 35 spine
help 2022-11-22 23:32:48 i dont know how where to place the thing
help 2022-11-22 23:32:49 like
help 2022-11-22 23:32:54 do i build the whole build
help 2022-11-22 23:32:57 or
help 2022-11-22 23:32:57 and then stick motorlock on it
help 2022-11-22 23:33:00 do i build motorlock
help 2022-11-22 23:33:03 and then the build around it
creations-chat 2022-11-22 23:56:34 his rank is literally just getting a score of 90 on a creation wdym lol
yeah, how can the rank be undeserved if what makes you deserving of the rank is a score of 90? if you think thats undeserved then its just your standards are too high, thats all
creations-chat 2022-11-22 23:59:08 it wasnt a problem with the f-35, its turning problems were on purpose. a g force limiter was put in place to prevent it from stressing the airframe since it was an early model. its not a problem of the early model
creations-chat 2022-11-23 00:01:58 sorry ive never heard that before, can u tell me where u got from? not tryna be aggressive
creations-chat 2022-11-23 00:28:17 maneuverability is important, but being able to do something like a cobra isnt since like cmon, are you really gonna use all your speed on one chance
creations-chat 2022-11-23 00:35:58 cobras are cool

help 2022-12-03 16:48:04 ik abt the exposed motorlock
help 2022-12-03 16:48:10 but itll prob be hidden inside fuselage
creations-chat 2022-12-03 16:51:46 ive never used angle lock, camera lock, or piston lock and now im trying to put real effort into an f14 and im soo excited to have to make a labyrinth just to get the wings working, because i have a terrible skill issue
help 2022-12-03 16:56:20 but its different for the top
help 2022-12-03 16:56:27 1 sec lemme show u
help 2022-12-03 16:56:54 see those trapdoors arent attached to half block
help 2022-12-03 16:57:04 but what im looking at for the bottom is different
help 2022-12-03 16:57:24 i cant attach anything to that wedge because theres no attachment point there
help 2022-12-03 16:57:37 i could try and circumvent it using some block to attach it, like a trail
help 2022-12-03 16:57:41 but the thing is
help 2022-12-03 16:57:43 if i use a trapdoor
help 2022-12-03 16:57:49 the trail cant reach it without touching half block
help 2022-12-03 16:57:55 wdym
help 2022-12-03 16:58:04 idk how else to make a 1.5x2 intake
help 2022-12-03 16:58:06 its not 1x2
help 2022-12-03 16:58:24 ik i couldve tried to half the half block wedge directly attach to the main wedge
help 2022-12-03 16:58:30 but that would create more motorlock problems
help 2022-12-03 16:58:44 so if i try and place a trapdoor there it touches the half block, thereby not covering up the whole thing
help 2022-12-03 16:58:49 and if i put a disconnector
help 2022-12-03 16:58:56 
help 2022-12-03 16:59:00 then it attaches to other disconnectors
help 2022-12-03 16:59:13 wait a minute
help 2022-12-03 16:59:18 i think i have the stupid
help 2022-12-03 16:59:56 what orientation
help 2022-12-03 17:00:11 
help 2022-12-03 17:00:21 
help 2022-12-03 17:00:46 but those touch the other half blocks on the side
help 2022-12-03 17:01:02 it broke the motorlock
help 2022-12-03 17:01:08 lemme show more images
help 2022-12-03 17:01:24 
help 2022-12-03 17:01:29 
help 2022-12-03 17:01:32 so the line of half blocks there
help 2022-12-03 17:01:42 its attached to those wing panels so that it covers up the intakes better
help 2022-12-03 17:01:50 yeah
help 2022-12-03 17:02:36 i think i might be able to
help 2022-12-03 17:02:43 replace the disconnectors on the bottom with trapdoors
help 2022-12-03 17:02:46 since that might give better clearance
help 2022-12-03 17:02:48 but im not sure
help 2022-12-03 17:06:46 an f14
help 2022-12-03 17:06:50 first plane im putting effort into
creations-chat 2022-12-03 21:22:36 my finally finished 1.5x2 intake, i hope i can hide that exposed motorlock inside fuselage
creations-chat 2022-12-03 21:26:02 excuse me i know its bad
fr tho i can probably hide the exposed motorlock since that is a left side intake
embarassed to say it took like 2 hours of playtime to make that
creations-chat 2022-12-03 21:30:11 pretty much but that small gap is ugly

also the way to fix it was painfully obvious i tried just about everything imaginable except for placing a half triangle wedge
creations-chat 2022-12-03 21:34:34 stick a compass emoji in text on there or something
several compass emojis
creations-chat 2022-12-03 21:39:23 say what you will about the (unfinished) plane itself, but its an improvement over the 2nd image (last plane i made)
creations-chat 2022-12-03 23:10:31 i improved my weird f14 fuselage to have a more defined curve
creations-chat 2022-12-03 23:28:56 who did
creations-chat 2022-12-04 16:02:03 i should def raise the intake
creations-chat 2022-12-04 16:31:53 are the intakes too far back?
creations-chat 2022-12-04 16:50:44 alr ty
creations-chat 2022-12-05 22:59:41 might be the first build im not embarassed to say is mine (even though its not exactly... good)
creations-chat 2022-12-06 00:53:06 how make the intakes extend farther back (its not exposed motorlock just part of the motorlock isnt connected, ill connect it after this post) (note how the intakes dont go as far back as the fewselage)
creations-chat 2022-12-06 21:49:26 wow how did you learn to type considering that youre a bird?

amazing
creations-chat 2022-12-08 21:25:03 stolen creation (you didnt model)

\
creations-chat 2022-12-10 23:30:42 which f-14 angle is more accurate?ik both of them are big dumb
creations-chat 2022-12-10 23:33:31 i could maybe *dabble* in piston lock to kinda change it more finely but prob not


actually it would probably be pretty easy
creations-chat 2022-12-10 23:44:04 its more slanted? prob smthn to do with my terrible skill issue but uh hm ill try to fix it

do you really think i can decipher thaty ive never used blueprints
creations-chat 2022-12-10 23:49:27 shown here
ohhh you were  talking about the INTAKE i didnt realize
yeah i might try to work on that later by doing some more anglelocking because thats not inclined enough for 1x4 or 0.5*2 wedges and thats also a reason i extended motorlock tower
creations-chat 2022-12-10 23:54:53 btw wheres the source for those blueprints? i wanna look at those since they give more precise images than a 3d model
alr thanks
creations-chat 2022-12-11 00:00:37 i cant find em im on theblueprints .com
creations-chat 2022-12-11 00:49:43 would a half wedge down 1x2 be accurate enough for the intake of an f14
creations-chat 2022-12-11 01:15:24 more anglelocking <:nooo:787097964946259978>

why
creations-chat 2022-12-15 14:59:15 why piston not good option

help 2022-12-15 18:18:55 you could add pontoons but idk how easy that would be to add in

creations-chat 2022-12-16 00:33:48 alr ill try thanks
creations-chat 2022-12-16 00:49:20 is the wing small? i just have a few limitations with what i can do sry
how much longer
like 1.5x longer?
creations-chat 2022-12-16 00:55:11 how much longer
creations-chat 2022-12-16 01:00:59 ok that will be a lil difficult but ill try
help 2022-12-16 01:01:41 can cameras be used as invisible connectors

help 2022-12-16 16:31:59 pls help
help 2022-12-16 16:34:02 also do motor1's work when clipped inside other blocks (and do they work specifically when clipped inside another motor1 with the exact same settings?)
help 2022-12-16 17:17:38 what difference between elevon and taileron control surfaces (tailerons like on f14)

also do normal motors work when motorlocked inside other blocks (and do they work when clipped inside other normal motors if they move at the same time)
help 2022-12-16 17:41:02 ok thanks
help 2022-12-16 17:41:08 i will do that for my f14 then
help 2022-12-16 17:41:46 motor 1 does work when clipped into blocks
help 2022-12-16 17:42:08 same with 2
help 2022-12-16 17:43:05 ok thakn you
help 2022-12-16 17:45:20 yeah this seems to work

help 2022-12-16 17:45:44 imma work on my plane now cya
help 2022-12-16 18:46:03 sorry if i bothered u but they responded
creations-chat 2022-12-16 20:10:34 i added dinghy little flaps

i mean spoilers

but they r a little glitchy so idk
creations-chat 2022-12-16 20:20:05 spoilers not lookin fire rn
creations-chat 2022-12-16 20:37:42 if youre talking abt the nose, the second (but i think thats just a few slight differences in anglelock) 
if youre talking abt length the first
creations-chat 2022-12-16 20:47:23 ill try to make a few configurations and post them
creations-chat 2022-12-16 23:44:15 (the one on the right looks worse than it would be bc it isnt properly angled but still) the left wing looks a little too long but like its just better
creations-chat 2022-12-16 23:51:35 sry for replying so much later is this better?

thanks
creations-chat 2022-12-17 00:04:53 what am i gonna do, put them on top? isnt it gonna be more noticeable?

i mean i could try clipping them inside the wing covers

wdym connect the wings with clear signs? cant i just use like cameras?

wait nvm the hitbox ill just use clear signs
creations-chat 2022-12-17 00:27:25 they dont work when clipped <:empty:794431705070174238>

hmm im gonna try something
creations-chat 2022-12-17 00:32:10 hold on i think that the reason they didnt work was bc of weird connectors

nevermind <:empty:794431705070174238>

nevermind again i think it was but i just didnt forget but instead DIDNT SEE THEM
creations-chat 2022-12-17 00:35:45 it worsk thank you
creations-chat 2022-12-17 00:40:02 hm sorry but i dont think i can clip the motor inside since the way i need to put the motor moves the motor too much and so when it rotates it kinda messes up the position of the wing (notice how with the one below the wing i can put the wing right beside it, but with the one clipped in, since it has to be at the same height, i need to do a weird thing with it to make it properly rotate
creations-chat 2022-12-17 00:43:29 the thing dont line up well and if i try to change the position of the wing itself to make it align when swept, then it gonna be messed up when straight

ill just put motor on top of wing and see if that work
creations-chat 2022-12-17 01:03:01 which one better
creations-chat 2022-12-17 01:06:19 i mean like which one is better, when clipped in or when on bottom? ill try doing the top but i dont think itll be more well hidden. who knows, maybe that'll change after adding vertical stabilizers, but i dont see how it will be more hidden on top? anyways also pls answer original, clipped or bottom
creations-chat 2022-12-17 01:11:04 oh the top as in the top image im so dumb sorry <@761354294859005962>
creations-chat 2022-12-17 01:13:48 once i finish my f14 im gonna upload the last plane i made to creations <:clueless:942802644043464734>

just something for future reference im going to try and put all exposed motorlock i make in hot pink so that its extremely noticeable
would that be cruel or funni?
creations-chat 2022-12-17 01:16:13 ik its actual hot garbage thats why

anyways imma go now since i went offline a bit ago
the-dump 2022-12-17 14:20:26 
creations-chat 2022-12-17 14:52:36 i followed the advice to clip in the motor and i added some horizontal stabs

i had to make some compromises abt wing thickness and placement of the wings when swept to hide the motors better]
creations-chat 2022-12-17 14:55:58 its better than it was before alright? not much of a standard to be held up to but its better nonetheless
creations-chat 2022-12-17 14:59:37 as in like, add exhausts? yeah the back is awful, the exhausts are especially hard for me so im saving those for last (intake is 1.5x2)
creations-chat 2022-12-17 15:11:17 believe me i tried changing sweep but i don’t want to cut more of the wing than i already have
creations-chat 2022-12-17 15:15:10 wdym by that? sorry i just dont understand 

also i think that the reason you see the sweep as not enough is how when swept the wings sorta align with the elevators using delta wing 1x1 (so youd think it swept 45 degrees) but the front of the wing is using 1x4 delta wings so the sweep would only rlly be around 3.75 degrees off the 60 degree sweep on real f14
help 2022-12-17 15:17:42 does the real f14 have all-moving vertical stabilizers? cuz if it does it'd make my life much eaasier
creations-chat 2022-12-17 15:25:17 you know what? i dont care about accuracy, im making all moving vtps for my f14 and thats that
creations-chat 2022-12-17 15:40:59 if im not willing to anglelock or camera lock, whats better for vertical stab, 1x1 or 1x2 delta?
ty
creations-chat 2022-12-17 15:43:39 hmm, if i use 1x2 ill have to make the vertical stabilizer very tall, 6 block tall, just so that it doesnt look way too short.

il prob test some stuff and decide

im goin with 1x1
creations-chat 2022-12-17 15:52:12 it flies
creations-chat 2022-12-17 16:08:35 and now i gotta spend a bit of time thinking abt how i can make an exhaust
help 2022-12-17 16:12:59 ok sorry to bother u but i already decided that im not going thru the trouble of doing proper stabs, im just doing all moving ones
also the roll kinda sucks since i gotta use tailerons and for some reason they super glitchy and dont reach intended angles 90% of the time so the all moving ones are my main source of turning, ailerons arent needed except for smaller corrections
creations-chat 2022-12-17 16:15:58 i think <#384025409945337856> bot broke
help 2022-12-17 16:16:31 ye but ion wanna do effort for pitch/yaw, for roll i might just do that

help 2022-12-17 16:25:42 ok ty since its variable sweep
creations-chat 2022-12-17 16:28:35 you mean my head?

creations-chat 2023-01-05 15:13:26 its not just abt doing the nose properly, if the nose is too detailed compared to the rest of the plane it just looks bad


i think that trail noses can look good but you should only use them if yk how to make the whole plane extremely detailed, if you just pick it up from a tutorial on noses then its gonna look bad because it just makes the rest of the plane look bad
creations-chat 2023-01-05 15:16:09 whats the point of these inner wedges, have you ever used them?
