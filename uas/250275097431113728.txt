creations-chat 2018-11-17 19:34:51 Ive just made a new plane
help 2018-11-17 19:42:52 The plane keeps going left / right when I try to fly it.I checked it and its perfectly balance.Maybe its because of the motors made to move the wings up / down (like the Star-wars fighters).I blocked those with some blocks but the same problems occurs.

bug-reports 2018-11-18 15:57:39 I found out that you cant paint 1x1 delta wing.
bug-reports 2018-11-18 16:12:56 Oh, OK
creations-chat 2018-11-18 16:14:16 <@!386194619354054656>  I got it using paint.net, using the magic tool to select the backround, recolor it with blakc, and use the bursh to paint stars.
creations-chat 2018-11-18 16:16:58 <@!219175600609296394> you just only need to make the wings better. It looks cool tho!

creations-chat 2021-04-27 15:28:57 From what i can tell in the photos, i feel like its a bit too wide. Either that or its too short.
 
For the hull, the back barrels need rework, since they're ugly so far apart from the tank. Maybe you could motorlock them in (still, thats my opinion, dont change it if you dont feel like it).

The IR spotlight looks unrealistic, maybe you could replace the ladders with a .9 block inside, and giving it a ice texture(maybe???, test to see if you like it). 

The smoke launchers could be angled motor locked inside, since i dont think they would be effective at 90*. The Spotlights are also too big, and im not a fan of the wheeled tracks. The engine exshaut could also be improved.

But, besides that, you really nailed the turret and the hull shape, altough, as i said, could be narrowed. The color pallete is also very nice, and the breach shape is intresting.
Hope this helps :D

creations-chat 2021-10-03 19:18:34 the tree in the corner should have snow on it i feel like, its out of place
creations-chat 2021-10-03 19:37:06 <@221487880487436288> could you give me some feedback on whats wrong with the tank
creations-chat 2021-10-03 19:40:19 Hmm while i agree the tank is a bit too tall the turret is good, it might be the perspective (unpainted pic)
creations-chat 2021-10-03 19:42:58 Its 2.5 blocks tall, on earlier variants i had it 3 block tall, and it was too tall, and piston locking it would be an issue since the frontal turret roof is already piston & motor angled
creations-chat 2021-10-03 19:45:01 Well, id consider this a preference instead of a problem, since basically i dont have the space, motors, and server latency left too add them. I'd rather take fake tracks since they dont look bad from other people's perspective while moving
creations-chat 2021-10-03 19:50:16 I honestly dont think its worh they effort making it laggier than it already is, its as optimized i could get (well while keeping the original form since reworking big parts of it would be a waste of time), and even so, it has a 1/10 chances of crashing
creations-chat 2021-10-03 19:54:37 Pepsi has a point, it is indeed a mess, and while its certainly my fault I didn't make space for working threads, its most likely impossible to add working treads on such a motor lock monster. Theres a functionality/detail balance that just doesnt work
creations-chat 2021-10-03 19:58:15 Look the hidropneumatic suspension is just a bit raised ok )
creations-chat 2021-10-03 20:10:28 Thx puri :D
creations-chat 2021-10-03 20:42:12 Uh.. well it barely moves due to the weight so it uses a conveyor engine that gets the job done somewhat but turning is a problem
creations-chat 2021-10-03 20:46:00 Personally, i dont like treads (exept maybe zach/guggi tracks), but because the lag, need for explosive blocks and problems with spawning, looks, and viewer moving descrepancy id rather take wheels over moving tracks

However id rather to fake tracks than wheels
creations-chat 2021-10-03 20:49:18 Not really, for example my style uses either disconnectors or signs to get the tracks look, and above them i make the wheels, making it purely visual and getting the movement done by a conveyor engine. However if you can make some overlapping roadwheels to get the german-style tracks without using tracks
creations-chat 2021-10-03 20:51:48 In case modern mbts i see a lot of people just use wheels, in that case yes add individual suspension
creations-chat 2021-10-21 09:10:59 I did, after taking a closer look its not as good as i thought. The driver optics are a bit too high, and the turret, while i understand is hard to make, is not great either
creations-chat 2021-10-21 09:13:41 Oop wanted to say i revoked my upvote, thats what i thought he ment
creations-chat 2021-10-21 09:18:08 Well i got it wrong, my fault, but i still want to give some feedback on the tank
creations-chat 2021-10-21 09:24:18 First off, there's this motor sticking out, not sure if its fixable on that side but kinda destroys the look, then theres that bag that i feel its a bit too low and its clipping inside the turret (personal preference probably) and also this part which i don't really get
creations-chat 2021-10-21 09:26:53 The original T-55s dont have ejection ports they only appear from the T-62 onwards, i don't really know about the arabic T-55s, but im guessing they dont have them either
creations-chat 2021-10-21 09:29:45 The front is also nicely made the only problem i see is the driver vision ports being raised a bit too hight, you could use piston locking to fix it easily, and the IR Spotlight looks a bit out of touch because of the color (maybe use a darker shade of white?) But overall i really appreciate the front <@718409831639154718>
creations-chat 2021-10-21 10:13:08 Naaa bruhh na no way bruh it be only the extremely advanced syrian shell ejection system no way you just be maddin
