creations-chat 2020-01-02 08:53:54 my roadroller and Sw1ftpr0AnimZ' za warudo
creations-chat 2020-01-06 12:15:34 Ok, so from my observations, if anyone posts their creation they worked hard on, it'll get downvoted to hell, unless it's a fucking airliner
creations-chat 2020-01-06 12:16:42 Or a fucking battleship
creations-chat 2020-01-06 12:17:06 Even though it's like the same three, generic, Yamato, and Nimitz
creations-chat 2020-01-06 12:17:40 Or if it's an Airbus A380, or a warthog, or a generic American fighter jet
creations-chat 2020-01-06 12:18:18 ***from my observations***
creations-chat 2020-01-06 12:20:10 And I don't really agree with you about things getting downvoted just for being blocky
creations-chat 2020-01-06 12:22:09 Yeah, like, if it's a ridiculously huge build, that makes sense
creations-chat 2020-01-06 12:22:38 But it seems to me that "badass" is just a few fighter jets, airliners and battleships
creations-chat 2020-01-06 12:35:34 Sure, I can't post it in this channel coz yeah
creations-chat 2020-01-06 12:47:37 Done
bug-reports 2020-01-06 14:13:18 Not sure what to do, but my good friend MrGloopy has had a ***COLLOSAL*** issue with the game. For some reason, when they joined the game, the game would spawn him in the middle of the map and wouldn't let him load anything, not even a plot was assigned to him. This continued for days, and wouldn't work no matter what, ***BUT NOW*** it's apparently fine, seeing as this is an issue that has existed, I have decided to report it to bring it to awareness in case anyone else is affected by it and isn't as lucky for it to work again
bug-reports 2020-01-06 14:15:06 Edit: sorry <@646380050907791411> for posting after you like that, ***if this is seen, make sure to notice his complaint aswell please***
bug-reports 2020-01-06 14:16:45 <@415036739653074944> with all due respect, I wouldn't bet on your knowledge, because you don't have a part in the programming of the game so you can't be certain that it IS fixed
bug-reports 2020-01-06 14:16:52 Even if you've been told
creations-chat 2020-01-09 10:54:59 <@459749464434016266> to are you using windows 7 or some shit??
