plane-crazy 2020-02-10 12:17:28 Hi guys i have a good idea for plane crazy, you could add a battle mode where you would divide an amount of people into 2 groups, then they could battle that way, lets say team deathmatch, that would make the game much more interesting and your creations would have much more use and you could battle with others that would be amazing!
