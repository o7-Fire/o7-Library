creations-chat 2021-06-23 21:34:32 so if I changed the name of my post to "custom jet" you wouldn't care?
creations-chat 2021-06-23 21:36:35 damn i guess the PCC community really is full of toxic 10yos
creations-chat 2021-06-23 21:39:13 First of all, I'm responding to your toxic, completely unnecessary comment. Second of all, maybe don't continue to confirm my theory that the PCC is full of toxic 10yos?
creations-chat 2021-06-23 21:43:14 tutorials are absolute shit compared to my creations, and yes, insulted. So you agree that you're a toxic 10yo?
creations-chat 2021-06-23 21:45:38 kinda funny coming from someone that's a 10yo themselves. 
and yeah, tutorials are shit. let's take a look at one of your creations, shall we?
creations-chat 2021-06-23 21:49:03 perhaps you could aid us on this quest?
creations-chat 2021-06-23 21:52:19 ahem ahem <@!711009848438947850>
creations-chat 2021-06-23 21:55:08 funny, coming from the one that started the argument

creations-chat 2021-08-31 02:20:25 yeah it's a work in progress, not anywhere near done
creations-chat 2021-08-31 02:23:10 where exactly?
i've already got a few custom angles
creations-chat 2021-08-31 02:27:57 im not too familiar with custom angles

anyways, there's obviously a lot of room for improvement tho i was focused mostly on the rear
creations-chat 2021-08-31 02:32:06 where 

explain

you seem to be more focused on insulting my build rather than telling me how i should improve it
creations-chat 2021-08-31 02:34:07 that's the only thing? pretty easy to fix
creations-chat 2021-09-01 19:30:50 im helping a friend with the mig 21, what do ya'll think

creations-chat 2021-10-07 02:08:07 things like mechanisms are fine
so nothing is wrong with performance builds
but when it comes to a build like a jet
looks are something you should really consider over functionality
creations-chat 2021-10-07 02:15:11 the whole plane isn't bad
u might wanna consider rebuilding certain aspects of ze plane tho

creations-chat 2021-10-23 04:51:39 relatable
creations-chat 2021-10-23 23:58:28 normally, rockets would go faster and farther depending on how fast you were moving, but now you need to turn on legacy to allow that

creations-chat 2021-11-16 23:26:40 bro
do you lack the brainpower to understand
that modified or not 
tutorials are disliked by the community 

oh yeah and it's not a good build lol
creations-chat 2021-11-16 23:35:03 exactly
creativity and innovation is what the pcc is about
and the very nature of tutorials defy that
modified or not

so please
don't even start about creativity
creations-chat 2021-11-16 23:37:10 LMFAO

help 2022-01-05 04:01:36 yeah
i found a way a while ago
but it requires some mechanical components
still pretty simple tho if u wanna see it
creations-chat 2022-01-05 20:14:54 created a concept for mouse guided custom ailerons
ah damn i forgot abt slowmode
gotta wait 2 more mins till i can post a picture
creations-chat 2022-01-05 20:22:33 sry for the bad quality of ze vid
creations-chat 2022-01-05 20:25:43 true
then again
just a concept
i'll probably make improvements in the future 
any way i could make it more compact?
creations-chat 2022-01-05 20:42:49 ah that's another issue
in 3rd person it still follows your mouse
but it's really unstable
creations-chat 2022-01-05 20:50:45 i've tried that
tbh i wouldn't call it unstable
just an irregular flight pattern
creations-chat 2022-01-09 05:33:50 korb
creations-chat 2022-01-11 00:43:28 my first completely original working swashplate

creations-chat 2022-02-20 16:36:49 he's saying "attention (something i cant understand) immediate evacuation"
creations-chat 2022-02-26 04:22:18 reminds me of the amx 12t but without the oscillating turret for some reason
help 2022-03-01 04:49:14 the torque created by the main rotor makes the body spin in the opposite direction
you need the tail rotor to be countering that
creations-chat 2022-03-06 03:06:44 you only need 1 rotor in each corner

to prevent the body from rotating it's as simple as this
creations-chat 2022-03-06 03:11:11 rlly?
in the pics u sent it looks like u have 2 counter rotating rotors in each corner 
or did u do that for the extra lift
