creations-chat 2023-01-31 04:11:38 k. this is my plane nose. its still work in progress. sorry i didnt know i deleted it. also i hate slowchat. its so slow. why so long? btw is there anyone that can help me make a canopy for this? im not good at this. im trying to fit as much as i can into this message because of slowmo chat. anyways i would really appreciate it. also please dont ratio me
creations-chat 2023-01-31 04:27:11 its a combination of multiple airplanes. i dont like copying stuff from real life 1:1.
The background is a custom skybox.
creations-chat 2023-01-31 05:26:28 uh bro? obviously not? i just go into the roblox directory and replace the skyboxes with custom ones. there are multiple tutorials on it. it does not cost performance, is not bannable and makes the game look better
creations-chat 2023-01-31 05:29:02 looks nice.
creations-chat 2023-01-31 05:53:15 uhh the  moon isnt on there? its pandora?

creations-chat 2023-01-31 06:26:47 why
creations-chat 2023-01-31 07:14:43 its literally a combination of jets

plus i never, even once, for 1 second, either aknoÂ´wledge your existance before your message, second of all ask for it. but you have noting better to do than wasting your time on me because u got nothing better to do with your life.
creations-chat 2023-01-31 07:17:19 plus it is not disproportionate. just looks like it on the screenshot
creations-chat 2023-01-31 07:20:01 yea i did. i tried my best but i hadnt played for a few months. got problems?
creations-chat 2023-01-31 07:22:46 you still did not anwser my question, which was why do you think i want to hear your opinion
creations-chat 2023-01-31 22:36:31 thats not what i want. i want the normal control surfaces to be toggleable to i can press a button one and they stay up or down
creations-chat 2023-01-31 22:38:36 thats not what i want. i want the normal control surfaces to be toggleable to i can press a button one and they stay up or down

creations-chat 2023-02-01 06:22:33 progress on my f14 tomcat.
creations-chat 2023-02-01 06:24:47 whats wrong with the cockpit? im gonna post some 360 screenshots.
creations-chat 2023-02-01 06:26:50 360 of the tomcat. please give feedback
creations-chat 2023-02-01 06:28:54 ok i will. does it look good tho?
creations-chat 2023-02-01 06:31:00 here. i gotta go to school so ill be back in about half an hour.
creations-chat 2023-02-01 07:19:07 guys, did this addition make it look better?
creations-chat 2023-02-01 08:10:24 how
creations-chat 2023-02-01 08:26:55 bro its an alright plane shut up.
creations-chat 2023-02-01 08:37:18 it is alright,  no need to hate on him just because hes new/newer. youre just an overall bad human being
creations-chat 2023-02-01 08:39:48 i see many many flaws in yours. plus he never asked

he thinks its glorious which is good. you already made me feel bad because u said my build sucked which i really didnt appreciate, additionally, next time you do so to one of my builds, i will contact staff and report you for being toxic
creations-chat 2023-02-01 08:42:15 being. plus i am not sarcasting. also, not liking a build is not toxic, but being mad about it even after being told i dont want it is toxic, like he did to me, and i really dont like him (because of it)
creations-chat 2023-02-01 08:44:24 it is not toxic to say someones build is bad, but you were extremly toxic when giving critique on my build, as you always are. please have some human decency and shut up when people tell you to.
creations-chat 2023-02-01 08:47:10 i kinda am considering i am autistic but thats not what im on about
creations-chat 2023-02-01 08:50:21 the dish can be good if we consider the fact the person is new at cooking. we dont know the other persons playtime. it might be horrible but it might be good for their first dish
creations-chat 2023-02-01 08:52:55 i mean i would eat it just to be polite.

and to reply to <@495210490172014612> , yes, but you didnt pay for any builds here.
creations-chat 2023-02-01 08:54:57 ur decision
<@849139320106516491> it is either the feces of dogs or something bad,
creations-chat 2023-02-01 08:58:39 well no one cooks dogsht so it obvious which one you meant
creations-chat 2023-02-01 11:33:45 damn daniel
creations-chat 2023-02-01 11:37:19 may get fixed in plane crazy2. not sure and not coming from a dev but since this can be an annoyance, maybe
creations-chat 2023-02-02 00:42:58 f14 Tomcat nose progress. thoughts? btw you can bypass slowchat by editing your message as 2 minutes is really just too much
creations-chat 2023-02-02 00:54:38 youre not goofy enough obviously ðŸ’¯
creations-chat 2023-02-02 01:58:01 yea haha i just did it because it looked kinda cool. haha
creations-chat 2023-02-02 02:20:03 yep definetly (my avatar to scale)
creations-chat 2023-02-02 02:22:04 i like it. thats your opinion. ive always been a fan of the f14. it has a nice design and the foldable wings look aamzing. while yes it might be overrated, ya cant change the fact that it is my favourite jet.
creations-chat 2023-02-02 02:28:01 sure? /just making sure)
creations-chat 2023-02-02 02:34:48 thx. but i think it depends on the model
creations-chat 2023-02-02 04:05:45 the intake is too small right?
creations-chat 2023-02-02 04:15:13 thx
creations-chat 2023-02-02 05:02:41 well i quite literally wasnt trying to make a good build, but a rather weird one.
My builds are generally much better than that.

Phineas and ferb plane guy. i like that name
creations-chat 2023-02-02 05:05:00 i have never tried to get the expert rank. idk how to get it.
creations-chat 2023-02-02 05:07:13 looks alot better than the phineas and ferb jet. doesnt it?
creations-chat 2023-02-02 05:09:23 first of all: i literally started building on this today. 

second of all: what does ''total score''' mean?
creations-chat 2023-02-02 05:11:27 i have a build with 150 or 160 total reactions in <#384025409945337856> (old build)

does that count?
and idk what upvoted-downvotes means. does that mean that you take upvoted minus downvotes?
creations-chat 2023-02-02 05:13:30 https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/384025409945337856/973262719606198302 yea i do. It may have more downvotes than upvotes. but it also is an old build
(and it is still over 150 reactions. like i said.)

<@719807717782454302> i quite literally said TOTAL REACTIONS. not score.
creations-chat 2023-02-02 05:40:49 and i never said it did. you seem to be quite stupid
creations-chat 2023-02-02 05:54:27 because i can
creations-chat 2023-02-02 07:46:43 
creations-chat 2023-02-02 08:00:32 you said it. it is UNFINISHED.. also what is wrong with shaders? makes the game look much better
creations-chat 2023-02-02 08:11:27 i have a gaming pc that can run roblox on maximum graphics settings with 500 fps. please dont worry.
creations-chat 2023-02-02 08:13:32 yea hes my friend too haha. no way lol. just played with him like 2 hours ago. play with him alot,
creations-chat 2023-02-02 08:16:12 bros about to be kicked
creations-chat 2023-02-02 08:50:01 does it look good tho?
creations-chat 2023-02-02 08:53:24 no way haha thats pretty much the first compliment ive gotten in here.
creations-chat 2023-02-02 08:55:31 well if you look at my previous posts. its no wonder. ive really tried making this build look great as i am a fan of the f14. i remade the build i made before this because i wanted my favourite plane to look good
creations-chat 2023-02-02 08:57:38 i dunno. but what exactly r u talking about? havent seen a hayball recently. except the one in the other channel. the video blew my ears out


<@584060481522761728> thats quite literally what i have installed. 
A: my pc costs 1800. 
B: my monitor has a refresh rate of 144 hz, so an fps unlocker is required to really get the best experience.

<@773474989751664640> wait did i post it multiple times?
creations-chat 2023-02-02 13:27:08 i am
creations-chat 2023-02-02 13:29:17 i do? why not? i literally get over 500 fps even with the shaders?
creations-chat 2023-02-02 13:31:29 am having trouble with the shape of the weird thingy on the f14's above the wings
creations-chat 2023-02-02 13:36:21 yea. no custom gear. i couldnt find space for it. plus, i couldnt be bothered to add one, even without, it still looks good. plus, even if i tried, i suck at custom gears, meaning the standart one still looks better
creations-chat 2023-02-02 13:58:29 why? what looks shit
creations-chat 2023-02-02 14:00:41 yea and what else? what does he find so shit about the jet? just because its popular? also, while yes the gear might be small, theres no room to add one, and i dont really care. its rare for me to even include gears (idk why)

You all keep commenting on the gear, but not on my question, which was related to the wing part.
creations-chat 2023-02-02 14:03:03 I WANT A DAMN ANWSER TO THE QUESTION I HAVE ASKED! STOP GIVING ME ADVICE ON STUFF I DID NOT ASK FOR. PLEASE ANWSER THE QUESTION I ACTUALLY ASKED: THIS COMMUNITY IS PISSING ME OFF. EITHER PEOPLE ARE MEAN OR STUPID
creations-chat 2023-02-02 14:06:00 you never actually anwsered the question, or hinted at wanting to anwser it ever, also my nerves are really cut short as this server just keeps insulting me. really fucking hate it
creations-chat 2023-02-02 14:08:36 well you didnt actually anwser it, you just said that the landing gear was too small, which wasnt my question. im sorry for yelling at you, but i am just really pissed off by this server. people keep being little assholes to me for no reason
creations-chat 2023-02-02 14:11:17 https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/504436696021204992/1070697973215920169 was what i wanted to know. immediatly got told it looked shit. for no reason. which is really annoying. i just wanted to know how to make that better. i dont understand why the mods NEVER do anything about it. its literally so annoying. people like ProkillaV5 are just assholes. no hate, but tbh, yea. hate. i just hate it. why are people toxic?
creations-chat 2023-02-02 14:14:28 but its annoying. and i feel like its 70% of the server. some of the assholes are ProKillaV5 and seyofarded. its literally so fucking annoying
creations-chat 2023-02-02 14:20:37 reshade. btw this wasnt a serious build. i just wanted to make a jet that looks like phineas
creations-chat 2023-02-02 14:22:40 4 upvoted and 54 downvotes. were getting to #1 most downvoted built. slowly but steady.

please downvote here: https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/384025409945337856/1070567098025259050
creations-chat 2023-02-02 14:24:42 i mean it kinda does.

creations-chat 2023-02-02 14:26:47 i am not promoting it. i just want to get alot of downvotes. so in theory, i am noobmoting it or whatever,
creations-chat 2023-02-02 14:28:50 if you hate me, tell me by downvoting my build its the best you can do.
creations-chat 2023-02-03 00:50:42 i dont care + canopy is not finished
creations-chat 2023-02-03 01:51:42 pls
creations-chat 2023-02-04 01:30:17 help

The wings on my f14 were to far away from the idk what they are called but yknow what. so i made it shorter but now it looks goofy (i will send screenshot once my slowchat has expired
creations-chat 2023-02-04 01:32:36 see? now it looks goofy
creations-chat 2023-02-04 01:34:46 SHUT Up. I MADE IT SHORTER TO REMOVE THE SPACE BETWEEN THE WINGS AND THE HIGH PITCH WHATEVER JET STUFF. ITS NOT ABOUT THE SHADER YOURE NOT HELPFUL. GIVE ADVICE ON WHAT I WANT AAND NOT ON STUFF I KNOW YOURE NOT FUNNY NOR DO I NEED YOUR ADVICE On my SHADERS 

and to anwse <@883063424614006878> , im not. im doing it for myself. d id you really think i injected shaders just to send a screenshot? no. i injected them because i like plane crazy better that way.
creations-chat 2023-02-04 01:37:02 A: whatever its called using roshade. i have no idea

to anwser <@523003901075521536>, i know.
creations-chat 2023-02-04 01:39:09 uh is reshade illegal?
creations-chat 2023-02-04 01:41:31 no. i wont. i like it better playing with it on. thats my opinion. no one ever asked for your opinion, nor will a stranger on the internet care about you, your life, or your opinion. you dont matter in my life. i will forget about you in (at best) 2 days. your opinion is as important to me as wether i eat a single ricecorn or not. it does not matter and wont have an impact on my life. shut up
creations-chat 2023-02-04 01:44:00 1st of all: about 7grams a day through my nose
2nd: i dont care. he told me to turn it off.
creations-chat 2023-02-04 01:50:21 nono man. youre better than me in every way imaginable. sure
creations-chat 2023-02-04 01:52:51 first of all: you really think you managed to reach your life goal by bullying an autistic person. omg youre so cool.
creations-chat 2023-02-04 01:55:32 i never did.  i also never said that it was like that. 
<@734608228192616572> well im literally german. anyways bye ima go building with my SHADERS on my SHIT F14 While chatting with my friends in SHIT GRAMMAR

creations-chat 2023-02-06 12:46:10 <#925099219973460008> 
Rule 1: Do not build creations that intentionally cause lag/crash entire servers.

You literally managed to break the First rule in the server and then post publicly about it.
creations-chat 2023-02-06 12:48:43 for me or SLord?
creations-chat 2023-02-06 12:50:51 I mean XXhaker makes sense too but SLord too. i mean xXhaker admitted to it.
creations-chat 2023-02-06 12:53:11 it looks round from all angles.
creations-chat 2023-02-06 13:33:14 i dont get the signs on the front. its ugly and doesnt add to the build. its a goofy ah ah trend among tank builders which sucks. it is fake detail (which is detail thats not actually detail but just makes the build SEEM more complicated, in turn more detailed.). the tank would look 100x better if you removed it. it is extremly ugly this way
creations-chat 2023-02-10 18:14:23 working on a big carrier (avatar to scale)

creations-chat 2023-02-10 18:18:38 thx. its currently 1.5 plots wide.

<@903634635236450394> how does it look goofy?
