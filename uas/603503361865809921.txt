The Tale of burgrbill (603503361865809921)
bug-reports 2022-04-15 14:02:30 okay, so i got a bit of a problem that ruins pretty much every creation i have, for some reason all engines (rocket engines, propellers, wheels, etc.) fade from full blast with no effect to no blast, equal effect, the second i launch. now that's kinda weird, but what's worse is that i can't control them, they just stay off. (motors, pistons, conveyors, etc. still work fine)
bug-reports 2022-04-15 14:06:08 should i bring this into <#478584971670454284> instead?
bug-reports 2022-04-15 14:06:49 bruh it is on
bug-reports 2022-04-15 14:07:03 y u mad
bug-reports 2022-04-15 14:07:17 have you even read the message
bug-reports 2022-04-15 14:09:25 dang, i was so sure it was on, i never usually turn it off, problem solved, thanks angry pal
bug-reports 2022-04-15 14:23:24 i'm sorry, i forgot to turn on infinite fuel again after i've turned it off, thanks anyway though! also, alxti, there's no need to be toxic, it's just a major waste of time
bug-reports 2022-04-15 14:30:44 <#925099219973460008> the number one rule, read it
bug-reports 2022-04-15 14:33:59 i have no right to determine if you've broken the very first rule listed in <#925099219973460008>, but if i were to guess, you have most likely broken it
bug-reports 2022-04-15 14:37:00 thank you!
bug-reports 2022-04-15 15:17:30 calling someone an idiot is not against the rules, no, but their lack of respect and general toxic behaviour is against the <#925099219973460008>. it clearly states it in these two sentences. "You are expected to be respectful to everyone at all times. General toxicity will be met with a ban."
bug-reports 2022-04-15 15:21:47 ah, i'm so dumb sometimes! thanks, i'll do it right away
