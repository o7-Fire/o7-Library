creations-chat 2021-02-19 23:21:07 looks great, idk if you want you could take on the challenge of adding suspension (unless your build already has some in which case great job of concealing it)

creations-chat 2021-02-20 00:28:13 Any feedback on my Su-30 would be greatly appreciated, especially with regards to the rocket systems
creations-chat 2021-02-20 00:32:04 because I can't fit regular landing gear near the body of the plane because of the diameter of the missiles. And I can't fit custom landing gear in the plane because there's nowhere for it to go, sorry for the late response I got put on slow mode.
creations-chat 2021-02-20 00:39:34 lol tysm
creations-chat 2021-02-20 00:42:01 yeah, i think its getting a ton of hate for the right reasons, the missiles are over-sized, the landing gear is a one time use and is trash anyway. But the long range missiles, short range missile and anti shredder air defense system on it are pretty good i think. (Sorry I'm still in slow mode so I'll respond to anything in 2mins)
creations-chat 2021-02-20 00:55:16 well u r certainly the hero in this situation
creations-chat 2021-02-20 04:55:26 What makes people down-vote? I feel like I see a lot of decent builds that get down-voted hard (the world may never know)
creations-chat 2021-03-01 04:20:28 haha ;-;
creations-chat 2021-03-01 04:22:35 sooo... a couple dislikes on my Mig, any feedback?
creations-chat 2021-03-01 04:24:36 Thanks! <@!718006867808485447> and <@!707588709389697064> ! ðŸ˜„
help 2021-03-08 18:18:58 Does anyone have any good small custom mouse aimed missile designs? i keep getting missiles that are 3 blocks wide.
help 2021-03-08 19:56:55 motorlocking is okay i just need it to be under three blocks wide, i keep trying to get something guidable under three but no luck so far (EDIT: sorry for the late reply i was in class)
help 2021-03-08 20:28:13 Me and a friend have been working on small (either 1 or 2 block diameter) guided missiles. 
we are having guidance issues, any help?
help 2021-03-08 22:31:24 Okay Iâ€™ll have one up in 5-10
help 2021-03-08 22:35:07 its says i can't post wmv (roblox screenrecord videos)
help 2021-03-08 22:36:15 ooh okay\
help 2021-03-08 22:37:37 hoping i did this correctly: https://streamable.com/uhid1g
help 2021-03-08 22:38:20 yeah, its just uncontrollable
help 2021-03-08 22:38:38 My goal is to make 1 block in diameter missile
help 2021-03-08 22:39:13 it works well as air to anti-sub but it has no guidance
help 2021-03-08 22:39:23 I'll add more, thanks!
help 2021-03-08 22:45:27 hmmm I added the control surfaces and it works better, but the speed makes it roll way too much (roughly goes 600) but when i decreased its speed it was no longer able to keep strait and kept falling I think adding helium will fix that but its kinda cheating
help 2021-03-08 22:46:00 idk it doesn't seem fair :P*
help 2021-03-08 22:46:38 is it possible that objects in this game can move so fast that they will not begin to fall?
help 2021-03-08 22:46:49 like a terminal velocity?
help 2021-03-08 22:49:50 I don't know i'll keep tinkering away maybe post later in creations if i get anything worthwhile
help 2021-03-08 22:52:15 yeah
help 2021-03-08 22:53:54
