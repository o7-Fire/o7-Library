help 2023-02-22 20:08:57 Yes
help 2023-02-22 21:04:50 It would probably be better if you didnt use a namnam plane, theyre hard to add details to or to make it so the plane actually looks like what you're going for
help 2023-02-22 21:05:57 Namnam planes are just so small so I'd recommend rebuilding the entire thing to make it not a 1 wide plane so you can fit the motor lock tower in without it sticking out
help 2023-02-22 21:06:19 1 wide planes are fine but namnam planes offer little customization from what is given to you in the tutorial
help 2023-02-22 21:07:58 Especially russian planes of that era because they all look so similar so you're basically required to either use a lot of motor lock or make it not namnam style
help 2023-02-22 21:10:16 It can be any scale
help 2023-02-22 21:10:55 Ive seen plenty of su27 but they're all namnam style so if you want to be unique then you should probably not do 1 wide
help 2023-02-22 21:16:16 Isn't su27 a little wide or am i thinking of another plane

help 2023-02-23 11:23:17 I recall 1 block being 1.25 studs
