events-chat 2022-02-05 12:24:09 Yeah because it was so early on nobody has seen it recently, also others did the same
events-chat 2022-02-05 12:35:47 My friend built TheMadVulpen's A-10...
Then I did my best to copy my friend's plane but double the size
events-chat 2022-02-05 12:36:18 Meaning the wing tips look identical
events-chat 2022-02-05 12:37:15 I didn't see the other, and besides YES
events-chat 2022-02-05 12:37:32 Ohhhhh
events-chat 2022-02-05 12:37:56 That really doesn't even look like an A-10
events-chat 2022-02-05 12:39:50 And it was either that or I would have had to do lots of surgery to my Blue Angels F/A-18, F-22, F-35, or MIG-19 to make them slow enough, that was the easiest to slow down
events-chat 2022-02-05 12:40:28 That's a little more A-10ish
events-chat 2022-02-05 12:40:45 Blocks?
events-chat 2022-02-05 12:42:15 I just took about 6-9super rockets out of my fuselage and removed missiles and guns, slight paint job and done
events-chat 2022-02-05 12:42:48 IKR, my normal speed is about 600, and just shy of 1200 blocks
events-chat 2022-02-05 12:43:34 Lol
events-chat 2022-02-05 12:43:56 What is your nerfed and regular speed?
events-chat 2022-02-05 12:44:48 Wow
events-chat 2022-02-05 12:45:20 I need to put hiver engines in mine
events-chat 2022-02-05 12:46:40 Same i only lose ~25 sps to maneuvers
events-chat 2022-02-05 12:47:58 My unnerfed one has 5-6 tnt block bombs that can entirely destroy the plane
events-chat 2022-02-05 12:48:23 Very well, matches any of my fighters, yours?
events-chat 2022-02-05 12:51:58 Well that was a great idea
events-chat 2022-02-05 12:52:20 I hope we get on the same team if we are both chosen, it would be awsome
events-chat 2022-02-05 12:53:05 I am going to work on adding that to my regular one... to late for the event version
events-chat 2022-02-05 12:56:01 Oh ok
events-chat 2022-02-05 12:56:38 Noted... not that mine is really a tut anymore, since it is just copied and expanded
events-chat 2022-02-05 12:57:39 It is not in Plane Crazy
events-chat 2022-02-05 13:43:21 He is right, although very way overboard
events-chat 2022-02-05 13:53:54 I know, it is all gone on the event version
events-chat 2022-02-05 18:45:46 Do you get dm'ed if you are picked?
events-chat 2022-02-05 18:46:05 Oj ok
events-chat 2022-02-05 18:49:34 Yeah go through submissions in <#917397949938548736>  and choose who you want
events-chat 2022-02-05 18:53:35 My big A-10is super maneuverable and can fly with practically no wing, and with only one missle it would be very resilient
events-chat 2022-02-05 18:54:19 Understood
events-chat 2022-02-05 18:55:28 Also few have tracking missles if any making it even more difficult to hit me with more than guns
events-chat 2022-02-05 19:03:06 Yep
events-chat 2022-02-05 19:03:27 What?
events-chat 2022-02-05 19:03:51 Isn't there another modified a-10?
events-chat 2022-02-05 19:04:21 Ok
events-chat 2022-02-05 19:04:37 I thought there was a 3rd
events-chat 2022-02-05 19:08:34 I am in the second event right?
events-chat 2022-02-05 19:10:19 Ok thanks
events-chat 2022-02-05 19:11:08 üòÄüòÑüòÅüòÅ
events-chat 2022-02-05 19:11:30 Our victims will be the other team lol
events-chat 2022-02-05 20:48:04 yep tht's me
events-chat 2022-02-05 20:49:38 the stream will be later
events-chat 2022-02-05 20:50:49 lol
events-chat 2022-02-05 20:51:06 est yes
events-chat 2022-02-05 20:54:10 kk
events-chat 2022-02-06 03:22:39 IT IS AN A-10
events-chat 2022-02-06 03:22:55 Dang right
events-chat 2022-02-06 03:23:34 See about that we shall
events-chat 2022-02-06 03:23:59 BTW what plane has he got
events-chat 2022-02-06 03:24:23 Oh that...
events-chat 2022-02-06 03:24:45 Lol, ZERO match for the triforce A-10s
events-chat 2022-02-06 03:26:32 Remember I have an A-10, Fox aka my team leader has a heavily modified A-10 and our third team member has a realistic A-10
events-chat 2022-02-06 03:26:48 Yes I have
events-chat 2022-02-06 03:27:08 And you haven't seen mine...
events-chat 2022-02-06 03:29:22 But remember defeating gjsolo is not the priority, only avoiding him
events-chat 2022-02-06 03:40:05 I think it will be useful
events-chat 2022-02-06 03:47:01 Seconded
events-chat 2022-02-06 04:03:46 Where is the stream
events-chat 2022-02-06 04:05:05 Heart job mate
events-chat 2022-02-06 13:06:32 As for my team, TailedFoxNine (modified A-10 with F-16 style wings) (teamleader),  SavageKing7733 (regular A-10), and myself (super-sized A-10)
events-chat 2022-02-06 13:56:14 Which team is gjsolo on?
events-chat 2022-02-06 13:57:39 If he is on aftershock's team box would make it unbalanced
events-chat 2022-02-06 13:59:27 Yes
events-chat 2022-02-06 14:02:33 Yes
events-chat 2022-02-06 14:27:50 I think make them choose between Gjsolo and Box, then their teams fight in round one
events-chat 2022-02-06 14:49:11 Aight so whatever team box ends up on needs to fight Aftershock52's team in round one
events-chat 2022-02-06 16:47:43 That's me
events-chat 2022-02-06 16:51:43 Yep
events-chat 2022-02-06 20:18:39 My teammates didn't follow THEIR OWN PLAN
events-chat 2022-02-06 21:57:49 Well of course gjsolo won
events-chat 2022-02-06 22:02:16 I never got to fight him
events-chat 2022-02-06 22:04:46 With practice i think it could be very effective, just not on the first try
events-chat 2022-02-06 22:05:30 We should work on that together
events-chat 2022-02-06 22:06:27 I think next time it should be a minimum of 2v1 against gjsolo
events-chat 2022-02-06 22:07:10 Lol
events-chat 2022-02-06 22:08:00 Question, what is the difference in close tracking and legacy?
events-chat 2022-02-06 22:08:32 An impossible against you
events-chat 2022-02-06 22:09:38 What happened to old missile lock? Where they could lock from like 3 times the distance as now
events-chat 2022-02-06 22:10:07 Ohhhh ok
events-chat 2022-02-06 22:10:23 GJSOLO GETS NO WINGMAN
events-chat 2022-02-06 22:11:55 There is one way to boost missile damage
events-chat 2022-02-06 22:12:26 Nope
events-chat 2022-02-06 22:12:50 Very difficult to add to a plane tho
events-chat 2022-02-06 22:17:56 Oooo
events-chat 2022-02-06 22:18:13 YES
events-chat 2022-02-06 22:20:05 ... that is nothing
events-chat 2022-02-06 22:20:44 Wait till I complete my 2000+ sps tank
events-chat 2022-02-06 22:21:17 So, that isn't the point
events-chat 2022-02-06 22:22:42 Ok what is your RB user i will join you
events-chat 2022-02-06 22:24:02 That is a "tank" boat not a tank "tank"
events-chat 2022-02-06 22:24:44 It is a TANKY BOAT
events-chat 2022-02-06 22:25:22 You got a private i can join
events-chat 2022-02-06 22:25:41 My tank may not be ready i sure sure am
events-chat 2022-02-06 22:26:27 Dude LET'S ONE V ONE
events-chat 2022-02-06 22:30:14 Hehe <@456226577798135808>  has chickened out of our 1v1
events-chat 2022-02-06 22:34:22 <@456226577798135808> FIGHT ME
events-chat 2022-02-06 22:34:48 Fine
events-chat 2022-02-06 22:35:15 SHREK
events-chat 2022-02-06 22:36:14 Ok, well let's do it
events-chat 2022-02-06 22:36:40 You got a private server?
events-chat 2022-02-06 22:37:17 You are just chicken
events-chat 2022-02-06 22:38:27 <@456226577798135808>  NOW FIGHT ME OR SUFFER THE CONSEQUENCES
events-chat 2022-02-06 22:39:35 Out of time
events-chat 2022-02-07 12:49:34 FOR SURE
events-chat 2022-02-07 12:50:53 <@335599526414909451>, you should make a poll in <#621452102618578964> for banning gjsolo from future events lol
events-chat 2022-02-07 12:53:44 <@335599526414909451>, you should make a poll in <#621452102618578964> for banning gjsolo from future events lol, or maybe rather than banning him, just make sure he ALWAYS counts for two people, that would be a little more balanced
events-chat 2022-02-07 12:54:16 True
events-chat 2022-02-08 02:04:53 Yes I DID
events-chat 2022-02-08 02:13:19 ... why
events-chat 2022-02-08 02:13:40 ...
events-chat 2022-02-08 02:13:56 One v one me sometime
events-chat 2022-02-08 02:14:12 Yeah I need to fix that
events-chat 2022-02-08 02:14:44 How the heck do I still have the content role
events-chat 2022-02-08 02:15:00 I need to switch the legacy glass
events-chat 2022-02-08 02:15:40 That is not the best pic
events-chat 2022-02-08 02:15:57 I took that just to show the "drones"
events-chat 2022-02-08 02:16:21 Find the earlier pic, it is a but better
events-chat 2022-02-08 02:16:43 He meand the video, they aren't there yet idt
events-chat 2022-02-08 02:18:13 Yes there is
events-chat 2022-02-08 02:19:48 Weird it is gone now
events-chat 2022-02-08 02:23:39 just you wait...
events-chat 2022-02-08 02:24:19 Or another A-10
events-chat 2022-02-08 02:26:00 My A-10 has all the guns, missiles, and fireworks
events-chat 2022-02-08 02:26:28 But a box won't fly
events-chat 2022-02-08 02:26:45 Yes EXACTLY thankyou
events-chat 2022-02-08 02:27:56 Ok, at the time I made that is was meant to DEMOLISH my friend's A-10 that he had painted with the French Flag colors, which it did VERY well
events-chat 2022-02-08 02:28:44 The team color painting makes it look even worse
events-chat 2022-02-08 02:29:02 I never did lol
events-chat 2022-02-08 02:30:48 Did the hof post have the speed? Or block count
events-chat 2022-02-08 02:31:22 Ok, I didn't know
events-chat 2022-02-08 02:32:09 He knows
events-chat 2022-02-08 02:33:34 Ehh even when mine is over double most A-10 block counts, and atleast 50% faster lol
events-chat 2022-02-08 02:33:51 I agree
events-chat 2022-02-08 02:34:08 Right about 1200
events-chat 2022-02-08 02:34:31 But not controllable for pvp tho
events-chat 2022-02-08 02:34:58 For my first over 400 build it was
events-chat 2022-02-08 02:53:31 ...
events-chat 2022-02-08 02:55:19 ...
...
...
events-chat 2022-02-08 02:57:50 It doesn't belong here, it belongs in <#384025409945337856>  lol
events-chat 2022-02-08 19:55:55 YES PLEASE or atleast 50
events-chat 2022-02-08 21:11:40 There are other 50-100 player games on RB
events-chat 2022-02-08 21:36:42 if only I could use this in the event... it is more blocks to get here than all 3 planes COMBINED
events-chat 2022-02-08 23:59:06 Doof only ever had guns due to speed advantage
events-chat 2022-02-09 00:04:52 For YOUR enjoyment
events-chat 2022-02-09 00:05:24 üòÄ
events-chat 2022-02-09 00:05:48 Lol that was for 5
events-chat 2022-02-09 00:10:53 Ok, I forgot then, but I assume it got nerfed due to speed and addition of the bomber
events-chat 2022-02-09 00:15:36 The listing says P-76 OBC
However I do not know which it is meant to be... I highly suspect it will be removed
events-chat 2022-02-09 00:15:58 Anyone know if teams are being chosen?
events-chat 2022-02-09 00:20:43 Atleast the planes are WAY more balanced than the last event, where gjsolo's plane just owned anyone and anything
events-chat 2022-02-09 00:22:21 As for the prep I agree 100%
Although as for the actual event skill will take over BIG TIME
bot-central 2022-02-09 00:24:33 !rank
events-chat 2022-02-09 01:08:29 Wow
events-chat 2022-02-09 01:10:39 What do y'all think of my submission?
events-chat 2022-02-09 01:11:16 Just like you
events-chat 2022-02-09 01:11:48 Uno reverse card
events-chat 2022-02-09 01:14:36 TINCAN
events-chat 2022-02-09 01:47:08 Yep, they said there would be tut vids but they never made/posted them
events-chat 2022-02-09 01:47:35 ??
events-chat 2022-02-09 01:48:03 Where
events-chat 2022-02-09 01:48:19 That's what I did
events-chat 2022-02-09 01:48:35 Ohhhh
events-chat 2022-02-09 01:55:02 Nice one mate, sadly I do feel like you may have done too much modification,  best looking Tincan for sure though
events-chat 2022-02-09 01:56:47 Remove canopy completely
events-chat 2022-02-09 01:57:33 And remove the turret barrels
events-chat 2022-02-09 02:12:40 It is exactly what it says it is
events-chat 2022-02-09 02:15:35 How are you getting the guns on the fireworks????
events-chat 2022-02-09 02:16:29 They fall off for me when I spawn in lol and I do not know why
events-chat 2022-02-09 02:17:16 I am on mobile, do you see any issues with my grammar??
events-chat 2022-02-09 02:17:33 As in text signs?
events-chat 2022-02-09 02:17:54 To what block tho
events-chat 2022-02-09 02:18:10 Ohhhhhhhh ok
events-chat 2022-02-09 02:18:46 Ohhh my, of course
events-chat 2022-02-09 02:19:58 Wat
events-chat 2022-02-09 02:22:07 
events-chat 2022-02-09 02:22:22 It is if you go back to airport
events-chat 2022-02-09 02:22:56 Even if shot down?
events-chat 2022-02-09 02:23:26 Ok
events-chat 2022-02-09 02:25:16 Mostly copy, you can modify aesthetics
events-chat 2022-02-09 02:25:51 Illegal
events-chat 2022-02-09 02:27:21 
events-chat 2022-02-09 02:27:56 What about that?
events-chat 2022-02-09 02:28:41 Exactly, that is how we know his plane has the bigger prop engine
events-chat 2022-02-09 02:31:43 I am talking about someone's in the submission P-76
events-chat 2022-02-09 02:44:01 Ok so when you get shot down you are out?
events-chat 2022-02-09 02:54:22 Ok I thought so but some people were questioning that
events-chat 2022-02-09 02:55:57 Only if you make it to airport
events-chat 2022-02-09 03:03:42 Would have to paint solid red, green, yellow; or something like that to show others "Out of Combat"
events-chat 2022-02-09 03:05:20 Lol
events-chat 2022-02-09 03:05:50 There you go
events-chat 2022-02-09 03:16:29 Try removing 2
events-chat 2022-02-09 03:17:19 Yeah
events-chat 2022-02-09 03:17:47 My plane went a bit faster than supposed at first as well, but I figured out how to slow it down
events-chat 2022-02-09 03:20:36 But it makes it legal speed tho
events-chat 2022-02-09 03:21:16 Just say you had to remove them to make it correct speed, rules just say you can't ADD more engines, nothing about removing rhem
events-chat 2022-02-09 03:22:02 Event is Saturday, nobody wants to wait, we want time to practice with planes
events-chat 2022-02-09 03:23:08 I made mine wasd with the regular control surfaces lol
events-chat 2022-02-09 03:25:09 Have you seen mine tho?
events-chat 2022-02-09 03:26:44 ...
events-chat 2022-02-09 03:27:33 NOT LEGAL
events-chat 2022-02-09 03:30:15 Gl getting accepted with that
events-chat 2022-02-09 03:30:30 Block count?
events-chat 2022-02-09 03:33:08 üòâ
events-chat 2022-02-09 03:37:47 Wow GG
events-chat 2022-02-09 03:39:07 True, however with the bombs all you have to do is get back the the airport and you can respawn... aka fresh undamaged plane, also with bombs dropped you will go faster
events-chat 2022-02-09 03:40:21 Fun fact: someone wants me to make this: B-17 bomber fuselage, f-35 engine, and cessna 172 wings trollface
events-chat 2022-02-09 03:40:58 4TNT set to max is more powerful than 4 rockets tho
events-chat 2022-02-09 03:41:36 True
events-chat 2022-02-09 03:42:31 High above??
events-chat 2022-02-09 03:43:06 Defenders, even other attackers could end up getting hit, not the carrier either way
events-chat 2022-02-09 03:43:24 Gonna have to be close to it
events-chat 2022-02-09 03:44:05 I have had planes unknowingly fly into the path of non-tracking missiles
events-chat 2022-02-09 03:44:48 True
events-chat 2022-02-09 03:48:10 Rules never said not to use camera locking...
events-chat 2022-02-09 03:49:09 But, it works when motor locking is banned...
events-chat 2022-02-09 03:49:25 Nice choice
events-chat 2022-02-09 03:50:06 You get turret + whichever loadout you choose tho
events-chat 2022-02-09 03:52:27 Aight well, good night all...
Because unlike most (if not all) of you I have an office job I have to get up for tomorrow, since I have no school and Wednesdays
events-chat 2022-02-10 03:09:04 Almost, NO ROCKETS lol
events-chat 2022-02-10 03:13:41 Cause other wise bomber too OP
events-chat 2022-02-10 03:14:09 EXACTLY, aka it was over powered
events-chat 2022-02-10 03:24:03 Not really
events-chat 2022-02-10 03:24:30 Just get good
events-chat 2022-02-10 16:43:20 1.2 k blocks get it right
events-chat 2022-02-10 20:35:37 right...

events-chat 2022-02-11 01:24:07 Is there any point to the gun on the yousef? To me there isn't
events-chat 2022-02-11 01:25:52 ONE GUN????? Onr other attacker would as defense for a bomber would be WAY better tho
events-chat 2022-02-11 01:27:46 Has anyone else built all 4 event planes?
events-chat 2022-02-11 01:30:59 Ahh ok
events-chat 2022-02-11 01:31:25 Was that pic spawned in since 2 planes are infront of build area?
events-chat 2022-02-11 01:31:52 But they have different paint schemes mine are the same

events-chat 2022-02-11 01:39:00 Did you use anchor blocks to hold the unused planes stationary?
events-chat 2022-02-11 01:59:31 Ohh ok
events-chat 2022-02-11 02:00:02 Soo for the event how are you going to keep from all 4 flying near by
events-chat 2022-02-11 02:06:10 Not yet
events-chat 2022-02-11 02:13:44 It is not that hard, I built all 4 in about 20-30 minutes
events-chat 2022-02-11 02:14:59 Later i can't get on rb rn sorry

events-chat 2022-02-11 03:11:38 Sorry but others said that Monday, I won't believe it till I see them
events-chat 2022-02-11 03:16:21 He is correct though...

events-chat 2022-02-11 03:25:48 Ehh only if you submit it, you could still build one right and submit that
events-chat 2022-02-11 03:26:08 No missiles or fireworks tho
events-chat 2022-02-11 03:27:02 Not the worst thing I have seen in PC
events-chat 2022-02-11 03:27:34 I know, but you didn't combine the armaments from the 3
events-chat 2022-02-11 03:28:05 PLEASE DO
events-chat 2022-02-11 03:28:22 Nice job that is a difficult achievement
events-chat 2022-02-11 03:41:40 Those are small engines, and as for changing the prop locations they don't care
events-chat 2022-02-11 03:44:51 No, you can move them to front of the wings
events-chat 2022-02-11 23:15:11 For it's speed it is great
