plane-crazy 2020-03-18 06:29:47 how fast is it doe?
plane-crazy 2020-03-11 02:37:28 (from personal experience)
plane-crazy 2020-03-11 02:37:11 It would have to be manually controlled because Motor 2's don't like regular motors
plane-crazy 2020-03-11 02:12:30 oh
plane-crazy 2020-03-11 02:08:21 They can be good, it just depends on how the ship is built
plane-crazy 2020-03-11 02:06:16 how is that suppose to help?
plane-crazy 2020-03-11 02:05:25 okay
plane-crazy 2020-03-11 02:04:31 plus you're a huge target and everyone is going to shoot at you regardless
