i ainâ€™t doing shit with the crappy plane crazy system


I know the hull is short, I know the stack is wrong, and color sucks in plane crazy
creations-chat 2022-11-14 15:33:15 Iâ€™m actually a veteran builder so you suck.


no. This is my first ship, it was not built for show, it was built because I was bored and the anniversary of the sinking was coming up
creations-chat 2022-11-14 15:37:51 i Said no ðŸ’€
creations-chat 2022-11-14 15:40:41 yeah I actually am a veteran builder I served 5 years in the space force
creations-chat 2022-11-14 15:42:44 so you think I was saying in a veteran builder? no tf Iâ€™m not lol


yeah Iâ€™m to lazy to tinker with the ship for now, I have more important things like my addiction to war thunder
creations-chat 2022-11-14 15:47:26 it was a joke bruh but those are pretty hard to make fr fr
creations-chat 2022-11-14 15:49:39 Miata god please no
creations-chat 2022-11-14 15:54:08 mr sir bubbington i will remember this in the next few months when I might probably donâ€™t play plane crazy
creations-chat 2022-11-14 16:02:43 <@903304798563074099> the nose looks a little long on the Phantom, and the cockpit wasnâ€™t separate as it is, the back of the cockpit didnâ€™t angle down it met with the fuselage 

Other wise itâ€™s very nice
creations-chat 2022-11-14 16:23:36 weâ€™ve figured that out
