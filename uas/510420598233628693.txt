bug-reports 2022-04-15 14:10:40 There is a bug with the jetpack. I haven't really figured out why it happens but it sometimes starts to go up even tho I don't want it. All tho there is a way how to fix it - just equip the jetpack and close the builder menu (Hammer button) And unequip and then equip again and it should work. But I think this should get fixed if it's possible, have a good day and easter ðŸ™‚
