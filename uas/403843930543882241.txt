bot-central 2020-08-11 13:39:37 Wait wat
bot-central 2020-08-11 13:39:49 Eh whatever
bug-reports 2020-08-11 15:44:21 This has been a issue for me at least for quite a while.
While using motor 2s and not being on servo mode, the motor will point 90 degrees to the left oh the mouse cursor which is annoying cause I can‚Äôt aim.

A lava lake issue.
So the lava lake is a nice edition to the map but it is causing problems in its wake too. People who made lag machines don‚Äôt even use them anymore. They make a big vehicle and drive into the lake causing major lag. We won‚Äôt be able to report their names because he have already died.
I‚Äôm not asking for the removal of the lava lake Im just asking for a way to make the lava lake less laggy. I don‚Äôt think this is a bug but it should be told

bug-reports 2020-08-19 13:24:55 maybe it got pushed
bug-reports 2020-08-19 13:26:42 it could be smaller in design maybe thats why it doesnt stick
bug-reports 2020-08-22 06:47:15 There is no speed limit there is a speed barrier which you can easily break
bug-reports 2020-08-22 06:48:09 It‚Äôs like the blacklist box in a nutshell
bug-reports 2020-08-23 23:04:11 That has already been a issue fluff but you can fix it by adding blocks behind the wheel to stop the motor from bending which will probably resolve your flying issue
creations-chat 2020-08-25 00:54:53 Why is it so tall

bug-reports 2020-08-27 23:08:30 Somehow explosives set to impact doesn‚Äôt explode even when launched at high speed
bug-reports 2020-08-27 23:10:27 Even at speed 1 it fails to detonate even with a help from me
bug-reports 2020-08-27 23:11:47 By launching it using a rail gun at a speed of709

creations-chat 2020-08-28 06:48:32 By the looks of it
creations-chat 2020-08-28 06:49:16 I don‚Äôt think the game can handle flying aircraft carriers

creations-chat 2020-08-28 06:53:06 He saved
creations-chat 2020-08-28 06:53:19 I assume before he left it already had missing blocks
creations-chat 2020-08-28 06:53:59 Can you rejoin again
creations-chat 2020-08-28 06:54:48 I think he took the word ‚Äúrejoin‚Äù wrong
bug-reports 2020-08-28 06:55:47 It could be lag
creations-chat 2020-08-28 06:56:39 Did he save the carrier when it had missing blocks
creations-chat 2020-08-28 06:56:55 Nice
creations-chat 2020-08-28 06:57:42 Could it be possible that he left before it could even finish Saving :/

creations-chat 2020-08-28 07:00:35 Fill in blocks where it was suppose to be
creations-chat 2020-08-28 07:01:24 But if it gets corrupted again I suggest you to save the carrier in another file
creations-chat 2020-08-28 07:01:38 Before it disappears into the void
creations-chat 2020-08-28 07:01:49 Tell me how I know
creations-chat 2020-08-28 07:03:16 I let my friend borrow my thumb drive and it got corrupted because his computer had a corruption error

bug-reports 2020-08-29 14:14:48 The explosive bug has been a known issue every since the roblox update
bug-reports 2020-08-29 14:15:12 Until rick can fix it, it will be bugged for now
bug-reports 2020-08-29 14:15:27 So don‚Äôt use impact
bug-reports 2020-08-29 14:15:31 You can‚Äôt
bug-reports 2020-08-29 14:15:34 It‚Äôs a bug
bug-reports 2020-08-29 14:16:06 It will work sometimes
bug-reports 2020-08-29 14:16:14 But don‚Äôt expect it to work constantly

bug-reports 2020-08-29 14:18:35 Mine just explodes before launch lol
bug-reports 2020-08-29 16:13:01 Trapdoors are broken for the time being
bug-reports 2020-08-29 16:16:18 Things that are broken:
-Explosive blocks when set to explode on impact
-trapdoors not being to open both on the clients side and the other player
bug-reports 2020-08-30 07:08:17 When in a private server hit registration fails to detect when pvp is on
bug-reports 2020-08-30 14:43:29 New bugs
-Some blocks being completely immune to rockets in some pvp servers and private servers so that would mean by some chance shredder bugs will become unkillable to a certain extant
-explosive blocks and explosive balls can‚Äôt explode on impact since the new roblox update
-some build being corrupted on other people‚Äôs builds not mine
-trapdoors can‚Äôt be opened on both the other players side and the clients side even when using the keybind to open
-rockets and fireworks will not damage or destroy a target if your moving (which sucks)
bug-reports 2020-08-30 14:54:30 And idk if this is a bug but the game is requiring more GPU to render the map and the blocks in fact sometimes I sink into the ground cause my map wasn‚Äôt rendered fast enough

bug-reports 2020-08-30 23:12:53 <@!217336009455566848> here are the lists of new bugs if you were wondering.

New bugs

-explosive blocks and explosive balls can‚Äôt explode on impact since the new roblox update
-some build being corrupted on other people‚Äôs builds not mine

-rockets and fireworks will not damage or destroy a target if your moving (which sucks)
bug-reports 2020-08-30 23:14:07 I have tested this multiple times and it only works sometimes
bug-reports 2020-08-30 23:16:52 And idk if this is a bug but the game is requiring more GPU to render the map and the blocks in fact sometimes I sink into the ground cause my map wasn‚Äôt rendered fast enough
bug-reports 2020-08-31 00:27:15 Simple
bug-reports 2020-08-31 00:27:35 Stretch the piston till it‚Äôs no more
bug-reports 2020-08-31 00:27:44 How far it can stretch? Idk
bug-reports 2020-08-31 00:28:10 My lock piston made me a Unrequested ejection seat for my yak 9
bug-reports 2020-08-31 07:55:37 So this is a warning
bug-reports 2020-08-31 07:55:47 Do not be me
bug-reports 2020-08-31 07:56:04 It crashes my roblox client cause it broke the rope
bug-reports 2020-08-31 07:56:33 But putting the motor to lock isn‚Äôt lethal
bug-reports 2020-08-31 07:56:35 Yet
bug-reports 2020-08-31 07:56:48 It just makes the motor sink into the piston
bug-reports 2020-08-31 12:01:37 Yeah it‚Äôs a big since the new roblox update
bug-reports 2020-08-31 12:08:10 So a update on the rope breaking thing
bug-reports 2020-08-31 12:08:28 So the rope isn‚Äôt the one that crashes your client
bug-reports 2020-08-31 12:09:20 It‚Äôs a barrier that once touched crashes your client
bug-reports 2020-08-31 12:09:42 Idk where is the barrier exactly because I was traveling pretty fast to even know where it was
bug-reports 2020-08-31 12:10:40 Also
bug-reports 2020-08-31 12:11:11 If your thinking about using the game breaking contraption as a cannon, don‚Äôt do it I tried but it dint work
bug-reports 2020-08-31 12:11:43 But if you use locked pistons correctly it does actually help
bug-reports 2020-09-01 04:19:48 Idk of it‚Äôs a bug or not but it is a thing
bug-reports 2020-09-01 04:20:24 The the pilot seat is being held up by 1 block, and someone shoots that 1 block, the person will only see a flying chair
bug-reports 2020-09-01 04:20:45 Which to be honest is very terrorific
bug-reports 2020-09-01 14:37:23 <@!479298992874979328> using only 1 motor will make it extremely unstable
bug-reports 2020-09-01 14:37:30 It‚Äôs not a bug
bug-reports 2020-09-01 14:37:36 It‚Äôs just a flaw in your design
bug-reports 2020-09-01 14:38:21 But if it doesn‚Äôt work your last option would be to lower your motor speed
bug-reports 2020-09-01 14:40:22 Or, add a very very very heavy ballest at the bottom of in between the 2 motors
bug-reports 2020-09-01 14:40:32 Which won‚Äôt look good
bug-reports 2020-09-01 14:45:29 That gives me a idea
bug-reports 2020-09-01 14:46:03 Has anyone suggested for the PVP servers to have random seeds?
bug-reports 2020-09-01 14:46:42 I can‚Äôt suggest because I don‚Äôt have a rank ;-;
bug-reports 2020-09-02 10:24:00 I have a issue
bug-reports 2020-09-02 10:30:14 A block is stuck underneath the plot area.
This would make it not being able to get deleted or edited.
bug-reports 2020-09-02 10:31:57 It‚Äôs under the map tho
bug-reports 2020-09-02 10:32:16 Hmm

bug-reports 2020-09-02 15:33:22 You sure someone didn‚Äôt lock the VIP server?
bug-reports 2020-09-02 23:18:33 I think it‚Äôs a gyroscopic precession issue
bug-reports 2020-09-02 23:19:07 What did you load?
bug-reports 2020-09-02 23:19:40 Was there anyone near you that could have had a server crasher
bug-reports 2020-09-02 23:19:51 Hm
bug-reports 2020-09-02 23:20:09 Well
bug-reports 2020-09-02 23:20:18 Rick will have to sort this
bug-reports 2020-09-03 00:10:57 Corruption
bug-reports 2020-09-03 15:53:14 It could be lag
bug-reports 2020-09-03 15:53:24 Lag is pretty unpredictable
bug-reports 2020-09-03 15:53:37 And some servers may not be updated
bug-reports 2020-09-03 15:53:48 But that will have to be confirmed by rick
bug-reports 2020-09-03 15:54:24 Oh come on not now
bug-reports 2020-09-03 16:04:48 Well you know the drill when roblox is being roblox
bug-reports 2020-09-04 06:12:06 It happens
bug-reports 2020-09-04 06:12:10 It‚Äôs a easy fix
bug-reports 2020-09-05 08:28:27 I have the same issue but mine is effecting slots not random
bug-reports 2020-09-05 08:44:32 Mine is my motors not following the cursor correctly
bug-reports 2020-09-06 16:03:39 I wouldn‚Äôt recommend having to push your computer to its limits, like making a 20000 block ship but you know you computer is struggling to even move it.
bug-reports 2020-09-06 16:04:06 That can lead to save files not saving properly use to lag and all that stuff
bug-reports 2020-09-06 16:04:45 It‚Äôs either the computer isn‚Äôt powerful enough or the new slots are all corrupted in some way
bug-reports 2020-09-06 16:10:49 Also a new bug has been found. In some cases blacklisting barriers will appear after someone unblacklists people but you can still go through the blacklist barrier. This will affect conveyors as they literally climb the blacklist barrier
bug-reports 2020-09-06 16:12:34 On the topic of conveyors, it‚Äôs broken. Conveyor tanks will be immobilised if it goes onto someone else‚Äôs build, going onto the airports runway and taxiway and going onto the docks.
bug-reports 2020-09-06 16:12:58 It‚Äôs like the conveyors don‚Äôt even exist if you cross any of the surfaces mentioned
bug-reports 2020-09-06 16:13:28 <@!217336009455566848> please fix the things mentioned above
bug-reports 2020-09-06 16:16:34 Oh great
bug-reports 2020-09-06 16:16:44 Why not
bug-reports 2020-09-06 16:16:52 Countless people have done so
bug-reports 2020-09-06 16:17:05 No because I follow the majority
bug-reports 2020-09-06 16:17:25 But it is a issue that needs to be addressed
bug-reports 2020-09-06 16:18:02 .-.
bug-reports 2020-09-06 16:18:33 <@!508745517753434138> try whatever you can to try to fix the issue
bug-reports 2020-09-06 16:19:24 If you want you can try setting the day night cycle to night then rejoin
bug-reports 2020-09-06 16:20:00 Wat.
bug-reports 2020-09-06 16:20:10 I think it could be lag
bug-reports 2020-09-06 16:21:27 Does this server allow alts?
bug-reports 2020-09-06 16:21:47 Bruh I dint ping rick for that
bug-reports 2020-09-06 16:22:19 > On the topic of conveyors, it‚Äôs broken. Conveyor tanks will be immobilised if it goes onto someone else‚Äôs build, going onto the airports runway and taxiway and going onto the docks.

bug-reports 2020-09-06 16:22:30 Not about day night cycle
bug-reports 2020-09-06 16:22:46 It‚Äôs a conveyor
bug-reports 2020-09-06 16:23:00 Wat.
bug-reports 2020-09-06 16:23:21 It‚Äôs already at max!
bug-reports 2020-09-06 16:24:15 I dint see how making a mini mark V with tank treads would help
bug-reports 2020-09-06 16:24:55 This is why I hate using this phone
bug-reports 2020-09-06 16:25:33 Because my father used it so it has auto saved military stuff
bug-reports 2020-09-06 16:25:49 Send help
bug-reports 2020-09-06 16:26:07 Wtf
bug-reports 2020-09-06 16:26:47 I am about to jump off a 15 story building for what I had just gone through

bug-reports 2020-09-06 16:33:18 It‚Äôs all loading failures?
bug-reports 2020-09-06 16:33:47 So even the sky failed
bug-reports 2020-09-06 16:34:12 Gods work
bug-reports 2020-09-06 16:34:22 You can‚Äôt do anything
bug-reports 2020-09-06 16:35:21 Wait
bug-reports 2020-09-06 16:35:24 What?
bug-reports 2020-09-06 16:36:19 Congrats
help 2020-09-06 16:39:41 I‚Äôm not a mech guy sorry
help 2020-09-06 16:40:34 Physics throttle?
help 2020-09-06 16:45:24 But who would use motor 2s to move :/
help 2020-09-06 16:46:12 Oh yeah that‚Äôs true
help 2020-09-06 16:46:41 Nah
help 2020-09-06 16:47:02 My motor 2s don‚Äôt even work because their slotcist
help 2020-09-06 16:48:14 On some slots like the save slot I have my Mark V in, the motor 2s work perfectly but on the slot where I save my mini boat with a turret in TOP it just doesn‚Äôt want to follow the cursor
help 2020-09-06 16:49:14 In bug Reports?
help 2020-09-06 16:49:33 Is there a way to fix it cause it‚Äôs getting really annoying
help 2020-09-06 16:50:30 I‚Äôm not sure about that actually
help 2020-09-06 16:50:41 In other games it works fine
help 2020-09-06 16:51:05 But it only affects plane crazy specifically
help 2020-09-06 16:52:28 I think it is the code
help 2020-09-06 16:52:46 Control surfaces work fine on automatic
help 2020-09-06 16:53:28 I don‚Äôt know about that
help 2020-09-06 16:53:37 It has been 3 years
help 2020-09-06 16:53:58 And I am still facing the same issue 3 years later
help 2020-09-06 16:54:55 It‚Äôs time to use the way back machine
bug-reports 2020-09-06 17:00:47 Fix the cursor tracker for motor 2s
bug-reports 2020-09-06 17:01:06 It works for some slots but doesn‚Äôt work on others
the-dump 2020-09-06 17:06:36 About the animal abuse thing, that‚Äôs fine with peta
the-dump 2020-09-06 17:06:57 What‚Äôs not fine with peta is Obama swatting a fly.
bug-reports 2020-09-08 07:04:38 Please don‚Äôt rely on the new save files to store big builds it can get corrupted in some occasions. You will have to rely on your older slots to store bigger builds. The new save files should only be able to save small builds for the time being.
bug-reports 2020-09-08 07:08:37 And also motor 2s are pretty poweful. They try to go back to the original state if it has been altered or moved unlike motor 1s which just stays.
help 2020-09-08 07:19:31 There is no real way to increase the physics throttle. Adding rockets will not increase the physics throttle either as the physics throttle will just decrease to keep you on that constant speed.
help 2020-09-08 07:20:13 The only ways to beat physics throttle is to have a high powered computer or live with it
help 2020-09-08 07:21:11 However adding rockets may make people fling out of the map due to physics
help 2020-09-08 07:21:27 Even though your travelling at a constant speed
help 2020-09-08 07:21:56 So did it work or no
help 2020-09-08 07:23:12 Eh
bug-reports 2020-09-09 01:37:15 The entire yatch became the hitbox
bug-reports 2020-09-09 01:37:41 Imagine getting shot by a bullet
bug-reports 2020-09-09 01:37:57 If it‚Äôs the engine then where‚Äôs the stern
bug-reports 2020-09-09 01:38:16 Where‚Äôs the back of the yatch?
bug-reports 2020-09-09 01:38:54 His yatch merged with the engine
bug-reports 2020-09-09 01:39:13 <:what:644996672048463942>
bug-reports 2020-09-09 01:39:36 That‚Äôs why I said the yatch mergers with the engine!
bug-reports 2020-09-09 01:39:53 It merged together with the engine to create that useless hitbox!
bug-reports 2020-09-09 14:14:04 I found a bug
bug-reports 2020-09-09 14:14:12 
bug-reports 2020-09-09 14:14:31 Idk if someone found this already or not but I‚Äôll leave it here
bug-reports 2020-09-09 16:05:07 It‚Äôs not the anchor block
bug-reports 2020-09-09 16:05:18 I tested it several times
bug-reports 2020-09-09 16:05:35 Somebody blacklisted me before he left
bug-reports 2020-09-09 16:05:44 But the barrier still exists but just colourless
bug-reports 2020-09-09 16:05:58 I tested it another server and it had the same issue
bug-reports 2020-09-09 16:06:12 But it‚Äôs just that it went away for awhile
bug-reports 2020-09-09 16:08:04 And also <@!419477639229865984> if I used a anchor block with a suspension you would see it because my car has no space.
bug-reports 2020-09-09 16:13:22 But if you need more proof go into a random server ask someone to blacklist you can tell him to leave. It may work but that‚Äôs depending
bug-reports 2020-09-10 04:36:46 The graphics is bugged completely at high altitude you can see the airport clearly but the airport disappears if you try to land on it
bug-reports 2020-09-10 09:54:25 Before the update I could render the world properly
bug-reports 2020-09-12 17:31:53 Reset or relaunch
bug-reports 2020-09-12 17:33:04 So I found out that the graphics rendering issue isn‚Äôt just me it seems to happen to most of us and only in plane crazy
bug-reports 2020-09-12 17:33:33 I think the best desktops are even struggling to render
bug-reports 2020-09-12 17:35:09 Also have I can‚Äôt make my wing panel glass. It registers when I press it but doesn‚Äôt become glass
bug-reports 2020-09-12 17:35:31 No errors 6 warnings
bug-reports 2020-09-13 02:52:08 Pistons are cool they act as shock absorbers most of the time too
bug-reports 2020-09-13 15:14:29 So about the airplane  having a lot of missing blocks, that isn‚Äôt a bug. It‚Äôs the process of the player leaving and the blocks disappearing / deleting. It takes awhile for the process to be completed.
bug-reports 2020-09-13 15:15:08 Especially with big builds
bug-reports 2020-09-13 23:07:21 Yeah I should warn you that if you fly in another camera mode and jump off your seat the camera won‚Äôt go to your player model, instead it will remain of the camera that you are using until you sit back into the main pilot seat.
bug-reports 2020-09-13 23:07:39 And <@456226577798135808> it‚Äôs not a bug
bug-reports 2020-09-13 23:08:03 It‚Äôs not!
bug-reports 2020-09-13 23:08:09 It‚Äôs the process of someone leaving
bug-reports 2020-09-13 23:08:22 Just that the process takes awhile to complete
bug-reports 2020-09-13 23:08:43 Bruh no on owns the plot
bug-reports 2020-09-13 23:08:48 Dint you see?
bug-reports 2020-09-13 23:09:30 No one own the plot!!!
bug-reports 2020-09-13 23:09:40 So that would mean that person already left!!
bug-reports 2020-09-13 23:10:04 Yeah but that isn‚Äôt the same thing
bug-reports 2020-09-13 23:11:47 Go into VIP 1 and wait for someone to leave. The player will leave first but their creation will be slowly deleted by the game.
creations-chat 2020-09-15 15:01:36 This is what quarantine is telling me:
creations-chat 2020-09-15 15:01:39 Please send help
creations-chat 2020-09-15 15:02:32 Ah
creations-chat 2020-09-15 15:02:34 You see
creations-chat 2020-09-15 15:02:42 My plane is tiny
creations-chat 2020-09-15 15:03:08 1x15x1
creations-chat 2020-09-15 15:03:11 For the body
creations-chat 2020-09-15 15:03:41 With half blocks as the surface
creations-chat 2020-09-15 15:03:54 So I think that makes it 2x15x2?
bug-reports 2020-09-15 15:06:33 The blocks will still attach together.
bug-reports 2020-09-15 15:07:04 And you would have to put something to hold it up anyway so that isn‚Äôt really a bug
bug-reports 2020-09-15 15:11:52 It doesn‚Äôt open right?
bug-reports 2020-09-15 15:12:02 If that‚Äôs what your trying to say
creations-chat 2020-09-15 15:16:39 Wat?
bug-reports 2020-09-15 15:51:34 You pinged the wrong guy
bug-reports 2020-09-15 15:51:45 <:YouTried:559530066258821131>
bug-reports 2020-09-16 00:27:13 It has been since release
bug-reports 2020-09-18 16:40:00 Just confirm it‚Äôs a actual bug in the game by rejoining.
bug-reports 2020-09-18 16:40:15 Because lag tends to be unpredictable
creations-chat 2020-09-18 16:52:25 Make the tip better
creations-chat 2020-09-18 16:53:07 my top will just be autocorrected to TOP

creations-chat 2020-09-18 16:55:36 So your saying you dint use motors to control your wing surfaces
creations-chat 2020-09-18 16:56:24 > well actually some planes cant fly upside down
<@587393222855229457> all planes can fly upside down because their all in the air
creations-chat 2020-09-18 16:56:30 Even airliners
creations-chat 2020-09-18 16:56:42 But they won‚Äôt fly so well upside down
creations-chat 2020-09-18 16:56:47 Yes
creations-chat 2020-09-18 16:56:57 Ever heard of trim?
creations-chat 2020-09-18 16:57:18 Yes

creations-chat 2020-09-18 16:57:48 Bruh you can nose down to go up
creations-chat 2020-09-18 16:58:05 Do you?
creations-chat 2020-09-18 16:59:30 Yeah
creations-chat 2020-09-18 17:00:11 If you don‚Äôt take the engine burning out into account all planes can do it
creations-chat 2020-09-18 17:00:36 Yes

creations-chat 2020-09-19 09:01:48 There is a certain speed where the physics throttle will not tolerate. Adding a conveyer engine will not make you go any faster as the physics throttle will take the speed divided by (100 - current physics throttle number)

bug-reports 2020-09-24 06:50:36 Whitelist leaked lol
bug-reports 2020-09-24 06:50:46 Rejoin will change your plot
bug-reports 2020-09-24 06:51:28 Joining at the same time will make the game confused and since there is no failsafe it just accepts it
bug-reports 2020-09-24 13:59:00 Mouse control?
bug-reports 2020-09-24 14:00:03 I think you should reload your build if it doesn‚Äôt work you can try rejoining.
bug-reports 2020-09-24 14:01:04 If it‚Äôs still the same after all that, call a ambulance roblox is gonna need it
bug-reports 2020-09-24 14:04:34 <:what:644996672048463942>
bug-reports 2020-09-24 14:04:51 Well that isn‚Äôt surprising actually
bug-reports 2020-09-24 14:04:57 Motor one is broken too
bug-reports 2020-09-24 14:05:08 So all the motors are broken
bug-reports 2020-09-24 14:05:31 Not in the same way but a more terrifying way
bug-reports 2020-09-24 14:05:53 Unspeakable some said
bug-reports 2020-09-24 14:06:24 Btw you can try invert if it even works on the servo
bug-reports 2020-09-24 14:24:18 Yeah.... that....
bug-reports 2020-09-24 14:24:32 Like I said roblox is having a stroke
bug-reports 2020-09-24 14:53:37 Isn‚Äôt it obvious?
the-dump 2020-09-24 15:05:05 Looking at that math question if a person loses 2 litres of blood you can just throw him to the curb side cause he is dead
the-dump 2020-09-24 15:05:26 Anything below 2 litres means death
the-dump 2020-09-24 15:05:35 So it would seem your dragging  a dead body
the-dump 2020-09-24 15:08:23 <@426802747875131393> what is the school teaching you other than murder
the-dump 2020-09-24 15:10:23 Motor lock
the-dump 2020-09-24 15:10:49 Oh he wants plates
the-dump 2020-09-24 15:11:27 If a bullet penetrates a target in plane crazy does the bullet like destroy itself?
the-dump 2020-09-24 15:12:02 Or just it just a rock flying through space that just hit a space station
help 2020-09-24 15:45:36 You can‚Äôt make motors do that in build mode
help 2020-09-24 15:45:50 So either motor lock or stay with 4 blades
the-dump 2020-09-24 15:49:35 Wdym
the-dump 2020-09-24 15:49:47 Roblox isn‚Äôt registering as movement
the-dump 2020-09-24 15:50:03 He has gone beyond the unknown
the-dump 2020-09-24 15:50:54 Yeah
the-dump 2020-09-24 15:51:00 But he is falling
the-dump 2020-09-24 15:51:30 So is he moving?
the-dump 2020-09-24 15:51:53 Eh
bug-reports 2020-09-25 03:51:42 Lag
bug-reports 2020-09-25 03:51:57 You could just ragdoll to fix it
bug-reports 2020-09-25 09:38:47 They have been since release
bug-reports 2020-09-25 09:38:58 I don‚Äôt see how that‚Äôs a surprise to you
bug-reports 2020-09-25 09:39:40 And also, new update day. What kind of bugs would roblox have created
bug-reports 2020-09-25 11:37:52 They can break moderation in one move
bug-reports 2020-09-25 16:47:14 Oh sorry
bug-reports 2020-09-25 16:48:50 > fix the lights please all my builds are ment for night and they always turn off after a minute!!!
This is something to do with computer performance. No failssafes on lights so it doesn‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs on or not. However, others can still see your light despite lacking performance
bug-reports 2020-09-26 11:24:07 You can‚Äôt fix the rockets batya
bug-reports 2020-09-26 11:24:20 Rickje can fix but the bug was created by roblox
bug-reports 2020-09-26 11:25:56 > y is my plane controls inverted with control surfaces?
Reverse your keybinds for the control panels basically making it from F and R to R and F
bug-reports 2020-09-26 11:26:59 > https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/478584971670454284/759238270813995038/unknown.png
What would you expect. Your stretching your build like a rubber band
bug-reports 2020-09-26 11:28:08 > please. fix this parachute bug it has been here for a while when you open the parachute there is a 80% chance it will literally glitch and send you flying
The bug only happens sometimes of Low performance devices which is related to roblox physics
bug-reports 2020-09-26 11:29:40 Oh yeah btw motors are dead. Pressing D and then pressing A on the motor 2 will make the motor 2 to do D instead of A
bug-reports 2020-09-26 11:30:01 So we are all gonna start crashing
bug-reports 2020-09-26 15:52:38 Good
bug-reports 2020-09-26 16:40:48 It‚Äôs on roblox
bug-reports 2020-09-26 16:41:48 Refresh error I think
bug-reports 2020-09-26 16:42:05 It will remain like this unlike the issue can be resolved
bug-reports 2020-09-26 16:42:17 But until then expect it to haunt you
bug-reports 2020-09-26 16:42:44 You still have guns and fireworks
bug-reports 2020-09-26 16:42:51 And other stuff
bug-reports 2020-09-26 16:43:01 Why not use those for the time being?
bug-reports 2020-09-26 16:43:37 Others have it too
bug-reports 2020-09-26 16:43:45 They also want it fixed
bug-reports 2020-09-26 16:44:09 If I‚Äôm not wrong rockets use to be faster than the vehicle
bug-reports 2020-09-26 16:44:35 Now they just lack behind when dogfights happen
bug-reports 2020-09-26 16:44:52 Because we travel too fast
bug-reports 2020-09-26 16:52:39 More of a down date by roblox
creations-chat 2020-09-26 16:54:52 It‚Äôs like that one video where scout tried to hit the metal cylinder but medic just magically hits it for scout
the-dump 2020-09-26 16:59:23 It will be fixed in 5 years or never
the-dump 2020-09-26 16:59:28 Take it or leave it
the-dump 2020-09-26 17:04:56 True
the-dump 2020-09-26 17:05:20 Rickje needs to create a new map before the ground collision update
the-dump 2020-09-26 17:05:37 So as to give us the feeling of being lost in a huge world
the-dump 2020-09-26 17:06:02 And just noticing we are flying into the water
the-dump 2020-09-26 17:21:35 He is not gonna do it

bug-reports 2020-09-27 05:04:46 Motor bending like It has no bones? Roblox

bug-reports 2020-09-27 05:08:24 Oh for your case <@!574023055295119380> it would pretty much be lag or either roblox is having its biggest stroke to date

the-dump 2020-09-27 05:23:14 
the-dump 2020-09-27 05:24:58 Why would Elmo eat rotten bananas
the-dump 2020-09-27 05:26:16 So a RBG light bulb has 4 wires

the-dump 2020-09-27 05:27:47 Good floating car
the-dump 2020-09-27 05:27:52 Result
the-dump 2020-09-27 05:28:13 Where are the bumpers
the-dump 2020-09-27 05:28:51 It‚Äôs a choo choo train
the-dump 2020-09-27 05:29:43 That dog ate chocolate
the-dump 2020-09-27 05:30:16 How do you destroy missiles.
1 shoot another missile at it
2 throw a rock
the-dump 2020-09-27 05:30:32 Correct answer is 2
the-dump 2020-09-27 05:30:50 Which it isn‚Äôt
the-dump 2020-09-27 05:31:01 Because if you choose 1 or 2 you would die anyway
the-dump 2020-09-27 05:31:14 So might as well die stupidly and laugh about it when your dead
the-dump 2020-09-27 05:31:44 Ever wondered what happens to a nuclear missile if it detonates mid air?
the-dump 2020-09-27 05:32:22 That‚Äôs not that high
the-dump 2020-09-27 05:32:41 they did it to cause the most damage
the-dump 2020-09-27 05:32:51 Because the houses are made of wood <:KEKW:670310537300672528>
the-dump 2020-09-27 05:33:01 It‚Äôs like the big bad wolf
the-dump 2020-09-27 05:33:11 But the nuclear version
the-dump 2020-09-27 05:33:25 
the-dump 2020-09-27 05:36:36 
the-dump 2020-09-27 05:36:39 
the-dump 2020-09-27 05:37:43 What in the LEGO city fuck?
the-dump 2020-09-27 05:43:25 https://youtu.be/uXrS2Ll3OhU
bug-reports 2020-09-27 07:22:46 Yeah but spawning is faster than doing the parachute bug
bug-reports 2020-09-27 07:23:01 Because it reaches infinite
bug-reports 2020-09-27 10:44:44 reset
bug-reports 2020-09-27 10:45:23 > my speaker wont work. my laptop has full volume and so does my speaker. if it doesnt work in the end, i want a refund.
<@627813759427018752> its a bug it should be fixed on the next update.
bug-reports 2020-09-27 10:48:05 it does happen sometime actually
bug-reports 2020-09-27 10:48:18 but i have never heard of someone asking for a refund
bug-reports 2020-09-27 10:48:46 when rickje isnt the person hosting the transactions
bug-reports 2020-09-27 12:17:35 Btw why should he get banned anyway
bug-reports 2020-09-27 12:18:12 Why should he even get banned in the first place
bug-reports 2020-09-27 12:18:20 It‚Äôs just trails
bug-reports 2020-09-27 12:18:55 It‚Äôs just a spinning trail thing
bug-reports 2020-09-27 12:19:06 Painted yellow
bug-reports 2020-09-27 12:19:38 If he is lagging the server then yeah but you shouldn‚Äôt be lagging because if he blacklists you it doesn‚Äôt lag as much
bug-reports 2020-09-27 12:23:08 It‚Äôs pretty hard to be out of objects
bug-reports 2020-09-27 14:50:48 In short you will have to rejoin the game to refresh the blacklist barriers. 
When you join a game, the blacklist barriers are invisible but active. If there is too much lag at that time, the barrier will remain active and invisible. The only way to fix the issue is by rejoining or asking people to blacklist you and unblacklist.
bug-reports 2020-09-27 14:51:52 <@!641041522090967104> if you disconnect while your build is anchored nothing will drop.
bug-reports 2020-09-27 14:52:46 > it should be fixed though as it makes magnet engines useless with <1000 part creations
<@!573197570566782977>  I will have to down vote that. Because my U-36 uses magnets to lock it in place.
bug-reports 2020-09-27 14:57:45 So you shot someone and the blocks are stuck mid air?
bug-reports 2020-09-27 14:58:06 Roblox physics in a nutshell
bug-reports 2020-09-27 14:58:19 It‚Äôs not really a bug at that point
bug-reports 2020-09-27 14:58:38 It‚Äôs more of the roblox in the emergency room
bug-reports 2020-09-27 23:05:24 Bruh you mean the button has hp?
bug-reports 2020-09-28 01:25:22 It does
bug-reports 2020-09-28 01:25:24 Rejoin
bug-reports 2020-09-28 01:25:48 Countless other people have the same issue <@!614659754249420810> but just rejoin to fix the issue
bug-reports 2020-09-28 15:08:36 It‚Äôs not even new
bug-reports 2020-09-28 15:08:47 It was a bug since the slot updates
bug-reports 2020-09-28 15:09:04 Where the blocks became 4 million
bug-reports 2020-09-28 15:12:00 The new slots are just unreliable for the time being.
bug-reports 2020-09-28 15:12:30 I suggest saving the bigger builds in the older slots
bug-reports 2020-09-28 15:21:35 Yeah I still remember
the-dump 2020-09-28 15:22:42

the-dump 2020-09-28 15:24:28 I find no need for them
the-dump 2020-09-28 15:27:55 
the-dump 2020-09-28 15:28:51 Good luck killing them
the-dump 2020-09-28 15:29:16 You need more than a knife to kill them now
the-dump 2020-09-28 15:29:28 You need guns and tanks
the-dump 2020-09-28 15:29:39 And possibly a CRAM
the-dump 2020-09-28 15:31:10 
the-dump 2020-09-28 15:33:20 > no rank
<@!573197570566782977>  ranks dint tell anyone anything but what they have done. It‚Äôs like giving a piece of paper to the police and telling them ‚Äú I‚Äôm a cop‚Äù

the-dump 2020-09-28 15:37:24 I lost my wing
the-dump 2020-09-28 15:37:33 Is that a cause for concern
the-dump 2020-09-28 15:38:34 I can go 10 k
the-dump 2020-09-28 15:38:44 I know
the-dump 2020-09-28 15:39:08 I just go 10k to drag race people in a plane
the-dump 2020-09-28 15:39:32 I toy with a van
the-dump 2020-09-28 15:39:39 It becomes a rally car
the-dump 2020-09-28 15:40:04 I prefer having aim
the-dump 2020-09-28 15:40:13 Because as of now I can‚Äôt aim for shit
the-dump 2020-09-28 15:40:34 I mean with motor 2s

the-dump 2020-09-28 15:41:47 I mean it‚Äôs fine
the-dump 2020-09-28 15:41:53 But I don‚Äôt use it
the-dump 2020-09-28 15:42:13 My plane can‚Äôt survive 11k speed
the-dump 2020-09-28 15:42:20 Or 20k
the-dump 2020-09-28 15:42:52 Mine too actually

the-dump 2020-09-28 15:45:07

bug-reports 2020-10-21 09:35:49 For what
bug-reports 2020-10-21 15:28:46 A theory is that we kept on shooting the pilot seats which causes the bug because everytime we shoot the plane and that bug occurs, it just only shows a flying pilot seat.
However if your skilled enough you can use missiles to shoot the vehicle. That will result in the destruction of the vehicle.
bug-reports 2020-10-21 15:29:05 Missiles aren‚Äôt affected by the bug, but your aim is.

bug-reports 2020-11-07 06:25:00 For the parachute ragdoll bug, it isn‚Äôt really a bug. It‚Äôs the roblox game engine compensating for the drag that your parachute is giving you. However this itself can trigger the parachute bug where you either go up really high or go down really far.

bug-reports 2020-11-10 12:30:01 It happens everynow and then
bug-reports 2020-11-10 12:30:12 And it‚Äôs making it very obvious
bug-reports 2020-11-10 12:30:51 The buggiest part about it is that you can clip into the front of other vehicles and fling them
bug-reports 2020-11-10 12:32:19 Actually

bug-reports 2020-11-14 12:13:00 Because the stage being connected by magnets (if super strength isn‚Äôt on) ,tends to slide away from where it‚Äôs suppose to be. And magnets take time to attract each other sometimes leaving gaps in between magnets

the-dump 2020-11-17 04:35:13 But in another language
bug-reports 2020-11-17 04:36:43 You use motor 1s to form the plane?
bug-reports 2020-11-17 04:36:56 Use motor 2s
bug-reports 2020-11-17 04:37:57 Go on
bug-reports 2020-11-17 04:38:24 Do you have a landing gear door
bug-reports 2020-11-17 04:38:48 So it‚Äôs just a piston that extends to push the landing gear down
bug-reports 2020-11-17 04:39:53 I think your front landing gear is attracted to something
bug-reports 2020-11-17 04:39:58 Like it‚Äôs part of the plane
bug-reports 2020-11-17 04:40:05 So the piston is pushing the entire plane down
bug-reports 2020-11-17 04:40:15 But it can‚Äôt be pushed down so it glitches out
bug-reports 2020-11-17 04:40:26 Ik
bug-reports 2020-11-17 04:40:27 I saw it
bug-reports 2020-11-17 04:40:38 Your front landing gear glitchs out
bug-reports 2020-11-17 04:41:26 I don‚Äôt see any pistons
bug-reports 2020-11-17 04:41:34 Wait.
bug-reports 2020-11-17 04:41:41 That‚Äôs a rope
bug-reports 2020-11-17 04:42:36 The back landing gear is fine though
bug-reports 2020-11-17 04:43:02 Would you like to know why
bug-reports 2020-11-17 04:43:12 Because your pulling your landing gear through the floor
bug-reports 2020-11-17 04:43:19 Ropes are powerful
bug-reports 2020-11-17 04:43:30 But if you retract them too much they break the landing gear
bug-reports 2020-11-17 04:43:36 Causing your plane to spaz out
bug-reports 2020-11-17 04:43:58 But you need them to retract
bug-reports 2020-11-17 04:44:30 Ropes can retract until it becomes a half block
bug-reports 2020-11-17 04:44:46 But the clearance you have is lesser than half a block
bug-reports 2020-11-17 04:44:54 So it pulls your landing gear into the floor
bug-reports 2020-11-17 04:45:06 But there are no pistons!
bug-reports 2020-11-17 04:45:20 <:what:644996672048463942>
bug-reports 2020-11-17 04:46:39 You might as well just use the pistons as both the landing gear retraction and the extension
bug-reports 2020-11-17 04:49:00 I mean it‚Äôs touching your planes floor
bug-reports 2020-11-17 04:49:14 When you retract too much it goes through your plane
bug-reports 2020-11-17 04:49:43 It doesn‚Äôt work that way
bug-reports 2020-11-17 04:49:56 The ropes are stronger than pistons
bug-reports 2020-11-17 04:51:22 <:CertifiedMoment:570774089099116548>
bug-reports 2020-11-17 04:51:52 Don‚Äôt over retract the ropes
bug-reports 2020-11-17 04:52:01 Or the landing gear will go through the floor
bug-reports 2020-11-17 04:52:06 Literally
bug-reports 2020-11-17 04:53:31 Then nothing will happen

bug-reports 2020-11-17 05:00:45 That‚Äôs what‚Äôs happening
bug-reports 2020-11-17 05:00:50 But you have a lot of landing gears
bug-reports 2020-11-17 05:00:56 So the effect is more pronoun
bug-reports 2020-11-17 05:18:49 No
bug-reports 2020-11-17 05:18:58 Just don‚Äôt over retract them
bug-reports 2020-11-17 05:19:07 Make they sway a little
bug-reports 2020-11-17 05:20:31 Then I‚Äôm not sure
bug-reports 2020-11-17 05:20:40 But it could be the pistons stuck on something
bug-reports 2020-11-17 11:44:12 The bug is mainly affected by processing power and lag.
bug-reports 2020-11-17 11:44:32 And no it‚Äôs not on plane crazy‚Äôs side
bug-reports 2020-11-17 12:11:27 > just remove parachutes hitbox
No
bug-reports 2020-11-17 12:12:00 The reason why parachutes were made was to mock about how bad peoples processing power is.
bug-reports 2020-11-17 17:38:06 > you only need a goddamn high-end pc or laptop
It depends. From what I have tested it seemed like the higher end PCs avoid the bug more often. However lag is also one that can cause the bug so I‚Äôm not sure. I have tested this on my low end laptop and it doesn‚Äôt seem to trigger the bug as often.
bug-reports 2020-11-17 17:40:11 > Thats if you put the torquq to 50
Then why not higher? Anyway clean your damn room. There‚Äôs even a switch Carthage under your computer
bug-reports 2020-11-17 17:40:51 > and yes the thing that im following with my cursor is the ,,plane,, that got hit and you can only see half wedge down, and trapdoor flyin
It has been a bug for a long time now. Even though you can‚Äôt see most parts of the plane your missiles can.
bug-reports 2020-11-17 17:41:27 Btw nerf you don‚Äôt need a super computer to avoid the parachute bug

bug-reports 2020-11-20 14:08:40 Even if there is a hardcode error, it will never do that
bug-reports 2020-11-20 14:08:58 So I think there‚Äôs someone controlling It
bug-reports 2020-11-21 05:45:09 For motor lock to work properly, use the lock feature only and turn the power off for the motor.

bug-reports 2020-11-21 18:25:52 It‚Äôs powered
bug-reports 2020-11-21 18:26:16 To make a motor lock it needs to be **unpowered**
bug-reports 2020-11-21 18:26:29 And locked
bug-reports 2020-11-21 18:26:36 I do
bug-reports 2020-11-21 18:26:53 Why wouldn‚Äôt I

bug-reports 2020-11-21 18:28:32 Motor 1s tend to destabilise when a certain amount of force is placed on it that only goes in 1 direction
bug-reports 2020-11-21 18:28:52 Or away from the motor
bug-reports 2020-11-21 18:29:29 Without a counter force the motors base plate will mysteriously extend away from itself
bug-reports 2020-11-21 18:29:50 Thus the lock doesn‚Äôt work
bug-reports 2020-11-21 18:30:17 You know the brown part of the motor

bug-reports 2020-11-21 18:32:09 To make it spin faster than 50 speed
bug-reports 2020-11-21 18:33:02 If you stack the motors and make them move they also separate from themselves

the-dump 2020-11-25 12:46:26 But ping is always rounded off
the-dump 2020-11-25 12:46:31 So expect it to be 0-1

bug-reports 2020-12-06 10:57:19 That is on you
bug-reports 2020-12-06 10:57:35 What I can suggest is making the motor torque less powerful
bug-reports 2020-12-06 10:57:36 Or.
bug-reports 2020-12-06 10:57:48 Ditch the fold entirely when in the water
bug-reports 2020-12-06 10:57:58 Which requires a magnet
creations-chat 2020-12-06 11:01:38 There is a way to fix that
creations-chat 2020-12-06 11:05:31 Magnets but doing that would mean you ditch your fold. It can stop the glitch from happening but it will cause lag. Or if you want you can try changing the angle to 179.9999 and torque set to 30
creations-chat 2020-12-06 11:08:42 I have magnets on my ship too but I have support beams to support the build when straightening. I basically unanchor, turn on the magnet, move around abit and release the folding motor

the-dump 2020-12-06 18:10:43 That doesn‚Äôt mean it doesn‚Äôt kill us
the-dump 2020-12-06 18:11:01 The moon is basically a astroid at that point
the-dump 2020-12-06 18:11:12 And also
the-dump 2020-12-06 18:11:21 The sun isn‚Äôt a metal planet
the-dump 2020-12-06 18:11:39 What
the-dump 2020-12-06 18:11:53 Do you want me to call it a meteor instead
the-dump 2020-12-06 18:12:03 Ik

the-dump 2020-12-06 18:14:13 Then where do we get steak?
the-dump 2020-12-06 18:14:24 Oxford?
the-dump 2020-12-06 18:14:38 Then how about the milk
the-dump 2020-12-06 18:14:45 Hm?
the-dump 2020-12-06 18:15:03 You reverse engineered cheese
the-dump 2020-12-06 18:15:05 To make
the-dump 2020-12-06 18:15:07 Milk?
the-dump 2020-12-06 18:15:10 Wat?
the-dump 2020-12-06 18:15:22 What kind of science am I Hearing
the-dump 2020-12-06 18:15:46 The moon is the cow
the-dump 2020-12-06 18:16:07 We fly there again
the-dump 2020-12-06 18:16:22 We went to the moon 50 years ago
the-dump 2020-12-06 18:16:34 So why not do it again
the-dump 2020-12-06 18:16:50 We did it 7 times
the-dump 2020-12-06 18:16:54 Hm
the-dump 2020-12-06 18:17:24 Are you sure about that
the-dump 2020-12-06 18:17:40 I can show you a video to prove you wrong

the-dump 2020-12-06 18:18:45 Containing cheese
the-dump 2020-12-06 18:18:53 The worlds most expensive cheese
the-dump 2020-12-06 18:19:40 That particular type of cheese is just stored in circular box‚Äôs
the-dump 2020-12-06 18:19:49 And isn‚Äôt refrigerated
the-dump 2020-12-06 18:19:53 I think
the-dump 2020-12-06 18:20:07 But they are in the shape of wheels
the-dump 2020-12-06 18:20:19 Cheese wheels
the-dump 2020-12-06 18:20:42 Chevelution

bug-reports 2020-12-06 18:23:31 If it isn‚Äôt fixed it would mean it either cannot be replicated or lag
bug-reports 2020-12-06 18:23:48 Yes rickje needs to find the source

bug-reports 2020-12-07 05:11:58 He doesn‚Äôt reply because he is scared of backlash from the community
bug-reports 2020-12-07 05:12:20 Like any regrets when he release something or fix something

the-dump 2020-12-07 11:38:43 So that‚Äôs how cars drive on water
bug-reports 2020-12-07 11:41:20 But your starting to behave like valve
the-dump 2020-12-07 11:46:03 It‚Äôs upside down
the-dump 2020-12-07 11:46:20 But we can‚Äôt rule out abuse
the-dump 2020-12-07 11:46:24 Not enough evidence
bug-reports 2020-12-07 11:47:47 Hm
bug-reports 2020-12-07 11:47:58 Are you sure
bug-reports 2020-12-07 11:48:22 <@!419873641229189120> does it not work when you launch the vehicle
bug-reports 2020-12-07 11:49:14 You mean when your building?
bug-reports 2020-12-07 11:49:23 Hm
bug-reports 2020-12-07 11:49:31 Prob roblox back at it again
bug-reports 2020-12-07 11:49:57 I wonder if rickje can add thing without anything breaking temporarily
bug-reports 2020-12-07 11:50:08 Because it‚Äôs softcode
bug-reports 2020-12-07 11:50:14 Plane Crazy is Hardcoded
bug-reports 2020-12-07 11:50:47 We do need more wedges

the-dump 2020-12-07 12:04:41 Using that is basically saying: I can drive on water
the-dump 2020-12-07 12:04:49 Basically <:JesusWheel:652563443114836008>
the-dump 2020-12-07 12:04:57 But spiky
the-dump 2020-12-07 12:05:18 No not really
the-dump 2020-12-07 12:05:29 I‚Äôm sure a F150 can‚Äôt drive on water
the-dump 2020-12-07 12:05:39 Well
the-dump 2020-12-07 12:05:44 Maybe the other car can‚Äôt too
the-dump 2020-12-07 12:06:06 Top gear is stand alone
the-dump 2020-12-07 12:06:18 The grand tour is also stand alone
the-dump 2020-12-07 12:06:37 The trio is in the grand tour

the-dump 2020-12-07 12:11:05 And yes
the-dump 2020-12-07 12:11:18 There is no divert power to reactor task
the-dump 2020-12-07 12:11:36 There was a feature about it
the-dump 2020-12-07 12:11:41 But it never got added
the-dump 2020-12-07 12:12:22 No
the-dump 2020-12-07 12:12:35 But they have a new person in their team
the-dump 2020-12-07 12:12:49 Victoria
the-dump 2020-12-07 12:13:08 Who recently got added to innersloth
the-dump 2020-12-07 12:23:59 Aemu
the-dump 2020-12-07 12:47:16 What‚Äôs wrong?
the-dump 2020-12-07 12:47:25 It‚Äôs not like we are obsessed with it
the-dump 2020-12-07 12:47:31 We are just talking about it
the-dump 2020-12-07 12:55:14 Imma make a ** S P A C E** elevator
the-dump 2020-12-07 12:55:33 A elevator that goes to space
the-dump 2020-12-07 12:55:58 I wonder how many folds can roblox tak e
the-dump 2020-12-07 12:56:01 Take
the-dump 2020-12-07 12:56:17 Because I think my space elevator will need 20
the-dump 2020-12-07 12:56:49 Oh really?
the-dump 2020-12-07 12:56:51 How so?
the-dump 2020-12-07 12:57:08 But how
the-dump 2020-12-07 12:57:10 In what way
the-dump 2020-12-07 12:57:16 Does it spaz out?
the-dump 2020-12-07 12:57:37 Ah
the-dump 2020-12-07 12:57:48 I have a way of fixing that
the-dump 2020-12-07 12:58:03 Anchoring every single rail for the space elevator
the-dump 2020-12-07 12:58:32 Me about to break roblox
the-dump 2020-12-07 12:58:47 Going to 10000 studs and beyond
the-dump 2020-12-07 12:59:06 I remember roblox borders is at 50000 studs
the-dump 2020-12-07 12:59:17 Probably not
the-dump 2020-12-07 12:59:27 But you can go up on it
the-dump 2020-12-07 12:59:36 At the cost of your life savings
the-dump 2020-12-07 12:59:52 One that could possibly reach the roblox game breaking border
the-dump 2020-12-07 12:59:58 That makes you go pankcako
the-dump 2020-12-07 13:00:22 Nah
the-dump 2020-12-07 13:00:26 That shit is too easy
the-dump 2020-12-07 13:00:34 We going to the moon on rails
the-dump 2020-12-07 13:00:45 üòé
the-dump 2020-12-07 13:01:06 Hm
the-dump 2020-12-07 13:01:21 Mines pretty bare-bone already
the-dump 2020-12-07 13:01:27 4 studs
the-dump 2020-12-07 13:01:34 That act like rails
the-dump 2020-12-07 13:01:53 But between them
the-dump 2020-12-07 13:02:00 Is 3 block wide gaps
the-dump 2020-12-07 13:02:21 Maybe enough for missiles to go through
the-dump 2020-12-07 13:02:27 But not for planes
the-dump 2020-12-07 13:02:56 I think it should be how would shredder bugs hit me while turning
the-dump 2020-12-07 13:03:08 Because their turning radius is small
the-dump 2020-12-07 13:03:18 But the size of the studs are smaller
the-dump 2020-12-07 13:03:43 I have ways to counter them
the-dump 2020-12-07 13:03:51 Lag
the-dump 2020-12-07 13:04:14 Lmao
the-dump 2020-12-07 13:04:20 Magnet propelled elevator
the-dump 2020-12-07 13:05:30 I think he need more than that
the-dump 2020-12-07 13:05:43 Because the elevator is anchored
the-dump 2020-12-07 13:05:46 It won‚Äôt fall
the-dump 2020-12-07 13:05:52 But it can fail
the-dump 2020-12-07 13:06:03 Infact
the-dump 2020-12-07 13:06:18 I don‚Äôt think the space elevator can reach 15000 studs
the-dump 2020-12-07 13:06:49 True
the-dump 2020-12-07 13:06:59 But the elevator is pretty bare bone already
the-dump 2020-12-07 13:07:08 Only enough for one person
the-dump 2020-12-07 13:07:27 No
the-dump 2020-12-07 13:07:29 Because
the-dump 2020-12-07 13:07:33 I‚Äôm not on my computer

bug-reports 2020-12-09 12:25:51 Lag is the main cause
bug-reports 2020-12-10 06:11:53 Depends on what torque you use

the-dump 2020-12-10 06:26:40 The roblox name doesn‚Äôt include the tag
the-dump 2020-12-10 06:26:53 So it won‚Äôt show the discord name

bug-reports 2020-12-10 08:18:06 That can be used too

bug-reports 2020-12-11 06:44:45 It could be lag.
bug-reports 2020-12-11 06:45:09 It depends on how good the internet connection is when your loading the boat.
bug-reports 2020-12-11 06:45:28 If you don‚Äôt mind, you can try launching the boat again.

help 2020-12-23 20:15:00 So the save won‚Äôt get touched
bug-reports 2020-12-24 12:05:14 This bug normally happens when you use guns against people. And sometimes missiles. There is currently no fix
bug-reports 2020-12-24 12:06:04 Copy and Paste still works for me and working fine. Maybe it‚Äôs the hardcode aspect of the signs that is affecting it
bug-reports 2020-12-24 12:29:07 Indeed it‚Äôs normal if you don‚Äôt destroy the target in one shot. Because of how the missile explode on impact, it creates a sphere around the missile. But every hit by a missile is 1 shot (except tnt) so since it‚Äôs a sphere some blocks thinks that it‚Äôs hit and some parts of the blocks isn‚Äôt. Rickje solved this by putting the code so as when the block is touching the sphere it disappears however he didn‚Äôt account for the seats which has separate parts like the 2 hand rests, the base the top part and the back rest they are all separate parts thus the game gets confused because the red part of the vehicle is the only thing required to move the vehicle, you only see the red part of the seat which indicates the the base or the headrest has been shot off.
bug-reports 2020-12-24 12:29:32 I just remembered. There is a way to fix it. Shooting the invisible plane again
bug-reports 2020-12-24 12:29:40 Refreshing the blocks and making it visible
bug-reports 2020-12-24 12:29:56 It shouldn‚Äôt be a issue because missiles can still see the vehicle

bug-reports 2020-12-31 17:43:56 It‚Äôs a spawn protection mechanism to backfire onto the spawn camper. You shouldn‚Äôt even be using a turret anyway because it‚Äôs stupid
bug-reports 2020-12-31 17:46:11 The light thing isn‚Äôt a bug from plane crazy. I think it‚Äôs more of the game engine and factors of lag because the light tends to turn off in laggy situations. However they shouldn‚Äôt turn off for the others.
bug-reports 2021-01-01 06:13:00 Do you think rickje can fix that weird invisible missile bug though?
bug-reports 2021-01-01 06:13:33 Because there are a lot of bug rickje can‚Äôt fix because of hardcode and that bug you have is one of them.

bug-reports 2021-01-07 07:27:21 Yeah it‚Äôs a roblox thing. They tend to crash because of lag machines.
bug-reports 2021-01-07 07:28:05 At that point either you leave the server and join a new one, or use a lag machine to fix chat by lagging it.
bug-reports 2021-01-07 07:29:44 Your propellers are spinning too fast.
Setting the speed to 50 makes the tip of propeller go to a speed comparable to a hyper sonic jet add a rope on each propellers so they won‚Äôt fly away.
bug-reports 2021-01-07 07:33:33 Just add a rope
bug-reports 2021-01-07 07:33:52 That‚Äôs why no one models a helicopter first before making the systems.

bug-reports 2021-01-07 22:54:28 Ever since roblox updated their game 3 months ago the motor2s became abit wonky and drunk like. So if you selected a keybind like F your motor will go one way depending on where you set it to. However if you set it to R it will still turn the same way it turned previously.
You will have to train the motor 2 to stop being a massive bitch and work properly or keep changing keybinds until it works.
bug-reports 2021-01-08 04:56:26 Reset basically makes motor 1 go back to the nearest 90 degree angle.
bug-reports 2021-01-08 04:56:37 So it depends on what kind of buggy your talking about
bug-reports 2021-01-08 04:58:11 I assume your wheels are shaking. 
Reset is suppose to make the motor return to the nearest 90 degree angle thus the shaking
bug-reports 2021-01-08 04:59:42 It‚Äôs not a bug it‚Äôs a intended feature which you don‚Äôt know how to utilise.

the-dump 2021-01-16 07:17:33 Lenovo too has thin screens
the-dump 2021-01-16 07:17:37 But no one complains
the-dump 2021-01-16 07:17:47 Why does Apple have to be the one who gets complaints
the-dump 2021-01-16 07:18:39 Samsung also has thin screen in their phone
the-dump 2021-01-16 07:18:44 But no one complaints

bug-reports 2021-01-16 17:02:36 You might have to do that, save it into another slot, double save the build or just start over because I know it‚Äôs not gonna look good.
bug-reports 2021-01-16 17:08:08 You could just not use them outright or just server hop

bug-reports 2021-01-16 17:18:57 It sometimes works
bug-reports 2021-01-16 17:19:15 Roblox chat filter is just a buggy mess
bug-reports 2021-01-16 17:19:52 It works at filtering out words its suppose to filter but also filters out words that it‚Äôs not suppose to filter at the same time

bug-reports 2021-01-17 01:14:30 Because SAM turrets don‚Äôt fly
bug-reports 2021-01-17 03:15:51 But you don‚Äôt need them anyway because infame missiles are already guided
bug-reports 2021-01-17 03:17:03 The only disadvantages about in game missile is that it is range. However by tricking the game into thinking your moving very quickly, you can extend the range to reach practically anywhere. It‚Äôs just depending on your prediction

creations-chat 2021-01-18 02:15:43 Looks like hell to me
bug-reports 2021-01-18 04:38:54 Guns are never broken but missile will sometimes break.
bug-reports 2021-01-18 04:41:31 Because pvp wasn‚Äôt on?
bug-reports 2021-01-18 04:41:34 Besides
bug-reports 2021-01-18 04:41:44 Engines don‚Äôt go down in 1 hit
bug-reports 2021-01-18 04:41:47 Unless if it‚Äôs a missile
bug-reports 2021-01-18 09:12:48 That‚Äôs why barely anyone uses guns
bug-reports 2021-01-18 09:12:54 Unless your ground forces
bug-reports 2021-01-18 09:14:03 It‚Äôs blurry because phones can‚Äôt handle PC graphics.
bug-reports 2021-01-18 09:14:18 Shoot it down with fireworks or missiles
bug-reports 2021-01-18 09:15:00 Missiles work on both

bug-reports 2021-01-18 14:23:13 It‚Äôs not a suggestion
Your self suggesting 
You won‚Äôt stop arguing about mobile being unable to render PC type of graphics when they are in every game 
And you won‚Äôt shut the fuck up because you have this illness that is telling you a PC is bad.
bug-reports 2021-01-18 14:23:33 Just
bug-reports 2021-01-18 14:23:39 Get a fucking PC
bug-reports 2021-01-18 14:23:45 It‚Äôs not that hard
bug-reports 2021-01-18 14:24:05 And yet you argue about it like you can‚Äôt afford to get one
bug-reports 2021-01-18 14:24:24 Infact your not even the one who is going to pay for that PC if you ask your parents!
bug-reports 2021-01-18 14:24:51 Well you have to

bug-reports 2021-01-18 14:32:43 I got mine from an expo
bug-reports 2021-01-18 14:32:45 Think again
bug-reports 2021-01-18 14:33:25 You will need a laptop to use for school anyway
bug-reports 2021-01-18 14:33:37 And if they don‚Äôt understand
bug-reports 2021-01-18 14:33:43 Save up to get one
bug-reports 2021-01-18 14:33:48 A cheap one will do
bug-reports 2021-01-18 14:34:07 It works everywhere
bug-reports 2021-01-18 14:34:32 Quarantine?
bug-reports 2021-01-18 14:34:34 Lockdown?
bug-reports 2021-01-18 14:34:48 You have been using a iPad?

bug-reports 2021-01-18 22:56:30 You can‚Äôt run roblox on chromebook without some house fires
bug-reports 2021-01-18 22:57:02 Those games are Jetpack joyride and candy crunch
bug-reports 2021-01-18 22:57:15 That‚Äôs why the chromebook is bad
bug-reports 2021-01-18 22:57:30 It has 2-4 GBs of RAM no GPU and bad CPU
bug-reports 2021-01-18 22:57:40 Nah
bug-reports 2021-01-18 22:57:49 Practically impossible at that point
bug-reports 2021-01-18 22:58:24 But mobile has GPUs
bug-reports 2021-01-18 22:58:29 And more ram
bug-reports 2021-01-18 22:58:34 And better CPUs
bug-reports 2021-01-18 22:58:45 (Most of the time)
bug-reports 2021-01-18 23:01:04 Someone made a video about playing minecraft on a chromebook. 8 FPS max and minecraft is less demanding than roblox so I don‚Äôt think I will even show a frame

bug-reports 2021-01-23 05:38:47 On impact works properly
bug-reports 2021-01-23 05:39:00 It‚Äôs just that the walls of the barrel is also considered a impact point
bug-reports 2021-01-23 05:39:30 Code confusion?
bug-reports 2021-01-23 05:40:28 I think self protection has code collision with the explosive part of the ball code
bug-reports 2021-01-23 05:40:51 Or you could just be shooting them too fast
bug-reports 2021-01-23 05:41:27 Mine works when it‚Äôs slower

the-dump 2021-02-06 14:33:02 Not create a alt is one of them
the-dump 2021-02-06 14:33:09 Evading bans is bad
the-dump 2021-02-06 14:33:32 All you do is just make you remember more about why you got banned

bug-reports 2021-02-16 23:00:42 That‚Äôs on your train. You could just use stock wheels provided by rickje but suffer on slow speeds
bug-reports 2021-02-16 23:07:19 Solution 1: it isn‚Äôt a bug. It‚Äôs a area to let your computer render while your on the loading screen. Which is closest to the canyon, on the far right sides of the field and away from the terrain.
Solution 2: this isn‚Äôt a bug. It happens because your having Low FPS or bad ping and since your on water (the laggiest place on the plane crazy map) you will encounter these things most of the time.
Solution 3: just move the build with tool 4.
Solution 4: motor 2s have been known to be extremely weak and sometimes Unreliable. No one puts engines on anything but inside the plane is exactly why you don‚Äôt ruin the looks of your plane.

bug-reports 2021-02-17 06:00:58 Then that isn‚Äôt our problem
bug-reports 2021-02-17 06:01:05 You see
bug-reports 2021-02-17 06:01:22 The game code relys on your computer to execute it
bug-reports 2021-02-17 06:01:41 Because you had kinda a Low FPS it refreshes itself at that set fps
bug-reports 2021-02-17 06:01:53 It will keep changing as long as your FPS change
bug-reports 2021-02-17 06:02:22 So you can‚Äôt blame rickje for making the game laggy.

bug-reports 2021-02-17 23:04:34 Maybe rickje simplified the code a little
bug-reports 2021-02-17 23:05:05 It‚Äôs either intended or just a mistake
bug-reports 2021-02-17 23:05:55 Intended would mean that bullets go down to the ground after hitting the water (bullets aren‚Äôt even suppose to be able to travel in water anyway)

creations-chat 2021-02-21 05:03:12 The builds tail is short, the vertical stabiliser is big or the elevator is small, the helicopter has 4 blades, some exposed motorlock and cannot be controlled via swashplate

Because it‚Äôs the internet
bug-reports 2021-02-21 15:04:05 Yeah it‚Äôs a intended feature.
bug-reports 2021-02-21 15:04:38 It appears like this so that it wouldn‚Äôt have to kill your pc rendering and unrendering the particles
bug-reports 2021-02-21 15:05:06 It‚Äôs like the source engine rending bunny scout, with fire hat and other stuff

bug-reports 2021-02-21 15:11:32 Also enlarging the particle thing would mean it will clip through the Easter egg island in some cases so rickje wanted the snow to attract people to the bunker.
bug-reports 2021-02-21 22:42:13 That‚Äôs the Easter event. Maybe rickje will update the island to do a proper rickroll
bug-reports 2021-02-21 22:46:50 Better idea.

bug-reports 2021-02-22 00:55:53 Getting a better performance device helps too

bug-reports 2021-02-22 09:02:00 Explain
bug-reports 2021-02-22 09:03:10 And how good is the wifi and what‚Äôs the ping

bug-reports 2021-02-28 02:54:32 I think roblox knows the time we have on plane crazy

bug-reports 2021-03-01 11:12:11 My guess is a bug in displaying the time
bug-reports 2021-03-01 11:45:36 That‚Äôs because it keeps resetting

bug-reports 2021-03-03 15:40:38 So what‚Äôs the problem
bug-reports 2021-03-03 15:40:48 Because propellers cannot collide with objects

bug-reports 2021-03-03 15:42:12 If too much force is applied on the suspension it will collapse and collide into itself

bug-reports 2021-03-15 12:24:31 You press control C not C
bug-reports 2021-03-15 12:24:57 Only some people
bug-reports 2021-03-15 12:26:08 Just c and v?
bug-reports 2021-03-15 12:26:18 Huh I don‚Äôt know that
bug-reports 2021-03-15 12:26:38 I‚Äôve been pressing Crtl C and Crtl V for Melinda
bug-reports 2021-03-15 13:06:30 No
bug-reports 2021-03-15 13:06:31 And
bug-reports 2021-03-15 13:06:33 I disagree
bug-reports 2021-03-15 13:06:55 Most of the people in this community hasn‚Äôt gotten the copy and past bug
bug-reports 2021-03-15 13:06:58 Infact
bug-reports 2021-03-15 13:07:12 I‚Äôve encountered it but it just faded
bug-reports 2021-03-15 13:07:17 And fixed itself
bug-reports 2021-03-15 13:18:44 That‚Äôs not what I‚Äôm saying
bug-reports 2021-03-15 13:18:49 You see.
bug-reports 2021-03-15 13:18:57 I use to have this problem
bug-reports 2021-03-15 13:19:04 Now it‚Äôs practically not a problem anymore
bug-reports 2021-03-15 13:19:28 Then why make the report??
bug-reports 2021-03-15 13:19:49 :facepalm 100:
bug-reports 2021-03-15 13:20:35 Might as well not respond to someone
bug-reports 2021-03-15 13:20:50 Seeing that this has been repeated
bug-reports 2021-03-15 13:20:52 Several times
bug-reports 2021-03-15 23:09:08 Kicked out of the game?
bug-reports 2021-03-16 01:43:26 Wdym. Obviously others can‚Äôt see your Centre of gravity ball
bug-reports 2021-03-16 01:43:49 And if there is a problem with it. Just reset or launch the plane and go back to plot

the-dump 2021-03-16 02:19:51 Oh wait
the-dump 2021-03-16 02:19:56 I‚Äôm still on idle
bug-reports 2021-03-16 03:21:24 Set to servo
bug-reports 2021-03-16 03:37:16 You could just set it to 2 random keybinds
bot-central 2021-03-16 11:07:32 !servers
bug-reports 2021-03-16 14:52:47 You can‚Äôt Toggle a servo
bug-reports 2021-03-16 14:53:57 You could add a extra wall
bug-reports 2021-03-16 14:54:31 How do you toggle on a motor 2?
bug-reports 2021-03-16 14:54:39 <:bruhaps:646045387911725106>
bug-reports 2021-03-16 14:54:57 <:KEKW:670310537300672528>
bug-reports 2021-03-16 14:56:15 Wait
bug-reports 2021-03-16 14:56:27 Oh yeah you can toggle
bug-reports 2021-03-16 14:56:45 But what‚Äôs the point of it‚Äôs supposed to be a hinge <:Thonk:509498568982134816>
bug-reports 2021-03-17 10:04:55 Bullets, if touching the ground, will slow down dramatically. However shooting through the landscape would mean that the area around you is deformed. It will go back to normal as soon as the computer has rendered it.
bug-reports 2021-03-17 10:05:22 I don‚Äôt think rickje has control over the deformation process
bug-reports 2021-03-17 10:05:47 Lower end PCs can see the world degenerate around them.
bug-reports 2021-03-17 10:05:48 Like me
bug-reports 2021-03-17 10:06:05 It basically becomes big polygons above the actual world
bug-reports 2021-03-17 10:06:28 It‚Äôs used gain more performance.
bug-reports 2021-03-17 10:06:46 But I‚Äôm not sure if roblox implemented it or rickje coded it
bug-reports 2021-03-17 10:12:35 No.
bug-reports 2021-03-17 10:12:47 Its terrain deformation
bug-reports 2021-03-17 10:12:56 I‚Äôll try to find an example
bug-reports 2021-03-17 10:15:12 I don‚Äôt think I can find one
bug-reports 2021-03-17 10:16:08 But just picture a set of polygons above a chunk. Then if you get closer to it, you will realise it‚Äôs either sinking or disappeared.
bug-reports 2021-03-17 10:16:12 It‚Äôs like a loading screen
bug-reports 2021-03-17 10:16:17 But it happens in game
bug-reports 2021-03-17 10:40:23 You mean it becomes degenerated
bug-reports 2021-03-17 13:21:23 Check if both magnets are at the same keybind
bug-reports 2021-03-18 02:36:49 It happens in other games too.
bug-reports 2021-03-18 02:37:12 It normally happens when the server got hit by a lag machine
bug-reports 2021-03-18 02:37:24 The only way to revert it back is to lag machine the server again
bug-reports 2021-03-18 02:38:55 Rickje is currently using the robloxs default texture. It changes from time to time depending on the software used to download it.

bug-reports 2021-03-19 02:59:36 If these crashes are true, most of us would not be playing plane crazy anymore. It could be fixed when softcode is released.
bug-reports 2021-03-19 06:49:55 Plane Crazy has nothing to do with roblox‚Äôs audio purge
bug-reports 2021-03-19 06:50:41 Roblox issue. Phantom forces is also having the same problem with their torch lights
bug-reports 2021-03-19 07:34:59 Normal. It happens from time to time
bug-reports 2021-03-19 07:36:53 Yes they too happen from time to time. It‚Äôs caused by lag.
bug-reports 2021-03-19 07:37:07 The only way to fix it, is to just reload your build
bug-reports 2021-03-19 07:41:17 Flip the keybinds
bug-reports 2021-03-19 07:41:30 And if it‚Äôs still happening, flip the keybinds back
help 2021-03-19 07:42:26 You can kinda fix it with the use of motor 1s and suspensions. It‚Äôs basically a suppression system / dampener
the-dump 2021-03-19 08:05:41 I don‚Äôt see how constantly updating the game is relevant to this urban dictionary

bug-reports 2021-03-19 12:35:04 Something to do with performance I guess
bug-reports 2021-03-19 12:35:09 It‚Äôs like anchored
bug-reports 2021-03-19 12:35:14 Until a specific distance
bug-reports 2021-03-19 12:35:31 Or until your creation is close enough to the object
bug-reports 2021-03-19 12:36:36 If I‚Äôm not wrong, anything disconnected, released or anything that has been dropped with a intention to drop will drop and not be anchored
bug-reports 2021-03-19 12:37:04 Unless if it‚Äôs like a wing which got shot off

bug-reports 2021-03-20 09:00:33 It happens when a bullet hits the pilot seat or some other area which causes the aircraft to basically become a flying block.
bug-reports 2021-03-20 09:00:47 The only way to fix it is to ask the person to reset or kill the person
bug-reports 2021-03-20 09:01:08 It‚Äôs not really that hard to kill the person as missiles can still see the flying aircraft even when invisible
bug-reports 2021-03-20 13:54:21 You could just swap to motor 1s for folding instead of asking for a fix
bug-reports 2021-03-20 13:54:30 And set it to lock.
bug-reports 2021-03-20 13:54:56 What it basically does is just freezes the motor so it doesn‚Äôt move until a keybind is pressed
bug-reports 2021-03-20 13:56:23 And it should reduce the lag

bug-reports 2021-04-02 12:54:55 It might be because of performance issues

bug-reports 2021-04-03 10:26:47 We did get a physic performance update and yes being hit by anything that is explosive will result in extreme lag.
bug-reports 2021-04-03 10:27:35 You can see this when you reset you‚Äôre character when you have a big build
bug-reports 2021-04-03 10:27:54 I wouldn‚Äôt recommend going to the water to pvp in big boats for now
bug-reports 2021-04-03 13:21:20 <@601416284520841227> the roblox translation system is based on Google translate. Plane Crazy has nothing to do with the roblox translation as it hasn‚Äôt been altered with.
bug-reports 2021-04-03 13:21:47 This plane crazy cannot be held accountable for this bug
bug-reports 2021-04-03 13:22:08 Because you do not have image perms
bug-reports 2021-04-03 13:22:14 This effects all channels

bug-reports 2021-04-03 13:23:07 Yes
bug-reports 2021-04-03 13:30:49 I don‚Äôt think it can be done
bug-reports 2021-04-03 13:31:08 Roblox is horrible at making decisions so most devs have to correct those decisions
bug-reports 2021-04-03 13:31:27 But rickje will most likely not be changing the translation as it takes a lot of time
bug-reports 2021-04-03 13:31:59 It might even involve rickje to start from scratch since Google translate is so rubbish

bug-reports 2021-04-26 11:57:27 It‚Äôs not even a bug at that point
bug-reports 2021-04-26 11:58:55 Possibly.
bug-reports 2021-04-26 11:59:32 As of currently hardcode is slow. So yes it‚Äôs possible that most of the bug fixes implemented into the game were not executed correctly
bug-reports 2021-04-26 11:59:58 Yes because other games are softcoded
bug-reports 2021-04-26 12:00:20 Softcoded is better for both devs and players

bug-reports 2021-04-26 15:02:01 Roblox reverted the performance update again
bug-reports 2021-04-26 15:02:12 Which will explain your bad FPS

bug-reports 2021-05-05 12:19:21 Yeah but the locking process is the problem
bug-reports 2021-05-05 12:19:29 You can‚Äôt get the lock correct the 100% of the time
bug-reports 2021-05-05 12:21:11 Check if locks are still on

bug-reports 2021-05-05 12:22:16 That effects the trails?
bug-reports 2021-05-05 12:23:11 I think doing that type of lock is based on RNG
bug-reports 2021-05-05 12:23:25 Since the locked bases can either go up or down
bug-reports 2021-05-05 12:23:29 Which effects the build

bug-reports 2021-05-06 05:43:47 It‚Äôs not major

bug-reports 2021-05-06 12:17:48 It fixed itself. 
<:WeirdChamp:670867805176070145>
bug-reports 2021-05-06 12:17:58 And you even took a screenshot of it fixing itself
bug-reports 2021-05-06 12:18:41 Roblox chunks generation differs when it comes to performance.
bug-reports 2021-05-06 12:19:05 I think on intel it loads 2-5 chunks around you
bug-reports 2021-05-06 12:19:21 On nividia it forces the GPU to load all the chunks
bug-reports 2021-05-06 12:19:40 Does it not?
bug-reports 2021-05-06 12:19:47 It seems to only effect intel users
bug-reports 2021-05-06 12:20:01 Then again I only asked 1 nividia user
bug-reports 2021-05-06 12:20:49 Maybe it is a roblox issue. But they wouldn‚Äôt leave it there for 4 months would they?
bug-reports 2021-05-06 12:21:27 But it loads around the camera
bug-reports 2021-05-06 12:21:30 Well
bug-reports 2021-05-06 12:21:31 For me
bug-reports 2021-05-06 12:22:16 Mine loads the unrendered chunks
bug-reports 2021-05-06 12:22:43 And if I fly into one of those unrendered chunks I basically have to wait for it to render because those unrendered chunks is above me
bug-reports 2021-05-06 12:23:11 It‚Äôs a feature
bug-reports 2021-05-06 12:23:16 It‚Äôs used to reduce lag
bug-reports 2021-05-06 12:23:31 But it hasn‚Äôt rescued the lag the slightest ever since it was added
bug-reports 2021-05-06 12:24:31 I don‚Äôt think they lag though
bug-reports 2021-05-06 12:24:48 Well yes water lags
bug-reports 2021-05-06 12:25:02 But land rendering doesn‚Äôt contribute to the lag
bug-reports 2021-05-06 12:26:12 Yeah
bug-reports 2021-05-06 12:26:19 Land ones are really good
bug-reports 2021-05-06 12:27:08 To be fair you can‚Äôt put voxels on water very well

bug-reports 2021-05-09 17:02:38 Plane Crazy isn‚Äôt very optimised when it comes to resolution. Sometimes texts clip out of their own text bars because the code isn‚Äôt fine tuned yet
bug-reports 2021-05-09 17:03:38 He might not be lying
bug-reports 2021-05-09 17:03:57 It is possible for creations to crash clients upon summoning a glitch
bug-reports 2021-05-09 17:04:54 However that requires a rope and possibly a motor
bug-reports 2021-05-09 17:06:08 He might have split them into 2 which is possible in ordinary circumstances through the use of a few suspension blocks and a motor. But that won‚Äôt crash his client.
bug-reports 2021-05-09 17:08:44 I have an example
bug-reports 2021-05-09 17:09:24 Be aware
bug-reports 2021-05-09 17:09:28 It crashes your client
bug-reports 2021-05-09 17:10:04 It could just be a disconnector

bug-reports 2021-05-11 16:31:10 Well?
bug-reports 2021-05-11 16:31:34 You explode because your pvp mode was on and the crash is because motorlock

bug-reports 2021-05-22 06:54:56 You are kidding me
bug-reports 2021-05-22 06:55:51 No. Opera has a different roblox installer than chrome
bug-reports 2021-05-22 06:55:58 It could even be worse

the-dump 2021-05-27 11:53:38 Yes
the-dump 2021-05-27 11:53:45 You can‚Äôt fly away this time
the-dump 2021-05-27 11:54:29

the-dump 2021-05-27 11:55:38 <:KEKW:670310537300672528>
bug-reports 2021-05-27 11:57:07 Because the development isn‚Äôt done <:empty:794431705070174238>
the-dump 2021-05-27 16:01:17 I think that‚Äôs the windows 10 loading screen
the-dump 2021-05-27 16:01:26 But why is it so informal
the-dump 2021-05-27 16:01:30 It‚Äôs not?
the-dump 2021-05-27 16:01:45 Shake it
the-dump 2021-05-27 16:02:09 I wouldn‚Äôt recommend shaking hard drives
the-dump 2021-05-27 16:02:30 Unless you want to cause destruction
the-dump 2021-05-27 16:04:57 You mean throw it in the water
the-dump 2021-05-27 16:05:07 All the time
the-dump 2021-05-27 16:05:10 Not just right now
the-dump 2021-05-27 16:05:47 
the-dump 2021-05-27 16:05:48 What
the-dump 2021-05-27 16:07:45 Wow
the-dump 2021-05-27 16:07:47 How responsible
the-dump 2021-05-27 16:11:43 That FOV
the-dump 2021-05-27 16:11:53 I play on 90
the-dump 2021-05-27 16:12:46 Yeah but
the-dump 2021-05-27 16:13:06 No 0x sight sniping
the-dump 2021-05-27 16:13:38 And it also doesn‚Äôt make you feel like your in a space ship all the time
the-dump 2021-05-27 16:13:51 Because it doesn‚Äôt make you any faster
the-dump 2021-05-27 16:14:22 But what‚Äôs the point
the-dump 2021-05-27 16:14:50 You can‚Äôt see at medium to long range distances without a non 0x sight
the-dump 2021-05-27 16:15:19 You can only spot
the-dump 2021-05-27 16:15:28 And that‚Äôs pretty much all you could do without a scope
the-dump 2021-05-27 16:15:44 Apart from close combat
the-dump 2021-05-27 16:16:47 Just do FOV:70-100 and just use like a 4x scope
the-dump 2021-05-27 16:16:55 Unless
the-dump 2021-05-27 16:16:59 Not proe
the-dump 2021-05-27 16:17:36 I use WD-40
the-dump 2021-05-27 16:18:09 My assault class is a DBV shotgun with birdshot <:trollface:775024642104229898>

the-dump 2021-05-27 16:18:27 2 hits and goned
the-dump 2021-05-27 16:18:34 Unless it‚Äôs further away
the-dump 2021-05-27 16:18:45 Mines pretty alright
the-dump 2021-05-27 16:18:59 My pf sensitivity is around 1
the-dump 2021-05-27 16:19:15 And my game sensitivity is 1.6
the-dump 2021-05-27 16:19:38 I forgor what‚Äôs my AR

the-dump 2021-05-27 16:20:23 Without the silencer
the-dump 2021-05-27 16:20:34 Because I can‚Äôt aim for shit
the-dump 2021-05-27 16:20:38 With a sniper
the-dump 2021-05-27 16:20:45 I can aim with any other gun
the-dump 2021-05-27 16:20:47 But a sniper
the-dump 2021-05-27 16:21:01 I use to have a SMG
the-dump 2021-05-27 16:21:10 A MP5 or a P90
the-dump 2021-05-27 16:21:22 But now I‚Äôm grinding colt smg
the-dump 2021-05-27 16:21:32 And I realised this funny thing
the-dump 2021-05-27 16:21:42 I play AK there
the-dump 2021-05-27 16:21:49 Not that bad at aiming
the-dump 2021-05-27 16:21:52 But not good
the-dump 2021-05-27 16:21:54 Because
the-dump 2021-05-27 16:22:02 I play at what you call
the-dump 2021-05-27 16:22:03 Nothing
the-dump 2021-05-27 16:22:11 Res is 1200x800-900
the-dump 2021-05-27 16:22:25 Idk how much I have
the-dump 2021-05-27 16:22:29 Because I don‚Äôt spend monies
the-dump 2021-05-27 16:22:52 I haven‚Äôt got that much
the-dump 2021-05-27 16:22:56 Actually
the-dump 2021-05-27 16:23:07 <@!564861679616393216> should I make the P90 **speedrun**
the-dump 2021-05-27 16:23:24 Pocket LMG

the-dump 2021-05-27 16:23:51 <:trollface:775024642104229898>
the-dump 2021-05-27 16:24:09 I have an awm as a sniper
the-dump 2021-05-27 16:24:11 Which I don‚Äôt use
the-dump 2021-05-27 16:24:18 Idk
the-dump 2021-05-27 16:24:27 The first time I got a pc
the-dump 2021-05-27 16:24:42 The first game was prob pf
the-dump 2021-05-27 16:24:47 Nah
the-dump 2021-05-27 16:25:00 Ever heard of shoulder shooting <:FineTroll:626841259746656289>
the-dump 2021-05-27 16:25:15 I rather not
the-dump 2021-05-27 16:25:25 It‚Äôs not manageable
the-dump 2021-05-27 16:25:29 But not impossible
the-dump 2021-05-27 16:25:31 Because
the-dump 2021-05-27 16:25:45 P90 is actually loaded with armour piercing rounds from the factory
the-dump 2021-05-27 16:25:47 <:trollface:775024642104229898>
the-dump 2021-05-27 16:25:55 And that seems to hold true with pf
bug-reports 2021-05-27 16:28:01 Currently the only solution is
Restart wifi (router) and computer
the-dump 2021-05-27 16:28:48 More gunpowder in the Cartridge?

the-dump 2021-05-27 16:31:53 And minisight
the-dump 2021-05-27 16:33:54 Tec9 because fast rpm
the-dump 2021-05-27 16:34:04 Not so bad of a recoil
the-dump 2021-05-27 16:34:51 Cool
the-dump 2021-05-27 16:34:56 I don‚Äôt have the best guns
the-dump 2021-05-27 16:35:06 But I have a good tactic
the-dump 2021-05-27 16:35:11 For DBV
the-dump 2021-05-27 16:35:22 If DBV runs out of ammo just shoot tec 9
the-dump 2021-05-27 16:35:24 Because
the-dump 2021-05-27 16:35:27 Fast RPM
the-dump 2021-05-27 16:35:32 Looks like an MG
the-dump 2021-05-27 16:35:44 And kills
the-dump 2021-05-27 16:35:48 While sounding good
the-dump 2021-05-27 16:36:48 But you can‚Äôt use both guns at the same time
the-dump 2021-05-27 16:36:49 And
the-dump 2021-05-27 16:37:09 Chances are someone would harness the power of god
the-dump 2021-05-27 16:37:17 Because your blind

bug-reports 2021-05-28 15:45:27 Because that‚Äôs how the bug happens
bug-reports 2021-05-28 15:45:35 At that point it‚Äôs not even a bug
bug-reports 2021-05-28 15:45:40 It‚Äôs just human incompetence

bug-reports 2021-06-10 17:40:37 If so try shutting it down and turning it back on again
bug-reports 2021-06-10 17:40:46 I feel like it might be an update issue
bug-reports 2021-06-10 17:43:20 Ask him to restart the server
bug-reports 2021-06-10 17:43:35 And while he is at it check if it only happens in his server
bug-reports 2021-06-10 17:48:16 Try to see if you phase through the map on public servers though
bug-reports 2021-06-11 05:31:45 Yes you don‚Äôt need to be another thanos

bug-reports 2021-06-11 08:59:08 I have a feeling that roblox servers are being overloaded
bug-reports 2021-06-11 08:59:34 The chat being slow might be because of a problem in the servers connection
bug-reports 2021-06-11 08:59:56 The random freezing is normal for me
bug-reports 2021-06-11 09:00:04 Since potato pc

bug-reports 2021-06-11 09:01:28 They will have to upgrade servers in Europe, Japan, US, Russia
bug-reports 2021-06-11 09:01:33 Quite a lot of places
bug-reports 2021-06-11 09:04:55 So it turns out roblox does do upgrades to their servers

the-dump 2021-06-14 17:48:59 I think it‚Äôs just a ball

bug-reports 2021-06-14 18:09:44 Also the deletion of some words is the result of the limitations of the sign

bug-reports 2021-06-16 08:03:57 There‚Äôs nothing much we could do though
bug-reports 2021-06-16 08:04:09 All we can do is wait until softcode is released
bug-reports 2021-06-16 08:05:55 Missiles can still track the target
bug-reports 2021-06-16 08:06:15 And you will be able to see a flying part of the build
bug-reports 2021-06-16 08:06:24 And you can aim at it with some skill and a bit of luck
bug-reports 2021-06-16 08:07:05 Just ignore it

bug-reports 2021-06-16 08:09:24 The opposite direction of where the build is
bug-reports 2021-06-16 08:10:16 And if it‚Äôs really annoying just stop using guns that aren‚Äôt stacked on each other
bug-reports 2021-06-16 08:10:39 He can‚Äôt not until he finishes softcode
bug-reports 2021-06-16 08:11:08 At the moment plane Crazy is hardcoded and whatever changes he makes will break something in the game
bug-reports 2021-06-16 08:11:14 Btw
bug-reports 2021-06-16 08:11:28 That invis missile bug can be fixed by resetting the computer and the wifi

bug-reports 2021-06-25 05:24:34 Check your slowmode. It‚Äôs prob turning on
bug-reports 2021-06-25 05:24:55 or a delayed firing
bug-reports 2021-06-25 05:26:09 Prob lag
bug-reports 2021-06-25 05:27:23 The only way for you to drop them is to slow down
bug-reports 2021-06-25 05:27:43 since the bomb flies backwards when you release the bomb
bug-reports 2021-06-25 05:28:17 Or you could try to make missiles or big bombs
bug-reports 2021-06-25 05:28:21 <@!466673912760107009>
bug-reports 2021-06-25 05:29:25 or make the bombs at the rear of the bomb bay longer
bug-reports 2021-06-25 05:30:14 Which means merging the bombs on the rear to the bombs infront of the last bomb
bug-reports 2021-06-25 15:25:27 I don‚Äôt think rickje can fix this without having the entire game be rewritten as it‚Äôs a problem with hit registration or part linkage. It broke when roblox updated some months ago. Mind you at this point it isn‚Äôt even a serious problem.

bug-reports 2021-07-01 16:06:22 It‚Äôs caused because of lag. Or basically the thing is too slow but the server sees it going too fast.
bug-reports 2021-07-01 16:08:49 You could just move your build to refresh those invisible blocks
bug-reports 2021-07-01 16:08:59 and make them non existent
bug-reports 2021-07-01 16:10:30 then just reload the build after saving it
bug-reports 2021-07-01 16:10:45 and it wouldn‚Äôt be laggy to move a build anywhere
bug-reports 2021-07-01 16:11:17 Just the build moving very slowly because of the processing that is required

bug-reports 2021-07-24 03:43:21 <@!715148402022678608> we could consider the ticket option which would go through people with ranks above a certain level. Through there maybe we would either DM rickje or still have bug reports open but only to ranks above that certain level.

bug-reports 2021-08-13 16:42:30 It doesn‚Äôt have to be
bug-reports 2021-08-13 16:44:09 the number of blocks used in a save slot, paint, the way it‚Äôs compressed, how complex it is and maybe even where you save it could change the numbers slowly or dramatically
bug-reports 2021-08-13 16:44:22 the game doesn‚Äôt count the number of save slots used

bug-reports 2021-08-14 16:46:49 It‚Äôs normal
bug-reports 2021-08-14 16:46:57 it‚Äôs just some hitbox breaking
bug-reports 2021-08-14 16:47:05 it happens for all blocks
bug-reports 2021-08-14 16:47:13 including wedge 1x4
bug-reports 2021-08-14 16:47:24 The good thing is that you can break the plot

bug-reports 2021-08-14 16:48:37 it wobbles?

bug-reports 2021-08-14 16:49:07 yeah that
bug-reports 2021-08-14 16:49:11 I haven‚Äôt found the cause of it
bug-reports 2021-08-14 16:49:19 Seems to be random and really annoying
bug-reports 2021-08-14 16:49:29 it normally happens to me whenever I use a piston
bug-reports 2021-08-14 16:50:26 There is as of right now no fix
bug-reports 2021-08-14 16:50:51 but at the moment you could try to remove the piston holding the turret up if you have any.

bug-reports 2021-08-15 04:42:44 Tbh I feel like corrupted save files are now a lot more serious. Some save files when loaded in don‚Äôt load in completely. You can just reload the save file and have your build back.
bug-reports 2021-08-15 04:42:58 please don‚Äôt save it because it will save the corrupted file
creations-chat 2021-08-15 05:01:27 You‚Äôve never seen a sunrise before have you
creations-chat 2021-08-15 05:03:37 Because it‚Äôs not real <:empty:794431705070174238> 
It‚Äôs made by a guy from his drawings and brought into plane crazy.
Admittedly your builds look cool but I haven‚Äôt seen any of them on <#384025409945337856>
creations-chat 2021-08-15 05:06:01 Again it‚Äôs a drawing on a piece of paper by the creator. Brought into plane crazy. It isn‚Äôt suppose to be any plane.

You can see why we like these kinds of builds when you see the absolute mayhem that is <#384025409945337856>
creations-chat 2021-08-15 05:08:21 If you compare that to this <@!869034105625534474> which one would you prefer most.

That‚Äôs the main reason we like that jet. It‚Äôs cool, it isn‚Äôt real and it look a lot more better than whatever this is
creations-chat 2021-08-15 05:10:30 But the point is that we upvote good builds because we don‚Äôt see them very often since they take a while to make and refine.

the-dump 2021-08-22 15:55:29 I guess it‚Äôs about 8
the-dump 2021-08-22 15:55:52 but I can‚Äôt get accurate readings because for some reason It says I have 4 GBs of ram in task manager
the-dump 2021-08-22 15:56:11 And 2 in use for igpu
the-dump 2021-08-22 15:56:26 if I add them together 2 are missing or I have only 2 available
the-dump 2021-08-22 15:56:51 it‚Äôs not reaction times
the-dump 2021-08-22 15:56:57 It‚Äôs just fps
the-dump 2021-08-22 15:57:00 you see it faster
the-dump 2021-08-22 15:57:09 you see stuff faster
the-dump 2021-08-22 15:57:17 your reaction time doesn‚Äôt change
the-dump 2021-08-22 15:58:25 I get 60 fps on graphics 7
the-dump 2021-08-22 15:58:31 for plane Crazy
the-dump 2021-08-22 15:58:41 8 if I really want the quality
the-dump 2021-08-22 15:58:47 10 is possible but only for screenshots
the-dump 2021-08-22 15:58:51 1-3 for videos
the-dump 2021-08-22 16:00:08 you should see how graphics 2 and no global shadows actually helps
the-dump 2021-08-22 16:00:11 It‚Äôs like wt
the-dump 2021-08-22 16:00:19 you see sunlight through fucking walls
the-dump 2021-08-22 16:00:42 Both give the same results

the-dump 2021-08-22 16:01:12 Graphics 2 render distance is still quite decent
the-dump 2021-08-22 16:01:15 Even for metro
the-dump 2021-08-22 16:01:28 the outside section of prison.
the-dump 2021-08-22 16:01:36 the crane map
the-dump 2021-08-22 16:01:49 actually multiple crane maps
the-dump 2021-08-22 16:02:02 and most other long range maps
the-dump 2021-08-22 16:02:17 lmao you can see the entire map with graphics 2
the-dump 2021-08-22 16:02:30 Unless your in a corner and the sniper is in another corner
the-dump 2021-08-22 16:02:33 also
the-dump 2021-08-22 16:02:38 A peel about using graphics 2
the-dump 2021-08-22 16:02:46 you render players before you render cranes
the-dump 2021-08-22 16:02:52 So basically legal wall hacks
the-dump 2021-08-22 16:04:51 on the map mall graphics 2 actually help a lot
the-dump 2021-08-22 16:05:04 since you render the players first before rendering the crane
the-dump 2021-08-22 16:05:26 Yet you can still render the players on the roof top
the-dump 2021-08-22 16:06:26 I don‚Äôt understand

bug-reports 2021-08-23 02:26:58 yeah if codes aren‚Äôt executed properly and finished properly you will basically be softlocked. That‚Äôs basically how bad of a state plane crazy is in right now.
bug-reports 2021-08-23 06:50:20 you did that to someone once?

bug-reports 2021-08-23 09:57:02 are you Lester?
bug-reports 2021-08-23 12:53:47 For some reason that bug ties to performance.
bug-reports 2021-08-23 12:54:18 So if you are playing on a chromebook and getting about 15 fps you will basically constantly fly away
bug-reports 2021-08-23 12:54:26 it‚Äôs kind of performance issues
bug-reports 2021-08-23 12:55:08 he‚Äôs saying the camera doesn‚Äôt rotate properly while using camera lock.
bug-reports 2021-08-23 12:55:43 yeah.
bug-reports 2021-08-23 12:55:45 I tried
bug-reports 2021-08-23 12:56:03 my laptop is sort of mid ranged but eats shit when rendering particles making it Low end
bug-reports 2021-08-23 12:56:50 I play it at 1366x700
bug-reports 2021-08-23 12:56:54 or 600
bug-reports 2021-08-23 12:57:04 and I still get constant freezes from time to time.
bug-reports 2021-08-23 12:57:13 but anyway
bug-reports 2021-08-23 12:57:21 I tested it in a public server
bug-reports 2021-08-23 12:57:32 which is laggier than a private server when empty.
bug-reports 2021-08-23 12:57:50 because you don‚Äôt need to render blocks
bug-reports 2021-08-23 12:58:08 so it‚Äôs easier for the PC on the private server.
bug-reports 2021-08-23 12:58:25 and yes GPU does play a part here.
bug-reports 2021-08-23 13:26:20 Using a motor and a camera, camera locking can occur. 
Camera locking is more powering in terms of motorlocking because folds are not needed. However cameras are just really buggy.
If you put a motor on top of a camera and aim the camera at an object, you will see it twists the motor to whichever direction you pointed the camera at. (Including upward and downward angles)
bug-reports 2021-08-23 13:31:11 Camera locking works best with non 90, 0 or 180 angles ( I think).
bug-reports 2021-08-23 13:32:31 camera angles of used in the wrong way, can basically cause some snappy effects to happen as you spawn.
bug-reports 2021-08-23 13:32:51 the last time I used it the camera lock was not the same as it use to be.
bug-reports 2021-08-23 14:20:50 What
bug-reports 2021-08-23 14:21:55 this inverts the users seat position
bug-reports 2021-08-23 14:22:10 Aimed backwards
bug-reports 2021-08-23 14:45:53 yes
bug-reports 2021-08-23 15:54:04 I think you‚Äôre missing a motor
bug-reports 2021-08-23 15:54:17 camera reconfigured alone doesn‚Äôt do anything without a motor
bug-reports 2021-08-23 15:54:25 except flips the build around
bug-reports 2021-08-23 15:55:49 cameras connected together and pointed in the same angle prob equals out the force
bug-reports 2021-08-23 15:56:00 <@849417848740642826> has your build ever worked once
the-dump 2021-08-23 16:03:38 Wow stolen
creations-chat 2021-08-23 16:25:18 Maybe it‚Äôs because of exposed motorlock, default landing gear and maybe default colours

bug-reports 2021-08-29 04:22:54 if you refuse don‚Äôt complain about it. Cool?
bug-reports 2021-08-29 04:23:36 I would suggest re-saving most of your builds just in case these types of things happens again.
bug-reports 2021-08-29 04:23:57 this shouldn‚Äôt happen but this will inevitably happen
bug-reports 2021-08-29 04:24:33 plane Crazy is still in its beta stage and the current coding methods are mess so for every roblox update it receives it causes the game to bug out more.
bug-reports 2021-08-29 04:25:36 Odd
bug-reports 2021-08-29 04:27:14 It usually happens when motor 2s just spaz out and separate from the aircraft. Usually this will cause the motor 2 to fly away from the aircraft on its own. But after that it will attempt to return to the aircraft. So yes it‚Äôs kind of normal if you know what‚Äôs wrong.

bug-reports 2021-08-29 14:40:49 can you post a link to a video of sorts?

bug-reports 2021-08-29 16:36:33 odd
bug-reports 2021-08-29 16:36:46 no
bug-reports 2021-08-29 16:37:10 but I think control c and v utilise the copy and paste used in the computer
bug-reports 2021-08-29 16:37:22 but crashes like this have been reported before
bug-reports 2021-08-29 16:37:32 just that there isn‚Äôt a fix for it
bug-reports 2021-08-29 16:37:46 I feel like it‚Äôs a roblox bug
bug-reports 2021-08-29 16:38:10 So for now just try to adapt to the 1st tools configuration tool
bug-reports 2021-08-29 23:15:07 you will have to reset both the device and router to fix the issue
bug-reports 2021-08-29 23:15:41 Rejoin. Lag issue caused code to be insufficiently executed
bug-reports 2021-08-29 23:18:23 Please note or attempt to remember if you saved your build or not. understandably corruption is an issue but double saving could help.
bug-reports 2021-08-29 23:20:47 also I think through the finds like magnet engines, hover engines, conveyor engines and rope engines tends to make the game ever increasingly unstable.
Travelling fast is a good thing but I‚Äôm not sure if roblox servers can handle the speed.

the-dump 2021-09-02 03:00:34 when in truth
the-dump 2021-09-02 03:00:38 he called it a dying game
the-dump 2021-09-02 03:00:47 Because he can‚Äôt think of anymore bots to build

the person you banned
Plane Crazy isn‚Äôt completely dead. It‚Äôs player base fluctuates according to the timezones. 4K in Asia 7.3K in the US. However shredder bugs have been plaguing the game even until now and the community and most of everyone outside of PCC has a hatred for them. The number of people have been declining over the months because of the content. Not the game being dead (2K is it‚Äôs minimum) the content posted here ranges from reviewing aircraft to shredder bugs. The aircraft reviews are fine however there is only so many aircraft and players to builds them that you eventually run out of content but that isn‚Äôt the main issue when it comes to plane crazy content. Plane Crazy has gotten out of favour from shredder bugs to using tutorial planes or the plane crazy tutorial plane and from the time you joined the plane crazy scene, shredder bugs were dying. Normally shredder bugs are classed by these few characteristics
> extreme turning rates 
> slow speeds (600 sps)
> usage of the cutter
> is small and hard to hit compared to larger aircraft
my suggestion is to make your own builds. Make them look good, pvp them with your community or maybe recreate videos in plane crazy.
Also a sequel to plane crazy is about 75% complete as I type this.

the-dump 2021-09-03 12:27:49 You only have yourself to blame
the-dump 2021-09-03 12:27:59 maybe deleting could‚Äôve helped
the-dump 2021-09-03 12:28:41 couldn‚Äôt you have tested the filter first before trying your stupidity?
the-dump 2021-09-03 12:28:47 or ask
the-dump 2021-09-03 12:29:06 like
the-dump 2021-09-03 12:29:12 you can test it ask many times as you like
the-dump 2021-09-03 12:29:21 and you won‚Äôt get warned by a mod
the-dump 2021-09-03 12:29:35 no where
the-dump 2021-09-03 12:29:53 Kind of. But seeing that you are in a roblox community, expect that
the-dump 2021-09-03 12:30:17 Very true

the-dump 2021-09-03 12:31:44 most of those servers don‚Äôt necessarily TOS
the-dump 2021-09-03 12:32:03 this server
the-dump 2021-09-03 12:32:10 Really follows tos
the-dump 2021-09-03 12:32:13 Very strictly
the-dump 2021-09-03 12:32:56 you watched a child get kidnapped
the-dump 2021-09-03 12:33:27 Sam
the-dump 2021-09-03 12:34:01 I wouldn‚Äôt
the-dump 2021-09-03 12:34:19 no
the-dump 2021-09-03 12:34:34 There isn‚Äôt much of any point other than starting an argument
the-dump 2021-09-03 12:34:43 Yeah obc did the funny

the-dump 2021-09-03 12:35:55 fuck
the-dump 2021-09-03 12:36:22 You can‚Äôt say the filtered words so there wouldn‚Äôt be any point
the-dump 2021-09-03 12:36:52 actually that‚Äôs mostly the reason why mods didn‚Äôt say it in the rules
the-dump 2021-09-03 12:37:08 because they will be bypassing the rules they themselves set

the-dump 2021-09-03 12:42:18 you can get banned for a Japanese red sun that has I think 50+ lines
the-dump 2021-09-03 12:42:26 But you can‚Äôt get banned for something that is 40+
the-dump 2021-09-03 12:42:45 idk
the-dump 2021-09-03 12:42:56 but the rule exists in Forza horizon server
the-dump 2021-09-03 12:43:16 you can have a Japanese imperial flag with 54 stripes but not 56

the-dump 2021-09-03 12:46:19 you sent
the-dump 2021-09-03 12:47:15 it‚Äôs rain blanket

the-dump 2021-09-03 12:47:36 can it protect the man against flash floods <:trollface:775024642104229898>
the-dump 2021-09-03 12:47:58 maybe not
the-dump 2021-09-03 12:48:06 flash floods catch‚Äôs debris
the-dump 2021-09-03 12:48:10 like manhole covers
the-dump 2021-09-03 12:48:14 Trees

the-dump 2021-09-03 12:48:52 Floating with the cars
bug-reports 2021-09-03 16:44:25 A jet engine
bug-reports 2021-09-03 16:45:17 with high pressure, Low pressure, fan and exhaust chambers
bug-reports 2021-09-03 16:45:56 what he‚Äôs currently making should be the engine cowling
bug-reports 2021-09-04 08:40:11 I feel like there‚Äôs just too many locks happening at once
bug-reports 2021-09-04 08:40:38 maybe try to stage the explosives to lock at different times. Like one for the engine and the other for the cowling
bug-reports 2021-09-04 08:44:37 My theory is that when motorlocking code is executed at the same time lag will happen this would prob make the code not run properly thus not motorlocking.
bug-reports 2021-09-04 08:45:41 yeah it usually effect larger builds
bug-reports 2021-09-04 08:45:49 like 2-4K size
bug-reports 2021-09-04 08:46:03 quite annoying for big boat builders
bug-reports 2021-09-04 08:46:25 it‚Äôs not very serious since it doesn‚Äôt effect everyone
bug-reports 2021-09-04 08:46:39 did you save it again
bug-reports 2021-09-04 08:46:50 and it still said 0 blocks
bug-reports 2021-09-04 08:47:06 yes
bug-reports 2021-09-04 08:47:29 huh.
bug-reports 2021-09-04 08:47:42 How much is your ping
bug-reports 2021-09-04 08:48:32 yeah but it‚Äôs quite odd
bug-reports 2021-09-04 08:48:38 you can try to save it in another free slot
bug-reports 2021-09-04 08:48:41 like autosave
bug-reports 2021-09-04 08:48:45 if it still says 0
bug-reports 2021-09-04 08:48:58 then it couldn‚Äôt prob be the game thinking that it doesn‚Äôt exist
bug-reports 2021-09-04 08:49:40 I guess you have no choice but to rejoin then.
bug-reports 2021-09-04 08:49:53 I know
bug-reports 2021-09-04 08:50:04 I can‚Äôt fix the bug

the-dump 2021-09-06 16:11:37 https://youtu.be/rvyhKmfbtx0
the-dump 2021-09-06 16:11:43 quite literally a meme itself
bug-reports 2021-09-06 16:21:19 odd.
bug-reports 2021-09-06 16:21:47 It could be a infinite yield that happens instantly
bug-reports 2021-09-06 16:21:59 because from what I know
bug-reports 2021-09-06 16:22:11 there is a game breaking bug in all games
bug-reports 2021-09-06 16:22:34 As Long as you can go there fast enough and as far from the center of the game, your game will crash
bug-reports 2021-09-06 16:22:40 instantly
bug-reports 2021-09-06 16:23:29 but pistons are different since they only have 6 possible sides to have a collision on by itself.
bug-reports 2021-09-06 16:23:38 wait
bug-reports 2021-09-06 16:25:42 
bug-reports 2021-09-06 16:25:44 Found it.
bug-reports 2021-09-06 16:26:09 I did the experiment on mobile because I was at grandmothers house
bug-reports 2021-09-06 16:26:13 which didn‚Äôt have a computer
bug-reports 2021-09-06 16:26:15 so deal with it
bug-reports 2021-09-06 16:26:22 Anyway
bug-reports 2021-09-06 16:27:26 I think the crash is caused when the piston head is thrusted further than the game will allow or basically a infinite yield
bug-reports 2021-09-06 16:30:54 crash after being destroyed? Or after being hit by a bullet
bug-reports 2021-09-06 16:31:45 so basically the old bug
bug-reports 2021-09-06 16:32:35 Dev console?
bug-reports 2021-09-06 16:32:40 or is there prob nothing
bug-reports 2021-09-06 16:33:57 Computer??

bug-reports 2021-09-09 01:11:31 I thought you use motor 2 for tank turrets
bug-reports 2021-09-09 01:12:18 but it doesn‚Äôt effect wheels
bug-reports 2021-09-09 01:12:36 It doesn‚Äôt
bug-reports 2021-09-09 01:13:08 The bug only effects the motor when there is a side of the motor that is very heavy
bug-reports 2021-09-09 01:13:27 like you trying to open a door very close to one of the hinges
bug-reports 2021-09-09 01:14:09 it‚Äôs random.
bug-reports 2021-09-09 01:14:43 also. I don‚Äôt think this bug happens on motor 1
bug-reports 2021-09-09 01:15:04 you won‚Äôt
bug-reports 2021-09-09 01:15:11 the motor 1s code is quite basic
bug-reports 2021-09-09 01:15:53 and the motor 2 usually dies because it‚Äôs just a clone of motor 1 and limited to specific angles
bug-reports 2021-09-09 01:16:22 and and goal of the motor 2 is to just point towards a specific angle
bug-reports 2021-09-09 01:16:25 Whichever way
bug-reports 2021-09-09 01:16:47 So it takes the shorter way which basically just send it the wrong way for you

the-dump 2021-09-09 11:00:56 yeah lmao
the-dump 2021-09-09 11:01:05 the best tactic to defeat shredder bugs
the-dump 2021-09-09 11:01:14 is to just make a B-17
the-dump 2021-09-09 11:01:22 strap a lot of guns onto it
the-dump 2021-09-09 11:01:28 and aim at the center
the-dump 2021-09-09 11:01:52 How was it laggy
the-dump 2021-09-09 11:02:05 it‚Äôs just a stream of pee
the-dump 2021-09-09 11:02:10 and your saying it‚Äôs laggy?
the-dump 2021-09-09 11:02:17 Makes sense
the-dump 2021-09-09 11:02:55 Not really
the-dump 2021-09-09 11:03:07 why is it bad
the-dump 2021-09-09 11:03:33 Speed 5
the-dump 2021-09-09 11:03:47 and you basically accelerate slower than speed 60
the-dump 2021-09-09 11:04:12 Rotating clock system that changes the conveyor speed by spinning them onto the the surface
the-dump 2021-09-09 11:04:14 <:thoink:657279634563399720>
the-dump 2021-09-09 11:04:44 It‚Äôs just a motor put on reset
the-dump 2021-09-09 11:05:11 and turns whenever you press the button and release when you want to stay at the speed you are going
the-dump 2021-09-09 11:05:23 not really
the-dump 2021-09-09 11:05:38 you can dodge shredder and call them noobed
the-dump 2021-09-09 11:05:43 then proceed to fly away <:KEKW:670310537300672528>
the-dump 2021-09-09 11:06:03 yeah but flying faster than them humiliates them
the-dump 2021-09-09 11:06:10 And generally makes the player angry
the-dump 2021-09-09 11:06:16 which makes it more funny
the-dump 2021-09-09 11:06:23 They can
the-dump 2021-09-09 11:06:32 just shoot out the motors of shredder bugs
the-dump 2021-09-09 11:06:39 And you basically have easy kills

bug-reports 2021-09-11 17:30:20 there has only been 1 way to fix it

bug-reports 2021-09-18 11:52:47 Somewhere around 2K
bug-reports 2021-09-18 11:53:09 best to double save since datastores are for some reason fragile at the moment.

bug-reports 2021-09-19 04:25:27 If you lag while rendering the map I would suggest either putting the graphics settings to automatic or lower the graphics settings
bug-reports 2021-09-19 04:25:49 roblox doesn‚Äôt have a togglable shadows option so it‚Äôs kind of painful <:empty:794431705070174238>

bug-reports 2021-09-20 14:09:05 Yeah I think that‚Äôs what he‚Äôs trying to say
bug-reports 2021-09-20 14:42:19 No damage rockets?
bug-reports 2021-09-20 14:42:31 like what cursor guided missiles or missiles given by the game
bug-reports 2021-09-20 14:44:55 I don‚Äôt remember those missiles doing that
bug-reports 2021-09-20 14:45:17 it‚Äôs either the parts of the plane detaching from the rest of the plane itself
bug-reports 2021-09-20 14:45:27 Or just total collapse of the plane
bug-reports 2021-09-20 14:45:37 there hasn‚Äôt been any reports of missiles not doing damage
bug-reports 2021-09-20 14:46:08 idk
bug-reports 2021-09-20 14:46:22 It could be because you are in a vip server
bug-reports 2021-09-20 14:46:36 And your pvp is on but the enemy‚Äôs pvp is off
bug-reports 2021-09-20 14:46:53 non pvp or pvp

bug-reports 2021-09-20 22:40:40 I‚Äôm not even sure if baseplate can do that
bug-reports 2021-09-20 22:40:58 Afterall baseplate is just a flat surface stretched
bug-reports 2021-09-21 03:14:32 Donator or supporter
bug-reports 2021-09-21 05:30:45 Rickje has a anti lag machine system
bug-reports 2021-09-21 05:31:10 Usually
bug-reports 2021-09-21 05:31:29 The system counts the number of rockets in use.
bug-reports 2021-09-21 05:31:40 Too many and your build will be invalidated to launch

bug-reports 2021-09-22 15:15:06 It‚Äôs a ‚Äúwhitelist‚Äù bug
bug-reports 2021-09-22 15:15:19 shitty bug that makes you merge plots with another person
bug-reports 2021-09-22 22:33:05 Have you considered not using ballest tanks as your main form of grass <:empty:794431705070174238>
bug-reports 2021-09-22 22:41:18 What are the chances he‚Äôs not a furry
bug-reports 2021-09-23 03:19:58 Isn‚Äôt your grass made out of ballests
bug-reports 2021-09-23 03:20:48 When you spawn on the rail, the game give you a visualisation of the rail. You aren‚Äôt suppose to go past it by much.
bug-reports 2021-09-23 03:21:30 So what are the things under your house made out of
bug-reports 2021-09-23 03:21:56 then why are some of them
bug-reports 2021-09-23 03:22:03 Painted the colour of the ballest blocks
bug-reports 2021-09-23 04:01:29 That will be fine
bug-reports 2021-09-23 04:02:38 Add helium
bug-reports 2021-09-23 05:54:09 reset or rejoin
bug-reports 2021-09-23 05:54:27 Maybe because of performance?
bug-reports 2021-09-23 22:51:20 Would you rather A get stuck because of your own incompetence or B get stuck because if your own  incompetence
bug-reports 2021-09-23 22:54:32 Rickje can‚Äôt fix the problem because of hardcode
bug-reports 2021-09-23 22:54:37 Do you not understand?
bug-reports 2021-09-23 22:55:09 And afterall it was your idea on making that huge train
bug-reports 2021-09-23 22:55:20 so you should already knew the risks in doing so
bug-reports 2021-09-23 23:01:57 Also it could take hours. Motor 1 alone has around 5K lines of code
bug-reports 2021-09-23 23:03:32 Wait for it to turn day then switch the day and night cycle to day.
bug-reports 2021-09-23 23:04:24 the black thing is actually for sunset to night
bug-reports 2021-09-23 23:17:46 If he shortens it what about people using the train station
bug-reports 2021-09-23 23:18:28 nobody in this server uses it
bug-reports 2021-09-23 23:18:32 it‚Äôs a pretty big difference
bug-reports 2021-09-23 23:19:28 the Gap between some trains and the station is quite wide
bug-reports 2021-09-23 23:19:31 currently
bug-reports 2021-09-23 23:19:42 so shortening it will just make it worse
bug-reports 2021-09-23 23:23:07 Why not just make the train narrower
bug-reports 2021-09-23 23:24:22 why don‚Äôt you
bug-reports 2021-09-23 23:24:23 just
bug-reports 2021-09-23 23:24:24 cope
bug-reports 2021-09-23 23:25:00 you are complaining about a train spawning section that isn‚Äôt bugging out because your train got stuck in the station
bug-reports 2021-09-23 23:25:25 it isn‚Äôt a bug! 
It‚Äôs just poorly planned not well executed spawning
bug-reports 2021-09-23 23:25:37 it isn‚Äôt!
bug-reports 2021-09-23 23:25:46 The game is doing what it needs to do
bug-reports 2021-09-23 23:26:10 it doesn‚Äôt check if you are a fat fuck or a thin shit
bug-reports 2021-09-23 23:27:07 open dev console
bug-reports 2021-09-23 23:27:14 see if anything failed relating to spawning
bug-reports 2021-09-23 23:28:20 so what‚Äôs your point
bug-reports 2021-09-23 23:28:27 you are going to spam ping rickje?
bug-reports 2021-09-23 23:28:37 WHAT CAN HE FUCKING DO TO FUCKING FIX IT
bug-reports 2021-09-23 23:28:42 IM LOSING MY FUCKING MIND
bug-reports 2021-09-23 23:29:04 HE ONLY DOESNT FUCKING STUDIO WHEN HE NEEDS TO
bug-reports 2021-09-23 23:29:10 HE DOESNT DO FUCKINF DESIGNING
bug-reports 2021-09-23 23:29:16 AAAAA
bug-reports 2021-09-23 23:30:07 but that will make the gap wider on the train station to models that are to scale
bug-reports 2021-09-23 23:30:58 That won‚Äôt make a **FUCKING** DIFFERENCE
bug-reports 2021-09-23 23:31:23 yeah fuck it
bug-reports 2021-09-23 23:31:25 I‚Äôm done with this
bug-reports 2021-09-23 23:31:51 shut the fuck up
bug-reports 2021-09-23 23:32:35 I can‚Äôt fucking comprehend why you think you spawning in the fucking train station is a bug
bug-reports 2021-09-23 23:33:06 THEN WHY NOT JUST FUCKING RESPAWN
bug-reports 2021-09-23 23:33:10 IS IT THAT FUCKING HARD
bug-reports 2021-09-23 23:33:19 **IS IT**
bug-reports 2021-09-23 23:34:09 **ITS FUCKING RANDOM**
bug-reports 2021-09-23 23:34:46 **YOURE NOT GETTING A FUCKING SHIT UNTIL PC2
bug-reports 2021-09-23 23:37:33 they are big enough because they are planes!
bug-reports 2021-09-23 23:37:47 The runway usually fits planes that fit the plot
bug-reports 2021-09-23 23:37:51 Those that fold barely fit
bug-reports 2021-09-23 23:51:31 But you have to angle them **correctly** and pray that you spawn correctly
bug-reports 2021-09-24 04:29:56 Current physics is based on Roblox physics but modified to suit the wing panels
bug-reports 2021-09-25 06:13:17 yeah that happens
bug-reports 2021-09-26 03:14:18 This is also happening with 3x3 textboxes. Thats why Rickje is focusing so much on PC2 since I think at this point PC1 has fallen into a state of cancer
bug-reports 2021-09-26 03:15:07 I don‚Äôt understand.
bug-reports 2021-09-26 03:15:52 It kicks because of major amounts of lag.

bot-central 2021-09-26 23:14:56 huh
bug-reports 2021-09-27 13:58:35 They won‚Äôt be fixing that anytime soon
bug-reports 2021-09-27 13:59:06 Also if you are using motor 2s to fold your builds
bug-reports 2021-09-27 13:59:09 you‚Äôre weird
bug-reports 2021-09-27 15:10:48 Use a motor one
bug-reports 2021-09-27 15:10:54 easy fix
bug-reports 2021-09-27 15:11:04 or just use motor 1 assisted motor 2
bug-reports 2021-09-27 15:11:26 since motor 2 is just the motor 1 with reset on but with varying degrees of angles.
bug-reports 2021-09-27 15:11:50 at 180 degrees they behave a bit wonky
bug-reports 2021-09-27 15:11:58 basically
bug-reports 2021-09-27 15:12:37 360,270,180,90,0 are not recommended to be used.
bug-reports 2021-09-27 23:29:26 save failure prob.
bug-reports 2021-09-27 23:29:48 Either that or signs just don‚Äôt save prob
bug-reports 2021-09-28 08:20:06 Maybe you require other people to let off some server load for you?
bug-reports 2021-09-28 08:23:25 It‚Äôs a roblox thing it doesn‚Äôt render water, particles, decals and other windows.
bug-reports 2021-09-28 08:23:36 it‚Äôs not necessarily a bug on our part
bug-reports 2021-09-28 08:45:05 Try not to use them on lower end devices
bug-reports 2021-09-28 08:45:25 If so then I think it should be fixed by PC2
bug-reports 2021-09-28 09:00:49 0
bug-reports 2021-09-28 09:01:01 since at that point lava spitters aren‚Äôt really worth it anymore
bug-reports 2021-09-28 09:01:14 exactly
bug-reports 2021-09-28 09:01:31 just please
bug-reports 2021-09-28 09:01:36 Don‚Äôt use lava spitters
bug-reports 2021-09-28 09:01:42 unless if you have a PC
bug-reports 2021-09-28 09:01:56 Because lag is inevitable on mobile and lower end PCs

bug-reports 2021-10-01 11:29:36 False. The best of developers can usually leave one or two bugs behind due to variable they do not control. Like download times, loading times, leaving times, ping issues, wifi issues, slow PC, fast PC, roblox, spilling salt water all over your PC, motorlocks not working, Yadi yadi yada you get the point.
bug-reports 2021-10-01 11:31:13 I‚Äôve placed fast PC into this because faster PCs can push out more frames per second. Some objects could be tied to FPS to make it smooth however 240 FPS pcs will basically just fly past this.

bug-reports 2021-10-05 02:16:15 infact rickje had the same but as you. Rockets disappearing upon firing but when he came back the bug was gone. I can only assume it‚Äôs a bug from roblox and the way it starts up the client.

bug-reports 2021-10-05 14:41:18 it something like that
bug-reports 2021-10-05 14:41:39 I presume it‚Äôs a bug and the way it rounds off stuff
bug-reports 2021-10-06 02:16:04 Motor 2 underwater = fling

bug-reports 2021-10-06 02:19:11 It‚Äôs pretty much like this.
You deploy parachute.
Parachute starts producing a lot of drag.
You pull parachute down.
Roblox does the funny and makes the parachute go faster than you.
Cycle repeats itself as you pull the parachute down.
bug-reports 2021-10-06 02:19:33 The simple fix is to just not use the parachute
bug-reports 2021-10-06 02:19:50 the parachute block works because it‚Äôs already deployed it‚Äôs just in a box

bug-reports 2021-11-12 19:41:01 This thing called
bug-reports 2021-11-12 19:41:06 **infinite fuel**
bug-reports 2021-11-12 19:41:35 literally almost everyone thinks their engine dying or not starting is because of a bug
bug-reports 2021-11-12 19:41:44 But there is no such bug
bug-reports 2021-11-12 19:42:00 Since it‚Äôs pretty embedded to the core of the game code for it to break so easily
bug-reports 2021-11-13 13:09:05 No it‚Äôs the hitbox of the build
bug-reports 2021-11-13 13:09:21 you can expierence the same thing in another game called build a boat for treasure
bug-reports 2021-11-13 13:09:56 You basically fire a harpoon and since the harpoon has a hitbox it expands
bug-reports 2021-11-13 13:10:22 Or it could just be that you have the power to delete the world
bug-reports 2021-11-13 13:10:53 Flinker bug perhaps?

bug-reports 2021-11-13 19:25:15 i would recommend double saving builds
bug-reports 2021-11-13 19:25:40 I think if you try to save the build now, it will register that singular block as the entire build.

bug-reports 2021-11-19 12:46:10 it‚Äôs a feature
bug-reports 2021-11-19 12:46:15 to prevent light bombs
bug-reports 2021-11-19 12:59:16 Have a better performance device basically
bug-reports 2021-11-19 13:36:02 It‚Äôs sort of not a bug
bug-reports 2021-11-19 13:36:19 it‚Äôs called camera locking
bug-reports 2021-11-19 13:36:51 it‚Äôs more of breaking motors
bug-reports 2021-11-19 13:36:56 not tilting them
bug-reports 2021-11-19 13:37:18 no
bug-reports 2021-11-19 13:37:30 when I mean break motors
bug-reports 2021-11-19 13:37:33 I mean break motors
bug-reports 2021-11-19 13:37:42 Like
bug-reports 2021-11-19 13:37:47 If set to lock
bug-reports 2021-11-19 13:37:59 it could just tear the motorlock out of the base of the motor
bug-reports 2021-11-19 13:39:09 It does
bug-reports 2021-11-19 13:39:13 lock just locks the motor
bug-reports 2021-11-19 13:39:21 so it‚Äôs basically
bug-reports 2021-11-19 13:39:24 part of the build
bug-reports 2021-11-19 13:39:32 instead of being it own
bug-reports 2021-11-19 13:40:28 you can DM me the video
bug-reports 2021-11-19 13:42:00 the spinning is caused by the engine spinning in 1 direction
bug-reports 2021-11-19 13:42:19 Basically
bug-reports 2021-11-19 13:42:27 to either reduce or stop the spinning
bug-reports 2021-11-19 13:42:30 Reduce the torque
bug-reports 2021-11-19 13:42:34 The lowest you can go is 0.01
bug-reports 2021-11-19 13:44:33 a jet engine?
bug-reports 2021-11-19 13:45:13 then it could be the fault of the build then.
bug-reports 2021-11-19 13:45:17 Since jets don‚Äôt spin
bug-reports 2021-11-19 14:12:40 because

bug-reports 2021-11-24 15:40:21 I‚Äôm not sure if thats true
bug-reports 2021-11-24 15:40:22 because
bug-reports 2021-11-24 15:40:27 even though it‚Äôs somewhat correct
bug-reports 2021-11-24 15:40:34 FPS seems to effect it
bug-reports 2021-11-24 15:40:41 so it‚Äôs pretty RNG based on FPS
bug-reports 2021-11-24 15:41:07 This is supported by physics fps

bug-reports 2021-11-24 19:28:19 he didn‚Äôt see any damage
bug-reports 2021-11-24 19:28:30 red prob means server sided damage
bug-reports 2021-11-24 19:28:37 Yellow is prob client side damage
bug-reports 2021-11-24 19:29:12 doing damage and not doing damage is a big difference

creations-chat 2021-12-08 12:37:29 <@!849557593046777886> is physics not effecting your shredder? Without any conveyor engines and hover engines, you can‚Äôt go past 650 it‚Äôs like physics doesn‚Äôt apply for you.
creations-chat 2021-12-08 12:39:32 It that‚Äôs not true. He is using wing panels. You can see them holding up the rockets
Wing panels also have this weird property where it barely goes past 650 without the use of conveyor engine and hover engine.
creations-chat 2021-12-08 12:43:53 no. You can‚Äôt force a wing panel to go faster than 650 speed without the use of conveyor engines or hover engines. At least that‚Äôs from what I‚Äôve seen. 
Maybe slightly but not at speeds upward of 2K
creations-chat 2021-12-08 12:46:16 Not to mention the supposing lack of gravity? But I‚Äôll give that the benefit of the doubt that it could be the wing panels.
Wait that isn‚Äôt possible. The shredder points at the cursor <:what:644996672048463942>
creations-chat 2021-12-08 12:54:35 They are fast but they are usually hindered by wing panels
creations-chat 2021-12-08 12:57:08 yoo double warn!
Rip bozo
creations-chat 2021-12-08 13:05:24 Do you have a conveyor engine in that shredder bug though.
creations-chat 2021-12-08 18:31:34 What sorcery are you doing
I couldn‚Äôt go past 700sps and you did 2K?
I strapped a load of rockets onto the plane crazy tutorial planes and it could barely go 700 since it keeps on dying
bug-reports 2021-12-09 05:45:55 That‚Äôs the basics of lag
bug-reports 2021-12-09 05:46:05 lag is called latency
bug-reports 2021-12-09 05:46:13 but the bullet isn‚Äôt server sided
bug-reports 2021-12-09 05:46:16 It‚Äôs client sided
bug-reports 2021-12-09 05:46:35 so it‚Äôs hit reg problem
bug-reports 2021-12-09 05:46:38 Well
bug-reports 2021-12-09 05:46:40 not really
bug-reports 2021-12-09 05:46:44 it works fine
bug-reports 2021-12-09 05:46:51 it‚Äôs just that it hits too early
bug-reports 2021-12-09 05:47:00 and doesn‚Äôt display the correct blocks hit
bug-reports 2021-12-09 05:47:31 that delay isn‚Äôt your wifi
bug-reports 2021-12-09 05:47:35 i don‚Äôt think it is anyway

bug-reports 2021-12-11 06:36:52 Not that no one is fixing it
bug-reports 2021-12-11 06:36:58 it‚Äôs more that rickje don‚Äôt want to fix it
bug-reports 2021-12-11 06:37:12 It‚Äôs technically a save file problem
bug-reports 2021-12-11 06:37:16 which rickje knew about

the-dump 2021-12-14 17:19:17 wtf
bug-reports 2021-12-15 12:21:59 it‚Äôs not violently shaking. It‚Äôs just that physics per second is not consistent
bug-reports 2021-12-15 12:22:12 or is too Low
bug-reports 2021-12-15 12:24:04 The higher the physics per second the less wobble
bug-reports 2021-12-15 12:24:11 so yes Plane crazy is performance based

events-chat 2022-01-09 16:20:07 Wait does torpedo have to be 1x1?
events-chat 2022-01-09 16:25:31 but they can be more than 1 block tall?
events-chat 2022-01-09 16:26:15 well shit
events-chat 2022-01-09 16:26:31 i made a 1x1 guided torp for no reason

events-chat 2022-01-10 01:03:40 Then the block is basically banned
events-chat 2022-01-10 01:04:08 anyway I don‚Äôt think you will need to use it
events-chat 2022-01-10 01:04:25 since piston set to lock do crash the clients game
events-chat 2022-01-10 01:04:43 making the playing field very one sided
events-chat 2022-01-10 01:05:28 you will be hit by rockets, bullets, torpedos and cutters
events-chat 2022-01-10 01:05:46 So there‚Äôs a pretty high chance your piston lock just gets hit
bug-reports 2022-01-10 01:07:23 How odd
bug-reports 2022-01-10 01:07:40 It‚Äôs that same plane from yesterday

events-chat 2022-01-10 01:55:24 What if torpedos that fly because of funny
events-chat 2022-01-10 01:55:47 Use disconnectors and rockets
events-chat 2022-01-10 01:56:19 Good on paper, shit in practice
events-chat 2022-01-10 01:56:39 also <@!466793357318815744> you should ban the use of Ice torpedos. <:trollface:775024642104229898>
events-chat 2022-01-10 01:58:22 plane Crazy has weird ice near the ocean. It can force the torpedo to propel to its max speed but since it‚Äôs on ice there is no resistance

events-chat 2022-01-12 01:29:41 I‚Äôm still in the process of refining my 1x1 guided torpedo since it‚Äôs not very accurate for the time being.
events-chat 2022-01-12 01:29:58 having no stabilisers is hard.
events-chat 2022-01-12 01:31:02 Sort of. Torpedos are fine but you have to adjust the CG to be near center
events-chat 2022-01-12 01:42:15 That was 3x3
events-chat 2022-01-12 01:42:32 When I mean 1x1 it‚Äôs quite literally a stick.

events-chat 2022-01-12 23:42:06 Depending on where you hit

creations-chat 2022-01-13 04:29:26 Why are you crying about this. He **doxxed** that means he has peoples IPs and that‚Äôs a legitimate **crime** how hard is it to understand and who the fuck knows how many more people he doxxed because he received bad feedback from the aeronautica community.

Because the furry in question doxxed someone in another server with 5K people in it
creations-chat 2022-01-13 04:32:57 no its just your scope is wrong. I know not only furries doxx but at least people doxx for the money.
The person who doxxed only doxxed because he got trash talked on.
creations-chat 2022-01-13 04:35:00 But how is it possible when you don‚Äôt know who‚Äôs the other person and what their interests and hobbies are. How is it possible to know all of these without committing a crime.

the-dump 2022-02-07 15:41:26 wow
the-dump 2022-02-07 15:41:29 epic embed failure
the-dump 2022-02-07 15:41:36 ok point is
the-dump 2022-02-07 15:41:37 stop
the-dump 2022-02-07 15:41:55 do not add a fucking harddrive onto a laptop <@!426802747875131393>
the-dump 2022-02-07 15:42:28 I can guarantee you your hard drive will shit itself
the-dump 2022-02-07 15:42:42 Hard drives aren‚Äôt really made for laptops
the-dump 2022-02-07 15:42:56 Then you need to turn off your laptop all the time
the-dump 2022-02-07 15:43:06 Most of them have SSDs
the-dump 2022-02-07 15:43:09 solid state drives
the-dump 2022-02-07 15:43:34 because HDD is cheaper
the-dump 2022-02-07 15:43:53 if you shake a HDD drive while it‚Äôs running, the hard drive will not be able to be used anymore.
the-dump 2022-02-07 15:44:53 but it‚Äôs extremely risky
the-dump 2022-02-07 15:45:35 Hard disk readers are portable. But there‚Äôs a difference between a hard disk reader and a HDD
the-dump 2022-02-07 15:46:29 Your funeral
the-dump 2022-02-07 15:48:38 HDDs are more towards desktops
the-dump 2022-02-07 15:48:46 mainly because they don‚Äôt move very much
the-dump 2022-02-07 15:49:23 Rarely anyone installs a HDD in a laptop because the laptop regularly moves
the-dump 2022-02-07 15:49:38 even gaming laptops
the-dump 2022-02-07 15:50:08 there in no fun in both
the-dump 2022-02-07 15:50:39 What
the-dump 2022-02-07 15:50:40 what
the-dump 2022-02-07 15:50:42 no
the-dump 2022-02-07 15:50:43 stop
the-dump 2022-02-07 15:50:48 What are you doing
the-dump 2022-02-07 15:50:51 what are you doing
the-dump 2022-02-07 15:50:54 what are you
the-dump 2022-02-07 15:50:55 Doing
the-dump 2022-02-07 15:51:01 no
the-dump 2022-02-07 15:51:03 no!
the-dump 2022-02-07 15:51:06 You need to stop
the-dump 2022-02-07 15:51:34 There is kind of a reason why laptops are small
the-dump 2022-02-07 15:51:41 It‚Äôs for cooling reasons
the-dump 2022-02-07 15:52:06 mine are
the-dump 2022-02-07 15:52:10 they are zip files
the-dump 2022-02-07 15:52:19 but point is
the-dump 2022-02-07 15:52:29 please don‚Äôt 3D print a new cover for a laptop
the-dump 2022-02-07 15:52:36 at that point it‚Äôs just death to the laptop
the-dump 2022-02-07 15:52:53 It will fucking kill the cooling!
the-dump 2022-02-07 15:53:15 **THE OPEN FUCKING AIR WILL ONLY GO TO THE FANS**
the-dump 2022-02-07 15:53:41 No!
the-dump 2022-02-07 15:53:46 Well
the-dump 2022-02-07 15:53:49 it depends tbh
the-dump 2022-02-07 15:54:07 But most laptops utilise tight spaces for cooling to move air around efficiently
the-dump 2022-02-07 15:54:19 having an opened air case would just make the fans useless
the-dump 2022-02-07 15:54:31 only blowing the components around it
the-dump 2022-02-07 15:54:41 yeah. Brilliant fucking idea
the-dump 2022-02-07 15:54:58 I want you to find out how to install liquid nitrogen upside down
the-dump 2022-02-07 15:55:07 especially with the dry ice
the-dump 2022-02-07 15:55:27 because hot air rises. Cold air sinks
the-dump 2022-02-07 15:55:43 the heat will go up the cold will go down
the-dump 2022-02-07 15:55:49 it‚Äôs physics
the-dump 2022-02-07 15:55:56 get fucked
the-dump 2022-02-07 15:56:12 now stop with your bullshit.
the-dump 2022-02-07 15:56:36 no but it will certainly make you get a new laptop if you‚Äôre not careful enough
the-dump 2022-02-07 15:57:45 you can put air holes under the mother board
the-dump 2022-02-07 15:57:48 I can tell you that
the-dump 2022-02-07 15:57:51 But please
the-dump 2022-02-07 15:57:55 For fucking god
the-dump 2022-02-07 15:58:04 Do not make it open air case
the-dump 2022-02-07 15:58:12 it will make it become an oven
the-dump 2022-02-07 15:58:24 and practically useable
the-dump 2022-02-07 15:58:59 It will just thermal throttle
the-dump 2022-02-07 15:59:05 until it eventually turns off
the-dump 2022-02-07 15:59:48 Add a hold in the middle
the-dump 2022-02-07 15:59:56 ^
the-dump 2022-02-07 16:00:11 Do they include steam games you don‚Äôt play
the-dump 2022-02-07 16:00:59 Steam records your purchase and basically remembers if you bought it or not. So you don‚Äôt have to buy it again if you want to play it again.
the-dump 2022-02-07 16:01:11 so you could prob delete the stuff on your external drive
the-dump 2022-02-07 16:01:31 You already said that
the-dump 2022-02-07 16:01:37 i Said That
the-dump 2022-02-07 16:01:39 <:empty:794431705070174238>
the-dump 2022-02-07 16:01:54 I was talking about steam
the-dump 2022-02-07 16:02:28 There is a possibility where you can upload all your family photos to a thumb drive
the-dump 2022-02-07 16:02:32 but it‚Äôs pretty risky
the-dump 2022-02-07 16:02:54 thumb drives are SSDs but small and SSDs need power from time to time.
the-dump 2022-02-07 16:03:17 Go to another servers shitposting channel
the-dump 2022-02-07 16:03:23 <#495286269459300364> is under maintenance
the-dump 2022-02-07 16:03:30 god damn
the-dump 2022-02-07 16:03:44 to be fair
the-dump 2022-02-07 16:03:49 Garry‚Äôs mod
the-dump 2022-02-07 16:04:33 You can make a carbon copy of your current laptop case
the-dump 2022-02-07 16:04:51 From then on you can put a slot for your external drive
the-dump 2022-02-07 16:05:48 Not even roblox photos?
the-dump 2022-02-07 16:06:02 Because you wanted space
the-dump 2022-02-07 16:06:45 extend the SSD or HDD to be outside of the case?
the-dump 2022-02-07 16:06:48 that‚Äôs possible too
the-dump 2022-02-07 17:59:35 I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs possible to compress a OS file
the-dump 2022-02-07 18:00:12 At least without having your PC do weird jank.
the-dump 2022-02-07 18:00:39 because there could be a possibility that the CPU will not be able to read any of the files. So it‚Äôs something like deleting system 32
the-dump 2022-02-07 18:00:48 But even worse
the-dump 2022-02-07 18:01:36 <@!426802747875131393> do you by any chance have another set of files that use up a lot of space
the-dump 2022-02-07 18:02:46 Because I don‚Äôt think 31 GBs is going to leave a huge dent on your hard drive
the-dump 2022-02-07 18:04:56 I know
the-dump 2022-02-07 18:05:10 because the CPU might not be able to read the OS file
the-dump 2022-02-07 18:05:16 because it‚Äôs compressed
the-dump 2022-02-07 18:05:38 something like making a computer do 2 in binary code
the-dump 2022-02-07 18:08:42 well is there anything else
the-dump 2022-02-07 18:09:06 I mean
the-dump 2022-02-07 18:09:08 That‚Äôs enough?

bug-reports 2022-02-11 17:51:23 Ping and latency bugs looks to be wrong?
bug-reports 2022-02-11 17:51:27 It depends
bug-reports 2022-02-11 17:52:25 ‚ÄúTrouble loading into a game as the loading bar doesn‚Äôt move‚Äù wouldn‚Äôt really be an issue if there are bottlenecks.
bug-reports 2022-02-11 17:52:48 whenever loading bar says ‚Äúwaiting for character‚Äù it would usually mean you‚Äôre still rendering the whole map.
bug-reports 2022-02-11 17:53:58 Ngl a lot of the bugs are those I‚Äôve basically never heard of before.
bug-reports 2022-02-11 17:54:30 Like third person camera under internal plane crazy bugs
bug-reports 2022-02-11 18:06:56 then that wouldn‚Äôt be a bug?
bug-reports 2022-02-11 18:07:24 yeah but
bug-reports 2022-02-11 18:07:28 why.
bug-reports 2022-02-11 18:07:55 They can check their pings and discover that it‚Äôs on the same ping
bug-reports 2022-02-11 18:08:12 Which would mean that a ping has not been received
bug-reports 2022-02-11 18:08:52 btw
bug-reports 2022-02-11 18:09:06 I think 200ms is just the ping you receive
bug-reports 2022-02-11 18:09:08 Not the ping you send
bug-reports 2022-02-11 18:09:13 or it could be both
bug-reports 2022-02-11 18:10:03 Also spawning on the middle of the map is kind of the ping problem to.
bug-reports 2022-02-11 18:10:17 Most of the bugs are mostly either related to ping problems or roblox issues.
bug-reports 2022-02-11 18:11:14 Btw

bug-reports 2022-02-13 18:02:55 There is actually a fix to this
bug-reports 2022-02-13 18:03:01 but it‚Äôs a little annoying
bug-reports 2022-02-13 18:04:31 **Fix to chat bug causing extreme fps drops when receiving or sending messages onto roblox servers.**

bug-reports 2022-02-13 18:05:47 But not able to find what it is because the problem only happens in some games

Can I get feedback on my build.
creations-chat 2022-02-13 18:11:34 no? It looks kinda original.
creations-chat 2022-02-13 18:13:52 But Abrams Body can‚Äôt change if what we are looking for is differences between the real and the game model.

It‚Äôs like trying to compare the McDonald‚Äôs burger to the burger on the menu. It looks the same. But when someone else ordered the same meal as you, do you give a fuck?
creations-chat 2022-02-13 18:17:52 No? The body is longer, the body is different from the image when compared from the front, <@!775192740773756968> added horns as a replacement for headlights.

Honestly I can see where you‚Äôre going with this. But given a choice between pvp and lokks but you want to choose both is hard.
But unless if you can find a founder barrel that looks somewhat decent and has a firework then it‚Äôs not going to change a whole lot between other tanks.
creations-chat 2022-02-13 18:21:37 Bogs wheels can move. Doom.#3839‚Äôs wheels can‚Äôt.
Also I‚Äôm not sure if you noticed but the base of the Unmotorlocked version looks like a tiger. <@456226577798135808>
creations-chat 2022-02-13 18:26:58 But honestly I don‚Äôt think he is trying to copy. It could be a problem with building this small because there aren‚Äôt a lot of possibilities to differ from when making a Abrams.
But who wouldn‚Äôt put emojis on their wheels on a build this small to add depth
creations-chat 2022-02-13 18:31:30 Also. According to bogs, the tank isn‚Äôt even suppose to be an Abrams. The tank is based loosely on the Abrams that he called bill!
creations-chat 2022-02-13 18:35:06 If it was really for the upvotes then it wouldn‚Äôt work because he it looked horrible!

But why would he need to copy if he had a good looking build.
79-10

Ok not very good looking but it gets the point through.
creations-chat 2022-02-13 18:39:08 Maybe if you looked hard enough or squinted your eyes a little it may look like a challenger 2. Bogs tank literally didn‚Äôt closely resemble the Abrams
creations-chat 2022-02-13 18:42:48 If you knew it‚Äôs bad and you think it‚Äôs a copy, why attack it when it‚Äôs horrible and you know won‚Äôt do well.
creations-chat 2022-02-13 18:45:06 I couldn‚Äôt fucking agree more.
There literally isn‚Äôt enough types of barrels and bodies for 4 thousand people to use. <:empty:794431705070174238>

Why would he copy in the first place if it didnt look like an Abrams.
creations-chat 2022-02-13 18:47:09 We literally have less than 10 different types of barrels that ro scalers can use for their 5 wide tanks at best. <:empty:794431705070174238>

You aren‚Äôt the only fucking guy living on earth. **accept that there will always be a copy or something similar to the product around the world**
creations-chat 2022-02-13 18:51:00 Because of how limiting plane crazy currently is. You can‚Äôt expect everyone‚Äôs Abrams to not have some feature that look similar or are literally the same from the other tank
I was using the barrel as an example
creations-chat 2022-02-13 18:54:13 Why don‚Äôt you make a Abrams the same scale as bogs tank and try to add as much detail as possible.
creations-chat 2022-02-13 18:56:28 But what‚Äôs the point if he knew it looked horrible <:empty:794431705070174238> 
I have no idea how many times I have to explain this.
creations-chat 2022-02-13 18:58:37 I‚Äôm trying to bring that mindset across and it‚Äôs proving difficult to communicate to a expert.
creations-chat 2022-02-13 19:00:49 <@456226577798135808> at this point. Fine you win I‚Äôll have it your way and say it‚Äôs copy. Now do me a favour an shut up for 5 hours I need sleep.

I swear to fucking god if you can find something wrong with this
creations-chat 2022-02-13 19:03:41 Because plane Crazy is limited in the number of things we can build. There is **no infinite** in this game

We have been ranting about this shit for 40 minutes like an angry couple who got cheated on holy shit.
At this point I need you to look back at past messages it would prob help you understand better.
creations-chat 2022-02-13 19:06:21 I‚Äôm trying to show you how limited plane crazy is. Especially when <#384025409945337856> is a place where realism and fiction have differences. They do in a general sense but <#384025409945337856> is more biased to realism over fiction.
bug-reports 2022-02-13 19:07:52 Always has been
creations-chat 2022-02-13 19:09:15 I think this topic has finally subsided
I‚Äôm going to sleep now.

the-dump 2022-03-05 17:00:11 And <#504436696021204992> a little
the-dump 2022-03-05 17:09:55 It‚Äôs a shitty unfunny meme
the-dump 2022-03-05 17:10:04 I say this because I don‚Äôt understand the meme
the-dump 2022-03-05 17:11:06 Clearly you don‚Äôt own an airfryer
the-dump 2022-03-05 17:12:01 Clearly you don‚Äôt own a bladder
the-dump 2022-03-05 19:58:46 That game is based around car mechanics

the-dump 2022-03-05 20:02:47 It‚Äôs an nsfw website dumbfuck

bug-reports 2022-03-05 20:06:34 Incase anyone got kicked for ‚Äúunexpected client behaviour‚Äù and is thinking about what that means, it‚Äôs an anti lag bomb system that kicks the player or badly behaving client out of the server.
the-dump 2022-03-05 20:08:24 I would too
the-dump 2022-03-05 20:08:48 Yes
the-dump 2022-03-05 20:10:14 There are places to be optimised
the-dump 2022-03-05 20:10:25 Plane Crazy rn isn‚Äôt a good car game
the-dump 2022-03-05 20:10:41 and is more suited for aircraft
the-dump 2022-03-05 20:10:59 But the physics is definitely there
the-dump 2022-03-05 20:11:27 it behaves slightly differently on dirt and plastic
the-dump 2022-03-05 20:11:34 and especially snow and grass
the-dump 2022-03-05 20:11:37 even ice
the-dump 2022-03-05 20:12:02 it can be compared to a dirt rally game but wouldn‚Äôt fair good
the-dump 2022-03-05 20:12:48 you can make the best looking rally car in plane crazy and it wouldn‚Äôt be comfortable
the-dump 2022-03-05 20:13:59 Gears?

the-dump 2022-03-05 20:14:29 got fed up with the game after finding out that steering is a nightmare
the-dump 2022-03-05 20:14:54 Can you screenshot gears
the-dump 2022-03-05 20:15:06 or is it just a block
the-dump 2022-03-05 20:15:29 I don‚Äôt see a use in them in plane crazy other than to make a computer
the-dump 2022-03-05 20:15:51 I would rather a block with a motor attached
the-dump 2022-03-05 20:16:05 6 gear motor

bug-reports 2022-03-20 19:08:29 But it‚Äôs been in the game long enough to be called a ‚Äúfeature‚Äù
bug-reports 2022-03-21 17:52:23 Firstly. Use motorlock to lock your build after folding. 
Secondly. This is a known bug with the water propellers. There is no way to counter this issue as of right now because it seems to defy physics.

the-dump 2022-03-29 13:03:35 <@!393527373729103888> folds should still help make large builds possible
the-dump 2022-03-29 13:03:49 idk but it might not change
the-dump 2022-03-29 13:04:11 Why though
the-dump 2022-03-29 13:04:22 rn plots are higher than their width
the-dump 2022-03-29 13:05:31 I‚Äôm not sure why you would need that mouth space though
the-dump 2022-03-29 13:06:42 i believe carriers can be wider with the plot extension
the-dump 2022-03-29 13:07:11 Rn big carriers usually have 4 folds
the-dump 2022-03-29 13:07:22 And also have their walls motorlock outwards
the-dump 2022-03-29 13:08:10 With plot extension it should allow most of the folds to be replaced
the-dump 2022-03-29 13:08:14 Basically made wider
the-dump 2022-03-29 13:08:29 that‚Äôs kinda crazy though

the-dump 2022-04-26 13:31:18 I pinged a mod to get it removed

the-dump 2022-04-26 13:34:29 forklifts are too big
the-dump 2022-04-26 13:34:33 cars are too big
the-dump 2022-04-26 13:34:39 and if planes are alive
the-dump 2022-04-26 13:34:44 are missiles alive?
the-dump 2022-04-26 13:35:18 does shooting down another plane count as murder under international law or Maritime law
the-dump 2022-04-26 13:35:52 everything in cars and planes are weird
the-dump 2022-04-26 13:36:17 Oh yeah him
the-dump 2022-04-26 13:36:36 also what do amphibious vehicles count as
the-dump 2022-04-26 13:36:46 boat or car
the-dump 2022-04-26 13:36:57 do they have to pay cargo taxes
the-dump 2022-04-26 13:37:03 do they need a passport
the-dump 2022-04-26 13:37:14 i think you know how
the-dump 2022-04-26 13:37:20 but we shouldn‚Äôt go into this topic
the-dump 2022-04-26 13:37:28 same with cars
the-dump 2022-04-26 13:37:37 and do cruise ships have a hotel
the-dump 2022-04-26 13:37:43 or a house
the-dump 2022-04-26 13:37:56 What do submarines class as in war
the-dump 2022-04-26 13:38:08 almost everything has a hotel in the world of cars and planes
the-dump 2022-04-26 13:39:04 What would a tank be or look like in cars and planes universe
the-dump 2022-04-26 13:39:19 and would they be manned by forklifts or itself be alive
the-dump 2022-04-26 13:39:31 and if it is alive how does it get it‚Äôs ammo stowage filled
the-dump 2022-04-26 13:39:53 what
the-dump 2022-04-26 13:39:57 what
the-dump 2022-04-26 13:40:08 What are you on about
the-dump 2022-04-26 13:40:24 fair enough
the-dump 2022-04-26 13:40:38 but where does the electricity come from
the-dump 2022-04-26 13:41:12 Trains are alive but can they be repurposed to generate eletricity?
the-dump 2022-04-26 13:41:24 Would that count as murder or harassment?
the-dump 2022-04-26 13:41:27 Is it illegal?
the-dump 2022-04-26 13:41:54 They generate pretty little considering how many there are
the-dump 2022-04-26 13:42:11 cars and planes should be depicted in the real world
the-dump 2022-04-26 13:42:18 So they prob use real world stuff too
the-dump 2022-04-26 13:42:23 Just not in the conventional way
the-dump 2022-04-26 13:43:24 if trains are alive, do they mind having several cars in them
the-dump 2022-04-26 13:43:56 can cargo ships get boarded by Somalian forklifts on wooden alive boats

bug-reports 2022-04-30 21:09:20 Client to server issue. It‚Äôs usually a roblox feature to stop the client from rendering too many items or objects. 
It‚Äôs basically a sphere that follows you everywhere. It serves almost everything you do. It tells the game where to render the shadows around you, what you‚Äôre on, what is ahead of you and what you can render around you. Increasing graphics won‚Äôt increase the range of what you can render.
bug-reports 2022-04-30 21:20:08 1.5GHz tri-core 64-bit ARMv8-A "Typhoon" against a I5-8265U quad core processor.
Well the ipad would have the advantage here because of the client and the processor. The iPad wouldn‚Äôt usually have the advantage but it has because roblox can make the client run on lower resolution textures to improve performance. 
iPad would usually win at the start but won‚Äôt win when you play on it for 15 minutes.
bug-reports 2022-04-30 21:20:27 Also GPU will affect the physics a little
bug-reports 2022-04-30 21:22:41 But then again the I5-8265U isn‚Äôt really good. It‚Äôs comparable to your Samsung smart fridge running Twitter.
bug-reports 2022-04-30 21:23:01 so it may affect your fps which would cause the wobble

bot-central 2022-05-01 13:13:21 And it‚Äôs completely optional as they have toilet paper

bot-central 2022-05-01 13:24:53 max is 4K
bot-central 2022-05-01 13:24:57 or 2k
bot-central 2022-05-01 13:25:00 one of the 2
bot-central 2022-05-01 13:25:05 2160p

bot-central 2022-05-01 13:26:02 it just doesn‚Äôt take pictures at 4K
bot-central 2022-05-01 13:26:53 you do because it isn‚Äôt limited by apple
bot-central 2022-05-01 13:27:07 for whatever reason the photos in 4K are compressed
bot-central 2022-05-01 13:28:13 Also it wouldn‚Äôt make a difference between apple and android because these 2 are just phones
bot-central 2022-05-01 13:28:39 If you‚Äôre there for an occasion you expect, you would always get the thing that suits the occasion
bot-central 2022-05-01 13:28:57 the phone is just there for convenience

creations-chat 2022-05-22 18:10:33 <@900857307523612693> your engine is shit
creations-chat 2022-05-22 18:12:57 Anything else?
3.36 torque output
Spins at 130 sps

Better than yours lol. Yours is long, looks like it‚Äôs going to not fit into anything and can‚Äôt move
creations-chat 2022-05-22 18:15:14 Your timer is also short and doesn‚Äôt force the hover to produce maximum output with disconnectors.

It also doesn‚Äôt have a proper starter motor
creations-chat 2022-05-22 18:17:27 Mine does self start but I was doing torque tests with it which required the starter.
Also self starting isn‚Äôt really what I need for this since some of the time it just chokes itself

Your engine is also unnecessary long.
Even though you and I use the same way to put the cylinders into position yours is for whatever reason long.
creations-chat 2022-05-22 18:21:54 Wdym you tried. couldn‚Äôt you have made the hover engines themselves only stick to 3-4 blocks wide instead of 6? And what about the random spaces in between each of the cylinders that actually had nothing. With that amount of space you can make your engine even fast and stronger.

You didn‚Äôt fucking try hard enough
Plus you wanted me to provide an image of my engine if I were to downvote your engine. So in truth you are the one who started this.
creations-chat 2022-05-22 18:25:27 the way you rotate your cylinders position is very inconsistent so you prob can‚Äôt even get an accurate reading on how fast your engine goes

Barely anyone makes hover engines due to its performance intensive properties that make hover piston engine making hard
creations-chat 2022-05-22 18:27:20 People do. It‚Äôs just to what and how complicated it is.
If you show the community it actually works and actually meets what you said it does, people will know and prob give you the upvotes.

creations-chat 2022-05-23 19:12:48 <@479298992874979328> I don‚Äôt see any uses in variable strokes.
creations-chat 2022-05-23 19:16:16 Yeah but why not just make the timing to activate the hover thrusters variable.
creations-chat 2022-05-23 19:20:26 I think making my engine have lesser strokes wouldnt work properly. It‚Äôs currently in its smallest configuration and I‚Äôve largely ditched the idea of inline of V configuration engines because the hovers produce downforce when activated. 
So I have these motorlocked hovers which all activate at the same time. The disconnectors also force the hovers to active 110% whenever the disconnectors are inside them.

I say 110% because rickje didn‚Äôt make hovers have the ability to go to 0 value and keeps giving me constant problems when trying to stall the engine with a heavy flywheel
creations-chat 2022-05-23 19:22:27 I think it hasn‚Äôt occured to you that he is a whitename
creations-chat 2022-05-23 19:24:10 Because ritualfishy thinks you have ranks to access the private servers provided by the admins called VIP1 / VIP2.

I‚Äôm literally helping you clarify with him so he can help you <:stuff:908917207986208828>
creations-chat 2022-05-23 19:26:41 People in PCC know more about the game than randoms in public servers. So most of the time we just ask someone to join one of the four VIP servers for help or as either here, <#478584971670454284>, <#384021699466756107> or <#497142796961054721>

We can meet with people in public but most of the time randoms would attempt to copy. We usually let them do because it produces funny results. However people now are vary since plane crazy has been exploited before.

bug-reports 2022-07-04 15:15:07 This is for all propellers but the server sided view for everyone else takes longer for server to register. Basically you can cheat the system with robloxs incompetence
bug-reports 2022-07-04 15:17:07 False. Some people experience very random loss of physics to all vehicles.
bug-reports 2022-07-04 15:17:30 reported roughly a year ago
bug-reports 2022-07-04 15:18:30 It kind of does since the ground underneath the runway isn‚Äôt flat and the runway collisions do eventually return along the runway and gives this very hard bump for anything that uses the runway.

bug-reports 2022-07-08 02:45:57 This isn‚Äôt really a game breaking bug since most of the time stacking motors is usually used for motorlock. The grey parts of the motor do have weight on them. That and with the roblox physics engine and I think it‚Äôs clear why you are slower.

bug-reports 2022-07-08 19:22:27 roblox will always ever so slightly require you to have a better and better PC
bug-reports 2022-07-08 19:22:35 Expect change from them every week
bug-reports 2022-07-08 19:22:57 Recommended to have RTX lineup of GPUs and minimum i5 CPU
bug-reports 2022-07-08 19:23:04 not really
bug-reports 2022-07-08 19:23:14 preferably not a mac
bug-reports 2022-07-08 19:23:38 Since the status of roblox Mac applications aren‚Äôt really documented well
bug-reports 2022-07-08 19:23:51 almost everyone downloads the game from chrome
bug-reports 2022-07-08 19:23:59 Since it‚Äôs the most up to date
bug-reports 2022-07-08 19:24:07 And widely used
bug-reports 2022-07-08 19:24:40 There could be a solution
bug-reports 2022-07-08 19:25:19 If the motors are locked, turn off the lock.
bug-reports 2022-07-08 19:25:49 If they are unlocked you can use springs or disconnectors to temporarily lock the turret to the ships hull
bug-reports 2022-07-08 19:26:17 Maybe not use the anchor blocks?
bug-reports 2022-07-08 19:27:15 Yeah but most of the time anchors do come from somewhere out of this world
bug-reports 2022-07-08 19:27:45 perhaps try launching the ship without the anchor
bug-reports 2022-07-08 19:28:01 hanging it onto a rope of something
bug-reports 2022-07-08 19:28:25 Then it could be something specifically the ship had that causes this
bug-reports 2022-07-08 19:28:43 Half Pistons with the lock on can cause problems like these
bug-reports 2022-07-08 19:29:06 Then I‚Äôm out of ideas
bug-reports 2022-07-08 19:29:28 The only thing I could realistically come up with would to just hope for the best when using motor 2s
bug-reports 2022-07-08 19:29:54 But I don‚Äôt see anyway out of that either since you can‚Äôt use your ship to pvp properly without having a fire in your home.
bug-reports 2022-07-08 19:30:20 Googling might not work
bug-reports 2022-07-08 19:30:33 Plane Crazy is more or less a secluded place
bug-reports 2022-07-08 19:30:45 You‚Äôll just go onto subreddit <:clueless:942802644043464734>
bug-reports 2022-07-08 19:30:59 Idk
bug-reports 2022-07-08 19:37:41 What
bug-reports 2022-07-08 19:39:11 It prob is the lack of processing power
bug-reports 2022-07-08 19:39:30 Water is usually laggier and more performance demanding
bug-reports 2022-07-10 01:26:12 It‚Äôs much of a bug as much as the parachute deployment process
creations-chat 2022-07-10 06:30:29 You need to add more wedges at the front basically making it smoother
bug-reports 2022-07-12 12:54:23 I think the ‚Äúgame not functioning as intended‚Äù is used very loosely here.
bug-reports 2022-07-12 12:55:48 It is considered a ‚Äúglitch‚Äù
Camera lock was only suppose to be used on plane bodies without being attached to motors. People then started to put cameras on motors thinking it would work as intended and the result was camera lock.
bug-reports 2022-07-12 12:57:19 Possible that there‚Äôs a control surface linked to cursor or a motor being fucked with.

bug-reports 2022-07-14 01:48:55 Goofy ahhh avatar
bug-reports 2022-07-14 01:49:11 Performance drop
bug-reports 2022-07-14 01:49:32 It‚Äôs possible to get kicked for ‚Äúunexpected client behaviour‚Äù by using motorlock
bug-reports 2022-07-14 01:49:53 however in my tests I had 50-100 locked motors set to powered.
bug-reports 2022-07-14 03:53:29 It shows Overall CG
bug-reports 2022-07-14 03:53:48 But it does die from time to time
bug-reports 2022-07-14 03:54:10 Bad wifi perhaps
bug-reports 2022-07-14 03:54:19 yeah
bug-reports 2022-07-14 03:54:22 it can
bug-reports 2022-07-14 03:54:33 This game requires good wifi in order to function properly
bug-reports 2022-07-14 03:55:12 but there have been no updates
bug-reports 2022-07-14 03:56:29 How fast is your wifi and what specs in your device
bug-reports 2022-07-14 03:56:50 so far I only experienced it once
bug-reports 2022-07-14 03:57:05 Could you even consider it an update?
bug-reports 2022-07-14 03:57:25 it was is a relaunch of an event that occured a year ago
bug-reports 2022-07-14 03:57:51 it usually does but for the CG sphere, no
bug-reports 2022-07-14 03:58:11 the CG sphere is server sided like all the other blocks you place
bug-reports 2022-07-14 03:58:20 CL?
bug-reports 2022-07-14 03:58:33 oh
bug-reports 2022-07-14 03:58:43 I haven‚Äôt seen it so for Center of lift yet
bug-reports 2022-07-14 03:58:52 but I‚Äôve only seen it do that for CG
bug-reports 2022-07-14 03:59:15 can you show the CG sphere
bug-reports 2022-07-14 03:59:19 on your end
bug-reports 2022-07-14 03:59:23 If it happens almost everytime
bug-reports 2022-07-14 04:00:21 <@540289760229457933>
bug-reports 2022-07-14 04:01:27 What
bug-reports 2022-07-14 04:01:32 i don‚Äôt need an example
bug-reports 2022-07-14 04:02:11 I need a picture of your CG ball to actually see if it is even broken.
bug-reports 2022-07-14 04:02:27 BRO IT ISNT FUCKING BROKEN
bug-reports 2022-07-14 04:03:02 Yeah but does it affect it?
bug-reports 2022-07-14 04:03:16 does it really <:BIG2:588443778554134540>
bug-reports 2022-07-14 04:03:43 So that‚Äôs the whole build correct?
bug-reports 2022-07-14 04:04:28 The other guy‚Äôs issue was different
bug-reports 2022-07-14 04:04:39 if he placed another block, the CG hall would go further away from his plot
bug-reports 2022-07-14 04:04:55 I rarely have issues with my plane
bug-reports 2022-07-14 04:06:28 
the-dump 2022-07-14 07:28:22 what
the-dump 2022-07-14 07:28:42 bro that isnt base speed
the-dump 2022-07-14 07:28:50 3.93 is current clock speed
the-dump 2022-07-14 07:30:06 god damn
the-dump 2022-07-14 07:30:11 4.6 GHz
the-dump 2022-07-14 07:30:24 i thought the CPU would clock more than 5GHz
the-dump 2022-07-14 07:30:42 no
the-dump 2022-07-14 07:30:57 i do prefer ryzens but im rn using intel
the-dump 2022-07-14 07:31:41 why the fuck do you need that much power
the-dump 2022-07-14 07:32:22 this is my CPU specs
the-dump 2022-07-14 07:32:34 i could overclock it but i wont
the-dump 2022-07-14 07:32:42 infact i will undervolt it
the-dump 2022-07-14 07:32:50 its a Mobile CPU
the-dump 2022-07-14 07:33:14 i can overclock the CPU to make max turbo frequency go higher
the-dump 2022-07-14 07:33:29 but my laptop isnt good in cooling
the-dump 2022-07-14 07:34:23 you can use throttlstop
the-dump 2022-07-14 07:34:46 something i read about while trying to find a fix to my laptops heat issue

bug-reports 2022-07-15 22:23:42 Close to the end I believe
bug-reports 2022-07-16 11:56:51 You should‚Äôve checked your ping?
bug-reports 2022-07-16 11:58:04 I don‚Äôt think that it‚Äôs a game issue more than a roblox server issue
bug-reports 2022-07-16 11:58:19 Since plane Crazy doesn‚Äôt take charge of resetting the character
bug-reports 2022-07-16 11:59:08 Motor on the missile
bug-reports 2022-07-16 11:59:39 issues with the server and client not agreeing on where disconnected object are on some clients.
bug-reports 2022-07-16 13:31:19 Did it change <:BIG2:588443778554134540>
bug-reports 2022-07-16 13:31:40 Roblox cannot change the ping if the server doesn‚Äôt ping back
bug-reports 2022-07-16 13:31:48 so it usually shows last received ping
bug-reports 2022-07-16 16:52:55 Always has been

bug-reports 2022-07-17 16:37:55 Issues between server and client not cooperating
bug-reports 2022-07-17 16:38:09 it might actually never be fixed if the code isn‚Äôt changed.
bug-reports 2022-07-17 16:38:38 Infact maybe even with the code change it won‚Äôt be fixed
bug-reports 2022-07-17 17:44:20 That‚Äôs not what I‚Äôm talking about
bug-reports 2022-07-17 17:44:51 The communication between server and client has become longer and longer for a very long time
bug-reports 2022-07-17 17:44:58 Up most to a second
bug-reports 2022-07-17 17:45:28 rewriting won‚Äôt do anything to offset the fact that the delay is considerable
bug-reports 2022-07-17 17:46:56 At the current state of communication, one side will suffer more than the other. The developer has to choose which side to give up.
bug-reports 2022-07-17 17:47:06 server or client.
bug-reports 2022-07-17 17:47:31 no bruh
bug-reports 2022-07-17 17:48:05 I‚Äôm talking about issues between cooperation of server and clients
bug-reports 2022-07-17 17:48:18 Server being roblox inc. client being the user and their hardware.
bug-reports 2022-07-17 17:49:21 oh
bug-reports 2022-07-17 17:49:27 I have quite a few
bug-reports 2022-07-17 17:49:45 Like this bug
bug-reports 2022-07-17 17:49:57 server and client not cooperating with each other
bug-reports 2022-07-17 17:50:26 it‚Äôs the same reason why attempting to pvp with another player doesn‚Äôt work as intended resulting in the other players build floating after being shot.
bug-reports 2022-07-17 17:51:03 Plane Crazy requires server to client ping of less than 0.2 seconds
bug-reports 2022-07-17 17:51:33 roblox servers can only communicate to the client in 1 second
bug-reports 2022-07-17 17:51:49 Because of how inadequate robloxs servers are to hold anything.
bug-reports 2022-07-18 19:55:43 autosave usually save every 5-60 minutes

bug-reports 2022-07-19 13:56:56 perhaps because it‚Äôs lagging like crazy üíÄ

the-dump 2022-07-19 14:07:21 yeah
the-dump 2022-07-19 14:07:43 M is toggle minimap to give you the map since your minimap is radar
the-dump 2022-07-19 14:07:58 I can tell you every single button and their functions
the-dump 2022-07-19 14:08:23 What?
the-dump 2022-07-19 14:09:03 You‚Äôre telling me a game that allows a resolution of a microwave not being able to be used on a phone?
the-dump 2022-07-19 14:09:16 It‚Äôs not the limitations of the devices performance
the-dump 2022-07-19 14:09:45 If you aren‚Äôt aware yet extreme landing has **menus**
the-dump 2022-07-19 14:10:12 Perhaps because some of the buttons are hidden away when not in fucking use?
the-dump 2022-07-19 14:10:24 It‚Äôs an ok place to be when in an argument
the-dump 2022-07-19 14:11:18 There is a possibility that aero can be brought onto mobile
the-dump 2022-07-19 14:11:28 **But roblox will not allow it**
the-dump 2022-07-19 14:11:51 And not to mention how extremely performance intensive it is
the-dump 2022-07-19 14:12:00 **for a single city**
the-dump 2022-07-19 14:12:08 Even after optimisations
the-dump 2022-07-19 14:12:28 you can have a 3060TI and your house would still be fire just rendering lights!
the-dump 2022-07-19 14:12:59 the performance is an issue as well
the-dump 2022-07-19 14:13:01 For aeronautica
the-dump 2022-07-19 14:13:06 Infact it‚Äôs prob the main reason
the-dump 2022-07-19 14:13:34 lights can be rendered outside of the graphics rendering limits
the-dump 2022-07-19 14:14:01 To see runway lights you have to turn on a single performance quark which LITERALLY MAKES THE RUNWAY BECOME A LIGHT SHOW
the-dump 2022-07-19 14:14:35 There is no fuckign way a phone can render runway
the-dump 2022-07-19 14:14:49 there is at least 200 lights!
the-dump 2022-07-19 14:15:01 not to mention the other set of lights both inside and outside of the city!
the-dump 2022-07-19 14:15:19 Then why the fuck do you think aeronautica is still not on the phone
the-dump 2022-07-19 14:16:04 CSGO is a 2012 game?
the-dump 2022-07-19 14:16:11 and has a rendering engine that render rooms?
the-dump 2022-07-19 14:16:15 Not the whole map?
the-dump 2022-07-19 14:17:00 You are a dumbass you proved my point right fighting for your own
the-dump 2022-07-19 14:18:05 So close to nothing?

the-dump 2022-07-19 14:19:26 Somewhat
the-dump 2022-07-19 14:20:54 devs have a lot of tools though
the-dump 2022-07-19 14:21:10 they have powers to disable the rendering of shadows
the-dump 2022-07-19 14:21:52 That‚Äôs pretty obvious
the-dump 2022-07-19 14:21:58 It always happens in aero
the-dump 2022-07-19 14:22:10 at max graphics you can‚Äôt see the map edge to edge
the-dump 2022-07-19 14:22:37 Yeah
the-dump 2022-07-19 14:22:41 it was shrinked
the-dump 2022-07-19 14:22:53 it isn‚Äôt

the-dump 2022-07-20 03:43:23 use variable valves then

bug-reports 2022-07-26 14:12:24 so just change the day night settings again

the-dump 2022-07-31 17:56:14 They won‚Äôt be able to carry it
the-dump 2022-07-31 17:56:36 Yeah it isn‚Äôt
the-dump 2022-07-31 17:56:53 That‚Äôs not the point
the-dump 2022-07-31 17:57:21 i Converted the ounces into kilos without dividing them into individual gold bars üíÄ

the-dump 2022-07-31 18:00:25 Yeah
the-dump 2022-07-31 18:00:28 But it‚Äôs gold
the-dump 2022-07-31 18:00:35 Every ounce counts
the-dump 2022-07-31 18:00:36 literally
the-dump 2022-07-31 18:00:54 An increase if 0.01
the-dump 2022-07-31 18:00:59 Amazing

the-dump 2022-07-31 18:04:16 who use gold
the-dump 2022-07-31 18:04:44 Usually because it‚Äôs exact
the-dump 2022-07-31 18:04:49 Which is important for currency
the-dump 2022-07-31 18:04:52 
the-dump 2022-07-31 18:05:20 China lost a million kilos of gold üíÄ
the-dump 2022-07-31 18:05:52 a lot of money
the-dump 2022-07-31 18:06:02 it might even reach qd
the-dump 2022-07-31 18:06:13 if converted correctly
the-dump 2022-07-31 18:06:20 But no government would do that
the-dump 2022-07-31 18:06:27 Obviously <:clueless:942802644043464734>
the-dump 2022-07-31 18:08:00 Yeah
the-dump 2022-07-31 18:08:06 He‚Äôs one of the worlds richest
the-dump 2022-07-31 18:08:11 Obviously he can buy that much
the-dump 2022-07-31 18:08:20 richest?
the-dump 2022-07-31 18:08:21 So soon
the-dump 2022-07-31 18:08:37 No shit

the-dump 2022-07-31 18:11:14 Trump still got charged anyway<:stuff:908917207986208828>
the-dump 2022-07-31 18:12:03 He encouraged his followers to storm the house remember?
the-dump 2022-07-31 18:12:12 Resulting in about 3 people killed
the-dump 2022-07-31 18:12:25 Those charges
the-dump 2022-07-31 18:12:32 he would‚Äôve been arrested if not for his role
the-dump 2022-07-31 18:12:48 Literally 0
the-dump 2022-07-31 18:13:11 Ukraine would‚Äôve happened anyway <:stuff:908917207986208828>
the-dump 2022-07-31 18:13:19 trump or not
the-dump 2022-07-31 18:13:26 maybe with some slight date differences
the-dump 2022-07-31 18:14:12 What‚Äôs the argument here though <:stuff:908917207986208828>
the-dump 2022-07-31 18:14:24 Ngl that doesn‚Äôt look like Biden
the-dump 2022-07-31 18:14:41 But he is Biden
the-dump 2022-07-31 18:14:42 Somehow
the-dump 2022-07-31 18:14:48 prob the eyes
the-dump 2022-07-31 18:15:41 There is a difference in between images
the-dump 2022-07-31 18:15:54 Less old üíÄ
the-dump 2022-07-31 18:16:17 Either way
the-dump 2022-07-31 18:16:20 another image
the-dump 2022-07-31 18:16:46 Biden is older
the-dump 2022-07-31 18:16:52 He has prob seen war or something
the-dump 2022-07-31 18:16:57 Yet
the-dump 2022-07-31 18:16:57 trump hasn‚Äôt
the-dump 2022-07-31 18:17:32 ngl funniest president in the 21st century though
the-dump 2022-07-31 18:17:57 Damn those mf still be older üíÄ
the-dump 2022-07-31 18:18:26 He looks pretty young tbh
the-dump 2022-07-31 18:18:33 makes sense why he‚Äôs wearing a wig
the-dump 2022-07-31 18:18:40 Like most media outlets said he was <:clueless:942802644043464734>
the-dump 2022-07-31 18:18:53 he prob had facial surgery
the-dump 2022-07-31 18:19:22 Ukraine was prob influenced by putins decent into insanity as stated by a media outlet
the-dump 2022-07-31 18:19:43 through the use of drugs and a possible mental illness
the-dump 2022-07-31 18:19:48 Or physical
the-dump 2022-07-31 18:20:00 One has natural hair the other doesn‚Äôt
the-dump 2022-07-31 18:20:20 Hair produces <:stuff:908917207986208828>
the-dump 2022-07-31 18:20:34 Infact the hair enough can deceive the human brain
the-dump 2022-07-31 18:20:49 Yeah but media outlets have suggested that Putin may be sick
the-dump 2022-07-31 18:21:16 They do
the-dump 2022-07-31 18:21:44 putin recently has been noticed having a blanket over him suggesting that he is cold unlike the others around him.
the-dump 2022-07-31 18:21:54 Among other things
the-dump 2022-07-31 18:22:35 They have also seen Putin not being able to sit down for too long now without moving his legs.
the-dump 2022-07-31 18:22:52 Putin use to not be bale to do this until recently
the-dump 2022-07-31 18:23:03 in interviews with some people
the-dump 2022-07-31 18:23:07 idk big camera
the-dump 2022-07-31 18:23:09 All that shit
the-dump 2022-07-31 18:24:18 At least that‚Äôs what media outlets suggests that might‚Äôve triggered the Ukraine conflict in the first place
the-dump 2022-07-31 18:24:37 the media outlets are divided on this one
the-dump 2022-07-31 18:24:49 since no media outlet knows anything
the-dump 2022-07-31 18:25:12 These are all speculations and observations by experts in whatever illness Putin has
the-dump 2022-07-31 18:25:22 Or maybe have
the-dump 2022-07-31 18:27:13 He just wants his name in the history books <:stuff:908917207986208828>
the-dump 2022-07-31 18:27:30 it kind of is but to him is prob not enough
the-dump 2022-07-31 18:27:52 States üíÄ
the-dump 2022-07-31 18:28:05 worst idea known to man
the-dump 2022-07-31 18:28:29 Divided
the-dump 2022-07-31 18:28:53 Congress can‚Äôt control all the states at the same time
the-dump 2022-07-31 18:29:04 which would be the reason why they made them in the first place
the-dump 2022-07-31 18:29:20 Ukraine has USSR history
the-dump 2022-07-31 18:29:25 the most infact
the-dump 2022-07-31 18:29:40 It holds quite a lot of historical shit from the USSR
the-dump 2022-07-31 18:30:03 It is currently
the-dump 2022-07-31 18:30:10 I don‚Äôt think he might do it again though
the-dump 2022-07-31 18:30:19 Seeing the current state of the conflict
the-dump 2022-07-31 18:31:05 mf can‚Äôt defeat a big country with shitty armour and high morale. What‚Äôs the big shitter going to attack other than the weakest one which he already attacked üíÄ
the-dump 2022-07-31 18:31:31 Not only that but he‚Äôs losing

the-dump 2022-07-31 18:54:22 People in Greenland know how to deal with this
the-dump 2022-07-31 18:54:29 usually by having this thing called

the-dump 2022-07-31 18:54:50 they basically thicker curtains
the-dump 2022-07-31 18:54:58 I have
the-dump 2022-07-31 18:55:03 But just gave up watching more
the-dump 2022-07-31 18:55:05 <:stuff:908917207986208828>
the-dump 2022-07-31 18:55:10 i watched 1
the-dump 2022-07-31 18:55:15 one of the best ones
the-dump 2022-07-31 18:55:21 And after that I said fuck it
the-dump 2022-07-31 18:55:23 And went to gaming
the-dump 2022-07-31 18:55:28 gaming <:Mhm:551152556324159488>
the-dump 2022-07-31 18:55:58 Infact
the-dump 2022-07-31 18:56:01 Given a rating
the-dump 2022-07-31 18:56:18 I think arcane is a lot better than assassinations classroom
the-dump 2022-07-31 18:56:26 Both of which I watched
the-dump 2022-07-31 18:57:34 the storey of arcane is superb, the drawings are vibrant with a mix of 3D and 2D renderings, main characters and who is portrayed as what.
the-dump 2022-07-31 18:57:44 for arcane at least
the-dump 2022-07-31 18:58:15 assassinations classroom when compared makes it look like it was made by children
the-dump 2022-07-31 18:58:34 Held hostage in a school by Teachers
the-dump 2022-07-31 18:59:11 anime is not good or bad
the-dump 2022-07-31 18:59:23 anime is completely 2D though
the-dump 2022-07-31 18:59:33 it appeals to some while leaving other displeased

the-dump 2022-07-31 19:00:24 infact you‚Äôre not suggesting half of my class is one
the-dump 2022-07-31 19:00:29 **are you**
the-dump 2022-07-31 19:01:29 Anyway
the-dump 2022-07-31 19:01:45 arcane does what anime can‚Äôt
the-dump 2022-07-31 19:01:52 by quite the long shot
the-dump 2022-07-31 19:02:18 You really should
the-dump 2022-07-31 19:02:38 even though it‚Äôs inspired from LoL it‚Äôs actually a very good series
the-dump 2022-07-31 19:03:28 It isn‚Äôt overrated?
the-dump 2022-07-31 19:04:27 You were prob looking at a lot of stranger things stuff then
the-dump 2022-07-31 19:04:56 Either way
the-dump 2022-07-31 19:04:59 You should watch it
the-dump 2022-07-31 19:05:02 I insist
the-dump 2022-07-31 19:06:15 <@510454338532016139> I insist

the-dump 2022-07-31 19:06:59 Why did you ask me I thought you were the nerd
the-dump 2022-07-31 19:09:55 It is
the-dump 2022-07-31 19:10:11 still arcane nice
the-dump 2022-07-31 19:10:25 however it won‚Äôt appeal to everyone for obvious reasons
the-dump 2022-07-31 19:10:40 Preference is one

bug-reports 2022-08-01 14:06:01 you don‚Äôt fix lag
bug-reports 2022-08-01 14:06:07 it‚Äôs a performance issue
bug-reports 2022-08-01 14:06:54 water is somewhat performance intensive since it has to calculate buoyancy on all blocks on the ship and set it to 0 when disappeared.
bug-reports 2022-08-01 14:07:37 it‚Äôs currently the most performance intensive body of something in the whole game

the-dump 2022-08-02 08:52:18 He wanted to troll a community of trolls leading him to be the stupid one amongst all
the-dump 2022-08-02 08:53:18 As soon as I sent him an image of his house
the-dump 2022-08-02 08:53:33 He started to delete messages relating anything close to his address

the-dump 2022-08-02 09:35:18 Nah
the-dump 2022-08-02 09:35:25 It was directly linked to his Twitter profile

the-dump 2022-08-02 11:00:57 GET SHIT ON
the-dump 2022-08-02 11:01:22 He became stupid that‚Äôs what he did wrong
the-dump 2022-08-02 11:01:33 his brothers account had his address on Twitter
the-dump 2022-08-02 11:01:40 which resulted in him getting doxxed
the-dump 2022-08-02 11:02:03 Yeah but it‚Äôs him
the-dump 2022-08-02 11:02:07 I don‚Äôt care about the brother
the-dump 2022-08-02 11:02:19 Which is never
the-dump 2022-08-02 11:02:31 There‚Äôs prob a good reason why he has a hold on his brothers account
the-dump 2022-08-02 11:02:44 One of which includes not needing the account
the-dump 2022-08-02 11:02:58 smh
the-dump 2022-08-02 11:03:10 yeah he fucked up yesterday as well
the-dump 2022-08-02 11:03:35 Told us a fake address of where he didn‚Äôt live but lived near
the-dump 2022-08-02 11:03:58 attracted attention he didn‚Äôt need
the-dump 2022-08-02 11:04:10 Got himself doxxed linking the account to Twitter
the-dump 2022-08-02 11:04:15 nah bruh
the-dump 2022-08-02 11:04:35 he‚Äôs new?
the-dump 2022-08-02 11:04:36 What?
the-dump 2022-08-02 11:04:43 He‚Äôs **new?**
the-dump 2022-08-02 11:05:07 He did
the-dump 2022-08-02 11:05:17 I have the exact location of his house
the-dump 2022-08-02 11:05:22 That‚Äôs how bad he doxxed himself
the-dump 2022-08-02 11:05:35 i have no intent on causing harm to him
the-dump 2022-08-02 11:05:55 But it was obvious I have to scare him into doing something that could result in further trouble for him
the-dump 2022-08-02 11:05:59 seeing he‚Äôs stupid <:stuff:908917207986208828>
the-dump 2022-08-02 11:06:30 I can‚Äôt
the-dump 2022-08-02 11:06:32 It‚Äôs an image

the-dump 2022-08-02 11:06:50 I don‚Äôt need him address

the-dump 2022-08-02 11:07:56 
the-dump 2022-08-02 11:08:02 
the-dump 2022-08-02 11:08:10 It‚Äôs not even his real address
the-dump 2022-08-02 11:08:14 it‚Äôs his fake address
the-dump 2022-08-02 11:08:30 it‚Äôs a veterans home near a port üíÄ
the-dump 2022-08-02 11:09:05 No he doxxed himself
the-dump 2022-08-02 11:09:12 he doesn‚Äôt live in a veterans home
the-dump 2022-08-02 11:09:49 Idk the address he gave us sent us to a veterans district filled with several houses cramped into a small patch outside of a small port
the-dump 2022-08-02 11:10:24 Just googling the location makes you do ü§®
the-dump 2022-08-02 11:10:51 Copy and pasting whatever he said would make you question a lot
the-dump 2022-08-02 11:11:10 Like why a housing district has zones
the-dump 2022-08-02 11:11:33 And why it has a record of the number of houses if it‚Äôs a housing district
the-dump 2022-08-02 11:12:02 I‚Äôm not leaking his address <:stuff:908917207986208828>
the-dump 2022-08-02 11:12:07 he isn‚Äôt in danger
the-dump 2022-08-02 11:12:13 He‚Äôs just in trouble from his brother
the-dump 2022-08-02 11:12:18 And maybe his family

the-dump 2022-08-02 11:12:32 We know that
the-dump 2022-08-02 11:12:45 Yeah

the-dump 2022-08-03 16:01:44 It‚Äôs a 2019 build
the-dump 2022-08-03 16:02:08 You want an explanation for why he has expert or not
the-dump 2022-08-03 16:02:22 Then keep crying
the-dump 2022-08-03 16:02:49 I don‚Äôt think so

the-dump 2022-08-03 16:03:34 It didn‚Äôt take more time to make

the-dump 2022-08-03 16:04:11 Hereforgame
the-dump 2022-08-03 16:05:08 I think hereforgam3 has a valid argument
the-dump 2022-08-03 16:05:37 <@685909594932773033> is a news reporter
the-dump 2022-08-03 16:05:44 That wants to quit his job <:trollface:775024642104229898>
the-dump 2022-08-03 16:06:05 how else to quit but to rant about this guy on the internet
the-dump 2022-08-03 16:06:32 On live tele
the-dump 2022-08-03 16:44:39 No
the-dump 2022-08-03 16:44:50 That‚Äôs not the reason why he has expert rank
the-dump 2022-08-03 16:45:20 2019 was a year where expert ranks only required somewhere around 80-40 upvotes
the-dump 2022-08-03 16:45:52 at the time the jukebox was a pretty good build
the-dump 2022-08-03 16:46:04 If reposted, it would obviously not do as well

the-dump 2022-08-03 16:47:11 Leaving the jukebox being a relic of the past
the-dump 2022-08-03 16:47:22 however it can still be granted a expert rank

bug-reports 2022-08-04 05:56:50 There‚Äôs just too much resistance for it to move

bug-reports 2022-08-11 03:48:16 ok
bug-reports 2022-08-12 13:45:41 Known bug
bug-reports 2022-08-12 13:45:48 Infact very well known
the-dump 2022-08-13 13:37:07 Smh you suck
the-dump 2022-08-13 13:37:50 There‚Äôs little to no difference between iOS and android
the-dump 2022-08-13 13:37:56 hardware and software
the-dump 2022-08-13 13:38:01 both equally sucks
the-dump 2022-08-13 13:38:27 android is slightly worse than iOS
the-dump 2022-08-13 13:38:33 but both suck anyway
the-dump 2022-08-13 13:38:48 iOS has its own scripting application but crashes when you create a loop
the-dump 2022-08-13 13:39:17 iOS
the-dump 2022-08-13 13:39:30 simply because I get them from my parents when they don‚Äôt use it anymore <:clueless:942802644043464734>
the-dump 2022-08-13 13:39:38 I have
the-dump 2022-08-13 13:39:40 its worse
the-dump 2022-08-13 13:40:01 oh really?
the-dump 2022-08-13 13:40:08 What about the screen
the-dump 2022-08-13 13:40:18 its grainy
the-dump 2022-08-13 13:40:23 don‚Äôt you realise that?
the-dump 2022-08-13 13:40:36 I compared it with an oppo
the-dump 2022-08-13 13:40:39 Samsung
the-dump 2022-08-13 13:40:58 and another phone brand i dont know
the-dump 2022-08-13 13:41:14 but all had grainy screens
the-dump 2022-08-13 13:41:26 its like it has sweat on it
the-dump 2022-08-13 13:42:23 Newer flagship phones have better cameras than apple phones but there isn‚Äôt a good use for 100x zoom <:stuff:908917207986208828>
the-dump 2022-08-13 13:43:11 they were all relatively modern phones
the-dump 2022-08-13 13:43:23 no less than 3 years old
the-dump 2022-08-13 13:43:30 And they look like they‚Äôve been through WW2
the-dump 2022-08-13 13:44:15 There isn‚Äôt a point in a 100x camera you know
the-dump 2022-08-13 13:44:17 its useless
the-dump 2022-08-13 13:44:31 you need a fucking tripod to actually take a good picture in 100x
the-dump 2022-08-13 13:44:39 And no one carries that around with a phone
the-dump 2022-08-13 13:44:42 Its just stupid
the-dump 2022-08-13 13:45:03 Apple prices have been this way because its an apple thing
the-dump 2022-08-13 13:45:56 Large array of phones yes but a phone is a phone, it calls it has games, it can perform decently and open PDFs that‚Äôs a good phone
the-dump 2022-08-13 13:46:15 You don‚Äôt need 100 types of phone that all look like stoves
the-dump 2022-08-13 13:46:28 There is but at what cost
the-dump 2022-08-13 13:46:35 I‚Äôm not talking price wise

bug-reports 2022-08-20 12:34:09 Then don‚Äôt use hover engines
the-dump 2022-08-20 19:48:36 Just play deadline bruh it‚Äôs more than this doodle
the-dump 2022-08-20 19:49:08 It‚Äôs a game that challenges what‚Äôs possible to be placed on guns
the-dump 2022-08-20 19:49:20 Basically cursed gun game
the-dump 2022-08-20 19:49:26 but you get to shoot people
the-dump 2022-08-20 19:49:31 ammunition types exist
the-dump 2022-08-20 19:49:42 including dragons breath which I like very much
the-dump 2022-08-20 19:49:52 literally a flare at night lol
the-dump 2022-08-20 19:50:11 They don‚Äôt combust
the-dump 2022-08-20 19:50:15 nothing does
the-dump 2022-08-20 19:50:18 It‚Äôs just shoot to kill
the-dump 2022-08-20 19:50:31 if you play around in console a little
the-dump 2022-08-20 19:50:36 shit goes to shit
the-dump 2022-08-20 19:51:18 For starters
the-dump 2022-08-20 19:51:23 When playing with console
the-dump 2022-08-20 19:53:00 https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/608409033031811110/972520842082807858/test_channel.mp4
the-dump 2022-08-20 19:53:04 Also this
the-dump 2022-08-20 19:53:09 some dev made it
the-dump 2022-08-20 19:53:19 80 round drum mag with fires breath
the-dump 2022-08-20 19:55:05 The sun in the palm of your hands
the-dump 2022-08-20 19:55:08 
the-dump 2022-08-20 19:55:14 Unfortunately patched
the-dump 2022-08-20 19:55:19 but still fun
the-dump 2022-08-20 19:55:30 It got pretty bright
the-dump 2022-08-20 19:55:43 the tactic was so fucking good the devs had to vault it
the-dump 2022-08-20 19:55:55 it was even more effective at night when no one could see üíÄ
the-dump 2022-08-20 19:58:04 I just run pistol setups lol
the-dump 2022-08-20 19:58:31 Who says I have to
the-dump 2022-08-20 19:58:42 rifles are for those who have no skill
the-dump 2022-08-20 19:58:55 pistol is for the strong
the-dump 2022-08-20 19:59:02 it‚Äôs actually pretty effective
the-dump 2022-08-20 19:59:09 since you go super fast
the-dump 2022-08-20 19:59:20 you can also change ammo types now
the-dump 2022-08-20 19:59:45 So you can basically make a G17 fire the destroyer of worlds
the-dump 2022-08-20 19:59:56 you can also convert a G17 to G18
the-dump 2022-08-20 20:00:08 Resulting in you having the smallest most uncontrollable sun machine gun
the-dump 2022-08-20 20:00:41 in insurgent I just have a makarov and a mosin
the-dump 2022-08-20 20:00:55 makarov with 80 round drum
the-dump 2022-08-20 20:01:01 Mosin with irons
the-dump 2022-08-20 20:01:16 it works
the-dump 2022-08-20 20:01:18 Somehow
the-dump 2022-08-20 20:01:25 I wouldn‚Äôt suggest irons on the mosin though
the-dump 2022-08-20 20:01:27 They suck
the-dump 2022-08-20 20:01:32 No
the-dump 2022-08-20 20:01:41 They don‚Äôt zoom much
the-dump 2022-08-20 20:01:53 and you can‚Äôt really see much infront of you through the sights
the-dump 2022-08-20 20:02:25 they should
the-dump 2022-08-20 20:02:35 Not everyone can afford an 8k TV
the-dump 2022-08-20 20:02:48 To see small pixels move
the-dump 2022-08-20 20:03:17 try using the mosin at mid range
the-dump 2022-08-20 20:03:23 You‚Äôll understand my pain soon enough
the-dump 2022-08-20 20:03:39 I might replace the mosin irons tbh
the-dump 2022-08-20 20:03:47 with another irons
the-dump 2022-08-20 20:03:52 That I can actually see through
bug-reports 2022-08-20 20:10:19 What
bug-reports 2022-08-20 20:15:11 All I see is the camera off centered

the-dump 2022-08-20 20:30:05 Both my guns are pistols
the-dump 2022-08-20 20:30:11 Take a guess how light it is
the-dump 2022-08-20 20:30:30 5
the-dump 2022-08-20 20:31:20 Depending
the-dump 2022-08-20 20:31:36 I can use a shotgun + pistol or shotgun + shotgun
the-dump 2022-08-20 20:32:10 Dragons breath?
the-dump 2022-08-20 20:32:19 smh
the-dump 2022-08-20 20:32:26 shotguns have dragons breath now
the-dump 2022-08-20 20:32:31 It‚Äôs actually quite fun
the-dump 2022-08-20 20:32:41 you properly shoot ‚Äúflames‚Äù
the-dump 2022-08-20 20:33:01 That ergonomics
