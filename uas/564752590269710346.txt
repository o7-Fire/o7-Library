creations-chat 2021-09-27 17:33:49 How does this look for the front of a Space frigate thing, also, should i get rid of the guns or keep them?
creations-chat 2021-09-29 16:21:20 how does this look for the front of a flying destroyer?
creations-chat 2021-09-29 16:23:21 Yes, there is a rail gun with a magazine poking out the front that works. All i need to do is finish the rest of it then figure out how to make it neutrally buoyant so it can fly.
help 2021-09-29 16:24:19 How does one make a build neutrally buoyant so they can turn it into a blimp

creations-chat 2021-12-19 03:54:08 good length for a panzer?
creations-chat 2021-12-19 03:57:29 i recommend using a normal motor at a slow speed like .1 or .075, lock the motors and keep them powered (this should stop them moving on their own), and maybe try to have the rotor systems attached to each other on one beam, then have that beam connected to the main body.
creations-chat 2021-12-19 04:00:25 yes it can cause bugs, but if done right, it can make it more stable. ( for the panzer, its a 1 - 1.25 scale | panzer III / IV
creations-chat 2021-12-19 04:03:04 good internet or try lower the graphics (im good with the physics and the rotors of helicopters, but im trash at making them look good)
creations-chat 2021-12-19 04:05:10 pretty gud
