bot-central 2022-11-28 05:33:53 LEVEL THREE
creations-chat 2023-01-05 01:55:21 Thats a Kv-2
creations-chat 2023-01-28 08:35:27 Bro that tank looks soo amazing
creations-chat 2023-01-28 08:37:52 man, you make it hard to make 1:1 scale tanks
creations-chat 2023-01-28 08:40:03 But you are right, you do need to have an accurate scale and it must depend on how big the actual tank is because tanks come in different sizes
creations-chat 2023-01-28 08:42:59 And thats why I don't put my stuff in creation chat. People tend to be to harsh on others creations, yet to rank yourself as a "good builder". You need others to rate your build and to tell the builder what looks wrong and sometimes what they can do to fix it.
creations-chat 2023-01-28 08:45:02 Also because by builds are kind of if not all just crap so I truly don't deserve to put my builds on this chat because everyone will just say that it looks like crap. Their being honest it is crap but I can see improvement
creations-chat 2023-01-28 08:48:49 Then your just a amazing builder if you can do it, I respect those who can do what I do better or what I can't do at all.
creations-chat 2023-01-28 08:51:24 If I posted my build, there would be so much exposed motor lock because I just can't hide it. Not because I am lazy. But because I am just not that good at the game lol
creations-chat 2023-01-28 08:53:44 Lol, yeah I've seen some like that too. But I only see it in mini builds xD
creations-chat 2023-01-28 08:56:28 Yeah your right. The only problem that I have with building is that I don't quite understand "Camera locking". I tried doing it a few times but it kind of just make my build awfully disastrous lol
creations-chat 2023-01-28 09:02:20 Oh, Because I am decent with angle locking and motor locking. I just need to experiment more on my builds I'm guessing
creations-chat 2023-01-28 09:15:38 Yeah sorry for the weird angle, not sure if you wanted like a side angle of it or not
creations-chat 2023-01-28 09:18:40 Yeah, I see so much of those builds in server. Yet I never see the perfect one. It is either too big or too small or too little details, ect
creations-chat 2023-01-28 09:20:56 I mainly build tanks but tried one time building a plane but it was so terrible, so little details on that plane I build but I have a bt-42 lol
creations-chat 2023-01-28 09:24:14 Which one? The awful plane or the bt-42?
creations-chat 2023-01-28 09:26:32 okay
creations-chat 2023-01-28 20:28:56 For some reason I get the vibe of a Messerschmitt Bf 110, But looks super great!
creations-chat 2023-01-28 20:31:16 Ahh damn mb wrong plane Me-262
creations-chat 2023-01-28 23:54:48 Yummy, wish my tanks could have a coat of chocolate and gingerbread üòã
creations-chat 2023-01-29 01:26:55 lol, you remind me of when I did my first motor locking. It was super challenging for me. But at the end, it was super surprising how all my motor locking looked decent.
creations-chat 2023-02-04 09:38:02 Super Poggers build
