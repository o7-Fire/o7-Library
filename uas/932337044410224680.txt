bug-reports 2022-10-06 00:20:49 Sometimes my motor 2 on my guided missles or the currently building minions turns in a way that it spins and it doesnt move with the cursor then. Its not on toggle nor inverted or anything, just 10% with 1 speed. Fun to watch but not fun to use in pvp or testing upgrades.
bug-reports 2022-10-06 23:55:42 How about wait for a answer, eventually it'll come up. Saying dont play doesnt help either, just let someone that knows a fix to the bug or let them know they're fixing it if its at all being fixed or even known.
bug-reports 2022-10-07 00:10:52 How long has it been in between those four times and complants?
bug-reports 2022-10-07 00:55:06 Alright, sounds reasonable.
help 2022-10-24 04:46:58 Is there a way to go to another pvp server? Everytime I try to go to another pvp server it only goes to the same server and I dont think theres a option to go to several servers of pvp as far as I know. There is a lagger that goes by the name of ChrisHadField0 and me and another person that recently friended me are trying to find another pvp server.
help 2022-10-25 05:53:18 Apparently my friend found a button at the flying island while we're streaming on youtube, wtf is call owner?
help 2022-10-25 06:17:08 I dont have their perspective in it, Im streaming in my side and he found it past the rick roll picture or smth inside one of the silo entrance like thingies. Apparently it also disappeared or smth. Im still waiting for another friend of mine to check if there is multiple buttons or just that one.

help 2022-10-25 14:29:07 Ikr doesn't sound right.
help 2022-10-25 14:46:10 I'll go look for it, I don't really know how to do timestamps and I ended up wasting 3 hours because I forgot to turn it public.

help 2022-10-25 14:56:25 I dint have the slightest clue, I just managed to get it working with wing panels and some mechanic that allows you to do a steep turn under unknown conditions.
help 2022-10-25 14:58:53 He said it teleported away. I could try to get him to share his screen so that we can see the call owner button in settings he claims he got.
help 2022-10-25 14:59:17 We aren't in the same server though so it might be hard to do so.
help 2022-10-25 15:08:55 Lol
help 2022-11-13 20:30:32 Can anyone help me with my carrier plane? The controls on my carrier plane's manually set wing panels arent working and I been trying to find a loophole to this since this morning.
help 2022-11-13 20:44:56 My pilot seats arent working on anything that isnt my main build, they seem to only work on my propellars rn for some reason.
