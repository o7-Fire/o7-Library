He shakes the thugs for money, once I think I saw him shake a bunny.
Sometimes he shakes me other times he fakes me.
He is very shady I do not know if he's a lady.
My mother makes him shake pies at least it's better than him shaking guys.

creations-chat 2023-07-14 19:53:41 the tail wings and any parts that dont really matter are done lazy
creations-chat 2023-07-14 19:57:02 this was mostly just a test bed to test hypermanuvrability at 2k+ speeds, redundancy, trimming, and reducing sliping without thrust vectoring.
creations-chat 2023-07-14 20:01:53 im trying to develop the techonlogys so i can out tryhard the tryhard, without trying hard
creations-chat 2023-07-14 20:12:06 the cherry on top is it requires mouse and a remapped flight stick to fly optimaly
creations-chat 2023-07-14 20:28:27 ok in a dive the wings can handle up to 4k speed before they start to slip when pulling up 90 deg, so i can realistically double the speed, the only issue is i would need 3-4 times torque the current engines output to keep the insane acceleration (torque does not equal speed)
creations-chat 2023-07-14 20:51:14 i dont make things that look good, i make things that kill good
