the-dump 2021-06-03 04:29:53 these edible aint shit
the-dump 2021-06-04 02:52:52 I hear it's amazing when the famous purple stuffed worm in flap-jaw space with the tuning fork does a raw blink on Hara-Kiri Rock. I need scissors! 61!
the-dump 2021-06-04 02:53:17 gee, i wonder
the-dump 2021-06-04 02:54:06 imagine getting fat

This was made by the skinny gang

the-dump 2022-09-14 12:54:53 How many people like making somewhat unorthodox vehicles? Like not necessarily planes and cars with a weird shape, but it's piloted or it functions in a way that's not seen often?
the-dump 2022-09-14 12:59:19 Oh cool!
the-dump 2022-09-14 12:59:24 I really like that design
the-dump 2022-09-14 13:00:27 I don't have pictures of it, but I have a hovercraft of some sort that floats above the ground, but can't really fly, although it's really fun to drive
the-dump 2022-09-14 13:00:52 I kept improving the functions and the design until I perfected it
the-dump 2022-09-14 13:01:56 Getting the weight distribution to work was a pain, because it would go forward or backwards when still, but I fine tuned it *juuuuust* perfectly to not do that anymore
the-dump 2022-09-14 13:02:16 I even added a self destruct and ejector seat with parachute
the-dump 2022-09-14 13:03:38 I also tried my hand at a vehicle with only two wheels, placed horizontally. It looks like what I wanted, but it's completely unstable, and I needed cameras to act as the "third wheel"
the-dump 2022-09-14 13:04:21 Completely unable to go forward in a straight line with it
the-dump 2022-09-14 13:04:51 I like that design, very nice and sleek, but also very angular
the-dump 2022-09-14 13:06:54 Oh wow, very very nice
the-dump 2022-09-14 13:07:01 Magnificent
the-dump 2022-09-14 13:08:07 Have you ever done something with a cockpit windshield that opens and closes?
the-dump 2022-09-14 13:08:55 I tried my hand at it, but ended up not having all the wedges that I needed, so I scrapped it
the-dump 2022-09-14 13:09:26 Kinda like this, thats what I mean
