creations-chat 2020-01-31 04:59:33 <@499396323741794304> try corner wedges or remove the half block under the triangle wedges and replace it with an upside down triangle wedge

creations-chat 2020-01-31 05:07:10 And a heads up, put your landing gear in the wings
creations-chat 2020-01-31 05:07:29 It will remove that look and it would more or less resemble a plane
creations-chat 2020-01-31 05:11:42 Check in <#384021699466756107> I pinged you

creations-chat 2020-10-26 08:34:11 Flush locked door, detachable model
creations-chat 2020-10-26 08:35:19 Locks the door in, detaches using the disconnector, and launches it out using the two pistons, Works with any level of detailed surface
creations-chat 2020-10-26 08:36:43 Only issue is, you cannot launch when the main body is anchored
creations-chat 2020-10-26 09:27:46 Update on detachable door, for larger scale projects like my yacht, it's preferable to use a booster instead of a piston setup to push it out
creations-chat 2020-10-26 09:28:48 Interior
creations-chat 2020-10-26 10:31:39 Anyone know how to make a flush door without locking? In other words, push a block outside of a frame with no gap, and bring it back in
creations-chat 2020-10-26 10:34:13 The blocks are angled, so I can't use 0.9 blocks either <:Thonk:509498568982134816>

creations-chat 2020-12-02 06:13:03 Up to you, I just saw some dude driving a senna around so I decided to make the same car
creations-chat 2020-12-02 06:20:14 Trialing some rim ideas, trying not to make it look like ugh well, a controversial symbol
creations-chat 2020-12-02 06:21:47 I'm either going for the first one, or the third one from the left, probably the first but if y'all have any other ideas I'm open to hear em
creations-chat 2020-12-02 06:52:48 <@524324517431214100> it wasn't Intentional, and it more resembles a plus sign than anything else
