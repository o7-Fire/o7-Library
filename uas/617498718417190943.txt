bug-reports 2022-01-05 23:23:07 ik but its stupid af when the game is like " you know what, your moter locking is cringe" and yeets you into the void faster then the speed of light
bug-reports 2022-01-05 23:48:46 16 id rather use "old words" that everybody knows then something that is new or boring
creations-chat 2022-01-07 01:44:15 its realistic tho

creations-chat 2022-02-23 02:53:26 How many likes is needed to pin a creation
creations-chat 2022-02-23 02:56:12 
creations-chat 2022-02-23 03:00:04 I made the first ever "large" scale nuke
creations-chat 2022-02-23 03:11:42 Show me it then
creations-chat 2022-02-23 03:22:50 Thats tiny af in comparison, u can tell cause the spread of the smoke
creations-chat 2022-02-23 03:24:57 Yeah but uniquely large
creations-chat 2022-02-23 03:27:00 I plan to make mine much larger, rn the top only reaches 250
creations-chat 2022-02-23 03:29:14 I Wana say u make a realistic musroom cloud with its top at 250 altitude
creations-chat 2022-02-23 03:31:47 U said low effort, it must be easy to make then I assume
creations-chat 2022-02-23 03:35:17 Ikr I make a "new" technology for makeing big musroom clouds and the no lifers makes excuses to Raise their ego
creations-chat 2022-02-23 03:37:19 Tf u mean I was asking about pins, and how I made the first (record) large scale musroom cloud and u guys get toxic
creations-chat 2022-02-23 03:40:09 I have 179 upvotes and most people don't even get over 100 so I guessed 200 upvotes is enough for pin or somting, but sorry I was asking a question next te I should just go fuck my self ig
creations-chat 2022-02-23 03:42:10 I literly asked a question about if they still do pins for a certain number of upvotes idc about what u think of it
creations-chat 2022-02-23 03:44:12 It's almost as if u asked the question because I didn't know, how tf I'm I suppose to know that

creations-chat 2022-05-25 18:09:50 It should be alot less since this is a chat talking about creations, not the actual creations channel 

It's stupid af to limit the speed of chat in thus chat when it's about helping people
creations-chat 2022-05-25 18:13:43 Well maybe if the mods Would stop  arguments instead of punishing everyone for the actions of the few, this chat can be a chat not just a place for arguments over builds

And arguments mean arguments not just debates 
I needed to clarify that cause some people are stupid af
creations-chat 2022-05-25 18:18:49 Well if for instance; I would be asking about recommendations for a build, I would ask in here
When a 6 hour slow mode would be active the people won't be able to respond
creations-chat 2022-05-25 18:24:22 The problem with that is that it would have to not be about negitive feedbacks cause then it will be (I can't find a better way to say this) a circle j**k
creations-chat 2022-05-25 18:28:50 At least ur honest causes some of the mods treat it as a job
creations-chat 2022-05-25 18:31:30 I'm in multiple servers that if it gets leaked that it would start an investigation by the fbi, due to the ironic shitposting
creations-chat 2022-05-25 18:34:58 I vote for anarchy

creations-chat 2022-06-20 23:40:36 almost 1.1k, still ridiculous the amount of parts
creations-chat 2022-06-20 23:42:42 no lol its angle locking and the coplexity of my flight controll system which u can see here https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/384021699466756107/987499625097355345
creations-chat 2022-06-20 23:45:31 its inside the heli, of corse u cant see it
creations-chat 2022-06-20 23:48:23 its not smh, i can show u more in depth
its not the system its self that has lots of blocks, its the part where i canot touch the moving parts with the heli or else the thing breaks
creations-chat 2022-06-20 23:50:26 yeah no crap, i used lots of blocks incaseing the system, without touching it, meaning i used lots of small parts
creations-chat 2022-06-20 23:52:31 plus the moterlocking and the angle locking and the small details yes 1.1k is reasonable

bruh u stupid, u dont get that i used lots of round parts
creations-chat 2022-06-20 23:54:34 see how its smooth? that causes lots of blocks cause there are not cylinder beams
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/987911189621260318/988592863422062602/unknown.png
creations-chat 2022-06-20 23:57:50 That's without seeing the back side
creations-chat 2022-06-21 00:00:18 Plus why are you trying to prove that my 1.1k block build isn't 1.1k blocks
Why would I lie about that, I wouldn't spend extra time just to place more blocks than I need
creations-chat 2022-06-21 03:06:49 i mean semi realistic by how it flys, its not propeled like a plane nor is it super fast and it also flys from the tilt of the entire heli
creations-chat 2022-06-21 03:09:23 its semi because realistic controls dont work on a small scale
but the controls work realistically
creations-chat 2022-06-21 03:11:24 the squashplate controls the pitch and roll, its how it helis irl move, im using the same controls to fly

creations-chat 2022-07-26 02:33:28 idk its an 8 cylinder
its essential a v8
creations-chat 2022-07-26 02:36:58 the problem with that is that the hover engine will try to push the engine down so you have to counter act that with a piston going in the opposite direction synced with the first one, or else it would either not move or fly

creations-chat 2022-07-26 20:34:56 this is the trasmission, there is no gears in plane crazy it it relies on the angle of the 90 degree turn for "gears"
creations-chat 2022-07-26 20:36:58 bro i dare u to try to make a gear in plane crazy, my thing has 2 "gears" forward and reverse, so techicaly a transmission
creations-chat 2022-07-26 20:39:37 irl you use a gear to move the rotational force perpendicularly, in plane crazy you cant do that so i used a moveable 45 degree angle to change movment direction
creations-chat 2022-07-26 20:41:45 also friction dosnt have enough torque in plane crazy now shut
creations-chat 2022-07-26 20:43:47 it isnt a transmission but functions as one, its not possible to make a transmission with out gears, so whats your point?
creations-chat 2022-07-26 20:45:53 THANK YOU, its not possible to make accurate so i have to re-invent the reverse "gear"

<@588596347272167456> literly shut up, you are now trying to prove your failing point by hypothisising somting that i already did in a simple manor

creations-chat 2022-08-09 16:02:59 Also it not a mechanical mech XD, I'm guessing most of the moters have separate key binding (very cringe)
creations-chat 2022-08-09 16:07:19 I mean normal mechs are cool but an anime girl ðŸ—¿ ðŸ’€

<@581500505759416340> my mechs w for forward 
And s for backwards

No unnessasary flipping between keys
creations-chat 2022-08-09 16:10:23 Honestly
creations-chat 2022-08-09 16:12:47 Also why not just use 2 buttons for locking
One for rotating other for disconnecting
creations-chat 2022-08-09 16:14:49 My mechs use 2 buttons ðŸ’€
creations-chat 2022-08-12 03:21:24 <@932391203037667392>  it's pretty good except the the fact that:
The wings are supposed to be slightly v shaped,
Goofy ahh flag and cockpit
Also the engine is hollow ðŸ—¿
creations-chat 2022-08-17 15:38:04 its very dificult to compact it
also less compact = more tourque
creations-chat 2022-08-17 15:43:15 well by unfinished they mean more like a plane without wings not the small details

creations-chat 2022-08-20 14:29:32 <@642324788429324301> I gotta ask, do u plan to put that into a car?

Because there's a small issue, the game doesn't have equal and opposite reactions so a v8 will function like a hover drive and fly up
creations-chat 2022-08-20 14:34:22 Now that u mention it, I rewached the vid and see that u have 2 power strokes, counter acting the hover engine
creations-chat 2022-08-20 14:36:32 I might but tbh u and I and a few others are some of the only people with fully functional engines, so I just want to see how u did it, so I can improve mine
creations-chat 2022-08-20 14:40:37 Sure ig but I already know much about how to build engines but we can learn from eachother maybe
creations-chat 2022-08-20 14:43:29 Ima keep in touch with you cause I'm trying to upgrade my mechanical car
creations-chat 2022-08-21 17:26:50 <@842760720125788172> people are downvoting because first of all: that's not 2 cylinders
secondly: ugly 
third: that's not any type of engine for instance a v8 or a boxer
creations-chat 2022-08-21 17:46:02 The top since it probably have multiple strokes

The probably is emphasized
creations-chat 2022-08-21 17:55:49 make it work then
creations-chat 2022-09-12 20:41:29 tbh its super simple u need one for yaw and one for pitch
creations-chat 2022-09-12 20:44:43 its a frictionless control, it uses hover thrusters to form a differential in the opposite direction of where u point it, causing the whole thing to turn without the use of wing pannles and is mouse controlled

basically the spring part induces some dampening, the hover thrusters make it turn, the  2 is inverted, and the "walls" provide something for the hover thrusters to detect
creations-chat 2022-09-13 13:46:20 U can beatly even see the build and its not even good
help 2022-11-07 15:11:06 Kinda but I gave up on PC
help 2022-11-07 15:11:16 But I still know how it works
help 2022-11-07 15:12:47 Basicly u have to sync the pushing or compressing force with the position of the piston
help 2022-11-07 15:34:55 Btw the people on YouTube tend to have inefficient, or un tuned (hover thruster flings car)

creations-chat 2023-01-12 15:29:07 A 51 block perfect circle without moterlock?
creations-chat 2023-01-25 02:15:36 its either high rpm with weird phaseing glitches or low rpm
creations-chat 2023-01-25 02:18:29 it has an autoloader, it can load like 10 "bullets" per second
creations-chat 2023-01-25 02:28:45 the auto loader pushes the "bullets" infront of a "bolt" that pushes the "bullet" into an individual barrel, beyond a point where it can interact with a magnet pushing it out

basicly, you see the back-middle part with springs, the point of that is to basically make a tilted cam groove that pushes the balls with pistons forward at a certain point, engaging the magnets (firing)

As u see from this, I have a piston extending from both sides going in opisite directions at the same to to counteract the force of a hover thruster
