creations-chat 2022-06-18 01:26:51 thank you, i grow super insecure very fast due to me always having doubt over my creativity and comparing how good it is compared to the experts, also the slow mode is indeed very slow

creations-chat 2023-02-08 03:21:39 i have no knowledge how to function a 5000 block build because for one ive built nothing but cars or things under 500 blocks xd
creations-chat 2023-04-03 00:51:35 I made a workable chess but its kinda boring cause the towers are just worded and looks like checkers and the machine is insanely slow
creations-chat 2023-04-03 03:03:46 hi
creations-chat 2023-04-03 03:07:54 oka
creations-chat 2023-04-05 21:04:21 Scuffed and slow chess in plane crazy, because why not (updated a bit) https://streamable.com/wvyjn7  (chess.com? never heard of it) i will put rules and basics of chess probably like how the pieces move
creations-chat 2023-04-05 21:09:52 Very scuffed because the average round if people even have patiences is 20-30 minutes
help 2023-06-18 05:58:06 Was there an update im unaware of that broke my chess build? It used to stay in its original place now it clips out of its original place https://streamable.com/ck88vh
help 2023-06-18 05:59:23 It was supposed to be a grabbing mechanism with the system of a 3d printer but now it clips out of its place
help 2023-06-18 06:11:19 Aghhhh did they add a feature where things clip out when theyre unanchored inside a hallowed build
help 2023-06-18 06:11:28 It wont fix itself
help 2023-06-18 06:18:32 Its joever
help 2023-06-18 06:43:41 I think jetpacks are a little broken
help 2023-06-18 06:44:00 You fly with it once and you get flung out of the map (at least for me)
