bug-reports 2021-04-14 01:20:39 ok so ive been waiting for a month to see if this bug gets patched but it seems to not have, im unable to use any weapons in pvp mode other then guns. like all my vehicles cant shoot missiles (new and old) and this only happens with simple movement, so for example if i use a turret that just rotates then it doesnt shoot any missiles unless im perfectly still. *reposted from <#384021699466756107>*
