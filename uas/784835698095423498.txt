the-dump 2020-12-07 17:33:56 i maed this
the-dump 2020-12-07 17:34:05 did
the-dump 2020-12-07 17:34:24 see?
the-dump 2020-12-07 17:34:29 i make the reload
the-dump 2020-12-07 17:34:47 thank you, much appreciated üëç
the-dump 2020-12-07 17:35:33 thanks üëç
the-dump 2020-12-07 17:36:04 lmaooooo, ive made an animation similar to that. i did it with the Deagle XiX
the-dump 2020-12-07 17:36:37 let me load it up
the-dump 2020-12-07 17:37:16 i made the animation about a month ago, so its jank
the-dump 2020-12-07 17:37:53 gonna update it a bit
the-dump 2020-12-07 18:08:51 https://gyazo.com/a44abc1711f21d88948bc8f0d8b227d3 well thats now how you're supposed to reload
the-dump 2020-12-07 20:51:40 i have 2 different reload animations, tell me which one is better
the-dump 2020-12-07 20:51:41 https://gyazo.com/d6d5b0542ff8d30b84694ce7e19371b0
the-dump 2020-12-07 20:51:57 https://gyazo.com/a51e69680d0de939efd52172a332537d
the-dump 2020-12-07 20:53:16 you flick it fast to where the mag clips the mag-well thus spinning like that
the-dump 2020-12-07 20:53:44 foxy is already a 'robot' cease
the-dump 2020-12-07 20:55:08 that mag flick reload is also seen on the HK416 in phantom forces, but the mag is flicked to the right, and not the left
the-dump 2020-12-07 20:56:20 idk, i just feel like i could get the 2nd animation to work if the mag isnt flicked as hard
the-dump 2020-12-07 20:57:00 yea thats what im saying
the-dump 2020-12-07 21:04:21 you cant do that on a Scar-L,H
the-dump 2020-12-07 21:04:42 you cant just smack the bolt on a Scar-H
the-dump 2020-12-07 21:06:52 well the inspiration i got from was just pulling the bolt back and releasing it
the-dump 2020-12-07 21:10:17 https://gyazo.com/87450746659690cd11f92943e14828c6 better?
the-dump 2020-12-07 21:10:51 yea
the-dump 2020-12-07 21:11:32 well the person who made the animation originally did an empty reload and the bolt was forward
the-dump 2020-12-07 21:11:37 i can change it if needed
the-dump 2020-12-07 21:22:00 https://gyazo.com/7511e04bf8844ac5cefbeb0749c91189
the-dump 2020-12-07 21:22:19 good
the-dump 2020-12-07 21:23:36 ***its a damn lego game, every aspect of it doesnt need to match to realism. if it was to be realistic, the character wouldn't be able to hold the weapon due to its hands being literal lego pieces***
the-dump 2020-12-07 21:24:35 fuck.
the-dump 2020-12-07 21:24:38 no.
the-dump 2020-12-07 21:26:14 i regret every moment of rejoining this server
the-dump 2020-12-07 21:26:38 regular roblox stuff
the-dump 2020-12-07 21:27:08 i easy weld it with moon animator tools, then use roblox rig animation to perform
the-dump 2020-12-07 21:27:33 probably better than stylis phantom forces reloads
the-dump 2020-12-07 21:27:35 üòâ
the-dump 2020-12-07 21:28:19 you'll see when you play their games, half of the reloads are nice, but some of them look robotic as frick
the-dump 2020-12-07 21:29:28 all mags are in 2020
the-dump 2020-12-07 21:29:58 mags are rocket powered in 2020, deal with it üòé
the-dump 2020-12-07 21:30:32 ebay
the-dump 2020-12-07 21:32:46 oil
the-dump 2020-12-07 21:51:25 depends on the viewmodel and plugin
the-dump 2020-12-07 21:52:20 i cant remember off the top of my head
the-dump 2020-12-07 21:55:11 sometimes, or my friend will do it for me
the-dump 2020-12-07 22:24:15 i said reee, yeesh
the-dump 2020-12-07 22:24:37 https://gyazo.com/825ff4cc146326c21d6e8b195e4be70d *sigh* *ree*
the-dump 2020-12-07 22:24:50 magazine is less of a rocket
the-dump 2020-12-07 23:06:08 nice

the-dump 2020-12-08 17:10:19 yea thats my sniper viewmodel
the-dump 2020-12-08 17:54:31 much hurt, such pew

the-dump 2020-12-08 22:00:43 https://gyazo.com/8149922d93720e445551912c39285e07 k, smoother it is
the-dump 2020-12-08 23:04:58 added audio, will improve upon soon
the-dump 2020-12-08 23:10:36 <@!621817208313479248> dont question the flick of the mag
the-dump 2020-12-08 23:13:52 ikr, you see the similar flick on the HK416 in phantom forces, mag gets flicked out
the-dump 2020-12-08 23:16:35 Scar-H considered an AR stylis format?
the-dump 2020-12-08 23:19:51 thats more than 45 but ok
the-dump 2020-12-08 23:20:41 plus i put a lot of force into the flick, so
the-dump 2020-12-08 23:25:03 plus its only a lego game, why should such tomfoolary have to be at such realism
the-dump 2020-12-08 23:28:01 sometimes not <:m_:778994206948589638>
the-dump 2020-12-09 22:34:28 
the-dump 2020-12-12 16:46:11 my mag ran out of gun
the-dump 2020-12-12 19:11:31 because i can
the-dump 2020-12-13 23:49:36 first time using viewmodels that make use of fingers and segmented arms, please go gentle on me ü•∫
the-dump 2020-12-13 23:50:16 yes
the-dump 2020-12-13 23:50:28 bad business made a bad move by using that lmao
the-dump 2020-12-13 23:50:43 <:OmegaTroll:626841385118597152> get it?
the-dump 2020-12-14 16:07:21 good holding pose?
the-dump 2020-12-14 16:07:32 or would a 2nd hand for stability be nice?
the-dump 2020-12-14 16:08:27 hello
the-dump 2020-12-14 16:08:58 oh ok, i kinda went for how i'd hold a pistol
the-dump 2020-12-14 16:11:01 i based it off of how i hold a hand gun, in this case i only have an M1911 BB gun but for a G17 i'd still hold it the same pretty much
the-dump 2020-12-14 16:11:38 yea, but i guess it can boil down to comfort
the-dump 2020-12-14 16:12:04 preference, however i looked at G17 recoil and there isnt much to be honest
the-dump 2020-12-14 16:13:49 anyones wrist would hurt after firing plenty of rounds
the-dump 2020-12-14 16:15:57 i have a spork, all of your arguments are invalid
the-dump 2020-12-14 20:30:40 
the-dump 2021-04-28 21:21:37 lol
