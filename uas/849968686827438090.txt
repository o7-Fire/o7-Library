creations-chat 2021-09-04 13:01:32 Give me feedback on my creations
creations-chat 2021-09-04 13:04:49 If you think it is trash, I’m open to suggestions. Because I have to admit that Rodan’s head is not shaped very well and ghidorah’s neck and head is kinda not thought out. The slave 1 spaceship’s name may be offending but deal with it since it’s from Star Wars and the name was recently changed to Boba Fetts spaceship I think. The functions aren’t showed mainly because it’s an image and there are button as I’m mobile. This is the explanation for the creations.
creations-chat 2021-09-04 13:07:57 Well, any suggestions at least? I could remake it.
creations-chat 2021-09-04 13:10:13 Oh no, well. I will try to remake it and post it again. I did say that it’s similar but it’s not Slave 1. I can make it green, red and the same as the spaceship, if I did intend to make it the same. It would have the same colours, same if not similar shape and the same modifications made to the spaceship.
creations-chat 2021-09-04 13:13:52 I have to admit tho, the shape sure looks cursed a little.
creations-chat 2021-09-04 13:16:12 I just said, a land vehicle, not the tumbler
creations-chat 2021-09-04 13:18:51 No, uh, the shape is different and the colour is also different
creations-chat 2021-09-04 13:21:06 I am learning a lot. But what’s a pcc?
creations-chat 2021-09-04 13:23:39 Ok, well. What’s fun to make?
creations-chat 2021-09-04 13:27:04 Ok, I did a helicopter creation
creations-chat 2021-09-04 13:32:08 ?
creations-chat 2021-09-04 13:34:56 I’m gonna take another screenshot for the tank
creations-chat 2021-09-04 13:44:10 Well, now I’m not sure why it’s bad.
creations-chat 2021-09-04 13:47:46 I don’t remember an Abrams being nuclear powered
creations-chat 2021-09-04 13:50:25 Motor lock for tanks?
creations-chat 2021-09-04 14:00:44 Oh thanks

creations-chat 2021-09-04 23:20:50 Yes
creations-chat 2021-09-04 23:37:47 What’s that
creations-chat 2021-09-05 01:59:14 Anyone have feedback for my Godzilla 1954?
creations-chat 2021-09-05 02:43:11 Idk, looks cool enough I guess.
creations-chat 2021-09-05 02:46:09 Hey, could anyone give me feedback on my godzilla 1954?
creations-chat 2021-09-05 02:48:12 It’s in creations.
creations-chat 2021-09-05 02:51:00 This is my Godzilla 1954, I see my mistakes now.
creations-chat 2021-09-05 02:53:21 I mean, downvotes are usually more common. Because you will probably still get downvotes and even if it looks good in your eyes.
creations-chat 2021-09-05 02:57:37 Why is that guy in <#384025409945337856> posting someone’s build instead of his?
creations-chat 2021-09-05 02:59:39 He also posted a reference image which is against the rules.
creations-chat 2021-09-05 03:10:13 What
creations-chat 2021-09-05 03:13:31 using tutorials is frowned upon on. I’m not sure about using a part of it but it’s basically still copying.
creations-chat 2021-09-05 06:40:34 I thought Sam was ok, but yea. Low effort build.
creations-chat 2021-11-11 05:49:58 Any feedbacks on the ITT? I kind of need help with how I can improve the suspensions below to allow for a smoother ride
creations-chat 2021-11-11 06:00:51 Oh, the paint?
creations-chat 2021-11-11 06:02:57 That’s just a metal texture, I haven’t painted it yet, but I’ll work on it.
creations-chat 2021-11-27 10:53:09 Can anyone help give me suggestions on my ship to help it balance?
creations-chat 2021-11-27 10:56:46 It be capsizing all the time when i move forward, I tried to use helium, jet engines and propellers upwards, but none of them worked. I also tried to make a keel but it didn’t work either. I used pontoons but same thing happened.
creations-chat 2021-11-27 10:58:54 I did use helium and set to Center. I also used ballast under the whole ship to act as a hull, but made it 0.15 so that it could float, I’ll try placing it to 10
creations-chat 2021-11-27 11:47:40 It’s still capsizing even tho I put ballast to 10. Less worse now tho.
creations-chat 2021-11-27 11:50:43 It does float, it’s just that it capsizes when it moves
help 2021-12-15 11:27:34 You could use a wedge that covers only the top
help 2021-12-15 11:27:39 It’s not a full block
help 2021-12-15 11:27:45 It’s a half block corner wedge
help 2021-12-15 11:28:40 I forgotten if it was the up, or down half block corner wedge which covers the top
help 2021-12-15 11:28:54 But I have put your options to these 2 only
creations-chat 2021-12-31 10:10:03 Oh, I see, I’ll try that real quick
creations-chat 2021-12-31 10:12:05 Lemme just delete my upload real quick so that I can work on the egg mobile while adding other details, and that too
creations-chat 2021-12-31 10:18:33 Ah dam.
creations-chat 2021-12-31 10:20:46 Hey, I’m thinking of using the hover thruster to replace the sign text, seems to work best since the text blocks the yellow circle emoji
creations-chat 2021-12-31 10:46:17 OMG, the egg mobile improved in control when I added the extra designs
creations-chat 2021-12-31 10:58:18 I tried a wrecking ball, weight pulled it down too much and I tried adding helium. However, the wrecking ball affected the egg mobile’s movement by a lot, I’ll try working on the wrecking ball still with other methods.
creations-chat 2021-12-31 11:00:25 Won’t that ruin the texture tho?
creations-chat 2021-12-31 11:02:31 Huh, I’ll try that right now and post it once I’m done, what do you think of the egg mobile now tho?
creations-chat 2021-12-31 11:05:17 : D
creations-chat 2021-12-31 11:26:42 Alright, I added the wrecking ball, took me a while
creations-chat 2022-01-01 02:08:19 I didn’t expect to see my egg mobile to get 100+ votes
creations-chat 2022-01-01 02:10:47 The hammer with rockets is quite a cool concept, you don’t necessarily need to switch it out with something.
creations-chat 2022-01-01 02:21:06 Looks really detailed
creations-chat 2022-01-01 04:59:47 I build everything on mobile

bot-central 2022-01-01 07:14:29 Okeh
creations-chat 2022-01-01 08:21:09 <@!758208036631347230> HERE
creations-chat 2022-01-01 08:23:14 Uh, should I add the egg dragoon to connect with my egg mobile?
creations-chat 2022-01-01 08:25:35 OKEH
creations-chat 2022-01-01 12:24:36 I’m sort of having a problem trying to make the egg dragoon
creations-chat 2022-01-01 12:26:46 It’s gonna be really hard considering it’s gonna have arms and legs, together with 4 extra joints, that’s gonna have a lot of controls which would really make it a little confusing for me
creations-chat 2022-01-01 16:01:41 Is it just me, or does the arm proportions seem a little off for the egg dragoon?
creations-chat 2022-01-01 16:13:10 Uh, any feedback on the proportions for my egg dragoon? The paint and shape isn’t complete so I’m open to opinions on what can be changed.
creations-chat 2022-01-02 01:34:19 Oh, you’re was talking about tutorials. You’re still kinda limited by tutorial builds considering that some tutorial builds are really mediocre or just repetitive, this could limit your imagination and number of blocks you can put on the tutorial frame work before it collapses as a whole. However, if you’re not using anyone else’s framework but you’re own, it would be easier to alter and modify your creation to be improved. And teamwork? That really sounds like an excuse for using a tutorial because you couldn’t understand physics behind something, if you think about it, it’s not really teamwork considering anyone could have done what you did, making you seem obsolete.
creations-chat 2022-01-02 01:41:56 I’m short, what I’m saying, bad excuse, more cons than pros if you’re in this discord, and also because you’re bad.
creations-chat 2022-01-02 02:02:24 Making something that far exceeds someone’s expectations is good, but no matter what you do, it’s basically still copying. Unless the changes you added outshines the tutorial itself, I don’t get why you use tutorials as your framework then.
creations-chat 2022-01-02 02:04:40 : D
I can’t wait, must be really good
creations-chat 2022-01-02 02:15:49 Not bad at all, seems better than what I expected, just change the shell, but don’t deviate too much from the plane design irl. The interior is really good too.
creations-chat 2022-01-02 06:29:26 Im working on the egg dragoon, which has one major problem currently. The problem being that the hands being at the front cause the egg dragoon to tilt forward, causing the mech to go into a nose dive or spin like sonic.
creations-chat 2022-01-02 06:31:33 Seems cool, I don’t really know what you could add since I don’t build these kinds of stuff
creations-chat 2022-01-02 06:41:28 Pls give me some ideas to fix my egg dragoon

it’s my previous text
creations-chat 2022-01-02 07:26:00 Dam, you saying number 2 and 3 made me rethink I how build stuff, thanks for the helpful advice.
creations-chat 2022-01-02 07:28:34 It’s an iPad
creations-chat 2022-01-02 07:30:51 
creations-chat 2022-01-02 07:32:58 Their rear isn’t the same, and most boats are shaped like that
creations-chat 2022-01-02 07:38:03 How to prevent the mech from tilting a little to one side, like balancing?
Don’t mention helium blocks, I’m not using those.
creations-chat 2022-01-02 07:40:11 It’s suppose to fly, but when it does, it tilts a little.
creations-chat 2022-01-02 07:42:39 Use the search button and check mentions on yourself
creations-chat 2022-01-02 07:49:21 CARL BOT!
creations-chat 2022-01-02 07:51:57 I always post different stuff
creations-chat 2022-01-02 07:54:33 Ye, a lot of the military vehicles
creations-chat 2022-01-02 07:58:31 Well, one cool space ship got a lot of upvotes
creations-chat 2022-01-02 08:01:08 Yea true, I only saw that when my egg mobile got way more upvotes than my previous builds, and most of my previous builds weren’t military and got a hec lot of downvotes too.
creations-chat 2022-01-02 08:04:23 Yes, very cool. Kinda boring building the same thing over and over again though. I immediately got bored of building military stuff after a few builds of them.
creations-chat 2022-01-02 08:06:28 Thomas the creepy pasta.
creations-chat 2022-01-02 08:10:51 You got any more nuts?
Go make me some.
creations-chat 2022-01-02 08:15:08 UH
creations-chat 2022-01-02 08:36:12 HOW DID YOU MAKE THOSE!!!!???
creations-chat 2022-01-02 08:38:20 IT FEELS SO UNREAL! NICE!!!!!!!!
creations-chat 2022-01-02 10:48:28 I honestly do think my egg dragoon is incomplete, but I can’t really think of any functional improvements, so I’ll just keep it this way till something comes to mind.
creations-chat 2022-01-02 10:51:34 OH SHOOT, I REALISED MINE IS BASICALLY WIP
creations-chat 2022-01-02 11:02:20 I think the egg dragoon from sonic unleashed is harder than the egg dragoon in sonic forces, so I’ll build sonic force’s egg dragoon
creations-chat 2022-01-02 13:13:14 What can I improve on?
creations-chat 2022-01-02 13:15:23 Alright, what can replace the wing units with?

I dunno about the cutter since I need it to do major damage

Reference is the egg dragoon

creations-chat 2022-03-13 04:47:54 YEA, That would be a really funny joke, let’s try that.
creations-chat 2022-04-23 03:56:18 https://streamable.com/2xs61u

How can I improve?
creations-chat 2022-04-23 03:59:59 It’s based off the the tumbler’s tank-like shape, the Arkham knight’s Batman(game) batmobile. However, I just made it more bulkier and like a tank. Colour scheme is inspired by “The Batman” Robert’s batmobile colour scheme.
creations-chat 2022-04-23 04:03:01 Can I get any feedback on my build?
creations-chat 2022-04-23 04:05:24 What?
