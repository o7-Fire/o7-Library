creations-chat 2023-01-27 03:45:18 I can't imagine how Unmanned Jet Fighter can dogfight? Like how they fight and how was their techniques, strategy...
creations-chat 2023-01-27 03:51:37 Just how i think, if unmanned Jet Fighters are programmed and trained for fighting this will have "Advantages" and "Disadvantages", why? Because if they are re-programmed like a bad behavior... and something more bad, and this will be a most dangerous thing could happened if in wrong hands, or a mistake programming and training...` Like they will going to destroy everything not just humanity, first is defenses, and next is what are next? Systems? Computers? Files and labs, facilities, and most of it is Nuclear`
