bot-central 2020-09-24 23:35:06 -mapsuggest the upside down
bot-central 2020-09-24 23:35:52 like
bot-central 2020-09-24 23:36:11 inverted map under map
bot-central 2020-09-24 23:41:08 -mapsuggest elaborating on what a said before, under the map, you have an upside down replica of the map and it's monochrome with a few vines or something hanging from it. (the thing i said before was the upiside down)
bot-central 2020-09-24 23:41:13 there happy now
bot-central 2020-09-24 23:41:32 ok
bot-central 2020-09-25 00:03:31 why spam suggestion
bot-central 2020-09-25 00:04:59 -mapsuggest Make it so the map isnt a square
bot-central 2020-09-25 00:07:07 -mapsuggest Make it so the map is like an island and has water all around it
bot-central 2020-09-25 00:10:07 -mapsuggest make a new gamemode using a story (Like maybe you got stranded on an island and you have to get parts you find around the map and get better things to explore and escape using a rocket to get back to an space station that you got dispatched from to explore the new planet)
bot-central 2020-09-25 00:19:03 -mapsuggest make it so there are caves you can explore and maybe there is another base inside of it (and maybe some new blocks that can help you go over bumpy roads)
bot-central 2020-09-25 00:35:53 -mapsuggest an swamp where there is water but if you go in you get slowed down unless your a boat, but you have to dodge some tree roots (and maybe add some animals that don't move)
bot-central 2020-09-25 00:40:04 -mapsuggest make an underground road that you can travel with to water, airport, base, canyons, and the middle of the map. (and maybe an elevator)
