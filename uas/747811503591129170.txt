creations-chat 2021-11-01 20:01:23 <@!735970285852950559> ,i think vulpen's fear is-when somebody copies his f-14  also u should use shareX to take better screenshoots , and hide usernames

creations-chat 2022-01-15 06:05:37 maybe its not , but still i consider it as camouflage , i used this.Its changed a bit (mine)
creations-chat 2022-01-15 06:09:51 the changed thing is this .My wing no fully colored cause if i do this , it will start to glitch pain

bug-reports 2022-01-17 05:33:30 Something wrong with the save
bug-reports 2022-01-17 05:36:13 i tried it
bug-reports 2022-01-17 05:36:16 didnt help
bug-reports 2022-01-17 05:38:53 :/
bug-reports 2022-01-17 05:39:17 then im just gonna keep recoloring it , as its important for wing design
bug-reports 2022-01-17 06:24:17 it happens due to little fps
bug-reports 2022-01-17 06:27:45 its hard to see the wobble , but i tried to show it by making my fps cap 30
bug-reports 2022-01-17 06:28:15 the solution is using less graphics or use fps unlocker
bug-reports 2022-01-17 06:30:38 or its just another bug idk
bug-reports 2022-01-17 07:08:32 the answer no . Fps Unlocker unlocks fps and if your pc is powerfull it will increase
bug-reports 2022-01-17 07:08:49 but its not a save for weak devices
bug-reports 2022-01-17 09:24:23 how is it bug
bug-reports 2022-01-17 09:24:52 it happens only if the BLUE PART has another color , if they are the same colour it wont happen
bug-reports 2022-01-17 09:42:10 the same color = no bug 
different colors = bug
for dumb
bug-reports 2022-01-17 10:33:56 
bug-reports 2022-01-17 10:34:05 if these parts have different colors
bug-reports 2022-01-17 10:34:10 the bug happens
bug-reports 2022-01-17 10:34:29 if the color is the same
bug-reports 2022-01-17 10:34:42 then nothing happens
bug-reports 2022-01-17 10:35:13 k
bug-reports 2022-01-17 10:35:28 it saves the color now
bug-reports 2022-01-17 10:36:15 there is no , but i would say that its 50 / 50 solution
bug-reports 2022-01-17 10:39:56 
bug-reports 2022-01-17 10:40:53 no
bug-reports 2022-01-17 10:40:56 it wont save
bug-reports 2022-01-17 10:41:08 if one part is using another color

creations-chat 2022-10-06 02:24:51 Bug , if you place it horizontal way it does the funny
creations-chat 2022-10-06 02:26:54 Later , i need to fix wing swap , make lerx , add weapons , try to add windoscreen and a lot of stuff

creations-chat 2022-10-06 02:39:49 Head ? Front?
creations-chat 2022-10-06 02:41:52 Alr , but the main thing i want to fix is lerx
creations-chat 2022-10-26 14:11:09 Mig-27 wings are impossible to make accurate in Plane Crazy . Maybe the angle
creations-chat 2022-10-26 14:19:19 Firsly Mig-23BN . Secondly the wing must have the same angle as the lerx , even making the wing like this ain't helping . Or i could make the plane shorter which will break the entire plane
