help 2019-09-28 00:35:00 what happens if we go over our max save data? does that mean things that go over wont have certain things in it? also why does something that only has like 1000 blocks take up SO much data
help 2019-09-28 00:55:13 is your gif in reverse of something because it went down like 50k
help 2019-09-28 00:56:05 plus with all the stuff ive made combined its about 5000 blocks in total and takes up 240k data
help 2019-09-28 13:45:32 i dont know if this is normal, but i have 7576 blocks combined in all of my builds, yet somehow im over the amount of saved data i can use? i dont know why but im at like 261k when i barely have anything
