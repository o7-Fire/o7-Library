the-dump 2019-09-02 13:02:23 Not funny I didn't laugh. Your joke is so bad I would have preferred the joke went over my head and you gave up re-telling me the joke. To be honest this is a horrid attempt at trying to get a laugh out of me. Not a chuckle, not a hehe, not even a subtle burst of air out of my esophagus. Science says before you laugh your brain preps your face muscles but I didn't even feel the slightest twitch. 0/10 this joke is so bad I cannot believe anyone legally allowed you to be creative at all. The amount of brain power you must have put into that joke has the potential to power every house on Earth. Get a personality and learn how to make jokes, read a book. I'm not saying this to be funny I genuinely mean it on how this is just bottom barrel embarrassment at comedy. You've single handedly killed humor and every comedic act on the planet. I'm so disappointed that society has failed as a whole in being able to teach you how to be funny. Honestly if I put in all my power and time to try and make your joke funny it would require Einstein himself to build a device to strap me into so I can be connected to the energy of a billion stars to do it, and even then all that joke would get from people is a subtle scuff. You're lucky I still have the slightest of empathy for you after telling that joke otherwise I would have committed every war crime in the book just to prevent you from attempting any humor ever again. We should put that joke in text books so future generations can be wary.

creations-chat 2019-09-08 13:07:47 It uses a 2x2 motor adapter which i will post in a moment
creations-chat 2019-09-08 13:14:59 A 2x2 motor adapter, which works for any even amount of blocks (it just has to be centralized). It could be quite useful for any build using spinning parts, which are an even amount of blocks wide. The green blocks are 1x1x0.9's, The red blocks are pistons, The blue block is a motor, The yellow blocks are the spinning part. White blocks are used as connection. Known issues:
- It's kinda big
- The whole mechanism needs balancing, because bigger builds generate enough centrifugal force to make the pistons move around.

the-dump 2019-09-21 22:05:15 Not funny I didn't laugh. Your joke is so bad I would have preferred the joke went over my head and you gave up re-telling me the joke. To be honest this is a horrid attempt at trying to get a laugh out of me. Not a chuckle, not a hehe, not even a subtle burst of air out of my esophagus. Science says before you laugh your brain preps your face muscles but I didn't even feel the slightest twitch. 0/10 this joke is so bad I cannot believe anyone legally allowed you to be creative at all. The amount of brain power you must have put into that joke has the potential to power every house on Earth. Get a personality and learn how to make jokes, read a book. I'm not saying this to be funny I genuinely mean it on how this is just bottom barrel embarrassment at comedy. You've single handedly killed humor and every comedic act on the planet. I'm so disappointed that society has failed as a whole in being able to teach you how to be funny. Honestly if I put in all my power and time to try and make your joke funny it would require Einstein himself to build a device to strap me into so I can be connected to the energy of a billion stars to do it, and even then all that joke would get from people is a subtle scuff. You're lucky I still have the slightest of empathy for you after telling that joke otherwise I would have committed every war crime in the book just to prevent you from attempting any humor ever again. We should put that joke in text books so future generations can be wary.

help 2019-11-04 22:07:00 try to use something different and then try again
help 2019-11-04 22:07:53 you could try making some kind of a elevation and rotation mechanism that protects from wobbling but itll be hard
help 2019-11-04 22:08:03 could also jsut use an anchor block
help 2019-11-04 22:08:54 (or just downscale the whole gun)
help 2019-11-04 22:10:15 alright, then projectiles clipping into the barrel is a regular physics bug, anchors might have caused this but not sure. Anyway, try different solutions and which one of them works the best for you
help 2019-11-04 22:11:28 could also increase the area of where the projectile accelerates / decrease the acceleration / or both
help 2019-11-04 22:12:59 research makes progress

bug-reports 2019-11-18 23:23:51 nvm about the suspension bug, it seems it's fix was also included in the recent update, although instead of not freezing, after reaching the ~0.3 stud distance, it teleports into the correct place

help 2019-11-21 06:30:32 <@!307647486888247297> super rocket engines may be the cause for the freezing, try to replace with a regular rocket engine or a jet engine and it should work
bug-reports 2019-11-21 06:34:00 So, uhh, I've found that super rocket engines really often cause small motor2 creations to freeze. It can usually get fixed by swapping it for a regular rocket engine or a jet engine.
bug-reports 2019-11-21 06:34:27 Not sure if that always works but it did work for me a few times.
help 2019-11-21 06:34:48 <@421975189362966538> swapping engines does fix that, tested
help 2019-11-21 06:35:01 my torpedo didnt work until i used jet engines
help 2019-11-21 06:37:06 alright, then if wasnt the engines in your case
bug-reports 2019-11-21 06:41:07 Yeah, I'm just trying to say that it isn't always caused by the engines, but when it is, I gave a solution that might work

help 2019-11-21 13:12:36 <@458963775559565312> from what i know, the higher the damping, the faster the suspension returns to a position where it should be
help 2019-11-21 16:24:35 I mean, you could just build the whole barebone mechanism so that it's fully functional and only then slap the armour on some 100,100,1 suspension

help 2019-11-21 20:24:14 pistons slow the game down 100 times more than motors do
help 2019-11-21 20:25:46 motor pistons > piston blocks
help 2019-11-21 20:25:50 remember
help 2019-11-21 20:27:59 they use motors and suspension to act is a similar way to how a piston does, but provide a way higher extending distance and don't lag your things nearly as much
help 2019-11-21 20:28:22 the downsides are the size, complexity and instability
bug-reports 2019-11-21 20:36:24 rick help, this mechanism never worked even after the recent freezing fix update. The green motor2 always freezes until i touch it with my avatar
help 2019-11-21 20:37:33 Basically, this thing; the red motor is unpowered, the grrn one is a servo motor2. The yellow suspensions are both 0, 0, 1 and the grey blcoks are anchors.
help 2019-11-21 20:37:57 ~~jsut ignore the fact that it doesnt work at all coz motor2 broken~~

bug-reports 2019-11-21 22:53:25 ima try without them, but replacing still didnt do anything
bug-reports 2019-11-21 22:54:17 yeah, it was the anchor blocks again.
bug-reports 2019-11-21 22:54:45 The anchor blocks might need a fix to that since they are super useful for emchanism simulations, static builds and many other things
help 2019-11-21 22:55:31 vtoling that would be a nightmare
the-dump 2019-11-21 23:02:27 Good boy!
bug-reports 2019-11-21 23:27:51 Also, big boy bug:
Motor2's while wobbling, something causes their orientation to change randomly, which also causes the bound keys to get reversed
bug-reports 2019-11-21 23:29:25 Like, im rotating a big thing with a motor2. There is a second motor2,w hich allows it to rotate on a second axis. However, each time I spawn the whole thing in, the key that is supposed to rotate it clockwise, is reversed, same thing for the other key
bug-reports 2019-11-21 23:30:03 yeah, ima rephrase it
bug-reports 2019-11-21 23:30:44 <@!217336009455566848> sorry for the second ping, but since you're still online, I wanted to ask if you already know of this bug?
bug-reports 2019-11-21 23:31:31 hes online
bug-reports 2019-11-21 23:31:34 people do that
bug-reports 2019-11-21 23:32:21 dont really want to wait a couple days for him to see that
bug-reports 2019-11-21 23:32:26 since hes online rn
bug-reports 2019-11-21 23:32:50 welp, i cant use my emchanism coz of that exact bug
bug-reports 2019-11-21 23:32:56 it breaks the whole thing
bug-reports 2019-11-21 23:33:27 I still would like to at least know if rickje has already been told of that bug
bug-reports 2019-11-21 23:34:01 ok, can you already stop writing an essay on why I shouldnt report a bug to this channel thanks
bug-reports 2019-11-21 23:34:16 thats the freezing bug
