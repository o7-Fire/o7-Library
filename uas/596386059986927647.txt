creations-chat 2020-11-29 16:20:13 Any feedback on how i can improve my stealth bomber?
creations-chat 2020-11-29 16:21:43 alright
creations-chat 2020-11-29 16:24:39 eh the gaps occured because the bomber was going to ascend but i'll try my best to fix the issue to make it less visible

creations-chat 2020-11-29 19:03:24 for me i click the "esc" key on my keyboard click "record" with that recorder symbol and click take screenshot
creations-chat 2020-11-29 19:06:27 maybe add more propeller rotors and paint a camo, make sure its not vibrant the exception is markings but make sure theyre not that bright
creations-chat 2020-11-29 21:41:20 what camo terrain do you want?
creations-chat 2020-12-01 20:22:20 eh we care more about the results not the effort and time

creations-chat 2021-01-22 20:00:19 looks good altough i would personally make the white a bit darker other then that it looks pretty solid imo

creations-chat 2021-01-27 14:37:54 wow your builds are awesome!
creations-chat 2021-01-27 17:49:27 my friend typed that on my school computer
creations-chat 2021-02-03 22:23:49 <@!551099832584896539> the superstructure shape looks plain and boring, try to add move shapes to the superstructure and optionally the deck too. https://discordapp.com/channels/384021699466756103/384025409945337856/806541432478367755

creations-chat 2021-02-04 18:38:58 the track could have more detail to it, and the hull and track has a small gap between. make the turret larger. remove that small half wedge on the front hull.

The grey dome thingy? stick out like a sore thumb, try to flatten them. The wheels are small, try to make custom wheels instead of using cylinders. the ball on the gear shift is large (scale wise) so try and make it smaller.

creations-chat 2021-11-29 19:03:28 <@633731194093174795> besides your build just falls short in terms of the standards this community generally expects, just look at the hall of fame no offense

creations-chat 2021-12-05 17:58:15 i suggest you look at photos of modern/older warships to get familiar with their design philosophy, your ship's design needs work
creations-chat 2021-12-06 00:11:23 <@!792540918867165224> your german ww1 cruiser needs to be reworked in terms of design, too many turrets and their look, superstructure and the hull. i suggest searching for german ww1 cruisers for reference and build from that.
creations-chat 2021-12-06 00:15:50 mkay good day to you then
creations-chat 2021-12-06 00:23:44 That's gonna be the most detailed part of the build.
