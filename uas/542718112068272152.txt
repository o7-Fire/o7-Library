bug-reports 2020-02-07 16:18:27 I made a plane that has it’s wings attached with a quad-walker system and rotators so the wings can swivel down and it can start walking, but as soon as I spawn, the wings start glitching out like crazy and going through each other, often having it glitch away into the sky. Any idea why this is happening? I only have motors and pistons.
bug-reports 2020-02-07 16:18:36 It’s really annoying
bug-reports 2020-02-08 00:28:56 Also, I bet most of you have noticed that the parachutes (at least the player ones) are seriously bugged, flinging the player to their deaths after a few seconds. Turning off ragdoll only delays this for a good ten seconds. I would love to see this fixed.
