creations-chat 2021-02-18 15:24:25 It's easier to have some guns inside, but at the front. Kinda like a torp

Regarding the 'Lady Liberty'. I have upvoted and down voted. The only problem is the colour is to bright, if you want to find a realistic colour I recommend downloading the chrome extension 'colour picker'
creations-chat 2021-02-18 18:56:04 You shouldn't be dependant on others.
creations-chat 2021-02-18 18:59:00 I recommend watching FireyOblivion's 'Heli Tips' video. He has I think 2 videos or 3.
creations-chat 2021-02-19 09:32:20 only wait til he isn't on the server lol
I did the simple trick of putting in @ then his name but nope. He isn't here so if he does, he would get banned probs.
creations-chat 2021-02-19 09:36:45 He also botted his account.
creations-chat 2021-02-19 09:38:46 That's the saddest thing you can do. Flex that you have a good PC, have the shittiest channel and bot your account.
creations-chat 2021-02-19 09:43:27 If reports were back that would be good.
They should have "Game Moderation Team"
creations-chat 2021-02-19 09:45:31 Basically, you could do the reports on discord OR go in-game with a special tag. Just so they know you are a mod

Junny is actually a word, but its obvious he meant funny.
