creations-chat 2020-11-30 13:23:28 build a functional one and then design a more complicated one
also try 4 legged first than 2 legged.
creations-chat 2020-11-30 13:26:49 what
creations-chat 2020-11-30 13:29:35 ima assume that you want to build a battle mech or something, ill recommend just focusing on the mechanics of a mech (like the legs and balancing), then you make is smaller than more efficient, and then you stick a bunch of weapon systems on it.
creations-chat 2020-11-30 13:32:18 build big and messy thing first, then simplify it
creations-chat 2020-11-30 13:53:43 it will be on 2 legged walkers with smol feet

creations-chat 2021-04-16 10:24:58 hey can someone give me some suggestions of the mk5 tracks?
bug-reports 2021-11-03 14:32:29 you do realise that its hard to get a pc nowadays right
creations-chat 2022-02-09 14:31:58 wow this turned into a arguement
creations-chat 2022-04-24 14:56:58 fear
creations-chat 2022-06-22 15:23:23 this works
creations-chat 2022-06-22 15:40:40 sure, it works like a actual electric motor, using the magnets ability to push each other away
creations-chat 2022-06-22 15:43:52 the down sides are that its low torque and very, very laggy. the laggy part is really down to how magnets are just plain un-optimised in this game
