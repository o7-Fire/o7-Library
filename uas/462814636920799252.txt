plane-crazy 2020-03-06 21:30:27 the propellor its he prototype
plane-crazy 2020-03-06 21:29:45 hey brickzay can you make something with my prototype? https://streamable.com/p9z0u
plane-crazy 2020-03-06 21:28:14 we need plane crazy to be compatible with my fake apple watch
plane-crazy 2020-03-06 21:26:41 once, i was playing pinewood computer core with my friends, and i couldn't play much on my computer because it is a heavy game and i have an old i3 with integrated graphics, however i found that my phone ran well, but it broke about 3 days later, that was about 2 months ago, what does that mean? nothing you just wasted time reading my sad story.

oh and i have nothing against plane crazy on cell phones i think it's a good initiative
plane-crazy 2020-03-06 21:20:42 obviously
plane-crazy 2020-03-06 21:20:32 its sans man
plane-crazy 2020-03-06 21:18:37 hey guys still has a position for those who make a construction with their own creation mechanism?
plane-crazy 2020-03-06 21:16:06 oh and <@!413465414203342850> thx
plane-crazy 2020-03-06 21:15:47 please
plane-crazy 2020-03-06 21:15:45 can you make a video?
plane-crazy 2020-03-06 21:15:08 how much speed?
plane-crazy 2020-03-06 21:15:04 lol
plane-crazy 2020-03-06 21:14:47 <@!299289130964090881> did i asked?
plane-crazy 2020-03-06 21:13:49 https://streamable.com/p9z0u
plane-crazy 2020-03-06 21:13:44 is a propeller made of hover
plane-crazy 2020-03-06 21:12:38 can i post a video of a propulsion test on plane crazy (i uploaded it on stremable)?
plane-crazy 2020-03-06 21:10:39 yea

plane-crazy 2019-05-27 02:49:33 I sent it here because that guy gave an idea, so I just wanted to show you how it would go
plane-crazy 2019-05-27 02:48:27 <@315771093010874369>  difference between the two fronts (I'm considering the front that I use currently starts after the black line, so being 10 blocks tall)
plane-crazy 2019-05-27 02:26:14 kekenshi where should I have put these blocks?
plane-crazy 2019-05-27 02:25:21 yea
plane-crazy 2019-05-27 02:25:17 like i can use 10 but lag soo
plane-crazy 2019-05-27 02:25:06 1
plane-crazy 2019-05-27 02:23:59 ;-;
plane-crazy 2019-05-27 02:23:53 Is it cool there?
plane-crazy 2019-05-27 02:23:33 behold you begin to make the ship, come up to half the carcass, and stop
plane-crazy 2019-05-17 02:13:06 ok i will try to do zumwalt with 4 parts and....... with a cruise missile
plane-crazy 2019-05-17 01:47:45 Do I make zumwalt divided into 2 or 4? in 4 it is more laborious but it stays longer
plane-crazy 2019-05-17 01:15:10 
plane-crazy 2019-05-17 01:13:45 For now I'm going to give just a taste of what's to come.
plane-crazy 2019-05-17 01:12:01 thanks rick, it's been so long since I've been waiting for these blocks my god I'm going to make some really cool constructions now
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 22:07:58 nice
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 22:06:16 guys the friction block does what?
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 22:00:38 guys the friction block does what?
