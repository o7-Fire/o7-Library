creations-chat 2022-05-23 20:00:15 i genuinely think that u should use a more blocky canopy for the eurofighter unless youre gonna do a smokepipe canopy
cylinder canopies arent that good tbh, ik its ironic that im saying this

help 2022-05-24 01:29:16 the root of the problem is that the wing and leading edge extension arent swept back enough
help 2022-05-24 01:30:11 other wise you'd be able to put the elevators farther back and still line up properly with the wing's trailing edge
help 2022-05-24 01:32:32 f14 max sweep in flight is 68 degrees, compared to your ~63.4 degrees (assuming that you used the 1x2 delta wing for the LERX)

creations-chat 2022-05-28 02:33:27 no actually the j-10 is more original than the jf17
allegedly they stole f16 blueprints for developing the jf17 and im inclined to believe it's true
creations-chat 2022-05-28 02:40:43 the aerodynamic configuration of the j-10 is still very different from the eurofighter (<@389516889501728779> and also the lavi id argue) considering the different distance between the canards and wings
it's hard to actually "copy" an entire airframe and still make many noticeable differences, and also because those differences require changes in electronics and flight control systems, and the j-10b and c have very advanced electronics compared to early f16 and the lavi (the lavi was from the 70s or 80s so it definitely had obsolete electronics)
the true copies as for china would be the j-11 (and other flankers) and the migs (j-7, j-6, j-5, and j-4 bla blah bla)
creations-chat 2022-05-28 02:43:02 no one does, i think china gets a lot of shit because their military power has only risen recently, and we're just not used to its presence in the world stage
creations-chat 2022-05-28 02:48:32 f22, f18, su27, f15 they all have the conventional wing configuration with large main wings, and horizontal and vertical stabilizers in the rear, it's all the same configuration none of it is new in aerodynamics, only small improvements nothing revolutionary
eurofighter and rafale are both delta wings with canards

creations-chat 2022-05-28 02:52:16 <@389516889501728779> all modern fighters base much of their aerodynamic designs on previously existing aircraft, it's undisputed
but i did realize that "originality" is subjective so im not gonna continue to debate -

"all fighters are copies of each other because they all share some similarities" is stupid, and it's also wrong to say that any plane (even the wright brothers') were entirely original,
nothing about this is objective
creations-chat 2022-05-28 02:56:16 i never said theyre all the same, i said they have similar aerodynamic configurations
creations-chat 2022-05-28 03:00:09 never denied that each have their own innovations, but it's certain that they share more similarities than differences
creations-chat 2022-05-28 03:02:10 <@389516889501728779> before u finish typing
let's just stop, this is all subjective there's no end to this logically
dang it didnt get the timing
creations-chat 2022-05-28 03:05:32 "ur opinion is incorrect"
is this an oxymoron

creations-chat 2022-05-31 15:32:18 how tf does this have so many upvotes its actually terrible
WHY IS COOLDOWN 10 MINUTES
creations-chat 2022-05-31 17:10:24 nah dude wtf is that canopy also the the intake with nacelles design is so incredibly unrealistic, it's literally parallel to the fuselage starting from intakes to exhaust, tiny vertical stabilzer (would probably flat spin more than the f14a if this was real) and the front is so bulky, more so than the f4
creations-chat 2022-05-31 17:12:51 yeah but those dont have 250+ upvotes
creations-chat 2022-05-31 17:15:40 not by a huge margin, imo its nowhere close to boxne's level
a bit better than the mirage milan (i think it deserves around 100 to 150 upvotes)
<@866848584888877077> that's not the expectation, but at least make realistic design choices such as a narrowing nacelle like on the f106 and more realistic proportions regarding wing area and the rest of the plane
creations-chat 2022-05-31 17:18:11 i meant yours should be 100-150
im talking about your build combared to boxne's (i was referring to boxne's ah-1)

help 2022-07-13 17:51:42 yeah
help 2022-07-13 17:52:23 also if you used disconnectors instead of tnt you wouldnt need so much cameras
help 2022-07-13 17:52:45 and cameras are expensive in terms of performance

creations-chat 2022-07-14 21:38:20 <@294980570885390346> how do you always manage to make your canopy so shit lmao
creations-chat 2022-07-14 21:41:12 the shape is so goofy
creations-chat 2022-07-14 21:43:33 accurate? it doesnt even have the canopy frame

<@294980570885390346> if youre talking about my mirage, just know that i made the canopy over a year ago
creations-chat 2022-07-14 21:48:38 <@294980570885390346>
creations-chat 2022-07-14 21:55:58 these two look nothing alike
creations-chat 2022-07-14 21:57:58 the size and positioning of the canard too üóø

<@706717603258957864> so what? a roblox build can resemble a real world thing
creations-chat 2022-07-14 22:00:06 <@294980570885390346> the perspective

<@706717603258957864> do you know what resemblance means üóø
creations-chat 2022-07-14 22:02:37 <@294980570885390346> it looks short because of the perspective
it appears even shorter in this image for obvious reasons
creations-chat 2022-07-14 22:05:25 <@294980570885390346>

oh wait r u talking about the bleed channel
creations-chat 2022-07-14 22:07:28 cylinder canopy doesnt solve the problem
creations-chat 2022-07-14 22:10:08 my mirage is like an entire block or two too short, valid
but the shape isnt far off at all whereas your builds üíÄ
creations-chat 2022-07-14 22:13:38 at least its not just a flat edge like yours
help 2022-07-22 17:20:57 yeah definitely
creations-chat 2022-07-22 17:26:45 the audacity
contest-chat 2022-12-06 23:46:11 <@441125486312030221> this is not a rotorcraft lmao
contest-chat 2022-12-06 23:48:25 the blades do not complete a full 2pi rad horizontal rotation to generate lift
contest-chat 2022-12-07 00:08:06 but there arent any rotors in that thing, rotors only rotate on one axis!!!! üò§
creations-chat 2022-12-07 05:15:10 try unpowering the motor, make sure no rotating section is colliding with the fuselage, and I‚Äôd recommend using hover engines
creations-chat 2022-12-07 17:32:00 <:trollface:775024642104229898> I am the perpetrator
creations-chat 2022-12-07 18:57:38 not enough torque on the motor, t=rFsin(theta), the longer the radius, in this case the engine, the the more torque is required. it‚Äôs unfixable because game bad
creations-chat 2022-12-07 19:02:47 or just reduce mass
creations-chat 2022-12-08 23:08:21 me when nonorthographic perspective
creations-chat 2022-12-08 23:29:54 it means you‚Äôre comparing a 2d image with a 3d perspective
creations-chat 2022-12-09 01:22:13 no <@773474989751664640> it is inaccurate
creations-chat 2022-12-09 01:25:39 this mf üíÄ
creations-chat 2022-12-09 01:29:47 <@781989929076523009> u asked why blueprint overlays are inaccurate (u did not believe it), and gam explained that, hes not crying about it
creations-chat 2022-12-09 01:32:17 more rigorous proof: depth perception
the-dump 2022-12-09 20:58:01 also the fattest I‚Äôve seen
