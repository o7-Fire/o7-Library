The Tale of pilotred233 (279997458375901188)
bug-reports 2019-07-06 03:27:06 when you anchor an object and send a part of the vehicle (like a torpedo) with a detacher. if theres an engine on that part, it will fail to function in a short time.
creations-chat 2019-10-03 07:38:19 so why do people submit creations?
creations-chat 2019-10-03 07:42:33 idk
creations-chat 2019-10-03 07:43:16 planecrazy got boring once I actually built some really well functioning creations
creations-chat 2019-10-03 07:43:35 maybe I could...find a way to get some challenge?
creations-chat 2019-10-03 07:44:16 same
creations-chat 2019-10-03 07:44:29 actually I'm the opposite
creations-chat 2019-10-03 07:44:52 I just have some random inspiration and then I'd create that build till i get bored
creations-chat 2019-10-03 07:45:22 Sandbox building games to me is like...an artist drawing on his canvas
creations-chat 2019-10-03 07:46:00 well it's hard for me cuz I love breakthroughs
creations-chat 2019-10-03 07:46:09 oh wait
creations-chat 2019-10-03 07:46:18 motor2 glitching? how so?
creations-chat 2019-10-03 07:46:58 add some torque
creations-chat 2019-10-03 07:47:05 make sure it's just enough
creations-chat 2019-10-03 07:48:40 also maybe i can see how it's glitching?
creations-chat 2019-10-08 06:45:28 so how do u get different ranks?
creations-chat 2019-10-08 06:45:37 also what so ranks do?
help 2019-10-11 03:37:20 the physics in this game...
help 2019-10-11 03:37:31 my god ;-;
creations-chat 2019-10-14 01:19:42 someone made the house in UP!
creations-chat 2019-10-14 01:19:45 idk why
help 2019-10-16 04:33:24 I think it’s just how the force is exerted on which part of ur vehicle
help 2019-10-16 04:34:29 And the part of ur vehicle that doesn’t want to move but ur exerting force on it
creations-chat 2019-10-17 07:39:17 lmao it looks trollish
creations-chat 2019-10-17 07:39:41 would be so funny if someone tries to evade this as a ship
creations-chat 2019-10-17 07:45:43 big rip XD
creations-chat 2019-10-18 01:58:00 that looks like an engine taken out from a car
creations-chat 2019-10-18 01:58:03 what can it do?
creations-chat 2019-10-18 02:08:12 hmm...
creations-chat 2019-10-18 02:08:27 so it's just an engine?
creations-chat 2019-10-18 02:09:09 whats does that even mean...isn't that an engine?
creations-chat 2019-10-18 02:09:33 I don't get the difference between an engenine and an engine
creations-chat 2019-10-18 02:10:48 It's a part of the vehicle that transfer fuel into gas that runs pistons which generates power.
creations-chat 2019-10-18 02:11:11 and engines don't have much of a purpose in a game where rotators have their own power.
creations-chat 2019-10-18 02:11:30 no, i mean I have never ever made any "custom engines" because they seem useless
creations-chat 2019-10-18 02:11:58 well magnets got fixed recently I think.
creations-chat 2019-10-18 02:12:03 which sucked even more.
creations-chat 2019-10-18 02:13:05 then again an engine that looks like an engine and has pistons seems good looking but overall still not very useful.
creations-chat 2019-10-18 08:02:22 Wut's battlebots?
creations-chat 2019-10-18 08:03:41 Oof.
creations-chat 2019-10-21 01:41:59 maybe they're offended by it.
creations-chat 2019-10-21 01:44:43 :/
creations-chat 2019-10-21 01:44:50 yeah
creations-chat 2019-10-21 01:45:03 it could be deemed as serious
creations-chat 2019-10-21 01:49:55 It's just miscommunication I guess...
creations-chat 2019-10-21 01:50:12 but seriously though don't say things that offend people
creations-chat 2019-10-21 01:50:28 no, it's when you say anything.
creations-chat 2019-10-21 01:51:07 well is it even possible for someone to not be offended anymore?
bot-central 2019-10-21 01:51:42 remilia scarlet lol
bot-central 2019-10-21 01:52:36 ?help
bot-central 2019-10-21 01:52:50 dyno :/
creations-chat 2019-10-21 01:59:02 why do people even argue about stuff geez
creations-chat 2019-10-21 02:01:56 It's kinda hard to make something big NOT lag out
creations-chat 2019-10-21 02:02:17 yeah true.
creations-chat 2019-10-21 02:02:54 it's so annoying when people make planes that are everything
creations-chat 2019-10-21 02:03:09 im annoyed by "it can vtol and function like a heli,plane,rover,boat and even submarine"
creations-chat 2019-10-21 02:03:28 in actuality they're not really built for these things.
creations-chat 2019-10-21 02:05:04 exactly lol vtol heli XD
creations-chat 2019-10-21 02:05:14 floating boat is fine.
creations-chat 2019-10-21 02:14:25 how does the creations submissions work
creations-chat 2019-10-21 02:14:54 I think I care about functionality more than looks.
creations-chat 2019-10-21 02:15:03 kinda makes my creations look bad.
creations-chat 2019-10-21 02:15:37 quite fast for a winged craft
creations-chat 2019-10-21 02:19:43 ima go look at creations for battleship designs maybe.
the-dump 2019-10-21 02:21:11 send nukes
creations-chat 2019-10-21 02:22:04 my godness theres an actual interior for it
creations-chat 2019-10-21 02:22:26 tho I mean a uhhh....
creations-chat 2019-10-21 02:22:39 highly combat capable warship.
creations-chat 2019-10-21 02:22:49 the pvp type
creations-chat 2019-10-21 02:23:35 k good night then
creations-chat 2019-10-21 02:24:43 thats okay actually
creations-chat 2019-10-21 02:25:19 Lag makes you tougher?
creations-chat 2019-10-21 02:26:08 yeah something like that
creations-chat 2019-10-21 02:26:26 I've experienced it on one of my ships...uses about 2600blocks
creations-chat 2019-10-21 02:27:13 well then again the anti air is kinda hard to deal with for me.
creations-chat 2019-10-21 02:28:04 well have u actually fought people with planes fitted with tnt and they ram you?
creations-chat 2019-10-21 02:28:08 ugh so annoying
creations-chat 2019-10-21 02:28:39 oh...
creations-chat 2019-10-21 02:29:04 so don't go to pvp servers or public pvp servers
creations-chat 2019-10-21 02:30:03 well still...how do you deal with people who do this "planes fitted with tnt"
creations-chat 2019-10-21 02:31:08 well tbh I was thinking of a way to take them down before they take me
creations-chat 2019-10-21 02:31:33 like having a sort of ciws like weapon but on a larger scale.
creations-chat 2019-10-21 02:31:50 but it hasnt worked out...
creations-chat 2019-10-21 02:42:05 how
creations-chat 2019-10-21 02:45:20 how do u make a flying cutter.
creations-chat 2019-10-21 02:47:22 anyone know how to counter tnt fitted planes?
creations-chat 2019-10-21 02:51:56 "anyone know how to counter tnt fitted planes?"
help 2019-10-21 02:54:09 "anyone know how to counter tnt fitted planes?"
help 2019-10-21 03:00:47 .
help 2019-10-21 03:00:57 well how do you build a spinning cutter?
creations-chat 2019-10-21 11:45:36 My first post and first thrust based aircraft, has excellent performance in the air along with extra weapon advancements.
creations-chat 2019-10-21 11:55:04 Well good u kinda asked.
creations-chat 2019-10-21 11:55:19 I made this craft from thrust then wings.
creations-chat 2019-10-21 11:55:53 This makes the turning speed of the craft significantly much more maneuverable then when starting with wings.
creations-chat 2019-10-21 11:56:05 It does NOT perform like an aerodynamic aircraft
creations-chat 2019-10-21 11:56:17 And is capable of turning instantaneously
creations-chat 2019-10-21 11:56:39 While being stable
the-dump 2019-10-22 07:33:38 lawl
creations-chat 2019-10-22 07:36:20 :/ hai
creations-chat 2019-10-23 14:33:52 This is a new ship that's WIP so far, tell me how I can improve the looks of this while being able to pvp if you think it's not gud enough.
creations-chat 2019-10-23 14:35:01 oof lol
creations-chat 2019-10-23 14:35:23 so it's either pvp capability or looks?
creations-chat 2019-10-23 14:35:34 rip.
creations-chat 2019-10-23 14:36:00 I could remove the torpedoes and theres a dingy in the rear actually
creations-chat 2019-10-23 14:36:27 yeah ik
creations-chat 2019-10-23 14:36:34 it was originally just for rp purposes
creations-chat 2019-10-23 14:36:45 okay lol
creations-chat 2019-10-23 14:37:25 ima replace the dingy with mine laying devices
creations-chat 2019-10-23 14:40:17 a huge minefield yes
creations-chat 2019-10-23 14:40:29 that's the idea anyway
creations-chat 2019-10-24 02:29:11 Should I just make a vehicle that looks good instead of focus on pvp abilities?
creations-chat 2019-10-24 02:29:26 (At least I’ll try to make it look good)
creations-chat 2019-10-24 02:33:43 Probably lol
creations-chat 2019-10-24 02:56:58 A church
creations-chat 2019-10-24 02:57:30 Those chairs
creations-chat 2019-10-24 02:57:47 No cuz epic
creations-chat 2019-10-24 03:12:14 I like the t34 over there
creations-chat 2019-10-24 04:55:55 How is that a bad creation?
creations-chat 2019-10-24 04:56:14 It's literally the millennium falcon :/
help 2019-10-24 04:58:07 Maybe it's not totally balanced, plus make sure the center of mass is on top of the center of lift and the stabilizers maybe.
creations-chat 2019-10-24 04:59:36 :/
creations-chat 2019-10-24 04:59:48 Does it have to be the best build in order for it to be good?
creations-chat 2019-10-24 05:00:16 Jesus lol
creations-chat 2019-10-24 05:00:26 Okay
creations-chat 2019-10-24 05:00:42 What's the best then?
creations-chat 2019-10-24 05:01:15 (cool flying pancake I saw it yesterday)
creations-chat 2019-10-24 05:01:26 :/
creations-chat 2019-10-24 05:01:47 U sure it is possible to make a perfect build?
creations-chat 2019-10-24 05:02:30 There's no way anyone can make the exact same thing from a picture.
creations-chat 2019-10-24 05:02:43 Seems impossible to me
creations-chat 2019-10-24 05:03:35 So I don't see how anything is going to improve his design if he has to follow a picture on the internet that probably isn't perfect either
creations-chat 2019-10-24 05:03:55 :/
creations-chat 2019-10-24 05:04:17 Awesome
creations-chat 2019-10-24 05:04:23 What
creations-chat 2019-10-24 05:04:27 :/ okay
creations-chat 2019-10-24 05:04:33 Is everything bad
creations-chat 2019-10-24 05:04:41 When do you say it's good
creations-chat 2019-10-24 05:05:16 :/
creations-chat 2019-10-24 05:05:33 Well I'll give my opinion on ur car
creations-chat 2019-10-24 05:05:46 I think ur build looks awesome
creations-chat 2019-10-24 05:05:57 So sleek too
creations-chat 2019-10-24 06:52:35 but u got 6 likes
creations-chat 2019-10-24 06:52:40 nvm
creations-chat 2019-10-24 06:52:50 5 likes 6 dislikes
creations-chat 2019-10-24 06:52:53 :/
creations-chat 2019-10-24 07:03:48 don't look at dislikes maybe...
creations-chat 2019-10-24 07:04:06 people judge it by looks
creations-chat 2019-10-24 07:04:17 (or just by looking once)
creations-chat 2019-10-24 07:05:24 how fast though?
creations-chat 2019-10-24 07:05:48 :/
creations-chat 2019-10-24 07:05:52 and why is that
creations-chat 2019-10-24 07:06:29 well look at the size first.
creations-chat 2019-10-24 07:06:46 I don't think he can fit that
creations-chat 2019-10-24 07:07:05 well uhhh....
creations-chat 2019-10-24 07:07:43 if it was smaller then it would be harder to go into detail, if it was larger it could have alot of detail but as you've said "could be smaller"
creations-chat 2019-10-24 07:08:38 then it would be wide?
creations-chat 2019-10-24 07:08:48 okay then
creations-chat 2019-10-24 07:08:54 I guess he could try
creations-chat 2019-10-24 07:09:54 wut.
the-dump 2019-10-24 07:10:19 just for reference
creations-chat 2019-10-24 07:10:37 like the one in <#495286269459300364> ?
creations-chat 2019-10-24 07:11:01 I'm not sure if that's possible for the detail
creations-chat 2019-10-24 07:11:16 but okay if he has to do that then the creation has to be larger?
creations-chat 2019-10-24 07:11:28 (cuz that's too small)
creations-chat 2019-10-24 07:12:10 isn't it 7 blocks wide?
creations-chat 2019-10-24 07:12:39 nine i mean
creations-chat 2019-10-24 07:13:06 the front is hard to replicate though...
creations-chat 2019-10-24 07:13:34 oh my that's actually nice
creations-chat 2019-10-24 07:14:07 if theres a way to reduce friction while walking maybe.
creations-chat 2019-10-24 07:14:21 but it's so cool
creations-chat 2019-10-24 07:14:29 tons of rotors...
creations-chat 2019-10-24 07:14:48 how'd u figure out on how to make this walk the way it is?
creations-chat 2019-10-24 07:17:05 he could improve on that yes.
creations-chat 2019-10-24 07:17:51 well usually I take inspiration from other vehicles...or irl vehicles
creations-chat 2019-10-24 07:18:20 generally carriers do have control rooms on the side to obstruct the runway less.
creations-chat 2019-10-24 07:19:30 uhhh
creations-chat 2019-10-24 07:19:36 I mean the control room
creations-chat 2019-10-24 07:19:45 probably inside
the-dump 2019-10-24 07:20:17 no control room? idk
creations-chat 2019-10-24 07:20:27 just placing reference pics in <#495286269459300364>
creations-chat 2019-10-24 07:21:37 I'm guessing that the control tower is the control room, which is probably somewhere on the tower on the side of carriers
creations-chat 2019-10-24 07:47:27 oh my it looks just like a simple tnt cannons i once built in minecraft, which was probably also build by many people in minecraft XDDD
creations-chat 2019-10-24 07:48:14 I think he meant that you could make the foot larger in area.
creations-chat 2019-10-24 08:05:32 I can't make one rn I'm on mobile
creations-chat 2019-10-24 11:12:58 sorry i afk
creations-chat 2019-10-24 11:13:19 I mean reduce friction on the legs that are supposed to be off the ground
creations-chat 2019-10-24 11:13:43 but since they're balls, the legs that are not supposed to be off the ground touch the ground which creates friction.
creations-chat 2019-10-25 02:00:32 not judging this harshly then.
bot-central 2019-10-25 06:42:43 tenshi lol
bot-central 2019-10-25 06:43:06 btw I guess you like touhou 🙂
creations-chat 2019-10-25 06:51:40 I assume it can fire right?
creations-chat 2019-10-25 06:52:21 Still it looks really clean but I’m not good with guns.
creations-chat 2019-10-25 06:53:30 Lol
bug-reports 2019-10-25 07:02:34 More graphics failing to load :/
creations-chat 2019-10-25 07:32:46 um
creations-chat 2019-10-25 07:32:50 wait
creations-chat 2019-10-25 07:33:31 maybe vip means Ur scope is a bit small
creations-chat 2019-10-25 07:33:56 so wait... I want to know whether the width of the gun is an even number or an odd number?
creations-chat 2019-10-25 07:34:14 okay then whats the size of the scope?
creations-chat 2019-10-25 07:34:21 how many times how many times how many
creations-chat 2019-10-25 07:34:30 that's definetely not 2x2 blocks
creations-chat 2019-10-25 07:34:39 looks like 3x3
creations-chat 2019-10-25 07:35:07 well assume that the half blocks are full block size k?
creations-chat 2019-10-25 07:35:10 it can be confusing
creations-chat 2019-10-25 07:35:18 :/
creations-chat 2019-10-25 07:35:33 okay ill just say it my way
creations-chat 2019-10-25 07:35:50 anyway you can try 5x5 and see if it works better
creations-chat 2019-10-25 07:36:06 I know this might be alot of work but if you want to improve ill give you this advice 🙂
creations-chat 2019-10-25 07:38:48 it is now, but how about giving him some thought rather than bare criticism.
creations-chat 2019-10-25 07:39:13 the fact still remains, there are limitations so only do what you can.
creations-chat 2019-10-25 07:39:19 don't give advice that is impossible
creations-chat 2019-10-25 07:42:25 well then how do you think he can build the scope?
creations-chat 2019-10-25 07:42:32 I reccomended 5x5
creations-chat 2019-10-25 07:42:43 he is putting effort.
creations-chat 2019-10-25 07:42:51 :/
creations-chat 2019-10-25 07:43:02 looks better?
creations-chat 2019-10-25 07:43:34 😐

creations-chat 2019-10-25 08:00:59 Well uhhh...If you like you can use a 5x5 config but the scope's frame could use 2x1 wedges.
creations-chat 2019-10-25 08:02:05 Half wedges2 2x1 down
creations-chat 2019-10-25 08:02:10 I think anyway.

help 2020-01-14 02:11:52 Is ur plane slow?
help 2020-01-14 02:12:14 Is ur plane flying slow
help 2020-01-14 02:12:18 When u take off
help 2020-01-14 02:13:01 Then the source of the problem is insufficient lift
help 2020-01-14 02:13:22 Adding more wings or using a better engine would be the solution.
help 2020-01-14 02:14:06 It’s easy to tell the issue from the pics, the wings are obviously tiny and the plane looks heavy
help 2020-01-14 02:14:41 Wdym by that creativforce
help 2020-01-14 02:15:05 Yeah but he’s already done that, his plane isn’t flipping out of control

creations-chat 2020-01-22 00:18:49 What’s interesting is that there are more likes than dislikes when there are more wedges
creations-chat 2020-01-22 00:20:09 Guess it’s not worth posting creations for feedback
creations-chat 2020-01-22 01:30:21 The heck, someone got banned for being underaged.
creations-chat 2020-01-22 01:55:00 so you guys like fictional builds or realistic builds or somewhere in between?
creations-chat 2020-01-22 01:55:52 😅

creations-chat 2020-01-22 01:57:42 yea...and it seems that when someone builds then it gets disliked alot.
creations-chat 2020-01-22 01:58:22 okay
creations-chat 2020-01-22 01:58:27 ill observe a bit
creations-chat 2020-01-22 02:01:05 .
creations-chat 2020-01-22 02:01:15 looks like it's about how much time you spend on one creation
creations-chat 2020-01-22 02:01:39 it's the details on each creation that catch the eye.
creations-chat 2020-01-22 02:01:41 yes^
creations-chat 2020-01-22 02:01:46 seems that way.
creations-chat 2020-01-22 02:02:16 if I need to do that, it'll take alot of time and I only started building replicas cuz of penguininvasion37
creations-chat 2020-01-22 02:02:37 might as well do so when I have the motivation to.
creations-chat 2020-01-22 02:03:20 to get many upvotes, the trick is to treat every creation like an art piece?
creations-chat 2020-01-22 02:08:47 I'ma see if I can make it so details win over functionality if i were to share another post
creations-chat 2020-01-22 03:48:28 lmao
creations-chat 2020-01-22 05:55:37 I guess that’s how you see it. 😄
