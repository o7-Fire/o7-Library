plane-crazy 2020-01-17 01:56:26 saves up space for pitch based control surfaces.
plane-crazy 2020-01-17 01:56:01 sounds useful.
plane-crazy 2020-01-16 08:48:46 This happens a lot when I'm building too so it's commonplace for me and totally not annoying
plane-crazy 2020-01-16 08:48:11 When a newbie goes into ur slot and takes a look at ur creation, it means he/she is interested at what ur building.
plane-crazy 2020-01-16 08:31:47 yea
plane-crazy 2020-01-16 08:27:20 super strength is already controversial to me
plane-crazy 2020-01-16 08:26:51 idk
plane-crazy 2020-01-16 08:26:49 or you could view it as power to ratio?
plane-crazy 2020-01-16 08:26:08 First off, what even is "super strength"?
plane-crazy 2020-01-16 08:24:38 yes
plane-crazy 2020-01-16 08:24:33 if the tnt isn't armed, it can't explode on contact for example.
plane-crazy 2020-01-16 08:24:12 well okay, arm basically is a safety switch
plane-crazy 2020-01-16 08:23:53 ????
plane-crazy 2020-01-16 06:56:55 Idk why some builds have more votes than other builds.

plane-crazy 2020-01-16 06:45:59 How interesting
plane-crazy 2020-01-14 07:01:35 If theres more mass, then you'll need more force.
plane-crazy 2020-01-14 06:54:12 anything that can provide sufficient turning force to your craft.
plane-crazy 2020-01-10 02:01:23 cuz im a cantonese speaker lol

plane-crazy 2020-01-10 02:00:52 it's just a common name.
plane-crazy 2020-01-10 02:00:13 Êùé ok
plane-crazy 2020-01-06 01:29:48 sometimes you don't need mod powers to solve situations like this

plane-crazy 2020-01-06 01:21:51 oh great, a topic I actually want to talk about for too long
plane-crazy 2020-01-06 01:21:10 something in the lines of that, yes
plane-crazy 2020-01-06 01:20:45 a cold war would be....more probably but whatever it's just a theory
plane-crazy 2020-01-06 01:19:57 nukes are called weapons of peace for a reason ya know?
plane-crazy 2020-01-06 01:19:45 ww3 won't start because countries are currently pointing nukes at each other.
plane-crazy 2020-01-06 01:19:16 fine how about I just say something I wanted for a bit.

plane-crazy 2019-11-01 02:42:29 so if you were to say that then yes.
plane-crazy 2019-11-01 02:42:20 anyway in a sense tho, ufo saucers probably don't exist

plane-crazy 2019-10-24 07:52:04 good night
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 07:51:33 but i joined a while back
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 07:51:24 didn't take notice of this server till 3 days ago
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 07:50:52 oh i didnt know lol
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 07:50:37 does that even exist is the better question lol
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 07:49:34 I guess not everyone is that good at using terms.
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 07:49:17 lol
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 07:45:13 it's hard when people complain about bugs i guess.
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 07:44:20 maybe people don't notice this game or don't like the genre or something else.
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 07:43:55 how is this not on the main page already
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 07:43:22 plane crazy is pretty awesome for a sandbox game on roblox...
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 07:41:43 oh nice.
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 07:36:46 :/
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 05:42:33 Nobody is even aware of it
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 05:42:12 Well I guess I already conveyed my point
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 05:41:15 Look...It's not as simple
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 05:40:38 You can't tell when people leave
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 05:40:31 It happens without you seeing it
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 05:40:13 And this ends when people lose all their will to build again
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 05:39:58 Here's how I see it:
-People post their creations here to share.
-you guys say something negative, vague and judgemental.
-people get discouraged
-people try again
ITS A VICIOUS CYCLE
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 05:38:23 Is it even possible for anyone else anymore?
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 05:38:01 Unless you like to watch the world burn, don't make the world burn.
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 05:37:17 I'm mad because you guys are judging them
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 05:37:06 And you guys are the ones behind it
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 05:36:57 It's discouraging to people
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 05:36:49 It's not helpful
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 05:36:43 People just say "bad"
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 05:36:37 No negative comments aren't about advice here.
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 05:36:22 It is a pattern.
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 05:36:18 Yes
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 05:36:13 This is becoming an obvious pattern guys
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 05:36:03 So if you don't get negative comments on your builds, you become better?
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 05:35:10 It doesn't seem fair
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 05:34:52 It's all about the irrational thought on a creation.
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 05:34:09 No it's so straight forward, people don't seem to care about how much effort you place
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 05:33:34 It infuriates me to think about it.
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 05:33:20 And in this case, memes
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 05:33:11 Yes, effort doesn't matter because people judge it by something direct. Like looks.
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 05:32:22 Inconsistent :(
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 05:32:06 Well first people say "looks mean everything" and then this comes up
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 05:31:24 Like what's wrong with people :/
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 05:31:12 Exactly
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 05:30:48 People seriously judge you by looks...But does it matter if you can build something like this and get away with it? Don't say nobody has built this yet I'm sure tons of people have the same dumb idea
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 05:29:51 Another similar thing was a block getting tons of upvotes
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 05:29:33 I saw this actually
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 05:29:29 That's what bothered me
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 05:29:25 See
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 05:28:18 <#384025409945337856> still bothers me
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 05:27:55 Okay :/
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 05:27:42 Okay
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 05:27:28 This server is about judging people's builds
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 05:27:17 It's been bothering me that well
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 05:27:08 Legendofthesolomon...
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 05:26:22 I can still see it?
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 05:23:25 Any early builds you still have rn that r positive?
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 05:22:23 I wanna see it tbh
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 05:21:39 Wut was it?
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 05:21:03 You realise people judge builds by looking at them right?
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 05:19:51 To get positive builds
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 05:19:37 So it took you no time
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 05:18:47 To get some positive builda
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 05:18:27 How long did it take you
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 05:17:06 It hurts to know that at least okay?
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 05:16:36 It's very uncomfortable to watch
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 05:16:27 People still get judged here
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 05:16:19 Well that's beside the fact
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 05:15:43 That still makes them people üòï
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 05:14:55 I feel bad for people who post stuff here and get unmotivated by down votes
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 05:14:22 It sure feels like it
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 05:14:02 And it doesn't help because the criticism is just being down voted
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 05:13:34 I feel like people post their stuff here just to be criticized about
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 05:13:07 Really
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 05:12:40 Sorta disappointed by "high standards" :/
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 05:11:46 Well do you guys judge vehicles by looking at them purely?
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 05:10:48 :/
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 05:06:52 No matter how much effort you put, it doesn't matter
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 05:06:42 I have learned a valuable lesson
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 05:06:38 
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 04:59:25 Why down vote this though? How can he improve his design?
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 04:59:11

plane-crazy 2019-10-24 02:42:47 Ship whoever Danny deciduus is.
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 02:42:28 Lol
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 02:41:10 :/ okay
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 02:40:31 Rip
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 02:40:27 Kinda sucks
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 02:40:22 I guess I do functionality over looks
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 02:39:56 A factory
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 02:39:33 Because I haven‚Äôt tried lol
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 02:39:26 I‚Äôm not very good at making replicas.
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 02:39:13 Not really.
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 02:38:47 So details are....fine I guess
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 02:38:39 Well the amagi is massive
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 02:38:10 Okay then
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 02:38:03 ‚ÄúDetails can be great, but if done wrong will ruin a build‚Äù
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 02:37:30 Okay I guess the chassis was ugly for him
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 02:37:15 Lol rip
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 02:37:00 The barrel give me a rail gun vibe.
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 02:36:44 I like the turret
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 02:36:16 Wut
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 02:35:58 Actually
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 02:35:55 I‚Äôm not informed of ‚Äúhis turret‚Äù
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 02:35:41 Wut
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 02:35:09 Or maybe a ground vehicle? Like a car maybe
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 02:34:47 Like a dingy? Or a large dingy in this case
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 02:34:32 I might as well start off with a simple creation and try to make it look good.
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 02:33:50 Ah okay
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 02:33:31 Okay, maybe make a more interesting shape?
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 02:32:42 Better details = better looks?
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 02:32:26 Then again it‚Äôs a massive transition for me.
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 02:32:00 Yeah actually
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 02:31:42 Actually I‚Äôve been considering whether I should stop making pvp vehicles.
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 02:31:19 Oh.
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 02:30:58 Would you guys rather see something with better pvp capability or better looks?
plane-crazy 2019-10-21 08:38:19 Ima leave for a bit bai
plane-crazy 2019-10-21 08:37:47 Nice
plane-crazy 2019-10-21 08:37:08 Meh...
plane-crazy 2019-10-21 08:36:57 Okay
plane-crazy 2019-10-21 08:36:37 Whatever...
plane-crazy 2019-10-21 08:36:15 Tbh I'm more interested in sharing creations than ranks.
plane-crazy 2019-10-21 08:35:26 Lol whatever I'll deal with that later
plane-crazy 2019-10-21 08:35:17 I realise I can get some ranks already
plane-crazy 2019-10-21 08:35:08 Well uhhhh
plane-crazy 2019-10-21 08:34:37 Nice
plane-crazy 2019-10-21 08:34:05 I'll try to take notice when they start
plane-crazy 2019-10-21 08:33:51 Cool then.
plane-crazy 2019-10-21 08:33:31 Oh...
plane-crazy 2019-10-21 08:33:02 Whatever I probably don't need ranks.
plane-crazy 2019-10-21 08:32:23 What's good about ranks.
plane-crazy 2019-10-21 03:30:03 yeah you do need less wings and more and better placed control surfaces
plane-crazy 2019-10-21 03:29:10 because game physics yes
plane-crazy 2019-10-21 03:28:54 well non winged craft seem more maneuverable and fast.
plane-crazy 2019-10-21 03:28:27 it's also winged
plane-crazy 2019-10-21 03:28:20 I have a plane that reaches about 400SPS and it is so maneuverable that I have trouble shooting with it.
plane-crazy 2019-10-21 03:27:14 somewhat yes
plane-crazy 2019-10-21 03:26:14 jesus christ it's jason borne
plane-crazy 2019-10-21 03:25:24 anything slow it seems.
plane-crazy 2019-10-21 03:25:14 helicopters are kinda vunerable to tnt planes
plane-crazy 2019-10-21 03:24:34 ik I have a bomber with a rear turret
plane-crazy 2019-10-21 03:24:25 new idea
plane-crazy 2019-10-21 03:24:14 oh....thats new.
plane-crazy 2019-10-21 03:22:47 well a turret doesnt seem enough...
plane-crazy 2019-10-21 03:21:41 yeah seems like it üò¶
plane-crazy 2019-10-21 03:21:26 it's hard for ships and tanks to do that though.
plane-crazy 2019-10-21 03:21:14 ik
plane-crazy 2019-10-21 03:21:10 actually anything that's not a land or naval vehicle
plane-crazy 2019-10-21 03:20:40 well they'll hit you first
plane-crazy 2019-10-21 03:19:54 properly
plane-crazy 2019-10-21 03:19:50 well if only there was a way to shoot them down
plane-crazy 2019-10-21 03:19:00 yeah
plane-crazy 2019-10-21 03:18:50 yeah but most of the time they'll destroy you
plane-crazy 2019-10-21 03:18:19 I wish there was a proper way to counter tnt planes....
plane-crazy 2019-10-21 03:17:16 how does that counter tnt planes
plane-crazy 2019-10-21 03:17:10 :/
plane-crazy 2019-10-21 03:17:02 wait that's it?
plane-crazy 2019-10-21 03:16:41 Anyone know how to make a spinning cutter?
plane-crazy 2019-10-21 03:09:16 I guess nobody knows how to make a spinning cutter.
plane-crazy 2019-10-21 03:05:39 how do you build a spinning cutter?
plane-crazy 2019-10-21 02:50:53 anyone know how to counter tnt fitted planes?
plane-crazy 2019-10-21 02:12:31 the center of thrust is lower than the center of mass?
plane-crazy 2019-10-21 02:12:15 seems like it.
plane-crazy 2019-10-21 02:10:52 ur ship is somehow capable of doing that perfectly.
plane-crazy 2019-10-21 01:47:59 lmao
plane-crazy 2019-10-21 01:47:33 yeah
plane-crazy 2019-10-21 01:47:29 a character from uhhh
plane-crazy 2019-10-21 01:47:20 is that pfp uhhhh...
plane-crazy 2019-10-21 01:42:42 BRUH üòÇ
plane-crazy 2019-10-21 01:41:04 *sees transparent blocks*
BRUH
plane-crazy 2019-10-18 06:00:54 Meh...
plane-crazy 2019-10-18 06:00:20 What‚Äôs even good about ranks anyway
plane-crazy 2019-10-18 00:06:36 and it's winged
plane-crazy 2019-10-18 00:06:11 especially the aircraft I had that could reach 500+ and still outmaneuver most aerodynamic craft
plane-crazy 2019-10-18 00:05:25 I don't post creations because most of mine r highly experimental
plane-crazy 2019-10-18 00:05:09 usually anyway
plane-crazy 2019-10-18 00:04:59 I'd probably try making something hard to make.
plane-crazy 2019-10-18 00:04:20 that seems normal
plane-crazy 2019-10-18 00:04:15 yeah...if i ever made a mech I'd probably use a new method of walking instead.
plane-crazy 2019-10-18 00:03:21 rip
plane-crazy 2019-10-18 00:03:10 it's too experimental
plane-crazy 2019-10-18 00:03:06 exactly my point.
plane-crazy 2019-10-18 00:02:48 also even if I made one it might lack features like turning
plane-crazy 2019-10-18 00:02:16 I've never quite made a mech because I don't have confidence to make one that can ACTUALLY WALK
plane-crazy 2019-10-18 00:01:53 lol
plane-crazy 2019-10-18 00:00:56 lol oof
plane-crazy 2019-10-18 00:00:31 which is seemingly impossible
plane-crazy 2019-10-18 00:00:22 if only I could make some mech that can walk like an actual person
plane-crazy 2019-10-17 23:59:50 I guess so.
plane-crazy 2019-10-17 23:59:30 well wheels would be a bit too easy
plane-crazy 2019-10-17 23:59:20 legs
plane-crazy 2019-10-17 23:58:58 The question is, how do you make a mech walk like a mech
plane-crazy 2019-10-17 07:59:29 lol his craft is sorta trolly
plane-crazy 2019-10-17 05:26:06 Ohai
plane-crazy 2019-10-14 07:41:17 okay hard to make
plane-crazy 2019-10-14 07:41:00 wao neat
plane-crazy 2019-10-14 07:40:33 idk why we need them
plane-crazy 2019-10-14 07:40:28 tbh I'm not planning on any role
plane-crazy 2019-10-14 07:40:17 what's crazy inventor
plane-crazy 2019-10-14 07:40:09 how does ur ship NOT flip over
plane-crazy 2019-10-14 07:39:49 balance
plane-crazy 2019-10-14 07:39:45 how do u
plane-crazy 2019-10-14 07:39:17 crumpled ship
plane-crazy 2019-10-14 07:38:49 nvm not corvette
plane-crazy 2019-10-14 07:38:42 I'm guessing it's some sort of corvette?
plane-crazy 2019-10-14 07:38:01 wdym
plane-crazy 2019-10-14 07:37:55 wut
plane-crazy 2019-10-14 07:37:03 ;-;
plane-crazy 2019-10-14 07:36:57 I don't?
plane-crazy 2019-10-14 07:36:36 well how do u solve the movement problem?
plane-crazy 2019-10-14 07:36:27 darn
plane-crazy 2019-10-14 07:35:57 well u guys have problems with lag that causes ur vehicle to move slow?
plane-crazy 2019-10-14 07:35:31 it's some sort of battleship right?
plane-crazy 2019-10-14 07:34:49 my largest creation has 3 folds
plane-crazy 2019-10-14 07:34:38 I'm a noob at this.
plane-crazy 2019-10-14 07:34:23 hmmmm
plane-crazy 2019-10-14 07:33:24 ohhhh nvm then
plane-crazy 2019-10-14 07:33:20 wait how'd you exceed it?
plane-crazy 2019-10-14 07:33:11 save space
plane-crazy 2019-10-14 07:32:59 how much space do u guys have
plane-crazy 2019-10-14 07:32:43 lol
plane-crazy 2019-10-14 07:32:19 oml
plane-crazy 2019-10-14 07:32:16 4k? woah
plane-crazy 2019-10-14 07:32:12 lol definetely cool looking
plane-crazy 2019-10-14 07:31:09 darn rip
plane-crazy 2019-10-14 07:30:46 it's still dying
plane-crazy 2019-10-14 07:30:28 fortnite might never die....but I hope it stays this way
plane-crazy 2019-10-14 07:28:51 I just don't know what will happen to the map...or the platform where the plots will be on will change.
plane-crazy 2019-10-14 07:28:23 A plot enlargement update would be awesome
plane-crazy 2019-10-10 07:58:43 why not make ur own yamato :/
plane-crazy 2019-10-10 07:58:00 what is that
plane-crazy 2019-10-09 01:22:11 wut is going on
plane-crazy 2019-10-09 01:22:03 wut
plane-crazy 2019-10-09 01:21:39 Ohai
plane-crazy 2019-10-08 07:07:30 hai
plane-crazy 2019-10-08 07:07:27 hmmmmm
plane-crazy 2019-09-22 11:10:49 and it seems impossible
plane-crazy 2019-09-22 11:10:44 it's not like ur wrong cuz ive tried that for so long
plane-crazy 2019-09-22 11:10:27 oh well
plane-crazy 2019-09-22 11:10:24 ;-;
plane-crazy 2019-09-22 11:09:58 i can't?
plane-crazy 2019-09-22 11:09:45 like an air to air missile
plane-crazy 2019-09-22 11:09:32 wait i don't mean pilot guided missile
plane-crazy 2019-09-22 11:08:34 oh
plane-crazy 2019-09-22 11:08:06 no i mean...the biggest problem is the guidance system
plane-crazy 2019-09-22 11:07:39 how do people do it?
plane-crazy 2019-09-22 11:07:28 multiple? geez
plane-crazy 2019-09-22 11:07:08 has anyone ever made an automatic guided homing missile?
plane-crazy 2019-09-22 10:53:30 well that was only expected
plane-crazy 2019-09-22 10:50:00 did magnets used to interact with other player's vehicles?
plane-crazy 2019-09-22 10:49:15 i kinda had a test with someone in my server....magnets don't seem to react to anyone else's build
plane-crazy 2019-09-22 10:48:45 why does it seem people r unsure?
plane-crazy 2019-09-22 10:48:24 can magnets interact with another player's build?
plane-crazy 2019-07-06 03:24:45 not exactly freeze but the engine stops working, the torpedo can still be pushed
plane-crazy 2019-07-06 03:24:30 when u do tho....the result is that it'll move for a while and then the engine will stop working and the torpedo will freeze too
plane-crazy 2019-07-06 03:24:00 weII i found out what happens when u lock the position of an object, then launch something unanchored
plane-crazy 2019-07-06 03:23:10 it stops providing thrust for the torpedo
plane-crazy 2019-07-06 03:23:00 i mean the engine just stops working but you can hear the noise of the engine
plane-crazy 2019-07-06 03:22:29 is that a bug?
plane-crazy 2019-07-06 03:22:24 ive been trying to build a torpedo on my heli and while that i found that if u use an anchor block the torpedo's engine might fail.
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 09:54:13 Lol
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 09:53:54 I mean fungamer
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 09:53:49 I do recognise you
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 09:53:39 Whatever
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 09:53:34 Figorboy...Sounds familiar
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 09:53:17 Wait a min...
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 09:53:08 Hello there.
