the-dump 2021-07-26 14:01:12 What?
the-dump 2021-07-26 14:04:48 Its not exactly a board game

the-dump 2021-07-26 18:17:34 I wonder if this server is actually run by the current German government
the-dump 2021-07-26 18:19:44 So if we were to follow the rules letter by letter, this is not allowed in the server?
the-dump 2021-07-26 18:21:09 So the owners are actually the current German Government
the-dump 2021-07-26 18:31:20 
the-dump 2021-07-26 18:32:01 Oh no!
the-dump 2021-07-26 18:32:05 Anyway!

help 2021-07-27 11:02:27 I’m trying to convert my planes from mobile based into laptop/pc based planes. What keybinds should I use for the basic controls?

help 2021-07-27 11:17:29 Ok I’ll give that a go
help 2021-07-27 11:56:30 You’d be better off using motors and engine type blocks instead

creations-chat 2021-07-27 14:14:02 As long I get to keep the hole for the landing gear I’m fine. 

Also are you referring to the bit where I placed the Elevator mechanism?
creations-chat 2021-07-27 14:21:53 I think it’s a pretty decent build, ignoring the fact that it says “cat girls inside”

creations-chat 2021-07-27 15:41:32 I saw some other people do it so I thought i was supposed to do it.

Thanks for clarifying that <:trollface:775024642104229898>
help 2021-07-27 16:12:53 A lil bit difficult when I can’t hear it. But anyway
help 2021-07-27 16:18:15 Why are my wings no longer moving with the motors? (Highlighted in red).

Neither the wings nor the motors should be welded to anything that it shouldn’t be so I have no idea what’s going on.
the-dump 2021-07-30 09:34:55 It went on a camping trip
bug-reports 2021-07-30 17:51:01 I mean it is a sort of insult. Is it not?
the-dump 2021-07-30 17:54:06 No
the-dump 2021-07-30 22:31:12 I guess that’s kinda true
creations-chat 2021-07-30 22:32:46 Piss
the-dump 2021-07-31 14:52:23 So basically an antiaircraft net?

Ki-43-I (“Ko”) “Hayabusa”
creations-chat 2021-08-01 21:51:51 I’d say the green is too bright as is grey on the tracks. Perhaps make it a more darker, dull colour. 
Alternatively you could opt for a dull tan colour which would also suit it well.
creations-chat 2021-08-01 21:56:48 However for its tiny size it is pretty good, the engine deck may need a bit of elongating the turret is fine….ish? But I guess you did as well as you could with the small scale.
creations-chat 2021-08-01 22:00:44 If somehow you managed to make the turret a little less….crap….you could be able to pass it off as a Sherman 105

creations-chat 2021-08-01 22:24:56 Ehh some feedback, anyone? For this mobile - PC conversion?
help 2021-08-01 22:25:23 Perhaps increasing the torque may help
help 2021-08-01 22:27:04 Oh
creations-chat 2021-08-01 22:34:40 Well ok then.

Also, Dave, I think the colours aren’t that bad. They could be better, yes, certainly. But they aren’t terrible. And they are not *wildly* inaccurate. The rest of it…. Well I can agree more with those points
help 2021-08-01 22:36:14 You could use an image - RGB converter thingamajig online to find such a colour. If you really wanted to

creations-chat 2022-09-17 20:41:41 How can I make this better?
creations-chat 2022-09-17 20:45:11 There’s photo mode?
creations-chat 2022-09-17 20:48:26 I probably should’ve clarified what I meant by “better”, as what I meant was landing gear and the design of the plane itself, it’s decent but I’m not really satisfied with it.

The Landing gear especially
creations-chat 2022-09-17 20:52:30 It’s both by default, the gear doesn’t fold properly into the wing normally but if I try to motor lock it, the wheels are not free, so it just nosedives on takeoff
help 2022-09-18 14:18:32 I’m trying to build a 2-wide fuselage but I don’t know how to make this section of the plane flushed as the gap is 0.5x0.5, and the only thing that fits is the small half wedge.
help 2022-09-18 14:25:56 Yeah….could you maybe elaborate on that? Because I have no idea how to make it fit in a 2-wide space.
help 2022-09-18 14:28:52 Hold on a minut
help 2022-09-18 14:30:12 
help 2022-09-18 14:30:17 There
help 2022-09-18 14:38:13 Well I mean, I didn’t think I’d need a *complicated motor lock for the roof
help 2022-09-18 14:54:09 It kind of works…
help 2022-09-18 14:55:17 Yeah it works

creations-chat 2022-09-19 09:57:49 I am in my own hell
creations-chat 2022-09-19 11:52:28 How’s this for compact landing gear, is it good or bad?
creations-chat 2022-09-19 11:56:34 I don’t know yet, but in theory it should. This is after all a test rig which should simulate how it works on the aircraft I’m working on
help 2022-09-19 16:47:00 I’ve been trying for a couple hours now but I have no idea how to make this work
help 2022-09-19 16:49:34 If I make the doors open, the landing gear will look a bit scuffed, but the doors don’t exactly work because the 1/2cylinders are trying to trying to become one
help 2022-09-19 16:53:07 And well, I did get it working at one point but  uh there’s quite a substantial gap in the fuselage
help 2022-09-19 16:53:45 Should I just give up
help 2022-09-19 17:09:54 Screw it I’ll go with the scuffed 1-wheel per-side  setup
creations-chat 2022-09-20 00:00:06 I was looking through Supermarine’s designs and accidentally found some truly weird designs.
The 559 looked pretty cool to me.
creations-chat 2022-09-20 00:09:04 I found it to be a good way to practice multiple motor locks since this build needed a lot of them.
…..Since almost none of you seem to like it, some critiques would be great….regarding the accuracy. ~~Go complain to vickers if you don’t like the actual design~~ <:trollface:775024642104229898>
creations-chat 2022-09-22 00:50:21 I’ve seen worse…
But the centre mounted ailerons are blasphemous, the cockpit could do with some glass and the canards could do with (at least) a slight redesign. Other than that I’d say it’s just decent
