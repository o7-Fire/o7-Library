creations-chat 2022-09-18 16:55:12 i thought somebody would be willing to actually say what i could do to fix it or help me but all i get is hate. plane crazy has a shit community and i pretty much give up after this. its gonna take a 50000 block build with loads of angle lock and precicion just to mildly impress you guys

I dont care if they say watch a tut cos all tuts do are make you follow it for 10 minutes for you to mess up one thing and the whole thing is done for. Anyway i quit bye
help 2022-09-18 17:11:26 i doesnt fly well as in when it goes fast its a tiny bit wiggly when handling also when it goes slow it struggles to turn
help 2022-09-18 17:12:32 that makes the handling worse
help 2022-09-18 17:14:57 i spent 3 hours on it and i literally cant change it rn
creations-chat 2022-09-18 17:15:57 block was off set but 0.5 so it would look like the roof was half detached

help 2022-09-19 14:59:23 good or nah for my 3rd motorlock plane
help 2022-09-19 14:59:57 tailwings
help 2022-09-19 15:00:06 it increases handling
help 2022-09-19 15:01:02 look at the image see how they are tilted i find it really helps the stability and handling
help 2022-09-19 15:02:17 yeah my bad idrk what parts of a plane are
help 2022-09-19 15:02:23 but what do u think

bug-reports 2022-10-09 19:59:22 plane crazy is the only game affected as well
bug-reports 2022-10-09 19:59:31 literally any other game is fine
creations-chat 2022-10-19 17:21:22 
creations-chat 2022-10-19 17:23:31 supposed to be a hawker harrier but went wrong but its just a random thing to get my motorlock and angle lock to work
creations-chat 2022-10-19 17:25:50 Im jut starting to get the hang of motorlock but i need to make omething good with it any ideas? i only really know a few things but it can make stuff with it not like massive vehicles or anything
creations-chat 2022-10-19 17:28:53 also i managed to do this so im happy i guess with it
creations-chat 2022-10-19 17:34:03 ive played for 2 years but never really followed tuts cos i never seemed to be able to follow them but eventually its worked
creations-chat 2022-10-19 17:36:28 no dont worry lol also just did this
creations-chat 2022-10-19 17:47:49 my main has 11 days play time my alt has 6
creations-chat 2022-10-19 21:05:00 remade my new "RoScAlE" jet
creations-chat 2022-10-19 21:08:13 Well im not good at motorlock but this jet is a massive advancement for me.
creations-chat 2022-10-19 21:10:37 The motorlock is so the engine on back looks good also so it has more power
creations-chat 2022-10-19 21:12:42 it cant be used in pvp due to the amount of stupid op jets but its good for ground targets and looks in general
creations-chat 2022-10-19 21:15:36 easy for you to say since your a pro
help 2022-10-20 01:09:44 How to compact motorlock
help 2022-10-20 01:10:02 you can
help 2022-10-20 01:10:16 then if not how can you make motors invisible
help 2022-10-20 01:10:24 ^
help 2022-10-20 01:10:33 you can
help 2022-10-20 01:10:51 hold on i have a screenshot of this dude with a functioning character
help 2022-10-20 01:10:55 and its seamless
help 2022-10-20 01:11:43 the one on the left glitched out and lost body parts but that one has invisible motors
help 2022-10-20 01:11:52 i mean right
help 2022-10-20 01:12:28 nope i checked torso and nothing in it
help 2022-10-20 01:12:33 only 1 motor in head
help 2022-10-20 01:12:45 the mech thing is controlled from his plot
help 2022-10-20 01:12:53 so he uses like a no collision glitch
help 2022-10-20 01:13:09 idk
help 2022-10-20 01:13:12 ask them
help 2022-10-20 01:13:33 its so hard actually making motorlock fit on a plane
help 2022-10-20 01:13:52 this is like level 150 difficulty for me
help 2022-10-20 01:15:25 i know angle lock partially
help 2022-10-20 01:15:35 u freeze motorlock to turn something then lock it
help 2022-10-20 01:15:42 ikr
help 2022-10-20 01:15:52 but motorlock being compact is hard
help 2022-10-20 01:17:00 stuff like this
help 2022-10-20 01:17:03 how do they compact it
help 2022-10-20 01:19:25 yeah but how the hell the tracks lie that and everythign else all on one motorlock
help 2022-10-20 01:19:39 most i can get on one is an extra engine and some body
help 2022-10-20 01:20:22 best one to date
help 2022-10-20 01:21:36 yeahg but with massive towers theres one block that masees it all up and i just eventually give up trying to fix the isse
help 2022-10-20 01:21:51 i cant
help 2022-10-20 01:22:14 bruh this is why this server sucks
help 2022-10-20 01:22:22 i though <#478584971670454284> was to get help
help 2022-10-20 01:22:26 not to me made fun of
help 2022-10-20 01:22:47 i literally tried for an hour with a plane once and gave up
help 2022-10-20 01:23:26 yeah i know but most of the time u spend a week on a plane for ppl to say its ugly and it doesnt fly well or look good
help 2022-10-20 01:23:54 ive played like sice 2021
help 2022-10-20 01:24:00 and i can barely motorlock
help 2022-10-20 01:24:18 probably cos my stupid adhd gets in the way of everything
help 2022-10-20 01:25:26 i know this is angle lock but how with the tank tracks in that image
help 2022-10-20 01:25:59 how did he get it so the tracks somehow fit perfect
help 2022-10-20 01:27:08 yeah how did the motorlock not put the disconnectors all inside eachother
help 2022-10-20 01:27:14 cos when i do that it always does it
help 2022-10-20 01:28:43 basically if you put angle lock on a planes motorlock it locks the angle lock inside something but its literally impossible to have the angle lock stay on differnt layers its hard to explain
help 2022-10-20 01:29:00 what i mean is
help 2022-10-20 01:29:07 if it were my build
help 2022-10-20 01:29:15 the tracks would clip inside eachother
help 2022-10-20 01:30:25 im just gonna draw an example
help 2022-10-20 01:32:45 
help 2022-10-20 01:32:52 thats all i can do
help 2022-10-20 01:32:56 best way to explain
help 2022-10-20 01:33:20 no
help 2022-10-20 01:33:26 bruh
help 2022-10-20 01:33:31 look at it
help 2022-10-20 01:33:39 the angle lock would clip inside the bottom tnk track
help 2022-10-20 01:34:37 image an angle lock attached to the motor if u locked it would clip inside the bottom tank track thing
help 2022-10-20 01:37:19 
help 2022-10-20 01:37:30 if u cant understand i give up
help 2022-10-20 01:37:37 i would have to show u ingame otherwise
creations-chat 2022-10-20 01:39:50 no cos how the hell is motorlock that compact
help 2022-10-20 01:40:35 what im saying is the top part of the tank track would be inside the bottom part of the tank track
help 2022-10-20 01:41:00 also if compact motorlock dont exist
help 2022-10-20 01:41:03 
help 2022-10-20 01:42:47 ok then but im serious the guy in my server has a mech that literally had no motors in the torso and was brobablt only 4x bigger than a roblox player i think it was a protogen mech
help 2022-10-20 01:44:14 it had detail
help 2022-10-20 01:44:30 it could sit down walk better than most mechs it could move its head and ect
help 2022-10-20 01:44:38 lemme show u an image
help 2022-10-20 01:44:45 ill find it
help 2022-10-20 01:46:41 one on the right but imagine its limbs didnt glitch off and they were attached almost on the body
