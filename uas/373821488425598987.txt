bug-reports 2020-12-20 17:05:42 ok so heres the problem that my friend found: ROBLOX Error Code 267 is an error which is displayed when a user gets kicked from a game using a script that basically includes admin commands.

Basically, ROBLOX is not responsible for this error. Rather the main reason behind this error is due to an illegal insertion of script by the game developer.
