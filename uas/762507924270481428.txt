help 2023-06-02 10:39:13 itâ€™s very severe and my plane canâ€™t fly straight
help 2023-06-02 10:50:12 Well it appears to be because my motors canâ€™t stay in a neutral position and wonâ€™t stay still
help 2023-06-02 10:50:21 they are either moving up or down
help 2023-06-02 10:52:34 if I try holding my mouse at the horizon perfectly the rudders and ailerons are always moving up and down they canâ€™t just stay neutral
