help 2018-11-24 12:42:01 Hmm, for that I don't think that could be possible right now. Maybe in future, you would use motors and 'TRED' blocks to make tank treds.

help 2018-11-29 12:20:15 <@!383826315339628544>  The ship's angle of tilt is based on the centre of mass. If it is centred, it should not face any issues regarding angle of tilt
help 2018-11-29 12:23:21 Also, if the centre of mass were to be located over a thinner base, any adjustment that would lead to the centre of mass leaning over that base, would cause the object to fall over, or in this case, capsize.
help 2018-11-29 12:25:04 Here is a representation of this basic concept:
help 2018-11-29 12:26:24 The smart car has leant over its base, thus meaning it topples over on to its side. However, the supercar has not leant over its base, and will, in fact, fall back onto its wheels, as it too is over the base
help 2018-11-29 12:27:58 if the supercar were to have its COM over the point at which the wheel makes contact with the floor, it should not topple over unless acted upon by an opposing force, greater than the force keeping the object stable.
help 2018-11-29 12:28:11 i.e 0
help 2018-11-29 13:12:07 My first thought was that you could make the base wider by adding extendable floats underwater... oof nvm then
help 2018-11-29 13:12:26 my catamaran is a bit heavy... I NEED HELIUM!
creations-chat 2018-12-01 12:29:46 What do we all think?
