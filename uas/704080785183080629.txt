The Tale of itzstorm. (704080785183080629)
creations-chat 2022-06-04 06:16:08 My builds never look good but they *usually* have functionality
creations-chat 2022-08-11 14:25:12 Just add wings to it and call it the gliding express <:trollface:775024642104229898>
creations-chat 2022-10-04 13:27:42 You could theoretically use stretched springs (for tension) because they have no collision and just make a compressed motor setup, sort of like a chain link if it had a pivot and one part could pass through the other
creations-chat 2022-10-20 13:29:58 I dunno if you care, but actual airplane windows are rounded to reduce stress on the windows (that would be hell to implement though)
creations-chat 2022-10-20 13:33:42 exactly why I said it would be hell to implement (f e e d b a c k)
creations-chat 2022-10-24 15:49:33 I’m not good at building in PC, (thus I don’t have a rank) but at least I can respect a good build (phantom)  also, why are there 3 downvotes now
creations-chat 2022-10-24 15:52:15 fair enough (I’m shit at designing and building so anything that looks at least half decent is good in my books)
creations-chat 2022-10-24 15:54:25 I’m the guy who will put 2 swashplates on a parallel rotor setup and expect it to work (it does) <:clueless:942802644043464734>
creations-chat 2022-10-24 15:57:33 whenever I make stuff I just try to logically figure out how another person did it better ,then rebuild a shittier version from the ground up (with some bad locking because y e s)
creations-chat 2022-10-24 16:00:32 anything mechanical on a heavily motor locked build sounds like wizardry to me bc I barely know anything about *how* to do average locking
creations-chat 2022-10-24 16:03:00 ~~sabotage tactics~~ <:clueless:942802644043464734>    <@867429158330302514> why downvote
creations-chat 2022-11-17 22:27:59 can’t you make the bomb arm on the drop key? (I could be an idiot and be missing something but i tried)
creations-chat 2022-11-30 19:06:04 I think it is (rocket banks that look like flywheels)
creations-chat 2022-12-01 14:33:38 meme build incarnate
creations-chat 2022-12-13 14:03:33 on the note of that, I wonder if it’s possible to make elliptical orbits (such as in the alpha centuri system) I mean you could probably do it with ropes but that would be boring to time
creations-chat 2022-12-14 13:59:31 you could maybe get it to work using a variable speed motor setup, if that’s even possible? or a weak strength spring as a slight attracting force (although I dunno how you can emulate the changing speeds of an elliptical orbit)
creations-chat 2023-01-11 22:32:17 i cant say that because barely (if anything) of mine is “better” (just a me-skill-issue-thing though)    <@1005644272541892609> the expectations in creations can fluctuate but they expect something to look at least half decent before they call it good
creations-chat 2023-02-01 17:49:24 you could try fitting it directly up from where you are trying to make it now (so there is more horizontal space
creations-chat 2023-02-01 17:51:49 oh well, it was worth a shot
creations-chat 2023-03-29 21:38:10 I think you have to have a certain level with hyperbot (in other words, conversate with others or sorta just exist around the discord for a while)
creations-chat 2023-04-30 15:13:35 you were the one who was shitting on someone else’s build (from a reply chain)
creations-chat 2023-04-30 15:18:29 I think the worst part is that he is malding about being judged but then he judged others <:trollface:775024642104229898>
creations-chat 2023-06-20 22:53:08 I probably can’t help this conversation in any meaningful way (as I’m a whitename) but it’s stupid to try to criticize people for a topic that you don’t have experience in (as you have no colored role)
creations-chat 2023-06-20 22:55:09 I wasn’t siding with you, I was explaining how to an outsider your arguments make little to no sense
creations-chat 2023-06-20 22:57:12 ok he is making literally no sense now, so I’m gonna remove myself from this conversation before it gets out of hand
creations-chat 2023-06-20 23:03:52 it would be funny but people would come up with alternatives (like colorlessname) or use something like the cyrillic keyboard for replacing the e or the i or something
creations-chat 2023-06-20 23:05:56 you get the point though right
creations-chat 2023-06-25 23:32:38 the more armored a ship the more brick-y it is
creations-chat 2023-06-29 12:28:54 scratch is a block coder made for like first graders, that thing they made is just to let them control it manually
creations-chat 2023-07-12 21:33:32 I would do this but it just so happens to be 110f (43c) outside and I don’t feel like cooking alive
