help 2022-11-21 07:00:28 lightweight but much power
help 2022-11-21 07:00:32 oh and trap doors
help 2022-11-21 07:00:54 people dont usually have that many wing panels on their planes
help 2022-11-21 07:01:28 it reduces drag and makes it more unstable when you replace wings with trap doors
help 2022-11-21 07:01:46 thats a good ting
help 2022-11-21 07:02:34 i have a good description for it
help 2022-11-21 07:03:41 its like making an arrow longer so that it goes more straight at fast speeds
help 2022-11-21 07:04:24 da

help 2022-11-21 07:07:09 how to explain
help 2022-11-21 07:08:52 personally id just pull a mikhail on a plain that isnt meant to have mikhails being pulled on
help 2022-11-21 07:08:57 and stall B)
help 2022-11-21 07:10:25 they have so much drop üò≠
help 2022-11-21 07:10:43 and the tracers show visual damage which sucks
help 2022-11-21 07:10:53 and the tracers have less drop
help 2022-11-21 07:11:12 and the tracers are affected by gravity shift but bullets are not
help 2022-11-21 07:12:49 then again guns r the reason people think they beat me then i pull up behind them and they die
help 2022-11-21 07:13:26 i put guns on my aircraft because they are supposed to have guns in that area so i make em functional
help 2022-11-21 07:14:02 wow it looked like there was resistance :0

help 2022-11-21 07:19:22 all at least 2 blocks from the ground..
help 2022-11-21 07:20:09 i dont think glitched works with motor 2
help 2022-11-21 07:21:38 cause motor 2 tracks where your cursor is aiming (w depth perception as well) and glitched moves according to where it is on your screen in a 2d plane
help 2022-11-21 07:21:40 plain*
help 2022-11-21 07:21:57 THATS CHEATING

creations-chat 2022-11-23 01:51:06 I based it off many different photos of supercars and hypercars... that I found in the images tab of google. The spoiler mechanism was part of the comission that I built it for and also it helps for cornering as well as straights where I needa be fast because we did race them on a track.
(Totally W sentances)
creations-chat 2022-11-23 01:54:47 The use of control panels prevent the wing from touching the motor and the signs stay in place because I superglued them to the body with text blocks.
creations-chat 2022-11-23 01:57:51 Indeed. There is a motorlock stack hiding inside of the car because I cannot build without them.

creations-chat 2022-12-01 04:49:58 Introducing... Piston lock!! Because I don't want to have good mental health stuff!!
creations-chat 2022-12-01 05:57:47 It‚Äôs not, I used it for the F-22 I gave up on and the F-14 that I accidentally saved over. It is, however the first time I‚Äôve had to fit it into a small space. The challenge is that I have to make it small so that all the parts of the completed A-10 body can fit.  I halso have to make room for the landing gear which just so happens to be right where the angle locking is so I have to fit all the stuff for the canopy and cockpit into the 1.5 blocks, which is not fun at all. I don‚Äôt use that extra 1.5 though, I just fit everything into a 1x1 motor death.
creations-chat 2022-12-01 12:50:40 A-10A
creations-chat 2022-12-01 14:41:42 Das cap if you visualize and do sum voodoo doodoo brain shit you can see that if the front canopy bit will be 2 blocks long then the nose should be 3 blocks long.

Yeah and I feel like it would be good if the wings were to be .5 block wider
(The correct way to take good criticism)
creations-chat 2022-12-07 22:10:47 Torque will always be an issue because the weight from the blades will cause the rest of the plane to spin

Main wingies could also be .5 blocks longer and the thicc part could be .5 like the angly part

help 2022-12-07 23:35:50 this requires purpose built but doesn't need any props
help 2022-12-07 23:37:22 actually this is possible to do without props i remember seeing someone making a propeller aircraft do it with no internal props that assist the motion
help 2022-12-07 23:39:00 He's too powerful, he even uses proper mouse control in that pulling the stick down make the plane go up and opposite the same (too lazy to pull out english)

help 2022-12-07 23:40:51 idk how to say it
help 2022-12-07 23:41:13 say ur flying a plane you pull the stick towards u
help 2022-12-07 23:41:46 but normally in plane crazy people opt to push the "stick" (cursor) away (up) to go up

creations-chat 2023-07-18 09:33:18 its more colour than the other submissions to the contract 
it was actually supposed to be medium grey all around
i just posted the finished product of my entry
creations-chat 2023-07-18 09:37:49 the theme was patrol cutter
creations-chat 2023-07-18 09:44:25 sure a contest

theres no point in me changing anything now since its already submitted i dont really care about the colours
i did notice when i first coloured it that the white made it hard to see details 
the curvature is much more satisfying in a darker colour

v half way through building threw on a darker grey colour to show more detail for an update photo
creations-chat 2023-07-18 09:48:53 how r u gonna tell me that a simple turret is hideous that part took me 5 minutes which is shorter than the time it took to place the wedges
creations-chat 2023-07-18 09:53:23 that is true but like i said its already submitted 
am also aready workin on sum carrier and i have a fighter jet cooking on paper
