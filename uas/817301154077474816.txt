creations-chat 2023-06-10 08:05:36 have any of you seen a porsche 919 hybrid in plane crazy or have made one before?
creations-chat 2023-06-10 08:10:10 trying to make some sort of le mans car, need some inspiration along with it
creations-chat 2023-06-10 08:13:30 sketchfab doesn't show plane crazy building techniques sadly, and i'm making a le mans hypercar, sumn like this or the audi R18
creations-chat 2023-06-10 08:41:10 show if you don't mind?
creations-chat 2023-06-10 08:43:34 mine's not exactly a 919, but it's somethin off of it, definetely a le mans car tho
creations-chat 2023-06-10 08:55:02 try updating your buildstyle, it's kinda blocky and outdated
creations-chat 2023-06-10 08:58:35 then i suggest to expect less from what the community will give, because in my opinion, this server (especially this chat) has lots of experienced builders, and of course they will judge from their own standards, which leads to a downvote
creations-chat 2023-06-10 09:02:20 then don't expect much, and don't ask "what's the problem" when you don't accept any form of advice of the renewal of your buildstyle (especially motorlocking which is vital to learn nowadays)
creations-chat 2023-06-10 09:07:02 majority of "good" builds consist of motor locking, sure some don't have it but high likeliness of it being larger scaled
creations-chat 2023-06-10 10:06:56 opinions?
creations-chat 2023-06-10 11:12:57 yeah i'm not using f3x sorry
creations-chat 2023-06-10 11:15:59 too lazy to remake but sure will do
creations-chat 2023-06-10 12:30:46 thoughts? + paint recommendations
creations-chat 2023-06-10 12:47:35 driver's compartment you mean? and i'll try that when i remake it, burnt myself out after speedrunning the whole thing for 6 hours

+ i think it'll be harder when you do that, especially with cylinders, because usually it looks smth like (hold on)
creations-chat 2023-06-10 12:49:55 see the top part? yeah angle locking is kinda tough especially in trying to replicate that specific part
creations-chat 2023-06-10 12:57:00 oh crap yeah smoke pipes
creations-chat 2023-06-10 13:31:52 thanks that helped a lot
creations-chat 2023-06-10 13:48:40 made the roof half a block instead at the cost of the circular intake
creations-chat 2023-06-10 13:51:21 actually that's a good idea for a next build, tho it won't be fully 9x8, but it can be inspired off of cuz it's relatively nice yet simple

(simple part is everywhere except the front and the intake

creations-chat 2023-06-10 14:41:41 jackson storm.
creations-chat 2023-06-10 14:58:37 eh that's not all too complicated
creations-chat 2023-06-10 15:01:16 tried it, looked bad
creations-chat 2023-06-10 16:00:04 sounds pcc enough
creations-chat 2023-06-10 16:44:00 does the rear look better like this?
creations-chat 2023-06-10 16:47:21 it's custom but this is what it was like earlier
creations-chat 2023-06-10 16:51:57 it's a diffuser? but cuz of pc physics it just gives it lift instead of downforce
creations-chat 2023-06-10 16:58:39 yeah done the ballast thing and thanks + added front lights
creations-chat 2023-06-10 18:14:23 
creations-chat 2023-06-11 03:28:16 yea i'll try to remake it with pontoons and stuff locked
creations-chat 2023-06-11 03:33:10 paintjob is because i have no artistic value
corners i don't get it
materials is understandable but don't know how to resolve it either
creations-chat 2023-06-11 03:35:16 i'll check it out
thanks mane üëç
creations-chat 2023-06-11 04:45:42 i tried the gulf livery, but for some reason something jammed the lock
gotta fix it rq then i'll show what i managed to do
creations-chat 2023-06-11 04:57:00 better system or lower block count
creations-chat 2023-06-11 05:09:15 fucked the gulf livery up by somehow jamming an unknown motor inside the build and now im too lazy to repaint it
creations-chat 2023-06-11 05:23:14 try taking better pictures
and your building isn't the best  so yeah
creations-chat 2023-06-11 05:26:09 maybe the first option is to increase your graphics for a moment
the other one is to just detail your build further
it takes time so don't worry
creations-chat 2023-06-11 05:28:19 bro asked me how and then said no, i never knew being arrogant was a way to improve
creations-chat 2023-06-11 05:30:49 if you don't care then don't talk about how the community dislikes your build man, it's really that simple to not care, but it makes you look like an idiot when you say "idc" awhilst at the same time wondering why your builds are getting downvoted

also nice tutorial
creations-chat 2023-06-11 07:04:42 does this look better off the original one
creations-chat 2023-06-11 08:44:06 bro i just realised i have the innovation labs colours üíÄ
creations-chat 2023-06-11 08:52:02 i dont see the explosive blocks inside it
creations-chat 2023-06-11 08:54:57 rahhhh
creations-chat 2023-06-11 16:25:34 idk better paint
creations-chat 2023-06-11 17:02:22 so real
creations-chat 2023-06-14 15:03:35 not really
a mix between the audi r18, 919, and custom features + paintjob inspired by the cadillac v (specifically the shark fin)
creations-chat 2023-06-14 15:55:07 haven't been on in a while anyways
life matters
