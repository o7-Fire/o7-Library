~~Technically they're too big but I couldn't get it any smaller~~
creations-chat 2021-04-03 23:51:54 What colour should I paint the tracks
~~Also how do I stop it from wiggling from side to side on the suspension~~
creations-chat 2021-05-29 18:01:45 <@456226577798135808> you mean Object 726?
creations-chat 2021-05-29 18:08:34 Right that's object 726, WG just decided to call it 279e
279 was developed with lessons learned from 726, but it was a different project
~~in fact they introduced 279e as 726 at first, but I guess giving it the ufo tank name made it more appealing or something~~
