alright cool
creations-chat 2022-01-15 22:54:56 unfinished thing, still motorlocking the wing, making main gear rn and keep in mind this is my first non tutorial build so im not very experienced in creating custom stuff

creations-chat 2022-02-27 05:13:47 i dont think this tail shape is doing so good (this is a mig29 for reference)

bug-reports 2022-02-27 22:29:20 sorry didnt know
bug-reports 2022-02-27 23:04:38 sorry
creations-chat 2022-02-28 19:09:09 My slightly unfinished mig29 (first attempt at using motorlocks)
creations-chat 2022-02-28 19:11:10 If I can find the one I sent to someone else as it’s in my computer and I’m not home yet
creations-chat 2022-02-28 19:16:36 It has some exposed motorlock on the top but I don’t think it’s too bad to have to cover up
creations-chat 2022-02-28 19:48:46 Mk thanks I’ll try and fix it once I get home
creations-chat 2022-02-28 19:51:00 And the elevens are unfinished and just there for flight testing rn because I wanted to see if it could fly well first

creations-chat 2022-03-03 20:03:05 The easiest way would be to fold the tails and wings up and motorlock the center wing down possibly

creations-chat 2022-03-23 18:55:05 Drone thing that I’m in the middle of finishing, and yes I need to add detail to the engine that’s the part that’s in the middle of a revamp but it’s not supposed to be a rq4 while it’s based off it it’s mostly a custom design
creations-chat 2022-03-23 19:11:47 It’s based of the rq4 if that answers the intake question, also that’s what I mean by engine I’m reworking that rn
creations-chat 2022-03-23 19:13:52 The exposed motors are mainly for angling the stabilizers and elevators and ailerons, I’m not good at hiding stuff as this is my 4th plane and 2nd motorlocked build
creations-chat 2022-03-23 19:15:54 Did you even read the end of the description of the plane ITS MOSTLY A CUSTOM DESIGN JUST PARTIALLY BASED OFF THE RQ4 SO ITS NOT GONNA LOOK LIKE IT Thanks for the feedback though I’ll try and fix up a few things
creations-chat 2022-03-23 19:18:06 Are you talking about my build? It’s a plane….. that’s what I thought, edited it
creations-chat 2022-03-23 19:21:02 I’m not trying to excuse it I’m fixing the stuff he mentioned rn but I have a lack of skill as this is my 4th build and my 2nd motorlocked build
creations-chat 2022-03-23 19:31:24 how about instead of being a dumbass and just flaming my build you give me constructive criticism and feedback so i can FIX THE ISSUES WITH THE BUILD
creations-chat 2022-03-23 19:36:12 ?
creations-chat 2022-03-23 19:41:05 ok then
