creations-chat 2022-11-13 01:22:16 Welp...
creations-chat 2022-11-13 01:24:21 i tried to do a video for tank suspension on the creations chat, nothing worked. not even basic attached files, nor a URL due to the channel-bot saying (image only) yet there are videos in past chat, and text in those chats, so I'm going to upload it here instead, due to the glitchy madness. https://streamable.com/e/1d6dj0
creations-chat 2022-11-13 01:33:23 OMG LOL
creations-chat 2022-11-13 01:35:54 (I just wasted 2 minutes that I could have just been writing a meassage; I do not like slow mode one bit.) [continuing the "omg lol", I would say {I MANAGED TO CONVERT THE WMV FILE TO MP4 AND IT IS .1MB BEFORE IT IS OVER 8MB!}]

creations-chat 2022-11-13 01:50:37 I ask again, is it okay if i upload on my alt and send an image proving i own my alt (as it is not on my rust_6614 account)

creations-chat 2022-11-13 01:59:54 so you are targeting noobs.
creations-chat 2022-11-13 02:03:33 lol, funny joke (not). the goal of whitenames are to become other names, so they can become an expert, or anything else, if everyone downvotes a single thing due to :whitename: the moderators cannot give the role due to having too many downvotes. It is also not funny <@545785816127897611> neither is it funny <@939960830181642330> and <@1029091633037328404>
creations-chat 2022-11-13 02:06:28 They do not even view the video before they downvote, so what is the point of not posting cringe stuff, if they dont even know if its cringe or not...
creations-chat 2022-11-13 02:10:18 Nerd means someone who is smart, but might be weird in ways, I take that as a compliment as you are saying I am smart, a nerd can mean they look weird, but the inside of someone is better than the outside, and i know you are going to do another nerd gif as I have posted a long paragraph of a message.
