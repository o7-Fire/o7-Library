creations-chat 2021-10-22 03:19:47 So I was gonna upload more images and then my internet just legit dies
creations-chat 2021-10-30 20:08:58 How are y'all still posting creations?
creations-chat 2021-10-30 20:12:55 But how? I'm still logged out still with the classic "we're making things more awesome. Be back soon"
creations-chat 2021-10-30 20:15:54 Guess that makes sense..
creations-chat 2021-12-03 16:13:20 It's good enough-- But I'm sure somebody else could do better
creations-chat 2022-01-01 07:08:03 Thank strangers on the internet. That thing is legit the only thing that keeps me alive during the summer. I strapped a battery pack to it as well, so I can take it anywhere lol.
creations-chat 2022-01-01 08:07:40 Thank
creations-chat 2022-02-04 23:29:37 Any advise for my hatch I made?
creations-chat 2022-02-04 23:40:27 This is a lot more than I expected.
creations-chat 2022-02-04 23:42:45 Thanks, Don't think there's a lot more I can do about the blocky frame, I   **m i g h t**   be able to change something about the windshield same with door handles, rims, and exhausts. Oh, and the hole in the roof is so I can...y'know... get in and out of the car
creations-chat 2022-02-04 23:46:19 Good idea for the trap doors, but motor locking scares me lol. Might add some depth to the headlights I guess aswell!
creations-chat 2022-02-05 00:50:01 Okie, done most all the changes you said. added a little bit of shape to the windshield, added rims, 3D headlights and made the car look a little less blocky. Whatcha think?
creations-chat 2022-02-05 00:52:19 Motor lock scares me, also I don't really wanna change the overall look of the car, I like how it is right now.
creations-chat 2022-02-05 00:54:43 Also might I add motor lock requires a ton of space normally of which I don't have much of in this build so-
creations-chat 2022-02-05 01:02:03 Dang really? Guess I could try. Probably would make it look a good bit better
creations-chat 2022-02-05 01:10:27 Better?
creations-chat 2022-02-05 01:16:03 Really making feel better, thanks...
creations-chat 2022-02-05 01:23:22 Mine is just a mix of all sorts of different hatchbacks from the 2000's       I could try to do that at some point, but I'm pretty happy with what I have now.
creations-chat 2022-02-18 18:35:17 Any suggestions for the lil pickup truck? And don't tell me just to add motor lock, I ain't doing that. Thank you for that very helpful suggestion.
creations-chat 2022-03-19 07:40:11 Wait what?
I'm sorry man, I'll remove it if you want. I didn't know lol. Well that sucks, this go away after a while or is this just my life now?
creations-chat 2022-03-19 07:42:51 I'm just sayin' Who flippin reads the rules?
creations-chat 2022-03-19 08:00:06 Thank you everyone, I think I understand now. please continue talking to me. It gives me a reason to live. Please continue.
