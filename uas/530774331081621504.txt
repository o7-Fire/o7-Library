creations-chat 2019-05-06 17:32:22 its called recreation
creations-chat 2019-05-06 17:32:42 it requires skill to recreate things
creations-chat 2019-05-06 17:32:44 in this game
creations-chat 2019-05-06 17:32:50 you clearly have none
creations-chat 2019-05-06 17:33:07 as you decide to make these no effort gun spam things
creations-chat 2019-05-06 17:33:33 it really isn't
creations-chat 2019-05-06 17:33:45 no
creations-chat 2019-05-06 17:34:03 loads of people make these terrible gun spam turrets
creations-chat 2019-05-06 17:34:17 its the same thing
creations-chat 2019-05-06 17:34:22 just all the guns in one place
creations-chat 2019-05-06 17:34:37 yes it is
creations-chat 2019-05-06 17:34:58 its not hard kek
creations-chat 2019-05-06 17:35:04 you just add helium
creations-chat 2019-05-06 17:35:23 it really is not original
creations-chat 2019-05-06 17:35:39 if nobody else did it you would get modeler
creations-chat 2019-05-06 17:36:01 you prove to me that your shitty blue stick with a ball of guns is original
creations-chat 2019-05-06 17:36:46 why would anyone want to build something like that
creations-chat 2019-05-06 17:37:27 you clearly do
creations-chat 2019-05-06 17:38:07 what the people that skillfuly recreated ww2 ships?
creations-chat 2019-05-06 17:39:23 its not original ffs
creations-chat 2019-05-06 17:40:06 being original is standing out, you are just following the trend of making bad weapon clusters
creations-chat 2019-05-06 17:41:06 you are still following the trend, making your shitty 'boat' unoriginal
creations-chat 2019-05-06 17:41:20 that doesnt even look like a boat
creations-chat 2019-05-06 17:43:41 new; fresh; inventive; novel:
creations-chat 2019-05-06 17:44:08 ^
creations-chat 2019-05-06 17:45:10 you might not take someones idea, but you come up with the same one. making it unoriginal
creations-chat 2019-05-06 17:45:26 by adding something that makes it stand out
creations-chat 2019-05-06 17:45:32 like i said before
creations-chat 2019-05-06 17:45:41 what you painted it blue?
creations-chat 2019-05-06 17:46:12 like i said before kek
creations-chat 2019-05-06 17:46:23 you wont get modeler for that thing
creations-chat 2019-05-06 17:46:43 you clearly do as you keep comming back

creations-chat 2019-05-06 17:47:30 oxford
creations-chat 2019-05-06 17:47:35 like you asked
creations-chat 2019-05-06 17:47:42 then ask for inventor
creations-chat 2019-05-06 17:48:43 ok then
creations-chat 2019-05-06 17:49:00 if i copy someone block for block but then add a half block on top
creations-chat 2019-05-06 17:49:04 is it original?
creations-chat 2019-05-06 17:49:20 but that is making a physical change
creations-chat 2019-05-06 17:49:26 so by your logic
creations-chat 2019-05-06 17:49:29 it is original
creations-chat 2019-05-06 17:49:31 yes
creations-chat 2019-05-06 17:49:49 no as we added half a block
creations-chat 2019-05-06 17:49:50 to it
creations-chat 2019-05-06 17:50:31 it is clearly not the same kek
creations-chat 2019-05-06 17:50:35 so it has to be original
creations-chat 2019-05-06 17:51:50 then what if i somehow get the same idea to make a boat like that block for block but i change only one block and i have not seen your one before, is it original?
creations-chat 2019-05-06 17:51:57 as you are saying its just copying
creations-chat 2019-05-06 17:52:30 my boat is different from others too
creations-chat 2019-05-06 17:52:53 but its not original as it is ww2 inspired
creations-chat 2019-05-06 17:53:18 then by your logic everything is original
creations-chat 2019-05-06 17:53:25 your logic doesnt make any sense
creations-chat 2019-05-06 17:53:34 you are contradicting yourself
creations-chat 2019-05-06 17:53:40 what if they never seen your build
creations-chat 2019-05-06 17:53:52 but made the same thing
creations-chat 2019-05-06 17:53:58 somehow
creations-chat 2019-05-06 17:54:08 in what way
creations-chat 2019-05-06 17:54:12 because it is yours?
creations-chat 2019-05-06 17:55:25 no he is talking about his 'torpedoes'
creations-chat 2019-05-06 17:55:59 so your boat just disassembles itself?
creations-chat 2019-05-06 17:56:14 patrol boat
creations-chat 2019-05-06 17:56:24 it is not supported by the oxford definition

creations-chat 2019-05-06 17:58:58 a patrol boat is someone elses idea
creations-chat 2019-05-06 17:59:10 and its not inventive
creations-chat 2019-05-06 17:59:52 the concept of making a turret with all the weapons is not inventive
creations-chat 2019-05-06 18:00:11 or making the boat turn into pieces
creations-chat 2019-05-06 18:00:20 i can make my own platform too
creations-chat 2019-05-06 18:00:38 but it wont be original as someone else made a platform before
creations-chat 2019-05-06 18:01:28 just because you havent seen something doesnt mean it has not been done before
creations-chat 2019-05-06 18:01:44 you have not seen the moon landing
creations-chat 2019-05-06 18:01:49 but it has been done
creations-chat 2019-05-06 18:02:17 show us that your blue stick is original
creations-chat 2019-05-06 18:02:18 lol
creations-chat 2019-05-06 18:02:31 no not everything is the same

Darrel Cartrip: Bob, my oil pressure's through the roof right now. If this gets more exciting, they're gonna have to tow me outta the booth!
Bob Cutlass: Right you are, Darrell. Three cars are tied for the season points lead, heading into the final race of the season. And the winner of this race Darrell, will win the season title and, the Piston Cup. Does The King, Strip Weathers, have one more victory in him before retirement?
Darrell: He's been Dinoco's golden boy for years! Can he win them one last Piston Cup? 
Bob: And, as always, in the second place spot we find Chick Hicks. He's been chasing that tailfin his entire career.
Darrell: Chick thought this was his year, Bob. His chance to finally emerge from The King's shadow. But the last thing he expected was...Lightning McQueen!
Bob: You know, I don't think anybody expected this. The rookie sensation come into the season unknown. But everyone knows him now.
Darrell: Will he be the first rookie to win a Piston Cup and land Dinoco?
Bob: The legend, the runner up, and the rookie! Three cars, one champion!
