gameplay
make players / player model weightless so that we can walk freely on lets say a flying platform without having someone correcting the angle.   i have a giant base that flies,but if i walk anywhere on it,it tilts off course. i have to use helium but then people will say that its only the helium making it fly. would also make it possible for stuff like passenger planes with lots of people because the people wouldnt affect the plane.  idk it just depends on if you like being weightless.   what i mean by this is like,you just dont affect builds. not gravity or anything.      have a good day
