help 2021-04-27 19:28:27 my helicopter can barely turn even though I’ve put in a rear rotor, and I don’t know how to make my helicopter hover still, it also keeps rolling backwards even tho I’ve put density infront
help 2021-04-27 19:48:54 alright I’ve fixed rolling back and turning but I dont know how to hover still
help 2021-04-28 00:06:12 wdym
help 2021-04-28 00:06:21 well the plane has the mass thing in the center
help 2021-04-28 00:06:30 so it’s balanced
help 2021-04-28 00:06:37 but the blue one is a bit back
help 2021-04-28 00:07:15 so if I use “apply at center”
help 2021-04-28 00:07:19 it doesn’t apply at center?
help 2021-04-28 00:07:49 for the ballast block
help 2021-04-28 00:07:51 yeah
help 2021-04-28 00:07:57 idk
help 2021-04-28 00:07:58 uh
help 2021-04-28 00:08:35 if the gravity thing is a bit back, do I add weight to the front?
help 2021-04-28 00:08:41 the blue ball thingy
help 2021-04-28 00:09:22 is that why mine does backflips?
help 2021-04-28 00:09:28 uh oh
help 2021-04-28 00:09:33 how do I fix it?
help 2021-04-28 00:09:43 i don’t think adding wings to the front would look good
help 2021-04-28 00:10:05 alright
help 2021-04-28 00:11:39 and how do I make the heli hover automatically?
help 2021-04-28 00:11:57 like instead of just going forward constantly when rotors are moving
help 2021-04-28 00:13:20 wa
help 2021-04-28 00:13:37 are you ingame right now?
help 2021-04-28 00:13:41 i don’t understand that image
help 2021-04-28 00:13:45 rip
help 2021-04-28 00:14:50 Do I add the wing panels to the front?
help 2021-04-28 00:21:39 well now my helis two rotors are spinning together even tho they’re separate speeds & directions
help 2021-04-28 00:25:51 anyone know what’s wrong with this?
help 2021-04-28 00:37:21 fixed the rotors, but now it barely turns & keeps going up
help 2021-04-28 00:37:28 im trying to make it hover automatically
help 2021-04-28 00:38:11 to where tho
help 2021-04-28 00:40:48 well now it doesn’t move
help 2021-04-28 00:42:21 still too heavy
help 2021-04-28 16:50:43 How do you make your helicopter hover instead of going up?
help 2021-04-28 16:51:20 then you use propellers to go up/down?
help 2021-04-28 16:51:41 is there other ways?
help 2021-04-28 16:51:52 because I dont know how to go forward without just going up because of the rotors
help 2021-04-28 16:52:55 yeah but I’m trying to keep it realistic, so I don’t wanna just go straight
help 2021-04-28 16:53:05 im trying to make it tilt when it goes forward without going up
