creations-chat 2021-06-29 15:50:15 remember lads: nowadays its more quantity not quality in the creations channel
(yup)
(i mean i cant say much anyways, my latest vehicle took like 2 hours, yet got decent upvotes)
(prob down to the fact, even i dont motorlock, i can make my builds semi-decent looking)
creations-chat 2021-06-29 15:59:35 w h o ' s  b u i l d ?
creations-chat 2021-06-29 16:03:42 mate, i had permission form him: he's my fucking friend.
and by modifying, i literally mean i fucking reconstructed the entire thing, it isnt even the same length anymore, new suspension system, completely new design, went from AWD to FWD ffs
creations-chat 2021-06-29 16:12:17 Actually no that brings up the question: why do i get upvotes when my builds are shite:
(and yes i edited this theyre like 2 months apart)
creations-chat 2021-06-29 16:14:58 mate lemme just summarise whats new on the chassis: new wheelbase, extended chassis by 2 blocks to account for stability, converted the drivetrain to FWD, gave it fucking differential, lowered weight by removing around 20 unnecessary parts from the AWD drivetrain
creations-chat 2021-06-29 16:23:31 realistically mines more "simple" but his one is effectively unusable for making car bodies on, and lags ALOT more due to the excessive amounts of inactive motors
(i essentially built mine to be actually used on vehicles, whilst his can only hold a small cockpit with a few blocks around it, and a decorated engine bay

creations-chat 2021-06-29 16:27:47 ***exactly***
yeah i just dont see why i actually get half decent upvotes compared to say, pouyuto's IS7: i literally got nearly half of that builds upvotes, for a build that took around 2-3 hrs to figure out, compared to a build that prob took 2-3 weeks to make
creations-chat 2021-07-03 15:14:59 unless they did this:

literally the worst vehicle i ever made, but i was proud of it, at the time
Kharkovchanka
really bad remake of it
creations-chat 2021-09-03 08:52:31 heres the remake of it im making (well, im just finishing off a build ive had for 7 months, but never bothered to make it accurate)
still got a crapton of work to do on it, however.
creations-chat 2021-09-03 08:55:10 i know its still a piece of shit, but im satisfied with it, Imao

(back in march this year, so pretty old build of mine)
creations-chat 2021-09-08 16:33:10 thanks, its a custom livery i made, just cus i didnt want to use the original Kharkovchanka livery at the time

creations-chat 2021-09-27 17:57:08 opinions on my new concept J9-3 "Haast" Interceptor?
(basically took my J7W1 Shinden and started evolving it. this is the 3rd evolution of the original J7 i have.)
<@!715148402022678608> nope, i did not, Imao - they do use J7 Shindens, but this is essentially the J7 but on overdrive
creations-chat 2021-09-27 18:01:29 thanks for the reccomendation, just suprised how well it turned out. heres a photo of the og J7 i have had for about a month (its my 2nd plane ive ever officially built)
creations-chat 2021-09-27 18:04:16 thats cus the TPTP uses the J7 Shinden, but slightly modernised, like this
<@!715148402022678608> oh crap i almost forgot, i had the 2nd evolution of it aswell
creations-chat 2021-09-27 18:07:07 tried to give it a more naval look on this scheme, to the point i once gave it folding wings..if you see the placement of the gear, i think you can guess how that turned out
creations-chat 2021-09-27 18:10:53 yeah, the main idea for Evo 2 was to smooth out the parts on the rear and give it a more cleaner appearance, alongside a engine boost system, more guns, and a partially reworked flight system
creations-chat 2021-09-27 18:13:58 yeah, the design just looks very vulpen-esque, but very nice build nonetheless
afk, got to do some stuff.
<@!823746304348782613> it just looks like something the mad vulpen wouldve made, but with more detail. were not saying its a tut, just looks like something a tutorial creator wouldve done
creations-chat 2021-09-28 16:24:31 the plane layout itself or the bodywork?
if the layout, thats just a pusher plane layout for props (engine at the back doing reverse thrust)
if its the bodywork, i dont angle lock.

creations-chat 2021-10-09 17:21:42 i dont want to use half blocks or actual wings, cus they have both got tradeoffs

creations-chat 2021-10-13 17:24:05 hmm, thoughts on my kitbashed Savoia S.21 (fictional plane from the Studio Ghibli film "Porco Rosso" 
I only built this cus the engine i made looked good, the bodydoesnt suit it
creations-chat 2021-10-13 17:38:41 yeah, as i said, kitbashed. i didnt intend on this being a fully accurate remake, just wanted to test my floatplane skills (its my 1st attempt in general.)
creations-chat 2021-10-13 17:43:34 right imma go make a schneider trophy boi with the engine now.
creations-chat 2021-10-13 17:51:08 fixed the paint scheme, but imma start working on the front now
creations-chat 2021-10-13 17:55:04 yeah, im intending on adding a bunch of stuff for it, whilst also making the Piccolo S.P.A hangar
also going to redo the engine bay. cus its too detailed

thanks for the feedback, really helped alot

creations-chat 2021-10-16 11:50:02 thoughts on the Savoia S.21 ive been working on? (older photo, updated it today.) im open for feedback, i just really need ideas for the continuation of it.
yes i know theres no angle locking on the body, nor the wings, i just dont want to spend the next 2 years trying to hide the locks.
creations-chat 2021-10-16 12:00:47 thats the point, the Savoia S21 is a fictional plane from Porco Rosso, its intentionally bright

creations-chat 2021-10-16 19:35:26 it looks worse, ill admit - maybe do some angle locking?
creations-chat 2021-10-16 19:38:20 fair enough. just remember once youve gotten better at angle locking, to try again. best of luck

this is his, unfinished, and looks "somewhat" similiar
explain that then.
creations-chat 2022-04-07 01:08:53 explain why its in another plot and showing the camera's on the side then :wheeze:
creations-chat 2022-04-07 01:13:03 freak coincidence.
1) those arent default colours, you can tell (only red ingame is 255,0,0, and the 3 greens are too bright to be the same)
2) they literally have identical front cockpit glass, alongside alot of other identical details
1) common plane type, sure, but doesnt mean everyone mass produces the *exact* same model (save the vulpen B17)

anyways im getting bored of this
creations-chat 2022-04-07 01:17:03 right i need ideas on what to actually make in plane crazy, i've pretty much reset my save data, so i need some more stuff to fill out the vacuum
*im not making a jet.*
creations-chat 2022-04-07 01:19:34 sure looks default to me.
im tired of this petty shit.

so i can point out stuff, i delete em later cus i have no reason to keep something like that.
creations-chat 2022-04-07 01:21:45 does that make it default? no, it doesnt.
creations-chat 2022-04-07 01:28:30 we kinda were talking bout that, goose. might wanna look back a little bit.

i mean, just look at creations right now.
creations-chat 2022-04-08 21:46:00 so? the community will still accept non locked builds, it doesnt immediately downvote a build that isnt locked to all hell Imo
creations-chat 2022-04-08 21:52:25 right ive got a question:
why tf did this ass build of mine get a positive upvote ratio?

<@887517130248056903> custom design "LF-5 Comorant" based on designs from elite dangerous
creations-chat 2022-04-08 21:55:38 repetitive af to look at, doesnt really have anything that stands out, also the detail itself is of incredibly low quality (especially the cannons). colour scheme is pretty boring aswell, everything is the same tone of grey.
also, *how many emojis?*

right, sure, because i've played with you on plane crazy before, i know for a fact your designs are more for functionality over looks. but still, most of the time, the community prefers looks over function.
creations-chat 2022-04-08 21:58:12 we arent getting mad, we're just criticising your creation, is that not allowed anymore? (well, i am anyways.)

<@357550075507113994> decent design, but as rodaxty said, needs more details. also is that colourscheme ww1 inspired?
creations-chat 2022-04-08 22:00:31 okay i am gonna point out something a bit bullshit for me:
**how in gods name did this get positive upvotes (21 up - 8 down)**
***where ya'll on something when you judged my 2nd creation i ever posted?***
didnt upload ffs <:pain:644301805534183464>

creations-chat 2022-04-08 22:03:53 okay i am gonna point out something a bit bullshit for me:

i could point out so much thats shit with this, im genuinly astonished how this got more uvpotes than down
creations-chat 2022-04-08 22:05:36 like, what the fck is that rudder shape, what is the camo pattern :Wheeze:
<@887517130248056903> better than my first design, i genuinely thought that diamond plate = more armour when i first made a boat
creations-chat 2022-04-08 22:07:47 nah im just questioning why the server thought it was good Imao

creations-chat 2022-07-23 19:53:46 i need ideas on how to paint this, the previous and current paint scheme look shit
(also isn't finished)

ik, it just looks bland
creations-chat 2022-07-23 19:56:51 I mean, the paintscheme with dark green would still look a bit bland, but i suppose a dark blue-ish grey (abit like that of the russian naval vessels, or the german panzer force's metal) would look good

textures i tend to not use, mainly because it rarely works well on how i do my builds
creations-chat 2022-07-28 18:19:58 time to wait 10 rotations of the milky way before mod respond <:trollface:775024642104229898>

Like, it isnt even a minor decrease in quality, its just become the living personification of shit
creations-chat 2022-09-11 12:42:18 true, tbh
okay why tf do i have 100 upvotes on a placeholder creations post of a build from early 2021 to tell people to piss off with queen memorials?
creations-chat 2022-09-11 12:46:44 i might just post some of my builds tbh, i havent posted any new ones in 6 months
creations-chat 2022-09-11 13:19:19 did it, preparing thyself for the pointing out of all the crap on my build, seeming i know it isnt that good :wheeze:
creations-chat 2022-09-11 13:22:46 thats the point Imao, most of the whitename plebs dont ever take in criticism, so they always end up producing hot garbage, and staying that way

nah, needs to be personal, i need to certify that i aswell think it is shit
creations-chat 2022-09-11 13:27:27 constructive criticism doesnt exist anymore on this server, its either trash talk, or shitposts when it comes to criticism

creations-chat 2022-09-12 18:46:35 i'd say any actual post-image edits to the build itself shouldn't be allowed (ie afterburner effects, custom decals that arent possible in PC) , but stuff like generalised editing to the whole image (e.g greyscale, period-style camera quality) would be fine.
shaders are okay aswell, but theyre sorta like autotune 
just a whitename's opinion, tis all.
creations-chat 2022-09-12 18:49:23 yeah, theyre fine, its just they do substantially boost upvotes, cus of "hurr durr better image"
though sometimes it does result in such things as that goof-ass fiat or whatever it was
creations-chat 2022-09-12 18:53:52 yup, thats the one

(Usually retrofitted oil tankers)
creations-chat 2022-11-20 20:01:33 Best thing is, they still function as cargo ships, whilst being able to operate ASW aircraft
creations-chat 2022-11-20 20:06:56 Completely different, they arent purpose built, often retrofitted from a ACTUAL merchant ship, and arent buikt by the US.
They also maintain merchant cargo capacity, so also have that extra benefit. 
Though they serve a similar purpose, the merchant carrier (or MAC) were built as replacements for the escort carriers, as the US couldnt sustain the rates at which u boats torped said escort carriers.

creations-chat 2022-11-26 15:39:02 man wouldnt it be amazing if people just took criticism and didnt rose-tint their view of their own builds, instead of whinging about how they didnt get showers of praise, and how a build that genuinely looked better despite its lack in """complexity""" got more upvotes
you wrote a essay which began with, and i quote "how the fuck does this get upvotes and mine doesnt". how is that not complaining
both looked shit, but his one didnt look like it had fucking smallpox
creations-chat 2022-11-26 15:42:22 it isnt the fact its a essay, its the fact you literally whined about how 1 build did better than your build, only defending how your build looked like a fucking plague victim because of """functionality"""

help 2022-12-22 12:43:20 dumbass thing i need help with for when i begin remaking this old build of mine:
*what colour should i paint it in?* 
white just seems way too bland, but i dont want to use anything too flashy, like red/blue/etc, but i also dont want to use a more generic scheme, like green/yellow. any ideas?
creations-chat 2022-12-22 13:31:52 maybe a sorta pendulum system could work, as to shift the weight
only issue is that'd take alot of space up, and would be fairly complicated
creations-chat 2022-12-22 16:28:20 wait, do you have any photos of your Savoia S21 (Porco's Plane)?
how did i not notice that-
creations-chat 2022-12-22 16:30:25 i made one ages ago, but personally im not proud of it at all, comically oversized and way too wide, also lacked alot of details.

help 2022-12-24 17:49:21 1) dont take other peoples shit, masquerade around acting as if its yours, then when you're busted, say it was a "joke"
2) *actual* advice: learn to build through practical knowledge, in this case, making your own shit. sure, it'll take time, and alot of trial and error, but you learn your actual limits, and building style, instead of just copying notes from someone who's already done it. also, dont judge your builds against other players builds, especially those who have had much longer to get actually good at what they make - it'll just end up with you being jealous, salty, and a downright annoying prick.

creations-chat 2023-01-24 21:16:05 How to get Pixel artist role Step-by-step tutorial
1) find high quality image of what you want to do
2) open photo editing software, pixelate until it fits the size of the pc plot or lower (50 pixels across maximum) 
3) copy each individual pixel
4) profit <:trollface:775024642104229898>

Hidden 5th step) use script <:empty:794431705070174238>
creations-chat 2023-01-24 21:19:16 I mean thats about, 2500 individual pixels for a full 50x50 canvas
So taking into consideration the fact you have to colour pick each pixel, thats about 10-20 seconds

You're actually consistent though, you don't just post once every interglacial period lo
creations-chat 2023-01-30 22:38:09 Meanwhile im just here noticing that i haven't actually improved in building skills for over 2 years <:empty:794431705070174238>
creations-chat 2023-01-30 22:40:47 Mfw been playing since mid 2020, still havent used angle lock once in any build

I mean thats more a blessing and a curse, you'll build shit fast, but you'll also get burnout fast aswell
creations-chat 2023-01-30 22:43:16 I myself have been in a state of perpetual burnout and dissatisfaction/disappointment with my stuff since april 2021, so thats fun for me

creations-chat 2023-01-30 22:46:35 Anyone got any tips for a longtime player who doesnt enjoy PC anymore due to their inability to make any decent shit theyre satisfied with?
Asking for a friend here<:empty:794431705070174238>

Ive been to IWM Duxford multiple times, sure its helped once or twice, but not longtime
creations-chat 2023-01-30 22:49:22 I took a year break, even that wasnt enough
I came back, realised i was still not going to improve, and was back to square zero again
creations-chat 2023-01-30 22:51:43 You can't tell me that this shit is good for someone who's been playing for close to 3 years now, with over 87 days of playtime

Be honest lmao
creations-chat 2023-01-30 22:55:18 You took what, under a day to get all the shit done for your ME-262, Right?

That took about 20+ days of editing to do for me, it shouldn't even take 4 hours
(Editing as in making it look "average")
creations-chat 2023-01-30 22:57:44 Its not even a fucking original design, half of it is just a fucking carbon copy of my M1A4 Juggernaut

Yeah, i do that aswell
Half my fucking ideas fail spectacularly

Yeah, and both even unfinished make my shit look like something someone cooked up on their 3rd day of playtime

creations-chat 2023-02-02 20:07:54 true, but i think ik a diff way, that i learnt from a knockoff lego brands version of the Strv 103
