creations-chat 2020-09-26 06:08:41 yes
creations-chat 2020-09-26 06:11:52 Ok, teslas use smart air suspension so, although it will take up quite a bit of space, piston with a sideways 1x3with two motor 1s unpowered on reset holding a powered motor 1
creations-chat 2020-09-26 06:12:20 LOL
creations-chat 2020-09-26 06:12:55 Yes but

creations-chat 2020-09-26 06:15:42 hmm
creations-chat 2020-09-26 06:16:34 ill make it so the suspension travel is limited
creations-chat 2020-09-26 06:17:20 and i will connect a spring to the chassis off the powered motor 1 to make it more rigid
creations-chat 2020-09-26 06:17:36 Teslas dont have drive shafts

creations-chat 2020-10-30 23:04:36 What do you guys think of my Concorde, I spent 4 hours getting it to fly perfectly and have a working Droop Snoot.
creations-chat 2020-10-30 23:06:01 It took me 3 days to build the plane itself, I went through 4 versions before I got the current wings and fuselage.
creations-chat 2020-10-30 23:07:05 i spent an hour shortening it to be able to make the nose longer...
creations-chat 2020-10-30 23:08:41 It's the best I could do to get every motor into the nose and stll have everything function
creations-chat 2020-10-30 23:10:09 In that nose, there is 2 motors, a piston and that is motorlocked by two locked motors which go into the nose so I didn't really have any space for anything, I went through 13 versions of windshield for the droopsnoot.

It had the USSR hammer and sickle because it was captured by the Russians. It now sits in the Kubinka Tank Museum near Moscow.

creations-chat 2020-11-15 16:48:16 I got blacklisted because of some dumbass spammer. The type that ignores complaints in creations chat. I posted an image that said 'shut up dumbass' and got blacklisted. Also, Retre, your only rank is aeronaut III and Symbion is a sad little verified.
creations-chat 2020-11-15 16:51:25 First off, I can't be bothered to read your name. I'm fucking tired and depressed. Plus, it's a joke that has literally been around in PCC for a while. Unranked means you either can't be bothered to attempt to build something good or just can't be bothered to build at all.
creations-chat 2020-11-15 16:53:03 Applying for a rank literally takes 30 seconds.

creations-chat 2021-02-17 11:16:14 <@456226577798135808> why did you downvote?

so spam downvoting?
creations-chat 2021-02-17 11:19:33 robo, is 'te <:sus:805543105428193301> ' a valid reason to downvote?
creations-chat 2021-02-17 11:29:53 first person, so you can see through the nose for better visibility

yeah how about telling me why instead of just saying 2 words
creations-chat 2021-02-17 11:34:59 are you telling me you want the plane to be common?
creations-chat 2021-02-17 11:38:42 not like your builds are too good either

'It's bad' isn't criticism though is it
creations-chat 2021-02-17 11:40:43 I said, 'It's bad' isn't criticism, is it.
creations-chat 2021-02-17 11:43:17 Go ahead. I'll wait. I'm not bothered if they're 'simple minded' I want constructive criticism, not just you being a bag of shit, trying to piss me off.
creations-chat 2021-02-17 11:46:17 Ok, thanks for some actual criticism.
creations-chat 2021-02-17 11:57:07 That was about my A-10, where the sides are flat like the real thing. If you seriously need to bring up previous arguments then you can't construct something based on the current argument. Not everyone here attempts *constructive* criticism. A few people have responded with 'It's bad' just like you did. The A-10 which you just brought up and where I commented about the 130000 motor locks needed to do something with the side of the fuselage was unneeded on my end, but you bringing it up again is just restarting unneeded drama that wasn't called for.
creations-chat 2021-02-17 12:08:49 you still think 'It's bad' is constructive and that's pretty cringe. You literally said it before and that's the reason this argument started <:LULW:719972409947717727>

Does it look like I give a single fuck in hell how long my sentence is? This is an argument, not a dong measuring contest
creations-chat 2021-02-17 12:11:10 yeah, i found this pretty entertaining <:PepeLaugh:697130830081818634>
creations-chat 2021-02-17 12:15:40 it's not an overuse, it all has a function. Also, the A-10's fuselage did in fact have flat sides! If you need a reference, just check every single fucking image of an A-10 on earth. I used references, I build to the best of my ability. Also, the 'It's bad' was the reason this argument started. I apologise that I didn't see your statement of an apparent 'overuse of motorlock'. Downvoting a build because it has a lot of motorlocks doesn't seem very logical to me.
creations-chat 2021-02-17 12:25:48 The plane is actually very light and the center of balance is perfect, It only uses 6 super rockets to propel it forwards to a speed of 533sps. Also, I didn't plan on changing the fuselage. I angled it etc.
creations-chat 2021-02-17 12:29:47 Ok, I thought I saw someone say something about the sides of the A-10, I apologise and I don't go back to look through arguments often because I'm frankly not bothered. I deleted the A-10 because I, too, thought it was a massive bag of shit which is why I spoke about bringing up past arguments.
creations-chat 2021-02-17 12:32:16 woah, is that temp's mom?

creations-chat 2021-05-04 21:16:06 <@!492815944666578975> imo you should custom angle the hull and try and find a smaller alternative to the barrels on the turrets

Skillet, you literally brag about your ‘skill’ to newcomers once they post a build that you’ve already done, sometimes, their build is LITERALLY better than yours. I do not think you have the authority to call people out on what’s ‘low effort’ or what isn’t. You seem to have high standards that you can’t even seem to meet yourself. And yet, the audacity you have to call someone out and try to get them banned because of some builds they posted? Fucking astonishing.

creations-chat 2021-07-22 19:31:29 im just gonna say that the canopy is different to how it actually looks, theres a half wedge there, not 2 full blocks on the angled part, if i did trails the motor wouldve been exposed

the one thing i was hoping not to get on the build was exposed motors and i somehow subconciously managed to essentially achive that

the only motors i couldnt hide were on the wings but thats obviously something thats there for functionality and can be easily removed

creations-chat 2021-11-26 00:10:55 yes, they often had animals on the vertical stabiliser

i added a buffalo because theyre pretty hefty, and the 2 horns could represent the 2 guided missiles at the front of the plane which i will soon add along with the fuselage fins
creations-chat 2021-11-26 00:31:08 yeah i know, didnt have much time though so i had to improvise

<@!698587744842022983> not on my PC right now but im going off documents which state the wing angle is 60°, and im using delta wing 1x2s which are 60°
creations-chat 2021-11-26 00:34:40 no, blueprints are unreliable due to perspective and direct angle
creations-chat 2021-11-26 00:36:41 yeah i know about the mini angle thing, but i had like 30 minutes to do the wings and because of a certain area of motorlock it will be a fuck to make the wings look good
creations-chat 2021-11-26 07:17:09 well exactly, there is a smaller angled piece and the cockpit does merge, however i can make the merge less sadge like i planned

creations-chat 2022-02-24 22:15:45 well i don't think that's happening considering it's:

my first build in 4 months

a first design, i barely make rotors

most likely impossible to hide the motors due to a lack of space and effort because im a lazy shit
creations-chat 2022-02-24 22:21:12 made a new prototype

creations-chat 2022-02-24 23:27:51 done soon
creations-chat 2022-02-25 00:12:35 thats the design i was going for, so no thanks
creations-chat 2022-02-25 00:27:10 ?
creations-chat 2022-02-25 00:31:55 
creations-chat 2022-02-25 00:36:01 theres some cool engineering, for example the rear prop and horizontal/vertical stabilizer moves when you switch modes
creations-chat 2022-02-25 00:38:17 exactly, it's meant to be very sci-fi. The paint scheme is mildly resemblant of russian military aviation. 70s and 80s USSR projects were very outlandish, which is what I was hoping to achieve. I was trying to make something strange with could've been a USSR design concept that was never fully endorsed, such as the MiL V-12.
creations-chat 2022-02-25 00:40:30 lmao, but tell me this doesnt look like some shitbarge the russians woulda made
