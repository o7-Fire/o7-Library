creations-chat 2020-08-12 18:56:41 sights‚Ñ¢Ô∏è
creations-chat 2020-08-12 19:16:51 ive made a couple upgrades to my tank
creations-chat 2020-08-12 19:16:53 1: bag storage
creations-chat 2020-08-12 19:16:59 2: smoke on the gun and an actual barrel thing
creations-chat 2020-08-12 19:17:15 3: the turret machine gun has a camera, scope, and you can lock the turning on it for ease of access in first person mode
creations-chat 2020-08-12 19:17:43 yeah but the main issue is that i dont have the right parts
creations-chat 2020-08-12 19:17:46 and im not very good at motor locking
creations-chat 2020-08-12 19:18:00 improvements can definitely be made
creations-chat 2020-08-12 19:18:15 i would have to completely remove the current turret
creations-chat 2020-08-12 19:18:21 and replace it with different layers for components
creations-chat 2020-08-12 19:18:24 that all collapse together when done
creations-chat 2020-08-12 19:21:28 the biggest thing i can upgrade on this tank is the track
creations-chat 2020-08-12 19:21:36 instead of making fake conveyor tracks i could add real suspension
creations-chat 2020-08-12 19:21:42 but the problem with that is its H A R D
creations-chat 2020-08-12 22:18:53 how do i do T-90 style armor plating on this bad boi
creations-chat 2020-08-12 22:34:22 now

creations-chat 2020-08-13 01:35:31 the sword has a special ability
creations-chat 2020-08-13 01:35:49 whenever it strikes something it attacks pretty much everything in a large radius around me
creations-chat 2020-08-13 01:35:54 due to it spazzing out

creations-chat 2020-08-14 16:24:56 this is gonna be FUCKED
creations-chat 2020-08-14 16:26:39 ITS A BIT HARD TO CONTROL
creations-chat 2020-08-14 16:27:33 
creations-chat 2020-08-14 16:27:59 its like a trailer but every part of it is powered
creations-chat 2020-08-14 16:29:26 and you steer the trailer instead of steering the car
creations-chat 2020-08-14 16:30:09 now to just give it tracks
creations-chat 2020-08-14 16:30:13 i have no clue how
creations-chat 2020-08-14 16:30:51 i wonder if i can do this for every wheel
creations-chat 2020-08-14 21:23:06 hows this for the front of a heli
creations-chat 2020-08-14 21:23:17 
creations-chat 2020-08-14 21:45:03 door
creations-chat 2020-08-14 21:45:09 
creations-chat 2020-08-14 21:45:30 now how do i make a propeller for a heli
creations-chat 2020-08-14 21:55:20 it flies
creations-chat 2020-08-14 21:55:22 but theres too much torque
creations-chat 2020-08-14 21:55:25 and it goes crazy
creations-chat 2020-08-14 21:56:15 how do i make the helicopter not spin out of control
creations-chat 2020-08-14 21:56:19 due to torque
creations-chat 2020-08-14 21:57:56 I FIXED THE SPINNING SOMEHOW
creations-chat 2020-08-14 21:57:59 I JUST ADDED MORE MOTORS
creations-chat 2020-08-14 22:08:54 what are the heaviest blocks
creations-chat 2020-08-14 22:09:03 ballast blocks dont change the weight
creations-chat 2020-08-14 22:09:07 only buoyancy
creations-chat 2020-08-14 22:13:47 *this is the greatest pLAAAAAAAAN*
creations-chat 2020-08-14 22:14:24 do i give my heli a sword
creations-chat 2020-08-14 22:14:26 or my future heli
creations-chat 2020-08-14 22:14:30 idk what to do with it
creations-chat 2020-08-14 22:14:34 it doesnt have a tail
creations-chat 2020-08-14 22:14:40 its flying Ka-52 style
creations-chat 2020-08-14 22:33:32 ffs
creations-chat 2020-08-14 22:33:36 the center of mass is too far forward
creations-chat 2020-08-14 22:33:40 and im out of weight to weigh
creations-chat 2020-08-14 22:33:47 the ballast tanks dont work very well
creations-chat 2020-08-14 22:34:12 <@!697786877444358186> you mean unverified?
creations-chat 2020-08-14 22:34:36 because that kinda makes it so that no new people can ever post in creations
creations-chat 2020-08-14 22:34:43 if its only unranked
creations-chat 2020-08-14 22:34:48 when you get ranks exclusively in creations
creations-chat 2020-08-14 22:37:12 ah
creations-chat 2020-08-14 22:59:49 some shredder bugs are cool if they aren't designed to just wipe servers (mostly die trying)
creations-chat 2020-08-14 23:00:19 ive seen a shredder bug style build (same mechanic) that was literally a fucking shark with moving jaw
creations-chat 2020-08-14 23:00:38 im stealing that idea
creations-chat 2020-08-14 23:42:49 no helium no motorlock shitty heli
creations-chat 2020-08-14 23:43:04 the only damn reason this thing can fly is that im a slightly better than average pilot
creations-chat 2020-08-15 01:05:02 hmmm
creations-chat 2020-08-15 01:05:23 build sword heli
creations-chat 2020-08-15 01:06:31 <@!492887853702053898> wait i got a cool idea
creations-chat 2020-08-15 01:06:47 autogyro
creations-chat 2020-08-15 01:06:57 basically just imagine a plane helicopter
creations-chat 2020-08-15 01:07:19 basically
creations-chat 2020-08-15 01:07:28 the problem is
creations-chat 2020-08-15 01:07:37 if you push down on the stick the rotor on the top will lose energy and stop
creations-chat 2020-08-15 01:07:48 which basically means doing the one thing you should always do in a stall makes you stall out even faster
creations-chat 2020-08-15 01:08:00 but they do automatically recover if you dont do anything
creations-chat 2020-08-15 18:20:03 this is the greatest plaaaaaan
creations-chat 2020-08-15 18:54:10 imma make a DoG shredder bug

creations-chat 2020-08-15 23:10:01 since i cant make it go around
creations-chat 2020-08-15 23:10:16 it would require me to redo a pretty damn complex mechanism
creations-chat 2020-08-15 23:20:47 <@!200793484053970944> its a shredder bug without the shredder
creations-chat 2020-08-15 23:21:18 idk how to make it longer
creations-chat 2020-08-15 23:21:20 i want to
creations-chat 2020-08-15 23:21:27 im aiming for 10 segments
creations-chat 2020-08-15 23:21:33 i think its a bit too C H O N K Y tho
creations-chat 2020-08-15 23:26:59 i wish i could just copy segments
creations-chat 2020-08-15 23:27:01 but no
creations-chat 2020-08-15 23:41:00 this is gonna require some motorlock
creations-chat 2020-08-15 23:41:07 
creations-chat 2020-08-15 23:46:07 <:Menacing:644323168819085312>

creations-chat 2020-08-15 23:54:40 yeah ik but the thing is
creations-chat 2020-08-15 23:54:55 it'd get screwy if its too dark
creations-chat 2020-08-15 23:55:02 due to roblox's lighting system being kinda h
creations-chat 2020-08-15 23:55:27 also for some reason changing the color also changed the weight?
creations-chat 2020-08-15 23:55:39 no clue what happened there but im probably gonna shove some helium blocks set to "apply to center"
creations-chat 2020-08-15 23:57:15 that did nothing
creations-chat 2020-08-15 23:57:23 yeah
creations-chat 2020-08-15 23:57:26 now it cant fly
creations-chat 2020-08-15 23:57:33 even with 16 helium blocks
creations-chat 2020-08-15 23:57:57 no
creations-chat 2020-08-15 23:58:09 it just cant pull up now

creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:11:00 you know
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:11:03 making swords is getting old
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:11:10 but im not out of ideas
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:11:14 a whip is just a bendy sword right?
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:16:31 <@!419477639229865984> you have NO FUCKING IDEA
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:17:12 i have a plan.
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:17:50 1: take my abruhms chassis
2: add a very long whip to it
3: add a heavy weight to the end of it with a thruster to kickstart
4: explosives in the middle
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:17:59 so i can wrap the whip around somebody's build
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:18:06 and either yank it, explode it, or throw it
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:18:27 either that or use the physics engine (or lack thereof) to just send them to the 5th dimension
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:18:48 i'll break the game in a thousand different ways
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:18:55 and find a way to weaponize every single one of them
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:19:54 im the fucking Elon Musk of bad ideas
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:22:31 how do you wear a skin tight mech control suit or whatever for hours
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:22:58 generic Mecha girls
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:23:18 d.va and that one girl who tried to sing September i forgot
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:24:45 im talking about the clothing
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:24:53 that shits gotta get sweaty right?
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:25:00 or is it future tech bullshit
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:26:37 oh
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:26:52 that‚Äôs kinda errr
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:27:11 breathable liquid is a bit of a mess since it needs to aerosolize so we can process it
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:27:20 but the problem is
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:27:24 liquid dense
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:27:26 gas isn‚Äôt
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:27:35 that shit gonna expand
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:27:50 and the cockpit is gonna get a nice new red paint job
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:28:20 ok
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:28:32 you‚Äôre going into the horny cube before you proceed any further
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:28:36 begone
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:29:14 i overanalyze things before you ask
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:29:37 since our lungs can‚Äôt process liquid
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:29:53 no matter how you slice it
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:30:24 ah
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:30:33 so they literally consume magic life juice
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:30:38 ok that makes sense
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:30:46 it‚Äôs just a catch-all clause
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:31:19 sufficiently advanced technology is basically just magic
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:32:03 but
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:32:16 wouldn‚Äôt Lilith be either in the mantle or on the moon
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:32:24 due to a planetary fucking collision
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:33:43 angles
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:34:31 ok im not really concerned about how the juice came to be
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:34:37 i want to know how it works
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:34:48 it‚Äôs hard to know this without watching evangelion
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:34:59 no wonder Fanta is so fucking good
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:35:04 it‚Äôs life juice
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:35:23 wait a second didn‚Äôt the Germans invent Fanta
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:36:30 you mean the weird biblical angels
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:36:43 fear not
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:37:19 it happened anyway and shit hit the fan im assuming
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:38:27 so basically it‚Äôs girls in mech suits breathing the life juice they came from trying to kill cursed (blessed?) onion rings
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:38:51 did i nail it or did i nail it
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:38:57 uhhh
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:38:59 maybe
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:39:23 i don‚Äôt like watching anime in front of my parents they think it‚Äôs weird
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:40:07 ive kinda drifted away from anime in general because there‚Äôs something about it which kinda unsettles me
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:40:16 the perfectness of everything
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:40:57 like sure i still like it
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:40:59 no
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:41:06 im not talking about the character traits
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:41:17 im talking about the characters themselves
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:41:29 the environment (most of the time)
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:42:03 i don‚Äôt like the look of perfectly polished materials and plastic skin
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:42:10 unless that‚Äôs what they‚Äôre going for
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:42:17 there‚Äôs gotta be some sort of noise
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:42:30 even if it‚Äôs just a filter
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:42:56 boi that‚Äôs king crimson
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:43:22 green eyes, forehead face

creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:43:59 neat
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:44:16 wait a second
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:44:28 if they‚Äôre living off of good orange liquid
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:44:35 and Fanta is good orange liquid
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:44:46 and Fanta was invented by WWII Germans
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:44:50 then does this mean
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:45:30 it‚Äôs 10:45 im not in the mood
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:45:43 tomorrow i guess ill watch

creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:49:07 cool
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:49:19 i have no clue what was going on but it looked neat
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:50:00 im assuming it‚Äôs just force field shield

creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:50:47 im assuming this one went batshit insane
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:51:13 ok so basically
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:51:42 this bad boi just kinda tore through this anti technology shield (kinda like an EMP maybe)
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:51:55 and that was either a bad or good thing?
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:52:08 ah
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:52:48 so im assuming whoever it was it was attacking wasn‚Äôt expecting it to be alive and it just kinda went through and slapped the shit out of bad guy?
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:53:08 or is that not even close
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:53:11 look man idk

the expectations are either 5000+ block megabuild/diorama/immensely detailed or get 100 downvotes
creations-chat 2022-09-27 18:53:19 all the ro-scale camera lock/piston lock builds are just destroying anyone who doesn‚Äôt have the time or energy to take an entire month creating a tank

creations-chat 2022-12-07 14:25:41 go buy a blender for 99p you absolute wally
creations-chat 2022-12-07 15:07:57 i specialize in fun, goofy builds that aren‚Äôt necessarily good quality but they don‚Äôt have to be
creations-chat 2022-12-07 15:11:13 from what i notice, it‚Äôs always the 1.5k block ro-scale ultra mega super-locked vietnam/afghanistan era fighter jets that get all the love, tanks gotta be perfectly accurate and the size of half a plot to be good, etc
creations-chat 2022-12-07 15:13:50 you spent so long worrying about if the build is gonna do good in <#384025409945337856> that ye forgot the part where you‚Äôre supposed to have fun

it‚Äôs why i like to see the inexperienced builders make shit directly from their imagination or their favorite game and try their best on it, as long as there was visible effort and knowledge put into the build (not those ‚Äúi spent 3 days on making a 50 block plane plz upvote‚Äù type builds, those are people who refuse to learn)
creations-chat 2022-12-07 15:23:20 although that‚Äôs no excuse to refuse to use motorlock or smth, all the tools are available to you so you might as well use them

fourzees, the issue with your builds is the scale, your proportions are all wrong, F-14 is decent but you need to cover up the motorlock somehow and repaint it
creations-chat 2022-12-07 15:26:10 no not like that, your maus turret is super short when it shouldn‚Äôt be, for example

also tbh i‚Äôm not entirely sure if that F-14 is tutorial or not, i just like giving people the benefit of the doubt
creations-chat 2022-12-07 15:58:29 this is why i hate PCC

people like y‚Äôall go out and find every excuse to shit on people without giving any constructive criticism, and then proceed to complain about new players not learning how to build

tbf most of the super stuck up builders here are like 14 and don‚Äôt know what being polite is
creations-chat 2022-12-07 16:00:35 because the argument isn‚Äôt complete, that was more of a statement or an insult than an argument

the actual argument would be that lots of people here have an elitism problem and it drives away inexperienced players

there‚Äôs a difference between a dogshit low effort build and a relatively shit build that had effort put into it
creations-chat 2022-12-07 16:05:02 the fact you gotta shit on everyone else while actively attempting to dissuade me *and* go for the ‚Äúi played for a long time‚Äù brag only further proves my point of people here being toxic elitists

and i do agree, there are lots of people who are shit at building and just never attempt to improve, they‚Äôre usually as much an asshat as everyone else

i‚Äôm focusing on the people who actually want to try building good
creations-chat 2022-12-07 16:07:10 but if someone comes in here asking how to improve their build and they just insult them, that‚Äôs on them, not the builder

iamstuk has a reasonable point, and when people are driven away by toxic players because they wanted to get better at building, it only makes the issues worse
creations-chat 2022-12-07 16:09:48 i‚Äôm saying people need to chill out and stop being elitist, noobmaster is saying that people don‚Äôt need criticism because their builds are already shit and won‚Äôt get better (they need to improve themselves), iamstuk is somewhere inbetween with their argument of ‚Äúit‚Äôs shit, ask how to improve‚Äù

it‚Äôs a classic <#504436696021204992> argument lol

and it‚Äôs not a ‚Äúi‚Äôm playing 3 sides‚Äù argument because those are dumb, i‚Äôm just restating what‚Äôs already happened/is happening
creations-chat 2022-12-07 16:12:24 i mean you aren‚Äôt too much better, i‚Äôm defending you but you also gotta learn how to actually proportion your builds out properly

part of the process of creation is destruction, remake it from scratch and do it better
creations-chat 2022-12-07 16:16:26 i understand that remaking builds is the best way to make them better but i‚Äôm tired of the kneejerk ‚Äúfuck you and fuck your shitty ass build‚Äù type reactions from people who really should be beyond it

and honestly his F-14 isn‚Äôt even that bad, it‚Äôs above average by regular plane crazy standards, it‚Äôs just that the PCC standards are super high and that so many people have made insane F-14s that the definitions of good and bad have changed
creations-chat 2022-12-07 16:18:29 it‚Äôs better to say ‚Äúit‚Äôs shit, do better‚Äù than it is to say ‚Äúit‚Äôs shit, fuck off‚Äù yeah
creations-chat 2022-12-07 16:20:31 you didn‚Äôt say it and that‚Äôs a good thing, you‚Äôre better than a lot of people i see here

if i wanted to quote you specifically on something you never said, i‚Äôd just string together a poor insult instead of trying to make an actual comment
creations-chat 2022-12-07 16:23:04 tbh my patience is running out on some people too because i try to give someone real criticism and/or advice for future builds/remaking the same build and then they take it as a personal insult

probably some level of bias as well because the type of person that listens to criticism and actually goes through with it usually isn‚Äôt the type of person to need to come here to ask someone for help
creations-chat 2022-12-07 16:26:36 you‚Äôve made the mazda that people actually like, now make a tiny shitty ricer miata
creations-chat 2022-12-07 16:28:38 can you give a 3 wide pop up headlights, might be possible with enough ingenuity

i‚Äôll try when i get home
creations-chat 2022-12-07 16:31:45 trapdoor with a sign with circles on it, 2 motors with texts attached to them in a really weird way possibly, then hide the necessary slope with more trapdoors that don‚Äôt open
creations-chat 2022-12-07 16:33:47 you could also do the same but with a gun part and make a spy car lol
creations-chat 2022-12-07 16:36:11 right now i‚Äôm trying to finish up thanatos, hiding as many different weapons as i can in the little armor plate thingies, it all extends out with pistons or motors

bot-central 2022-12-09 03:22:22 -servers
creations-chat 2022-12-09 05:33:41 it‚Äôs mainly the fact that your planes are so simple and yet proportioned nicely, they feel more real than a lot of the attempts at recreating something
creations-chat 2022-12-09 13:03:26 i need some help

trying to make something that can rotate in every direction freely, idk how to do it
like an entire build on a giant gimbal mount or gyroscope
creations-chat 2022-12-09 13:05:29 counterpoint: motors can't rotate something vastly heavier or more resistive than what they're mounted on, it either spins both sides nearly equally or spins the wrong side entirely
creations-chat 2022-12-09 13:41:50 to be fair i didn't know what that was
creations-chat 2022-12-09 19:50:54 <@651854384258351154> keep the chassis but rebuild most of the exterior using angle lock to make it look smoother

either way, you did a pretty good job on that octane
creations-chat 2022-12-31 06:19:17 how would i make a hover chair that can move around without it spinning out of control

propellers make it spin out of control, i can't keep it stable
creations-chat 2022-12-31 06:21:36 center of mass should be perfectly centered but it doesn‚Äôt behave so
creations-chat 2022-12-31 07:14:48 <:FallWithinMyCalculations:995238399164284988>
creations-chat 2022-12-31 07:19:55 actually i should just attach the chair to thanatos‚Äôs head and make it an invisible link
creations-chat 2022-12-31 08:19:56 and don‚Äôt forget some dude who prefers to be anonymous who‚Äôs doing some crazy shit rn

imagine a PvP build that‚Äôs completely impervious to damage, like rockets, cutters, and bullets passing directly through it
creations-chat 2022-12-31 08:21:59 fortunately, nobody has a fucking clue how to actually make something like that work decently, as far as i know it‚Äôs pretty much just a one-off glitch that‚Äôs really inconsistent
creations-chat 2023-01-10 04:34:50 just make a brick move at mach 20, use blunt bow shock plasma dynamics to completely ignore aerodynamics
creations-chat 2023-01-19 03:06:55 working on artemis and apollo again
creations-chat 2023-01-19 03:14:12 currently working on phase chagne
creations-chat 2023-01-19 14:29:02 and usually angle locking is reserved for details on relatively small builds

i forgot if its possible to do in regular servers due to usually requiring delayed motorlock
creations-chat 2023-01-20 23:37:14 front of the other one is done, i just need to fix up the internals and make the back section
creations-chat 2023-01-20 23:54:50 both deployable weapons work now
creations-chat 2023-01-21 02:12:58 please come back
creations-chat 2023-01-21 03:17:16 thanks, unfortunately people don‚Äôt like it
creations-chat 2023-01-21 03:19:20 well now i need to make ares, should be simpler than thanatos and twins but it will be a lot larger
creations-chat 2023-05-23 21:18:56 1212 isn‚Äôt even that good
creations-chat 2023-05-23 21:26:25 nah average is 500-600, but for regular chess hobbyists 1200 prolly about right
