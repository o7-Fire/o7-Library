bug-reports 2020-10-28 12:40:43 so, i had a build that i was workin on, and i had it saved before i logged off, im sure about that, but when i logged back on, it wasnt there and i wouldnt have saved over it because it was an empty save. I know i cant get it back, but maybe prevent such things in the future.

succesful cobra landing by DrDownHill99
creations-chat 2020-10-29 07:56:26 yes
creations-chat 2020-10-29 07:57:46 with a cobra u do get altitude if the engines are on
creations-chat 2020-10-29 07:59:23 he did go more than 45 degrees, i just started filming too late
creations-chat 2020-10-29 08:00:32 > you also don't normally come for a landing from below the ground
<@!207922337549385728> its supposed to be on a carrier, so u can come from under the flight deck
creations-chat 2020-10-29 08:01:56 > that video you posted was just a short landing
> cobra landing isnt even a thing
<@!447221768520859659> yup, its not a real thing thats used; it was created because of that failed landing vid
creations-chat 2020-10-29 08:02:59 > coming that far from below the flight deck means your jet just emerged from the ocean
<@!207922337549385728> this is plane crazy, not irl lmao and carriers arent short; u dont gain that much altitude on a proper cobra
creations-chat 2020-10-29 08:04:05 it was also done in DCS
creations-chat 2020-10-29 08:05:34 yea plane crazy doesnt have proper inertia physics; it does have inertia to some extent
creations-chat 2020-10-29 08:08:59 cobra is possible but just very hard, and u do gain some alt
bot-central 2020-11-30 08:24:46 what was that for?
