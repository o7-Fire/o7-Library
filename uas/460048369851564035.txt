bot-central 2021-01-02 21:36:40 hey your fault for looking at the whole thing, when it's in pfp form you don't see the butt
help 2021-01-02 23:44:07 can i not select separate bits of my build ? do i have to just delete half of it and remake it
help 2021-01-03 00:31:09 any ideas how to make a wind shield ?
help 2021-01-03 02:34:54 hooooooold the phone
help 2021-01-03 02:35:03 i needed like.. the tiniest window, and i got it
help 2021-01-03 02:35:08 and deleted the build cuz it sucked
help 2021-01-03 02:35:44 it's actually impossible to make a working lowrider in this game
help 2021-01-03 02:35:50 i used those it worked out in the end
help 2021-01-03 02:36:05 if you make a low rider you either make it look good, or functional
help 2021-01-03 02:36:08 can't be both
help 2021-01-03 02:36:17 and either way it's going to suck ass
help 2021-01-03 02:36:37 i tried springs on the wheels and it worked
help 2021-01-03 02:36:43 but i had to shave 2 blocks off the car
help 2021-01-03 02:36:57 before that it would not even bounce up
help 2021-01-03 02:37:14 go for it
help 2021-01-03 02:37:24 some advice, give up while you still can
help 2021-01-03 02:37:34 it's not like other cars, cuz it has to be decently flat and long
help 2021-01-03 02:38:15 the least you could do is 3-4 blocks tall without a wind shield and shitty wheels
help 2021-01-03 03:02:08 if you do it then ping me with a pic of it, wanna know how others do
