The Tale of circle31415 (428948212225933312)
help 2020-04-17 11:07:13 this is a drone im buliding with a really large rotor
help 2020-04-17 11:07:33 
help 2020-04-17 11:07:41 however, when i turn on the motor, the motor does not rotate the propeller part, it rotates both the propeller part and body part
help 2020-04-17 11:07:59 ive known this problem, but i have yet to fix it
help 2020-04-17 11:09:58 should i make the propeller smaller?
help 2020-04-17 11:10:51 counter rotor
help 2020-04-17 11:10:55 ohh wait i get it
help 2020-04-17 11:11:40 wait how would i attach the body to the rotor then
help 2020-04-17 11:22:31 it works
help 2020-04-17 11:22:42 i pressed r and it flew in a flash
help 2020-04-17 11:34:35 i got another question
help 2020-04-17 11:34:47 is there any sort of heavy blocks in the game
help 2020-04-17 11:35:09 this is so i can make compact counterweights
help 2020-04-17 11:35:20 oh
help 2020-04-17 11:59:18 
help 2020-04-17 11:59:20 well great
help 2020-04-17 11:59:30 one rotor isnt spinning
help 2020-04-17 12:11:37 your character does not affect the weight
help 2020-04-17 12:12:05 from my experience, dont put the propellers like a +
help 2020-04-17 12:12:15 do it more like a X
help 2020-04-17 12:12:38 its way more stable
help 2020-04-17 12:19:53 ok yeah i see it now
help 2020-04-17 12:20:00 but it was real tiny
help 2020-04-17 12:24:09 ok so
help 2020-04-17 12:24:29 i tried the two rotors thing but it didnt work rn
help 2020-04-17 12:25:03 when one rotor spun opposed to the other it didnt move
help 2020-04-17 12:40:43 Can I ask for help on my problem now?
help 2020-04-17 12:42:30 
help 2020-04-17 12:42:47 so in the picture I used 2 rotors to prevent the drone body from spinning
help 2020-04-17 12:42:56 now only the lower propeller spins
help 2020-04-17 12:45:20 actually in the current version I removed the top part of the body connecting to the top motor
help 2020-04-17 12:45:25 the same thing happened
help 2020-04-17 12:45:39 how
help 2020-04-17 12:46:51 wait what
help 2020-04-17 12:47:13 I guess I'll put a block in between the two motors
help 2020-04-17 12:49:29 why
help 2020-04-17 12:49:38 is that not gonna work or
help 2020-04-17 15:53:14 still havent figured out how to make one rotor copters
help 2020-04-17 15:54:23 no no no it isnt that simple
help 2020-04-17 15:54:42 you use 1 motor, and the body part it is attached to spins
help 2020-04-17 15:54:53 2 motors, the same thing happens
help 2020-04-17 15:55:12 this is why when making a drone, you use multiple rotors
help 2020-04-17 15:55:29 you think i didnt try that?
help 2020-04-17 15:55:40 well i did
help 2020-04-17 15:55:49 body part still spins
help 2020-04-17 15:56:23 bruh
help 2020-04-17 15:58:14 ok it works
help 2020-04-17 15:58:16 thanks
help 2020-04-17 15:59:59 wait what
help 2020-04-17 16:00:16 oh wait now the body part is spinning again
help 2020-04-17 16:01:46 yes
creations-chat 2020-04-18 04:00:44 its WIP, but I call this thing Project Citadel
creations-chat 2020-04-18 04:02:50 is there anything i can do to uh, make my drone look nicer
creations-chat 2020-04-18 04:03:03 scroll up
creations-chat 2020-04-18 04:05:29 so motor + propeller system?
help 2020-04-18 10:25:16 I decided that this drone needs a gyroscope, but because the main propulsion is the center propeller I'm not sure how, any ideas?
help 2020-04-18 10:25:52 pilot seat is inside that glass chamber
help 2020-04-18 10:26:07 because it keeps tilting
help 2020-04-18 10:26:30 a what
help 2020-04-18 10:28:20 ok excuse me what
help 2020-04-18 10:28:36 there is absolutely no way I can attach a swashplate on the drone
help 2020-04-18 10:40:45 I'm probably just gonna leave my drone as is, not like it will crash if I dont add anything to stabilize it
help 2020-04-18 10:44:39 I'm at somewhere else that isnt my house
help 2020-04-18 10:44:45 therefore I cant join sorry
help 2020-04-18 15:46:15 
help 2020-04-18 15:46:28 need help on the turrets
help 2020-04-18 15:46:42 they use motor2s, so they aim with cursor
help 2020-04-18 15:47:29 but uh, they move uncontrollably, a lot, and their accuracy when aimed is terrible
help 2020-04-18 15:48:14 how low
help 2020-04-18 15:55:38 after a while of fixing the turrets
help 2020-04-18 15:55:58 i realized this one turret as pointing up because i used normal motor
help 2020-04-18 15:56:47 this is what happens when i bulid something big
help 2020-04-18 15:57:00 source of errors are smaller than a grain of salt
help 2020-04-18 16:04:02 bro i was testing my drone turrets and someone lauched a missile at it and crashed it
help 2020-04-18 16:04:24 check center of lift and weight
creations-chat 2020-04-18 16:51:22 [NAME]: Project Citadel
[BLOCKS]: 1060
creations-chat 2020-04-18 16:52:53 oh no it actually flys
creations-chat 2020-04-18 16:52:55 sorry
creations-chat 2020-04-18 16:53:16 i think you guys cant see the propellers
creations-chat 2020-04-18 16:53:25 ill send a front view
creations-chat 2020-04-18 16:53:46 oh
creations-chat 2020-04-18 16:53:55 was confused there
creations-chat 2020-04-18 16:54:41 [front view] (note: yes the thing flh
creations-chat 2020-04-18 16:54:58 dammit was about to say it flies
creations-chat 2020-04-19 15:41:13 an "improved" version of the biggest drone i make w/o folds
creations-chat 2020-04-19 15:41:36 will probably stop there and make a fighter jet instead
creations-chat 2020-04-19 15:41:46 you talking to me blast?
creations-chat 2020-04-19 15:42:48 well yeah it flies, but at like 60 sps
creations-chat 2020-04-19 15:43:07 this is meant to be a capital class drone of sorts
creations-chat 2020-04-19 15:44:44 actually if your taking about it's speed when it goes straight up its 15 sps
creations-chat 2020-04-19 15:45:12 when tilting moderately to move, that's 60 sps
creations-chat 2020-04-19 15:45:24 yeah
creations-chat 2020-04-19 15:47:00 next huge drone would use jet or rocket propulsion instead since idk how to make a bigger propeller and 2 gigantic propellers is too much for a drone imo
creations-chat 2020-04-19 15:49:32 argh dammit i knew i gotta make it fast, im adding secondary propellers
creations-chat 2020-04-20 07:20:20 what in the russian pancakes just happened
creations-chat 2020-04-20 07:20:54 who unde
creations-chat 2020-04-20 07:21:28 oh hes the dude that posted the plane with the control surfaces
help 2020-04-20 10:16:57 p38 lightning cockpit, is there room for improvement?
creations-chat 2020-04-20 14:49:43 he done an oopsie
help 2020-04-20 15:47:35 Problem 1: the two centers are out of alignment
Problem 2: plane keeps spinning to the left when propellers are turned on
help 2020-04-20 15:49:55 done
help 2020-04-20 15:50:02 i knew that basic knowledge
help 2020-04-20 15:50:09 yet it keeps going to the left
help 2020-04-20 15:50:41 plane is probs to too heavy to take off
help 2020-04-20 15:50:58 oh damm they are
help 2020-04-20 15:59:14 forget this plane, i got rid of it
help 2020-04-20 15:59:32 it's too broken to be even fixed
help 2020-04-21 12:14:00 
help 2020-04-21 12:14:02 p38 can't fly
help 2020-04-21 12:14:11 do i have to reduce the weight?
help 2020-04-21 12:15:22 yes
help 2020-04-21 12:15:49 you talking about the giant propellers?
help 2020-04-21 12:21:16 what
help 2020-04-21 12:30:43 bruh even with 7 super rocket the thing wont fly
help 2020-04-21 12:30:54 why am i bad at this game

help 2020-04-21 12:31:11 yes
help 2020-04-21 12:34:52 what was it that got other people's propeller planes to fly but not my p38
help 2020-04-21 12:36:37 what's concerning me is that i don't know what makes a plane fly
help 2020-04-21 12:40:43 and also how are you supposed to make a 200 block plane
help 2020-04-21 12:42:27 i think im gonna take a lil break, i cant make a 200+ plane without ending with an overweighted plane
help 2020-04-24 16:16:27 
help 2020-04-24 16:16:29 need help on the two centers
help 2020-04-24 16:18:22 can anyone help

help 2020-04-24 17:16:28 to prevent lag and stuff

help 2020-04-25 03:42:59 previously i asked for help but a non-ranked player told me to extend the wings forward, and im not sure if thats the right answer
help 2020-04-25 03:44:32 how do i tilt the vertical things
help 2020-04-25 03:44:57 thats like next level moves only a wizard can do

help 2020-05-05 12:23:32 so putting 2 ballast beams with density 20 the back of the aircraft made it fly
help 2020-05-05 12:23:45 but now i gotta improve it, somehow
help 2020-05-05 12:26:41 so one problem i found with the addition of ballast blocks that now it can sometimes wobble
creations-chat 2020-08-29 16:11:05 just a drone
creations-chat 2020-08-29 16:11:36 maybe I could put on a gyroscope
creations-chat 2020-08-29 16:12:05 dunno how, the center has a bunch of super rockets to steer it
creations-chat 2020-08-29 16:12:20 > the center looks like a light blue cancer tumor
I am sorry you think of it like that
creations-chat 2020-08-29 16:12:43 what the hecc is a box
