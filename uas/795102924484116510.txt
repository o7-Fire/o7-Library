help 2021-03-30 07:04:45 ok every time I get shot/blow myself up in my starship my entire game freezes and I have to use task manager to shut it down. it's only this one ship that this happens to. anyone know what's going on?
help 2021-03-30 07:06:32 it's not even a big build, if anything it's one of my mediumish sized builds so it's not like the size is messing it up
help 2021-03-30 07:40:35 For some reason my ships are turning, but it's perfect. I can turn very well at high speeds all of the sudden and I'm not sure why. Even my largest ship is preforming much better. I've had this happen before but it stopped a day or two later. Anyone able to tell meh what's going on so I can keep doing it?

I built a 2k+ block build and I want to give a copy to a friend. Is there ANY way I could just let them quickly copy and paste it? Or do they have to manually place each block?
