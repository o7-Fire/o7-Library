creations-chat 2021-10-11 04:08:40 gimme tips for tank building. This is my first tank
creations-chat 2021-10-11 04:11:11 -_-
creations-chat 2021-10-11 04:14:13 here's the thing. Im on a potato pc so for fps' sake, I keep it low
creations-chat 2021-10-11 04:16:21 ü•î
p o t a t o
creations-chat 2021-10-11 04:18:55 thing is, my pc is not too bad but its just the bigger servers that lag a lot. soooooo i cant rlly do much for graphics.
creations-chat 2021-10-12 05:36:40 v-22 prop and wings done. Just body left
creations-chat 2021-10-12 05:38:53 body's a bit hard to make tho. Pretty much done with the front
creations-chat 2021-10-12 05:50:09 one mile is around 6500 studs right? So 18k mph would be 72000 studs per second? essentially ur going 72k sps if u say 18k mph. I think I'm getting the math wrong
creations-chat 2021-10-12 05:52:16 wait its studs per second not hour. Gimme a few mins to get the right calculation
creations-chat 2021-10-12 05:56:19 If an actual sr-71 was in game, I think it would travel at like 882 studs per second which is 52920 studs per hour. Im in online maths and I'm focusing on calculating the speed of a plane in a video game
creations-chat 2021-10-12 06:02:34 3,529 km/h to meters per second is 980. sooo 980 x 4 will take ur studs per second speed. Which is like 3920 sps. the speed of sound in plane crazy is 1327 so its pretty much mach 2.7 ish
creations-chat 2021-10-12 06:04:49 Here ya go. I searched SR-71 top speed. U got a different one.
creations-chat 2021-10-12 06:07:02 I took the speed of sound thing from torb's video. It was almost on point except for the 0.25 instead of 0.28
creations-chat 2021-10-12 06:13:54 one stud is 0.28 meters. The updated devlogs show it so 4 studs is now 1 meter

I'm closer than u
creations-chat 2021-10-12 06:15:59 The opportunity to secure ourselves against defeat lies in our own hands, but the opportunity of defeating the enemy is provided by the enemy himself.
-Sun Tzu: The Art of War
Good argument tho. I was bored in math classes.
creations-chat 2021-10-12 06:18:39 The power of Sun Tzu
creations-chat 2021-10-12 06:22:05 my calculation of its mach is a bit off tho. Imma calculate that real quick
creations-chat 2021-10-12 06:26:04 0.28 studs x4 is 1.12. 980 divided by 1.12 is 875. 875 x 4 is 3500
There. That is the speed of a sr-71
creations-chat 2021-10-12 06:28:52 299 792 458 meters per second is the speed of light. So the speed of light in plane crazy is 1070687350 sps

FASTEST HAND IN THE WEST BISH
wait no east
creations-chat 2021-10-12 06:44:23 Hell naw I'm in history. It has the best teacher. I ain't got time
creations-chat 2021-10-12 06:46:55 It would be cool-ish if we had a plane crazy group based around calculating scale and proportion in a block game. I had to check the size of a v-22 osprey. It would be around 70 blocks in-game for a 1:1 scale replica
creations-chat 2021-10-13 05:10:18 How's the shape so far of my V-22
creations-chat 2021-10-14 07:58:50 Try to fix the cockpit. Looks to flat on top. Add a half wedge down 1x2 and 2 half blocks then another half wedge down 1x2. Design looks pretty good along with the colour scheme
Maybe custom landing gear can help

creations-chat 2021-12-15 10:45:14 thoughts on my v4 compact suspension. Ski version is only there for winter but it looks cool and functions pretty well
creations-chat 2021-12-15 17:05:21 should i or should i not add an elf at the back on skis with suspension on him for bumps. He can be my wheelie bar lol
creations-chat 2021-12-15 17:07:59 thanks for the idea. Imma also add like a trail using a motor and some trail blocks. Santa's coming to your house in style üòé
I anyways have some time to work on it
creations-chat 2021-12-15 17:22:16 the elf is working. still testing tho
creations-chat 2021-12-15 18:05:43 what else should I add to santa's newest sleigh. Elf wheelie bar, smol reindeers and spoiler thing are done. I will try to add as many things as possible
creations-chat 2021-12-15 18:08:41 it is the tactical sleigh with santa's paint theme on it. idk i was just bored ig. Just tell me what to add. Im gonna paint it normal later anyways
creations-chat 2021-12-15 18:12:14 hmmm good idea. I will use it for reference later. I just want to know what to add to my extremely stupid sleigh
creations-chat 2021-12-15 18:15:38 ahh yes. Turn santa's new sleigh into a modified military vehicle with a disproportionately large fan at the back. U have a good mind
creations-chat 2021-12-15 18:24:56 ahh yes. Hippies in Russia.
creations-chat 2021-12-17 13:08:50 <@!707953054489509978> tell me your ways. How do I add upvotes to a creation <:Thinkje139:590548255927173201>

creations-chat 2022-03-14 15:08:32 its a steering rack that works with suspension in game on a small scale compared to others. It has the same functions and stability as any of the other bigger ones posted how is it not realistic tho
creations-chat 2022-03-14 15:10:57 nvm ur right. I'll try to add that to the next design. didnt know before thanks
