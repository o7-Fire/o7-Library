creations-chat 2020-06-30 03:39:45 join another game
creations-chat 2020-07-23 04:35:00 how do you get gud at building
creations-chat 2020-07-23 04:35:29 ik i already have like 5 days in this game and i still cant even make a good lookin cube
creations-chat 2020-07-23 04:36:09 oh in game play time i have played this game for over 2 years
creations-chat 2020-07-23 04:36:25 in game only 5 days
creations-chat 2020-07-23 04:36:44 im dum
creations-chat 2020-07-23 04:36:51 i cant type
creations-chat 2020-07-23 04:37:12 so basically i have like 100 hours over 1 and ahalf yers
creations-chat 2020-07-29 00:48:15 cool
creations-chat 2020-11-26 17:38:48 what have i created
creations-chat 2020-11-26 17:40:42 keep in mind that mechanism is made completely of motors no hover engine stuff here
bot-central 2020-12-20 05:01:21 ?shelp
creations-chat 2020-12-27 01:16:05 yeah lol
creations-chat 2020-12-27 01:18:06 it was just a concept to tryout the extendable thrust bays
creations-chat 2021-03-03 06:49:05 imagine using motor lock
creations-chat 2021-03-07 07:18:40 looks nice although i wish we had better tools to use in this game for more fine details and making this easier to build
creations-chat 2021-03-07 07:20:41 a scale and rotation tool would be amazing
i have seen some of the insane builds from build a boat for treasure and if we could get that level of scale and detail in this game it would be a life changer
creations-chat 2021-03-07 07:30:33 dont hate on asymmetrical builds
the-dump 2021-03-09 15:30:52 omg did he say cuss word
the-dump 2021-03-09 15:31:44 oh no you cussed again your going to jail to eat brocli
the-dump 2021-03-09 15:32:20 damn my 5 year old kid logic failed me

the-dump 2021-03-09 15:35:49 the imposter is sus
the-dump 2021-03-09 15:36:16 amogus
creations-chat 2021-04-06 17:41:54 why do people use control surfaces when you can use gyroscopes
creations-chat 2021-04-06 17:43:56 you can create gyroscopes by rotating weight at high speeds i use it for my bigger builds
creations-chat 2021-04-06 17:48:21 I dont know much about fighter jets in planecrazy as im a mega builder but I think there are easier methods to get good maneuverability when flying than just spamming control surfaces because having too many control surfaces would actually cause a lot of drag
creations-chat 2021-04-06 17:53:37 what about using gimble thrusters
creations-chat 2021-04-06 17:56:21 you can cram a gimble system with motor lock
creations-chat 2021-04-06 17:58:35 Laughs in a literal mobile oil rig with full AA
creations-chat 2021-04-06 18:07:06 try hitting a moving target
creations-chat 2021-04-06 18:14:53 that would be too close as a single flak would detonate those bombs before they even got close
creations-chat 2021-04-22 14:37:42 i think most people have an irrational fear of WIP builds
creations-chat 2021-04-22 14:40:06 i could post my 90% completed megabuild and people would still downvote it but in reality you should not care about what others think
creations-chat 2021-06-06 19:08:41 this was just a concept to figure out if i could make a build that only uses hover thrust and it works should i do anything else with it?
creations-chat 2021-07-09 02:58:11 ok im building a chess bot anyone have any good idea for chess pieces
creations-chat 2021-07-09 03:18:00 I wonder what this gear could be used for it meshes pretty well
creations-chat 2021-07-09 03:20:02 yeah that could work differing gear ratios could be used interestingly although the roblox engine does not always agree with stuff like that
creations-chat 2021-07-09 04:15:07 i dont use motor lock loal
creations-chat 2021-07-09 04:17:51 oh that boat is dog crap (mine)
creations-chat 2021-07-09 04:20:34 loal yeah it was awful i only made that boat to test out a certain feature and the funny thing is it does actually have some motor lock in it
creations-chat 2021-07-09 04:22:39 i also made whatever the hell this is
creations-chat 2021-07-09 04:27:04 i noticed that as well
the thing is if i want to make something that looks good ill just build it in build a boat for treasure i just like this game for more things you can do mechanics wise
creations-chat 2021-07-09 04:43:45 D1? oh yeah i guess it does
creations-chat 2021-08-15 03:13:34 ok so i am building a gear based artillery thing but the motor keeps slipping not the gears but the motor even with max torque any ideas on how to stop that. current idea is a suspension arm limiter but im worried that would limit the pitch range of the gun.
creations-chat 2021-08-15 03:25:26 aeiou still no ideas
creations-chat 2021-09-03 05:22:19 hot take: motor lock is over rated
creations-chat 2021-09-03 05:24:22 time to join the military so i can use military time
creations-chat 2021-09-03 05:26:24 the motorlock being overrated was a joke designed to anger the people in this chat and yes i do know how to use mortarlak but i primarily make megabuilds so its not used as much in my creations
creations-chat 2021-09-03 05:28:52 sounds crazy but im going to go finish my hover traiin
help 2021-09-05 18:23:59 ballast blocks
the-dump 2021-09-21 06:14:44 plane crazy 2 leak (real)
the-dump 2021-09-21 06:17:46 last plane crazy 2 leak (SUPER REAL)
the-dump 2021-09-21 06:20:35 no its plane crazy competitor that actually shows promise and is not dog crap with things like a dynamic off set tool so we dont have to use motorlock for everything

the-dump 2021-09-21 06:25:22 dont tell the mods that the game has completely customizeable wedges
the-dump 2021-09-21 06:25:37 where you can set values like a 6.45675 wedge if your really want
the-dump 2021-09-21 06:25:57 allowing for proper creativity unlike the basic block options we have
the-dump 2021-09-21 06:26:26 pc2 must be really good

the-dump 2021-10-17 02:30:06 they did ban that game from being said
the-dump 2021-10-17 02:30:18 guess they dont like competition
the-dump 2021-10-17 02:30:38 vehical creator i even have to say it incorrectly
