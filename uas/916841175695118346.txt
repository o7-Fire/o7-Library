The Tale of iinr_guest001 (916841175695118346)
creations-chat 2022-03-07 07:42:08 To be honest I feel like everybody is way to expectant of people skills and just criticize more than approve of creations
creations-chat 2022-03-07 07:44:12 Yeah but I feel we all get a little to strict on the creations, even if it is what we expect or like
creations-chat 2022-03-07 07:48:08 A lot less people have really good building skills then we expect

help 2022-03-07 08:11:22 Which part of the walking?
help 2022-03-07 08:12:04 Yeah
help 2022-03-07 08:12:44 Ive seen people were they do mix of like powered and unpowered to make it like a knee that moves, but also with some freedom
help 2022-03-07 08:13:08 Ive never been able to make a fully functional leg before quitting thoughüòï
help 2022-03-07 08:13:44 Tutorials are only good really for smaller compact mechs with like folding heads and extra decor
help 2022-03-07 08:13:57 Yeah
help 2022-03-07 08:14:48 Ive got a friend with a few big mechs but he‚Äôs always just working on the heads so I don‚Äôt really know üòï
help 2022-03-07 08:15:06 Mechs are hard, it makes sense
help 2022-03-07 08:16:34 Mechs and motor lock is more complicated I think, because it has to stress inside of moving blocks
help 2022-03-07 08:17:44 To start I would make it more rocket powered and a free rotating motor and then add on to that once you get the hang of the physics of the rest of the mech
help 2022-03-07 08:18:17 Like wait until you know the weight and balance first, then start manually motoring the legs
help 2022-03-07 08:18:50 That helps a lot for the balance
help 2022-03-07 08:19:17 Like a vid?
help 2022-03-07 08:20:54 He wants to power the knees more to make it more walking like
help 2022-03-07 08:21:07 Those were freely rotating from what I saw
help 2022-03-07 08:22:33 Are you able to show like a screenshot?
help 2022-03-07 08:22:51 I wanna see the shape
help 2022-03-07 08:23:11 This man is devoted to this mech
help 2022-03-07 08:24:18 Oh?
help 2022-03-07 08:25:52 So you‚Äôve just had a hollow lego moc just sitting in your desk for 3 years?
help 2022-03-07 08:26:32 K
help 2022-03-07 08:27:07 Oh so you just started the legs
help 2022-03-07 08:27:26 Ok
help 2022-03-07 08:28:27 Sure?
help 2022-03-07 08:30:09 Little, I just know basics from watching, but still wanna see if I can help at all, since I feel bad on how long this is taking, also I‚Äôve built a few smaller mechs so yeah

creations-chat 2022-05-31 20:36:26 I feel like everybody in this server has to become a lot less reliant on people making the best builds ever and just accept that not everything is going to be the absolute best but still good
creations-chat 2022-05-31 20:38:49 I‚Äôm saying that even really good ones people don‚Äôt like usually
creations-chat 2022-05-31 20:41:00 I don‚Äôt even recognize that avatar- that was prob a long time ago-
