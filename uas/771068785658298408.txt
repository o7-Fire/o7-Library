creations-chat 2022-11-12 05:26:38 Like when building ‚Äòem, which way do you fold them‚Äîthere isn‚Äôt enough space on plots most of the time
creations-chat 2022-11-12 05:29:06 O thx! I‚Äôm thinking about making some kind of destroyer bc cruisers can‚Äôt do PvP lol- I made the same mistake when making my sr-71, it‚Äôs a recon plane.

creations-chat 2022-11-12 20:19:52 bro this anti aircraft gun is too tall, isn't it? It also (im pretty sure) shouldn't be on land like that
creations-chat 2022-11-13 02:10:24 that plane deserves hof no cap
creations-chat 2022-11-13 02:57:21 decent...build...?...
creations-chat 2022-11-16 20:23:19 <@691799323926855719> that‚Äôs a pretty damn accurate ship, I have an idea of which one you based it on. I would put more detail onto the deck, and perhaps on the side hull. When it comes to the front, make it look a bit more smooth.
creations-chat 2022-11-16 20:27:16 These are pretty damn similar, good job <@691799323926855719>, although curving that front of the main tower thing might help
creations-chat 2022-11-16 20:29:18 I‚Äôm just trying not to be a piece of shit to people lol
