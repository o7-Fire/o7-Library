Maybe like make a short vid on how the tracks work

If youre not looking for looks you can show its features
Because then it just looks like a tutorial at first glance

I mean, the more i look at 
The more okay it looks

But the camo doesnt really blend in so much
Darker tracks would be nice
creations-chat 2022-08-23 12:39:23 BRO I WAS GIVING MY HONEST OPINION🤬

i really am not a fan of the paint
I was saying that it could be better
creations-chat 2022-08-23 12:43:37 Well you dont have to make it green
The paint is ok is it just doesnt blend in as much

I was thinking that you could make the bright colours somewhat darker?
If you manage to find a way to do it?

I thought he was okay when he mentioned like "you guys dont criticise" and stuff like that but the fact thay hes using screenshots and blackmailing isnt really... its kinda uncool

Its like calling the teacher and being praised for reporting on your classmate who said a no no word
creations-chat 2022-08-23 13:32:02 Thats like a 2 years ago

It shouldnt hurt that much
Its pretty common for people to build like that

creations-chat 2022-08-24 09:39:54 No toxicity here

Before we say anything we have to convey our thoughts🧐
creations-chat 2022-08-24 09:43:45 I read every single word
Looks like youve really thought about this
But my honest thoughts are bullshit

Its bad but you do have the heart to build👍
creations-chat 2022-08-24 09:45:57 Im glad you take constructive criticism lightly
creations-chat 2022-08-24 09:48:04 My favourite colour is green
Ill let the pissy poo paint pass
creations-chat 2022-08-24 09:50:13 I dont have to spray paint them

I litterally shit green
creations-chat 2022-08-24 09:52:27 Atleast he got one upvote <:ElonApprove:589130525315301380> 

One upvote can go a long  way<:clueless:942802644043464734>
creations-chat 2022-08-24 09:58:36 <@723204794671562882> 

Its litterally impossible to upvote this

Ive been trying a bunch of times but it wont let me💀
creations-chat 2022-08-24 15:23:50 Pretty cool👍
creations-chat 2022-08-25 09:06:22 Theres nothing to warn
Its just devastating
creations-chat 2022-08-25 13:51:16 Thanks 

Actually i built the bike first
Also i do struggle sometimes when it comes to small crafts since theyre quite hard to balance  and detail when theyre using hovers
Even worse, motor lock

But however...
I do actually appreciate that you acknowledge the details
I understand the the details sometimes stand out than the actual craft but ill try to prevent that in the further future👍
creations-chat 2022-08-25 13:53:30 Atleast i appreciate your critique DUMBASS🖕
Smh😭

creations-chat 2022-08-25 14:12:06 Thats like the only good build he has so hes resposting fr fr💀

Only one craft has 100 upvotes and it has a filter on
creations-chat 2022-08-25 14:14:08 I take it back
It does kinda look mid
He just uses the filter to get more upvotes
creations-chat 2022-08-25 14:25:04 I was going to say the same but i just thought it was rude to say👉👈

How do i even say 'it looks mid' respectfully
creations-chat 2022-08-25 14:27:55 0/46 ratio 😭😭

Fr
creations-chat 2022-08-25 14:32:31 Cmon

creations-chat 2022-08-25 14:35:19 Yeah the ratio was worth it
creations-chat 2022-08-26 01:47:24 I alwaysed assumed that pc2 was a myth
creations-chat 2022-08-26 04:01:38 Incase if you guys havent seen this thing walk

Ive realised that there is a few seconds of emptiness so please be patient and wait

I forgot to cut the vid a bit shorter

Your build is pretty cool
Love the colours👍

I also find it quite it find appealing in the way on how you utilized the signs and the headlights
And i like the overhang too

I also find it quite cool that you used trail parts as guide rails instead of overusing ladders
creations-chat 2022-08-27 14:24:12 Np : )
