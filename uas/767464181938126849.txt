creations-chat 2023-04-01 01:39:09 It does I get 20 fps. Okay I also get a 300 ping jump. Also your more of a dumb shit cuz pistons do affect fps dumb shit. Cuz more offset parts and more shit for the shitty game engine to calculate. (Pov: doesn't know a flying fuck about how code in physics engines work)
creations-chat 2023-04-01 01:45:34 Thanks for support and constructive feedback. I can also show you the amount of pistons that i have remaining, which is 947, which you can substract from 999 to get 52 :). ‚ù§Ô∏è it's not that bad but okay, keep hating ü§£

creations-chat 2023-04-01 01:50:24 Legacies are way simpler, less angles on the wings, elevators, etc. His livery is also less complex than mine. But hey thanks for constructive criticism and helping new PC players improve their building skills ‚ù§Ô∏è
creations-chat 2023-04-01 01:52:30 I never defended it,and out of nowhere says it's a piece of shit. Fucking idiot. I fixed the issue you pointed out in my build

I'm sorry buddy, but even if fedgent is a bit of a hater of me (üò≠ cuz mini build) hes still way better than like 99 percent of the player base, and he just likes to do a little trolling

creations-chat 2023-05-01 17:46:01 <@913951588756914197>  why downvote (floppa nature pls give color codes then) (also how messy) (why is it messy)(how fix)
creations-chat 2023-05-01 17:49:10 i cant make it any smaller cuz PLANE CRAZY (didnt go for perfect roscale+ur builds arent any more size accurate)
creations-chat 2023-05-01 17:51:33 i cant really make it higher cuz i used advanced cam lock to get it to work, and if i raised the seat it would just not work. (fluffy fox, those builds dont use cylinders as the front bumper do they
