creations-chat 2022-06-05 15:01:48 Just a question, is there a way to have different sides of a wing panel different colors? for example, blue on the top and white on the bottom
creations-chat 2022-06-05 15:04:26 is there a tutorial on how to do that
creations-chat 2022-06-05 15:09:38 is there a tutorial for piston locking for coloring wing panels

help 2022-07-13 01:01:16 question: is there a way to make mini tank barrels look slightly realistic, i tried using sparklers or whatever they're called but some just fall off when i spawn
help 2022-07-13 01:05:49 do you have a screenshot of the unloaded barrel so i can understand what that means, i'm quite new to the game. I understand motor locking, but how do you ''ground'' something to a cylinder?
help 2022-07-13 01:06:34 Alright
help 2022-07-13 01:24:29 thank you for the help
help 2022-07-13 01:25:23 thats a glitch i think
help 2022-07-13 01:25:47 it happens when the motor 2 is going fast
help 2022-07-13 01:26:04 although i am not sure
help 2022-07-13 02:27:49 i just put text 1x2 on the parts were the barrel was falling off when i spawned in and it worked also
help 2022-07-16 04:39:14 can someone help with this drone, it keeps spinning to the right and i have no idea why
help 2022-07-16 04:45:27 update: i tried putting the motors in red with inverted controls and now it just doesn't go up, but doesn't spin either.
the controls are(top, in red) F and R, speed 50.(bottom, in red) R and F, speed 25. (top, not in red) R and F, speed 50(bottom, not in red) F and R, speed 25.
help 2022-07-16 05:03:55 nvm my drone kind works now ig
help 2022-07-16 18:55:44 im trying to push this disconnector down Â½ blocks, but i don't know how. can any of you guys help?
help 2022-07-16 18:59:13 i tried but not enough space
help 2022-07-16 19:01:38 also the disconnector is connected to the wing panel to the right and the control surface 1x2 to the left so i cant figure out how to move it without having to delete those two
help 2022-07-16 19:02:48 also there is a single locked motor behind the number 01, i put it there so the two wings could go down half a block
help 2022-07-16 19:08:57 i tried that already, it doesnt work since the disconnector is connected to the wing panel and control surface 1x2
help 2022-07-16 19:13:45 idk
help 2022-07-16 20:07:20 thx for the help my guy
help 2023-02-14 21:27:12 does anyone know how to hide the 2 motors sticking out the side? it makes it look 10x uglier
help 2023-02-14 21:43:39 im in the process of changing it, so lets just ignore that ;)
help 2023-02-14 21:52:36 man this server really has high expectations for builds lol
help 2023-02-14 21:56:58 thanks, will do
