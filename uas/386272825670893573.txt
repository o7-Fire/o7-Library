creations-chat 2022-04-06 19:55:18 would you upvote my WIP R.M.S Leviathan? (note its not finished and it looks like a tutorial but its not so it might get afew downvotes)
creations-chat 2022-04-09 16:00:42 <@456226577798135808>  how is your cargo ship getting downvoted that looks fresh (from yesterday)
creations-chat 2022-04-09 16:03:30 i just posted a ship in <#384025409945337856>  expecting 1000 downvotes since people are picky <:FineTroll:626841259746656289>
creations-chat 2022-04-09 16:05:44 good for you people like a cessna more than a ship that took 1 and a half DAYS and actually looks alright
creations-chat 2022-04-09 16:07:46 its a custom ship so i just went with a random color combination (black and blue) people allways call them smoke stacks i call them funnels
creations-chat 2022-04-09 16:10:06 the hull looks fine to me but the colors i can kinda agree on (im still kinda new to building so expect more detail from me in the future)
creations-chat 2022-04-09 16:14:31 tipa ot erugifuC
creations-chat 2022-04-09 16:17:10 i feel the same way<:CertifiedMoment:570774089099116548> excuse me great jagrhars are you calling my ship a shit build? i put 1 day and a half of h a r d w o r k into that why the fu-
creations-chat 2022-04-09 16:28:50 damn my ship is doing horrible
creations-chat 2022-04-09 16:53:04 you were in my server when i was building it? lol
creations-chat 2022-04-09 18:10:11 so you downvoted my ship because it looked bad? kinda ðŸ§¢  if you ask me..
creations-chat 2022-05-05 18:55:51 <@601867377809948853>  where is the stern on the britannic
creations-chat 2022-05-27 04:22:01 <@759981751727816704>  its not ugly or blocky it looks good
creations-chat 2022-11-12 19:09:23 same lmao
creations-chat 2022-11-12 19:17:20 i made the funnel wayy too off centered (thats my fault for not looking at reference) i can prolly fix it tho
creations-chat 2022-11-12 19:19:24 yep its a (WIP) remastered version of my old carpathia in creations channel that got like 200 downvotes
creations-chat 2022-11-12 19:21:45 jesus christ someone made this in plane crazy?
creations-chat 2022-11-12 19:23:50 nah bro thats a southwest airlines boeing 737
creations-chat 2022-11-12 19:28:23 i mean building ships that big is pretty hard, i try my hardest when im building ships
creations-chat 2022-11-12 19:30:38 Q: idc how "low effort" it looks
A: no one asked
creations-chat 2022-11-12 19:34:04 its true tho, ive been playing stormworks just a little bit longer than plane crazy and its so much easier because you can drag place, mirror mode (which means that if you build something on one side it duplicates onto the other side), stormworks is just easier in my opinion and infact imma go showcase some of my stormworks stuff

and stormworks also has a WAY bigger build plot
creations-chat 2022-11-12 19:36:12 stormworks?
creations-chat 2022-11-12 19:38:50 its a game similiar to plane crazy where you can build ships, boats, planes, helicopters, anything really
you can buy it on steam for 25 USD
creations-chat 2022-11-12 19:41:49 just saw your ship in creations, that thing looks insane bro
creations-chat 2022-11-13 03:35:47 i learned how to do small motor lock stuff so im making a battleship with an angle locked bow but when i lock the motors they just do this, any fix?
creations-chat 2022-11-13 03:39:44 ikr its weird like when the motors arent locked, the motor can move, when the motors ARE locked, it cant move
no its not locked k ill try that
 that worked thanks
im new to motor locking so idk how to do alot of it yet lol
creations-chat 2022-11-13 03:49:43 now its not locking into place (its supposed to be 1 more block down)
creations-chat 2022-11-13 04:03:15 finally fixed it
creations-chat 2022-11-13 20:11:58 i did kinda the same thing with my bow
creations-chat 2022-11-14 03:03:49 <@577930642520801301>  how yall make these tiny ahh builds so detailed (let me guess, tons of motor lock?)
creations-chat 2022-11-14 03:10:35 ðŸ’€
creations-chat 2022-11-14 03:13:36 i wanna put this in <#384025409945337856> but i know its gonna get alot of downvotes so i might not
creations-chat 2022-11-14 03:19:13 i do agree with your point on the bow could use better shaping, but it is my first time using a bow like that, ive been always using flat wedge bows, this is  my first bow that actually has curvature to it
creations-chat 2022-11-14 03:21:24 alright ill keep that in mind for my next ship,
btw im also a very beginner at knowing how to motor lock so i still need to learn that
creations-chat 2022-11-14 03:24:44 will do
creations-chat 2022-11-14 03:40:20 how would i make the interior a different color from the exterior?
creations-chat 2022-11-14 04:57:32 currently adding angled rails onto my battleship

creations-chat 2022-12-18 00:24:19 sorta fixed the tail, now i need to hide the motor lock
creations-chat 2022-12-18 01:00:05 ill just say the exposed lock is custom detailing i guess
creations-chat 2022-12-18 03:28:38 no
creations-chat 2022-12-18 03:32:39 "my FIRST EVER f14"
creations-chat 2022-12-18 03:34:51 "no moving wings"
creations-chat 2022-12-18 03:37:57 i want yall to know that this is one of my first planes ive ever made, as i only build ships, correct?
creations-chat 2022-12-18 03:42:44 due to it being tiny theres really no way to hide the exposed lock, so i basically just count it as custom detailing
i might make the wings sweep tho now that you say it.
creations-chat 2022-12-18 03:47:20 can yall just stop roasting me ive never made a fighter jet before
creations-chat 2022-12-18 03:52:40 
creations-chat 2022-12-18 03:54:47 the wings are based off this model i found on sketchfab
creations-chat 2022-12-18 04:00:33 expecting to get roasted for the first ever plane that i made, a single engine propeller bomber thingy
creations-chat 2022-12-18 04:04:41 speaking facts, i posted an image of a boat that lacks so much detail and got like 4 hearts and no downvotes for it
creations-chat 2022-12-18 04:08:03 bro yall calling good looking builds shitty
creations-chat 2022-12-18 04:21:31 added partial wing sweep since yall begged for it
creations-chat 2022-12-18 04:32:07 I LAUGHED WAY HARDER TAHN I SHOULDVE AT THAT
creations-chat 2022-12-18 04:36:07 i was working on making the canopy shorter right now actually
creations-chat 2022-12-18 04:58:33 partly custom, based off the F14 and F22
creations-chat 2022-12-18 05:01:20 i looked at a f14 tomcat 3d model and just went to town
creations-chat 2022-12-18 05:18:49 fixed the tail wings sorta, still has exposed motor lock ðŸ˜¦
creations-chat 2022-12-19 22:44:43 i feel like i need to restart the stern because of this
creations-chat 2022-12-28 00:32:42 blocky stern or non blocky stern?
creations-chat 2022-12-28 00:40:57 idk i just thought the one with wedges looked like soro salt's stern
creations-chat 2023-01-01 03:42:11 i wanna show my new jet but im expecting to get roasted for it (its not my old goofy f14 thingy)
creations-chat 2023-01-01 03:48:59 alright ill post it just dont be too harsh

creations-chat 2023-01-01 03:53:50 i made it have square intakes, different fuselage design, better wing shape, i tried to add wing sweep but i just couldnt figure out how to do it (im about to get so damn roasted)
