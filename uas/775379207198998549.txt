help 2022-12-31 23:16:16 Uhh guys does the super speed game pass work on mobile? because it says Left CTRL to superspeed run but obviously there isn’t one on mobile
help 2022-12-31 23:17:54 Alright thanks I was just scared I was gonna buy it and it would say like (pc only) or something
help 2022-12-31 23:17:58 alright thanks
help 2022-12-31 23:19:18 Oh
help 2022-12-31 23:19:28 Yeah I guess so
help 2022-12-31 23:26:45 Superspeed got rid of my original run so now i cant just run originally lol
help 2022-12-31 23:26:50 Is that on pc too?
help 2022-12-31 23:27:59 ah crap……
help 2022-12-31 23:28:12 I don’t mind tho I can just slow down when I run I guess since I’m on mobile
help 2022-12-31 23:29:47 There was originally a button for running on mobile and I was expecting another button above it saying like “superspeed run” but instead it just makes my original run button become the superspeed
