bug-reports 2018-11-20 22:55:04 <@404688801580187652> no
bug-reports 2018-11-20 22:55:50 I tried that, the only way to get it to the other wide was to have it the wrong way around, making it completely pointless
bug-reports 2018-11-20 22:56:17 Because half block edges are on one side of the grid block, like half wedges that need an ul and down version
bug-reports 2018-11-20 22:56:27 No there isnt
bug-reports 2018-11-20 22:56:28 Lol
bug-reports 2018-11-20 22:56:40 I tried
bug-reports 2018-11-20 22:56:43 Everything
bug-reports 2018-11-20 22:57:05 I have 2 sides to that and one side worked and the other didnt
bug-reports 2018-11-20 22:57:48 Its not possible lol
bug-reports 2018-11-20 22:58:11 You have to replicate the exact situation because it is possible just not at that specific angle
bug-reports 2018-11-21 01:49:58 they are supposed to have a 1x1 block hitbox

bug-reports 2018-11-22 12:37:53 <@216371990959882241> its because when you move a build to the max in any direction, it actually is out of the plot by 1 block so it gets cut off when you save and load
creations-chat 2018-11-22 15:35:50 https://streamable.com/gltbc requesting submarine commander
creations-chat 2018-11-22 15:38:20 <@163143541160148992> can i get submarine  rank? https://streamable.com/gltbc
creations-chat 2018-11-22 15:46:30 <@456226577798135808> the amount of blocks doesnt really matter for the submarine rank
bug-reports 2018-11-23 01:58:01 <@286052871693139981> the flaps in the back and front move in different directions thats just how it has to be for them to work
bug-reports 2018-11-23 11:32:09 <@286052871693139981> the control surfaces in the front of the center of mass have to go the opposite way, if they didnt they would push the controls would be inverted
bug-reports 2018-11-23 11:32:16 You probably just didnt notice it
bug-reports 2018-11-28 19:54:49 <@319216576286949379> its because the center of lift is fucked up
