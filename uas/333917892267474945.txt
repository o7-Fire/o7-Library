creations-chat 2021-04-02 04:37:44 Now you gotta hope the tracks are getting an update.
creations-chat 2021-11-21 02:15:25 Not being one to take sides, I think you should look at images and creations, review the parts available to you and try. It's a bit shabby <@733504221172989994>  but you can always improve
creations-chat 2021-11-21 02:17:29 Look closer, there is a difference at the nose, back to a 2 minute cool down timer.


Edit, he's modelled it every so slightly different
creations-chat 2021-11-21 02:19:47 Yeh my perspective more than likely. As he pointed out, he changed a gun position, and probs anything else ever so slightly.
