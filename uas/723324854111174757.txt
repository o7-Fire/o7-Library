bot-central 2020-09-25 04:44:24 -mapsuggest we should have different materials with a different resistance to PvP weapons (eg) lava spitters take longer to melt diamond
bot-central 2020-09-25 04:47:03 -mapsuggest maybe for example, rocket engines not working underwater and being able to destroy the map (very lightly)
bot-central 2020-09-25 05:02:24 oh

creations-chat 2021-05-21 12:02:48 based on the lancelot in terms of color and somewhat design, i mainly just saw a good design on pinterest and thought why not and made it
