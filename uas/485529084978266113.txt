bot-central 2021-05-16 10:36:15 !suggest make it so if you hold control with the color picker tool you copy the material of the build, then holding down control and left clicking will make the block intot he material you copied.

1. A tool that works like a color picker but it picks material instead.
2. A bucket tool that colors every same color block that is connected to another.
3. ^ do the same but with materials.

this will be a huge help on big builds with people wanting to experiment between different colors and materials
