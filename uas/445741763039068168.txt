bug-reports 2019-09-27 20:19:01 on one of my planes the control surfaces only react when I move the mouse side to side and they stay still when I move the mouse up and down, making my plane unable to fly.
bug-reports 2019-09-27 23:20:57 This is my control seat, its attatched to the rest of the plane and everything
bug-reports 2019-09-27 23:21:06 idk what the problem is

creations-chat 2019-09-28 16:45:06 I realized I am talking about my planes but never showing them, so here is my most recent make, the Blue Angel! It has 171 blacks, is 3 blocks wide, and 4 blocks tall (excluding the 2 back rudders, which are both 5 blocks tall.) and has a wingspan of 23 blocks! It can reach speeds of about 400 studs a second. Hope ya'll like it.
