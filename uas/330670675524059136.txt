plane-crazy 2020-04-21 08:39:08 <@!163143541160148992> i mean, don't you thing the bridge area is a little too small for the warp cell size?
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 08:35:38 warping cells looking really big
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 08:30:51 i was just asking
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 08:30:48 i know
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 08:30:36 to make it happen
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 08:30:27 i'm guessing you're using folding
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 08:30:23 so
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 08:30:22 really big
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 08:30:19 it looks
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 08:30:18 i mean the new one you're building
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 08:30:14 well
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 08:29:38 <@!163143541160148992> are you using the folding method for the new one you're building?
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 08:27:49 must be a star trek fan?
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 08:27:36 the wings LOL
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 08:26:53 which one did you use?
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 08:26:29 o
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 08:26:08 and that flew perfectly?
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 08:25:25 what did you do to make it fly?
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 08:25:15 yess that
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 08:24:50 <@!163143541160148992> thats the one from wrath of khan, right?
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 08:24:23 mine looks a little ugly
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 08:24:20 i should really make some changes to the bottom bay
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 08:23:58 not surprised
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 08:23:40 how did you make it so it flies perfectly lol
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 08:21:13 i used glass just to xray, just for people to see the inside lol
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 08:20:55 but still a little wobbly, and not the most stable
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 08:20:43 replaced some rockets, added some wings in the front and back
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 08:20:25 https://gyazo.com/a155985eecc471e7c35cd9e53f0d4cc1 this is the system right now
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 08:19:34 <@!435946988559925248> https://gyazo.com/cf23908e5a851bd21972126b7636aada

okay i got the thing moving without wings, it's just a little hard to handle (going left and right) any suggestions from there?
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 06:34:21 <@!435946988559925248> do you think a magnet engine would work well with my ship?
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 05:57:08 LMAO
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 05:56:27 so basically just fit all of them inside the middle part?
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 05:56:13 okie okie
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 05:56:12 o
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 05:55:29 sorry, i'm not really used to all these plane terms, not the most experienced haha
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 05:54:48 rudders are the control panels right?
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 05:54:00 when you said put the wings inside, does that mean i take one of the three engines out? without that, i can't really fit anything inside
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 05:53:20 <@!435946988559925248> https://gyazo.com/557ebf30a72decbd190191e1a0fd2ea4 here, i replaced most of the jet engines to rocket engines 

it flies faster so that's good, but how do i make it wingless, and still flying?
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 05:40:28 okie okie
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 05:40:08 the wings don't have to be sharpened/delta wings, in order for me to fly it right?
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 05:37:44 or
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 05:37:43 <@!435946988559925248> so replace all jet engines to rockets, and once i remove wings, i should still be able to fly them?
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 05:36:40 so it gives lift on the warping cells
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 05:36:36 and i have a super rocket going upwards
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 05:36:24 i have it cut off at the end
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 05:36:10 yeah
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 05:35:52 it's the rocket flames that always distract me from using it, that's why i went jet lol
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 05:35:31 i should use rocket you're saying?
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 05:35:12 <@!435946988559925248> still a noob lol, wdym by rudder in the chonky parts?
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 05:34:52 woiah cool shipp
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 05:34:02 this is how it looks like with all the engines in place, if i remove the wings, it doesn't fly nor turn

any suggestion on what i should change?
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 05:32:46 lmao
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 05:32:25 but
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 05:32:25 i used helium in the big flat circle thing since it was really heavy
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 05:31:46 but that didn't go too well
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 05:31:42 i tried putting the wings inside the middle part of the ship
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 05:31:07 would it be possible to make this fly without the wings?
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 05:19:22 alright i'll try that, thanks!
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 05:18:25 like airplane engines? or rocket?
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 05:16:11 but it doesn't help me out with the turnings
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 05:16:03 it gives me a good lift
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 05:15:49 yeah, it's a little hard to control it
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 05:15:06 is it possible to make a ship without wings? i'm making the enterprise rn, and it's flying with wings, but i'm trying to make it without wings since i can't turn wings into glass blocks
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 05:10:37 lmao
