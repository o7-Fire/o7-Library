bug-reports 2021-02-11 14:30:14 I remember that they used to work normally with the weight, but after some update, for example, steel weighs as much as a regular block but ice is lighter than it
bug-reports 2021-02-11 14:30:49 yes
bug-reports 2021-02-11 14:30:50 but
bug-reports 2021-02-11 14:32:40 steel weighs the same as a normal block
