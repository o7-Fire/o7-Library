creations-chat 2022-02-26 20:25:35 Starting to make an Apache attack Helicopter
creations-chat 2022-02-26 20:27:39 it's a WIP the nose isn't done
creations-chat 2022-02-26 20:29:42 I'm not keeping it like that, I'm just mapping it out
creations-chat 2022-02-26 20:31:52 It's literally my second time making a heli
creations-chat 2022-02-26 20:35:36 I am starting over and watching a tut for motor locking
creations-chat 2022-02-26 21:57:15 definitely still a WIP but like, front of jet
creations-chat 2022-02-26 21:59:46 Notice how I said WIP? I'm changing the cockpit later.
creations-chat 2022-02-26 22:01:49 Well I don't really know how to design planes
creations-chat 2022-02-26 22:10:59 is this a better nose or not?
creations-chat 2022-02-26 22:31:09 Ig it's coming along
creations-chat 2022-02-26 22:35:01 You'll see
creations-chat 2022-02-26 22:37:10 Like this?
creations-chat 2022-02-26 23:23:10 cockpit prototype (ik it's bad)
creations-chat 2022-02-26 23:29:34 This is the cockpit without it being motorlocked and piston locked
creations-chat 2022-02-27 00:09:13 Should I make this a Jet or sumthin else?
creations-chat 2022-02-27 00:47:44 Progress on my fatass jet
creations-chat 2022-02-27 03:18:47 Anything I can do to fix this atrocious cockpit?
creations-chat 2022-02-27 03:29:04 Well sorry for not having as much experience as other people üòê
creations-chat 2022-02-27 03:31:23 I'm really in here trying to get advice but everyone's just toxic, so im prob just gonna talk in other text channels
creations-chat 2022-02-27 04:04:02 is this even a good nose and cockpit? Just say "yes" or "no" (jet)
creations-chat 2022-02-27 04:26:24 I actually didn't use motorlock but ok
creations-chat 2022-02-27 04:53:48 Not people replying to things that was posted like a millennium ago üíÄ
creations-chat 2022-03-05 22:36:28 It's ugly but its one of my first motorlocked noses
creations-chat 2022-03-05 22:39:42 This but a little bit better
creations-chat 2022-03-05 22:50:31 Is this nose good or...
creations-chat 2022-03-07 00:51:35 Ik it's not good at all. but I'll add motorlocking later and make it better
creations-chat 2022-03-07 01:23:03 I added a simple anglelock so the nose is slightly tilted down now
creations-chat 2022-03-07 01:28:11 Cuz I wanted to
creations-chat 2022-03-07 01:31:13 So like this? Also I want to have some advice on the cockpit.
creations-chat 2022-03-07 01:33:10 I'm not basing it off of a real plane, I'm just imagining it in my head.
creations-chat 2022-03-07 01:39:49 yea its pretty nice
creations-chat 2022-03-07 01:43:26 I'll try it
creations-chat 2022-03-07 01:58:33 There, its much better now
creations-chat 2022-03-07 02:25:12 Added that spike thing to the front
creations-chat 2022-03-07 02:34:16 I'm gonna start the wings from here cuz I think it looks cool
creations-chat 2022-03-07 02:43:52 This is how the wings are coming along, any suggestions?
creations-chat 2022-03-07 02:45:57 I wanted it long, I also wanted suggestions about the wings.
creations-chat 2022-03-07 02:48:02 No, I wanted suggestions on how to make the wings any better before I add more.
creations-chat 2022-03-07 03:12:11 I made it more like an f18s wing
creations-chat 2022-03-07 03:16:20 I'm actually trying to make this jet look descent and you have to do this? I'm not an expert designer like you.
creations-chat 2022-03-07 03:27:24 So something like this?
creations-chat 2022-12-03 23:22:41 This is the front of my jet so far (Not based on a irl jet)
