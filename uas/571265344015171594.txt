The Tale of r23x (571265344015171594)
creations-chat 2019-07-04 10:33:01 Kenworth Cabover, with a detachable trailer (Doesn't use magnets) and Optimus Prime's G1 Colors.
creations-chat 2019-07-04 10:34:23 Forgot to mention it has working lights, hazards and turn signals.
creations-chat 2019-07-04 10:34:25 Whoops.
creations-chat 2019-07-04 10:34:41 Yeah.
creations-chat 2019-07-04 10:40:14 Dang it, I noticed some things aren't colored in.
creations-chat 2019-07-04 10:40:30 I forgot that happened when my save file was slightly corrupted, where some parts were uncolored..
creations-chat 2019-07-04 10:42:34 Well, fixed it.
creations-chat 2019-07-06 20:30:49 what do you usually build
creations-chat 2019-07-06 20:30:59 hmm
creations-chat 2019-07-06 20:31:16 make a train that can open up with big guns
creations-chat 2019-07-06 20:31:18 or a bus
creations-chat 2019-07-06 20:31:20 either one
creations-chat 2019-07-06 20:31:36 a'ight
creations-chat 2019-07-06 20:31:38 gl
creations-chat 2019-07-06 20:46:09 I'm not sure why,
creations-chat 2019-07-06 20:46:25 It may be simple but what's the problem with that?
creations-chat 2019-07-06 20:46:46 Lego the joke failed
creations-chat 2019-07-06 20:46:56 big time
creations-chat 2019-07-06 20:47:08 Amazing
creations-chat 2019-07-06 21:11:25 Great looking boat on a great night.
bot-central 2019-07-07 08:47:22 ALL THE ANIME PFP'S
bot-central 2019-07-07 08:47:27 GAH
bot-central 2019-07-07 08:47:35 It's painful to watch.
bot-central 2019-07-07 15:01:30 !seaweed
bot-central 2019-07-07 15:01:43 I never used that command?
creations-chat 2019-07-07 20:42:44 it's not cursed
creations-chat 2019-07-07 20:42:46 it's good
creations-chat 2021-08-14 12:56:47 Started working on a mech, I just want to post the face so far so you can judge if it's accurate enough or not to what I base it off of (F71 G-Cannon from Mobile Suit Gundam F91)
creations-chat 2021-08-14 12:59:44 
creations-chat 2021-08-14 13:08:42 Just saying, if you actually want to thin out the nose; use longer wedges! It tends to make a big difference.
creations-chat 2021-08-14 13:11:01 Personally, I hate using glitch methods to build. So I simply don't use them, making whatever I accomplish slightly cooler to me as I had to figure out how to fit everything in.
creations-chat 2021-08-14 13:17:27 Yes. They were already patched once, yet people figured out how to keep using it; meaning it was an unintended feature that also technically "ruined" the simplicity of builds. It's not a bad thing that people use it, or want a more impressive looking build however I don't like using methods that are otherwise unintended.
creations-chat 2021-08-14 13:21:22 I see. That's cool, actually! Though, I personally still prefer my builds to be more "solid".
creations-chat 2021-08-14 13:23:35 Thank you very much, in that case! I want to become a mecha-builder, and motor lock seems to be necessary if I want to get smaller, but detailed in the future. I'll figure it out eventually, but for big builds I will continue being simple with.
creations-chat 2021-08-14 13:25:59 nO
creations-chat 2021-08-14 13:30:58 **I have never heard of a tractor called that way**
creations-chat 2021-08-14 13:37:57 Me when no 0.5x2 triangle wedges
creations-chat 2021-08-14 13:43:59 WHOA, BIG PLEEN
creations-chat 2021-08-14 13:46:35 yknow i always tell myself my 3-dimensional imagination is good, but no way in hell would i have thought of that
creations-chat 2021-08-14 14:39:43 Its almost cursed how clean that is
creations-chat 2021-08-14 16:30:39 nothing wrong with a tutorial if it teaches how things work
creations-chat 2021-08-14 16:42:01 What
creations-chat 2021-08-14 16:45:39 I mean yeah? I never mentioned posting them being fine, though?
creations-chat 2021-08-14 17:25:00 .. Yes, I'm pretty sure I explained I know that.
creations-chat 2021-08-14 17:35:15 Sure.
creations-chat 2021-08-14 17:46:36 That happens here all the time, for all kinds of reasons
creations-chat 2021-08-14 17:58:14 I like both actually
creations-chat 2021-08-14 19:39:20 man i like the idea of supersized normal things
creations-chat 2021-08-14 19:50:56 If I knew how to make a regular engine, maybe I'd attempt that
creations-chat 2021-08-15 07:08:48 oddly enough the most impressive mech i ever saw was that of a furry
creations-chat 2021-08-15 07:10:49 it had a lot of pre-set poses so you didnt have to do it all yourself one motor at a time, yet it still walked and was pretty dang small  while at it
creations-chat 2021-08-15 07:31:57 <:CertifiedMoment:570774089099116548>
creations-chat 2021-08-15 07:50:20 tbh, a good functional mechanism wins over speed imo
creations-chat 2021-08-15 07:53:56 and yet its not really the case, as it only takes a few seconds in itself
creations-chat 2021-08-15 08:09:27 no hes just being formal
the-dump 2021-08-15 08:12:52 reactions like these is exactly why furious keeps posting them
the-dump 2021-08-15 08:12:57 yall know that right
the-dump 2021-08-15 08:13:14 i just told you your and
the-dump 2021-08-15 08:13:37 wrong person
the-dump 2021-08-15 08:14:31 well yeah that one was rather suggestive
the-dump 2021-08-15 08:14:39 like dang
the-dump 2021-08-15 08:19:16 you make a new one
the-dump 2021-08-15 08:20:36 ok but fr i never heard of cold coffee
the-dump 2021-08-15 08:20:45 even less putting ice into it
the-dump 2021-08-15 08:20:47 like what
the-dump 2021-08-15 08:21:17 Literally sounds like a new drink idea some company would make
the-dump 2021-08-15 08:21:44 imagine reheating cold coffee later
the-dump 2021-08-15 08:21:49 good lord it'd be bad
the-dump 2021-08-15 08:22:36 hm
the-dump 2021-08-15 08:29:13 <:Duck:606204496695001091>
creations-chat 2021-08-15 08:30:42 DAYM I like that! Looks absolutely MEAN
creations-chat 2021-08-15 08:47:43 I dont judge what you post, I find your creation really cool! But just remember that if you think something isnt allowed, then it isnt.
creations-chat 2021-08-15 09:39:32 it is astrocraft
creations-chat 2021-08-15 11:20:47 depends on the use, maybe that one specifically is meant for destruction in vips?
no need for the aggression
the-dump 2021-08-15 12:54:00 yeah thats gonna get you warned
the-dump 2021-08-15 12:54:04 h
creations-chat 2021-08-15 12:58:02 i suppose that's a good point
the-dump 2021-08-15 13:02:12 man whats up with people trynna post things like that here
the-dump 2021-08-15 13:02:17 its a roblox game server
the-dump 2021-08-15 13:04:00 you think this is bad?
the-dump 2021-08-15 13:04:20 i mean it can be hell sometimes here but..
the-dump 2021-08-15 13:04:22 man
the-dump 2021-08-15 13:04:30 this aint nothing compared to other discords
the-dump 2021-08-15 13:04:51 except those that do

which is a bit much
the-dump 2021-08-15 13:05:03 some even got nsfw servers, sadly
the-dump 2021-08-15 13:05:09 things are weird
the-dump 2021-08-15 13:06:29 
the-dump 2021-08-15 13:10:14 you uh
the-dump 2021-08-15 13:10:36 sure are hellbent on destroying it
the-dump 2021-08-15 13:12:06 h e c k
the-dump 2021-08-15 13:15:40 mfw i cant come up with a decent joke
the-dump 2021-08-15 13:17:19 ye

creations-chat 2021-08-15 13:35:49 ngl i enjoyed the purple, it looked interesting

but yeah the gray is much more serious and cool lookin'
creations-chat 2021-08-15 13:45:06 I have no idea how I'll ever reach that number, especially considering the fact i like to keep block counts as low as possible for optimization cough
creations-chat 2021-08-15 14:50:57 yyyeah, I believe you should maybe just make the round roof out of *wedges*, as it's needlessly complicated for something that looks fairly simple everywhere else
creations-chat 2021-08-15 15:07:13 Hmm, saw this explosive ball launcher once that used a gear to pull back the springs.. I'll attempt something like that.
creations-chat 2021-08-15 18:25:25 Because we referred to the image you embedded when saying "ok", not the later one showing the map.
creations-chat 2021-08-15 18:48:58 Its charming, though I doubt anyone will respect that.
creations-chat 2021-08-15 18:51:41 i cant believe the idea that somethings vanilla is a valid reason to crap on builds here though <:bruhaps:646045387911725106>
creations-chat 2021-08-15 18:55:54 i feel horrible for people who genuinely get smashed 6 feet under for being relatively new

like man i havent seen anybody at least appreciate them learning fast in here
creations-chat 2021-08-15 18:57:58 jesus christ chill out yall this aint a competition, cut people some slack
creations-chat 2021-08-15 19:00:56 man

people never get along around here do they
creations-chat 2021-08-15 19:03:01 its understandable, i just dont like how people actively, and i mean this: b u l l y people for things that they themselves did at first, its like a superiority complex
creations-chat 2021-08-15 19:05:16 but yeah

pcc moment
creations-chat 2021-08-15 19:07:28 its unfortunately a curse for big discord servers to be filled with insensitive people, but if willing to ignore them its gonna be alright: everyone learns at their own pace, and the fact you dont use tutorials for it is highly admirable
creations-chat 2021-08-15 19:12:24 i wouldnt entirely agree, i believe tutorials are good to learn basic mechanics for what youre trying to build: a tutorial helped me learn how things function on mechs, and what the physics behind them are

the problem with this is some people blindly follow tutorials, without actually taking a while to realize how something theyre copying functions
creations-chat 2021-08-15 19:17:36 Its not as simple to get over being shat on by 5 different people, as for them to simply not type a few things out

Reviewing is supposed to be constructive, point out flaws and suggest possible improvements as well as solutions, where as all I saw here was the most evident case of "nobody gives a damn"
creations-chat 2021-08-15 19:19:48 And no, saying people should "make their builds more detailed" or anything similar isn't constructive, nor does it help them get a grasp on how to do it; it's more of shoving something down their throat, without explanation
creations-chat 2021-08-15 19:21:49 so we can agree on something at the very least, I'm glad
creations-chat 2021-08-15 19:25:26 its bad in the eyes of the experienced, not so much for a freshie
creations-chat 2021-08-15 19:29:22 Anybody honestly surprised?
creations-chat 2021-08-15 19:31:26 The crash test mobile? Pretty dang fun concept! I'd love to see it perform live
creations-chat 2021-08-15 19:39:36 its jawdropping tbh
creations-chat 2021-08-15 19:44:29 I thought it looked identical, even thought youre the same dude
creations-chat 2021-08-15 20:08:44 it keeps getting better and better
the-dump 2021-08-15 20:26:14 h
the-dump 2021-08-15 20:26:29 i honestly never heard people say why its bad before
the-dump 2021-08-15 20:27:41 me too
creations-chat 2021-08-15 20:31:54 looks pretty good to me, not sure what else can be done at this stage
creations-chat 2021-08-15 20:39:11 then.. I have a proposition: why not make the glass smaller?

Underatandable if it'll be out of scale, but just wondering
creations-chat 2021-08-15 20:53:21 its a WIP of course it has an exposed <:IntendedFeature:706289545548660746>
bot-central 2021-08-15 20:58:56 ehh i guess i can too
bot-central 2021-08-15 20:59:01 !rank
bot-central 2021-08-15 20:59:13 woah, 1 2
creations-chat 2021-08-16 06:20:37 sounds nitpicky
creations-chat 2021-08-16 06:52:59 Lookin' cool chief
creations-chat 2021-08-16 10:23:42 If you dont mind me asking, how much helium exactly is there in the limbs compared to the torso?
creations-chat 2021-08-16 10:25:48 WOAH, CORE FIGHTER MOMENT
creations-chat 2021-08-16 10:37:01 shouldve been supersized at the very least
creations-chat 2021-08-16 11:19:57 I can see why they think its a bit wide, but it looks alright imo, not everything has to be 100% proportional to look good
creations-chat 2021-08-16 11:22:48 I think you did great blending it all together, personally
creations-chat 2021-08-16 11:32:03 Looks badass, i personally like vibrant colors myself too, no need to adjust to what the majority thinks!
creations-chat 2021-08-16 11:34:15 I also like it, have fun with it
creations-chat 2021-08-16 11:39:10 no, because at the end of the day its not a truck

ill add that tank destroyers have an open back too and they arent considered pickup trucks
creations-chat 2021-08-16 11:41:20 ehh, light can be a bit of a stretch considering things like the GMC Topkick exist but yeah compared to tanks
creations-chat 2021-08-16 11:46:52 might wanna mess around with triangle wedges and triangle wedgeblocks
creations-chat 2021-08-16 11:58:02 Disguise it as a ship departing from the main one?
creations-chat 2021-08-16 13:48:27 I feel like I need to ask this, because of what I'm planning to build;
What do you guys think is the best way to tension tank tracks, while keeping it compact?
creations-chat 2021-08-16 13:50:33 ***that pains me, but I guess I may have to try***
Any possible alternatives, though?
the-dump 2021-08-16 13:51:09 
creations-chat 2021-08-16 14:56:26 na, it's exactly what makes it so nice
creations-chat 2021-08-16 14:59:14 Did no corner wedges work?
creations-chat 2021-08-16 15:11:12 ..Wait, I just realized he has round corner wedges.

**H o w?**   I can't find them anywhere.
creations-chat 2021-08-16 17:54:05 its not THAT jarring cmon man
creations-chat 2021-08-16 18:02:44 Set the Red in your RGB to any given number, G and B you distribute to a lesser extent in order to lighten, darken or change shades of your red
the-dump 2021-08-16 18:11:00 im pretty sure thats still warnable
the-dump 2021-08-16 18:11:33 its 100% warnable man
the-dump 2021-08-16 18:11:44 h
the-dump 2021-08-16 18:12:12 Possibly
creations-chat 2021-08-16 18:13:48 Ehh it's fine, I don't (blank)lock, nor do I wanna. I prefer playing vanilla

creations-chat 2021-08-16 20:03:35 Try maybe a dark blue color, with yellow highlights?
creations-chat 2021-08-16 20:34:10 yeah sure, i dont see why not
though, i would also include images of the engines in flight position
creations-chat 2021-08-17 06:14:29 dear god i lost any hope that people can motivate newbies to get better in here after reading whats up there
creations-chat 2021-08-17 07:29:01 I hope this is an ironic post.

creations-chat 2021-08-17 08:40:07 i liked the old one better personally, but it does look good
the-dump 2021-08-17 08:41:23 oh?

the-dump 2021-08-17 08:45:35 the meme i got before people started making jokes about computers burning down from playing gta 5 in 4k
the-dump 2021-08-17 08:49:14 damn
the-dump 2021-08-17 08:49:49 either thats a low end pc or or my xbox one s is a tank
the-dump 2021-08-17 08:50:03 ah
the-dump 2021-08-17 09:03:35 
creations-chat 2021-08-17 09:05:57 Hey, can I have the name of this plane? I quite like it's aesthetic.
creations-chat 2021-08-17 09:08:01 This?
creations-chat 2021-08-17 09:10:02 I'm just making sure, my knowledge about jets isn't good.
creations-chat 2021-08-17 09:17:21 He fixed them
creations-chat 2021-08-17 09:20:01 its just to give an example of the camo
creations-chat 2021-08-17 10:57:40 man that beam effect is so cool tho
creations-chat 2021-08-17 11:00:04 I'm not sure about the accuracy, as I'm not too familiar with the specifics of this crossover goji HOWEVER it so far looks amazing. Could you perhaps tell me how you achieved the effect? I think it'd look cool for beam rifles in gundam builds too, so I'd love to incorporate something similar.
creations-chat 2021-08-17 11:02:35 Understood, thank you. Do I need to motorlock any more into one another to make it as smooth as that too or is it not necessary?
creations-chat 2021-08-17 11:15:49 speak of the devil
creations-chat 2021-08-17 11:25:33 thank you, I was hoping someone would make this
creations-chat 2021-08-17 11:28:01 worth every single one
creations-chat 2021-08-17 11:59:28 I think it's because it's space occupance is as high as it could possibly be, and the person building it didn't know how to fold?
creations-chat 2021-08-17 12:01:36 With that much space? Yeah, pretty much.
Though, it's still not THAT much of a half sphere, more of a flat cone.
creations-chat 2021-08-17 12:22:40 Hey that's pretty nice.
creations-chat 2021-08-17 13:42:21 
creations-chat 2021-08-17 13:46:44 either way the funi "hair" is missing
the-dump 2021-08-17 14:15:36 <@273536574770380800>
the-dump 2021-08-17 14:18:44 Its not really Half Life 3 though.
the-dump 2021-08-17 14:18:52 Its more of Half Life 2.5
the-dump 2021-08-17 14:19:14 Because it doesn't pick up after 2, it retcons its ending
the-dump 2021-08-17 14:19:23 Unless you aren't talking about alyx
the-dump 2021-08-17 14:19:35 And i indeed missed something
the-dump 2021-08-17 14:19:46 yeah then its more or less a prequel and a retcon
the-dump 2021-08-17 14:20:21 Technically speaking yes it is half life 3
the-dump 2021-08-17 14:20:32 but franchise wise not really
the-dump 2021-08-17 14:21:23 Dlc dont count
the-dump 2021-08-17 14:21:28 Theyre addons
the-dump 2021-08-17 14:21:34 FOR a game
the-dump 2021-08-17 14:21:42 If they did, you could run them without the base game
the-dump 2021-08-17 14:21:54 hhhhh
the-dump 2021-08-17 14:31:37 h
creations-chat 2021-08-17 14:46:30 Chill, if nobody talking anything then it most likely means the build doesn't have any real flaws. Granted, I suppose we should have gave our thoughts sooner, that's true.
creations-chat 2021-08-17 14:56:18 People find them annoying, as there's not much you can do against them without a fast and nimble vehicle

But I say sure, if you wanna
creations-chat 2021-08-17 14:59:34 i mean they really are easy to destroy if you have the required vehicle to put it on, it could be a very fast terrain vehicle or a jet
creations-chat 2021-08-17 15:51:47 sheesh thats a whole lot of bomb
creations-chat 2021-08-17 18:36:53 bruh? its a rule he should point out when it broke
creations-chat 2021-08-17 18:45:01 Except, people do? The mods enforce it, handing out warnings for it.
creations-chat 2021-08-17 18:47:50 Hell, today people have been warned for it.
the-dump 2021-08-17 19:11:49 hey guess what
the-dump 2021-08-17 19:12:31 DEAR GOD, WHAT HAVE THEY DONE TO YOU

the-dump 2021-08-18 10:01:50 cloud cutter
the-dump 2021-08-18 10:35:57 hnn
the-dump 2021-08-18 10:36:03 okay i have only one suggestion when choosing a new pfp
the-dump 2021-08-18 10:36:08 try to be less stereotypical about it
the-dump 2021-08-18 10:36:14 i see so many people who like russian, german or whatever stuff
the-dump 2021-08-18 10:36:19 but then their pfp's are all the same jokes
the-dump 2021-08-18 10:36:24 its stale by now, very stale
the-dump 2021-08-18 10:36:33 of course i dont judge if you like it
the-dump 2021-08-18 12:16:21 this right here officer
creations-chat 2021-08-18 17:10:49 Ye
creations-chat 2021-08-19 08:08:50 As the name suggests, these are my first tank tracks! I would love to hear feedback and improvement suggestions.
https://streamable.com/5a4rzz
creations-chat 2021-08-19 08:11:02 Quick side note: I made these in preparation for.. Something quite big.
creations-chat 2021-08-19 08:13:23 You wish.
creations-chat 2021-08-19 08:31:27 damn didnt even notice that
creations-chat 2021-08-19 08:40:23 Funi plane, what's it called?
creations-chat 2021-08-19 08:42:29 wonderful, thank you
creations-chat 2021-08-19 08:48:17 I mean, it's cool but a little gappy
creations-chat 2021-08-19 19:28:24 very smol, the propellers kinda distract though
creations-chat 2021-08-21 10:19:20 thats a decent amount of thrust
creations-chat 2021-08-21 11:19:37 'Cause not everything has to be 100% accurate to be good?
creations-chat 2021-08-21 11:24:01 I'm sure PC will remain active even once the sequel releases
creations-chat 2021-08-21 15:23:36 You will need to fold
creations-chat 2021-08-21 15:49:34 No, weapons won't fix it.
I believe you could however improve it by rounding out the wings, try triangle wedges 1x2 in place of the side 1x2 wedges.
(side note: if they're supposed to be rectangular I'm sorry, I don't know much about planes.)
creations-chat 2021-08-21 15:51:36 You're right, but this specific plane is based on real life. A custom "what if" could be made, but it doesn't seem to be the intention of the builder.
creations-chat 2021-08-21 15:54:01 Okay, calm down, remember the "extensive swearing" rule. It's just  someone who likes weapons, I guess
creations-chat 2021-08-21 15:59:25 PVP is a rather big part of Plane Crazy nowadays, let's be honest, but the main fun always was, and still is the technical element behind the whole game. It's the main entertainment point for many. Will, if you like the PVP most and freedom of making any doomsday machine you like, that's cool but please remember that unfortunately most people here are for the engineering side of things, not weapons.
creations-chat 2021-08-21 16:02:19 It's his schtick, completely fine to do that! I don't mind if that's what they end up being, as long as they do their purpose well. The only issue is, people tend to get mad at him for his lack of understanding that people don't really like putting guns on their creations if they're not meant to be PVP oriented. Usually, people outright state of their builds are for PVP, if they don't they most likely aren't and is the reason behind a lack of weapons. It's kind of an issue for both sides how it currently is handled..
creations-chat 2021-08-21 16:05:28 I suppose with how people use Motorlock, it's true.. Most people do like looks here.
I personally like to make my creations function though, which is why I like mechs so much. They work, while looking cool. A perfect 50/50, and with the surface area available a lot of features can be implemented (even if I'm re-creating something initially)
creations-chat 2021-08-21 16:08:49 True, I ain't got nothing to say about that. However I admit to also being a fan of builds that do their job and nothing more, looks aren't everything is what I'm pointin' to I guess?
creations-chat 2021-08-22 09:01:12 h
creations-chat 2021-08-22 09:03:40 What on earth is going on here?
creations-chat 2021-08-22 09:05:42 I did these kind of randomly generated sentences before with my phone too, y'know.
..What about Wit?
I mean what about Wit, why is he bein' questioned, constantly mentioned.
creations-chat 2021-08-22 09:08:47 Yes, he did. And I have 0 clue why other than y'all suddenly jumping onto him for some reason.

the-dump 2021-08-23 12:10:20 things are much unfunnier
creations-chat 2021-08-23 20:09:19 Why do people downvote that one, exactly? I think it looks REALLY cool.
creations-chat 2021-08-23 20:29:16 Doesn't look like asking for downvotes to me, and this is what they said when first sending the very first image.
Yes they're a bit on the nose with said "smelling downvotes", but again: it's not asking for them.
creations-chat 2021-08-23 20:32:57 Sure.
creations-chat 2021-08-23 20:37:11 honestly i find that specific build funny
