creations-chat 2020-10-26 23:56:16 thx, i want to make a larger ship someday.
creations-chat 2020-10-26 23:59:02 damn
creations-chat 2020-10-27 00:00:04 to everyone that's unliked the ship, what's wrong with it?
creations-chat 2020-10-27 00:01:06 Ah, ill probably refine the hull later.
creations-chat 2020-10-27 00:02:44 no it wasn't you silly goose
creations-chat 2020-10-27 00:14:02 spicy
creations-chat 2020-10-27 21:47:07 hey fonne, have you made the maus?

creations-chat 2020-10-30 13:41:52 ive been working on my new ship for like 9 hours so far

creations-chat 2020-11-15 10:35:52 <:Pinged:508027985190715457>
creations-chat 2020-11-18 03:59:28 Hey <@!456137975894507521> , what's wrong with the aircraft?
creations-chat 2020-11-18 04:00:59 As well as everyone else who has downvoted it, what's wrong with it?
creations-chat 2020-11-18 04:02:42 the plane was blocky irl VVVVV thanks, I dont have a set scale per block, and I intend on more detail in the future when I can get it
creations-chat 2020-11-18 04:04:39 
creations-chat 2020-11-18 04:06:12 yea, i thought i made the fuselage too long. I have no set scale for builds, I need one though, thanks for the tips
creations-chat 2020-11-18 04:07:44 OH. I misread the comment above, it said tail wing not fuselage. VVVVV and yes, the back angle is too much. (what are vent wings?)
creations-chat 2020-11-18 04:09:50 I reversed engineerd planes Ive seen from a while back, and this is literally my second plane. I have bad experience with normal wing panels because my first planes from a long time ago were realistic wings but their roll rate was horrible. (thanks though, notes taken, Ill modify the design) (** I have bad experiences with using the keyboard to control planes in this game**)
creations-chat 2020-11-18 04:11:45 yea
creations-chat 2020-11-18 04:19:02 i made a mil v-12, but people didn't like it because it's low detail
creations-chat 2020-11-18 04:26:26 also, is the fuselage too tall on the zeppelin staaken?
creations-chat 2020-11-18 04:33:05 > this doesn't look as blocky, plus the tail wing on yours is longer and smaller than what it should be, especially the nose having a wedge at the ends of the nose
<@!614659754249420810> Context on "smaller than it should be"?
creations-chat 2020-11-27 06:03:17 I did. sorry. what's wrong with the bomber? (and you too slayer?)
creations-chat 2020-11-27 06:05:30 I do know how to make custom control surfaces, but they're difficult for me to operate so i prefer vent wings for maneuverability
creations-chat 2020-11-27 06:08:30 Just appreciate it for it's damn survivability (it's missing its tail, half of its right wing is clipped and its bottom of torn up.)
creations-chat 2020-11-27 06:12:08 cool

creations-chat 2020-11-27 06:37:08 <@!614659754249420810> thank you for not liking the dumbest fucking thing ive ever made. I am truly grateful
creations-chat 2020-11-27 06:38:54 Right? No one should have liked that dumb thing. I personally hate everyone who liked it and hope they die a horrible death
creations-chat 2020-11-27 06:41:04 the vertical stabilizer is a little short length wise imo
creations-chat 2020-11-28 02:38:07 <@!693859644493266954>  what's wrong with it?

creations-chat 2020-12-14 23:43:00 Can I get some criticism on my build? If you downvote a build but don't say why, it's pointless to downvote. I find it extraordinarily stupid of people to downvote a build but not give a reason why.
creations-chat 2020-12-14 23:51:16 <@!551806781609869313> that's the problem. No one gives a damn opinion when they downvote, that's what get's me. (and to theloud, i meant on the bow, trying the wedgework)

VV then they should say why so it can be improved. This channel is for that purpose but no one uses it when they downvote something.
creations-chat 2020-12-14 23:53:57 so, you're not liking something, and you give no reason why. sounds dumb.
creations-chat 2020-12-14 23:55:59 yea box, i was wondering what was wrong with the shieldhall i built
creations-chat 2020-12-14 23:58:16 Ok, fair enough. it's a downsized ship too, so i didn't have room for detail. lack of plans too. I can get a draft view though.
creations-chat 2020-12-15 00:03:01 hey, dood, imma get you a draft photo

creations-chat 2021-01-24 12:32:09 also, what did you mean by walkway, james?
creations-chat 2021-01-24 12:35:01 AH! I see now. My carrier was designed for aerodynamics and hydrodynamics. I would have to change the entire hull (and redo the camo which took like 10 hours which i've been doing all night)
creations-chat 2021-01-24 12:40:36 ooh, nice
