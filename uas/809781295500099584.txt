creations-chat 2022-04-02 05:23:36 Joke? In the photo?
creations-chat 2022-04-02 05:25:38 Bruh, will it kill?
creations-chat 2022-04-02 11:47:22 Cause it is simple, effective but still looks good. It also require some 
little more skill to hide the exposed motorlock.
creations-chat 2022-04-02 11:49:42 2-3 blocks wide plane is quite bulky and not effective at pvp
creations-chat 2022-04-02 11:52:32 Yep

Yeah i admit

creations-chat 2023-04-30 02:56:59 <@912065912658608190> yo that was a cool mig. I have some suggestions that can improve your fulcrum. As you can see, the wings are inaccurate, you can fix that by replacing 1x2 with 1x1 deltas. Do the same thing with the elevators too. The rudders are smaller than they are supposed to be. You can improve the lerx using half triangle wedges and ladders/ control surfaces
