creations-chat 2021-09-02 20:50:09 it pulls back further than normal motor locking
so far in fact that it can pull the sides past each other
Ive yet to find a use for it but if even one person does then im glad i posted it
creations-chat 2021-09-02 20:56:15 i wouldnt consider myself low tier. I can show you some much better creations if you want. This was just a random thing i stumbled into and wanted to make publicly known in case anyone finds a use for it.
