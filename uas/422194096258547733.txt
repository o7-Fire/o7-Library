help 2021-08-24 19:57:55 might've gone overboard on motorlock, too

help 2021-08-24 20:07:01 Probably something with how I can't seem to get my engines place well enough to keep it stable whilst flying. It still loses control despite all the wings I added.
help 2021-08-24 20:07:18 for now I might try and get lucky with engine placement

help 2021-08-24 22:21:48 Good luck to him cause its gonna take ages for him to get that thing to fly if he has no controls
