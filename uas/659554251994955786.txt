creations-chat 2021-11-19 02:31:10 <@456226577798135808>  pretty drippy
creations-chat 2021-11-21 05:14:08 <@456226577798135808> that thing is amazing
creations-chat 2022-01-05 23:57:03 no, do a desert paintjob
creations-chat 2022-01-06 01:19:01 A bit too vivid, try making the numbers on the color code thing more similar, for example if it was 90,80,70 make it 88,80,72
creations-chat 2022-01-09 21:32:42 nah thats the F-2 apparition ðŸ’€
creations-chat 2022-01-11 20:32:56 <@!843374289876680725> Sci-fi*

creations-chat 2022-01-11 20:57:18 I spent more than 10 on a WW1 biplane, so 3 isn't that long, especially for something that big.
its not even finished yet, still missing gear.
creations-chat 2022-01-11 21:00:29 its also kinda hard to say its really cool when <@!605122774155002103>  posted their arctic explorer thing right before you
creations-chat 2022-01-11 21:02:43 No hate tho
help 2022-03-08 02:08:18 can someone help me understand camera locking? I wanna make several custom angles for the tail of a small plane, but I'm stuck. Yes, I've seen the tutorial on YouTube, but I think a demo in-game would be really helpful. If anyone is willing to help DM me.
creations-chat 2022-09-11 06:48:41 I'm about to paint it, dunno why I posted it before I did lmao
creations-chat 2022-09-11 16:08:09 Yep
