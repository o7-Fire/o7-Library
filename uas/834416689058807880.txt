creations-chat 2022-12-20 23:00:01 i highly recommend you to not use 1x4 wedge for the tail, i suggest you to do cameralock
creations-chat 2022-12-20 23:02:06 you just stack 1x2 half down wedges lol its still the same as 1x4 wedge

anyways just improve the tail shape and im sure people will like your biplane
