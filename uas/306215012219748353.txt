creations-chat 2022-12-22 09:00:08 nose looks way too pointy and jagged imo
creations-chat 2022-12-22 11:15:04 what i meant is that it manages to actually spin inside the tiny space its been given
creations-chat 2022-12-22 11:17:50 im still learning to mag lock so maybe in the future i will

and it is, but with the circlelocking, theres very little space for the locking assembly of the prop
creations-chat 2022-12-22 11:20:28 the difference between you and i is that you are smart and i am not lol
creations-chat 2022-12-22 11:26:00 +it also spins up slowly over time like an actual motor (this all sounds very normal but if you actually saw the locking you'd understand)
creations-chat 2022-12-22 11:31:23 top section could be quite the bit smoother, and the colour is bland across the entire thing, try and add some spice with different shades and materials
creations-chat 2022-12-22 11:41:48 even still, wouldnt hurt to use darker shades to highlight certain aspects such as control surfaces, wood material for struts etc.
creations-chat 2022-12-22 11:44:04 theres plenty of misssed detail, the support struts that hold the panels together can be highlighted

creations-chat 2023-07-13 07:44:29 cause idgaf abt your opinions :)
creations-chat 2023-07-13 07:50:18 1. the landing gear isnt for show and is actually functional, they're not bricks, you're just blind
2. angling the wings causes all sorts of problems that id rather not deal with
3. im not going to win the contest regardless, this is mainly for fun
creations-chat 2023-07-13 07:55:44 yes i could, but it would be less accurate
creations-chat 2023-07-13 07:58:04 i dont care
creations-chat 2023-07-13 08:00:21 when im actually working on the plane then maybe ill care, but rn im tryna play forza
creations-chat 2023-07-13 08:09:12 happy?

note: pointing out things and shitting on it isnt constructive criticism and i am infact autistic
creations-chat 2023-07-13 08:13:44 what is that supposed to mean.
creations-chat 2023-07-13 08:17:10 thats nice
creations-chat 2023-07-13 08:19:24 no, keep yer opinions to yourself
creations-chat 2023-07-13 08:21:32 fun fact: insults arent a good form of feedback, ergo ignored
creations-chat 2023-07-13 08:24:21 it really isnt, and y'all are so vague with your "feedback" its impossible to improve: "HiDe ThE lOcK" mate show me how
creations-chat 2023-07-13 08:27:52 thats much more helpful, thankyou

im running out of room so im not sure where i could place another tower
creations-chat 2023-07-13 08:32:38 -ill try and find a workaround for that, cause motors are buggy n i dont wanna use them to angle the wings
-trying to fix that as we speak
-im not sure what to do about this as a custom fan would take up too much room
-the suspension is needed to retract into the gear well
-too small? too big?
-not sure about improving this either
-the l-1011's wings are quite shiny and i thought foil was best for that
-will do later
creations-chat 2023-07-13 08:37:36 i could try using ice, its basically the same as plastic but also decently shiny
and im quite stuck on the nose
creations-chat 2023-07-13 08:43:27 yeah ill try and rebuild it in a seperate slot a bit later, when i did this one i started with the glass shape and i assume that was a mistake
creations-chat 2023-07-13 08:48:10 thankyou for the very useful feedback, means alot to hear it for once
creations-chat 2023-07-13 11:26:45 ..that was 3 hours ago
creations-chat 2023-07-13 11:30:06 just started tryna redesign, as opposed to half of it being motorlocked down, the entire cockpit is now motorlocked onto the body
creations-chat 2023-07-13 11:32:45 yeah thats apparent already mate
creations-chat 2023-07-13 11:48:36 ok
creations-chat 2023-07-17 12:41:28 getting there, still gotta fix the nose..
