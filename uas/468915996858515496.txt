help 2020-11-22 12:52:53 <@!760100554646224937> Whats wrong with your plane
help 2020-11-22 12:53:20 Do you have a image
help 2020-11-22 12:53:50 oh my
help 2020-11-22 12:54:01 Very chonky
help 2020-11-22 12:54:09 It might be weight problems
help 2020-11-22 12:54:22 and the fact that you have no elevators
help 2020-11-22 12:54:43 The horizontal wings on the back of the plane
help 2020-11-22 12:55:03 Those elevate your plane hence the name elevators
help 2020-11-22 12:55:29 A simple look at the tutorial starter plane you get when you join
help 2020-11-22 12:55:36 it shows what you need
help 2020-11-22 12:55:48 Another thing is the center
help 2020-11-22 12:56:10 Your orange line is suppose to be as close as possible to the blue line
help 2020-11-22 12:56:42 If it isnt centered then you can expect the plane to fly leaing in one direction
help 2020-11-22 12:56:59 Just like the band one direction, its leaning in to a garbage bin
help 2020-11-22 12:58:19 You can use ballast or helium blocks to counter the difference
help 2020-11-22 12:58:56 Now I need help myself
help 2020-11-22 12:59:06 Is anyone here a vtol specialist whatever thing
help 2020-11-22 12:59:11 A helicopter

help 2020-11-22 13:00:56 I use the usual coaxial rotor with 4 blades on each motor
help 2020-11-22 13:01:12 The center of gravity on the helicopter is right where I want it
help 2020-11-22 13:01:31 Same way you turn anything on? With the keybind M
help 2020-11-22 13:01:50 You click it once

help 2020-11-22 13:03:33 I watched that <@!510454338532016139> He taught be some stuff but he reccomends the coaxial rather than non-coaxial. Im for the looks of the helicopter not the stability
help 2020-11-22 13:04:05 I could try using coaxial rotor but its gonna look weird on a small ass heli
help 2020-11-22 13:04:44 You have this 2 block tall 8 block wide blades extending from a helicopter about 10 blocks wide
help 2020-11-22 13:05:12 Looks like you attached a mega head on to a 3 year old
