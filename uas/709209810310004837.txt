If you don't have one add treads but really only ways are motorlocking them in or placing details manually with some signs 1x1. Also remove it from <#384025409945337856> because you are posting a part W.I.P and asking for help in a channel where it should be finished

creations-chat 2022-01-07 22:19:47 bro, don't even reply to me if all you're going to give me is some shit that isn't even useful, and besides, paint isn't always accurate, you realize how hard it is to paint an apache where all the parts of the heli isn't even on one spot
creations-chat 2022-01-07 22:26:26 all i asked was to how to make it better like tell me what blocks to use to make it more accurate, not give me some reference pictures and tell me to figure it out, and bro, this has more motorlock than actual blocks itself
creations-chat 2022-01-07 22:28:55 btw, editing then trying to ping me in that edit isn't going to ping me anyway
