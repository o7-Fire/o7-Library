creations-chat 2021-06-27 01:29:25 what build? nvm im dumb
creations-chat 2021-06-27 01:32:19 joshua speaking of it, why did you downvote our build?
creations-chat 2021-06-27 01:34:55 it wasnt meant to be pretty, but meant to be a unique coop build, we couldnt exactly build well when we would colide eachother
creations-chat 2021-06-27 01:37:05 to add to it, we probably would never get this chance again, so we rushed to make something unique instead of putting a ton of time into looks - if server closed we would never be able to build it again
creations-chat 2021-06-27 01:39:56 What if someone would join and make a server crasher?
creations-chat 2021-06-27 01:42:00 Well my friend joined me and his plot glitched then i rejoined and boom same plot. We probably wont get to do this again
creations-chat 2021-06-27 01:48:20 If ur lucky, sometimes u get a broken plot that 2 people can use

the-dump 2022-12-14 22:49:25 ive been making an ai chat bot and i came across this gem
creations-chat 2022-12-14 22:53:30 You could try some dark dark gray and some orange and purple
bug-reports 2022-12-18 07:05:10 fr, stop using some free stupid server that will crash every 5 minutes to host the bot on, just buy a 24/h host for 5 dollars
creations-chat 2022-12-19 21:33:59 is this length good for my custom carrier? (Length not the shape) 300 blocks
creations-chat 2022-12-19 21:39:27 i got 0 blocksspace to make a proper hull

(Single account build)

No dumb, then it cant move properly
creations-chat 2022-12-19 21:56:06 shut up, i was asking if the length was good anyway, not anything about the hull - your input isnt needed

then dont bother answering? also nice typo
