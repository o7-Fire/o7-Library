bug-reports 2018-12-16 17:22:29 on my client it is getting launched out of the barrel
bug-reports 2018-12-16 17:22:37 but the server is telling it that it isnt
bug-reports 2018-12-16 17:22:46 so it gets teleported back repeatedly
bug-reports 2018-12-16 17:22:58 then it just freezes at the end
bug-reports 2018-12-16 17:23:10 hard to make guns like this when that happens
bug-reports 2018-12-16 17:25:55 the barrel is made of 0.9 blocks
bug-reports 2018-12-16 17:26:03 and I even tried it with cylinders
bug-reports 2018-12-16 17:33:20 it rarely works depending on the server
