the-dump 2022-06-26 13:42:07 gosh im SO GLAD
the-dump 2022-06-26 13:42:10 thanks again
the-dump 2022-06-26 13:42:21 can I get you anything for you superb detective skills
the-dump 2022-06-26 13:43:15 also: the numbers dont represent parts of me u moron
the-dump 2022-06-26 13:43:24 it represents how much of each value
the-dump 2022-06-26 13:43:51 yebo
the-dump 2022-06-26 13:45:33 <@714878625484243101>  its how much of each value , like 0% funni means I am not funni, and 100% funni means I am very funny lmao
the-dump 2022-06-26 13:46:09 and u call me dumb
the-dump 2022-06-26 13:46:23 like 0% everything means no personality
the-dump 2022-06-26 13:46:37 100% everything means I do everything fully
the-dump 2022-06-26 13:47:13 i guess that would be ur, more than what you possibly can be
the-dump 2022-06-26 13:47:29 like 169% funni means u are so funny u are over the limit of funniness
the-dump 2022-06-26 13:47:35 makes 101% sence yes
the-dump 2022-06-26 13:48:10 no
the-dump 2022-06-26 13:48:24 can you have 101% of something
the-dump 2022-06-26 13:48:31 yea
the-dump 2022-06-26 13:48:50 exactly
the-dump 2022-06-26 13:48:57 aand, nothing is above 100 soo
the-dump 2022-06-26 13:50:17 ok no u dont grasp
the-dump 2022-06-26 13:50:30 lets put it this way
the-dump 2022-06-26 13:50:57 just thinking of good example
the-dump 2022-06-26 13:51:38 LIFE SKILLS TO ACHIEVE

1. Get good at (whatever): 90% out of 100%
2. Do this: 99% out of 100%
3. Do that: 25% out of 100%
the-dump 2022-06-26 13:52:10 like that
the-dump 2022-06-26 13:52:36 but yea i guess that could be clearer
the-dump 2022-06-26 13:53:03 ***._.***
the-dump 2022-06-26 13:53:06 each value
the-dump 2022-06-26 13:53:13 counts out of 100%
the-dump 2022-06-26 13:53:15 they dont
the-dump 2022-06-26 13:53:17 add to anything
the-dump 2022-06-26 13:53:56 i am 99% done with this task and 20% done with this one
the-dump 2022-06-26 13:53:59 ur logic is like
the-dump 2022-06-26 13:54:46 if I am 99% done with something, and 20% done with something else, does that mean, i am 119% done with both of them
the-dump 2022-06-26 13:54:51 cus thats ur logic rn
the-dump 2022-06-26 13:55:11 each value is its own
the-dump 2022-06-26 13:55:13 they dont add
the-dump 2022-06-26 13:55:28 yea
the-dump 2022-06-26 13:55:31 they are man
the-dump 2022-06-26 13:55:32 nope
the-dump 2022-06-26 13:55:36 its a struct

the-dump 2022-06-26 13:55:57 valuer
the-dump 2022-06-26 13:56:12 they are their ***own*** values
the-dump 2022-06-26 13:56:21 those values cant go over 100%
the-dump 2022-06-26 13:56:38 are u being this dumb on purpouse

the-dump 2022-06-26 14:01:33 2 + 1 = ?

help 2023-03-02 17:24:23 Hi guys, I have this simple 4 leg walker setup like this: The 2 motors are both set to 0.25 speed and max torque, and all 4 pistons are set to 2.4, but it seems highly unstable. I have attached a video to explain the problem more. It wobbles a lot and I don't really see why
