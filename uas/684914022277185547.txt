creations-chat 2021-06-09 21:14:23 It was pure honesty, but a bit harsh-

A jet with wings long as that is a unrealistic imo

creations-chat 2021-07-02 15:39:02 I would actually upvote if it would be a sword in a creeperâ€™s head. Other than that, i deem it as low effort

creations-chat 2021-09-01 00:55:49 -Delta wings would be useful
-The other glass type is better
-The fold is useless
-Landing gears would be cool

creations-chat 2021-09-30 03:25:06 Oddly familiarâ€¦ it seems to resemble the tik tok fanartâ€¦
creations-chat 2021-09-30 03:39:35 I see two wings. No holes
creations-chat 2021-10-13 00:00:24 nah itâ€™s not a 3d model, itâ€™s pretty obvious that itâ€™s blocks and text. Ok
creations-chat 2021-10-13 01:40:40 I still donâ€™t understand how that got into hof, thereâ€™s a huge gap between this build and the other recent hof builds
creations-chat 2021-10-13 01:50:14 Cool, try to make a car with it <:FineTroll:626841259746656289>
creations-chat 2021-10-14 23:45:14 Which wing looks better? The 1st and 2nd ones or the 3rd one?

creations-chat 2021-10-24 15:13:43 <@!685574188719013905> make the lines on the cockpit the same color as the body. The legs of the helicopter are too straight, they could use some cruves.
creations-chat 2021-10-24 15:16:54 Maybe make the door 1st, and make the shape of the tail around it
creations-chat 2021-10-24 15:49:34 A logo on the sides, random lines, random emojis and textures. You should look at halo ships.
