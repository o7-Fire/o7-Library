bug-reports 2021-12-30 21:00:56 When adding a motor2 to a build that contains trapdoors, the trapdoors glitch out - The owner of the build is no longer able to open it by clicking on it, when other people click the trapdoor, it doesn't open on their screen but it does on the build owner's screen, when the build owner opens the trapdoors with a keybind, it doesn't open on other people's screens.

creations-chat 2022-04-24 18:36:32 is that square sticking out from the nose supposed to be there
creations-chat 2022-04-24 18:40:33 If you don't plan to make a big interior for the Blackhawk i think you can probably try to move that motor back a half block or so to hide it
creations-chat 2022-04-24 18:42:20 You can probably extend the smooth sides of the nose a block back as well but idk
