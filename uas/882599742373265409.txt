bot-central 2022-01-16 12:21:05 &suggest Map expansion because this map is too small and revamp blocks such as lights and motors. Why are lights just blocks like bruh. And add a scale tool/circle 7x7, 10x10, etc sizes. Oh yeah and please fix motor2 and make it have a LOCK function like motor. It is not good to launch a build to have your motor2 have 2 torque. And the changelog has also not been updated since the summer update. the conclusion: fix motor2 having 2 torque when launch and add bigger part sizes. and also add a feature that allows you to resize the node of some blocks.
