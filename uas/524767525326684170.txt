creations-chat 2022-03-10 22:20:05 <@!696816232325709824> eh, build looks pretty mid ngl, still good tho, I think the barrel gets too thin for an AA gun, assuming you were going for a 20mm
creations-chat 2022-03-10 22:22:30 I feel like it would be better if you just replaced it with more pvp guns, would give the effect a 20mm has on a plane

Also the base could be improved

creations-chat 2022-03-14 03:32:03 any feedback? (fictional drone)
creations-chat 2022-03-14 03:35:50 yeah i was thinking gear was a little long,

<@!595298908574449688>  alright, will do
creations-chat 2022-03-14 03:39:17 Mix of a few drones, MQ-9, MQ-1, etc.
