help 2021-10-15 00:39:40 who can help me with my ornithopter
help 2021-10-15 00:40:01 i have tried but if the wings are too large then motors go out of sync and it wobbles like crazy
help 2021-10-17 11:29:21 This isn't generating lift. it's 16 super rockets angled upwards spinning around
help 2021-10-17 11:29:35 It only generates lift when the rockets are facing directly upwards
help 2021-10-17 11:29:55 Also the rockets are stretching the motor lol
help 2021-10-17 11:34:22 There are no wing panels
help 2021-10-17 11:34:28 
help 2021-10-17 11:34:33 Reference images to what I am building
help 2021-10-17 11:35:46 I forgor wat areofoil mean
help 2021-10-17 11:42:42 There. Are. No. Wing. Or. Aerodynamic. Parts. On. The. Props.
help 2021-10-17 12:02:22 I don't mean I'm gonna do the suspension glitches
help 2021-10-17 12:02:25 I just want the prop
help 2021-10-17 12:48:56 No but I mean when I tilt the props upwards it dosent generate any lift like there is 0 lift
help 2021-10-17 12:50:15 Why does that happen?
help 2021-10-17 23:43:53 the motors are unpowered the rockets are whats pushing it so when the rockets are tilted up there should be an amount of thrust upwards so the more i tilt the rockets upwards the more the rockets should generate lift
help 2021-10-18 05:25:48 it is possible to make a vehicle using only rockets thats what im trying to do
help 2021-10-18 05:25:51 sigh
bot-central 2021-10-22 02:38:32 ree
help 2021-10-26 23:49:48 does anyone have a design for a thrusther to always point upwards
help 2021-10-26 23:49:55 i forgot its name
help 2021-10-26 23:51:14 like uhh you put the thrusther in the middle / engine and then it always stabilises it to go upwards
help 2021-10-26 23:59:28 so its like firstly you make a gyroscope and then you put a thrusther in it and it always points it upwardrs thus providing upwards lift
help 2021-10-27 00:02:03 something like that wait lemme draw a diagram
help 2021-10-27 00:02:30 im not sure watcha talking about lol
help 2021-10-27 00:11:14 like this
help 2021-10-27 00:14:28 centre thingy is where the thrusther goes
help 2021-10-27 00:14:34 grey area is blocks
help 2021-10-27 00:14:58 that thingy that is above blocks is unpowered motors
help 2021-10-27 00:15:13 bottom right diagram is how it works
help 2021-10-27 00:15:21 but i cant get it to work that way
help 2021-10-27 00:15:24 and its rlly big
help 2021-10-27 00:21:59 yup
help 2021-10-27 00:22:11 so the thrusther stays facing upwards the entire time
help 2021-10-27 00:22:47 (bcos i want to have contrillable upwards thrust not just going up with helium and getting stuck in the air or going down rlly slowly
help 2021-10-27 00:23:15 poop

creations-chat 2022-02-20 23:52:15 <@!346438146549874688> thinner back wheels and have less torque on front wheels? not sure if it would work tho seems like the angle of the wheels and back wheels arnt good
if you want u can make a differential in the back how? dont ask me im not that advanced.
creations-chat 2022-02-20 23:55:08 (torque like the steering motors)
ah thats nice i would like to see how it works
creations-chat 2022-02-20 23:57:43 also if you actually want a almost perfect car calculate the ackerman geometry  and place a lockable differential
(im in school rn lmao i cant go into vip servers unless they unblock roblox) derp

creations-chat 2022-03-17 06:02:11 Hi koko
creations-chat 2022-03-17 06:26:36 U missed the lego momento
creations-chat 2022-04-01 06:09:39 <@654837629874864140> i would like to see a video on how it works
creations-chat 2022-04-01 06:34:58 Could you send it to me in dms
creations-chat 2022-04-02 09:06:25 So uh I made a creation
creations-chat 2022-04-02 09:08:52 The program :) feel free to just send me a dm if you are interested (it's a tank with an arm on the top its gonna have a gun soon once I get around to making one) so basically it's meant to turn into a turret when I want also I'm planning on making outriggers to stabilise the whole thing and it weighs a chonk
creations-chat 2022-04-02 09:11:55 I'm not done I gotta do the outriggers and <@882419947819638825>  right now it is an arm mounted on top of a tank base and the base is superb its overengineered thus the amount of pins used but worth it for sure its supposed to be a tank that turns into a turret
BTW lego technic is more for the mechanisms not the looks
help 2022-04-02 09:13:50 I need help designing outriggers to stabilise my creation
creations-chat 2022-04-02 09:14:14 Anyways <@404632014189494293> <@877391100137070625>
creations-chat 2022-04-02 09:16:33 That moment when you overcomplicate about everything and also this thing without the arm it can carry like twice its own weight
creations-chat 2022-04-02 09:23:54 Yep duh tank steering but it's almost impossible to use the remote and the phone at the same time so so far no video
And if u can't see there are 4 motors so direct drive and no gear friction loss and no gears grinding
help 2022-04-02 09:28:29 No the thing is that it's too unstable when in turret mode and I need a outrigger design I have large and medium motors BTW

creations-chat 2022-06-22 23:32:20 https://youtu.be/N7bJGy5QyIo
sigh ok i tried something decent it works best on flat ground and once you flip well you are screwed
creations-chat 2022-06-22 23:35:44 the magnects are there to try and keep the ball in place but they are glitchy so im gonna have to fine tune them also for some reason the motors only get the vehicle to 20 speed when W so yeah some fixing gonna have to be done
maybe next time imma put suspension
creations-chat 2022-06-22 23:42:57 are there any others?

creations-chat 2022-06-24 14:33:20 omnidirectional spherical wheels
creations-chat 2022-06-24 14:35:23 with some "adjustable" suspension it kinda works also the forward and backward motors have a boost thus the 2 motors on each wheel facing forward and the strafing capabilities are pretty decent at 30-40 speed the forward and backwards is sometimes over 50-60 and it can go on slightly bumpy terrain but sucks on hills because the spheres slip and dont work as well
still a wip probably just gonna be a prototype car if anyone wants to see the mechanism just send me a dm or ping me
creations-chat 2022-06-24 15:04:32 currently has "adjustable" suspension and a boost and tank steering and of course omnidirectional drive currently its top speed is 50-60 and it sucks at hills for obvious reasons would be nice to get some perfect callibration setting but currently im limited by the size of ball wheels of course i could put on larger cylinders but that would take forever and will glitch the ball out alot even with the magnet the mag is actually pretty good at doing its job only thing it cant do is when you flip your vehicle and click the flip button literaly even when falling the wheels stay in place sadly only has 1 block of ground clearance on the wheels but in the centre it has like 4-5 blocks all wheels have independent suspension and this is basically the most compact i can make each sphere drive
creations-chat 2022-06-24 15:06:35 pretty good but on hills its perfectly shit because of friction limitations on rough terrain tho its actually very good but i cant get it to the grey area because its so hard to drive there from the base
and yes it can go at 45 degree angles also can basically go on every single direction except upwards(actually it can if you set it to lower than 50 gravity because magnet moment)
and it can parallel park
magnet to keep it in the socket bcos theres nothing stopping it from falling out
im thinking of making a version but basically has magnets pulling the balls towards it and has hoverpads to ride across the balls
yes the magnets are kinda cheating because im tired of pistons taking forever and also the entire build basically has no motorlocking
yes <@693086613747793920> you are right
i had trouble with it falling out on cliffs LOL
creations-chat 2022-06-24 15:14:04 also this is basically the best version i have with almost no glitches 
alssooo video soon? lol
creations-chat 2022-06-24 15:16:37 https://youtu.be/N7bJGy5QyIo
this was the first version
creations-chat 2022-06-24 15:24:45 yep shit happens lol im not gonna post in creations because its just a shithole LOL
creations-chat 2022-06-24 15:29:47 also, i reccomend using spherical wheels and omnidirectional drive with a large platform as you can basically move around while not rotating and might look cool while doing it also would be rlly nice as like a sort of futuristic tank ah there are so many uses lol

Made a way of communicating with the ev3 from pu hub proportionally to accelerate/decelerate at whatever speed it needs (gonna need a bit of maths since readings from color sensor is 16-46 and I gotta get it to 0-100)
creations-chat 2023-06-29 12:12:30 Brain fried. How do I make the sensor reading (0, 16-46) into (0-100)
creations-chat 2023-06-29 12:22:48 Programming in python needs a sd card to be flashed with some software and boot time increases by like 4 minutes
creations-chat 2023-06-29 12:26:49 ? That's scratch- how the heck do u not understand it I can show it to a 4 year old and they understand it-

Anyways can help with maths how do I get the sensor reading which is 0,  16-46 into a 0-100 reading
creations-chat 2023-06-29 12:29:34 So the 16-46 reading will be 1-100
creations-chat 2023-06-29 12:31:48 Basically what I'm saying is I made a way to communicate from one device to another with proportional ( having a constant ratio to another quantity.) control
You don't need to do the math in scratch do it irl and tell me how to do it-

creations-chat 2023-07-06 02:05:50 should i widen the rear wheels?
creations-chat 2023-07-06 02:08:51 do i widen the rear?
bug-reports 2023-07-06 02:16:07 jetpack menu does not show up sometimes and you still have jetpack thus when you click jetpack button you cause 2 to overlap, too many can act kinda like parachutes and glitch you out of the map into death or something
bug-reports 2023-07-06 02:16:21 and jetpack does not hover u on the spot but constantly rises at 13 speed
creations-chat 2023-07-06 02:24:43 omg that plane has a smiley face
help 2023-07-06 02:34:59 how to stop wheels from going into ground
creations-chat 2023-07-06 03:42:51 that is adorable maybe try slowing motors down and having bigger wings for a more graceful flight
creations-chat 2023-07-06 03:45:52 err
just tailfins?
its basically a plane except the main wings are flapping so you need to have wings on your tail steering (use motors for the tail wings)
creations-chat 2023-07-06 03:53:09 im not like yall who just argue about little childish things . _. anyways 8x8 lol

creations-chat 2023-07-06 03:56:49 anyways hows my 8x8?
creations-chat 2023-07-06 03:59:07 lego technic&mindstorms ev3 - powered up 8x8 each axle has its own steering and each wheel has one motor powering it thus 12 motors total (3 motors per axle) and it uses light and color sensors set to ambient reading for proportionate acceleration the infrared sensor changes direction and mode (100% speed, -100% speed, 50% speed, -50% speed) output at 12V 153 RPM and 138.4 N/cm

creations-chat 2023-07-10 00:55:12 hmm i mean if i built it in 2021 and continue building in 2023 then did it take 2 years to build or was it built 2 years ago

creations-chat 2023-07-10 04:08:57 hows my little car? spent a bit of time on suspension
i can either go at 500 speed but slightly bumpy offroad or 300++ but smooth on road
creations-chat 2023-07-10 04:12:30 and if on smooth ground theorethically infinite speed i guess
wheels baloon out as they get faster and circumfrence increases thus the speed increases btw pure motor power, it can go past 1100 speed
creations-chat 2023-07-10 04:15:36 when do we get speed test map lol
