creations-chat 2020-04-23 17:29:11 excuse me
creations-chat 2020-04-23 17:29:14 can someone help me
help 2020-04-23 17:35:35 i dont know
help 2020-04-23 17:35:40 i think they are supposed to
help 2020-04-23 17:36:02 but with my experience and other people's experience they are just nromal seats
help 2020-04-23 17:36:12 yeah
help 2020-04-23 17:36:27 would be
help 2020-04-23 17:36:36 also i have something i need help with too
help 2020-04-23 17:38:28 so i made a shark, its a 680 piece build, so for some reason, it is way slower than shown, it shows that it's max speed is 90, but when i actually compare it to the normal robloxian swimming speed, the shark cant even outspeed a robloxian, why is this happening?
help 2020-04-23 17:40:42 wdym?
help 2020-04-23 17:55:45 why the hell is the help channel almost completely useless
help 2020-04-24 05:32:17 could someone help me with something? i made a shark, pretty big, 680 block build, so it works fine, EXCEPT that it is saying the top speed is 90, but when i compare it to normal robloxian swimming speed, it is easily outspeeded, why is this happening and what can i do about it?
help 2020-04-24 06:10:37 its not about increasing speed
help 2020-04-24 06:11:13 its about why is it showing the speed is 90 when i compare it to robloxian swimming speed and it cant outspeed that
help 2020-04-24 06:14:06 the game is basically lying about the speed of it
help 2020-04-24 06:19:42 well
help 2020-04-24 06:19:45 thing is that
help 2020-04-24 06:19:54 when i test it out not in water
help 2020-04-24 06:20:03 it still does that thing
help 2020-04-24 06:20:37 alright give me a second
help 2020-04-24 06:22:48 here is the shark
help 2020-04-24 06:24:16 it is made for water
help 2020-04-24 06:24:25 i said the exampple of going out of water
help 2020-04-24 06:24:41 becuase it doesn exactly the same thing as in water of high-balling the speed
help 2020-04-24 06:25:17 basically
help 2020-04-24 06:25:21 out of water
help 2020-04-24 06:25:36 it measures up to max speed of 400
help 2020-04-24 06:25:53 also it does sort of fly because the fins are wings
help 2020-04-24 06:26:01 when it bumps on an edge
help 2020-04-24 06:26:09 and even then
help 2020-04-24 06:26:12 it does the same thing
help 2020-04-24 06:26:18 it says it goes up to 400
help 2020-04-24 06:26:27 but from memory
help 2020-04-24 06:27:00 comparing the speed of the shark and my eurojet which goes to 300
help 2020-04-24 06:27:04 at the same altitude
help 2020-04-24 06:27:31 the eurojet goes faster at 300 while the shark goes at 400 at the same altitude and is still slower
help 2020-04-24 06:27:53 atleast of seeing the speed of how fast the ground beneath is moving
help 2020-04-24 06:29:35 its strange
help 2020-04-24 06:29:43 my theory is maybe lag
help 2020-04-24 06:29:52 because the shark does kinda hit my fps like a brick
help 2020-04-24 06:29:58 when i deploy it
help 2020-04-24 06:30:31 im gonna try using props as currently im using super rockets
help 2020-04-24 06:30:53 and then ill see how it works out
help 2020-04-24 06:31:03 not now
help 2020-04-24 06:31:25 because im getting tired of pondering what is wrong with the shark
help 2020-04-24 06:31:34 ill go play something else for now
help 2020-04-24 06:31:42 thank you for discussing with me though
help 2020-04-24 06:43:23 wait
help 2020-04-24 06:43:29 defensive
help 2020-04-24 06:43:41 what is a conveyor drive
help 2020-04-24 06:43:50 if it is a way to make my shark faster
help 2020-04-24 06:43:54 then im all for it
help 2020-04-24 06:43:59 could you explain it for me
help 2020-04-24 06:46:55 and would it interrupt other things like submerging and truning?
help 2020-04-24 06:47:12 ok
help 2020-04-24 06:47:20 should i use a tutorial?
help 2020-04-24 06:47:32 ok
help 2020-04-24 06:47:41 alright
help 2020-04-24 06:47:52 i think it should fit inside the sharks mid piece
help 2020-04-24 06:48:50 im just afraid it might make it unstable
help 2020-04-24 06:50:55 ok
help 2020-04-24 06:51:00 thank you for the advice
help 2020-04-24 06:54:08 uuh
help 2020-04-24 06:54:24 i found a good conveyor drive tutorial
help 2020-04-24 06:54:34 but the mid piece is asymetrical
help 2020-04-24 06:55:11 does it matter if it is?
help 2020-04-24 07:07:51 <@!162156549978980352>  thank you so much, the conveyor drive works wonders
