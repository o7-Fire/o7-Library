creations-chat 2020-04-02 19:14:53 Snake tank
creations-chat 2020-04-02 19:15:17 SNAKE TANK NOOOOO!
creations-chat 2020-04-04 23:58:18 The antlion after ripping apart a tank and its pilot
creations-chat 2020-04-04 23:58:44 It has teeth on the long white part on the front
creations-chat 2020-04-04 23:59:01 It opens up and can cut through boats and cars
creations-chat 2020-04-05 05:48:13 The antlion, it's a fast land and sea vehicle for attacking wheels and boats
creations-chat 2020-04-07 17:19:49 My working submarine
creations-chat 2020-04-07 17:29:03 My folding ship for the ship Wright, it has 548 blocks.
creations-chat 2020-04-07 17:31:52 Last one was the wrong image, this is my folding ship
creations-chat 2020-04-07 17:32:05 Hold on
creations-chat 2020-04-07 17:32:28 It wasnt floating in the air when I took the screenshot
creations-chat 2020-04-12 22:43:05 The valkyrie: a helium airship with 6 guns and 4 missiles, two missiles on the large rear turrets and two on top
creations-chat 2020-04-13 01:26:46 Why do all my builds get downvoted?
creations-chat 2020-04-13 01:28:55 I dont know what's wrong with them
creations-chat 2020-04-13 01:29:02 They just get downvoted a lot
creations-chat 2020-04-13 01:29:22 My builds
creations-chat 2020-04-13 01:32:30 I share my builds to try getting a designer role so I can report bugs and suggest stuff
creations-chat 2020-04-13 01:33:14 Where it reverses wherever you click/tap?
creations-chat 2020-04-13 01:33:19 That happens with me
creations-chat 2020-04-13 01:33:45 Huh
creations-chat 2020-04-13 01:35:09 Wanna know what I've been wanting to suggest
creations-chat 2020-04-13 01:35:25 Explosive cylinders are one thing
creations-chat 2020-04-13 01:35:37 To make custom weapons easier
creations-chat 2020-04-13 01:35:41 Also
creations-chat 2020-04-13 01:35:56 Make it so explosives dont bounce off of stuff at high speeds
creations-chat 2020-04-13 01:37:58 I use explosives for my custom weapons and firing them is a pain because theres only explosive blocks to use for ammo, then when I do manage to fire them they just bounce off the target
creations-chat 2020-04-13 01:38:33 I've had to use cutters for most of my weapons
creations-chat 2020-04-13 01:38:43 But they dont deal as much damage
creations-chat 2020-04-13 01:40:24 The video isn't working
creations-chat 2020-04-13 01:41:28 Still no
creations-chat 2020-04-13 01:41:43 Dm it to me?
creations-chat 2020-04-13 01:44:08 How do I get the shipwright role?
creations-chat 2020-04-13 01:44:18 I posted a working ship

creations-chat 2020-05-13 19:28:07 I'm going to be making a mini navy battle group, this is my miniature aircraft carrier (the plane uses hovers because they have to stay at a certain height above the water
creations-chat 2020-05-13 19:28:44 It is
creations-chat 2020-05-13 19:28:57 Motor 2's work really well
creations-chat 2020-05-13 19:36:55 I'm able to move buttons
creations-chat 2020-05-13 19:37:18 Right is plane controls left is carrier controls
creations-chat 2020-05-13 19:37:38 Someone actually told me to screw off when I was using it
creations-chat 2020-05-13 19:39:30 Hold on
creations-chat 2020-05-13 19:40:46 My post didn't show up in <#384025409945337856>
creations-chat 2020-05-13 19:42:39 My mini aircraft carrier, the plane works (it uses hovers because it needs to stay a certain height above the water)
creations-chat 2020-05-13 19:43:33 Nvm

creations-chat 2021-04-11 01:09:13 Anything I can do to make people like this better? I already have 2 downvotes
creations-chat 2021-04-11 01:11:15 The hedron
creations-chat 2021-04-11 01:13:19 It's an octohedron that cannot rotate and is omnidirectional, it's not just a blob
creations-chat 2021-04-11 01:15:51 I didnt want to start an argument because of my question
creations-chat 2021-04-11 01:19:08 I added a better explanation to it
creations-chat 2021-04-11 01:21:32 No need to insult, he's being polite and asking a question
creations-chat 2021-04-11 01:23:33 Looks pretty cool, I wouldnt be able to make a normal looking plane for sure
creations-chat 2021-04-11 01:25:34 Btw isn't directing Cussing or insults at someone against the rules?
creations-chat 2021-04-11 01:27:37 Well guess what, I am lgbtq+

He called me gay, which I am technically
creations-chat 2021-04-11 01:31:17 Yeah, it is. I didnt mean to start an argument but oh well
creations-chat 2021-04-11 01:34:17 I'll do a video of it, I can't show its inner workings cause a friend developed the gadgets in it
creations-chat 2021-04-11 01:37:28 Ok, stop arguing, I'll do a video demonstrating it and link it in the comment
creations-chat 2021-04-11 01:39:32 I painted it that way to make it look ominous or similar to that octohedron angel from evangelion, i will show a video of it moving soon
creations-chat 2021-04-11 01:41:59 Can you stop arguing, I dont want drama and I dont want people thinking I caused this trouble
creations-chat 2021-04-11 01:44:20 You're allowed to downvote, just dont cuss at each other or throw insults
creations-chat 2021-04-11 01:48:52 Question, what does please the community?
creations-chat 2021-04-11 01:50:54 Like what? Idk what classifies as a good build, clearly its not complex ones that do it
creations-chat 2021-04-11 01:53:01 It may not look fancy but it took a lot of work to cram everything into that small space, it's full of functionality, I'm not good at fancy build, just functional ones
creations-chat 2021-04-11 01:55:03 It took effort, it's just not as flashy or fancy as other things
creations-chat 2021-04-11 01:57:04 ?
creations-chat 2021-04-11 01:59:41 Oh wow
creations-chat 2021-04-11 03:05:20 Lmao
creations-chat 2021-04-11 23:36:14 Hey <@456226577798135808> how does your kinetic bike work?
creations-chat 2021-04-11 23:45:44 Ok
creations-chat 2021-04-21 04:11:19 <@493681785566265348> how does the block work?
creations-chat 2021-07-26 22:19:13 Who ping me in <#384025409945337856>
creations-chat 2021-07-26 22:21:29 Percival has a spinning shield blade on its left arm (with springs to enhance range) , Galahad has a ball on a chain (ended up behind its leg In the image) and explosive spears for Lancelot (that fold out)
creations-chat 2021-07-26 22:23:49 Any ideas for other weapons to put on centaur frames? They need to be pretty light or the motors wiggle a lot, that happened with an attempt at a pincer weapon but I may have a fix for it now
creations-chat 2021-07-26 22:25:54 I could try that, any unique melee weapons? Shouldve added I'm making these for melee combat
creations-chat 2021-07-26 22:28:44 Like a blade that gets launched by a spring? Springs can't cut stuff with just their force, they need spin which is what percival has, a spring saw

The claw weapon will hopefully be like gundam barbatos's giant wrench saw thing

Itll be used to grab and chop mechs in half (hopefully)
creations-chat 2021-07-26 22:31:05 I'm gonna make an Arthur centaur frame that's larger and might use the saw wrench thing as its special weapon
the-dump 2021-07-26 22:57:49 Hack into someone's account and hide an anchor block in all of their builds, bonus if ur on mobile and remove the keybinds (this Is a joke don't do this)
the-dump 2021-07-26 22:59:38 It's so evil, especially for large builds
the-dump 2021-07-26 23:00:11 Worse than just deleting them outright cause they still have them but can't use them at all
the-dump 2021-07-26 23:00:31 I feel like I've opened pandoras box for bad hacking ideas
the-dump 2021-07-26 23:40:26 Sussy boi

the-dump 2021-11-14 02:28:36 The heck are they spraying in?
the-dump 2021-11-14 02:29:42 Seeing as it's upside down its probably that
the-dump 2021-11-14 02:30:03 It's what's normally used as a propellant in cans
the-dump 2021-12-06 06:25:06 How does Albert the unfindable crab work exactly? There's a few ways that he could be found while remaining unfindable
 
The first idea is that when found he wipes the memory of his finder. leaving only the knowledge that he, Albert the unfindable crab exists, causing knowledge of him to spread and more people to search for and find him, only to have his existence implanted in their minds and spread yet again. Another thought is that Albert is never the same crab, when found he is not, he becomes a different crab and in his place? An ordinary crab. Albert could have been any crab you've ever found, except he may not have been, he wasn't the crab you found, not once you found him. 

In the end, you will never truly find Albert, he will always remain just out of your reach
the-dump 2021-12-06 06:27:26 Tf is the slaughter?
the-dump 2021-12-06 06:27:32 Is this about pc

events-chat 2022-01-16 20:20:30 I want mech event
events-chat 2022-01-16 20:20:46 I wanna build a new mech and have a reason to do so
events-chat 2022-01-16 20:21:02 What would the rules be?
events-chat 2022-01-16 20:21:34 Probably
events-chat 2022-01-16 20:21:57 I hope I won't need to use a template
events-chat 2022-01-16 20:22:24 Nice
events-chat 2022-01-16 20:24:01 Nice

What would the rules be? I imagine there would need to be at least some to define what a mech would be (so no one makes a wheeled thing that's faster than everything else or flies more than it walks)
events-chat 2022-01-16 20:25:12 This is a gud tut

https://youtu.be/YbsyWElyVo0
events-chat 2022-01-16 20:27:05 I'm planning to make my own
events-chat 2022-01-16 20:27:24 There could be some kind of qualifiers if anyone's is really worries about good fights
events-chat 2022-01-16 20:29:04 Last time I made a mech half my keyboard had to be used
events-chat 2022-01-16 20:30:26 Yeah, give it a try and give the competitors some time to practice and build
events-chat 2022-01-16 20:31:00 Maybe there could be only melee, explosives are pretty unfair against stuff with so many joints
events-chat 2022-01-16 20:31:23 Cutters for the only damage dealing
events-chat 2022-01-16 20:32:06 I think just cutters would be good
events-chat 2022-01-16 20:32:22 No guns, rockets bombs, fireworks, etc
events-chat 2022-01-16 20:32:59 Only 6? How big would the mech be? What's the size limit?
events-chat 2022-01-16 20:33:56 I don't like making huge mechs, idk about everyone else thi
events-chat 2022-01-16 20:34:18 My mechs aren't large but I don't have to make them tiny either
events-chat 2022-01-16 20:39:08 Most mechs I know of aren't good Hill climbers
events-chat 2022-01-16 20:40:53 Medium mech 1v1 is what I'd want
events-chat 2022-01-16 20:41:09 A bunch of mechs fighting at once would be chaotic
events-chat 2022-01-16 20:41:25 And possibly laggy
events-chat 2022-01-16 20:41:41 Medium to small
events-chat 2022-01-16 20:41:58 Still chaotic, and most mechs I know of can't walk up steep hills
events-chat 2022-01-16 20:42:27 Idk just the rails or smthn
events-chat 2022-01-16 20:42:45 What size should we make them
events-chat 2022-01-16 20:43:00 I'm gonna start making a medium to small rn, I don't like big
events-chat 2022-01-16 20:43:34 Not everyone makes flying mechs
events-chat 2022-01-16 20:45:28 Centaur mech
events-chat 2022-01-16 20:48:10 I'll just use the one tut I made for a really mobile vehicle
events-chat 2022-01-16 20:50:34 Those are really big
events-chat 2022-01-16 20:51:02 The one I was gonna make wouldn't have even been 15 blocks
events-chat 2022-01-16 20:51:18 :|
events-chat 2022-01-16 20:52:02 Ok
events-chat 2022-01-16 20:52:23 Make sure they dictate what is classified as a mech
events-chat 2022-01-16 20:53:35 Bone mech with meat armor
events-chat 2022-01-16 20:53:53 Snake
events-chat 2022-01-16 20:57:27 Even just a few guns would be annoying, I think just cutters is how it should be
events-chat 2022-01-16 20:58:45 Gundam barbatos in most fights:
events-chat 2022-01-16 20:59:22 Tanks aren't filled with motors and lanky limbs
events-chat 2022-01-16 20:59:48 They're also faster than mechs by far so they can dodge better
events-chat 2022-01-16 21:00:13 Actually yes you can
events-chat 2022-01-16 21:00:29 Why
events-chat 2022-01-16 21:01:55 A sunny day probably
events-chat 2022-01-16 21:16:46 Motorlock yes, gigantic over folders seem overkill
events-chat 2022-01-16 21:17:09 What are the rules
events-chat 2022-01-16 21:18:12 I'm trying make this (not to the same scale tho)
events-chat 2022-01-16 21:18:31 Yes
events-chat 2022-01-16 21:20:53 Color a missile bright blue 🤔
events-chat 2022-01-16 21:32:58 What does it mean by no glitches?
events-chat 2022-01-16 21:33:54 I was gonna use a suspension thing for turning my mech instead of thrusters and stuff **:|**
events-chat 2022-01-16 21:34:41 Glitch a friend discovered, locks an axis and I mainly use it for turning
events-chat 2022-01-16 21:36:17 It's a glitch a friend found, idk if I can share it
events-chat 2022-01-16 21:37:09 Maybe they could share it and apply for the inventor role if that still exists
events-chat 2022-01-16 21:38:47 Darn
events-chat 2022-01-16 21:39:13 I'm asking them rn, they aren't online so it might take a bit
events-chat 2022-01-16 21:39:44 The glitch is really useful for turning
events-chat 2022-01-16 21:40:00 And preventing wobble

Not much else
events-chat 2022-01-16 21:40:23 Not even a robot specialist role
events-chat 2022-01-16 21:40:48 Kinda yes kinda no
events-chat 2022-01-16 21:41:38 I got my robot specialist role from one of my ancient robots I don't have anymore
events-chat 2022-01-16 21:46:54 Hello
events-chat 2022-01-16 21:50:45 281 days
events-chat 2022-01-16 21:51:51 A year ago is when I first learned of it too
events-chat 2022-01-16 21:52:07 Inventor is gone from what I was told
events-chat 2022-01-16 21:52:48 <@466793357318815744> would this be allowed in the event?
events-chat 2022-01-16 21:53:20 If I could still apply for inventor I'd say to give it to moth as they found it
events-chat 2022-01-16 21:54:04 It was suggestive 😏
events-chat 2022-01-16 21:54:42 Same
events-chat 2022-01-16 21:55:34 Arthur be like
events-chat 2022-01-16 21:56:18 Shredders are easy and get boring so fast, I made some, pvp'd for 5 minutes and got bored

(When I first started playing)
events-chat 2022-01-16 21:57:03 Who's that?
events-chat 2022-01-16 21:57:47 Which admin is hyperbit
events-chat 2022-01-16 21:58:25 Also where could I ask admins about the inventor role? If I could get it for moth I'd like to cuz they deserve it for finding this
events-chat 2022-01-16 21:58:50 Green one ._.

Kermit the frog?
events-chat 2022-01-16 21:59:31 Hey could the Axis lock glitch be used in the mech event?
events-chat 2022-01-16 22:00:13 Only for turrets
events-chat 2022-01-16 22:01:26 <@466793357318815744> do I ask hyperbit here or in dms?
events-chat 2022-01-16 22:01:43 5 what
events-chat 2022-01-16 22:05:17 Don't make me Un-anchor your arms
events-chat 2022-01-16 22:06:38 At least 3 I think
events-chat 2022-01-16 22:08:21 How many ounces of phosgene was in the pizza?
events-chat 2022-01-16 22:13:16 You fool! I am everyone else in this discord
events-chat 2022-01-16 22:13:42 Don't have to

😎
events-chat 2022-01-16 22:14:05 How would you even abuse an anchor block on a mech?
events-chat 2022-01-16 22:14:54 That just sounds like how I Crack my back every morning
events-chat 2022-01-16 22:16:12 Challenge, use only blocks you find in the first shredder tut you find
events-chat 2022-01-16 22:29:34 Just go star platinum on them lol

(Ik that's that's star platinum but I'm just more into JJBA)
events-chat 2022-01-16 22:29:57 Really do be going ***ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA***
events-chat 2022-01-17 02:10:37 Yessss
events-chat 2022-01-17 07:17:53 If you spin a gun it'll spread its fire out, doesn't deal extra damage tho
events-chat 2022-01-17 09:16:01 I asked hyper and the axis lock isn't allowed for the event :|

I'll have to figure something else out
events-chat 2022-01-17 09:16:39 Legs moving should be the primary form of locomotion, not wheels

the-dump 2022-01-19 06:10:18 Good gaming chair
events-chat 2022-01-20 07:48:04 Wait that whip doesn't even have cutters
events-chat 2022-01-20 07:48:43 Yeah that would work
events-chat 2022-01-20 07:49:03 Yeah
events-chat 2022-01-20 07:50:37 I was gonna participate but Idk if I wanna try to make a mech without my axis lock, since it isn't allowed
events-chat 2022-01-20 07:52:12 Not sure, I could go looking through my mech concept art folder to see if I can find any cool designs if you want
events-chat 2022-01-20 07:52:28 (Unrelated to this event, just came in handy now)
events-chat 2022-01-20 07:53:57 Here's a few that have more than 2 legs
events-chat 2022-01-20 07:54:31 They sound similar so idk which would be better, though more legs and a more grounded design would be more durable
events-chat 2022-01-20 07:54:48 Give them sword arms/claws
events-chat 2022-01-20 07:55:07 Yeah
events-chat 2022-01-20 07:55:24 I made a crab walker at one point, it was fun
events-chat 2022-01-20 07:56:13 I think if I'm gonna make a mech for the event I'll do a quadruped
events-chat 2022-01-20 07:58:01 Depends on the method of walking, pistons are slow but a pure motor design can be adjusted
events-chat 2022-01-20 07:58:18 Jumping spider
events-chat 2022-01-20 07:59:11 I've made bipedal mechs capable of reaching a 60-70 sprint speed
events-chat 2022-01-20 08:13:57 Grabbing stuff is kinda deadly, especially with cutters since it would either just get stuck on the weapon or be cut in half
events-chat 2022-01-21 01:40:19 Japanese spider crab
events-chat 2022-01-21 02:21:57 Bipedal crab? That means two legged
events-chat 2022-01-21 02:22:17 Fiddler crab is what you're looking for
events-chat 2022-01-21 02:22:52 I think fiddler would be neat, just snip off the enemy mechs legs
the-dump 2022-01-24 16:18:33 
the-dump 2022-01-24 16:24:49 I thought I corrected it, my meme generator doesn't always save text
the-dump 2022-01-24 16:51:28 How does Albert the unfindable crab work exactly? There's a few ways that he could be found while remaining unfindable
 
The first idea is that when found he wipes the memory of his finder. leaving only the knowledge that he, Albert the unfindable crab exists, causing knowledge of him to spread and more people to search for and find him, only to have his existence implanted in their minds and spread yet again. Another thought is that Albert is never the same crab, when found he is not, he becomes a different crab and in his place? An ordinary crab. Albert could have been any crab you've ever found, except he may not have been, he wasn't the crab you found, not once you found him. 

In the end, you will never truly find Albert, he will always remain just out of your reach
the-dump 2022-01-24 17:09:57 Exactly
the-dump 2022-01-24 18:03:58 Does anyone know what song this is
the-dump 2022-01-24 18:14:42 Thanks!
events-chat 2022-02-04 19:29:05 What's the current event?
events-chat 2022-02-04 19:31:17 Bomber or normal
events-chat 2022-02-04 19:31:33 Is it just dogfights or bomber hunting
events-chat 2022-02-04 19:32:36 I am
events-chat 2022-02-04 19:33:31 I'm just confused, the rules are everywhere and I don't know which are set in stone
events-chat 2022-02-04 19:34:43 Ik, it's just a lot of different things
events-chat 2022-02-04 19:38:03 What would the benefit of making an attacking bomber over a fighter? Swivels aren't allowed so it's basically just a fighter
events-chat 2022-02-04 19:38:42 Also what counts as looks like a plane? Does it have to be modern, ww2, future
events-chat 2022-02-04 19:41:47 And what constitutes a plane? Wings?
events-chat 2022-02-04 19:44:12 ._.
events-chat 2022-02-04 19:45:45 I know what planes are normally, but in an event such as this there could be a lot to constitute what that could be
events-chat 2022-02-04 19:47:12 I'm just trying to understand what  counts as a plane so I know what I can build
events-chat 2022-02-04 19:48:32 With the kinds of things I build that's not specific enough, I don't want to build something that ends up not being allowed
events-chat 2022-02-04 19:48:56 I make scifi things
events-chat 2022-02-04 19:49:56 So it just needs to *look* like a plane?
events-chat 2022-02-04 19:50:54 I'm not trying to be quirky, I was just asking what counted as a plane
events-chat 2022-02-04 19:52:33 I know what a normal plane is, it was the question of what still counts as a plane
events-chat 2022-02-04 19:54:21 All I asked was what was considered a plane in this context, not to be insulted
events-chat 2022-02-04 19:54:37 You've hurled more insults at me than advice
events-chat 2022-02-04 19:56:08 I wanted to build something more abstract so I asked about what counts as a plane, I'm not as into making normal planes and also didn't want to just slap wings on something
events-chat 2022-02-04 19:57:08 I'm no good at making normal planes so I wanted to make something that I could make and that I'd like more
events-chat 2022-02-04 19:58:20 I still want to, I was just seeing how far I could make it into scifi
events-chat 2022-02-04 19:59:17 I know the difference, it was me asking what counts for *this* event
events-chat 2022-02-04 20:00:09 It says it needs to look like a plane, it didn't really specify which is what made me ask the question in the first place
events-chat 2022-02-04 20:02:57 I'll build something I enjoy building but ill keep it within the boundaries of looking like a plane

There, I just wanted to figure what I could do and still count as a plane

I'm done here as I didn't want to be insulted and harassed over a question about what would count as a plane in this event
events-chat 2022-02-04 20:04:23 It was mainly Alx now that I'm looking back
events-chat 2022-02-04 20:06:40 Even if I dont get selected it still give me a reason to build something
events-chat 2022-02-04 20:09:20 That's what I'm doing, even if I'm not selected I'll still have a reason to build something I like
events-chat 2022-02-04 20:11:12 I'll build what I want, maybe I will be selected, maybe I won't but I'll still have a build that I enjoy using
events-chat 2022-02-04 20:13:28 Evasive maneuvers for dealing with anyone behind, above, below, to the left, to the right, in front and in the 5th dimension
events-chat 2022-02-04 20:14:14 I dont know if I won't, I'll still try
the-dump 2022-02-04 20:47:44 
events-chat 2022-02-04 20:48:06 I'm gonna make a scifi plane, I'll ask here if it counts for it
the-dump 2022-02-04 20:49:18 
the-dump 2022-02-04 20:53:56 
the-dump 2022-02-04 21:00:53 Not always

Some are bi
the-dump 2022-02-04 21:01:11 Still like 50% gæ tho
events-chat 2022-02-21 07:25:06 Even if I dont end up making one, would a torpedo with a rope attacked like a harpoon be allowed? Like a cutter based torpedo that launches off, deals damage and pulls back in with the downside of no explosives cuz it would make them one time use anyways
events-chat 2022-02-21 07:32:04 It might if the cutter blade had some for of spin
events-chat 2022-02-21 07:32:20 But yeah, I've noticed that ropes mess with cutters weird
events-chat 2022-02-21 07:32:37 Spinning cutters can be surprising
events-chat 2022-02-21 07:32:58 I'll try some tests
events-chat 2022-02-21 07:33:16 It's an interesting concept
events-chat 2022-02-21 07:33:39 Maybe it would work better if there was a way to trigger a spring or something as soon as it made contact with the enemy
events-chat 2022-02-21 07:34:25 Detectors would be neat in this game, like something that activated adjacent blocks
events-chat 2022-02-21 07:35:23 Like motor lock through it?
events-chat 2022-02-21 07:36:02 It would take timing but could be interesting

An Armour piercing weapon to immediately blast the internals would be effective, especially if there anything important
events-chat 2022-02-21 07:36:48 Oooh, Armor piercing harpoon
events-chat 2022-02-21 07:37:23 Stick into the enemy and reel them in so they're an easier target for allies, maybe even whatever other weapons are allowed on the torpedo ship if any
events-chat 2022-02-21 07:39:05 It's more likely to happen the less blocks are there, motor locking several blocks through (Maybe with gaps in between as failsafes) would help insure it staying in for a good while
events-chat 2022-02-21 07:39:25 Only issue would be they'd be harder to re-use since motor lock can't be re locked
events-chat 2022-02-21 07:40:06 But I think being able to grab an enemy would be really cool
events-chat 2022-02-21 07:41:57 Depends on how thick armor is a double motor lock might suffice, with the hook thing on the end attached to a text block
events-chat 2022-02-21 07:42:39 That would be cool, maybe the harpoon could somehow inject/allow a form of attack onto the enemy ship
events-chat 2022-02-21 07:45:38 Maybe the ship using them could have extra frontal armor as well as armored harpoons, just a few seconds of immobility might be all that's needed to deal a deadly hit on an important part
events-chat 2022-02-21 07:46:13 I might try
events-chat 2022-02-21 07:46:44 Or at least make designs to share with others, I don't do too well making outright good ships but I'm pretty good at making gadgets and such for them
events-chat 2022-02-21 07:47:00 Maybe if I want to ill make a harpoon design to share
events-chat 2022-02-21 07:47:55 Yeah, that's one idea, reel in one's with explosive so you get the most out of them or hook people with them and pull the entire ship in
events-chat 2022-02-21 07:48:52 Probably some kind of controller, I thing it would he kinda funny to have a device that moves it around erratically, maybe with cutters on it for the payload
events-chat 2022-02-21 07:49:26 Not even accurate control would be needed, just something chaotic that makes moving really irritating
events-chat 2022-02-21 07:50:38 Imagine trying to fight some dude in an airship and he shoots something at you, doesn't deal any damage with it but then tour airship decides to start making a U turn upwards
events-chat 2022-02-21 07:51:01 Lmao
events-chat 2022-02-21 07:51:44 A motorlocked RAT would be neat, something that gets bigger and locks into place inside the ship by unlocking to expand
events-chat 2022-02-21 07:52:20 Just put cutters on the RAT and let it go chaotic inside the ship, eventually it'll mess up something important
events-chat 2022-02-21 07:53:52 That actually got me to laugh, a mass motorlock that destroys the turrets and overweighs the ship causing it to sink
events-chat 2022-02-21 07:54:10 Wait

Do ballast blocks Increase weight?
events-chat 2022-02-21 07:54:29 Like the ones that change weight
events-chat 2022-02-21 07:54:50 Not the ones that you set a certain weight to, I mean the ballast tank things
events-chat 2022-02-21 07:55:20 And I'm assuming that if a ship touches the ground it's considered out right?
events-chat 2022-02-21 07:56:02 If so

Ballast tanks that are set to light until injected into the enemy ship, upon which they are increased in weight and overpower the helium
events-chat 2022-02-21 07:56:38 Basically the equivalent of injecting lead into an airplanes fuselage
events-chat 2022-02-21 07:57:14 That'd be so funny to see if they didn't know what happened, they'd just have their ship drop like a rock or at least become extremely off balance
events-chat 2022-02-21 07:59:36 I like the idea of injecting a ton of weight into a ship or a controller to cause chaotic movement

Harpoons could be fun but also lead to being close to an enemy
events-chat 2022-02-21 08:00:20 I think cutters should only be allowed on torpedos or very limited amounts on the bow of a ship to act like what would actually happen if you rammed a ship
events-chat 2022-02-21 08:01:39 It's all fun and games till 3 of the attackers manage to fill the dreadnought with weights/RAT's and cause it to sink (it would be hard to pull off but would look kinda funny)
events-chat 2022-02-21 08:02:00 Yeah I can't build Yo momma
events-chat 2022-02-21 08:02:38 In the Injections or dreadnought?

If it was in the dreadnought then it would still be immobilized
events-chat 2022-02-21 08:03:22 How
events-chat 2022-02-21 08:04:02 More weights, or more RAT's with more power
events-chat 2022-02-21 08:04:32 More RAT's probably

Go ahead and try to shoot the stuff inside your ship
events-chat 2022-02-21 08:04:58 Maybe a motor locked expando bomb to really reach everywhere
events-chat 2022-02-21 08:05:44 It could expand through the ship and have tnt spaced enough to reach everywhere in between the spaces without need for excessive tnt
events-chat 2022-02-21 08:07:08 If I dont make a ship I'll at least try to come up with some designs for torpedos and stuff
events-chat 2022-02-21 19:36:48 I'd presume touching the ground is you're out
events-chat 2022-02-21 19:37:55 Im gonna try to make a torpedo that automatically peirces the enemy ship to inject some form of payload into it
events-chat 2022-02-22 10:06:12 Does the torpedo zep get anything other than torpedos?
events-chat 2022-02-22 10:08:04 The torpedo description didn't say no guns but I still wanna make sure
events-chat 2022-02-22 21:31:01 What does your grappler look like?
events-chat 2022-02-22 21:31:46 How are you planning it to work?
events-chat 2022-02-22 21:32:45 Hover drive?
events-chat 2022-02-22 21:33:04 Toggled motorlock?
events-chat 2022-02-22 21:33:23 Ah
events-chat 2022-02-22 21:34:05 I tested a harpoon version that used a harmless explosive to release a motor lock
events-chat 2022-02-22 21:34:25 It sometimes pierced but wasn't the best
events-chat 2022-02-22 22:59:56 Yesss
events-chat 2022-02-22 23:00:21 Little planes
events-chat 2022-02-23 02:14:23 Do the destroyer and torpedo get turrets or are the guns fixed?
events-chat 2022-02-23 02:14:57 For floating
events-chat 2022-02-23 05:28:10 Maybe use motors and wing panels as air brakes, just rotate the wing panel to a vertical position to slow down and horizontal to resume speed
events-chat 2022-02-23 05:29:53 You fool

events-chat 2022-02-23 05:41:07 Ah, I understand why you said it'll one shot the dreadnought, you'll still need to have good aim
events-chat 2022-02-23 05:41:23 No pobsem
events-chat 2022-02-23 05:42:25 Yeah but these are unguided
events-chat 2022-02-23 05:42:43 What if I stole yours first?
events-chat 2022-02-23 05:43:30 I have a pair of pliers and a bucket of determination, that's not gonna make me back down

creations-chat 2022-05-29 07:51:08 Agreed

My mech somehow got upvotes even tho it's looks came second and I'm pretty sure there's exposed motor lock
creations-chat 2022-05-29 07:53:35 This is my mech btw 

Nit pick all you want and I'll do my best to defend it <:trollface:775024642104229898>

Just no blatant toxicity

Response to BQ since cooldown long, I'll see if I can add weathering though I'm not sure how I'd do that, it doesn't have much space for detail unfortunately but if there's a way I'll try, plus I don't want it looking too dirty
creations-chat 2022-05-29 07:56:35 Same, they have good builds
creations-chat 2022-05-29 07:59:06 I focus on function over looks, my fenrir mechs back is pretty bad looking, but that's cause it needs space for some other stuff that helps it function 

I can fight most pvp server builds that aren't jets or covered in cutters or explosives
creations-chat 2022-05-29 08:02:37 That would be so fun to attack with my mech, at least for me

Shredding big stuff is fun in general
creations-chat 2022-05-29 08:05:06 I'm surprised I haven't had more critique on my mech

creations-chat 2022-06-01 21:18:27 Biold?

Also I'm memeing on Chris like everyone else is
creations-chat 2022-06-01 21:20:34 Do you mean you don't like my bio?
creations-chat 2022-06-01 21:25:12 Yeah i just decided to post it cause I wanted to join in on the meme, the original post is farther up

It's called the Fenrir mech btw
creations-chat 2022-06-01 21:29:32 Yeah I chose the red cause of Sam's murasama

events-chat 2022-06-02 00:24:33 I'll turn a 1x1 panel into a 1x2 panel
events-chat 2022-06-02 00:24:49 What's there to be confused by?
events-chat 2022-06-02 00:25:14 :0
events-chat 2022-06-02 01:08:59 Lmao
events-chat 2022-06-02 01:09:45 Pov: you made a valid point and proper criticism of something but they reply "didn't ask"

(The stfu doesn't matter in this btw)
creations-chat 2022-06-02 01:13:46 Infinity gods anti shredder is actually super effective (it also looks better spawned in and moving)
the-dump 2022-06-02 01:21:25 There are three types of men
creations-chat 2022-06-02 01:30:20 He only uses it against shredders, plus one of the best ways to deal with them is just let them ram into your own cutters and kill themselves

Shooting them down works for the ones that don't have conv drives and people who use shredders against shredders are the only shredders users I'm fine with
creations-chat 2022-06-02 01:34:09 If it's something like some of the shredders I've seen a tnt shotgun wouldn't work, nor would missiles and such

Kamikaze could work but anti shredders also work, they're basically kamikaze that doesn't kill itself immediately

They just rush from one side of the map to the other in an instant and destroy everything in their path, aiming is tough with stuff like that, especially when they go basically anywhere the mouse is

The main issue with tnt shotguns is aiming at them before they shred you
creations-chat 2022-06-02 01:37:00 For the smaller ones I fight with my combat vehicle, but as soon as they start using conv drives and stuff it becomes nearly impossible

Idk how they do it but I've seen at least three big shredders that use some form of hyper speed drive
creations-chat 2022-06-02 01:40:04 Cutters still seem to work above those speeds, I've got a flying mech that goes that fast and it can still melee

It actually cuts better at high speeds

Also yeah, they're either children or people trying to feel good about doing well in a game

Dodging them is sometimes easy sometimes hard and some people don't always have the device or skill to deal with them
creations-chat 2022-06-02 01:42:17 De spawn it, I'm curious

Wait I'm dumb

Unless you edited it after but idk

How much tnt?

Bruh gonna blanket the sky

Yeah that's gonna cover the sky

Got an image of it firing? (From before you're away)

If it crashes the game it still stops shredders

I know someone who made what was essentially a server off switch

Near instant server crash
creations-chat 2022-06-02 01:45:55 Dear lord

That would work in non pvp servers <:trollface:775024642104229898>

I actually suggested he use headless pistons on his anti shredder but it crashed his game as soon as I touched it, in his defense it did discombobulate my mech

creations-chat 2022-06-07 19:30:41 How does this thing even walk?
creations-chat 2022-06-13 15:56:32 Needs to be more symmetrical
the-dump 2022-06-15 15:57:41 That's another gaming tip, if you don't have a dad he can't scold you for playing games

the-dump 2022-06-16 18:35:38 
events-chat 2022-06-17 01:55:30 Could be interesting for a stealth combat survival thing, like several players in small lightly armed vehicles trying to survive a larger heavily armed one

the-dump 2022-06-24 06:34:21 How is it mouse controlled?
the-dump 2022-06-24 06:35:52 I wanna figure out how to make gyros like that
the-dump 2022-06-24 06:47:15 That's quite a basic explanation for that, is there a tut on youtube for it or is it your own design?

creations-chat 2022-11-04 02:20:32 Its not a creation either
creations-chat 2022-11-04 02:22:54 Not really
creations-chat 2022-11-04 16:01:20 Yeee, people are using my mech frame tut!
creations-chat 2022-11-04 16:08:08 Because it's getting popular, though I still don't fully approve of a tut in <#384025409945337856> for obvious reasons
creations-chat 2022-11-04 17:08:42 It can be scaled up but I haven't made any larger versions really, I prefer smaller mechs 

In theory it would be pretty easy tho

the-dump 2023-01-07 08:24:53 Truly a curse, now let me post this original meme I found in what I'm pretty sure was a different server
bug-reports 2023-01-10 23:18:18 I think that's an issue with ping/lag
bug-reports 2023-01-11 00:34:51 If you're laggier than normal it'll happen, sometimes it just does
bug-reports 2023-01-11 00:34:54 What's your ping?
creations-chat 2023-01-11 15:14:03 Does my mech look good?
creations-chat 2023-01-11 15:41:26 Imo it's a bit smooth, but yeah it isn't terrible
creations-chat 2023-01-11 15:44:38 Stability, also walking isn't as important when your mech flies most of the time, and it's also less effective in combat for more moving parts
creations-chat 2023-01-11 15:47:12 Nice, I'd recommend more texture/colors
creations-chat 2023-01-11 15:54:25 Wings don't look as good as actual legs and adding a walking system would just be more moving parts to worry about in pvp, which is mostly mid-air
creations-chat 2023-01-11 15:59:33 I try and make mine capable of combat in public pvp against non mech things
creations-chat 2023-01-12 00:10:47 Hover boots, though it doesn't have them anymore cause of issues caused by them, might remake them to fix it tho
creations-chat 2023-02-22 18:32:34 I wonder if his Ratte is even his too
creations-chat 2023-02-22 18:36:55 At some point it's block count doubled too apparently, even though there aren't any new images or proof of these claims
creations-chat 2023-02-22 19:06:04 Any proof of this? Got any screenshots?
creations-chat 2023-02-22 19:12:02 You respond to this but not a request for proof?
creations-chat 2023-02-22 19:14:40 It should be simple, get a screenshot of it unloaded on your plot, maybe with a sign saying your name here or something, same with the star destroyer
creations-chat 2023-02-22 19:18:49 Screenshotting, same way you'd get proof anywhere else
creations-chat 2023-02-22 19:21:08 Lol, all I saw was the N slur however I have a feeling he used a lot more than just that in the first one
creations-chat 2023-02-22 19:23:53 Power button and volume down
