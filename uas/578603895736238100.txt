plane-crazy 2020-07-06 21:28:05 They act like they have they have thrusters attached
plane-crazy 2020-07-06 21:27:34 They arent
plane-crazy 2020-07-06 21:27:06 It's meant to require 2 players to sail
plane-crazy 2020-07-06 21:26:44 But it needs them to steer
plane-crazy 2020-07-06 21:26:35 Its panels
plane-crazy 2020-07-06 21:26:05 Darn
plane-crazy 2020-07-06 21:25:42 The first one is fine
plane-crazy 2020-07-06 21:25:37 When I made the second sail it freaked out
plane-crazy 2020-07-06 21:25:09 Unpowered so players can turn the sails
plane-crazy 2020-07-06 21:24:38 They go crazy
plane-crazy 2020-07-06 21:24:28 
plane-crazy 2020-07-06 21:20:28 I'm trying to make a ship but the wing panels start bugging out
plane-crazy 2020-06-02 02:28:04 There's a dude that's pestering me then when I near his plot he blacklists and un blacklists me just to be annoying
plane-crazy 2020-05-30 16:52:19 I now mainly build ships
plane-crazy 2020-05-30 16:52:08 It flew really well
plane-crazy 2020-05-30 16:52:01 I lost a giant plane that's whole wings angled

plane-crazy 2020-05-14 22:43:50 What items do I get if I buy the summer item pack
plane-crazy 2020-05-14 22:37:01 Does the lava spitter deal damage?
plane-crazy 2020-05-14 19:44:59 Does the lava spitter deal damage?
plane-crazy 2020-05-14 18:33:57 What items are in the summer and winter event packs

plane-crazy 2020-05-13 19:06:45 I dont have a rank to suggest things but I have a suggestion
plane-crazy 2020-05-06 05:50:14 Darn
plane-crazy 2020-05-06 05:49:55 Do magnets affect vehicles other than mine?
plane-crazy 2020-05-06 05:49:17 Do magnets affect other players builds?
plane-crazy 2020-05-06 05:48:16 Do magnets affect builds other than your own?
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 05:01:00 How do I make a conveyor engine?
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 04:13:05 How many studs is a block in this game
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 04:10:13 Is the range of the magnet count in blocks?
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 01:56:03 I couldn't place stuff
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 01:55:56 Everything was moved to the right
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 01:55:38 I fixed the glitch
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 01:48:38 Ranks*
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 01:48:29 I don't have any tanks to report glitches so I'm stuck dealing with it
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 01:47:48 But I cant build anything anyways
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 01:47:24 I don't know what either of those things are
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 01:46:46 Conveyor drive?
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 01:42:24 The glitch of everything being placed to right is making the game unplayable
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 00:31:32 Everything is moved to the right
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 00:31:26 I can't build anything because if a glitch
plane-crazy 2020-04-07 23:22:44 
plane-crazy 2020-04-07 23:15:38 Anything I try doing is moved to the right and won't let me edit the settings of itens
plane-crazy 2020-04-07 17:06:07 What about durability?
plane-crazy 2020-04-07 17:05:48 Ok
plane-crazy 2020-04-07 17:05:23 Is that all?
plane-crazy 2020-04-07 17:05:03 Do different materials change anything?

plane-crazy 2020-04-05 00:09:06 I built a melee ship I call the antlion and tore apart a tank
plane-crazy 2020-04-03 00:08:57 Is it possible to get a pvp VIP server?
plane-crazy 2020-04-02 19:08:15 My snake tank got into a tussle with a plane
plane-crazy 2020-04-02 03:28:00 I've seen builds that have joints that allow them to bend but can't find the part (they were too thin to use motors as joints)
plane-crazy 2020-04-02 03:27:09 Is it possible to use rope as a joint that bends all ways
plane-crazy 2020-04-02 03:25:53 Can rope be used as a joint that can bend in any direction?
