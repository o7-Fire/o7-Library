creations-chat 2019-06-07 22:13:38 le X-Wing
creations-chat 2019-06-07 22:14:11 not really shaped like an X because I can't rotate but it's ok
creations-chat 2019-06-07 22:14:24 yeah
creations-chat 2019-06-07 22:14:37 gotta stick with the folded wings instead
creations-chat 2019-06-07 22:15:21 it was iffy to make tbh, alot of the mass of the entire thing was centered on the body
creations-chat 2019-06-07 22:15:33 the nose just went diving like nuts
creations-chat 2019-06-07 22:25:01 it's already lying in the x axis though
creations-chat 2019-06-07 22:25:17 i get your point anyway i shoulda done the foldy thing
creations-chat 2019-06-07 22:25:51 apart from the tutorial build
creations-chat 2019-06-07 22:26:06 that was my very first finished creation
creations-chat 2019-06-07 23:06:23 what if he created the tutorial though

Perhaps things like a distant moon area we can travel to with crazy space-going contraptions?
