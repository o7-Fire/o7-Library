The Tale of Isodium (552252221224648724)
bug-reports 2020-05-09 21:18:29 So basically every time I save and it says SAVE SUCCESSFUL, but when I rejoin, it goes back to my old version
bug-reports 2020-05-09 21:19:04 Then I have to change it everytime back to the new version
bug-reports 2020-05-09 21:19:39 Apparently this was a old glitch a year ago
bug-reports 2020-05-09 21:20:03 But it came back for some reason, anyone know how to fix it?
bug-reports 2020-05-09 21:20:19 Is it just me or is anyone else experiencing this?
bug-reports 2020-05-09 21:22:50 But as long as I stay in the game, it saves
bug-reports 2020-05-10 02:06:05 There was also like this other bug where when I spawn my boat, it just break's apart when everything is perfectly attached. It's not a big bug but it pretty annoying and you have to take a while to fix it
bug-reports 2020-05-12 19:34:09 Im not sure if this is me or the game
bug-reports 2020-05-12 19:34:29 There is no blue line on my plane
bug-reports 2020-05-12 19:34:52 I added the wings, control panels and everything else
bug-reports 2020-05-12 19:35:01 Can anyone tell me how I can fix this?
bug-reports 2020-05-12 23:31:28 Ok just recently everything stopped
bug-reports 2020-05-13 01:29:29 Apparently one time the game just stopped and this is not only me since it happened to my friend at the same time. Then rejoined and the servers were just frozen
bug-reports 2020-05-13 01:29:44 no one can do anything except walk run and jump

creations-chat 2020-06-02 18:37:39 Not that bad
creations-chat 2020-06-02 18:38:28 I've seen this other guy with a giant yamato and I have no idea how he made his turrets so flat
creations-chat 2020-06-02 18:39:10 I kinda wanted to make the turret a lil bigger since its a bigger more chonkier battleship, might've made it a tad too big
creations-chat 2020-06-02 18:39:43 Batplane?
creations-chat 2020-06-02 18:40:10 btw how do I get ranked in the discord?
creations-chat 2020-06-02 18:41:03 My battleship is about 3450 blocks without the ladder and the other blocks so what rank does that give me?
creations-chat 2020-06-02 18:44:04 I would kindly ask for a shipright rank, btw its about 3400 without the ladder and the fold
bug-reports 2020-06-10 01:10:15 Aight so if you look inside the cockpit thats made out of glass from first person view, it will not show water or at least most of it
bug-reports 2020-06-10 01:11:19 And for some reason, the motor's are kinda broken because when I closed my cockpit, it just glitched and went through the  blocks

creations-chat 2021-01-10 20:14:49 it has low details and looks kinda awkward and low quality, so you're new to plane crazy?
creations-chat 2021-01-10 20:22:26 bruh then what does the plane crazy community like? Motor lock? Details? Camera angle? Folding? overly complicated builds?
creations-chat 2021-01-10 20:26:04 yes the funny <a:A_SooFunny_FE:742166719170215967>, anyways yeah pistons for landing gear seems pretty simple and good, if you wanna go to another level you can add motors for no reason. Damnnn post the bee or put the message link
creations-chat 2021-01-10 20:29:47 damnnnnn that's gooooood, the colors and everything is accurate. but like yeah you did post that a lot but I never saw it

creations-chat 2021-01-14 23:56:06 yo how tf do people do these intakes
creations-chat 2021-01-18 22:38:49 First of all the blackhawk doors don't open and close like that, second of all the tail is a bit short and awkward, Lastly, the blackhawk has a articulating stabilator I think. Anyways is there anything I can improve on my apache, yes I know the apache has single main rotor and the cockpit isn't well made but il try motor locking it later
creations-chat 2021-01-18 22:41:53 bruh okay lol dunno man same thing
creations-chat 2021-01-18 22:44:20 Then how do I make it more ***apache***

creations-chat 2021-01-18 22:51:30 pog
creations-chat 2021-01-18 22:59:28 oh yeahhhh I see the curve, il try using motor lock for that
creations-chat 2021-01-19 23:47:11 the front is kinda awkward for the buggati creation
creations-chat 2021-01-19 23:49:31 e
creations-chat 2021-01-19 23:51:58 but did you base it off the tutorial? Either way looks kind of awkward tutorial or no tutorial

creations-chat 2021-04-11 15:31:17 yo custom mbt, a bit trash but any suggestions?
creations-chat 2021-04-11 15:36:42 I tried it but, the rockets end up like popping out after firing. the rockets are already concealed but when fired, it pops up
creations-chat 2021-04-11 15:39:48 pretty low effort ngl
