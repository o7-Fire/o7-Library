plane-crazy 2020-05-20 05:26:00 I made some random dude ragequit after he failed to kill my miniscule fighter plane that does 600 speed with even his most absurd aircraft
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 04:49:45 cannons or just any high-caliber, slow firing gun would be nice

plane-crazy 2020-05-20 03:42:57 sorry they already went up in flames, like my hopes and dreams
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 03:42:43 I guess it doesnt react well with spicy curry

plane-crazy 2020-05-20 01:08:41 https://gyazo.com/e71ad2b40ac80a7015cbc43ce431bf35 the block on the bottom is spinning even though I dont want it to halp
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 00:30:42 I figured that out right as you said that, but ty anyhow
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 00:29:29 halp meee
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 00:29:27 how can I make a helicopter rotor thingy not make the rest of the craft spin
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 06:32:12 they always float, but never sink
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 06:32:04 I have like 100 of them
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 06:30:36 any reason for this?
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 06:30:29 is it just me, or do ballast tanks not sink? I press the sink button for my ballast tanks but they don't go down. pressing the float button for them works, though.
