the-dump 2020-05-20 03:08:03 chance I might get warned or something for this but idrc
creations-chat 2020-05-20 03:21:21 does anyone know a good way to make the supports smaller on my biplane in <#384025409945337856> ? (might need to scroll up a lil)
creations-chat 2020-05-20 03:23:57 wing panels aren't gonna work out, I tried and the supports would be disconnected from the wing (visually at least, idk physically)
bug-reports 2020-05-20 03:29:27 I flew my biplane into one of the chonky rotors on the floating island and got my engines destroyed, but after I flew away I could still increase/reduce throttle and fly normally, just at a reduced speed. I have a roblox capture if you want it.
