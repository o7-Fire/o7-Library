creations-chat 2018-11-19 03:39:37 I looked over it really quick
creations-chat 2018-11-19 03:39:46 and it seems to be the amount of upvotes somebody gets on a post
creations-chat 2018-11-19 03:40:03 so if you looked in the creations page and pressed teh green arrow on my post
creations-chat 2018-11-19 03:40:09 Id likely get a higher designer rank
creations-chat 2018-11-19 03:40:15 same thing me to you
creations-chat 2018-11-19 03:47:15 thanks man xD
creations-chat 2018-11-19 03:47:22 though Im posting my next ship
creations-chat 2018-11-19 03:47:30 which should get upvotes for actually looking good
creations-chat 2018-11-19 03:47:44 if this one didnt look good in the way people were thinking of at the time
creations-chat 2018-11-19 03:47:48 though it is still pretty nice
creations-chat 2018-11-19 03:49:03 
creations-chat 2018-11-19 03:49:20 
creations-chat 2018-11-19 03:50:17 
creations-chat 2018-11-19 03:50:30 
creations-chat 2018-11-19 03:51:33 notice: the middle one is for the VTOL, the end one is the ship just now. Im working for designer rank, thanks for your reviews guys! ðŸ˜„
bug-reports 2018-11-19 04:55:18 I like this build
bug-reports 2018-11-19 06:23:58 its not the best in the world, but its very good and unique
bug-reports 2018-11-19 06:24:09 huh
bug-reports 2018-11-19 06:24:17 wow I actually like that very much man
bug-reports 2018-11-19 06:24:33 you can add engines on the sides and have varying effects counting on how open the wings are
bug-reports 2018-11-19 06:24:44 or could even, if you are up to it, add secondary wings with that sole function
bug-reports 2018-11-19 06:25:16 cool cool good work though Im looking forward to upvoting that when you post it on <#504436696021204992>
help 2018-11-19 06:25:44 water is tricky, but overall the same rules apply to move around
help 2018-11-19 06:25:52 you just need more power to do things
creations-chat 2018-11-20 04:52:57 raft thingies on side are a bit weird tbh
creations-chat 2018-11-20 04:53:13 si
creations-chat 2018-11-20 04:53:27 they still take one out of the smooth design of ths ship and back into minecraft
creations-chat 2018-11-20 04:53:50 If you could work it somehow without those it might increase upvotes it'd get mine for one
creations-chat 2018-11-20 04:54:33 huh nice
creations-chat 2018-11-27 00:55:38 where *are* the cylinders?
creations-chat 2018-11-27 01:02:17 w0 tank
creations-chat 2018-11-27 01:02:23 like ur st yle
creations-chat 2018-11-27 01:03:45 hey why are most of the roles based on chance knowledge mediocre but task consuming achievements and then the actual counting roles are voted on by masses of people building ugly crap
creations-chat 2018-11-27 01:04:08 so then good creations arent as good as just marketing  a lumpy block well
creations-chat 2018-11-27 01:04:37 should make a role for people who actually know what good design is
creations-chat 2018-11-27 01:04:51 that they can role people on creations for good design
creations-chat 2018-11-27 01:05:14 can be judges top 3 lower rank below
