bug-reports 2022-11-11 20:19:45 Do anyone know why i can't save my build?

I can save it while i'm still in the server, but if i leave and rejoin, i lost the save i made earlier
bug-reports 2022-11-11 20:34:57 Nvm, the problem come from the max data i can save, it didn't allowed me to go further than 2.1Millions on the 4 Millions said
bug-reports 2022-11-12 21:48:53 Creating big build ?
