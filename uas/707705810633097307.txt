plane-crazy 2020-07-16 23:19:55 then there are multiple creators
plane-crazy 2020-07-16 23:19:05 hmmmmm
plane-crazy 2020-07-16 23:18:35 well if the creators would be pro coders (i'm not so don't hire me as your coder) they could make whitelisting and have a toggle that lets players save your stuff or not and you could also have a toggle that prevents them from deleting blocks
plane-crazy 2020-07-16 23:16:46 nope not all whitelists do that
plane-crazy 2020-07-16 23:10:15 f you
plane-crazy 2020-07-16 23:09:44 can we add whitelisting to the game so ppl can help you build
