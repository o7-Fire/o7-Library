creations-chat 2022-08-25 22:18:07 ok, i will replace the wing with regular wing panels, not sure what you mean by big and goofy main gear, the main gear is supposed to be beefier compared to the nose gear because the main gear is supporting most of the weight
base game missiles may look big but its still smaller than custom missles
ill just remove the missiles for now
creations-chat 2022-08-25 22:22:32 is this better?

events-chat 2022-11-11 23:50:39 fun fact, even though motor torque is limited to 5, you can use a reduction gear to increase torque
events-chat 2022-11-11 23:56:43 also since you have to be able to get off the tracks, use a large wheelbase and large wheels if ur using wheels.
large wheelbase reducing manuverability but you dont need that anyways

events-chat 2022-11-12 17:31:35 does anyone know if this is okay
events-chat 2022-11-12 17:33:45 yea but the total torque doesnt exceed the limit
events-chat 2022-11-12 20:16:20 bruh no one told me there was no torque limit for wheels
events-chat 2022-11-12 20:16:48 its not a robot lmao
events-chat 2022-11-12 20:16:58 its called battlebots but they arent actual robots
events-chat 2022-11-12 20:17:09 combat vehicles???
events-chat 2022-11-12 20:17:50 torque rule seems fine to me
events-chat 2022-11-12 20:18:11 flippers can use pistons, suspensions, and springs
events-chat 2022-11-12 20:18:44 <@609921899585077296> üíÄ
events-chat 2022-11-12 20:19:07 nothing in particular
events-chat 2022-11-12 20:19:20 why cant i
events-chat 2022-11-12 20:19:40 as long as what i say isnt against the rules i can say what i want to say
events-chat 2022-11-12 20:20:48 rbk can you clarify in <#621452102618578964> that theres no torque limit for drive motors?
events-chat 2022-11-12 20:21:40 its an event in a lego game, its meant to be fun, so there are rules
events-chat 2022-11-12 20:21:45 its really that shrimple
events-chat 2022-11-12 20:22:37 theres a reason why drag races have power limits
events-chat 2022-11-12 20:22:56 im like 99% sure that most do
events-chat 2022-11-12 20:23:28 and teams have tried that, which is the reason why theres a power limit
events-chat 2022-11-12 20:24:01 smooth wheels when
events-chat 2022-11-12 20:24:14 with actual tire pressure
events-chat 2022-11-12 20:34:50 wider wheels are better right
events-chat 2022-11-12 20:34:53 more grip
events-chat 2022-11-12 20:34:57 less slip
events-chat 2022-11-13 01:00:51 <@466793357318815744> nickname: shredder bug
events-chat 2022-11-13 01:04:01 wdym
events-chat 2022-11-13 01:04:48 i think so
events-chat 2022-11-13 01:04:56 yes
events-chat 2022-11-13 01:04:59 you can do that
events-chat 2022-11-13 01:11:07 wait how
events-chat 2022-11-13 01:11:20 its double the power
events-chat 2022-11-13 01:11:30 huh
events-chat 2022-11-13 01:11:34 idk what that is
events-chat 2022-11-13 01:11:50 yes
events-chat 2022-11-13 01:11:56 no
events-chat 2022-11-13 01:12:10 maybe
events-chat 2022-11-13 01:13:16 ok
events-chat 2022-11-13 01:15:44 you cant
events-chat 2022-11-13 01:16:08 ?
help 2022-11-13 02:35:24 help
events-chat 2022-11-13 02:42:33 these things are hard to control
events-chat 2022-11-13 02:43:59 can i battle a bot in vip 1
events-chat 2022-11-13 03:08:38 you are allowed to add a detachable thing
events-chat 2022-11-13 03:08:52 rocket powered C-17
events-chat 2022-11-13 03:38:11 if you make a bot small enough, you can just hide here and the bigger bots will have a harder time getting you
events-chat 2022-11-13 03:41:12 fun fact, if you set gravity to 300, you can increase your weight without increase your mass
events-chat 2022-11-13 05:25:06 this might take a while
events-chat 2022-11-13 05:25:21 ill need to configure 64 different motors
events-chat 2022-11-13 17:58:28 please unban suspension
events-chat 2022-11-13 17:58:36 the ground is actually so damn bumpy
events-chat 2022-11-13 18:01:19 its especially noticeable at high speeds
events-chat 2022-11-13 18:04:00 how do i make suspension without using the banned blocks
events-chat 2022-11-13 18:06:38 im confused now since it says we can fold outside of the limit
events-chat 2022-11-13 18:07:39 i know but i need suspension for wheels
events-chat 2022-11-13 18:07:55 my bot will literally jump over the rails from the bumpiness
events-chat 2022-11-13 18:08:31 no
events-chat 2022-11-13 18:08:46 yea
events-chat 2022-11-13 18:09:15 i havent seen any wedge bots
events-chat 2022-11-13 18:09:21 which is interesting
events-chat 2022-11-13 18:09:37 its not glitching out
events-chat 2022-11-13 18:09:45 its just hitting the tiny bumps on the field
events-chat 2022-11-13 18:09:49 and jumping up
events-chat 2022-11-13 18:10:08 well yea cuz ur slow
events-chat 2022-11-13 18:10:11 no
events-chat 2022-11-13 18:10:33 what even is the point of banning suspension tho
events-chat 2022-11-13 18:10:56 well only 1 of the motors is used for forward/reverse
events-chat 2022-11-13 18:11:03 the only one is for turning
events-chat 2022-11-13 18:11:10 and the lone motor is unpowered
events-chat 2022-11-13 18:11:31 yes?
events-chat 2022-11-13 18:11:43 i need redundacy
events-chat 2022-11-13 18:11:57 evading
events-chat 2022-11-13 18:12:08 and possibly ramming into enemies
events-chat 2022-11-13 18:12:13 to send them flying
events-chat 2022-11-13 18:12:44 it makes the controls difficult
events-chat 2022-11-13 18:12:54 you have to use 2 hands to drive
events-chat 2022-11-13 18:13:24 if i increase my mass a ton (which the wheels can handle), i probably wont
events-chat 2022-11-13 18:13:29 no
events-chat 2022-11-13 18:13:39 if you call it something different
events-chat 2022-11-13 18:13:44 how would i know what it is
events-chat 2022-11-13 18:21:35 pc2 is a lie
events-chat 2022-11-13 18:47:46 its not completely flat
events-chat 2022-11-13 18:47:55 its bumpy enough to make my bot jump
events-chat 2022-11-13 18:49:34 i have 32 big 5x5 wheels
events-chat 2022-11-13 18:49:41 each wheel is 4 blocks wide
events-chat 2022-11-13 18:49:49 max speed and torque
events-chat 2022-11-13 18:49:56 so yea its gonna be bumpy
events-chat 2022-11-13 18:50:08 so i need some sort of suspension to smooth it out
events-chat 2022-11-13 18:50:27 yes
events-chat 2022-11-13 18:50:44 it is quite the big
events-chat 2022-11-13 18:50:54 yea please
events-chat 2022-11-13 18:51:07 why would u use suspension for weapons anyways
events-chat 2022-11-13 18:51:13 no
events-chat 2022-11-13 18:51:19 its all fuel beams
events-chat 2022-11-13 18:51:49 suspension is literally designed to be used for drive systems
events-chat 2022-11-13 18:52:22 is a magnet cannon a glitch
events-chat 2022-11-13 18:52:51 aint n oway
events-chat 2022-11-13 18:53:11 whats with the 51x51 size limit but folding outside the limit is allowed
events-chat 2022-11-13 18:53:41 true
events-chat 2022-11-13 18:53:58 smol boat
events-chat 2022-11-13 18:55:59 in the meantime, how do i make wheel suspension without using suspension blocks
events-chat 2022-11-13 18:56:12 im surprised u have no top armor
events-chat 2022-11-13 18:56:29 a javelin could easily blow that whole thing up
events-chat 2022-11-13 18:56:53 fun fact, your character is a weak point
events-chat 2022-11-13 18:57:08 so you should place the main pilot seat in the most armored position
events-chat 2022-11-13 18:57:35 ok because those 5 torque motors are able to fling a 500 ton battle bot
events-chat 2022-11-13 18:57:41 somehow
events-chat 2022-11-13 18:58:15 i wanna copy u so bad
events-chat 2022-11-13 18:58:33 except bigger and buffer
events-chat 2022-11-13 18:58:50 im gonna fold my bot so its bigger than the plot
creations-chat 2022-11-13 19:26:37 guh
events-chat 2022-11-13 19:48:45 isnt 2 beams more than 6 blocks tho
events-chat 2022-11-13 21:56:15 i never knew there was an expert server
events-chat 2022-11-13 22:08:44 <@466793357318815744> can i put max torque for a motor used for folding? it wont be moved during the match since its a locked motor
events-chat 2022-11-14 02:02:55 me
events-chat 2022-11-14 04:17:04 DANG thats huge
events-chat 2022-11-14 04:17:09 jeeez
events-chat 2022-11-14 04:20:31 man most of ur wheels dont even do anything
events-chat 2022-11-14 04:20:46 tf u mean
events-chat 2022-11-14 04:20:54 the ones on top dont do shit
events-chat 2022-11-14 04:21:03 at least mine all function
events-chat 2022-11-14 04:21:22 yes thats my point
events-chat 2022-11-14 04:21:27 thats the goal of my bot
events-chat 2022-11-14 04:24:19 <@466793357318815744> does the bot have to be above ground?
events-chat 2022-11-14 04:24:44 man u didnt specify
events-chat 2022-11-14 04:24:58 like underground bots
events-chat 2022-11-14 04:25:22 it like
events-chat 2022-11-14 04:25:26 is under the ground
events-chat 2022-11-14 04:25:55 ok
events-chat 2022-11-14 04:27:03 yes but ur gonna get ripped apart
events-chat 2022-11-14 04:27:07 so uh good luck
events-chat 2022-11-14 04:28:31 man that dont look like a pentagram
events-chat 2022-11-14 04:29:28 penta means five, nowhere in that is 5
events-chat 2022-11-14 04:29:32 
events-chat 2022-11-14 04:30:41 get in vip 2
events-chat 2022-11-14 04:31:17 ur bot small and tall
events-chat 2022-11-14 04:31:56 those goofy ahh wheels
events-chat 2022-11-14 04:32:17 your spinners barely do anything
events-chat 2022-11-14 04:32:44 most of the time they push me back 2 feet
events-chat 2022-11-14 04:33:05 because ur swords are scary
events-chat 2022-11-14 04:33:17 exactly
events-chat 2022-11-14 04:33:27 only the ones that do damage are scary
events-chat 2022-11-14 04:34:08 what
events-chat 2022-11-14 04:34:12 why not
events-chat 2022-11-14 04:34:18 what is grapes
events-chat 2022-11-14 04:34:23 go to your roblox settings
events-chat 2022-11-14 04:34:26 privacy
events-chat 2022-11-14 04:34:36 turn who can invite to private server to everyone
events-chat 2022-11-14 04:34:50 get over here
events-chat 2022-11-14 04:34:53 lemme do it for you
events-chat 2022-11-14 04:35:20 how many wheels do yalls bots have
events-chat 2022-11-14 04:35:53 how big is each
events-chat 2022-11-14 04:36:08 how wide
events-chat 2022-11-14 04:36:16 ok
events-chat 2022-11-14 04:36:24 i have a little more wheels
events-chat 2022-11-14 05:34:49 was taking a fat dump
creations-chat 2022-11-14 05:38:13 this shit basic af
events-chat 2022-11-15 03:08:52 <@466793357318815744> my bots top speed on flat ground is 310, in the arena its 280 ish, acceleration also suffers in the arena
events-chat 2022-11-15 03:42:21 so uh yea i need suspension
events-chat 2022-11-15 03:56:40 literally
events-chat 2022-11-15 03:56:58 dude its literally bumpy
events-chat 2022-11-15 03:57:19 for the most part, no, since you wont be going fast enough to notice
events-chat 2022-11-15 03:58:39 its not just my bot tho, i saw another dudes bot also glitching, albeit not as much
events-chat 2022-11-15 03:58:55 its a combination of high speed and no suspension
events-chat 2022-11-15 03:59:19 no because then that wouldnt be the max motor settings
events-chat 2022-11-15 03:59:54 if the maximum motor speed is 50 and max torque is 1000, then you can fairly assume that the game is designed to handle that power
events-chat 2022-11-15 04:00:03 roblox is just ass
events-chat 2022-11-15 04:00:37 the reason its glitching is probably because of the amount of motors in it
events-chat 2022-11-15 04:00:59 yes
events-chat 2022-11-15 04:01:09 im not giving up the motors tho
events-chat 2022-11-15 04:01:25 it doesnt glitch on my end so i honestly dont really  care
events-chat 2022-11-15 04:19:05 i mean i get launched too
events-chat 2022-11-15 04:19:11 its not a unique problem
events-chat 2022-11-15 04:19:44 why would it fix it tho
events-chat 2022-11-15 04:21:16 okay but that also means i wont be able to push other bots
events-chat 2022-11-15 04:22:50 which have reduced torque compared to smaller wheels
events-chat 2022-11-15 04:23:00 each is 4 blocks wide
events-chat 2022-11-15 04:23:32 
events-chat 2022-11-15 04:24:26 and my bot still takes 3 full seconds to do a 360 turn
events-chat 2022-11-15 04:25:25 its not possible for me to ever get to that tho
events-chat 2022-11-15 04:25:33 because of the way the bindings are set up
events-chat 2022-11-15 04:25:42 the total torque is only going to be 32k
events-chat 2022-11-15 04:26:24 on flat ground, probably 80% at least
events-chat 2022-11-15 04:27:25 so you know how when you have a motor at max torque and 50 speed, itll instantly spin at max speed when you push the key right? well my wheels dont
events-chat 2022-11-15 04:28:35 nah what
events-chat 2022-11-15 04:28:38 how
events-chat 2022-11-15 04:28:59 im going 300+ speed on flat ground in this heavy ass bot
events-chat 2022-11-15 04:29:19 no
events-chat 2022-11-15 04:29:38 why would i lock it
events-chat 2022-11-15 04:30:09 locked motors dont stay locked when ur moving it
events-chat 2022-11-15 04:30:23 yes
events-chat 2022-11-15 04:30:30 oh wiat
events-chat 2022-11-15 04:30:36 maybe i should lock them
events-chat 2022-11-15 04:30:48 locked motors act weird tho
events-chat 2022-11-15 04:53:11 yousurf made a spinner bot that can fling my plot sized monstrosity with 200k fuel, at like 2k speed
events-chat 2022-11-15 04:53:26 and somehow the motor torque is 5 and speed is 40
events-chat 2022-11-15 05:08:51 same thing lma
creations-chat 2022-11-15 05:50:48 literally the same aside from slightly bigger wing
events-chat 2022-11-15 05:56:35 <@466793357318815744> bot name: bot violator, date: 2nd, class: spinner

events-chat 2022-11-16 03:56:13 and its super buggy now

creations-chat 2022-11-20 00:48:43 they are just as capable for the role they were designed for and are used for
creations-chat 2022-11-20 00:52:46 mig29s are not flankers
creations-chat 2022-11-20 00:55:21 the nato reporting name given to the su-27 is Flanker, the nato reporting name given to the mig-29 is the Fulcrum, so no, the mig-29 is not a Flanker

contest-chat 2022-11-24 02:33:55 Is it just those 2 props
events-chat 2022-11-24 22:32:53 apparently its the shape of the blade or weight distribution or something
events-chat 2022-11-24 22:32:59 honestly makes no sense
events-chat 2022-11-24 23:41:43 no it isnt

creations-chat 2022-11-28 03:54:57 fuselage looks weird
creations-chat 2022-11-29 04:21:57 ive been stuck on this idk how to make better
im thinking about making intakes wider at the front but i dont want it to look fat
creations-chat 2022-11-29 04:25:12 i honestly dont know what to do aside from cleaning up some gaps and bits
creations-chat 2022-11-29 04:27:59 forgot to say but its supposed to be something around the size of a gripen or hal tejas
creations-chat 2022-11-29 04:31:46 ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è V3 on top V2 on bottom, V2 nose just looks fat
<@883063424614006878> gripen is like 1 block longer
creations-chat 2022-11-29 04:39:08 der a bit different
creations-chat 2022-11-29 04:47:47 i think the size is okay, i need to figure out how to angle the cockpit and raise the pilot seat slightly
creations-chat 2022-11-29 05:00:34 1.8 wide at the base, 1 wide at the tip
creations-chat 2022-11-29 05:07:30 i dont want to make any significant increases in size, im willing to lengthen it by a few blocks maybe, but i cant make any drastic changes like making the fuselage any more than 3.5 blocks wide (including intakes), so the wider i make the cockpit, the smaller the intakes
creations-chat 2022-11-29 05:15:12 now that i think about it, im basically going for a downsized f-35 with 2 engines and canards
help 2022-11-30 02:01:49 i want a nozzle like this that is 1.5 wide

contest-chat 2022-11-30 04:45:54 does the HH-60A have the sensors or no?
contest-chat 2022-11-30 04:46:01 these things

contest-chat 2022-12-02 00:44:02 and contest still has 5 days
contest-chat 2022-12-02 00:45:09 if he made 80% of his heli before the contest started and finished the rest after the contest started, then he should delete that 80% and rebuild it
contest-chat 2022-12-02 00:45:16 the other 20% he can keep
contest-chat 2022-12-02 00:45:25 really is quite the simple

creations-chat 2022-12-21 19:12:57 link to the 5.1 feet
creations-chat 2022-12-21 19:15:50 look at the source tho
a roblox character is 2 blocks tall, according to rickje, a block is 2.5 studs, making a character 5 studs tall, that source is wrong
creations-chat 2022-12-21 19:17:56 thats not a roblox site tho
creations-chat 2022-12-21 19:20:25 5 studs tall
even though its amazon, its not an official amazon answer, its like a forum, anyone can answer
creations-chat 2022-12-21 19:23:46 i think the assumption that a character is 5.5 studs tall created the discrepancy
0.7 meters = 1 block in length

creations-chat 2023-01-08 03:02:30 assuming u have no vertical wing panels, make sure the center of mass isnt behind of center of lift, for yaw control, just motorlock 2 control surface into each other, one deflects up and one deflects down to create extra drag on one side to yaw
hidden vertical wing panels will work but they create extra drag and are not needed

creations-chat 2023-01-10 05:09:52 in order for an airliner in pc to be truly "roscale" the walls would have to be made of disconnectors or trapdoors or something similar

creations-chat 2023-01-11 06:18:41 in plane crazy its nearly impossible
creations-chat 2023-01-11 06:25:59 i was researching the possibility of building a roscale 777X in pc, the walls would have to be made of disconnectors or trapdoors, so you'd need a bunch of angle locks, and theres basically no space to hide the motorlock except for maybe in the nose or in the very back assuming i want actually usable cargo space, the seats in pc are also way to be for economy, 10-abreast economy seats on the 777X are 18 inches wide, a seat in pc is 27.5 inches wide, and even if you managed to get everything mentioned above, youd still have to make the cockpit which would be horrendous consider the blocks wouldnt line up if its a custom sized cylinder, and youd still have to somehow weasle in space to fit the landing gear with landing gear doors, and it would just be a nightmare to make
creations-chat 2023-01-11 06:31:17 i didnt think about control surfaces but that seems like it would make a lot of drag

creations-chat 2023-01-11 23:10:03 <@654837629874864140> i know ur probably going for the dome window b-17 look but it'd probably easier to do a conventional cockpit and windows, with the high wing, id recommend adding a little bit of anhedral maybe 5 degrees, also would recommend like 10-15 degrees of wing sweep since its jet powered
idk about the apu
creations-chat 2023-01-12 02:34:28 <@782168042229858304> how did you get it to take/save pics automatically? The Google cars will take pictures automatically like 1 per second or something I don‚Äôt know

creations-chat 2023-01-14 22:56:58 is this ok for a bf109
creations-chat 2023-01-14 22:59:26 alternative
creations-chat 2023-01-14 23:07:29 ok but his is roscale, yours isnt
creations-chat 2023-01-14 23:38:18 gap is 1 block too big
creations-chat 2023-01-14 23:42:54 that would probably be like less than a block wide lol
creations-chat 2023-01-15 01:28:00 is this good enough
creations-chat 2023-01-15 01:51:03 bruh how else am i supposed to improve it
creations-chat 2023-01-15 01:53:22 it looks clean but it doesnt look good
creations-chat 2023-01-15 01:55:40 i mean 3 months is pretty long
creations-chat 2023-01-15 01:58:32 im struggling so hard
creations-chat 2023-01-15 02:02:29 idk its kinda hard when the scale of the whole build is small
creations-chat 2023-01-15 02:05:27 nah i just dont like the f-117
creations-chat 2023-01-15 02:10:07 i dont see how its ironic, i dont rate others builds based on difficulty, i rate based on accuracy and if its custom, a bunch of other factors
creations-chat 2023-01-15 02:13:57 how do i hide the trails
creations-chat 2023-01-15 02:26:48 i used reference images the whole process through wdym
creations-chat 2023-01-15 02:28:53 because i cant cam lock it and i cant fit angle lock so i have to resort to using wedges

creations-chat 2023-01-15 02:33:50 dry the air
creations-chat 2023-01-15 02:38:47 why is this random 0 lock bf109 better than mine
creations-chat 2023-01-15 02:42:03 you got the order mixed up
creations-chat 2023-01-15 02:45:10 
creations-chat 2023-01-15 03:00:15 i will figure out how to remove the exposed motor without using magnetlock, its just as aerodynamic as every other pc build, and if you threw it into a wind tunnel it would fly bc it has wings dunno what u mean by turbulent foil, if you mean turbolent flow, that isnt a problem at low speeds, consider a paper airplane, idk what you mean by center of gravity bc it flies perfectly fine, WBL 183.4???, I will add exhaust exit later, the in-game prop engine is literally a piston engine, just a different type of piston engine (thats ricks fault im not doing his work for him), ahm ackshually its not a cube its a rectangular prism ü§ì, and yea air is still gonna flow over it, air still flows over a box if you throw it, front landing gear is ricks fault as well
so your response is ass basically üíØ
creations-chat 2023-01-15 03:04:12 if you read the message, the only useful piece of info you gave me is the exhaust exit thingies
creations-chat 2023-01-15 03:06:21 i literally have made improvements to it wdym
creations-chat 2023-01-15 03:10:44 maybe it is, but its still better than the few roscale bf109s out there
creations-chat 2023-01-15 03:13:01 thats literally not roscale
creations-chat 2023-01-15 03:15:22 theres literally only like 2 (maybe 3) roscale bf109s in pcc, and i didnt see any on youtube
<@398216801592410113> yea, because its not roscale
creations-chat 2023-01-15 03:17:59 its actually slightly larger than roscale lol
creations-chat 2023-01-15 03:22:34 dude mine is like barely bigger its close enough

<@456226577798135808>
IRL BF109 specs:
12.786 blocks long
14.179 blocks wingspan
3.714 blocks tall
MY BF109 specs
13 blocks long
16 blocks wingspace
4 blocks tall (might be more idk)
creations-chat 2023-01-15 03:24:43 <@456226577798135808> that guy is about the same height as the fuselage, if not slightly taller, my planes fuselage is 2 blocks tall, the same height as my character standing up
creations-chat 2023-01-15 03:28:19 the only reason the arms are sticking out is because of roblox animations making the arms stick way out to the side, as you can see in your photo, the guys arms barely fit inside the plane, if he were to literally T-pose then he wouldnt fit in the plane either
creations-chat 2023-01-15 03:31:00 sorry bro but this doesnt count as roscale
creations-chat 2023-01-15 03:35:07 my avatar is closer to a real human than a blocky style avatar is, a cat-sized cat avatar would be roscale to a real life cat
help 2023-01-15 03:36:37 canards and thrust vectoring both work
creations-chat 2023-01-15 03:45:51 idk what definition ur using but 1 stud = 0.28 meters accoring to roblox, a block is 2.5 studs according to rickje, therefore a block is 0.7 meters, using simple arithmetic and wikipedia specifications, you can determine the amount of blocks a certain build needs to be sized to
creations-chat 2023-01-15 03:48:51 <@773474989751664640> this is the definition im using
creations-chat 2023-01-15 04:05:37 very detailed
creations-chat 2023-01-15 04:34:45 stud to irl ratio doesnt change
the avatar you use doesnt change build scale
creations-chat 2023-01-15 04:37:59 that doesnt change the fact that a block in pc is equivalent to 0.7 meters irl
creations-chat 2023-01-15 04:40:15 <@690957737391161434>, note the definition of roscale, the avatar size literally doesnt matter, since roscale is just relating studs to real life units of measurement
creations-chat 2023-01-15 04:45:24 <@838973460884488233> cool concept but it looks like it can only toggle when the wheels arent steering
creations-chat 2023-01-15 05:42:26 shaders make the build appear/look better, does not make the build itself better
creations-chat 2023-01-15 05:45:10 eh, its okay ig since its mini but it could be much better
creations-chat 2023-01-15 05:47:39 making something mini in pc thats huge irl isnt a great idea
creations-chat 2023-01-15 05:50:02 id recommend building a new one, and make it bigger, even if you try to make a bunch of improvements on ur plane rn, you need a solid foundation to get good results
creations-chat 2023-01-15 19:24:26 can someone find a good roscale bf109, I need to see what im up against
creations-chat 2023-01-15 19:28:05 doesnt count as roscale unfortunately
also bf109 doesnt have 4 bladed prop? i might be wrong on that
creations-chat 2023-01-15 19:31:32 it doesnt have to be 1 wide ig but the dimensions have to at least be right
creations-chat 2023-01-15 19:39:44 norway! that means i can use the giant prop engine instead of the medium one!!! more power = more speed
contest-chat 2023-01-15 20:54:03 the intakes are interesting

creations-chat 2023-01-28 18:36:40 
creations-chat 2023-01-28 18:38:42 its also what provides the lift and allows the thing to actually fly in level flight

events-chat 2023-01-29 02:18:08 i want to revamp and repurpose the drive system i used on my battlebot
events-chat 2023-01-29 02:20:38 simple overview
4 columns with 8 wheels each, so 32 total
each wheel is a 5x5 cylinder 4 blocks wide
each wheel is powered by 2 motors, 1 for forward and back, 1 for turning
problems with this system, the stacked motors effectively halves useable torque leading to a very noticeable acceleration time, there is no suspension, so even on flat ground, not all the wheels are contacting the ground at all times so traction is reduced
events-chat 2023-01-29 02:26:31 first improvement i can make is increase wheels from 8 to 9 by placing them slightly outside the plot space
creations-chat 2023-01-29 03:04:24 i wouldnt say so

help 2023-03-02 02:56:52 aim
help 2023-03-02 02:56:57 why
creations-chat 2023-03-02 03:03:20 whether or not its "bad" depends on who you ask, but we can all agree that its worse than most modern fighter jets
creations-chat 2023-03-02 03:12:59 it is both negative and inevitable
idk what you consider to be a "negative", but in fighter jet design, almost everything is a trade-off, and we value some aspects more than others for fighter jets. So yes, an f-14 used to be cheaper to buy and maintain than an f-22 today, but the capabilities of the f-22 are unmatched by the f-14
TLDR;
Fighter jet combat effectiveness is probably the most important aspect to consider, more so than anything else

also everything is going to have negatives no matter what, an f-14 just has more negatives and less positives than an f-22
creations-chat 2023-03-02 03:23:19 "the tomcat is better than the f22 and f35 because it was made in the 70s so stealth and survivability doesnt matter" ^
creations-chat 2023-03-02 03:33:23 tomcat used to be good, but now it isnt
creations-chat 2023-03-02 03:35:40 my whole point is that its no longer good, which essentially relates back to the original prompt
