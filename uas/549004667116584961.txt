creations-chat 2021-12-25 04:57:33 how many days have you lived
creations-chat 2021-12-25 05:02:50 you are about to make the average days in a humans life to go from 30,000 to 30,000 because the amount of people that contribute to the average is so big an outlier like 5,636 days doesnt change the average
creations-chat 2021-12-25 05:04:57 (30,000*8000000000+5,636)/8,000,000,001 = 30000
