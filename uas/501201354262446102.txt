bug-reports 2020-01-08 10:04:16 servos have a seizure if the speed is set to over 2 (well, over 1 but 2 is the limit i can call it "stable" as such)
the-dump 2021-01-20 08:47:23 baot
help 2021-05-01 04:37:58 Anyone know if its possible to make some sort of stabiliser to cancel out any tilting on parts? (eg making a car where the body doesnt roll with the chassis)
edit: i dont wanna cheese it with helium blocks or manually doing it with powered motors/servos, i wanna have it be as mechanically automated as possible)
