creations-chat 2020-09-01 13:49:17 My tank also experiences physics throttling
creations-chat 2020-09-01 13:49:35 Maybe I need to update it to use beams instead of blocks
creations-chat 2020-09-01 13:50:05 No
creations-chat 2020-09-01 13:50:18 There's a few parts of it with 1x7 and 1x4 beams
creations-chat 2020-09-01 13:50:22 But mostly 1x1
creations-chat 2020-09-01 13:51:12 And maybe part of the reason is cuz it uses the motor and wedge tank treads
creations-chat 2020-09-01 13:53:36 I don't notice throttling when i use hover thrusters
creations-chat 2020-09-01 13:57:44 oh ok well idk about that

the-dump 2021-05-29 11:18:05 From what we perceive no they don't
the-dump 2021-05-29 11:18:10 But perhaps they do
the-dump 2021-05-29 11:18:38 True
the-dump 2021-05-29 11:20:15 True there are like a ton of sun like stars with earth like planets
the-dump 2021-05-29 11:20:25 Not just in the milky way but also in other galaxies
the-dump 2021-05-29 11:20:29 Like the Andromeda Galaxy
the-dump 2021-05-29 11:21:24 Most of them
the-dump 2021-05-29 11:21:52 But there should at least be 1 sentient species out there
the-dump 2021-05-29 11:21:58 nope
the-dump 2021-05-29 11:22:41 Sure
the-dump 2021-05-29 11:22:45 I'm interested

the-dump 2021-05-29 11:27:05 I'm rather busy in overpowering my spaceship
the-dump 2021-05-29 11:27:11 To make it the ultimate combat ship
the-dump 2021-05-29 11:27:15 anyways
the-dump 2021-05-29 11:27:53 But what caused the end of almost all species across the galaxy?
the-dump 2021-05-29 11:28:36 Nvm there's too much possibilities on what happened
the-dump 2021-05-29 11:29:08 But I have a feeling that we are the first sentient species in the galaxy
the-dump 2021-05-29 11:29:13 If not, one of the first
the-dump 2021-05-29 11:29:42 There could be like 20 other planets with the same technological level as we do
the-dump 2021-05-29 11:30:19 more or less

creations-chat 2021-08-01 09:23:00 The dreadnought isn't even an original design, it's an sby ship. So there would be multiple people building the dreadnought.

reply to <@!852934999824269322>: It's ugly. Even if it works fine and does it's job without fail, if it looks comparable to a starter plane then it sucks and people will downvote it. That's how <#384025409945337856> works.

**Its a torture chamber, deep underground your "girlfriend's" house**

She wasn't there to care for you. She was manipulating you to give her your trust. She wanted to make you her lab rat. As she climbs with you with what seems to be tools straight from a bsdm club, the next thing you hear.
