creations-chat 2020-04-20 06:00:40 I think you need to go back to flight school.
creations-chat 2020-04-20 06:01:18 Colour it yellow, maybe then I'll upvote it
creations-chat 2020-07-01 18:15:07 I have no idea what really happened here

But I doubt it's anything less than inappropriate.
creations-chat 2020-07-01 19:55:24 Not enough forks
creations-chat 2020-07-09 07:44:52 Any ideas on how to build interlocking moving wheels for German heavy tanks? They're a headache to figure out.
help 2020-08-30 14:29:47 Question: How to make an oscillating turret?
creations-chat 2021-04-20 18:14:23 Help. My sanity. This almost took up more blocks than my mech. Why.

C712 Longsword, is anything missing?
creations-chat 2021-04-20 18:16:24 I know

But it's causing my potato computer problems

I really ought to upgrade it if I want to build anything beyond 1500 and not freeze my entire screen
creations-chat 2021-04-20 18:19:42 I'm not sure how exactly potato it is, but I'm running full graphics and my build keeps slowing down.

At least this is better than my last laptop which could only do minimum graphics.
creations-chat 2021-04-20 18:21:49 Is it possible for your build to not slow down when exceeding the 1000-block mark on full graphics, for any computer?

Or is it a perfectly normal thing I'm not used to?

***Reminder to self: Get a full upgrade before attempting to lose more sanity off lag from building an Excubitor-class or whatever***
creations-chat 2021-04-20 18:26:06 I'm guessing the people here with the Master Badges are mostly only able to do so because top-notch computers?

<@!670939038999511041> Donno how exactly potato-ish this one is, but I've got a few extensive steam games downloaded on my laptop which *might* be why. Is that how it works?
