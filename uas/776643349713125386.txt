creations-chat 2022-08-24 09:36:37 It is a car
creations-chat 2022-08-24 09:41:46 I connected it to my best tutorial jet. It is made to be airdropped off the jet then activate parachutes which disconnect. the image is the car after being airdropped. The features are:
1. Off-road mode
2. Racing mode (Makes it stick to the ground and not fly off)
3. Turret armed with guns and missiles
4. Hover thrusters so it can go on water
5. A nitro boost
6. Detachable Parachutes
7. Racing mode can be used as a T-bag function
8. Self destruct mode
