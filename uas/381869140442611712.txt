help 2021-09-03 17:19:02 And don't try to sell me that BS "he didn't mean to" his vehicle was **specifically designed** to crash servers. Every damn time he spawned it, my $2,500 home built gaming PC SHIT itself and crashed. I have never had issues with it, before or after.
help 2021-09-03 17:21:55 If you think testing my vehicles and minding my own business means I messed with him, I guess you could go with that argument.
help 2021-09-03 17:22:17 Clearly.
help 2021-09-03 17:23:09 I was testing a new tank at the time, but I never once bothered him. It may have been laggy, but I never did anything to him. His vehicle crashes games when he rams someone with his vehicle, in this case, my large tank.
help 2021-09-03 17:23:59 no, it slowed the server to a stop. Everyone in the game was having serious lag issues
help 2021-09-03 17:24:48 like I said, this happened 2 months ago and I'm over it already
help 2021-09-03 17:25:28 as he should be, he did it to himself
help 2021-09-03 17:26:19 On the outside, yeah. But it crashed the whole game and everyone in it.

help 2021-09-03 17:32:42 how
help 2021-09-03 17:32:45 Never messed with him

creations-chat 2021-09-19 02:59:50 ðŸ¤· cry about it, ig. you said it first. <:KEKW:670310537300672528>
creations-chat 2021-09-19 03:02:06 I do have to say that i couldnt get the landing gear to retract into the wings or body because that would require insane amounts of motor locking and i din't really know how to do that well yet. The landing gear on it is a mess in general.

<@!527653676022628353> What can i do to make it look more like it?
creations-chat 2021-09-19 03:05:37 **no.** Alof of the stuff on it is experimental and it took me too long to make. Someo f the angles on it aren't avaliable on a larger version
creations-chat 2021-09-19 03:07:40 If i could make curvier parts or longer wedges then i could give it a shot.
creations-chat 2021-09-19 03:10:51 Canopy?
creations-chat 2021-09-19 03:15:10 Alot of things aren't acheivable in this game without excessive motor locking which i wanted to avoid. Fun fact, The front of the aircraft is a failed beechcraft barron, i went with the vision jet because of how similar it looked in that state.
