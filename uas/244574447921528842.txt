creations-chat 2020-12-29 01:56:05 the copterbot in particular took a shit ton of tweaking, along with me coming up with the copterstick concept specifically for it, in order for me to actually build it. my original goal was to just build something like ROBOT that could fly semi-legitimately
help 2020-12-29 02:17:28 i need some help in jetstream
creations-chat 2020-12-29 03:51:26 none of them are shitposts. the ones i posted before were just old things i made in my save files, this one was just made on stream
creations-chat 2020-12-29 03:58:37 theyre bad to you. finding all the wedges to make the perfect shape is incredibly difficult, and most of the robots i posted took a lot of effort to get in that shape, except the tech demos, which were proofs of concepts

creations-chat 2022-02-22 04:05:43 its so i could put half wedges on the side of the body to make it look more aerodynamic. plus, it looks cool
creations-chat 2022-02-22 19:59:07 shut up asshole
creations-chat 2022-02-22 20:05:03 its <#504436696021204992> not <#384025409945337856>-be-a-jerk. you offered no feedback, no actual criticism, just "your build looks shit."
creations-chat 2022-02-22 20:10:43 wym "example" lmao, i just called you out for being an ass, and judging by your response, you are
creations-chat 2022-02-22 20:19:46 damn you played the "youre mad lol" card. guess youre better than all of us.
