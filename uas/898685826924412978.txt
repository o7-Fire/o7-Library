creations-chat 2021-12-20 17:34:43 These people are saying if u have red green or white on ur mech then u copied 7 different people i dont understand the logic here
creations-chat 2021-12-21 00:47:10 Bro I upvoted bc of the doors lmao
events-chat 2022-01-27 18:18:22 wait so for the mech even, you have to have a mech that does NOT fly? I can't tell bc mech battles are supposed to have flying mechs. Who walks in a mech battle.
events-chat 2022-01-27 18:22:47 So, idk if u have ever had real mech battles but NO ONE walks.
events-chat 2022-01-27 18:23:53 im not entering lol
events-chat 2022-01-27 18:29:07 This was my mech but it specializes in flying. Never heard of a mech battle with no flying lmao.

events-chat 2022-01-27 18:35:55 ohhhh
events-chat 2022-01-27 18:36:12 I see what ur mindset is
events-chat 2022-01-27 18:40:03 History class time: Mech fighters and mech battles were originated from popular animes "Gundam". Gundam is a futuristic mech fighting anime with several airborn mechs. Most popular mech players "shinki" "Mashu" have all come from anime scene. This video PR is a totally different mindset of mech battles and was focused on a more "realistic" scene. Flying mechs come from the variety of animes. Thats why most mech dc servers have a lot of users with anime pics. History class is over thank you for coming. (:
events-chat 2022-01-27 18:40:20 lol
events-chat 2022-01-27 18:41:22 so the host was trying to make a more "realistic style" of mech fighting rather then a ton of sweats flying around
