help 2023-03-20 00:49:19 Does anyone know how i stop my 747-8 landing gear from wiggling? I used to motor2s to hold each one at max torque but it still wiggles.

help 2023-03-20 00:53:46 Should I use a normal motor with the lock setting on? it might work but it requires more key binds
bug-reports 2023-03-20 01:03:18 This has been a bug for a while, but motor2s constantly like to act as if they have no torque, regardless of their torque setting when being used as landing gear. Another bug I would like to report (might not be a bug) is that when you power up your engines, get out of your chair and get back on it, and increase or decrease the throttle, it will automatically go to it's unpowered setting, and either throttle up or down from there as you use it. I have found this to be an annoying issue, as when I leave my chair mid-flight, and get back in, I would go in for a landing, but as soon as I try to slowly decrease throttle, it suddenly powers down, and i have to throttle back up again, which puts me into a stall. Please fix these bugs. Thank you!
bug-reports 2023-03-20 03:44:00 It isn't a bug, and is a common occurance. This feature will be fixed in Plane Crazy 2 when it comes out, however.
bug-reports 2023-03-20 03:44:16 yep
bug-reports 2023-03-20 03:44:30 I bet the release is going to get delayed again
bug-reports 2023-03-20 03:44:41 It still i
bug-reports 2023-03-20 03:44:44 is*
bug-reports 2023-03-20 03:44:58 There's another bug I'm having
bug-reports 2023-03-20 03:45:06 Where motor2s don't work under speed.
bug-reports 2023-03-20 03:45:21 My control surfaces on my 747 aren't functioning correctly.
bug-reports 2023-03-20 03:45:32 They just fling around.
bug-reports 2023-03-20 03:45:53 That's different
bug-reports 2023-03-20 03:46:10 rotating motor2s at a certain speed or above will make it fly off
bug-reports 2023-03-20 03:46:24 which is a different thing being fixed in the never occuring plane crazy 2.
creations-chat 2023-03-20 03:47:19 how do you upload images.. Do I need a certain role or something?
bug-reports 2023-03-20 03:53:00 What is your reasoning of hostility?
bug-reports 2023-03-20 03:54:26 I'm sure there's no need to violently respond with this much anger and hate.
bug-reports 2023-03-20 03:55:14 Why would you even care to respond to what I've said if it bothers you so much?
bug-reports 2023-03-20 03:55:50 It's useless, knowing I won't "Shut the fuck up!!!".
bug-reports 2023-03-20 03:56:27 I hope you are aware of everyone's first amendment rights, as I'm exercising mine.
bug-reports 2023-03-20 03:57:32 by saying "Shut the fuck up" will prolong your pain and suffering of my voice.
bug-reports 2023-03-22 00:09:16 Roblox needs to fix the damn game.

bug-reports 2023-03-22 02:23:23 If it is possible, I would request that you fix issues that I am having with motor2s on my 747-8. If anyone could verify with me that it's not a glitch, rather a problem with my build, I'll give you a private server link to help me with that.
bug-reports 2023-03-22 02:27:21 Well I just joined and am waiting for level 3 so I can request a rank.
bug-reports 2023-03-22 02:29:31 I'm legible for Aeronautical Engineer Master V, but I didn't join the discord when I joined the game.
help 2023-03-22 02:35:57 Can someone join my private server to help me determine if the Motor2 Issues I am encountering are actual bugs or if it's a problem with my build? I'll send the link to the first volunteer.
