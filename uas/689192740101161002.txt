help 2022-04-23 11:38:28 welp ive tried a variety of things and i cant find any possible way to make these two parts in a way that looks good or accurate, so ill probably just skip them. its not a big deal either, since they arent present in every model of the A10.
creations-chat 2022-04-23 12:35:26 any feedback? will probably be adding some decals
creations-chat 2022-04-23 12:37:27 i cant do any on the front but will probably do that for the back

creations-chat 2022-04-23 12:56:24 ok
creations-chat 2022-04-23 14:46:10 first of all fuck off
creations-chat 2022-04-23 14:47:55 and also FINE. ill show yall what it looks like with a shitty, blocky landing gear. i just know that it wont fit, it wont look good, and it wont flow well. just saying, its going to be entirely exposed from the bottom, side, and front profiles of the plane if its a custom made one, but fine. sometime tomorrow or today, ill do it, post a photo, and prove that it looks like crap. okaaay?
creations-chat 2022-04-23 14:51:02 i figure i want it to look better than a floating cylinder so i want an actual steering mechanism, and it has to look accurate.
creations-chat 2022-04-23 14:57:22 in my mind, i just dont understand why everyone wants the front gear to be custom instead of the two back ones, and heres why:

regular landing gear block-
-can steer
-is only two blocks in size
-looks accurate
-doesnt ruin the flow of the underbody
-doesnt force me to cram it in an akward way that can completely ruin the side, front, and underside profiles unlike the custom one
-doesnt need an incredible amount of effort despite not seeing it at all during flight unlike the custom one

custom landing gear-
-looks cool if you do it right???
-idk gold star for effort or some sh*t
creations-chat 2022-04-23 14:59:07 i will definitely do that but i dont get why everyone thinks its so important lmao <:Thonk:509498568982134816>
creations-chat 2022-04-23 15:00:58 thats what im saying! its not even visible for 90% of the time so i feel that its not nearly important as fixing the other parts of the plane
creations-chat 2022-04-23 15:09:40 ah yes, low effort, not like ive spent countless hours making and improving it using plentiful feedback, let alone these other builds which are definitely high effort and took them a lot more time than my build. sure. fine. 
<:OkBuddy:652567204453154816> <:stuff:908917207986208828>
ive got to go now, so ill see yall later.
help 2022-04-24 09:51:42 uh... you dont know this??? 
the motor 2 is automatically set to follow your mouse when you place it
make sure that the servo setting is turned off if its not following ur mouse cuz it turns on the keybinds
help 2022-04-24 10:01:34 lol
help 2022-04-24 16:44:44 ive been trying to do this angle lock for an entire hour, and i have no idea why its not working. the motor immediately locks and i cant move it even though its locked and powered, and the whole motor lock column is tnt blocked as well as an anchor block at the top... whats wrong???
help 2022-04-24 19:21:25 guys my A10 custom landing gear is causing a lot of shaking and wobble
help 2022-04-24 19:21:33 how fixxxx
help 2022-04-24 19:23:12 there no suspension cuz its literally impossible to put a spring on it lmao
help 2022-04-25 11:48:08 so i need help with two different things on my A10:
help 2022-04-25 11:48:12 custom landing gear
help 2022-04-25 11:48:36 and that thing above the control panel that has holographic sights
help 2022-04-25 11:49:18 dont know how tf to fit a custom landing gear in here... also the back two are custom but are shaking the whole build
help 2022-04-25 11:49:32 the back landing gear btw
help 2022-04-25 11:50:36 this is the whole canopy, idk how exactly to make that holographic sight thing. the sights themselves are just text boxes, but the metal structures have me stumped.
creations-chat 2022-04-26 16:49:45 WAIT I ACCIDENTALLY POSTED IN <#384025409945337856>
ok i deleted before downvote bombed lmao
creations-chat 2022-04-26 16:52:10 btw i cant make the body slimmer, because it needs to be 3 wide to be able to have all the motor locking inside it without anything poking out. other than that, idk whats wrong with the nose and engines so pls elaborate more (i say this bcs i asked in the chat before and ppl said it looks fine)
help 2022-04-26 17:01:57 IT IS ALMOST DONE! im honestly kinda exited and really proud, cuz i also learned how to angle lock from this. i only have two questions left before i consider it "finished": 
-how do i fix the wobbling pitch in flight
-any feedback? 
(btw i fixed the holographic sights cuz they didnt look good)
yes, this is a repost because i accidentally posted in <#384025409945337856>

help 2022-04-26 17:49:32 i get what youre going at for some of those, but here is the problem for the rest:
-i cant make the cockpit smaller because of the switch from piston mechanism to just a trap door. also, ive spent quite a bit of time perfecting it so it is balancing between functional and accurate, so i cant really make it better.
-might be able to fix wings being bumpy, the only reason the engines are there is for extra speed
-i wont be changing the engines unless someone posts another design, since i have asked many times but noone says how to fix the shape.
-not sure whats wrong with the back, but i guess ill try to "fix" it
-cant make custom landing gear for a couple reasons, but the biggest problems are that there is absolutely no room for a front landing gear, and having only the back two as custom makes it tilt downward. also, custom landing gear makes it shake for some reason, and suspension isnt helping.
-not sure what you mean by overlocked, since i literally used the feedback from other people to give it the completely different shape it now has on the front. also, i made sure to not waste a single INCH of motor lock tower space, so i am almost certain that it was as space efficient as possible. if i still had an older image, you can definitely tell the difference.

TLDR: ill fix the wings and some other stuff but most of the feedback has already been done or is just not possible for my design
