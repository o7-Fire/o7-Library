plane-crazy 2020-06-22 01:23:31 Alrighty then, Thanks aqilo
plane-crazy 2020-06-22 01:23:14 <:BigThink:414161178671972353>
plane-crazy 2020-06-22 01:22:38 They're not in any category
plane-crazy 2020-06-22 01:22:31 Hmmm, so how do I use the new summer event items I found
plane-crazy 2020-06-22 01:22:11 <:BigThink:414161178671972353>
plane-crazy 2020-06-22 01:21:59 Wait so if you even find the summer event items you have to buy this to be able to use them?
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 04:58:10 <:blobHypersweat:362231928784683009>
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 04:58:04 Well thanks again, imma go suffer testing the CoM and CoL alignment with my aircraft
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 04:57:32 Oh, alrighty then
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 04:56:49 Final thing, how do I counter center of mass change if plane is designed to drop things I.E. bombs
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 04:56:03 Now that's a bruh moment
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 04:55:19 But not so much with planes that contain 1000+ blocks?
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 04:54:18 <:blobHypersweat:362231928784683009>
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 04:54:17 Bloody christ
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 04:53:02 <:blobHypersweat:362231928784683009>
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 04:53:01 Bruh, so on top of precision placement I also need proper quantity of control panels
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 04:51:35 No no, in terms of how many CoL blocks there are compared to how many CoM blocks there are
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 04:50:23 CM > CL means less control?
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 04:50:06 ??
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 04:49:42 But if I change the location of my CM doesnt that mean CL won't be affected thus resulting in less control of your air craft?
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 04:48:30 That's so much work then
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 04:48:25 <:blobHypersweat:362231928784683009>
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 04:47:32 Bruh if I have to do it with care does that mean I have to constantly test my plane until I get CM and CL properly aligned?
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 04:46:45 In terms of that they both move together
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 04:46:30 Unless they stay the same upon fold
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 04:46:10 Also how do you guys align center of mass and center of lift if plane can fold <:Thinkeyes:635568088623874110>

plane-crazy 2020-06-20 04:35:51 Is using infinite fuel against any rules of ranks?
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 04:35:05 Idk what you guys call it
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 04:34:59 Or glitch zone
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 04:34:57 The death zone
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 04:34:54 Oh yeah
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 04:34:21 Or nah
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 04:34:16 While the ship is controllable?
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 04:33:48 I cry in the corner of my ship as it flings me out at 3000 sps
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 04:33:23 I run
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 04:32:09 REeEEEEeEeE
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 04:32:07 Look at how many controls there are
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 04:31:04 Not
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 04:31:03 Absolutely
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 04:31:01 No
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 04:30:39 Then I clearly haven't played this game long enough smh
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 04:30:17 <:Thinkeyes:635568088623874110>
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 04:28:50 To my left and right reeeee
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 04:28:44 By custom flaps do you mean this?
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 04:26:20 Lol
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 04:24:26 Oh what
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 04:23:24 Or no
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 04:23:21 Hover car I think
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 04:23:07 <:Thinkeyes:635568088623874110>
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 04:20:56 But can you use it to counter unaligned center of mass and center of lift?
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 04:19:07 <:BigThink:414161178671972353>
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 04:18:58 Hmmmmm....
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 04:18:53 Or does it mean, you cannot use a thruster to control the plane's orientation?
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 04:17:52 Does rule two of ranks mean that, if your center of mass and your center of lift are not aligned you're not permitted to cheese such system by the means of using thrusters to counter down pitch or up pitch?
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 04:16:17 May I ask a question concerning ranks rules?
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 04:12:55 Hmmm
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 00:06:48 Not my build but oh god
plane-crazy 2020-06-19 23:15:42 Lol
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 21:57:52 Lol
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 18:58:57 Nice build and now I run
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 18:58:49 Lmao
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 18:46:05 What's the difference between motor 1 and motor 2?
