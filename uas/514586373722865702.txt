bot-central 2021-12-07 14:17:40 ?rank
bot-central 2021-12-07 14:17:51 !rank
events-chat 2022-04-30 21:27:10 <@466793357318815744> can I get a bot to build please
events-chat 2022-04-30 21:28:54 Ok
events-chat 2022-04-30 21:32:21 LETS GOOOOO
events-chat 2022-04-30 21:32:37 Under cutter time
events-chat 2022-04-30 21:33:04 Hydra is still pretty good
events-chat 2022-04-30 21:33:20 Question is cutters on flippers allowed
events-chat 2022-04-30 21:34:35 I'm happy with mines
events-chat 2022-04-30 21:46:52 Pc isn't really good at handling battlebots
events-chat 2022-04-30 21:47:16 I'm in a league
events-chat 2022-04-30 21:48:22 Well when you get flung at 500mph it gets a bit 
Odd
events-chat 2022-04-30 21:51:34 They get pretty bad yes
events-chat 2022-04-30 21:51:56 Fbs?
events-chat 2022-04-30 21:52:12 Full body spinners?
events-chat 2022-04-30 21:54:29 I'm gonna have fun with this one
events-chat 2022-04-30 21:55:03 I've been having trouble making under cutters but that won't stop me
events-chat 2022-04-30 21:56:23 No ill just put a cylinder under the weapon
events-chat 2022-04-30 21:57:33 <@601591777618690108> build this ðŸ’€
events-chat 2022-04-30 21:57:54 It is
events-chat 2022-04-30 21:58:14 They built it for huge
events-chat 2022-04-30 22:01:38 https://www.facebook.com/Whyachi/videos/3006562839558824/
events-chat 2022-04-30 22:02:22 So configurations are aloud
events-chat 2022-04-30 22:04:18 Deep 6 is easy to counter
events-chat 2022-04-30 22:05:06 Yea but recoil exist
events-chat 2022-04-30 22:06:44 Use its recoil against it like in the show
events-chat 2022-04-30 22:13:11 Shatter is pretty good
events-chat 2022-05-01 01:10:49 Question dose walkers get a bonus like in the show?
events-chat 2022-05-01 01:11:05 Ok
events-chat 2022-05-01 01:12:22 That's the older one
events-chat 2022-05-01 01:14:43 Big
events-chat 2022-05-01 01:14:58 That was before the reboot
events-chat 2022-05-01 01:15:15 Then it became a circle
events-chat 2022-05-01 01:19:49 I have a feeling someone is gonna motor stack there weapon
events-chat 2022-05-01 02:59:29 Oops made a mistake
events-chat 2022-05-01 02:59:45 Now I have this dumb thing on the top
events-chat 2022-05-01 03:11:38 The description of that bot is 
Pain and suffering
events-chat 2022-05-01 03:11:53 Including against deep 6
events-chat 2022-05-01 03:12:48 The funny vertical spinner that had a good beginning
events-chat 2022-05-01 03:13:32 It also exploded a mini bot
events-chat 2022-05-01 03:14:12 Yep
events-chat 2022-05-01 03:14:38 Season 1-6 of the reboot
events-chat 2022-05-01 03:17:43 I mean
events-chat 2022-05-01 03:18:32 Make aegis
events-chat 2022-05-01 03:20:45 Mad catter is good
events-chat 2022-05-01 03:22:17 The back of valkyire is gonna be a pain to make
events-chat 2022-05-01 03:23:57 By motor stacking?
events-chat 2022-05-01 03:24:14 Copperhead
events-chat 2022-05-01 03:24:32 Make gigabyte
events-chat 2022-05-01 03:24:47 Nvm
events-chat 2022-05-01 03:25:03 Blade is good
events-chat 2022-05-01 03:25:23 Thicc bar
events-chat 2022-05-01 03:25:55 What about sawblaze
events-chat 2022-05-01 03:28:10 Build atom 94
events-chat 2022-05-01 03:33:38 Yea
events-chat 2022-05-01 03:34:28 Tip speed of 2012 nice
events-chat 2022-05-01 03:35:30 Yes
events-chat 2022-05-01 03:35:47 Or the one with two rakes
events-chat 2022-05-01 03:38:45 I don't think so because shatter is a hammer not a hammer saw
events-chat 2022-05-01 03:48:36 Good luck making the weapon
events-chat 2022-05-01 03:48:51 Witch doctor is a good bot
events-chat 2022-05-01 03:49:07 Yep runner up
events-chat 2022-05-01 03:53:42 Mine has issues that I'm to lazy to fix
events-chat 2022-05-01 03:54:12 That fight was kinda a let down
events-chat 2022-05-01 03:56:22 It's a puncher
events-chat 2022-05-01 03:56:37 A vertical spinner that moves forward
events-chat 2022-05-01 03:57:11 Hydra is taken
events-chat 2022-05-01 04:00:00 Rusty didn't do that well........
events-chat 2022-05-01 04:01:07 Recoil is gonna kill someone
events-chat 2022-05-01 04:02:50 Was it a melty brain?
events-chat 2022-05-01 04:06:40 Not unless you run single motor
events-chat 2022-05-01 04:10:37 However if the main bot is out than your out the mini bot isn't normally the main bot
events-chat 2022-05-01 04:19:49 Suspension weapons
events-chat 2022-05-01 04:20:05 Like hammers  probably
events-chat 2022-05-01 04:21:12 Then use single motors?
events-chat 2022-05-01 04:21:40 Single motors also have tank steering
events-chat 2022-05-01 04:29:58 Yea
events-chat 2022-05-01 04:30:14 Including on drills
events-chat 2022-05-01 04:33:15 I think its one of the banned blocks
events-chat 2022-05-01 04:33:32 Yep
events-chat 2022-05-01 04:34:02 Punchers sometimes need them to prevent them from doing weird things
events-chat 2022-05-01 04:37:19 Basically
events-chat 2022-05-01 05:17:36 Why not 10
events-chat 2022-05-01 05:19:46 Why not 10-100?
events-chat 2022-05-02 11:47:22 Yet scorpios won against tombstone
events-chat 2022-05-02 13:27:22 You don't need it
events-chat 2022-05-02 13:27:45 You can use motors 2 and motor 1
events-chat 2022-05-02 13:28:06 Motor 1 are used to power the lifter or flipper
events-chat 2022-05-02 13:29:33 And motor 2 to give the lifter/flipper a max angle
events-chat 2022-05-02 20:59:02 Thats also very powerful
events-chat 2022-05-02 23:43:47 Make it fold
events-chat 2022-05-02 23:45:21 <@466793357318815744> what bots are left on the wheel
events-chat 2022-05-02 23:54:06 Can I take one of the rejected ones?
events-chat 2022-05-02 23:55:08 Because apparently huge is too hard to make
events-chat 2022-05-02 23:56:15 
events-chat 2022-05-02 23:56:35 No but I think two people rejected it
events-chat 2022-05-02 23:57:43 Smeeee is pretty good in pc
events-chat 2022-05-02 23:58:02 If built right
events-chat 2022-05-03 00:00:34 Oh no
events-chat 2022-05-03 00:01:03 But what if someone gets riptide <:trollface:775024642104229898>
events-chat 2022-05-03 00:05:37 Anyway can I get a re spin
events-chat 2022-05-03 00:08:15 Can I take huge?
events-chat 2022-05-03 00:08:31 Yes
events-chat 2022-05-03 00:08:47 Yes yes
events-chat 2022-05-03 00:09:03 Ok
events-chat 2022-05-03 00:26:32 Has the funny wheel made its decision
events-chat 2022-05-03 00:30:07 Oh thank god
events-chat 2022-05-03 00:30:22 I'll take it
events-chat 2022-05-03 00:30:38 A hammer drum quite a unique weapon
events-chat 2022-05-03 00:31:35 6
events-chat 2022-05-03 00:31:51 Yea
events-chat 2022-05-03 00:32:10 Needed custom wheels
events-chat 2022-05-03 00:32:35 The issue with that is its gonna mess with the under cutter big Time
events-chat 2022-05-03 00:33:32 We still got rotator
events-chat 2022-05-03 00:34:01 Which looks like both Funny undercutter and over head
events-chat 2022-05-03 00:37:34 Yea
events-chat 2022-05-03 01:58:24 Yes please
events-chat 2022-05-03 01:58:40 I don't want my roblox to have a aneurysm
events-chat 2022-05-03 11:03:51 Question can I get ballast for the weapon since I need to balance it
events-chat 2022-05-03 17:39:17 That's a bit much
events-chat 2022-05-03 17:41:35 Why do you need all of that motor locking?
events-chat 2022-05-03 19:19:30 Body in progress
events-chat 2022-05-04 03:26:35 Nonthing
events-chat 2022-05-04 03:27:50 Yes
events-chat 2022-05-04 03:28:10 But the ballast limit is screwing me over at the moment
events-chat 2022-05-04 17:23:46 Ok I'm just gonna say this 
It's kinda dumb how weapons can only be at incredibly low tourqe and 40 speed but 75% why people are flinging is because of motor stacking
events-chat 2022-05-04 19:38:14 Still need to get my switch back finished
events-chat 2022-05-04 19:39:26 Can't
events-chat 2022-05-04 23:43:10 
events-chat 2022-05-04 23:43:25 Idk but it looks like you got replaced?
events-chat 2022-05-04 23:45:41 <@466793357318815744> why did you do him like that
events-chat 2022-05-05 01:19:59 I 
I cant join a sever
events-chat 2022-05-05 01:34:18 ðŸ˜”
events-chat 2022-05-05 23:52:01 Hi
events-chat 2022-05-06 00:42:52 Wait
events-chat 2022-05-06 00:44:00 <@466793357318815744> wasn't <@660501140722548746> the last competitor
events-chat 2022-05-06 00:44:16 To be entered
events-chat 2022-05-06 00:44:34 I'm doing some good old test fights
events-chat 2022-05-06 02:01:28 Because I think he wanted to enter
events-chat 2022-05-06 02:01:47 So can they fill in for the people who can't make it
events-chat 2022-05-06 02:32:15 Man I can't wait till Witch doctor launch a piece of bot at you and kill you lol
events-chat 2022-05-06 12:02:34 Magnet drive 
Conveyor drive 
Normal drive 
shuffler 
Walker
events-chat 2022-05-06 12:04:30 You can just motor stack
events-chat 2022-05-06 12:05:19 Instead of having one motor for each side of the weapon you can have two
events-chat 2022-05-06 12:05:35 So it will double the power
events-chat 2022-05-06 12:06:28 Like all Together because I have 4
Which obviously cause this
events-chat 2022-05-06 12:11:16 I did the cylinder trick
events-chat 2022-05-06 12:11:35 Double my Bots power
events-chat 2022-05-06 12:14:21 Also mad catter has like 3 but it glitches
events-chat 2022-05-06 12:14:37 Mine doesn't besides when pc dies
events-chat 2022-05-06 12:16:07 <@466793357318815744> I'm gonna make the sane weapon configuration they made for gruff 
And for huge
events-chat 2022-05-06 12:18:09 Lol
events-chat 2022-05-06 12:18:25 He's kinda scared of my switch back I think
events-chat 2022-05-06 12:20:34 Oh
events-chat 2022-05-06 12:21:07 Tbf I think he's somewhat scared of my bot because it's a 500 pound drum spinner with 4 motors
events-chat 2022-05-06 12:27:39 Well flinging is gonna happen
events-chat 2022-05-06 12:27:56 That's why dart rules exist
events-chat 2022-05-06 12:29:03 Rule wise or
events-chat 2022-05-06 17:41:12 But the difference between your bot and mine is that your big spinner goes 4k
events-chat 2022-05-06 17:41:41 Mine only can hit like 1k
events-chat 2022-05-06 17:42:06 Ironically my drum can actually get to speed with motor stacking
events-chat 2022-05-06 17:54:44 Yea but the power though
events-chat 2022-05-06 18:08:39 Sorry was switching between lunch and class
events-chat 2022-05-06 18:09:17 
events-chat 2022-05-06 18:12:58 It's depending on the shape of the drum
events-chat 2022-05-06 18:15:46 Nice
events-chat 2022-05-06 18:42:27 So uh about that
events-chat 2022-05-06 18:42:43 Rank is a pain
events-chat 2022-05-06 20:20:20 Can we see it when it isn't in build mode?
events-chat 2022-05-06 20:22:22 Ok
events-chat 2022-05-06 20:28:31 Looks pretty good
events-chat 2022-05-06 20:38:56 Isn't lag machines banned
events-chat 2022-05-06 20:43:10 My phone can handle pc battlebots
events-chat 2022-05-08 21:51:49 Ham
events-chat 2022-05-09 23:59:09 I mean
events-chat 2022-05-09 23:59:25 If you put cutters in the beak 
It will kill
events-chat 2022-05-10 01:16:22 <@466793357318815744>
events-chat 2022-05-10 17:37:13 I kinda don't see the whiplash part
creations-chat 2022-05-11 03:27:16 Is that the link in creations if so get that out of there I'm gonna need some bleach
creations-chat 2022-05-11 03:29:13 <@466793357318815744> I beg of you please
creations-chat 2022-05-11 03:32:04 Yes please the link is to something no one should see please
events-chat 2022-05-15 16:40:48 It's actually 500
events-chat 2022-05-15 16:52:27 He did way to much to build a simple bot
events-chat 2022-05-15 16:53:07 Bro this tournament itself is a joke
events-chat 2022-05-15 17:32:38 Bro 
This tournament is a shit post
The host aperntaly think damage is the biggest factor 
People are using gravity
events-chat 2022-05-15 17:34:08 Everything
events-chat 2022-05-15 17:34:29 They allowed gravity sliders instead of giving more ballast
events-chat 2022-05-15 17:34:51 Aperntaly most of the people don't know how the hell single motors works
events-chat 2022-05-15 17:36:31 "Them how do I turn" 
Like what bro it isn't rocket science
events-chat 2022-05-15 17:37:30 I'm just talking about how bad this tournament is
events-chat 2022-05-15 17:41:00 Way to much motor locking
events-chat 2022-05-15 17:42:04 The whiplash has way to much its a box with a lifter and a spinner and wedges
events-chat 2022-05-15 17:45:20 That's not having time and determination that's just called being unnecessary
events-chat 2022-05-15 17:47:46 More likely the bracket was randomized
events-chat 2022-05-15 17:48:58 That's because the spinner is 4 sticks on a circle
events-chat 2022-05-15 17:49:41 The rules just makes no sense
events-chat 2022-05-15 17:50:24 That's its self righter
events-chat 2022-05-15 17:50:54 Why do a battlebots pc tournament if nobody has a understanding of battlebots
events-chat 2022-05-15 17:51:44 He was defending his point
events-chat 2022-05-15 17:52:04 So rbk but without the accident
events-chat 2022-05-15 17:52:20 No battlebots in general
events-chat 2022-05-15 17:52:54 Shouldn't give him the right time bend the rules
events-chat 2022-05-15 17:53:28 Man just mad
events-chat 2022-05-15 17:54:56 The rules are bad so I don't blame them
events-chat 2022-05-15 17:56:01 They banned that
events-chat 2022-05-15 17:56:34 A beta had like 30 tourqe and people got pissed
events-chat 2022-05-15 17:57:22 Some bots got bonuses that makes no sense
events-chat 2022-05-15 17:57:59 Not like they have any proof of you cheating
events-chat 2022-05-15 17:59:36 What about capt shredder and it's bonus
events-chat 2022-05-15 18:00:36 My drum was heavier than the spinner that's why I need to motor stack
events-chat 2022-05-15 18:02:07 My spinner weights more than 800 blocks
events-chat 2022-05-15 18:02:23 I need to motor stack to keep it going
events-chat 2022-05-15 18:02:52 Motor stacking
events-chat 2022-05-15 18:03:22 It's like a steroid
events-chat 2022-05-15 18:04:06 Probably
events-chat 2022-05-15 18:04:31 Unfortunately because of captain shredder bs I didn't made it far
events-chat 2022-05-15 18:07:25 LETS GOOO
events-chat 2022-05-15 18:16:52 (Bad tournament)
events-chat 2022-05-15 18:22:14 He good
events-chat 2022-05-15 18:22:47 But you didn't win did you <:clueless:942802644043464734>
events-chat 2022-05-15 18:26:53 
events-chat 2022-05-15 18:27:23 That's my point
events-chat 2022-05-15 18:29:02 Basically 4 sticks on a circle isn't dose much I don't understand why you didn't built a disk
events-chat 2022-05-15 18:29:33 Indeed
events-chat 2022-05-15 18:29:52 That's a lifter/self righter
events-chat 2022-05-15 18:30:57 A disk is way better in power and damage and its more realistically accurate
events-chat 2022-05-15 18:33:31 Nope 
But disk are probably the better choice
events-chat 2022-05-15 18:36:22 Holy shit they found you?
events-chat 2022-05-15 18:37:14 Why
events-chat 2022-05-15 18:37:34 Just up the ballast limit
events-chat 2022-05-15 18:37:58 We did a loop hole with motor stacking as I recall there was no rule about that in the rules
events-chat 2022-05-15 18:38:33 Then why did I got ass fucked when I did it
events-chat 2022-05-15 18:39:01 Also I think they did it against yeti
events-chat 2022-05-15 18:39:16 Jrst will win
events-chat 2022-05-15 18:41:04 Ya need to fix your rules
events-chat 2022-05-15 18:41:34 <@466793357318815744> so you got proven wrong
events-chat 2022-05-15 18:42:56 Because lifting in pc is pain it won't lift so you have to up the tourqe
events-chat 2022-05-15 18:43:15 Starts talking like he's trying to sing rap god lol
events-chat 2022-05-15 18:44:43 
events-chat 2022-05-15 18:44:59 Sure buddy
events-chat 2022-05-15 18:48:29 I'm pretty sure they take off the paw

events-chat 2022-05-15 23:45:13 It would of been the reboot season 1-6 so you can't enter
events-chat 2022-05-15 23:45:40 The judge
events-chat 2022-05-15 23:47:55 Comparing irl battlebots to pc battlebots is hard to do
events-chat 2022-05-16 00:59:33 
events-chat 2022-05-16 00:59:49 Knife would win
events-chat 2022-05-16 03:01:02 Hehe
events-chat 2022-05-16 11:40:38 E
events-chat 2022-05-16 11:42:03 This sever isn't really 
The brightest
events-chat 2022-05-16 11:47:27 Because it's funny 
At this point its for entertainment
events-chat 2022-05-16 12:51:46 I think so
events-chat 2022-05-16 17:43:51 Bro for the last time 
They are powered
events-chat 2022-05-16 17:44:10 Do we need more arrows
events-chat 2022-05-16 17:47:02 
events-chat 2022-05-16 18:23:31 True
events-chat 2022-05-16 18:36:24 Like how rbk forgot that mad catter has lifters
events-chat 2022-05-16 19:51:42 Probably because the rules are just ass
Like your iq
events-chat 2022-05-16 19:58:13 We just wanted to shit on you guys and attack did so
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:00:38 I think those 3 understand that the rules wasn't the right choice fir oc battlebots
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:00:54 I think those 3 understand that the rules wasn't the right choice fir oc battlebots
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:15:17 This man us asking a simple question
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:15:43 And they do it better
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:18:18 True
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:27:48 I got pissed because capt shredder got a unfair bonus
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:28:53 Yea
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:29:09 A tourqe bonus 
Because it's a fbs but only the top spins
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:29:25 Captain shredderator
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:29:41 My drum is heavier than the weapon
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:29:57 My drum weights 800 blocks or above
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:32:25 If the whole shell spun I would of been fine with it
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:35:18 Ok so rbk wanted the bots to be heavier to prevent glitching instead of adding a bigger ballast limit he allowed gravity
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:35:34 That is the rule that makes no sense
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:36:52 That's how rbk won the last tournament
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:37:08 He used gravity on day 1 and won
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:37:25 Ik
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:40:38 At least the arena didn't stayed
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:41:26 Basically
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:42:32 It also suppress flippers
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:43:09 And ruins the point of lifters
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:43:30 Lol
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:44:31 Ye
events-chat 2022-11-14 02:38:33 Ye

events-chat 2022-11-18 02:39:57 Ooooo it works hehe
events-chat 2022-11-18 02:40:00 Ima do it
events-chat 2022-11-18 02:40:26 I wonder though
events-chat 2022-11-18 02:40:31 Will the gear be worth it?
events-chat 2022-11-18 02:40:47 Because since the tourqe limit is so low the weapon might have spin up issues
events-chat 2022-11-18 02:41:03 I'm just gonna put armor for the gear housings
events-chat 2022-11-18 02:41:26 Put kill bales on top of it
