creations-chat 2020-09-07 21:02:17 how does this look
creations-chat 2020-09-07 21:03:59 how is that relevant to my question
creations-chat 2020-09-07 21:05:32 yeah it's still wip
creations-chat 2020-09-07 21:05:39 haven't finished the back yet
creations-chat 2020-09-07 21:06:39 ok well what i've showed you isn't wip
creations-chat 2020-09-07 21:06:44 i've only shown you the front
creations-chat 2020-09-07 21:08:05 my guy you need to back off
creations-chat 2020-09-07 21:09:36 yeah thanks for 'helping me' by telling me in getting a bit full of myself <:PepeLaugh:697130830081818634>
creations-chat 2020-09-07 21:09:46 aight well if you want me to remove them i can
creations-chat 2020-09-07 21:10:37 you want to know why i have wedges on my plot?
creations-chat 2020-09-07 21:11:39 you were acting like you were above me and that i was lucky to talk to you when you responded to my question with another completely irrelevant question <:pain:644301805534183464>
creations-chat 2020-09-07 21:13:02 so what every question you ask should be answered immediately?
creations-chat 2020-09-07 21:13:38 again if i ask a question first it's not too outrageous to think that i might want my question answered first
creations-chat 2020-09-07 21:14:30 you said 'instead of saying why' which implies you wanted me to answer your question first
creations-chat 2020-09-07 21:14:55 you could have just either answered my question or told me you didn't have the answer to my question THEN asked your question
creations-chat 2020-09-07 21:15:30 anyway this is ridiculous and i don't want to argue with you about the rudeness of questions <:MyDolphinIsntWorking:552912733008429081>
creations-chat 2020-09-07 21:16:37 but i didn't <:pain:644301805534183464>  you started it with 'getting a little full of your self there'
creations-chat 2020-09-07 21:16:41 and anyway
creations-chat 2020-09-07 21:16:44 why are you continuing it?
creations-chat 2020-09-07 21:16:50 it doesn't matter
creations-chat 2020-09-07 21:16:52 bye bye
creations-chat 2020-09-07 21:19:05 also besides the fight what's wrong with my mech <:pain:644301805534183464>
creations-chat 2020-09-07 21:19:45 the voting doesn't seem to think so
creations-chat 2020-09-07 21:20:55 i mean everything you see there isn't wip
creations-chat 2020-09-07 21:21:07 the only wip bits are the parts you don't see
creations-chat 2020-09-07 21:22:14 that was a mistake <:PepeLaugh:697130830081818634>
creations-chat 2020-09-07 21:22:37 the foot thingies are basically just a pair of wheels on the back of the feet which you can't see anyway
creations-chat 2020-09-07 21:24:05 for all intensive purposes it's finished
creations-chat 2020-09-07 21:25:12 and anyway the exposed joints on the arms are something i basically can't change without messing up the design
creations-chat 2020-09-07 21:26:13 let me show you the basis for the mech
