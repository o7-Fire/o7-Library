creations-chat 2021-04-02 19:45:42 Does the wedge count as 1 block of height too?

creations-chat 2021-04-29 20:39:05 mate, this seems too big
creations-chat 2021-04-29 20:49:17 is 1 or 2 layers of control surfaces enough to control a big-ass plane?
creations-chat 2021-04-30 06:56:47 will this be enough to control a big Xian H-6 bomber plane
creations-chat 2021-04-30 07:01:56 what are those things
creations-chat 2021-04-30 07:07:25 like these?
creations-chat 2021-04-30 07:10:02 im 99 % sure using control surfaces would be way easier to make the wings
creations-chat 2021-04-30 07:19:22 yeah, i used that vid to make the custom control surfaces, but (i think) due to the size of the wings it probably wont work
creations-chat 2021-05-01 10:08:58 how should it be? cockpit fully made of glass or with some default material? (Xian H-6 bomber, reference model: https://battlefield.fandom.com/wiki/Xian_H-6?file=BF4_xian1.png)
