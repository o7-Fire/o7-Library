cmon man thats WAY too far.
Besides, its literally ONLY a banana. why are you getting so mad-
creations-chat 2022-04-03 00:35:17 mk i wasnt aware, ill start posting serious things????
((and yes i read rules.))
creations-chat 2022-04-03 00:39:55 I know I know I am. I also posted a banana car and that doesnt break the rules?
creations-chat 2022-04-03 00:41:59 yes? how does it not count as a "Car" just because it doesnt have a BRAND or isnt a "TECHNICAL" car in your book doesnt mean it cant class?
creations-chat 2022-04-03 00:44:02 it literally DRIVES and has more than 4 wheels, im talking about the "Battle Bot Banana Build" that I made. also what the about 6 wheel jeeps???
AND NO I did not ignore the first part, I just had to create a general statement
creations-chat 2022-04-03 00:46:10 so you're gonna blatently ignore the part where i said "Banana Car" not banana????
creations-chat 2022-04-03 00:48:48 artxlc I never said it WASNT low effort??? and Charizard. if you go further up you will find the car
creations-chat 2022-04-03 00:51:12 go WAY further back bruh also art, How did I repost?
creations-chat 2022-04-03 00:56:32 its a battle bot loosely based on a banana (Colour scheme and certain placements) and Art, I agree
woah cool your beans bro. I never said it wasnt low effort
creations-chat 2022-04-03 00:58:53 cmon, tell me when I said it was high effort. take a screenshot it. Go on.

Also you're getting mad over a banana. My friend you might want to rethink your life choices

I did read the rules.
I literally stated that in what I said?
creations-chat 2022-04-03 01:01:30 1. no im not 30 2. Yes you got mad over the banana originally 3. What can I do about it????

I DID READ THE RULES ARE YOU BLIND
creations-chat 2022-04-03 01:03:48 damn bro now you resorting to that? run out of points????
also I have mentioned SEVERAL times I read the rules.
creations-chat 2022-04-03 01:05:57 "dozens of others" I've only submitted a few creations and actually, I spend time on the serious ones (Which are really the ones i submitted except for the 2 banana's)

Alx has a point????
creations-chat 2022-04-03 01:09:13 y e s

creations-chat 2022-04-03 01:31:20 "so like **WHEN** am i getting my warning/ban"
creations-chat 2022-04-03 01:36:13 nearly. Main problem is I dont / didnt get mad, and my serious builds arent low effort (maybe to your standards??? but most of them are my first time building those genre of things)
creations-chat 2022-04-03 01:39:16 ok fair enough, that was literally the most low effort build BUT in general most of my other builds arent low effort
creations-chat 2022-04-03 01:41:27 but how?? I was stating that I had READ the rules???

also yes I did
creations-chat 2022-04-03 01:44:03 who said I wanted to be banned????? also doesnt the nerd gif count as a meme....

F1L3, Damn. I mean, I suppose???

Art. why are you talking, being mad over a banana????
