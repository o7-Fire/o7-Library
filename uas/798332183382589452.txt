creations-chat 2023-07-05 22:37:31 <@885774611424358410> the cage is a good touch but it has too many layers one or two at most would look well
creations-chat 2023-07-05 22:39:53 If u want missile defense add a spinning “radar” (trails/ladder) it works like a charm to throw off missiles. instead of tanking the damage with possible destruction to the build, it’ll redirect the middle somewhere else.
creations-chat 2023-07-05 22:42:04 Oh so ur looking for effectiveness and design, that concept is for effectiveness, looks shit

creations-chat 2023-07-11 00:34:11 LMAOOOO <@934821788725162024>
help 2023-07-11 00:35:31 There’s more wing panels in the back creating drag, causing the behind to fall slower than the front. If u add horizontal wing panels in the front it should even it out. Hope that helps
help 2023-07-11 00:37:22 Probably bc u messed around with the ballasts
help 2023-07-11 00:37:27 Personally I don’t like using ballasts
creations-chat 2023-07-15 01:02:44 <@915471910991720499> add some max ballast on there so it doesn’t get all jumpy
