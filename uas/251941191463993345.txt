creations-chat 2019-02-23 20:40:23 My own fictional build: Rocket Artillery

A massive long-range rocket launcher (holds 12 rockets) mounted on a heavy 8x8 chassis. 

The dual purpose high speed rockets, powered by 2 super rocket engines each, can seek out targets anywhere on the map (and can even be fired from behind cover, as they travel along a curved trajectory). They fire all at once so this weapon can also be used to swarm aircraft.

The vehicle itself can travel at up to speeds of 200~, has good off-road capabilities, and can pivot in place.

A compact personal aircraft modified as a gunship:
It has 6 hardpoints (two underneath each wing , one on the cockpit,  and another under its belly). It is currently equipped with a gun turret, 4 rockets, and a long-range guided missile

Fairly agile but weak to fast enemy airplanes. Strong against land vehicles and ships.

Max Speed: 80

creations-chat 2019-09-17 06:28:09 btw u can reduce the tilt by decreasing max-angle of rotation for the 2 motors controlling its pitch.

Cant completely eliminate swaying due to how the motor controlling roll is always rotating whenever the plane changes its direction oof
creations-chat 2019-09-17 06:38:49 Got the sway from the autmatic swivel-engine down a bit, at the cost of turn radius tho :C At least it **woorks**

creations-chat 2020-01-18 08:03:29 <=======] (boat)
   ^

Try putting some control-engines at the sides here
creations-chat 2020-01-18 08:04:04 The closer they are to the tip of a boat, the faster the turning wuld be
creations-chat 2020-01-18 08:04:30 Oh woops, i just meant engines facing the sides. They're only used for steering lele, unlike the main engines u have powering the boat forward
creations-chat 2020-01-18 08:07:33 oh shiet. Hmm i remember water was tough as hell to move in. I think all u can do atm is to put even more of those steering engines, and crank em on to on/off mode so they'll hit full-power instantly
creations-chat 2020-01-18 08:08:21 Make sure only one side's engines are activated at a time lol, else they cancel each other out so u dont turn (if that's what happned)
creations-chat 2020-01-18 08:10:21 XD yea if ur boat goes crazy
creations-chat 2020-01-18 08:10:57 Dont become cookie 🍪

One of the first experimentations of explosive bombardment via plane, this bomber is outfitted with two defense turrets and heavy-bombs to take the fight to the enemy homeland. 

Top speed: 410, and is able to barrel roll and loop.
