plane-crazy 2020-07-21 21:49:23 but do they fly?
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 21:48:51 what is the point of having them
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 21:48:44 because if not
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 21:48:39 do the planes work?
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 19:28:18 e
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 19:27:56 fuel tank wing panels
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 19:27:46 fuel tanks in wings
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 19:27:42 Fuel tanks in wings
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 16:59:07 tiny F6F looking bois
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 16:58:44 rick turn yourself into a pickle
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 16:38:10 amirite
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 16:38:07 lazy]
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 16:38:05 rick? more like
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 16:35:41 it would be a nice feature
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 16:35:31 Because if not
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 16:35:26 Do fuel tanks catch fire when you shoot them or not?
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 13:44:08 it's probably that
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 13:44:04 Because if your torque is too high
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 13:43:56 Do you have motors in the back?
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 13:23:14 
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 13:13:39 Yoooooooo it works
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 12:39:11 This engine and landing gear was overly complicated
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 12:20:52 yes
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 12:20:45 so far my do is 199 blocks
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 12:16:15 and hopefully some custom landing gear
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 12:16:02 Imma put the engine son
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 12:15:56 
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 12:04:16 it's titanic all over again
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 12:04:02 did you turn it to 300?
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 12:03:38 turn gravity slider to 300
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 12:01:19 
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 12:01:07 so far my do is 173 blocks
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 11:46:14 yes
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 11:44:56 Do-17 almost completed in the body part
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 11:35:36 I'm still testing it
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 11:35:28 What
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 11:32:53 pew pew
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 11:18:18 Ok back to building my do
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 11:17:31 was that a V1 missile?
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 11:15:55 I'd say set you max angle for the motor 2s for like 45
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 11:15:39 Custom ailerons are way better than normal control surfaces
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 11:14:33 Pack jets anywhere you can
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 11:11:21 "I was in my spitfire chasing down some stukas"
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 11:11:10 "I remember BOB like it was yesterday sunny boy"
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 11:10:34 Instead of being called the battle of britain it should be called BOB
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 11:09:44 Didn't say where it was fitted
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 11:08:59 It was also used in the korean war afterwards
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 11:08:49 But F6F was the first american plane to truly beat the A6M zero
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 11:08:34 I dunno
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 11:07:26 DO-17 had radar so it would probably win
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 11:07:10 DO-17 night fighter at high altitude vs P-51 at low altitude
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 11:06:04 Too bad a P-38 shot down the G4M1 bomber that was carrying him
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 11:05:04 If japan didn't underestimate america before the battle of midway they could of won
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 11:03:40 Did you know that towards the end of the pacific war with japan running low on supplies they stopped using hydraulics in tank turrets and the gunners had to use their own bodies to move the turrets
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 11:02:17 oh ok
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 11:01:59 I swear it used to be twelve
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 11:01:54 Is it me or was the maximum amount of guns reduced to ten?
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 10:58:56 so far my do-17 is 106 blocks
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 10:57:01 Did you know that it was the germans in WW2 that discovered the uses of swept wings?
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 10:56:24 Blueprints don't have signs
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 10:56:17 That is why i post blueprints
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 10:56:06 I am making that plane but without the bad german sign
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 10:55:37 i am not allowed to say the bad german sign?
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 10:55:14 yeah
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 10:54:20 Pretty sure it's reconniscance
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 10:53:09 what think of my DO-17 Night fighter?
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 10:47:38 Madattak and Rikie I take it back half wedge 2's were a great idea
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 10:41:31 there has got to be an easier way to make this
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 10:36:16 Guys look a flying pencil
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 10:24:16 I'll make a uhh four prop blade do-17
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 10:21:00 will
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 10:20:56 the plane withh go backwards
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 10:20:51 if you try make a triple bladed engine
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 10:20:42 too bad i can't make a triple bladed engine
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 10:20:32 Imma try build a DO-17
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 10:07:20 I still want fuel tank wing panels
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 10:05:48 In ww2 they kept fuel in the wings
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 10:05:20 We need wing panels with fuel tanks
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 18:39:53 e
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 18:39:51 e
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 18:16:25 It's actually prettty effective
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 18:15:58 this is good
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 18:15:53 Ok guys I made the torpedo work
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 17:22:08 It's making it a pain to build torpedo bombers
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 17:21:50 Disconnectors refuse to works unless they are like this
plane-crazy 2020-05-26 10:55:13 e
plane-crazy 2020-05-26 07:28:55 nobody knows
plane-crazy 2020-05-26 07:28:53 or the americans copied them
plane-crazy 2020-05-26 07:28:46 I think they copied the americans
plane-crazy 2020-05-26 07:17:32 F4U 1-A
plane-crazy 2020-05-26 07:17:20 A6M2 mod 11

plane-crazy 2020-05-26 07:15:32 I only speak japanese plane
plane-crazy 2020-05-26 07:15:09 wat
plane-crazy 2020-05-26 07:13:39 and if you don't like it you can use it for another thing later on
plane-crazy 2020-05-26 07:13:22 you build the important parts the structure
plane-crazy 2020-05-26 07:13:07 like a sketch for a painting
plane-crazy 2020-05-26 07:12:59 The draft
plane-crazy 2020-05-26 07:11:22 but first i need to work on a torpedo
plane-crazy 2020-05-26 07:11:03 Maybe the Seina planes too?
plane-crazy 2020-05-26 07:10:53 might build the I-400 submarine
plane-crazy 2020-05-26 07:10:21 E
plane-crazy 2020-05-26 07:10:20 I am about to say a terrible letter
plane-crazy 2020-05-26 07:07:11 i will commit terrible crimes
plane-crazy 2020-05-26 07:05:52 is it in build mode or drive
plane-crazy 2020-05-26 07:05:34 wait how is it..
plane-crazy 2020-05-26 07:04:41 Answer my question
plane-crazy 2020-05-26 07:01:05 I think the I-400 is an engineering masterpiece, do you guys agree?
plane-crazy 2020-05-16 13:59:30 very cool
plane-crazy 2020-05-16 13:59:00 Vulture droid
plane-crazy 2020-05-16 08:13:12 I doubt it will fly but it'll look cool
plane-crazy 2020-05-16 08:12:37 SAAB-340 i'm working on
