creations-chat 2018-11-17 01:48:56 i had to remove my a-10 they were getting on my nerves, build aborted
creations-chat 2018-11-17 01:56:07 they ended up calling me a 10 year old became really toxic, the reason why is they were both blacklisted users, for the reason above, so they were most likely 10
creations-chat 2018-11-17 01:57:31 oh i didnt make it, i aborted due to toxic players
creations-chat 2018-11-17 01:57:48 then i shoved em off the map, funny reactions, then more salt, so i left
creations-chat 2018-11-17 01:58:32 they were like, oh wow hes def 10 years old, but i can get a legit paying job and i have a bank card,
creations-chat 2018-11-17 01:58:43 they were confused at how i pushed em off the map tho
creations-chat 2018-11-17 01:59:26 (this is why you dont play on public servers children)
creations-chat 2018-11-17 02:00:51 sometimes you get the best reactions to edge pushes when they are acting toxic
creations-chat 2018-11-17 02:01:02 or blacklist flight mode resets
