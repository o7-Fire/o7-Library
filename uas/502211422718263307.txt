[TITLE] - hot air balloon 
[CATEGORY] - item

[DESCRIPTION] -  the hot air balloon would not be a vehicle its self, but could be attached to vehicles, with a tiny pot producing controllable flame attached to a resizable balloon, allowing you to go up or down or easily stay in the same spot. the larger the flame the more upwards speed, the larger the balloon the higher weight it can carry

bug-reports 2020-08-30 17:19:24 can someone find if its only me, or are hit boxes of blocks broken? half blocks are welding to blocks that they would be connected to if they were normal blocks. even though visually they dont connect.
bug-reports 2020-08-30 18:46:17 i remember them working though... like i remember half blocks not welding to other blocks unless they actually touched
bug-reports 2020-08-30 22:34:34 rickje absolutely roasting bug reporters compilation
bug-reports 2020-08-30 22:36:13 i believe on newer builds the 0.9 block is welding to other blocks even when the only side it can weld through is the 0.9 side.
bug-reports 2020-08-30 22:39:05 oh nvm... guess its on me or just a glitch
bug-reports 2020-08-31 00:37:16 i see no need to remove absolutely broken suspension and piston physics. breaking into the fourth dimension may eventually be used to teleport controllably or get insane amounts of speed. we just need to find out what makes it tick
bug-reports 2020-08-31 05:27:48 Y‚Äôall are so ungrateful. The devs let you break into the fourth dimension and teleport and achieve insane speed and you want it removed?

creations-chat 2020-09-01 00:29:07 When making formula cars use 2x2 cylinders attached to a motor which is attached to another motor both at the max speed with friction texture on the cylinders. You‚Äôll need to add lots of ballast blocks or wings to keep it from bouncing around.

bug-reports 2020-09-03 02:05:29 i dont think i hit that button lol. im not complaining. time to re-learn how to make a plane
creations-chat 2020-09-03 09:24:02 How to vtol: vroom vroom but up. Put vroom vroom in middle. Make sure to limit any turning of the main upwards thrust so it doesn‚Äôt launch you in some wacky direction. On your first vtols fell free to use wings attached to fast motors to control your yaw.

creations-chat 2020-09-03 22:04:17 agreed
creations-chat 2020-09-03 22:04:25 its my vote so i can dislike it
creations-chat 2020-09-03 22:04:48 giant cars are dumb
creations-chat 2020-09-03 22:05:04 imagine if the streets were filled with those things
creations-chat 2020-09-03 22:05:26 add detail and suspension in a smaller vehicle

creations-chat 2020-09-03 22:06:59 i sent a link to one yes
creations-chat 2020-09-03 22:07:59 its not 1:1 scale. its simply not for giants
creations-chat 2020-09-03 22:08:38 i gave you a dislike because i disliked your build. im not saying that its bad or that you didnt work hard enough, its simply not my taste
creations-chat 2020-09-03 22:09:11 plane crazy battle royale yes
creations-chat 2020-09-03 22:09:22 > So u saying that if there was an amazing tank but I don‚Äôt like tanks that I would dislike it
<@!674434894616854548> this is exactly what i did
creations-chat 2020-09-03 22:10:19 > Bruh that‚Äôs just dumb
<@!674434894616854548> using words like "dumb" or "stupid" to argue with people is the same as answering 1+1=x with x
creations-chat 2020-09-03 22:11:12 you're too sophisticated for me, hence your way too big car thing
creations-chat 2020-09-03 22:11:50 imma go back to playing games on itch. can people stop pinging others over dislikes?
creations-chat 2020-09-03 22:12:18 why is it that the mass disliked people dont ping over dislikes but the mostly liked people do
creations-chat 2020-09-03 22:12:28 its greedy, ignorant, and ungrateful
creations-chat 2020-09-03 22:18:48 heres my tip: why is there i absolutely giant block on the front
creations-chat 2020-09-03 22:19:05 also why are the wheels so big
creations-chat 2020-09-03 22:19:19 no
creations-chat 2020-09-03 22:20:12 i didnt get tips. the community wants mass motor locked things with wedges absolutely everywhere. i dont. i care more about functionality and efficiency than ALL THE DETAILS
creations-chat 2020-09-03 22:21:21 efficient functionality. i can fit suspension and a motor into a 4x4 area that shrinks when the suspension leaves build mode
creations-chat 2020-09-03 22:21:53 but this doesnt get likes because people want giant super detailed monster things
creations-chat 2020-09-03 22:22:31 instead of wanting a good creation in plane crazy, they want giant over-detailed unrealistically sized monsters.
creations-chat 2020-09-03 22:22:48 you cant race in a car that takes up the entire build area
creations-chat 2020-09-03 22:23:08 everything can offroad
creations-chat 2020-09-03 22:23:31 i dont care if you can offroad. we can all offroad.
creations-chat 2020-09-03 22:23:56 yes
creations-chat 2020-09-03 22:24:32 > Caaan u
<@!674434894616854548> are you going to proceed to add an a to every "can" until i leave you alone?
creations-chat 2020-09-03 22:25:23 oh i forgot. i made a fully working car in a 3x4x3 area.
creations-chat 2020-09-03 22:25:41 so dont talk to me about needing to be big for functionality
creations-chat 2020-09-03 22:25:53 it doesnt need to look good to be a good car
creations-chat 2020-09-03 22:26:09 it looks even better when you fit decoration into a small build
creations-chat 2020-09-03 22:26:20 exactly
creations-chat 2020-09-03 22:26:36 which is my problem with the <#384025409945337856> community
creations-chat 2020-09-03 22:27:11 it dislikes perfectly good creations.
creations-chat 2020-09-03 22:27:18 because of a lack of wedges
creations-chat 2020-09-03 22:27:44 a decent build
creations-chat 2020-09-03 22:28:01 i said "creations"
creations-chat 2020-09-03 22:28:21 why.
creations-chat 2020-09-03 22:28:30 is there a giant sphere in the middle of it
creations-chat 2020-09-03 22:29:00 play "dream car builder" on steam. this is a block based game
creations-chat 2020-09-03 22:29:29 arent we all?
creations-chat 2020-09-03 22:29:40 they should fix motorlock. i mean, its a glitch.
creations-chat 2020-09-03 22:29:45 yes
creations-chat 2020-09-03 22:29:56 it IS a glitch
creations-chat 2020-09-03 22:30:09 its a feature because it was exploited
creations-chat 2020-09-03 22:30:26 it is a glitch
creations-chat 2020-09-03 22:30:37 yeah me
creations-chat 2020-09-03 22:30:44 its a glitch
creations-chat 2020-09-03 22:30:50 clipping blocks is a glitch
creations-chat 2020-09-03 22:31:11 yes its useful, its a glitch that is exploited
creations-chat 2020-09-03 22:31:32 it takes away the challenge of compacting features into builds/
creations-chat 2020-09-03 22:31:47 why?
creations-chat 2020-09-03 22:31:50 they arent glitches
creations-chat 2020-09-03 22:32:28 the community is discord, the actual playerbase mostly doesnt know how to use motorlock
creations-chat 2020-09-03 22:32:59 the real players should be the community. not the exploiters here on discord
creations-chat 2020-09-03 22:33:19 > you clearly havent made any builds that are significantly more visually appealing than a tutorial shredder bug
<@!479298992874979328> i dont do pvp
creations-chat 2020-09-03 22:33:41 motorlockers are exploiting a glitch that allows you to clip blocks into each other.
creations-chat 2020-09-03 22:34:22 yes, glitches are useful, so is hacking and cheating and copying. but they are all malicious
creations-chat 2020-09-03 22:34:34 it was always a bug. people simply normalized it
creations-chat 2020-09-03 22:35:20 yes theres an issue with the normalization of a bug, so widespread the devs are scared of fixing it
creations-chat 2020-09-03 22:35:44 why would i leave? i love this game
creations-chat 2020-09-03 22:36:01 go play build a boat if you like exploiting
creations-chat 2020-09-03 22:37:02 > omggg blob is under 13
<@!614659754249420810> spamming this over an over in an attempt to get me banned is silly, since, you know, it doesnt mean anything
creations-chat 2020-09-03 22:37:27 > he meant exploiting the glitches
<@!455009731430449163> duh, was that not obvious?
creations-chat 2020-09-03 22:37:36 bugs arent features, they are bugs
creations-chat 2020-09-03 22:38:26 they are especially bugs if the playerbase that doesnt know about them suffers because they cant make their builds hyper-realistic
creations-chat 2020-09-03 22:39:51 *boby not bloby
creations-chat 2020-09-03 22:41:02 i dont like oversized builds because they are unrealistic and take away the spotlight from people that make excellent, efficient, realistically sized builds
creations-chat 2020-09-03 22:41:46 when you find someone driving a car that is 40x taller than them go tell me its realistic
creations-chat 2020-09-03 22:42:17 yes its their own creation, and its my vote, so i will downvote

creations-chat 2020-09-03 22:47:20 > u know sometimes bullying isnt that bad because it teaches ppl like u to not do something bad lol
<@!674434894616854548> i agree but sadly, politics arent allowed here so i cant express where bullying is acceptable or not
creations-chat 2020-09-03 22:48:01 i said that motorlock is an bug, which it is. clipping blocks into each other is a bug.
creations-chat 2020-09-03 22:48:42 the bug cant be a feature. it needs to be removed and re-added as a feature. you cant just call a bug a feature
creations-chat 2020-09-03 22:49:16 the bug needs to be fixed, and motorlocking needs to be added legitimately. until than its a bug in my eyes
creations-chat 2020-09-03 22:49:50 because until its removed its a bug
creations-chat 2020-09-03 22:50:36 my builds? i spend a large amount of time trying to maximize the efficiency of compact simplistic mechanisms
creations-chat 2020-09-03 22:51:26 showcasing motorlocking as a glitch doesnt break my argument
creations-chat 2020-09-03 22:52:19 most of my builds are unfinished
creations-chat 2020-09-03 22:52:46 only if you all stop spamming
creations-chat 2020-09-03 22:53:12 .
creations-chat 2020-09-03 22:53:26 its tiny and efficient? how is it trash?
creations-chat 2020-09-03 22:53:43 > IDOIT
<@!614659754249420810> no u
creations-chat 2020-09-03 22:54:06 > BRO BOBY IF YOU BUILD LIKE THAT, THE ONLY THING I'LL TREAT YOU TO IS THE HOMELESS MAN'S COKE STASH.
<@!470018120317403137> this is fine with me please proceed
creations-chat 2020-09-03 22:55:28 and than you have me who can make a one block wide plane without motorlocking
creations-chat 2020-09-03 22:56:08 i was having fun and made this. its fun to watch
creations-chat 2020-09-03 22:56:26 i know
creations-chat 2020-09-03 22:56:40 its still fun to look at
creations-chat 2020-09-03 22:57:50 > blob probably thinks this is a fine piece of art
<@!674434894616854548> i dont. its way too wide and there isnt enough detail. however the default wheels are faster than custom wheels, and spinning them extra with more motors makes it even better. in short, it'll perform better than your truck chassis
creations-chat 2020-09-03 22:58:12 i love motors
creations-chat 2020-09-03 22:58:29 yes
creations-chat 2020-09-03 22:58:54 our brains are all the same size
creations-chat 2020-09-03 22:59:32 thats unscientific
creations-chat 2020-09-03 23:00:17 > actually blobs' brain is his profile picture LOL
<@!674434894616854548> well yes but no
creations-chat 2020-09-03 23:00:25 yes
creations-chat 2020-09-03 23:01:11 it has rockets. rockets are violent and are made to hurt many people. im sorry for not liking that being inside a kids game about building planes
creations-chat 2020-09-03 23:02:08 beneficial space travel cant be achieved with rockets. too expensive and slow
creations-chat 2020-09-03 23:03:17 if we ever want to colonize mars or harvest Jupiter we need a much more efficient launch system. something that doesnt cost too much, and can lift more
creations-chat 2020-09-03 23:05:13 the build im working on is a giant rectangular prism with propellers. its very fun to drive. im thinking of somehow getting yaw into a smaller system
creations-chat 2020-09-03 23:06:38 *what if motorlocked can be used to compact cars even more...?*
creations-chat 2020-09-03 23:07:20 > you can fucking make a 2x3 car with motorlock
<@!720024036863901717> i can beat that easily without it
creations-chat 2020-09-03 23:07:58 2x3 is too small to be realistic sorry'
creations-chat 2020-09-03 23:08:02 get on scale
creations-chat 2020-09-03 23:08:47 its simply too small. its not to scale with the roblox avata
creations-chat 2020-09-03 23:09:54 > Splish Splash Your Opinion Is Trash
<@!720024036863901717> we should talk about politics
creations-chat 2020-09-03 23:10:25 > <@!502211422718263307> how about no
<@!335599526414909451> in dms silly
creations-chat 2020-09-03 23:11:28 legos usually dont clip into each other
creations-chat 2020-09-03 23:12:16 space doesnt have drag... why does it need to minimize drag.
creations-chat 2020-09-03 23:12:52 i didnt break any rules.
creations-chat 2020-09-03 23:13:04 however everyone here did break rules
creations-chat 2020-09-03 23:13:43 do you want me to get evidence of everyone breaking the rules? i can
creations-chat 2020-09-03 23:14:45 they wouldnt patch it, rick has been pressured into sending the game into a world it wasnt originally supposed to enter
creations-chat 2020-09-03 23:14:59 exactly
creations-chat 2020-09-03 23:15:54 useful exploiting is the reason rainbow six siege gamemodes had to be removed.
