creations-chat 2021-01-11 10:29:58 What kind of angle? Top down? Side? <@456226577798135808> <@!688416918872260617>
creations-chat 2021-01-11 10:32:09 Left side
They are custom flaps? They even slow the craft down as intended
creations-chat 2021-01-11 10:35:23 <@!705822048781598821> It can go 350 horizontal. Flaps on it goes to 225-ish after slowing with them on
creations-chat 2021-01-11 10:40:05 Because that's what they do irl according to one of my friends
creations-chat 2021-01-11 10:43:41 Wikipedia, and images off of my phone

<@!422347528688762880> in my experience in flying games flaps slow the craft down, so I use them for accurate strafes

Why tf is there a slowmode that's so long?
creations-chat 2021-01-11 10:46:15 Lmao makes sense, wanna just move to <#384021699466756107> then?
