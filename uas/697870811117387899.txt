Yes they move using swashplate however the up and down movement is caused by lift

False the swashplate is controlled by yoke yes but the up and down flapping is lift 
Your second statement is correct to my furthest understanding. <:stuff:908917207986208828>

Yes further proves my point, the lift is part of the design to make the blades fold up during flight


Wait all this time by flapping you ment pitch?

creations-chat 2022-07-04 05:25:21 Ahh but what you dont know is that the ah1w barely has any flapping ability and at most the "flapping" is always up during flight <:thoink:657279634563399720>

creations-chat 2022-12-18 06:34:46 Partially correct, it made space for heat absorbing tiles, also looks cool
creations-chat 2022-12-18 06:41:23 Looking cool is the opinion of millions of people you just happen to be one of the other millions who think otherwise because they are used to seeing "normal designs" and that is why humans arnt developing as fast as they should be.
creations-chat 2022-12-18 06:43:25 Normal design would be the common every day fucking nozzle, must be blind.
creations-chat 2022-12-18 06:46:08 There all circular nozzles that open and close, f22 is an exception because it uses the same general design of the yf-23's
creations-chat 2022-12-18 06:49:05 Actually they were not forced to use anything, they both came up with their designs from scratch on their own with one goal in mind. Be better than the su27


Second. That is why those nozzles are normal because they are common cone, circular nozzles.
creations-chat 2022-12-18 06:52:10 Those engines were supplied by another company and were best at the time. What els are you supposed to do?

Also would you use an engine from another country on your super secret project?

<@761354294859005962> it did outperform yf22 but sadly the company that made yf22 had a better reputation : (

<@761354294859005962> i agree

creations-chat 2022-12-22 05:45:46 Sometimes its pistons, usually put ~4 pistons per keybind for me
creations-chat 2022-12-22 05:52:55 For the motor lag,(I once tested) try and use only 1-6 blocks per angle locked motor if you have over 20 angle locks

events-chat 2023-02-24 02:07:32 I love the part where he never said "classified files"
events-chat 2023-02-24 02:09:50 Leak implies a bit of information about a particular thing is exposed to the public
events-chat 2023-02-24 02:10:30 Most news stations say "leak" or "leaked"

events-chat 2023-02-24 14:15:31 No, because a server would have seen/saved/ sent it around
events-chat 2023-02-24 14:15:47 Making it publicly known
events-chat 2023-02-24 14:15:58 Thus no longer classifies
events-chat 2023-02-24 14:16:29 Then the government would be forced to open it

creations-chat 2023-02-28 21:51:09 The top camo is really used for low flying, higher flying aircraft would have a hard time seeing

And revers. Its sky grey on the bottom so unless you're flying above clouds, it works.
