creations-chat 2022-06-05 14:24:04 Thats an 737 nose clearly
creations-chat 2022-06-05 14:26:58 Ngl now that I think about it it looks like a combination of both cause of the round nose and pointy end of the windshield
creations-chat 2022-06-05 14:29:07 No the a320 has a round end on the last one but ok guess I dont want this to become a twitter argument
creations-chat 2022-06-05 14:31:08 Ye same most of it looks like an airbus
creations-chat 2022-06-05 14:33:45 Try it with 1 block and trails on the front of the blades
creations-chat 2022-06-05 15:42:21 6 ninjago minifigures out of 11 cesna 109s
creations-chat 2022-06-05 15:48:40 Its youtube, nothing ever does anything except giving money to a person by clicking buttons
creations-chat 2022-06-05 15:50:55 Question can you use hover engines in a plane for throtle? (I mean in ranks)

creations-chat 2022-06-05 15:56:11 Ye I have a giant detailed thing but I couldnt make the ups livery right so its    blocky and no gear doors sadly
creations-chat 2022-06-05 19:45:40 ok the nose cone I cant really do dif since it is suppose to open
creations-chat 2022-06-05 19:49:23 like ingame it looks much better, the only thing I hate is I didnt have space for the gear doors
creations-chat 2022-06-05 19:51:51 Im gonna post a dc 3 soon so Im gonna see ur reaction on it, it aint that special but eh
creations-chat 2022-06-05 19:54:53 its in creations

bot-central 2022-06-06 16:44:08 Click on the squares
bot-central 2022-06-06 16:44:43 Just dont click on a mine
bot-central 2022-06-06 16:45:06 Kinda
bot-central 2022-06-06 16:45:14 U have squares with numeres
bot-central 2022-06-06 16:45:41 That can see all teh numbers around it so it make a 3x3 grid
bot-central 2022-06-06 16:45:57 So it can see 8 numbers
bot-central 2022-06-06 16:46:03 And if its a 1
bot-central 2022-06-06 16:46:12 There is a mine in one of the squares
bot-central 2022-06-06 16:46:16 If its a 2
bot-central 2022-06-06 16:46:30 Then there are 2 mines somewhere around it
bot-central 2022-06-06 16:47:12 What do you think lol

creations-chat 2022-06-08 07:40:12 ye I tried couldnt do much since I have a litear gearbox of motorlocking which is just pain to go thru
creations-chat 2022-06-08 07:53:18 I mean nose I can fix but the exposed ml I cant I tried everything but its just in a weird spot for it to be fixed I will post a pic of the ml soon
creations-chat 2022-06-08 07:56:46 this is a part of the ml
creations-chat 2022-06-08 12:31:51 As I said I genuenly cant do shit about it, maybe the things on the tail but else no shot
creations-chat 2022-06-08 12:33:53 Idk I checked the blueprint from a top down it looks like its good
creations-chat 2022-06-08 12:38:19 Hmm I dont think I used that bp, and also that looks like the thrust vecotring model
creations-chat 2022-06-08 12:41:21 The blueprint u used is really weird the tail air brake is slanted in for some reason while the middle part of it should be at the same length as the nozzle and the engines look like the thrust vectoring model while I was building a version B I think
creations-chat 2022-06-08 12:48:10 The nose is angled but you can see it normally
creations-chat 2022-06-09 10:21:14 huh wow the mig 29 almost got into hof, 15 upvotes to it to be exact
creations-chat 2022-06-09 10:35:34 no I posted a mig 29 https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/384025409945337856/983997110011711538
creations-chat 2022-06-09 10:37:45 I explained the exposed ml and ok bruh it doesnt have to have every spec perfect
creations-chat 2022-06-09 10:42:00 not really since alot of the jets have them, better feature is the cockpit I made since lets be real the mig 29 and f 14 both have angled intakes and also nearly the same airbrake
creations-chat 2022-06-09 10:46:09 thanks tho I really want to get it in the hof since its 15 upvotes from the limit and I feel like it could get in
creations-chat 2022-06-09 10:50:01 Oh and btw I have a B52 in the works which has the actuall interior from irl even the catwalk tho I couldnt make the catwalk as exactly as it is since Im using a really old chassis that has been remodeled twice already
creations-chat 2022-06-09 17:39:07 I can confirm it aint a copy I know the guy and he has been making it for like 3/4 days already
creations-chat 2022-06-09 17:41:16 its top gun season bro
creations-chat 2022-07-03 22:39:41 yea for now I cant really since I barely got time to take pics of this thing and I have alot of stuff on hold currently if I remember i will add more
creations-chat 2022-07-03 22:42:49 kinda just wanted to put it out since it was on works for a bit of time already and now we just see how it performs
