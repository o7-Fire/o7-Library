creations-chat 2022-04-17 17:21:07 What's WIP?
creations-chat 2022-04-17 17:23:14 I deleted the unfinished creation from <#384025409945337856> .
creations-chat 2022-04-17 17:25:02 Dude, I didn't know.
creations-chat 2022-04-17 17:26:48 I read them.
creations-chat 2022-04-17 17:28:29 I basically only missed out only that part when I was reading it.
creations-chat 2022-04-17 17:31:04 By the way, what do you guys think of the motor-lock system on this?
creations-chat 2022-04-17 17:33:17 Here's what it looks like locked.

creations-chat 2022-07-20 17:47:46 the floating motors are for folding, if it weren't for them, the build would collapse.
creations-chat 2022-07-20 17:49:54 honestly, I probably won't change anything, I wanted it to basically look like this.
creations-chat 2022-07-20 17:51:58 I didn't make it specifically for destroying shredders, I made it for kind of like acting, if you know what I mean.
I am making tons of these vehicles for acting.
creations-chat 2022-07-20 17:54:01 For example, I am working on the Anti-Shredder Panther and anti-shredder Stegodyphus.
creations-chat 2022-07-20 17:56:50 yeah, well, after the release of the rest of my ships, I may or may not rebuild it in a different form.
help 2022-09-04 18:47:57 I keep trying to fix this error in this piece of motorlock but it continues to go into this block when I want it to face the corner and go into this corner (the dark grey along with the light grey)
help 2022-09-04 18:48:27 Does anybody know why this might be happening?
help 2022-09-04 18:50:17 this is the motor lock mechanism
help 2022-09-04 18:53:44 can someone tell me what is the problem with this
help 2022-09-04 18:55:35 instead of the curved piece going into the dark and light grey corner, it goes into the white block
help 2022-09-04 18:56:22 it is as if the curved piece just doesn't want to go inside the corner
help 2022-09-04 18:57:17 wdym?
help 2022-09-04 18:58:01 so you want me to rebuild the motorlock a bit to the side? alr
help 2022-09-04 19:01:29 it won't work since the curve will stick to the grey part
help 2022-09-04 19:01:51 and I will not be able to use motorlock
help 2022-09-04 19:04:32 I can try somehow just using plain curves without turning them at all but it would looks wrong with all the pieces sticking out
help 2022-09-04 19:05:07 but that would be wrong, and I refuse to do that
help 2022-09-04 19:05:24 motorlock
help 2022-09-04 19:06:40 make a hole in there,  form a motorlock piece with text at the end of it
help 2022-09-04 19:07:21 then idk
help 2022-09-05 10:54:06 can a motor lock expert please explain what is wrong here?
help 2022-09-05 10:58:51 I put all the motors on max torque but nothing changed
help 2022-09-05 11:02:23 so what should I do?
help 2022-09-05 11:03:16 Now?
help 2022-09-05 11:04:31 I  am trying to remake the loxodon but a bit different.
help 2022-09-05 11:05:01 wait, I'll give you a closer look at the mechanism,
help 2022-09-05 11:05:18 also would anchor blocks cause a problem?
help 2022-09-05 11:05:40 yes
help 2022-09-05 11:05:43 ok
help 2022-09-05 11:05:57 ok
help 2022-09-05 11:07:01 
help 2022-09-05 11:08:39 So what is happening is, instead of the like curved dark grey part going into the light and dark grey corner, it goes into the white block
help 2022-09-05 11:08:50 and it needs to go inside of the corner
help 2022-09-05 11:09:09 it's as if it is being pushed out
help 2022-09-05 11:10:11 it needs to go into there
help 2022-09-05 11:10:26 and I need to angle lock it
help 2022-09-05 11:10:45 ok
help 2022-09-05 11:10:55 what will that do?
help 2022-09-05 11:11:21 ah, ok
help 2022-09-05 11:11:57 It worked, thank you
creations-chat 2022-09-07 16:54:27 thanks
creations-chat 2022-09-07 17:04:52 why am I only getting downvotes
creations-chat 2022-09-08 14:41:00 It isn't supposed to look exactly like loxodon
help 2022-09-10 19:57:02 how do I be a god in motorlock and designing
creations-chat 2022-09-10 20:12:41 ok

help 2022-10-02 16:41:39 I am recreating this model of the spirit of fire from halo, yet I have no idea what I need to do to stop the motorlock for sticking out,
help 2022-10-02 16:43:32 by the way, I'm talking about this part, should I just leave it as wedges?
help 2022-10-02 16:44:28 the part in the model that is circled in blue

help 2023-05-18 16:40:33 why isn't it locking, the wedges that are supposed to lock just stay, and the motors just lock to the big part
help 2023-05-18 16:40:48 and disconnect from the wedge/half block part
help 2023-05-18 16:46:35 only the motor part is connected to the rest of the build, so it locks
help 2023-05-18 16:49:12 glass part, this part is supposed to be motorlocked over the glass
help 2023-05-18 16:49:43 the area circled in red isn't stuck to anything other than the motors
help 2023-05-18 16:50:17 ok
creations-chat 2023-06-25 19:49:31 what should I add here and any suggestion on how to make the front kind bit - the ridges more smooth, so it doesn't look so blocky
it's a spaceship
creations-chat 2023-06-25 20:11:56 it's not a star destroyer
creations-chat 2023-06-25 20:18:06 but what should I add to the next like segment of the build, this thing is gonna be  really long, im thinking about adding a cannon area with turrets sticking out of the ship on both sides but don't know how to start building it, and make it look smooth, the top part is gonna look really weird if I just leave it flat on the back
creations-chat 2023-06-25 20:31:56 I think I can use a lot parts, rotate them with motors and motor lock them together to make the round thing but it'll take a lot of time
