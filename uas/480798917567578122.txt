creations-chat 2021-12-23 17:23:54 why do yall hate my phantom?
creations-chat 2021-12-23 17:26:29 bruh what am i supposed to do then? what do i change? i did it as close to the real thing as i possibly could..
creations-chat 2021-12-23 17:28:49 I dont know what i did wrong, mate. it looks pretty neat to me, so i really dont know. If you can tell me exactly what you would change to make it look better, please tell me
creations-chat 2021-12-23 17:31:27 I didn't add the flaps nor wing tilting up as i really don't want it to look  even worse than it already is  with exposed motors on the wings
creations-chat 2021-12-23 17:34:13 Here, with my older P-51, you can see that theres alot of holes and motors ruining the look of the wings. By learning from that, i instead of adding flaps and servo control surfaces on the wings i just put 2 propellers there and, personally, it makes it look alot better.
