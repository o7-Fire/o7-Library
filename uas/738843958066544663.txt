bug-reports 2020-12-29 03:41:12 invisible sign block (no i did not set it to glass, no this isnt a text block)  i just deleted my sign to replace it with trails and it just stayed like this. hitbox is still there when building but cannot delete. does not have collision. it does save wich i find very strange. just a minor bug.
