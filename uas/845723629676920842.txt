help 2023-03-18 16:51:30 Motor 2‚Äôs
help 2023-03-18 16:51:37 They track your mouse
help 2023-03-18 16:52:36 They have the rest of the motors unpowered I‚Äôm guessing just getting dragged around
help 2023-03-18 16:52:40 Not sure though
creations-chat 2023-03-18 16:56:22 Hello all
creations-chat 2023-03-18 16:59:46 I helped some person with their build last night, they had exposed lock in the side and were asking around, so I gave them a hand and their build is looking good now.
creations-chat 2023-03-18 17:01:52 Hahah, I remember those days, the first jet I built was an F-15e and I wish I still had the build.
creations-chat 2023-03-18 17:05:56 Should I post my one wide heli with a very thin tail structure (made of angled trails)?
creations-chat 2023-03-18 17:13:57 My 1 wide heli
creations-chat 2023-03-18 17:19:19 Thank you so much! The way I make my heli‚Äôs is I add ballast to the bottom and helium at the top (thus the big round thingy on the rotor head)
creations-chat 2023-03-18 17:21:27 It flies very well. No roll or anwanted spin, and a tip: if you set the hover engines to max drag it adds a. Lot of stability, very useful.
creations-chat 2023-03-18 17:23:30 No no, you can copy it all you want, I‚Äôm here to help the community not to keep secrets.
creations-chat 2023-03-18 17:26:32 C ya later!

help 2023-03-22 05:29:49 Anchor?
help 2023-03-22 05:30:31 and if it has motorlock, check that all motors that you want to be locked are locked.
help 2023-03-22 05:31:55 And if it has camera‚Äôs (for an unnoticeable piece) make sure any camera‚Äôs aren‚Äôt pointed to another block, it will cause unwanted camera lock/angle.
help 2023-03-22 05:32:15 If that helps : )
help 2023-03-22 05:41:01 Hmm
help 2023-03-22 05:41:23 Did you try anchoring it with physics?
help 2023-03-22 05:41:41 Try that
help 2023-03-22 05:41:58 Also, does your build fling you before it locks?
help 2023-03-22 05:42:41 Weird
help 2023-03-22 05:44:32 Do you fling up or in a random direction
help 2023-03-22 05:45:22 Yes as in a random direction?
help 2023-03-22 05:45:29 Oh wow
help 2023-03-22 05:45:32 Ok then
help 2023-03-22 05:45:35 Well
help 2023-03-22 05:46:04 Do you have any pieces that need angled but aren‚Äôt locked in place?
help 2023-03-22 05:46:28 Or any pistons, any atal
help 2023-03-22 06:08:46 Alr
help 2023-03-22 06:08:47 Uhm
help 2023-03-22 06:09:08 Idk man
help 2023-03-22 06:09:18 Maybe just a bug
help 2023-03-22 06:09:41 Do you use hover engines?
help 2023-03-22 06:09:53 Or something else

contest-chat 2023-03-22 17:14:40 Hi
creations-chat 2023-03-23 01:53:00 Nice turrets.    Would give an upvote if I could
creations-chat 2023-03-23 01:55:28 Have you tried a bigger ship before? With locking the deck into the hull to make more room, very useful
creations-chat 2023-03-23 01:59:54 I‚Äôm working on a 1:1 scale IJN Kongo battleship
creations-chat 2023-03-23 02:02:11 This is the progress so far, got all the folds for the hull.      222 blocks long and 31 wide
creations-chat 2023-03-23 02:04:24 It will be the older config, 1920‚Äôs. I think it looks a lot better, and I dont know how people don‚Äôt like the ‚Äúpagoda mast‚Äù
creations-chat 2023-03-23 02:08:57 Yes that is the one. The rear mast is simple but the main mast will be a little challenging, especially 1:1
creations-chat 2023-03-23 02:11:54 Thanks for your patience. It will be quite a while (maybe 2 months or more‚Ä¶) since I am working on a 3:1 scale EMD SD70ace diesel train that goes on the rails.
creations-chat 2023-03-23 02:15:18 I will definitely have to see that when it‚Äôs finished. Sounds like a fun project. And thanks for the good luck : )

the-dump 2023-03-24 22:33:34 .
help 2023-03-24 22:44:40 Well actually, if you add a lot of weight to the center of your jet then add the same amount in the center with helium you will be able to do a general cobra, just make sure your nose has some sort of drag in it like a wing panel for example
creations-chat 2023-03-27 03:01:32 Shader names? Please
creations-chat 2023-03-27 03:03:40 Lmao, I got roshaders but I don‚Äôt know the best ones to put on, any input would be appreciated :).
