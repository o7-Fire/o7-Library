creations-chat 2021-06-27 18:33:18 we live in a society
creations-chat 2021-06-27 18:38:10 thank
creations-chat 2021-06-27 18:42:27 yes
creations-chat 2021-07-03 12:53:21 when the mecc sus?
creations-chat 2021-08-07 15:16:49 god halpas all
creations-chat 2021-08-24 08:07:42 what do you guys think of a carrier battleship hybrid? I just make a smaller model of it before i carry on
On second thought maybe having the guns facing the runway is a bad idea
<@!441939688018935818> ive never built battleships before so im  not sure how to make them properly
creations-chat 2021-08-24 08:10:27 top view
<@723940197456281640> i have 0 clue how to make battleships am sorry <:nooo:787097964946259978>
creations-chat 2021-08-24 08:14:11 i think the turret is a couple of blocks bigger than the actual one but this is modified so yeah looks gr8
(like proportionate)

But if you put proportion aside it looks very nice
maybe you can fit a motorlock in for the extra walking space?
creations-chat 2021-08-24 08:18:15 I understan goodluck then üëç
creations-chat 2021-08-25 05:04:33 nuts
events-chat 2022-02-11 08:27:45 can i move the engines elsewhere?
events-chat 2022-02-11 08:28:02 like on the tincan can i move it to another spot and not just the front?
events-chat 2022-02-11 08:29:59 aw man
events-chat 2022-02-11 08:31:19 they said u could modify, but not add extra engines so i think is ok
events-chat 2022-02-11 08:32:46 also am i restricted to the amt of wings used in the original build?? im so confuse
events-chat 2022-02-11 08:40:43 so it should be okay then
events-chat 2022-02-11 09:01:18 The engine configuration/type of your plane must stay the same. oh nvm -.-
events-chat 2022-02-11 09:22:15 whaaat
events-chat 2022-02-11 09:22:38 ok ill go delete it then
events-chat 2022-02-11 09:23:14 (to the base aircraft.) oh woops
creations-chat 2022-04-16 17:54:23 how to take better quality picture, hard to see things on build
creations-chat 2022-04-16 18:18:02 helicopter? image cannot show spinny :( or penguin ? :D
creations-chat 2022-04-16 18:20:39 i love the design and interior good job
creations-chat 2022-04-16 18:23:17 <@562286788769742869> does your back flap thingies have space to turn? when i build slanted vertical stabiliser i dont have enuf space for the horizontal stabilisers to turn also i like your build is nice and smol
creations-chat 2022-04-16 18:27:27 thanmk u ,idk what ranks are is ok
creations-chat 2022-04-16 18:47:33 wow nice!!!!!!
creations-chat 2022-04-16 18:52:04 i love your plane style!! like old roblox planes, maybe you can use more rounded wedges for the curves?
creations-chat 2022-04-16 18:54:23 make it a aircraft carrier, sorry i mean awacs
creations-chat 2022-04-16 18:56:31 yayayayayay!!!! team turn everything into aircraft carrier!!
creations-chat 2022-04-16 19:00:09 <@695336889997066251> if the nose is stubborn maybe you can try to angle lock? im bad at passenger plane but am throwing ideas out there
creations-chat 2022-04-16 19:04:55 Can send picture? Am learning to make passenger plane so i can slap a aircraft carrier deck on it <@!695336889997066251>
creations-chat 2022-04-17 08:52:25 Yayy!! My first build to reach a hundred upvotes!! What does that mean??
creations-chat 2022-04-17 08:56:31 Oh ya! I also love obsolete! I wanted to give the mech arms but it looked very weird.. since penguins dont really have arms

creations-chat 2022-04-20 22:14:58 Jaa
creations-chat 2022-05-01 17:41:47 s2k, no way thats a miata
creations-chat 2022-05-01 18:40:13 add more!! motorlockk
creations-chat 2022-05-01 18:44:46 zamn bro thats abit mean
creations-chat 2022-05-01 18:47:08 but he is right theres technically no limit except block limit
creations-chat 2022-05-01 18:52:01 you are new to the game or is that your build style
creations-chat 2022-05-01 18:55:23 the colours are very saturated , the plane looks rlly bad w it, not alot of detail
but u are new so this is expected
creations-chat 2022-05-01 19:01:25 the little half cylinders you used at the back, you can use wing panels like in uhh, f22 raptor, the thrust vector flaps it has at the end of its engine, that would be nice. Also using a colour gradient would make it less painful to look at
but overall for me just fix the colours n im happy
creations-chat 2022-05-01 19:03:36 i think its based off those new american fighters so the shape looks weird
(i'm not a fan of them and neither a fan of his design)
creations-chat 2022-05-01 19:10:58 yeah he kinda has a point, wheres the bomb bay
creations-chat 2022-05-01 19:19:33 then its bad design n execution, if it cant do its job then dont name it a stealth bomber. Makes more sense as a space, idk fighter or something

If the bombs are placed outside due to it being space faring wont they burn up?? It can only do one feature at a time

plus, bombs outside make it not stealthy. So it defeats the purpose
creations-chat 2022-05-01 19:21:47 as a design student this hurts me
creations-chat 2022-05-01 19:31:28 welcome to my catch and cook where I catch this big ass fish and cook it
creations-chat 2022-05-01 20:09:51 did the voting system stop working in creations? I dont see any reactions
creations-chat 2022-05-01 20:12:10 the reaction bot stopped working
creations-chat 2022-05-01 21:40:13 what a good boy
creations-chat 2022-05-02 12:04:30 i think it looks good, its a building idk how you can detail it like mad. Good job. (it looks pretty spot on cus the walls are pretty barren if i can remember)
creations-chat 2022-05-02 12:15:34 use textures!
creations-chat 2022-05-02 12:26:28 mech
creations-chat 2022-05-02 13:39:43 <@945822507787751448> better picture angle i cant see please
creations-chat 2022-05-02 13:42:46 the colours burn my eyes

creations-chat 2022-05-03 08:10:28 What shouldnt it be if you cant stand the heat step outta the fire. Also I subconsciously read it in Pheonix‚Äôs voice from valourant
creations-chat 2022-05-03 08:12:35 Im going to cook you
creations-chat 2022-05-03 08:58:27 He couldn‚Äôt handle criticism but (sorry i need to rewrite this) he took it too personal
creations-chat 2022-05-03 09:01:43 I mean if you post something on the creations tab you hbe to expect criticism n downvotes so if he quit from that then fat L for not being able to do his own thing

Ye it happens but in the end its still your build
creations-chat 2022-05-03 09:04:09 Like my builds are straight ass but like I still post them cus Im happy w them and I wanna show others 

So like its really best for him to leave if he cant handle criticism
creations-chat 2022-05-03 09:17:54 Idk how to respons but i agree
creations-chat 2022-05-03 09:20:14 I think thats normal from many vidya game communities just many of pcc top players act like that which is unfortunate

Ye what sebvt said is right in the end u posting in creations so you have to take the L if nobody likes it
creations-chat 2022-05-03 09:23:45 Thats in creations-chat, the <#384025409945337856> tab only has up n down votes. So like idk man
Ask for opinions first before posting i guess
Banana
creations-chat 2022-05-03 09:25:43 Well said

Both of u right end of topic ok farewell
creations-chat 2022-05-03 09:28:04 Idk man just seems like a fat L he couldnt just like do his own thing younno

What sebvt said above me. Its his own build stop being peer pressured
creations-chat 2022-05-03 09:31:18 L mentality go sigma lone wolf

creations-chat 2022-05-03 10:18:27 oh ya you can also motorlock your ijn red circle for a complete proper circle instead of a blocky one
creations-chat 2022-05-03 10:33:14 oh jaa then that makes sense
creations-chat 2022-05-03 13:26:29 its random standards
creations-chat 2022-05-03 13:28:14 its hella random my penguin mech got more likes (than my most recent build) , and it was a one off thing , it cant even move cus i just suck so bad
creations-chat 2022-05-03 13:30:11 ahhh ohh so random means upvotes
creations-chat 2022-05-03 15:37:32 I LOVE THE DETAILS MM MMMM
creations-chat 2022-05-08 16:41:17 what
creations-chat 2022-05-08 16:43:17 if you are going to repost your mech, delete the old post beforehand

creations-chat 2022-05-08 16:45:00 valid argument, however, your mother.
