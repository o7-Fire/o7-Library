creations-chat 2021-06-07 20:49:52 it's an old one, i'm new to the server, joined a few days ago
creations-chat 2021-06-07 21:01:21 delete or keep? it's a BMW M3 Custom
I don't like it
creations-chat 2021-06-16 14:58:35 did you not read it, it said "my FIRST car with suspension", i wasn't experienced
creations-chat 2021-06-16 15:45:06 it's just an idea i had, i just placed blocks and got that and stuck on a name on it, it just looks micro

and <@!504577008383033344> , i don't remember that, u win
creations-chat 2021-06-18 18:59:26 i don't want upvotes, ik it's undetailed and unrealistic, idc how many upvotes or ddownvotes it gets, just showing how bad a builder i am
creations-chat 2021-06-18 19:02:12 i am a good builder, i once got 50 upvotes on one build
creations-chat 2021-06-18 19:05:47 look for it urself
creations-chat 2021-06-18 19:10:09 i'm not an attention seeker
creations-chat 2021-06-18 19:12:26 you make one then, see how you get on why don't you
check <#384025409945337856> <@!386958950123175947>
creations-chat 2021-06-19 10:07:37 <@456226577798135808> I love the attention to detail with the little house and sail boat, the best mini world I've ever seen, that's dedication
creations-chat 2021-06-24 20:32:34 <@!780501021541269505> was that a chinook you posted in <#384025409945337856> like 3 hours ago? how did you do the landing gear, i'm trying to make one
creations-chat 2021-06-24 20:34:48 do the back wheels turn? 
it looks realistic with the slanted tyres and the fence bits, gg
creations-chat 2021-06-24 20:39:23 does this look like a chinook, 4th day of working on it, now on the interior
just need the wheels
i couldn't get the propellors to fit on the plot, they were going to be 10 long but they turned out to be 7 long
creations-chat 2021-06-24 20:42:53 how do i make them longer if i have no space, i'm running out of keys on my keyboard for motors
creations-chat 2021-06-24 20:45:18 this is my second ever heli-
my first one was a micro heli, i'm not good at big flying things, it's bigger than my scania
creations-chat 2021-06-24 20:47:26 this took hours, i'm not deleting it because the toxic discord community don't like it, i can make another one if you hate it that much
creations-chat 2021-06-24 20:49:55 it looks like an axolotl with the fins at the side
creations-chat 2021-06-24 22:41:28 I meant that I liked it and I am going to continue with it and if the people here want a different one, I'll make it on another slot
creations-chat 2021-06-26 14:06:28 why does no one like my mech, i've never made one before
creations-chat 2021-06-26 14:08:31 u need to start somewhere, i'm a truck builder
 i got skill, that's why i went for a mech with wheels instead of legs
creations-chat 2021-06-26 14:11:13 then how did i make this, i just said that i'm a truck builder,i don't make mechs
because my friend makes them and i think they're cool
i didn't, i just thought i should show people so they can tell me what to improve on
creations-chat 2021-06-26 14:44:59 i didn't know that, my friend doesn't have discord
creations-chat 2021-07-10 09:43:08 <@456226577798135808>  looks like a limo, angle the spoiler a bit with motors and make it shorter
creations-chat 2021-07-10 20:58:42 <@206891768233328640> does ur plane thingy fly
creations-chat 2021-07-13 12:19:39 <@379257519593357313> can it fly
creations-chat 2021-07-15 12:00:13 what's a hof
creations-chat 2021-07-15 12:03:34 i'm making one rn
creations-chat 2021-07-15 12:05:41 that's why i said "working on one"
creations-chat 2021-07-15 12:17:43 no
creations-chat 2021-07-16 22:04:21 why do i have 6 downvotes, most i've ever had
creations-chat 2021-07-16 22:06:57 there is no glass anywhere..
creations-chat 2021-07-16 22:09:02 i wanted it to look different from my other scania, which is 2 blocks higher with the windshield
creations-chat 2021-07-16 22:12:03 mhm, it's pretty close
this was the highliner
creations-chat 2021-07-17 00:38:31 I meant highline, got it wrong
creations-chat 2021-07-18 10:00:08 <@763427424327172097> does it float
creations-chat 2021-07-18 22:39:36 <@694291677279682650> tbh, I Don't care about your jet, but that tanker tho, it just hits the mark, I upvoted the tanker truck
creations-chat 2021-07-19 20:08:12 trucks normally have beds in them if they are travelling overnight, this community is toxic
creations-chat 2021-07-23 12:52:07 why is my RV getting so much hate, i thought the outside was good
creations-chat 2021-07-23 12:57:01 oh, so you see hippie campervans all the time?
creations-chat 2021-07-23 13:02:27 ah, i forgot to add a grill. i knew i was forgetting something
look before you speak
creations-chat 2021-07-23 13:04:33 it has plates in the kitchen
creations-chat 2021-07-23 13:06:46 why does my car boat have 9 downvotes
it was a good idea
and motors
creations-chat 2021-07-23 13:08:52 yes but jetpacks cost money, this is free
creations-chat 2021-07-23 13:11:01 true, but i make lorries and boats, not tanks. and i won't use it anyway
creations-chat 2021-07-23 13:14:07 then what's the point of flying vehicles if jetpacks exist
creations-chat 2021-07-23 13:16:20 and this is why i hate this toxic community
creations-chat 2021-07-23 13:19:42 i'm a good builder, i once got 53 upvotes on a boat
creations-chat 2021-07-23 13:34:20 i asked for feedback, not for you to swear at me
creations-chat 2021-07-23 13:49:09 i just used motor 2 and made the steering reversed like d goes left and a goes right because that's how it turns in the water, it needs to be reversed
creations-chat 2021-07-26 10:13:27 <@!447139512707973120> amazing movie, oscar nominated performance, btw only 3 of the funnels actually worked on the real one, the back one didn't
creations-chat 2021-07-26 11:10:49 very epic
creations-chat 2021-08-12 13:30:54 i accept your challenge
creations-chat 2021-08-12 15:18:46 <@456226577798135808> i did it
creations-chat 2021-08-12 15:21:32 just seats, there's not much space to add anything since the windows are half blocks and it's only 3 blocks wide
creations-chat 2021-08-12 15:36:52 you can't chat in creations
creations-chat 2021-08-12 15:38:58 it is folded
creations-chat 2021-08-15 08:48:25 It's literally just wedges at the front and sides
creations-chat 2023-06-20 18:22:22 what red is better? 1 or 2?
creations-chat 2023-06-20 18:33:44 then it looks like a pencil
creations-chat 2023-06-20 18:36:32 there's wedges here
creations-chat 2023-06-20 18:38:52 what about it?
creations-chat 2023-06-20 20:14:58 does it look weird without a boat in the middle?
