creations-chat 2020-12-18 02:31:52 Is the whole creations tab just people posting creations and then some idiot saying OoOo you didn't use enough wedges. bad build you get a downvote, trash.
creations-chat 2020-12-18 02:37:49 nah your standards are just too high. I think if it flies its good. if it flies well you are doing better than most. also that thing above is sick as fuck.
