help 2021-02-15 12:43:35 Yow I'm new. Im trying to find a simple tutorial that just straight up demonstrates the mechanisms of making mech joints move and how they work instead of just a messy block by block step which I have a hard time to understand
help 2021-02-15 12:49:08 Yeah most of the videos I found we're confusing
help 2021-02-15 12:53:36 Hmmmm ok
