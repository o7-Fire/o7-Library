bug-reports 2021-04-28 00:36:14 Yo what happened to the half pistons, The arm of the piston just falls off the block and donâ€™t work no more
bug-reports 2021-04-28 00:44:13 Update: if the piston is extended is reverts back to normal
bug-reports 2021-06-22 17:05:51 Idk about you but magnets that are togglable and can wield should be able to turn on and off, like motors, but instead just turn on and off the wield ability whilst also continuously powered.
bug-reports 2021-06-22 17:07:26 Wing panel eh?
bug-reports 2021-06-22 17:08:40 Iâ€™m building a float plane that has removeable pontoons, the magnets are connected to the wing panels. Is that the problem?
bug-reports 2021-06-26 17:48:20 Do magnets just not work anymore?
bug-reports 2021-06-26 18:08:55 Magnets are not togglable or weldable
bug-reports 2021-06-26 18:10:28 I donâ€™t understand
bug-reports 2021-06-26 18:12:17 I rejoined the server and when I check the magnet stats, the toggle option turned off
bug-reports 2021-06-26 18:12:25 Why
bug-reports 2021-06-26 18:13:07 I did, still dose the toggle
bug-reports 2021-06-26 18:13:19 Does motor locks have to do anything with magnets
bug-reports 2021-06-26 18:13:37 Iâ€™m moving the magnet into a position that it can be welded together
bug-reports 2021-06-26 18:14:49 Ok I fixed it, I welded the magnets while it was anchored in place
bug-reports 2021-06-26 18:15:03 :â€™(
bug-reports 2021-06-30 20:17:10 If you load in a build using sparklers, if you play the build the sparks letâ€™s wonâ€™t stick to ANYTHING in any orientation in the place the loaded sparklers were, if you place them anywhere else they stick.
bug-reports 2021-07-09 21:00:07 Control surfaces, without any movement, can make my build jump around
bug-reports 2021-09-04 20:51:45 idk why, but some reason, in some pattern or ammount, signs stop working. I had a build that usesd excessive ammount of signs, and special characters wouldnt work. deleted it and characters started working.. pls why
bug-reports 2021-09-04 21:04:16 yes
bug-reports 2021-09-04 21:04:28 3 tags together "###"
bug-reports 2021-09-04 21:04:54 if the special character is mixed with a letter though, its visible
bug-reports 2021-09-04 21:07:18 thats impossible
bug-reports 2021-09-04 21:07:31 if i load any other save file the special characters work
bug-reports 2021-09-04 21:07:50 its just on a blank canvis or the one im working on
