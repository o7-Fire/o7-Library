help 2021-08-28 02:32:19 Weight and Lift are balanced
help 2021-08-28 02:32:32 but when I fly, it frontflips

help 2021-10-10 01:43:38 negative ballast
creations-chat 2021-10-14 02:19:12 feedback since apparently everyone hates it?
creations-chat 2021-10-14 02:59:07 okay, Im working on a new one rn
but the huge fenders was a side effect of the wheels needing a stupid amount of clearance to not lockup
creations-chat 2021-10-14 03:12:11 3x3 wheels are too big and 2x2 wheels are too small
creations-chat 2021-10-14 03:42:52 Okay, here's the new one
creations-chat 2021-10-14 05:00:50 as a rail enthusiast, I'd recommend using bogies. Most rail cars use multiple sets of wheels attached to the frame to get around tighter curves.
creations-chat 2021-10-14 05:18:49 my mistake
I just got the names mixed up, my model IS a W900
Although it isnt a 1974
creations-chat 2021-10-14 05:22:13 for the single stripe, blame plane crazy, I DO have another model with more accurate stripes and for the colors, I just suck at making custom ones. this is still a WIP though. it's just finished for now

help 2021-12-29 23:18:04 Hi, Im trying to make a VTOL and, despite the center of mass being equal distances from both sets of lift engines, the vehicle still tilts backwards when lifting, could someone help?
help 2021-12-29 23:20:43 its going vertical, slowly
help 2021-12-29 23:20:52 and this is happening the moment it begins to rise
help 2021-12-29 23:36:12 done, it works now, but requires A LOT of input to prevent it from losing control
help 2021-12-29 23:36:22 but, with the right training, it can be ran
creations-chat 2022-01-24 18:34:23 can I have some feedback on this Bell 74 Sioux
creations-chat 2022-01-24 18:36:38 pretty cool
texturing? its glass
creations-chat 2022-01-24 18:38:43 <:hahaa:773727260539617280>üëç I agree with the person below me, out on the road, these things get pretty dirty
creations-chat 2022-01-24 18:47:06 I'd add some basic detail to the wheel sets along with increasing their size
creations-chat 2022-01-24 18:49:12 you
increase wheel diameter and add some detailing to the outside
