creations-chat 2021-04-27 10:51:52 feedback on this UH-1Y? or should I get a closer pic
creations-chat 2021-04-27 10:58:17 understandable, thank you for feedback, I'll get a closer pick in a second
creations-chat 2021-04-27 11:01:27 Sorry, I'll try to post some other pictures, but slow mode has me crippled. I'll also post it unspawned if requested :D
creations-chat 2021-04-27 11:07:19 Here is the front, the cockpit doors are open btw
creations-chat 2021-04-27 11:09:34 Thank you very much!
creations-chat 2021-04-28 00:18:09 I'd recommend using a motor to set the tail boom at a custom angle
creations-chat 2021-04-28 00:22:31 The tail looks like this btw, so a locked motor to set it at an angle would help make it thinner as well
creations-chat 2021-04-28 00:29:09 Looks like hell
creations-chat 2021-04-28 00:32:03 Yeah, you really gotta improve that canopy, make it taller and have a rounder front that isn't such a low angle
creations-chat 2021-04-28 01:13:11 First of all, the canopy looks much better compared to the last version, so good work. Personally though, for highlighted area, I'd just replace that half wedge down with a corner wedge down, and then place a half triangle wedge on top of it, like this
creations-chat 2021-04-28 01:16:16 Looks good, but I'd maybe shorten the canopy a bit, but aside from that it honestly looks good already. Oh, but don't forget to add a delta wing panel onto the sides, you can see AH-1Zs that they kinda have an angle on the side of the canopy
creations-chat 2021-04-28 01:18:47 You're welcome friend
creations-chat 2021-04-28 01:36:57 Oh, and <@!709209810310004837>, you can also try and make the gun directly in front of the motor if you want. Just attach some trails and stuff to make the guns not directly come into contact with the motor 2.
creations-chat 2021-04-28 01:39:47 Perfect!
creations-chat 2021-04-28 01:42:04 That isn't necessary, but yeah I think it looks a lot better ngl
creations-chat 2021-04-28 02:29:52 It would look good, so go for it!
creations-chat 2021-04-28 04:25:18 Yeah, I'm loving that camo and the thin intake!
creations-chat 2021-05-03 08:02:55 Thoughts on this Little Bird?
creations-chat 2021-05-03 08:14:36 Front
creations-chat 2021-05-03 08:19:35 Thank you! It might be the fact that it's actually 2 blocks wide and not 3, so it seems really funky.
creations-chat 2021-05-03 08:23:10 Thank you again!
creations-chat 2021-05-03 12:23:53 <@!379257519593357313> very nice R3 !
creations-chat 2021-05-03 12:26:03 Yea, the color is nice, and the hover thruster headlights and windshield framing are great touches.
creations-chat 2021-07-05 02:20:41 Oh that looks cool
creations-chat 2021-07-06 13:48:42 Pretty sure it has black 1x4 delta wings on it, just very hard to see
creations-chat 2021-07-06 13:53:13 Pants milk<:Yikes:704804144657203220>
creations-chat 2021-07-14 05:13:40 even that one? Jeeze
