bug-reports 2023-07-07 04:49:12 theyre flying without any input ae
bug-reports 2023-07-07 04:49:26 RICKJE!!!!!!
bug-reports 2023-07-07 04:51:31 rickje MY MOTORS ARE BROKEN GY
bug-reports 2023-07-07 04:56:39 rickje destroying the fragile game pc1 is rn
bug-reports 2023-07-09 19:00:44 I think that might just be too much ping
bug-reports 2023-07-09 19:00:56 I cant load my boat either anymore too
bug-reports 2023-07-09 19:01:09 Ping goes to like 40k now
bug-reports 2023-07-13 04:17:38 man after the newest  pc update my 20k boat has no chance of loading anymore
bug-reports 2023-07-13 04:17:49 ping spikes to like 20k and the thing never loads
bug-reports 2023-07-13 04:18:22 before then it loaded fine albeit with 3 fps and a lot of motor teleportation
bug-reports 2023-07-13 04:18:58 but now even my 5k boat is spiking near 5k ping
bug-reports 2023-07-13 16:21:46 SAME
bug-reports 2023-07-13 16:21:59 Im gonna post a video later
bug-reports 2023-07-13 16:22:16 Ever since the lag fix update ping has been a massive issue now
bug-reports 2023-07-13 16:23:06 Anda its not laggy server either
bug-reports 2023-07-13 16:23:12 I tested this in a vip server
bug-reports 2023-07-13 16:23:29 And this problem only started after rickje updated the game
bug-reports 2023-07-13 16:33:47 No
bug-reports 2023-07-13 16:33:49 Only 4
bug-reports 2023-07-13 16:34:00 Its like a 5k boat that i didnt even finish
bug-reports 2023-07-13 16:34:22 Only my massive 20k one has like. A billion moving parts
bug-reports 2023-07-13 16:42:07 Yeah ill post a video later
bug-reports 2023-07-13 16:43:19 Generally yeah for anything that isnt super laggy everything works pretty well
bug-reports 2023-07-13 16:43:34 But i guess after a certain point the game just refuses to load
bug-reports 2023-07-13 16:43:42 Such as a massive 20k boat with many moving parts
bug-reports 2023-07-13 16:44:25 It does load but to complete the folding process i need to explode tnt to lock all the angles in place
bug-reports 2023-07-13 16:44:40 Then thats where the game freezes eternally
bug-reports 2023-07-13 16:44:48 I do this in a vip server alone
bug-reports 2023-07-13 16:46:15 Alr one moment then
bug-reports 2023-07-13 16:50:05 Slot number 3, m to fold the large folds, b and n to start angling the angles and f to explode
 username: exf1nity
bug-reports 2023-07-13 16:50:21 3 is the anchor key
bug-reports 2023-07-13 16:50:50 Although i bet you could replicate the freeze by just exploding it immediately if you find the folding process too time consuming
bug-reports 2023-07-13 16:51:04 It isnt very fast to prevent motor teleportation
