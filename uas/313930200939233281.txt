creations-chat 2019-01-25 22:59:06 
creations-chat 2019-01-26 22:37:13 Introducing the FINAL version of my Starship Superheavy. 
Total Blocks: 2095
Booster Max Speed: 700SPS (Roughly)
Starship Max Speed: 560SPS (Roughly)
Total time to build: 12 hours-ish

Functionality: Slots together on the ground and uprights itself. Lifts off, reaches a good hieght, and then the Starship detaches. Starship ascends more and then levels out, releasing a payload. Then it glides back to the spawnplate and lands on wheels.

Potentially reusable, i could technically reconnect the ship to the booster and re-fly it.

Requesting Lag Machine role :D

the-dump 2019-03-20 14:13:17 I don't know if anyone of you gets this meme but it's so frickin' funny. Let me explain it to you if you're not educated enough in chemistry or you don't watch Richard and Mortimer. The second chemist was very clever about what he said because he wanted H2O too, but he said also. If he had said "too", the waiter would give him H2O2, because "too" sounds like "two". H2O2 is hydrogen peroxide from which you can die if you rink it so the chemist 2 saved himself. I literally can't stop laughing about how cleverly he got himself out of that situation and that the "waiter" must've been really
