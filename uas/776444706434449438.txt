creations-chat 2021-06-16 18:07:42 Use this https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/f22-raptor-f7e8ca7bd6ee404a9653aa3af0c25b81
creations-chat 2021-06-16 18:09:55 Just use the 3d model. It is way easier and looks better because that is a different model of f22 and is not aesthetic
creations-chat 2021-06-16 18:13:51 I just think it is the lack of being finished is what is making it look bad. If you think it would look better moving the wings up I would.
