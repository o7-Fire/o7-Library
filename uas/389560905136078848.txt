help 2022-01-08 00:38:00 can someone help me with my tanks hull
help 2022-01-08 00:38:08 i got a vip dm me if you wanna help
help 2022-01-08 00:38:42 oh i used to have a build just like this but it was shredder fodder
help 2022-01-08 00:39:06 are you saying that to me?
help 2022-01-08 00:39:31 thats the idea but it ended up uhh
help 2022-01-08 00:39:56 im very bad at copying
help 2022-01-08 00:40:11 this was supposed to be a t-90
help 2022-01-08 00:40:25 or sort of like a t-90
help 2022-01-08 00:40:40 it ended up looking ugly
help 2022-01-08 00:40:42 like me
help 2022-01-08 00:40:52 
help 2022-01-08 00:41:47 bruh
help 2022-01-08 00:46:44 <@!911457409631932448> search up on youtube mousecontrolled turret
help 2022-01-08 00:47:22 and then realize your "tank" looks like you put no effort into it and copied the first step of every tank tutorial made
help 2022-01-08 00:47:39 and even thats a compliment to you
help 2022-01-08 00:49:05 if you put 2 hours then i put my entire life into making the tutorial plane
help 2022-01-08 00:49:45 also that looks nothing like a t72 which is most likely why you cant make the turret
help 2022-01-08 00:49:48 wheres the base
help 2022-01-08 00:49:56 wheres the turret box
help 2022-01-08 00:50:13 notice the top part
help 2022-01-08 00:50:21 notice the wheel armor
help 2022-01-08 00:50:26 then show it dumbass
help 2022-01-08 00:51:18 cant help them with their problem if their problem cant be fixed without changing the build
help 2022-01-08 00:51:52 ok i see the turret box now but its very small
help 2022-01-08 00:52:14 you need to make the box bigger to accompany motors so you can make the turret move
help 2022-01-08 00:52:21 make it wider and longer
help 2022-01-08 00:52:44 now that i think about it you should prob redo the tank
help 2022-01-08 00:52:59 you dont have enough space for a turret
help 2022-01-08 00:53:12 well i mean the turret you want
help 2022-01-08 00:53:51 <@!911457409631932448> think of it like this
help 2022-01-08 00:53:58 you want space for the motors and all
help 2022-01-08 00:54:06 and the turret is one of the biggest parts of a tank
help 2022-01-08 00:54:14 you need room to make a turret
help 2022-01-08 00:54:26 <@!799798067024101396> true
help 2022-01-08 00:54:38 tobe honest i dont know if i can be considered help though
help 2022-01-08 00:55:04 considering what im trying to make looks kinda bad
help 2022-01-08 00:55:33 <@!911457409631932448> you cant make a nice tank if you dont know how to make a base
help 2022-01-08 00:55:48 heres my ideas of steps in a tank
help 2022-01-08 00:55:54 make the wheels
help 2022-01-08 00:55:55 then the base
help 2022-01-08 00:56:11 make one side of the wheels connect with another side
help 2022-01-08 00:56:15 on that make your base
help 2022-01-08 00:56:33 true
