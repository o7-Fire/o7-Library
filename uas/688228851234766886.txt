creations-chat 2021-12-30 07:34:59 4/10 the top back is a bit too tall, and theres these sloped insets that you missed. youve got the general shape down though.
creations-chat 2021-12-30 07:38:33 also you forgot the ramp and the 2 guns on both sides.

help 2022-01-01 02:09:16 for the terrain specialist rank, does it need to have the wheels turn for left-right movement or can it be rockets/propellers?
creations-chat 2022-01-01 02:10:23 oh ok but should i change the saw thing
creations-chat 2022-01-01 02:15:07 thank you
help 2022-01-01 02:23:47 its easier to use rockets than to design a wheel guard thing that lets the wheels turn
