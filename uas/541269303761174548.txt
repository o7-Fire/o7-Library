bug-reports 2020-12-27 00:20:14 **Multiple piston problems**

- when using multiple piston they aren't synced when they have the same key bind
- if you have a platform attached to the piston when you activate it sometimes it will spaze out and turn sideways or upside down 
- sometimes when extending the piston if its attached to something it will fling whatever its attached to and occasionally the entire  build
- if you extend the pistons with someone else's build on it sometimes it will fling
-   also if you extend the pistons with someone else's build on it it will move very slowly

- also not for sure if this is a bug or not but the amount of blocks it says the piston will extend in the config menu is not true it only extends to about half that

(for context all of these bug where found while I was using aircraft lifts on multiple different aircraft carriers I've built in past week)

- sincerely a guy who flung his friends jet into the great beyond multiple time this week
bug-reports 2020-12-27 00:22:47 I assure you good sir what I'm talking about  (the second one) definitely is a bug
bug-reports 2020-12-27 00:23:55 Ill send screenshots next time it happens

bug-reports 2021-06-11 19:24:01 description: large flying objects flinging into the abyss
bug-reports 2021-06-11 19:25:38 steps to recreate: build a large flying object which uses helium and folds into its usable form then try to fly it
bug-reports 2021-06-11 19:27:56 oh and in the image that's supposed to be a 4k+ block zeppelin which has flung and glitched ^
bug-reports 2021-06-11 19:31:48 its was very awesome considering there was also 3 other people on board
creations-chat 2021-06-11 21:33:53 thanks my guy
bug-reports 2021-06-11 23:13:44 It's glitchyness I've only seen in plane crazy
bug-reports 2021-06-11 23:14:11 Everything turns into a rhombus

creations-chat 2021-06-14 21:49:03 ok
the-dump 2021-06-14 22:51:21 
creations-chat 2021-06-14 22:59:33 You might  be able to use half blocks to make it so they don't show but personally I think it looks fine the way it is
creations-chat 2021-06-14 23:28:47 Are you kidding me why the fuck do you people care so much about someone else's design choices ü§¢
creations-chat 2021-06-14 23:31:15 Ok well maybe he wants it that way maybe his whole goal was to make a jet with turrets who are you to decide whether or whether not it was a good idea
creations-chat 2021-06-14 23:34:58 That is not a critique that is borderline insult a critique is simply saying that it seems unnecessary
creations-chat 2021-06-14 23:38:25 It's not when people have the choice of what they want to put on their fighter jets that is the whole purpose of the game its not to build exact replicas of stuff that already exists its to build somthing your own and be creative
creations-chat 2021-06-14 23:41:42 Bro shredder bugs are exact replicas of stuff that already exist you idiot <:wait:652565313337950230>

Also yeah that link sus as all get out
creations-chat 2021-06-14 23:43:45 They not creative at all people literally copy them down from YT videos
creations-chat 2021-06-15 00:14:12 It's was also a vtol for some reason (I got image just gotta get past this timer)

I'm just saying the puke emoji and the "what the fuck were you thinking" was unnecessary toxicity
creations-chat 2021-06-15 00:16:45 It's a fine build just not a f15
creations-chat 2021-06-15 00:19:34 <:trollface:775024642104229898>
creations-chat 2021-06-15 00:22:20 Yeah its not idk what he was talking bout
help 2021-06-15 00:24:32 Hover thrusters might work but if you want somthing more complex you could try any of the other ways of getting stuff to move (propellers, rocket engines, jet engines n stuff)
help 2021-06-15 00:24:44 With motors
help 2021-06-15 00:24:55 So you can turn
creations-chat 2021-06-15 00:25:40 It's not bad it's just not a f15 there was clearly a good effort made in the build 

But it does look good it has complex shape its kinda sleek you just don't care cuz f15 :nooo:
help 2021-06-15 00:26:53 I'm assuming your putting the hover thingies where the tires are so I don't think like a helicopter propeller type situation would work
help 2021-06-15 00:28:45 Oh well that might work
help 2021-06-15 00:28:56 Oh dang
help 2021-06-15 00:29:04 don't really do helicopter so idk
creations-chat 2021-06-15 00:30:15 You don't care because he miss labeled it and your one of those everything has to be accurate or it's bad type of guys who like to hang out and degrade people's work in this channel
help 2021-06-15 00:30:57 That's good idea
help 2021-06-15 00:31:11 I only do hover

creations-chat 2021-06-15 21:01:40 Ok
creations-chat 2021-06-15 21:04:12 Yeah the mods gotta declare you worthy
creations-chat 2021-06-15 21:06:15 Gotten <:trollface:775024642104229898>
help 2021-06-15 21:06:51 Are we able to appeal a suggestions blacklist I think I caught the mods in a bad mood that day
help 2021-06-15 21:07:11 I just suggested a new map
help 2021-06-15 21:13:26 Yeah still doesn't deserve a blacklist
help 2021-06-15 21:14:17 Someone literally suggested a hall of shame for creations channel that like straight up bullying that needs blacklist
bug-reports 2021-06-15 22:48:15 There was no cameras on the build so idk
bug-reports 2021-06-16 04:20:46 
bug-reports 2021-06-16 04:21:12 Prolly a skill issue my bad
creations-chat 2021-09-15 23:45:45 I put small propellers in the ballon part
creations-chat 2021-09-15 23:50:47 I've put small propellers in the balloon part it has a forward and back prop along with 4 near the center used for rotating and a up and down prop 

It can be a bit tricky to use without losing control so it also has 3 anchor blocks 2 on side and 1 in ballon but if you use it with the anchors between major motions it flys smoothly

It has a down prop but the ropes can be used to go down if your in range of ground
creations-chat 2021-09-15 23:52:54 I'd send build mode but this is currently my internet speed test committed not living like half a hour ago
creations-chat 2021-09-15 23:57:36 Yeah the build mode is basically the normal balloon but the roped anchors come out to side 

The inside of the balloon is hollow except for a + shapped support which all the props are on
creations-chat 2021-09-16 00:33:49 I think this was all a trick like its not a solvable cube its just a cube that can turn slightly then the player replaces some colours and then the screenshots look like its being solved
creations-chat 2021-09-16 01:03:15 Yeah üíÄ
