This is for a machine gun mount
creations-chat 2021-09-29 01:30:29 Idk how 
Should I make it like a marksman (semi auto) turret and use pistons
Like per click it pushes the turret back
creations-chat 2021-09-29 01:32:34 Wait I think I know how I can make it simulate recoil
creations-chat 2021-09-29 01:51:18 So I managed to make it go back and 
forth
Problem is in first person it‚Äôs not noticeable https://streamable.com/whgo1b
creations-chat 2021-09-29 01:53:32 I‚Äôll try

creations-chat 2021-09-29 03:31:17 https://streamable.com/b0g8qq https://streamable.com/kzjsu8
Do y‚Äôall see a difference in recoil
creations-chat 2021-09-29 03:33:53 Yeah I‚Äôm trying to find a way to reduce the recoil 
I‚Äôm thinking about turning down the speed of the motors
creations-chat 2021-09-29 03:41:14 Further back?
And which motors the top ones
creations-chat 2021-09-29 20:59:41 So I‚Äôm thinking about removing the upwards recoil gimmick since normally turrets don‚Äôt have upwards recoil
What do y‚Äôall think
creations-chat 2021-09-29 21:01:53 Alright then
Removing it it is
creations-chat 2021-09-30 00:00:36 Making a turret this time with reciprocating barrel
What do y‚Äôall think of these iron sights
creations-chat 2021-09-30 00:04:05 So you know those suspension slingshots?
I‚Äôm making the barrel reciprocate by using that but just making the barrel go back and forth
creations-chat 2021-09-30 00:25:34 It‚Äôs like the barrel of the M107

<@!619312093962829849> how can I fix the rectangular
creations-chat 2021-10-21 03:03:52 That‚Äôs a good idea
The problem is is that the wedges could cause friction against the back treads and it could potentially detrack it
I could use ice but the edges could get jammed into the treads
That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs rectangular
creations-chat 2021-10-21 03:07:22 Speaking of which I might as well come up with a name based off of its rectangular shape

I just started on it https://streamable.com/zkyqsf
help 2021-11-18 04:51:35 There‚Äôs a bit of bouncing when the long section comes down
help 2021-11-18 04:51:49 But that‚Äôs probably because of the motors that rotate in on the wheels
help 2021-11-19 04:35:45 https://streamable.com/db9kv8 is this somewhat a good ‚Äútransformers‚Äù

help 2021-11-21 02:10:45 So I‚Äôm designing this transformer, and so far I‚Äôm trying to build the legs before going on with the upper torso 
Problem is I‚Äôm having issues with designing the legs and I already tried the ‚Äúadvanced‚Äù mech legs but they didn‚Äôt work
Should I switch to the classic chicken legs or just abort this build
And a little more context I‚Äôm trying to make legs that fold but are still functional for walking

help 2021-12-12 03:24:17 So please ignore the fact that my ‚Äútransformer‚Äù is high on crack and convulsing
Should I find a way to place a head on this? https://streamable.com/t7x7rk
help 2021-12-12 03:24:46 Oh no
I‚Äôm afraid I might get roasted for this
help 2021-12-12 03:25:23 But where
help 2021-12-12 03:25:40 Uh
help 2021-12-12 03:25:46 I can‚Äôt place it on the crotch
help 2021-12-12 03:25:51 So scrap that
help 2021-12-12 03:25:57 Even if I used trails
help 2021-12-12 03:26:11 There wouldn‚Äôt be enough room to place motors and pistons
help 2021-12-13 01:22:56 So I somehow managed to find a way to put a head on this
I tried to make it look like a forward light in vehicle mode but guess I‚Äôll have to do a better job
help 2021-12-13 01:23:09 Disappointedly it doesn‚Äôt move (referring to the head)
help 2021-12-13 01:23:21 But hey at least its got a head now
help 2021-12-13 01:23:32 I‚Äôm tryna make a ‚Äútransformer‚Äù
help 2021-12-13 01:23:46 What I‚Äôm heavily disappointed about is that it can‚Äôt move when it‚Äôs in robot form
help 2021-12-13 01:24:09 But maybe in the future I might try to make a decent looking transformer that can move in robot form without being so glitchy

help 2022-05-22 08:23:13 As reference yeah

creations-chat 2022-11-23 01:46:48 <@959618055560912907> I like the simple popup spoiler
Not often you see someone put active spoiler mechanisms on here
Also Ford GTS?
creations-chat 2022-11-23 01:53:13 Hm yes
Also how tf did you manage to make the spoiler motor not get attached to the panel without motor locking 
Along with the signs staying in the same position even when the spoiler‚Äôs slanted
creations-chat 2022-11-23 01:56:45 Control panels made sense
Signs I‚Äôm guessing you just placed them away from the spoiler a few blocks away, then motor locked them in?
creations-chat 2022-12-06 00:29:37 <@334903399709671445> your mini suspension build will bless many other smol builds
creations-chat 2022-12-06 04:28:00 <@334903399709671445> (sorry for ping)
Everyone is copying your suspension, told ya it‚Äôll bless the small builds
creations-chat 2022-12-06 04:30:03 But in all seriousness (pun unintended) you prob jsut invented a compact suspension system that‚Äôs actually decent and quick to build
You need that inventor role *now*
creations-chat 2022-12-06 04:32:58 *Y e s*
Trust me, one day you‚Äôll be seeing handfuls of people with that system on their ATVs and whatnot
I‚Äôm actually trying to copy it rn lol, but don‚Äôt worry I‚Äôll be sure to credit you (not submitting, just if somebody asks if I made it)
creations-chat 2022-12-06 04:38:01 Can‚Äôt find it, but I‚Äôm just saying again
Your susp system is great
creations-chat 2022-12-06 04:44:13 Heepla Suspension System is what we‚Äôre gonna call this now
creations-chat 2022-12-06 04:46:46 <@334903399709671445> so I‚Äôm tryna replicate your system
Problem is idk what kind of motors your using for the arm joints
Are they motor 2 or something?
creations-chat 2022-12-06 05:19:14 <@334903399709671445> question
When did you make the suspension
creations-chat 2022-12-06 05:22:15 Oh okay
Thing is I just met a guy named MR_starplatnuim that had a near identical system
Says he made it 2 weeks ago
creations-chat 2022-12-06 05:24:18 Guess I‚Äôm wrong then
