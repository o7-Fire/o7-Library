I want this jet to fly for my christmas presant!

The speed is up, but the rockets aint on! It is W and S!
bug-reports 2020-12-23 11:59:07 My games crashed when you sent that message <@!330365250597552129>
bug-reports 2020-12-23 17:29:17 It worked when I rejoined, just a glitch prob. But my jet wont fly! It only drives by the ground. So I am going to make a FN-16 instead of a 15.
bug-reports 2020-12-23 17:30:34 4 rocket back. 9 jet engines, that's all my power. Everyone pointing front.
