creations-chat 2020-06-11 16:46:52 I need someone to give me a name for my rocket
creations-chat 2020-06-11 16:48:50 The only downside to my rocket is it can't yaw
creations-chat 2020-06-11 16:48:59 I originally made it to do so
creations-chat 2020-06-11 16:49:13 But it was too much for the rocket and it would always flip
creations-chat 2020-06-11 16:49:20 So I scratched the idea
help 2020-06-11 16:52:50 I need to make my rocket have a stable yaw capability, but idk how.
