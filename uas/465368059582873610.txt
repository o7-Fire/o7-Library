The Tale of kilts (465368059582873610)
help 2021-02-15 17:45:04 Hey there! So I've been playing for 4 years now and I specialize in Star Wars builds. I have built a working scale model of Slave 1 with a full interior that flies in gravity with no shenainigans, BUT this small project is putting me through the ringer. This little drop ship I am building turns the wrong way. It uses standard control surfaces and it flies, rolls the right way, but turns the opposite direction. If my mouse goes right, it will roll right and turn left. The wing panels and control surfaces sit above the fuselage. I can't post images sadly. I joined the server for this issue specifically since my builds don't usually fall into what is considered worth while around here as far as I've heard. Does anyone have any idea why this thing turns the wrong way? Much obliged!
help 2021-02-15 17:46:28 Yeah for sure, but custom one's really aren't going to work on this
help 2021-02-15 17:46:34 yes I do lol
help 2021-02-15 17:47:04 the vertical stabilizer?
help 2021-02-15 17:47:23 ok thanks I'll try that and report back
help 2021-02-15 19:20:07 Power went out. Texas power grid is rolling power in and out because of weather. Getting back on to enlarge the vertical stabilizers now
help 2021-02-15 19:34:31 Oh maybe it's just central Texas where they're doing it
help 2021-02-15 19:34:53 aight well <@!719168864705052802> <@!705533053740777584> it works now! Thanks so much for the help!
help 2021-02-16 13:26:51 Itâ€™s the help channel and nobody knows me. So yeah Iâ€™m going to thoroughly explain. If you donâ€™t have time to read a paragraph or two then donâ€™t lmfao
help 2021-02-16 21:10:46 Not for what I do. Our server is way more active and fun than Star Crazy was. Don't get your knickers in a twist lol. I got the ship working I just needed a larger vertical stabilizer.

help 2021-02-17 23:39:01 Hey so how does the ranking work? Like how do we prove that we've met requirements? Do we go into a server and demonstrate or...
help 2021-02-17 23:40:32 ok thanks
help 2021-02-22 20:59:07 So is it not possible to make a copilot seat in Plane Crazy or do they just not want to do it?
help 2021-03-15 03:08:03 Do ballast tanks only work underwater? Never had to use them before so I have no idea

creations-chat 2021-05-16 23:34:57 Lmao confederate flag ðŸ˜‚
creations-chat 2021-05-16 23:37:39 Not even proper flag code on that tail (and again CSA, not offended just funny)
creations-chat 2021-05-16 23:40:50 <@!299698224980164608> https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/384025409945337856/843558279300644864 looks great man! I would make the color lighter and  add the gold, as well as just put some different greys on there. Try to smooth out the top as well, and if youâ€™re going for scale I think thatâ€™s a bit too big speaking from my own Razorcrest build. Keep up the good work!
creations-chat 2021-05-16 23:42:58 Yeah, if he wants to keep it at that expanded size for detail, I would probably use motors to shape that but with wing panels. On mine I just did triangle wedges and wedge blocks since the scale size makes it too cramped for motor shaping.
creations-chat 2021-05-16 23:50:38 Then put wing panels on a motor and move to a flush angle
creations-chat 2021-05-17 23:03:35 Amogus thatâ€™s why
