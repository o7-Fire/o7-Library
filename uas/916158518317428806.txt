the-dump 2022-01-19 23:41:41 where's the laser
the-dump 2022-01-19 23:42:01 it looks good
the-dump 2022-01-19 23:42:28 why does everyone here insult people's builds
the-dump 2022-01-19 23:43:52 people just can't enjoy their hard work without getting insulted
the-dump 2022-01-19 23:44:13 sigh

bot-central 2022-01-19 23:48:23 so close
the-dump 2022-01-19 23:48:45 no

the-dump 2022-01-19 23:53:22 there's multiple flaws with your logic
the-dump 2022-01-19 23:54:13 first of all, it depends more on skill than effort. for example me at math, i have no skill at it but i try my hardest and still get bad grades
the-dump 2022-01-19 23:55:02 siight
the-dump 2022-01-19 23:55:10 see i cant even spell
the-dump 2022-01-19 23:56:00 so i think this is why this server is called the dump
the-dump 2022-01-19 23:56:44 thanks for correcting me. also, that was a joke

creations-chat 2022-01-20 00:06:23 its hard okay
creations-chat 2022-01-20 00:08:50 apparently every single build that doesn't have hyper-advanced motorlocking is terrible
creations-chat 2022-05-23 01:34:23 why is this the most toxic discord server that exists
creations-chat 2022-05-23 01:41:29 you and middy are exactly right, there's so many other building servers i've joined like this one that have amazing feedback and no toxicity at all
creations-chat 2022-05-23 01:43:18 ok yeah i'm out
