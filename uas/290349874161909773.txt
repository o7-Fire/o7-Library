help 2022-10-31 20:09:12 I believe sparklers were a previous event item. It's listed on the wiki, just cba to find it atm
help 2022-10-31 20:13:42 The way you asked if it was a winter event item made me think you were implying an upcoming winter event. Just didn't want you to get your hopes up. Idk if they recycle them, doesn't seem so from what I've seen.
help 2022-10-31 20:24:40 What is the tip jar Gamepass for? I just can't imagine being able to actually "tip" bobux to other players and there is no in-game currency... There doesn't seem to be a "Passes" section in the game page that usually provides descriptions.
