help 2021-09-01 09:56:43 anyone know how to make dis better
help 2021-09-01 09:58:25 like its basically kind of the same tbh
help 2021-09-01 10:01:01 I don't think that'll magically make all the downvotes upvotes
help 2021-09-01 10:06:52 cant really do that now that im trying it
help 2021-09-01 10:07:27 cuz it'll mean I basically need to redo everything kinda besides the nose and wings ands tuff
help 2021-09-01 11:15:07 id rather start building a different plane
help 2021-09-01 11:19:25 like its not possible to make round wings at the ends too
help 2021-09-01 11:19:43 cant use the round corner wedges cuz then the wing will be kinda thicc at the end of it
help 2021-09-01 11:20:29 i could make the wings made out of half blocks which makes the end not look as weird as it would look like wing panels
help 2021-09-01 11:23:49 the wings I can fix
help 2021-09-01 11:24:04 idk why people haven't mentioned the engines not being that low
help 2021-09-01 11:24:07 and the landing gear
help 2021-09-01 11:25:04 cant fix the engines being like connected to the aircraft cuz not enough space
help 2021-09-01 11:57:04 the tail and wings I can fix
