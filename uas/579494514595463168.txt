creations-chat 2023-06-05 06:57:44 i need more ideas for this "please give ideas but dont give me stupid ideas" (based off the Meteoro-class offshore patrol vessel)
creations-chat 2023-06-05 08:10:01 good idea but for the cannon possibly not its more for pvp
creations-chat 2023-06-05 08:15:04 I‚Äôll check that out tomorrow but I‚Äôll definitely try and add some detail to the bridge windows
creations-chat 2023-06-05 08:19:53 Not much you can really do about the way mechs walk It mostly comes down to how fluidly the legs move and the surface area of the feet

creations-chat 2023-06-05 17:12:51 Indeed
creations-chat 2023-06-05 17:15:02 Because shredders are idiotic and built by peoples who‚Äôs mother drank and smoke while they were in the womb
creations-chat 2023-06-05 17:18:12 That doesn‚Äôt change the fact it‚Äôs a shredder
creations-chat 2023-06-05 19:13:26 do you know how to make those?
creations-chat 2023-06-06 02:50:44 The goober 35 obviously
creations-chat 2023-06-06 02:56:09 its literally 3 wide <:kalskull:993609557765005342>
creations-chat 2023-06-06 02:59:25 show
creations-chat 2023-06-06 03:49:12 hence why i said the goober-35B
creations-chat 2023-06-06 05:12:16 i actually chose the green for pvp. because i found out if you have that green underwater its almost invisble
creations-chat 2023-06-06 05:21:14 but not underwater
creations-chat 2023-06-06 05:29:31 well the green makes it blend into the flooring
creations-chat 2023-06-06 15:27:13 Old photos and I dont think the shaders work anymore

creations-chat 2023-06-09 19:06:51 thats quite the nice hull but could use a little more personality
creations-chat 2023-06-09 19:10:56 yeah work on the sides and see if you can make them more curvy but overall its nice
