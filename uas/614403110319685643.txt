creations-chat 2020-12-22 14:09:28 y do some builds get mass downvotes despite not looking bad? Is it because they are tutorials or something

creations-chat 2021-02-24 15:39:01 I like the shape of that jet
creations-chat 2021-02-25 09:27:37 That was a very nice blackbrid
creations-chat 2021-02-25 09:29:42 Also do those jetskis work on their own?
creations-chat 2021-02-25 09:32:22 wow you're so funny wow im actually crying of laughter lmao lmao lol XD XD XD XD XD lmao

(the plane was very nice though)
creations-chat 2021-02-25 09:50:32 Ok while i liked your sr-71, the yacht is 1 million times better. The detailing is amazing. The only bit im not too fond of is the pointy nose but thats a design choice the creator just wanted to make
creations-chat 2021-02-25 09:54:28 do the jetskis work?
creations-chat 2021-02-25 09:57:43 at least they kinda work lol
creations-chat 2021-02-25 10:01:50 also another random question but could a helicopter land on that helipad
creations-chat 2021-02-25 10:04:14 thats cool with the helicopter. The boat must be pretty big for tht heli to land on it too
creations-chat 2021-02-25 10:07:55 <@456226577798135808>  i really like the general shape of that jet, especially with the wings being so close to the tail
creations-chat 2021-02-25 10:12:15 that extra image really helps btw. you cant really see the droopy nose on your first image
bug-reports 2021-02-25 10:17:11 sometimes when you have a creation with motors, they randomly detach from the rest of your build and make it freak out. Most of the time if you get your build close to the motors they reattacjh but they sometimes go underground meaning you have to reload
creations-chat 2021-02-25 10:18:23 ok guys dont bully the guy.

Are you gonna build a shark with the cage?
creations-chat 2021-02-25 10:20:45 singlerpl will u build a big shark
creations-chat 2021-02-25 10:22:47 ok first of all the guy just wanted feedback and second of all the whole point of downvotes is so that you can get feedback rather than just mindlessly accepting it and moving on.
creations-chat 2021-02-25 10:33:22 woah cool discovery
creations-chat 2021-02-26 15:45:13 wait what did they build anyways
creations-chat 2021-03-01 13:44:46 taht is a massive and very cool carrier. Maybe removing that random seat at the front and putting it somewhere else unless its supposed to be there
