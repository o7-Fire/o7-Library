creations-chat 2022-08-24 05:34:06 One question, are you going to expand the map in the near future?
creations-chat 2022-08-24 05:37:20 I think he's been working on it for a few years
creations-chat 2022-08-24 06:16:21 I was trying to create the hercules recently

creations-chat 2022-10-23 21:48:27 What do you think of this prototype of c 130 hercules that could change it?
creations-chat 2022-10-23 21:50:48 That's what I work on based on the nose of your Hercules
creations-chat 2022-10-23 22:07:58 What could I do to improve it? I don't know how to use angle lock or anything like that, although I learn more and more how I could improve it. It's not a c 130j, it's a c 130H.
creations-chat 2022-10-30 00:18:27 I tried that but it is very high if it is already high it would be higher the truth is I tried to do the best I could I was working on it I saw the original model and a small part of the wheel is hidden
creations-chat 2022-10-30 03:57:32 does it really look good? what could change?
creations-chat 2022-10-30 04:00:06 I could not do more there was the most real nose that remained among a lot of failed nosesI could not do more there was the most real nose that remained among a lot of failed noses something else?
creations-chat 2022-11-02 04:19:49 a 3x3 interior is good for a c 130?
creations-chat 2022-11-03 01:03:39 One question Does the Creator not have time to fix the bug when you want to paint a text? either he does not have time or it is very complex to fix that
creations-chat 2022-11-03 01:06:52 I forgot to say it, forgive my ignorance, they already told me that twice, well, how long do you think it will take to fix that problem? Roblox doesn't even care about big mistakes... I wonder why not continue with the first version? upgrade it imagine seeing what you have built in Plane crazy on a new Plane crazy map in the same game

creations-chat 2022-11-08 23:29:57 Someone tell me what this is?
creations-chat 2022-11-09 00:13:32 is rather an experiment and if they are the super hornet since yesterday I have worked with that I will not make the plane it was only a prototype
creations-chat 2022-11-17 01:16:23 It is in white because it is a Prototype for some reason I like to leave it blank Although I lose more since it will take longer to paint it
creations-chat 2022-11-17 01:18:40 Does the window look good there? The window does not let me continue with the project a week ago due to doubts

creations-chat 2022-11-19 21:30:00 Where?
creations-chat 2022-11-19 21:32:04 I don't know if I should keep the window in the middle The real plane has that many windows.
creations-chat 2022-11-19 21:41:31 The windows don't look bad?
