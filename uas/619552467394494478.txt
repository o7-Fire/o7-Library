help 2021-11-08 09:39:36 plus just do the ranks if you dont like the upvote system
creations-chat 2021-11-11 16:42:00 maybe use a hoverdrive? It gets rid of the rocket engine particles. The landing gear looks a bit thick and i would make a custom propeller. otherwise good \:)
creations-chat 2021-11-11 16:45:27 make it longer then or motorlock more into the plane.

creations-chat 2022-02-09 07:25:49 the turret looks kinda too long and maybe try to hide the top of the wheels/add tracks? I just personally think that looks better
creations-chat 2022-02-09 07:28:41 use motorlock to make fake tracks :/
creations-chat 2022-02-09 07:37:04 if you want a better looking tank then add fake tracks and the part ontop of the wheels is too thick (supposed to be thinner). also colour the back of the wheels a bit darker cause it looks very odd having the same colour as the hull.
otherwise cool build B)
