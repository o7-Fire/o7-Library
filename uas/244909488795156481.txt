|Name|
LaWodonaise's BWP No.1
|Description|
The first model of a serie of Vortex Fighter hommages, the No.1 has served the fundations for the next variations. The final model has been the result of a long line of attempts to control the monstrous engine blasting the plane in no time. Quite difficult to control due to the massive propulsion, but is without a double capable to outrun most aircrafts with speed alone.
