creations-chat 2022-02-14 22:26:13 how does it being old determine if i can post it or not?
creations-chat 2022-02-24 15:21:32 Im finishing off my T-34/85. The turret is shit so go nuts if i post it

creations-chat 2022-02-24 15:32:59 Ja
creations-chat 2022-02-24 16:26:22 Agreed
creations-chat 2022-02-24 16:29:13 Shit my turret is too short
creations-chat 2022-02-24 16:33:13 Sorry its only because i just realised it
creations-chat 2022-03-20 13:44:58 wow there are alot of messages since i last spoke on here
creations-chat 2022-03-26 12:00:26 May i ask for any feedback on this bow section im building?

creations-chat 2022-03-26 12:06:40 No

creations-chat 2022-04-21 18:51:02 The battleship?
creations-chat 2022-04-21 18:52:44 1: it has the underside hull colours of red and black and 2: most battleships were grey or a darker shade to act as a form of camouflage.
creations-chat 2022-04-21 18:54:31 That was by accident as i used smoke emitters to make the illusion of a barrel
creations-chat 2022-04-21 18:56:12 Im guessing i should of used black circle emojis? And btw every setting on the emitters was set so that the emitters wouldnt emit.
creations-chat 2022-04-21 18:59:15 So is it just the smoke i should pay some attention to or is there anything else. Im ignoring the "add more colour" message.
creations-chat 2022-04-21 19:02:11 Did you read about what i said about "camouflage" ships like this were painted that way as to try and not draw attention from a distance. Unlike lets say a coast guard boat that is coloured vibrantly to attract attention.
creations-chat 2022-04-21 19:04:27 But thanks anyways for the feedback
creations-chat 2022-04-21 19:06:09 Yo heard of landships? They existed in WW1. They are called tanks nowadays
creations-chat 2022-04-21 19:07:50 Yes but this doesnt answer the message about it being bland af.
creations-chat 2022-04-21 19:09:32 That would imply the deck being made of wood. A great example of wood being unreliable as a deck and horizontal defense was the sinking of HMS Hood
creations-chat 2022-04-21 19:11:48 Read the caption i wrote about it sherlock. Its a mix between WW2 ship design and modern design aka THE DECK
creations-chat 2022-04-21 19:13:32 Alright calm down. Crikey.
creations-chat 2022-04-21 19:15:49 Look at the deck of an arleigh burke class destroyer. It practically has the same deck colour.
creations-chat 2022-04-21 19:19:01 Aight fine then i'll do something about it. My god these people are getting all bothered about a ships colours. Im being calm about it.
creations-chat 2022-04-21 19:28:19 True true
creations-chat 2022-04-21 19:35:40 How's this
creations-chat 2022-04-21 19:38:37 RIP your self confidence
creations-chat 2022-04-21 19:40:29 Look at your own name colour before saying anything ._.
creations-chat 2022-04-21 19:42:20 its a bit too wide in the mid section of the hull. but thats my opinion.

help 2022-04-22 14:34:58 Ah ok thanks
help 2022-04-22 14:35:26 Oh ok
creations-chat 2022-04-23 16:57:04 dont worry this is usually how the PCC respond to things. but meh what i do is just put up with it and try and be kind.
creations-chat 2022-04-23 16:58:46 What the flying fuck is that meant to be?!
creations-chat 2022-04-25 20:14:15 tonk
creations-chat 2022-04-26 07:11:57 Epic airships my guy
creations-chat 2022-04-27 14:33:02 What is this...
creations-chat 2022-04-27 14:34:57 That "station wagon" is an abomination of a car.
creations-chat 2022-04-27 14:36:43 No shit sherlock
creations-chat 2022-04-27 14:38:30 Low effort? My man that looks like it was made by someone that only just joined plane crazy and thought it would be a great idea to put their creation on a discord server thats highly judgemental.
creations-chat 2022-04-27 14:40:11 Now that says something skill wise
creations-chat 2022-04-27 16:31:14 No clue. Maybe by making a boat with 6000 blocks and then saying "it moov gud"

creations-chat 2022-08-02 08:15:19 Detailed house with no ceiling. How do you keep the rain out?
creations-chat 2022-08-02 08:17:20 Ist called joke Hans.
creations-chat 2022-08-23 14:29:46 <@485015314292015104> on your TBAG TB2 Does the module disconnect from the main craft? Because i have a TB2 where the module disconnects and an elevator car comes out.
creations-chat 2022-08-30 10:59:54 The bot has gone kaput
creations-chat 2022-09-04 08:14:02 Im still gathering images but is there anything i need to work on with this ship?
creations-chat 2022-09-04 08:17:31 What is said piece
creations-chat 2022-09-04 08:19:33 Im perplexed
creations-chat 2022-09-04 08:24:05 Too jagged
creations-chat 2022-09-04 08:26:10 But what is the one piece that needs to be added tho
creations-chat 2022-09-04 08:29:16 Aight
creations-chat 2022-09-04 08:31:24 I looked on the google search list and below one piece it said manga. So no im not going anywhere near that
creations-chat 2022-11-02 08:11:24 <@773913961883369515> may i ask why your enterprise A has a stardrive hull thats rlly out of proportion
creations-chat 2022-11-03 20:36:19 WIP Thunderbird 2 I guess
creations-chat 2022-11-07 20:37:44 Ima post my Thunderbird 2 hopefully
creations-chat 2022-11-07 20:40:04 Thanks my guy
creations-chat 2022-11-08 19:55:13 I know Thunderbirds is a childrens show but honestly the craft are quite interesting.
creations-chat 2022-11-08 20:28:25 The flare outs from the fuselage (the curved bits that join up into the wings) are too flat.
the-dump 2022-11-09 16:37:24 Duo lingo just have a trident missile stored away
the-dump 2022-11-09 16:38:38 
creations-chat 2022-11-10 06:55:14 That just makes me think of Thunderbird 1
creations-chat 2022-11-10 19:25:38 Oof
creations-chat 2022-12-02 08:39:27 Ah yes. Snack = vanguard class SSBN Nuclear warhead carrier.  Yes i would agree.
creations-chat 2022-12-06 08:19:50 <@773913961883369515> does that crossfield and excelsior class have any interior?
creations-chat 2022-12-07 16:01:44 Nice. Could you tell your friend to actually paint the hull.
creations-chat 2022-12-07 17:03:44 The USS Discovery does NOT have a bland white exterior. If your wanting to do the NCC-1031 variant and not the NCC-1031-A variant then the hull is a copper bronzy colour with grey rims on the saucer and blue tinted warp coils, bussard collectors and deflector dish. The refit has a *dark* grey hull with blue tinted bussard collectors, warp coils and deflector dish. But *never* has either of them had a straight white exterior. Tell them to fix it if you want but if they don't it just wont be accurate what so ever.
creations-chat 2022-12-08 07:47:34 Which one. TOS era or refit
creations-chat 2022-12-15 18:14:38 thoughts on this Victory hull? so far
creations-chat 2022-12-15 18:29:21 Im attempting the mustard paint scheme other than the modern day one as it appeals more to me
creations-chat 2022-12-15 18:32:16 personally i dont think so but if you do then ok. I think your thinking of the modern day paint scheme other than the 2015 one
help 2022-12-16 08:40:18 Is that a T-95?
help 2022-12-16 19:02:19 Spectacular. Good luck

creations-chat 2023-03-28 06:49:44 I think the hull looks quite good but it needs decorations like markings or small bits of stowage.
