creations-chat 2022-04-17 13:23:03 it looks great, maybe try making the propeller look a bit more... normal? Idk how to describe it..
help 2022-04-21 00:48:06 Is this the place to ask for help building?
help 2022-04-21 00:49:49 Because my brain may have melted in building a B-17 with 5x5 width and height of the fuselage with slabs, and can’t seem to make the cockpit look normal
help 2022-04-21 00:53:11 Actually i kinda know how, i just suck at making my helicopter hover well
help 2022-04-21 00:55:07 No the emergency re take off runway is too much to the right

bot-central 2022-05-29 01:33:52 ?rhelp
creations-chat 2022-05-29 07:13:51 i now have to try making this
the-dump 2022-06-19 12:14:07 
the-dump 2022-06-19 12:14:15 And that’s how i became an idiot
the-dump 2022-06-19 13:00:40 Im Asian so that’s technically true for me as well
creations-chat 2022-09-07 14:07:14 i got addicted to war thunder so i haven't built a plane in months, ima go make a F2A-1 Buffalo
bug-reports 2022-10-02 15:01:13 i've found a bug that when you first use a paint tool on a sign you can select the text inside and change it to what ever, im not sure if other people can see this though
bug-reports 2022-10-02 15:02:49 forgot to mention inside top text, as you can see, filter does not work
bug-reports 2022-10-02 15:04:15 oh yeah, that's actually really smart
bug-reports 2022-10-02 15:06:01 ah yes, updates
bug-reports 2022-10-02 15:06:39 i don't even know if they're suppose to be helping the game or breaking them now
bug-reports 2022-10-02 15:07:07 i mean... yeah
bug-reports 2022-10-02 15:07:45 more like sphagette
bug-reports 2022-10-02 15:08:30 anyways, when will it exist?
bug-reports 2022-10-02 15:09:22 i mean.. you aren't wrong
bug-reports 2022-10-02 15:10:03 makes sense
bug-reports 2022-10-02 15:11:00 true
bug-reports 2022-10-02 15:13:16 actually- it's more like a new update
bug-reports 2022-10-02 15:13:22 but as a new game
bug-reports 2022-10-02 15:14:39 yeah, that's more true
bug-reports 2022-10-02 15:17:15 isn't that an optional setting for newer models are am i just da stupid
bug-reports 2022-10-02 15:19:20 oh schiebe, that's a good question
bug-reports 2022-10-02 15:20:33 tbh
bug-reports 2022-10-02 15:20:46 i think Aim 9 fits better
bug-reports 2022-10-02 15:22:12 since i don't think that they will have the missile be able to be launched at sea level and go all the way to space and hit a fast jet because Phoenix got stupid tracking range(this is exaggerated, they don't have this much range)
bug-reports 2022-10-02 15:23:14 also if this is just a rewrite, i think the missiles will keep the close range tracking
bug-reports 2023-05-06 07:21:25 Great for when you want to make a B-17 with actual correct numbers of guns
