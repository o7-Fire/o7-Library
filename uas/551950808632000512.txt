help 2020-10-16 21:01:08 does anyone know how to make pistons that dont shake immensely when under weight? I have a tanker truck that can disconnect the cab from the tank and re connect but the pistons that hold up the tank make the tank wobble alot

help 2020-10-16 21:03:49 hm
help 2020-10-16 21:03:50 okay

help 2020-10-19 21:00:28 anyone have any tips to make a hover drive plane (or any 550+ speed plane) more stable WITHOUT a use of changing to a conveyor drive or something?
help 2020-10-19 21:02:51 less control surfaces?
help 2020-10-19 21:03:23 oh

help 2020-10-27 18:23:09 does anyone have any tips of how to make a simple heli rotor that doesnt have 2 stacked on top of eachother (if that makes sense)
help 2020-11-13 04:35:47 anyone know how to make fast, well handling, engines that are throttlable (not conveyor drives, those are practically on/off)that dont lag you? for some reason hover drives lag me.
help 2020-11-19 18:41:12 i have a question, i have a heli rotor because im making a rotodyne, its just propeller blades with rocket engines on the tips, but the plane goes up and tilts left

help 2020-12-23 06:04:12 its hard to make it without motor lock
help 2020-12-23 06:04:18 i made mine without motor lock though
help 2020-12-23 06:04:26 i put it under the wing
help 2020-12-23 06:05:28 you dont need to
help 2020-12-23 06:05:35 it just makes it easier if you know
help 2020-12-23 06:05:45 i didnt use motor lock even though i know how

help 2020-12-23 06:08:10 yeah
help 2020-12-23 06:08:15 its way easier with motor lock
help 2020-12-23 06:08:21 and it helps with other builds also
help 2020-12-23 06:08:36 i wouldve done motor lock if the plane wasnt for a challenge
help 2020-12-23 06:09:14 it was stressful without motor lock
help 2020-12-23 06:10:53 motor lock is pretty simple also
help 2020-12-23 06:14:59 uh

help 2020-12-23 06:18:03 you can put a motor inside of a wedge
help 2020-12-23 06:18:08 and stuff like that
help 2020-12-23 06:18:22 thats like one minor thing
help 2020-12-23 06:18:50 you can make a hidden motor so it looks better
help 2020-12-23 06:18:54 I
help 2020-12-23 06:18:58 i cant explain

help 2020-12-23 06:24:49 i dont even know what im sending at this point either
help 2020-12-23 06:26:06 whatever is connected to the base of the motor will come with it when its locked
help 2020-12-23 06:26:20 if thats what youre asking
help 2020-12-23 06:27:58 i think you might just need time to look over this
help 2020-12-23 06:28:48 hm
help 2020-12-23 06:28:56 yeah maybe that
help 2020-12-23 06:29:13 its also just a little confusing at first
help 2020-12-23 06:32:13 i only use minor motor lock, find someone whos actually good at it
help 2020-12-23 06:34:58 it is basic and minor motorlock
help 2020-12-23 06:35:13 yeah you seem like a guy who knows his motors

creations-chat 2020-12-23 06:50:28 if its not expert its not good is what ive been seeing in pcc
creations-chat 2020-12-23 06:52:29 a non-creation was just posted and deleted, right?
creations-chat 2020-12-23 06:54:36 it depends if the tutorial is well known or not
creations-chat 2020-12-23 07:01:14 the way to stop this is to either take a picture with less of the titanic so its mainly their actual build or to point out the build
creations-chat 2020-12-23 07:07:44 "I don't even know (titanic @Deadly_Pr0YT (sorry for pinging you again)) My build is the tiny one on the right." would work <@!485229989537644547> change the 0 to an O so it actually pings them if you want it to
creations-chat 2020-12-23 07:09:45 alright well it seems this whole, blob of messages is sorted
creations-chat 2020-12-23 07:11:46 voice typing? maybe they have some type of screen that can make braille from like 2043
