creations-chat 2021-09-27 01:12:51 Togs irl have have covered tracks like that the turret is accurate and itâ€™s dimensions are aswell Iâ€™d say the only problem with it is the barrel I know that already but Iâ€™m just too lazy to do somthing about it the togs gun isnâ€™t black either if u donâ€™t like it u prolly just donâ€™t like togs
creations-chat 2021-09-27 01:25:18 yeah the ppl in this server kinda suck... from what i see its a server full of ppl who build flawless builds and see everything else but their builds as trash
creations-chat 2021-09-29 16:17:18 Can I get some help idk what to do!, Iâ€™m trying to build a A6 Jug and the suspension glitches out sometimes to a lot when I drive make a turn or hit a terrain too hard. It glitches like as if someone hit you with that piston glitch, it has the classic tank controls the 2 motors with a spring on it for suspension the wheels are 4 blocks thick and 7 long 7 tall and itâ€™s accurate size so itâ€™s large at 3200+ blocks how to fix?!?

creations-chat 2021-10-21 16:38:26 I love and hate it at the same time 

I like that itâ€™s the ship but I donâ€™t like the custom colors I prefer if it was just the original now that I saw starllords ship I think ima build one when I get home but a gryo version because the way it flys in the movie would be epic for gryo
