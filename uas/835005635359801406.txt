creations-chat 2023-03-16 15:32:32 but i agree some whitenames are shit but so arrogant and blame us because we downvote builds that does not meet our building standards (they think 2 hours build is big effort)
creations-chat 2023-03-16 15:35:22 designer 2's sometimes are worst than whitenames (not majority of them)
creations-chat 2023-03-16 15:50:21 no
creations-chat 2023-03-16 15:52:31 Because it is you simply build something and its good for you, but not for us then you start to go everywhere and complain, and how is that elitism? You simply not good enough to get upvotes from us then give 399 reasons why we are harsh on you and call building standards in a building game "elitism". This truly is whitename activity and this is why we hate unranked.
creations-chat 2023-03-16 15:57:56 That isn't elitism. In fact, pcc's building standards to date is the worst I had ever seen in my time here. Still, there're so many newbies and possibly undes blaming us for having down opinions. You just need above average nowadays to get upvotes and expert roles and you still call this elitism. It's not like you need to be the best or whatever it is to get good score. Just play the game, get better and stop complaining about us voting.
creations-chat 2023-03-16 16:01:47 That's the only way for the community to get better for me. <@777623164237905962> The whitename stereotype exist because some people with white colored name do some activities that make us get brain damage beyond repair like creating dumb argues, mad at us for downvoting, being so dumb and braincell-devouring like <@903302246979223572> and stuffs, posting shits on reddit about us being harsh in <#384025409945337856> for downvoting them and shits.
creations-chat 2023-03-16 16:03:56 Prime example of whitename activity:
creations-chat 2023-03-16 16:06:36 grass go brrrr
creations-chat 2023-03-16 16:08:39 yessir i live in Asia no snow <:nooo:787097964946259978>
creations-chat 2023-03-16 16:12:25 Yes sadly that it will get harder because some "experts" can't accept the fact that there's a small amount of unranked people with whitename that actually want to learn the game and they are actually chill.

creations-chat 2023-03-16 16:48:04 because the bot is dead rn
creations-chat 2023-03-16 16:51:12 Upvote/Downvote is literally a way for people to show opinions on your builds whether they like it or they do not like it. Thats how it works. They exist for a reason and you guys want it to not be used like what the heck? Downvoting is a way to give constructive feedbacks fast and instant and you want them to spend their time, fixing small stuffs just to be given some bs by some stubborn people. Again, they exist for a reason and stop complaining about people using it like intended.
creations-chat 2023-03-16 16:54:39 We do need them to show our opinion on people's builds without spending too much time on it. It's just some people can not accept the fact that it exists and it's important in this. Also can not accept the facts that upvotes and downvotes are normal in a creation posting channel of a building game. You probably think downvoting is like doing a mass protest saying how bad you are but it just a fast way to show someone's thoughts on your creation.
creations-chat 2023-03-16 16:59:10 I don't need to spend my precious time doing meaningless things. I'd rather dipping myself in homeworks than spending my time with someone don't have a functioning brain.
creations-chat 2023-03-16 17:02:07 For us, that's the best method. If you feel like constructive downvotes harrass you so bad or assault your mental health and sensitive enough to feel like they are needles stabbing your organs then just post them here and see **real criticism of pcc** that sometimes so damn toxic that can burn your ego.
creations-chat 2023-03-16 17:06:07 You didn't even read and say we are "goofheads" like wth 💀 before you think why we created the whitename stereotype think about what majority of the unranked does.

creations-chat 2023-05-04 00:58:25 your build is shit then you complain about downvotes and saying if a build isn't perfect it gets downvoted to hell but when i point out your flaws you will just answer with that you fucking shit brain
creations-chat 2023-05-04 01:01:50 its shit
creations-chat 2023-05-04 01:04:47 most large build upvotes are done by whitenames
creations-chat 2023-05-04 01:07:13 what issues also switch to <#384021699466756107> since shit slowmode
creations-chat 2023-05-04 01:10:54 technically its complaining you even blame the community for not upvoting your shit

creations-chat 2023-05-04 02:40:20 Then why do you say the community is shit when you make something that we don't like with our standards? Fuckwhit <@636445104118431746> you're a whitename who thinks all builds are supposed to get upvotes from a server that has high building standards. Fuck your stupidity and go back to your kindergarten filled with snowflakes.
creations-chat 2023-05-04 02:42:24 How is downvoting unreasonable? We don't like the build so we do it. Besides the community is good when you stop being someone that feels assaulted because of a word. No one found the community shit but only you that can't take downvotes and whitenames
creations-chat 2023-05-04 02:44:27 Besides most of the time i give proper feedbacks some will just ignore it saying they don't care therefore I don't want to waste my braincells. You did say the community is shit and I have business in it
creations-chat 2023-05-04 02:47:22 You want proper feedbacks? Bad interior, too bland with bad coloring. Bad paintjob. Disproportionate. Bad windshield with no frame. Weird nose. Blame them not me <@538169956735647745>
creations-chat 2023-05-04 02:50:18 The nose should be higher and it should be curved more and it should be shorter. Windshield needs to be 0.5 blocks taller and with frame
creations-chat 2023-05-04 02:52:29 finally someone takes actual feedbacks and not saying they dont care and wont fix like majority of whitenames you wanna know why server went toxic? No brain whitenames asking for feedbacks then straight up harrass us
creations-chat 2023-05-04 02:56:38 they are the one made the community shit (dont say shit about the community in front of experts worse way to ask for feedbacks and best way to start arguement)
creations-chat 2023-05-04 02:58:47 its not that high i got votes that shit my ass with a shitty f18e (e varient such a cute borzoi that can brrrrrrt ❤️)
