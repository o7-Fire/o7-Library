creations-chat 2022-05-09 03:13:19 Does anyone know how to make windshield lines on your planes or a tutorial to learn I want to build a c 130 it would look great
creations-chat 2022-05-09 03:15:32 One question, how do you lower the trails using motorlock to make windshields? They make incredible creations with these systems, but they are complicated. Do you know any tutorials to learn how to do these things?

creations-chat 2023-04-23 03:09:04 Could these planes carry weapons?
creations-chat 2023-04-23 03:41:58 It's a T 33 I think Cuba used it in combat and sank 2 ships this is mexican
creations-chat 2023-04-23 03:47:14 Although they only carried M2 cannons and had two hardpoints which I assume are the ones on the wings that carry the fuel tanks, although they did it with only their cannons... That's why I was wondering if they could carry more
creations-chat 2023-04-23 03:56:45 Why don't you try using vector thrust?
