creations-chat 2021-02-02 01:56:29 I'm currently building Italian Battleship Roma at the moment. Is there any comments on the way I build my hulls?
creations-chat 2021-02-03 10:38:54 I'm quitting on Roma
creations-chat 2021-02-05 03:52:49 What do you think of my WIP Andrea Doria? Do I need any changes? DO I need to add something?
(I usually paint my creations gray so I can further see the blocks clearly, or maybe it's my style of building to simulate metal or primer to the ship)
creations-chat 2021-02-05 05:08:25 I'll be doing that later
creations-chat 2021-02-06 05:56:25 Andrea Doria is almost Complete... Any comments?
creations-chat 2021-02-06 07:21:22 Yes, and I'll add it soon. More details will be added first before the coloring
creations-chat 2021-02-08 03:53:03 Really... a Bismarck with gigantic turrets...
creations-chat 2021-02-09 08:44:18 I've stopped working on Andrea Doria for a while, but she's 95% complete with the paint job and all. I'll be building a Sloop of War for the Contest. Is there any suggestions on this build which I can improve or add?
creations-chat 2021-02-09 08:46:29 yes
creations-chat 2021-02-09 08:50:41 Let's say its custom-made...
creations-chat 2021-02-09 08:53:51 okay. I'm in the process of shortening the vessel. I'll take your word.
creations-chat 2021-02-09 08:59:07 I see.
creations-chat 2021-02-09 09:04:58 ah, I see. To give a little update, I've already shortened the vessel, and now its starting to appropriately look like a Sloop of War.
creations-chat 2021-02-09 09:23:09 Update:
The Vessel is now shorter to appropriately have the appearance of a Sloop of War
creations-chat 2021-02-09 12:09:20 UPDATE:
My Sloop of War now has a name: HMS Black Rose.
It now has masts, but the yards and sails will have to be added. Also the remaining details of my ship will be aded on the following day. Shall I add rigging? Are there any suggestions? If so, add them below.
creations-chat 2021-02-09 13:48:12 Update on my Sloop of War, HMS Black Rose
The Ship now has a stern lifeboat. Rigging and sails will be added. The rest of the ship will be finished tomorrow.
creations-chat 2021-02-10 02:49:45 She's 60% complete... Any comments?
creations-chat 2021-02-10 03:06:52 Ok.
The sails are gonna be added...
creations-chat 2021-02-10 03:11:27 Not yet... I gotta be as thin as possible.
creations-chat 2021-02-10 03:18:45 Shall I change the shape of the sails?
creations-chat 2021-02-10 03:20:51 I'll color the ship and the sails once the entire build is finished. I treat them like those Model Kits that I like to assemble and paint.
creations-chat 2021-02-10 05:20:26 Ohh yeah... HMS Black Rose is coming together... Shall I add more sails and rigging?
creations-chat 2021-02-10 05:25:55 thanks
creations-chat 2021-02-10 08:23:39 This is a huge problem... My sailing ship keeps tipping to the left or right whenever I spawn and fold it on water... are there any ways I can fix this?
creations-chat 2021-02-10 08:25:40 okay
creations-chat 2021-02-10 08:38:05 Problem solved... I used <@!660019099430289418> 's advice...
creations-chat 2021-02-11 03:58:48 Any comments so far on my Sloop of War? Any changes?
creations-chat 2021-02-11 04:00:51 more rigging? or the masts themselves?
creations-chat 2021-02-14 07:34:46 Lookin' good. I was supposed to make one... and I think I'll make the Sikorsky Ilya Muromets or the Vickers Vimy.
creations-chat 2021-02-17 12:33:06 It's a little too stretched for a 170V, but least you tried...
creations-chat 2021-02-18 07:39:42 Attempted to recreate HMS Belfast's turret. Also, it's another WIP... and I dunno if I should finish Andrea Doria or not...
creations-chat 2021-02-18 09:25:54 Aye
creations-chat 2021-02-27 04:49:44 Skill and Experience...
creations-chat 2021-02-27 13:04:00 Attempted to reconstruct Z-23's Forward turret. I'll be planning on making the entire destroyer, but due to limitations on some parts, the barrels of the guns looked ugly. I'll manage those limitations on the final build of the Warship.

   Inside the turrets are Rocket Launchers to portray the shells of the Destroyer. I will also use rockets to portray the ship's torpedoes. But limitations should be met on the final build of the German Destroyer.

   If there are any comments on the creation, you can put them down to further improve the appearance of the ship's turret.

creations-chat 2021-03-07 16:32:50 <@!773287769488752653> Actually the BV-38 is a *Fictional Design* for *Raiders of the Lost Ark*. Also, BV stands for **Blohm und Voss**, an aircraft/ship company. No evidence of the BV-38's blueprints exist. Only made up from the idea of one Steven Spielberg.

Still it's a nice build, but you better research the plane of there are any actual blueprints made by Blohm und Voss.
creations-chat 2021-03-08 00:18:59 Should have noticed that...
creations-chat 2021-03-18 12:54:08 Work in Progress on an Austro-Hungarian Dreadnought. It's the*** SMS Szent Istvan***. I'll even try to recreate the image of the ship sinking once completed.

I used a 3d model of her sister ship, *Viribus Unitis* from *Sketchfab* as the reference. Taking a break from WWII and Early cold war era ships... It's time for Dreadnoughts.
creations-chat 2021-03-18 12:58:29 thanks for the feedback.
creations-chat 2021-03-20 05:22:37 My Szent Istvan is 90% complete! Now I need to add the colors and the ship's rigging...
creations-chat 2021-03-21 02:26:42 That's called an HVSS <@!695783576549195936>

Can be seen on Shermans and some WWII American tanks

creations-chat 2021-03-27 02:20:15 A WIP on *Scharnhorst*. It;s basically a *remake *of my old one which looked TERRIBLE in my opinion bc of the hull structure. I might get the title of Shipwright if I finish this vessel. If there are any comments that will help improve this ship, put 'em down so I can improve the vessel.
creations-chat 2021-03-27 02:41:26 ok
creations-chat 2021-03-27 02:45:24 Another angle of the WIP Scharnhorst
creations-chat 2021-03-27 02:47:54 I'll see what I can do on the weathering process...
creations-chat 2021-03-27 05:38:15 Will do, if the entire ship is complete
creations-chat 2021-03-27 05:40:58 Mogus.exe has stopped working
creations-chat 2021-03-30 08:23:00 A little sneak peek of my finished Scharnhorst...
It's in its 1942 Channel Dash paint scheme
creations-chat 2021-03-30 12:13:37 I haven't the time to find or create the right shade of blue...
creations-chat 2021-03-30 12:52:48 Okay...
creations-chat 2021-03-30 12:56:37 Also, I tried to match the shade of blue in the image below...
creations-chat 2021-03-30 13:15:13 Got it, boss
creations-chat 2021-03-30 15:19:43 I'll take note
creations-chat 2021-04-02 08:19:16 A Work in Progress on a Folding rifle I'm currently making. It's an ***M1 Carbine*** with a ***Folding Stock *** used for Paratroopers.
creations-chat 2021-04-02 08:24:49 Here's the reference of my next project
creations-chat 2021-04-20 13:36:22 Hey guys! I haven't been active in a long while due to my College classes and heavy amounts of boredom. 

I'll just leave this WIP of my latest project, the ***USS Wichita***. 

I have completed the ship's bow section, and now I'll have to finish the mid and stern section of the one of a kind American Cruiser which became the basis for the *Baltimore*. If you have any comments about this bow build, you may put them down. The ship will be colored once the entire structure has been finished. I wanted to treat my build style as if I'm building a Plastic Model. 

If you're asking about that Wichita Model I use for reference, its from Sketchfab.Com. There are World of Warships models if you wanna use 'em for reference.
creations-chat 2021-04-20 14:10:07 Secrets...
creations-chat 2021-04-21 10:26:21 The Mid section of ***USS Wichita*** is almost complete. The bridge and the funnels are almost complete. What is missing are the rangefinders and radar systems above the bridge.
creations-chat 2021-04-28 01:36:07 Lets say its like a gigantic "Chain" of some sort....
creations-chat 2021-04-28 04:13:01 My next train project ever since the 20th Century Limited. This time its the legendary **Henschel-Wegmann Zug** of the *Deutsche Reichsbahn Gesselschaft*. Right now, I am finishing up the touches of the lead locomotive, and then work for the passenger coaches will start afterwards. 

The Locomotive presented before you is the *DRG Class 61 001*. I tried my best into replicating the locomotive in player scale form. 

If there are any comments you wanted to give out so I can make changes on the Train, drop them down if you want to.
creations-chat 2021-05-16 03:18:48 Any thoughts of my **VK 100.01 Mammut**? 

I tried mimicking the color schemes of some tanks that were rushed out of the factory in 1945 like this E-100 that you see on the right. I tried matching the colors on the tank's turret and suspension bars. Any suggestions to further match the colors?
creations-chat 2021-07-23 12:19:02 Yes, My Gepard really is inaccurate bc of some limitations.
creations-chat 2021-07-23 12:41:13 Is it supposed to be a **Panther** or a **Königstiger**, or a mashup of both?
creations-chat 2021-07-23 12:43:24 Nice attempt, anyway. You can do better. It nearly reminded me of the King Tiger because of that camo.
creations-chat 2021-07-23 12:45:50 Yeah, hehe. And the positioning of the wheels also made me remind of the King Tiger too.
creations-chat 2021-07-27 14:54:48 I based this photo manipulation from this screenshot from Metal Gear Solid V

creations-chat 2021-07-27 15:52:46 Oh poop. Just realized that the T-72 was *never used* in the *Soviet-Afghan War*... 
but I just wanna put it in to reference **Metal Gear Solid V** and their fictional TT77 Tank
creations-chat 2021-07-27 15:56:16 Oh bugger me... but I decided to add it in as a reference to **Metal Gear Solid V**, since it takes place in Afghanistan in 1984, and had tanks resembling a T-72 (TT77 Nosorog).
creations-chat 2021-07-27 16:41:19 Agreed. Only the **US Navy** operated the Skyhawk. Not in both branches at the same time.
creations-chat 2021-07-27 16:48:29 Oh, okay.
But it resembled the Navy Livery
creations-chat 2021-07-28 01:22:43 Tested it in PVP mode
creations-chat 2021-07-28 01:31:28 The Survivability Rate is calculated with how many minutes this thing has survived. 

30 Seconds - 10% 
1 Minute - 15%
1.5 Minutes - 20%
2 Minutes - 25% 
2.5 Minutes - 30% 
3 Minutes - 35% 
3.5 Minutes - 40% 
4 Minutes - 45% 
4.5 Minutes - 50%
5 Minutes - 55%
5.5 Minutes - 60%
6 Minutes - 65% 
6.5 Minutes - 70%
7 Minutes - 75% 
7.5 Minutes - 80%
8 Minutes - 85%
8.5 Minutes - 90%
9 Minutes - 95%
9.5 + Minutes - 100%

Reason why my T-72 is at 40% is because there's Shredder Bugs, Rockets, Aircraft, and stupidly OP creations, making the vehicle almost impossible to survive.
creations-chat 2021-07-28 01:33:31 If I were to build Aircraft, then the survivability rate increases.
If Ships, then its as low as tanks or ground vehicles bc of Shredders, planes, and OP builds.
creations-chat 2021-07-28 01:36:14 Hmm... maybe I should use that as a new form of calculation. Or maybe add a "Kill Rate" on my creation. or at least try an damage any enemy vehicle in PVP Mode.
creations-chat 2021-07-28 01:39:19 Hmm... I'll be damned... Maybe I'll put TNT Armor on my Warships to accurately portray how strong they were. After all, Deck Armor is weak. The Belt Armor and Turret Armor will be invincible. Also the Bridge and Conning Tower as well...

With that, I can survive any Naval Battle in PVP mode.
creations-chat 2021-07-28 01:41:25 Yeah, like irl. But WWI Dreadnoughts have "Torpedo Nets" to prevent them from hitting the ship.
creations-chat 2021-07-28 01:46:22 Okay. But I wanna accurately portray Ship's Speed. And the whole Armor Thing can be managed.
creations-chat 2021-07-28 01:48:45 Yeah Indeed. Manually Detonated and Controlled Torps (if those things are possible to build) are a big problem in Naval Warfare. Especially **Dive Bombing tactics** and **Kamikaze Attacks**. And if possible, if the enemy ship has a **Battering Ram**, then I'll prepare for the worst.
creations-chat 2021-07-28 01:51:45 But AA Defenses are required for a Warship. Especially **American Vessels**, since they are **LOADED** of them. 
I'm more of a **European Warship builder**, and they have less AA so thats a big problem when it comes to aircraft like that.
creations-chat 2021-07-28 01:54:58 Problem is that there are only 10x Guns in the game. I'll have to use everything wisely in the most convenient way possible. Also, there's a limitation of armament in the game. And most ships of WWII follow the **Naval Treaties of Washington and London**, which restricts the gross tonnage and armaments on any warship to be designed. Also, it is even cost effective.
creations-chat 2021-07-28 01:57:54 The **Admiral Graf Spee** of Germany is what I will build. Yes it will have Working AA Guns, and yes it will have TNT belt armor. Also, my third Graf Spee to ever be built.

creations-chat 2021-08-10 13:29:46 Love your wip on your King Tiger. Can't wait to see the finished product!
creations-chat 2021-08-11 07:01:19 Thoughts on my WIP AAT from Star Wars? I'll paint it once the build is complete.
Of course its shit, and you gonna roast it
creations-chat 2021-08-11 09:18:01 Update on my AAT. I tried making it hover like in Ep 1 and The Clone Wars, but keeps on tipping over due to the complex designs of the machine itself.
creations-chat 2021-08-11 09:24:02 ok I think I made up a solution but thanks for the advice
creations-chat 2021-08-11 09:30:11 she almost done

creations-chat 2021-08-11 10:55:27 Add Diamond Plate texture to the tracks to make it more unique, as if to capture the texture of the tracks.

creations-chat 2021-08-12 02:17:56 Hmm, the original looked better, since the Firetruck needs Sirens. I'm confused what to choose from the two. Still **Excellent Work, bud.**
creations-chat 2021-08-12 10:28:06 Doesn't look like U-96.
This is U-96.
creations-chat 2021-08-12 10:30:14 Honestly though, you made a hybrid U-Boat between a Type XXIII and a Type VII C.
creations-chat 2021-08-12 14:28:10 Very strange to see a KV-2 in a Black and grey Paint Scheme... would have been best if it was painted in Russian Green, or Pravda White.

creations-chat 2021-08-19 13:23:22 I improved my Tu-95 with a revamped fuselage, and some angle locked wings. I need to fill in the gaps and finish the plane with more folding and motorlocks.
creations-chat 2021-08-19 13:44:24 I know it supposed to be two,
creations-chat 2021-08-21 02:52:09 How can you call that a "Panther Tank".

creations-chat 2021-08-24 14:33:28 Or maybe its because they censored his first name because of... a certain form of media that is forbidden... Now I know why.

creations-chat 2021-09-02 12:05:18 If I was him, I'd have the engines stick the the fuselage with Cameras so thatit wouldnt be noticeable.
creations-chat 2021-09-02 12:31:15 I suggest you to set the text size to 1 to hide the "Configure to Edit" on the sides of your plane. Or simply just add a "-" to make it completely "invisible". I did that to some of my creations.
creations-chat 2021-09-02 12:34:34 I don't see any SAAB Drakens with that paint scheme. Is it Custom? If yes, continue it.

creations-chat 2021-09-04 13:16:24 "Offending?" OFFENDING!? BRUH!
The Slave 1 is the REAL NAME of Boba Fett's Spaceship. You're just an SJW like those fuckers at Disney who murdered Star Wars. Also. Slavery is a theme in Star Wars. Anakin Skywalker was a Slave to Watto, and Leia became a Slave to Jabba the Hutt. You sir, are also ruining the true spirit of Star Wars. The ship is named "Slave 1", and will forever will be called that.
creations-chat 2021-09-04 13:18:31 BUT THAT IS THE TUMBLER. 
BrUh! Just use the actual name of the vehicle you made.

Challenger I
creations-chat 2021-09-14 15:05:00 Challenger 1 - Gulf War
Challenger 2 - Iraq War 

Basically Challenger 1 and Challenger 2 fought Saddam in different decades, still going to Challenger 1
creations-chat 2021-09-14 15:13:07 Oh, but did the Challenger 2 make the world's longest tank-on-tank kill? No it didn't. It is credited to the Challenger 1 back in 1991 in Operation Desert Storm. The tank destroyed an unknown Iraqi tank (possibly a T-72) in the range of three miles on 26 February 1991.
creations-chat 2021-09-14 15:15:12 indeed. and South Africa still uses it as the Olifant.

creations-chat 2021-09-17 09:16:18 First of all, the Kriegsmarine was renamed into the DEUTSCHE MARINE or BUNDESMARINE in post-WWII Germany. There was also the Nationale Volksmarine in the DDR. since Germany was divided into two countries after WWII, there are two German Navies - the NATIONALE VOLKSMARINE (DDR) and the DEUTSCHE MARINE/BUNDESMARINE (BRD)
creations-chat 2021-09-17 09:20:10 Arleigh Burke Destroyer + German Flag = German Ship
Iowa-Class Battleship + Malaysian Flag = Malaysian Ship
Bismarck-Class Battleship + Indonesian Flag = Indonesian Ship
---
This is why I don't like some players in Plane Crazy, just adding their national flag on the wrong ships/vehicles. This is why Historical Accuracy is needed for the game. At least the Soviet Union received the Nurnberg and renamed it to Admiral Makarov after WWII, and Germany received some M47 Pattons postwar to build up the Bundeswehr.
creations-chat 2021-09-17 09:28:13 Historical Accuracy examples: 
Tanks
T-34 - Poland (Export/Lend Lease), Soviet Union, Germany (Captured)
Leopard 1 - Brazil (Export), West Germany, Italy (Export)
M4 Sherman - USA, Soviet Union (Lend-Lease), United Kingdom (Derivatives)

Warships
U-Boats - Germany, USA (U-505, Captured), United Kingdom (HMS Graph)
Conte di Cavour-Class Battleship - Italy, Soviet Union (Handed over as Arkhangelsk)
Prinz Eugen - Germany, USA (Captured and renamed as USS Prinz Eugen)

Aircraft 
F-4 Phantom - USA, UK (Export/License built), West Germany (Export)
Aerospatiale Alouette - Austria (Export), France, Turkey (Export)
Mikoyan MiG-29 - Soviet Union, West Germany (Handed over from the DDR), Czechoslovakia

This is why Historical Accuracy is important.

creations-chat 2021-09-27 10:13:27 perhaps try to brighten up the colors a bit so it won't look like an unlit cigar. make it more orange in appearance. 
Try grabbing the colors from this picture that I found online.
creations-chat 2021-09-27 10:15:35 to me, their choice of coloring made it look like a Cigar. 
You wouldn't want a cigar to act as the fuel tank of your Space Shuttle. Also, Cigars burn out.

creations-chat 2021-09-29 09:46:35 It is. But he even told me that "Challenger 2 Better", until I told him that the Challenger 1 is more historic and valuable because it had made a Record Breaking Kill on Operation Desert Storm. I even made this just to show that the Challenger 1 is a record holder. Also, I felt that he was taunting me because I couldnt make tanks that have tracks. I never built any tanks with fully functioning treads in my life, only fake treads.

<@!760578875163410432> I understand.
creations-chat 2021-10-05 02:51:35 Why not try an online color picker. That will be easy. Someone give him a link to that website.
creations-chat 2021-10-05 04:58:17 ok here ya go
creations-chat 2021-10-05 05:00:33 Shall I use this as color reference for my Cruella De Vil car?
creations-chat 2021-10-05 05:04:02 im trying to give the impression that the Mercedes is owned by Cruella.
so Red (or white as seen in the live action movies) and black would be the preferred choice.
creations-chat 2021-10-05 05:06:13 hehe lol I am
creations-chat 2021-10-05 05:25:02 Thoughts of the paint scheme? I tried to match the paint scheme of Cruella's car from the 1961 film.
creations-chat 2021-10-05 05:29:16 The little string is the Horn. Also, there's two versions of Cruella's car.
LEFT - 101 Dalmatians (1961)
RIGHT - 101 Dalmatians (1996), 102 Dalmatians (2000)

I dunno which color scheme to choose from... either the left one or the right one... 
and the Mercedes-Benz 540k does not have horns like that. Only applicable to vehicles from the 1910's. Cruella's Car and the 540k are 1930's vehicles.
creations-chat 2021-10-05 13:23:31

creations-chat 2021-10-07 14:09:51 same, like the time that mod (Purifiedwater14) plastered that Challenger 2 in front of my face when I was building my Challenger 1. I viewed it as a mock. Also, he legit said "Challenger 2 better" which I viewed it, in my opinion, "offensive" or "shameful". Worst part is, he downvoted it. 
I guess that's like a "mockery" he did.
creations-chat 2021-10-07 14:12:13 now that is beautiful. Keep building to further improve your builds. The more you build, the more improvements you make. 
Thanks <@!723940197456281640>.
creations-chat 2021-10-07 14:15:30 that I don't know.
creations-chat 2021-10-07 14:18:01 Yes. Challenger 2 **Hotter.** Challenger 1 - **more important**.
bc That is the **tank [Challenger 1]** that scored the **world's longest tank kill** back in **1991 **during **Operation Desert Storm**.
One good reason why **Challenger 1 **is **MORE IMPORTANT** than Challenger 2.
creations-chat 2021-10-07 14:20:14 this was my attempt at making a Blackhawk. Looks terrible. I might as well remake this or keep on practicing until I become pro at helis.

Also, this was built in 2020.
creations-chat 2021-10-07 14:23:29 I understand. but still he downvoted it, which made me feel that I was "mocked". 
Here's evidence.
creations-chat 2021-10-07 14:31:12 something I'd see in War Thunder... One tank, three helis/aircraft.
creations-chat 2021-10-07 14:34:54 well I did build an SPAAG (**Flakpanzer Gepard**), and i dunno if it did get kills or not.

creations-chat 2021-10-11 15:15:44 Tu-4 is basically a B-29 Superfortress.
creations-chat 2021-10-11 15:18:24 I UNDERSTAND. I know. But what if one plans to make the TU-4, then they'll just copy Mad Vulpen's build and plaster the RED STAR on the tails, wings, and fuselage of the fucking plane. I'm adding another Tupolev plane that is really easy to build and get away with. 
Many tutorial builders can easily get away with Vulpen's B-29 and plater on some Soviet Stars and call it a TU-4. Therefore, the TU-4 is still a B-29.

creations-chat 2021-10-13 15:34:27 Have the back of the wings be a little more less angled. and add a curve at the tips of the wings. You wouldn't want your He 111's wings too like that of a Ju 52's.
creations-chat 2021-10-13 16:20:28 Just about right. Now add the curves on the tips of the wings.

creations-chat 2021-10-14 05:06:49 This looks hella clean. Now add the wings with all the weapons on the sode of the chopper. And add the landing gear to make it a complete hind. I understand about the sacrifice on the rotors, so thats okay. Finish it. I can't wait to see the final product!
creations-chat 2021-10-14 11:20:05 Exactly. Looked like a Gamecube/PS2 Model.

creations-chat 2021-10-30 17:29:19 <@!420713956231872521> Your **USS Lexington (CC-1)** is utter dogshit. You have harassed a *Battlecruiser that never was*. I have only one word to say to you: **COPE**.
creations-chat 2021-10-30 17:35:55 I don't know if he's new or not. and if the player is new to the game, then he better learn from the experts and this constructive criticism to improve his build. 

Also. If you looked up the **history of the Lexington-Class Aircraft Carrier**. It's true that the Lexington was **supposed to be a Battlecruiser for the US Navy**. But due to restrictions imposed on the **Naval Treaties after World War I**, the Battlecruiser was converted into an **Aircraft Carrier**. Two carriers were built (Lexington and Saratoga).
creations-chat 2021-10-30 17:39:02 I should have gone easy on him... My biggest mistake. I was being a "perfectionist" when I wrote that essay.
creations-chat 2021-10-30 17:42:20 lol that will be considered "cheating". It should be you who will be doing it. Try reading some Essays so you can be inspired when making one.
creations-chat 2021-10-30 18:36:43 I know the current situation of Roblox. The Lexington Battlecruiser was never built (but converted into an Aircraft Carrier), so only images of models, paintings, or blueprints of the Battlecruiser are available online. Also, I thought he built it days/months BEFORE the Roblox Server Shutdown.
Below you is the blueprints for the never were Lexington-Class Battlecruisers (one of the designs)
creations-chat 2021-10-30 18:41:16 Yes. Also some of the sources are of low image quality. There's even 3d models of the Lexington in 3d Warehouse. One has the several funnels design variation with the other being the final design based on the image that I uploaded.

creations-chat 2021-11-06 13:59:48 overall, your T-90 doesnt look like one. This is (almost) a T-90 (image below).

If you look at **blueprints **and overlay them to your build in progress via **Photoshop**/**AutoDesk Sketchbook **(*required to download*),  you'll get the correct proportions of the object you desire to build.

This is not meant to shame you in any way, I'm just giving you tips on how to build things in the correct shape and proportions. If you get easily "*offended*" in this little essay I made, you're a pillock.

creations-chat 2021-11-27 10:57:41 did you put Ballast Blocks at the ends of the ship? Lack of Ballast means that the ship has a tendency to Capsize. I also found this problem too when making my ships. I add Ballast Blocks on both ends of the ship to prevent this capsizing from ever happening.
creations-chat 2021-11-27 11:00:27 Better idea. Add more weight to the ship. And do not forget to set a waterline limit to the ship. Waterlines are important.

You'll have to call them "**Armored Cruisers**" to be consistent with the time period. The structure of the ship itself doesn't look like it came from World War I.

creations-chat 2021-12-16 08:02:43 <@!639374429532717056> The way you executed the Chaffee looked nothing like the real thing. The overall vehicle doesn't look like the Chaffee, but rather a heaping wreck. 

Learn how to get the proportions right to make it look like a Chaffee. Looks are what we're looking for, so that's why it's being downvoted.
creations-chat 2021-12-16 08:05:54 You better need more skill in motorlocking. And you better build bigger to make more space for the compression to work.

creations-chat 2021-12-17 10:37:23 I'm no expert of trains, and I'll try to explain it with the best of my ability. 
There should be wheel bases that turn independently on the two idler wheels on the front and end of the locomotive.
creations-chat 2021-12-17 10:43:21 <@!628210942231969802> "Added some Details"... Where are they?
- Add more Decals, Markings, and numbers on the plane.
- Paint the plane in any existing paint scheme such as the one presented before you below. One color planes, in my opinion, look bland to me. Paint it in a unique scheme. 
- Rockets and weapons underneath the wings are too bland. Try making them look like bombs, external fuel tanks, and Sidewinder missiles (Use sparklers, if you have, and try your best to turn them into Sidewinders with Delta Wings and motorlocking). 
- Try removing those exposed motorlocks with the best of your ability.
<@!682147422218223616> I meant text decals. There's no sign strapped or taped on the plane that say "Don't shoot me, I'm a Pilot in Training".
creations-chat 2021-12-17 10:45:56 "Firearms"... I think you meant PAYLOAD.
creations-chat 2021-12-17 10:48:21 Understandable. And somehow, the way you said those words remind me of that one builder who made a *less-detailed F4 Phantom* built ONLY for PVP and said that "*I don't care how it looks*"... Someone give me the *link to that guy's creation* if you can still remember.
creations-chat 2021-12-17 10:51:32 Here's a quick lecture for you.
**Firearms** are *Handguns used by People*. (Ex. of *Firearms*: **Mauser Kar98K**, **FN Five Seven**)
**Payload** are the *cargo/bombs stored inside/on the wings of an Aircraft or Fighter*. (Ex. of *Payload*: **SNEB Missile pods**, **External Fuel Tanks**)
creations-chat 2021-12-17 10:53:46 Explosives aren't guns. They're different.
creations-chat 2021-12-17 10:57:13 color the tail black as well. And add some trails on the end of the tail for the yellow stripes
Why am I going for the F-14 style paint scheme...
creations-chat 2021-12-17 10:59:15 Technically, that's a Fire**hand**. Not a fire**arm**.
creations-chat 2021-12-17 11:01:30 looks about okay.
creations-chat 2021-12-17 11:03:43 maybe move the wheels a bit further from the cowcatcher. Three or four blocks away, perhaps. ||Why did Rickje made sharp curves... I hope in PC2 they would make thinner gauge tracks and less sharp curves..||
creations-chat 2021-12-17 11:06:02 If my expectations are correct. I think it won't reach the Hall of Fame. 
If I were to be in the position of those people in the VIP room, then I'd say it won't make it in because the design is "too simple" based on high standards and opinions from the "council".
<@!638351121219321886> Oh yes that would be good.
creations-chat 2021-12-17 11:10:14 the panel lines, the rivets on the wings, the Balkenkreuz markings...

<@!882419947819638825> Told him to try and hide them with the best of his ability.

creations-chat 2021-12-17 11:14:44 Just add them. That's it. Some 3d models do not have the details. But you better look at reference images of planes and add the rivets in.

creations-chat 2021-12-17 11:40:40 tbh (to be honest) those main sirens better be half wedge blocks, since they look bigger afaik (as far as I know). And perhaps add some "lines" on those yellow tanks on the side of the Cadillac.

Also, a little advice. if I were you, I would have made a quick sketch of your G-107. Always draw your plane first before building it in game. Treat it as if you're an "Aeronautical Engineer" of some sort. Nice custom plane though. Reminds me of German Designs. Might even draw or "improve" your custom plane. It's missing some things that most German aircraft inherit.
creations-chat 2021-12-20 16:45:27 Gears on the tips of the wings remind me of **Tandem Undercarriage** aircraft...

creations-chat 2021-12-21 05:24:50 Well the roof cover is black to match the main color of the car. Would be quite weird to see a black 770K with a tanned roof cover. Maybe I should have it in a bluish shade of black... 
If I were to make a tan roof cover for my 770K, I should paint it in a red or burgundy color scheme.
creations-chat 2021-12-21 05:28:19 I'm thinking of making a roofed version of the 770K...
creations-chat 2021-12-21 05:30:49 nice Big Smoke pixel art.
Perhaps try to add in some external fuel tanks and bombs aside from just all rockets. And the shade of gray is a bit dark imo. Lighten it up by +5 or +7. And try to add the numbers, decals, and markings on it. Use US Navy or USAF pictures as reference.
creations-chat 2021-12-21 05:37:09 Use Emojis. Motor lock them, and you will get those USAF insignias.

And also, if you're building a German Cruiser, take my advice on this constructive criticism I've made.

creations-chat 2021-12-23 17:22:47 1. Draw out your custom vehicle on a sheet of paper or in a painting software. Be sure to draw them based on the building skills you have. 
*1.5 Look at some reference images of tanks (any era in which you prefer, ex. WWII, Cold War, Modern) and sketch them out.* 

2. Once finished, start building your custom tank. There is no time limit on finishing the build. You have plenty of time to make some corrections here and there. Take your time.
creations-chat 2021-12-23 17:25:20 Looks ugly, honestly. Because it looks like a cartoon plane rather than the actual thing. No offense. 
Also, try to pay attention to the details and overall shape of the plane itself so it can look better. I'm trying to help you with the best of my ability.

creations-chat 2021-12-28 15:36:49 <@456226577798135808> Your U-513 is missing lots of components, and the shaping of the submarine is really bad. I'd highly suggest you to try and build better. Or build another one and compare the two. And did you seriously just reposted your Submarine again?

creations-chat 2021-12-29 10:41:39 <@!755703130804584479> Your custom Fr*nch tank gives off that Warhammer vibes imo. 
Love the effort you made the tracks and all.
creations-chat 2021-12-29 10:43:40 Please do! 
<@!755703130804584479> I see. Inspiring.
creations-chat 2021-12-29 10:53:05 Imagine being a worker for a fictional Fast Food restaurant from a known TV Show as your "About Me".

creations-chat 2021-12-30 09:11:38 I have no words to describe it... It's just **Beautiful**

For some reason, it somehow reminds me of those Brickmania Humvees.
creations-chat 2021-12-30 09:13:53 Yeah...
creations-chat 2021-12-30 15:26:41 Look how he massacred my **Big Boy** <:nooo:787097964946259978>
creations-chat 2021-12-30 15:28:48 Imagine crying how disproportionate your Union Pacific Big Boy looks like and cannot be fixed. <:ElonDisapprove:589136548356685837>
creations-chat 2021-12-30 15:36:51 So in summary, in my honest and sincere opinion. This is how his "Big Boy" came to be...
creations-chat 2021-12-30 15:39:26 NO. NOT JUST THE COLOR, BUT THE ENTIRE TRAIN ITSELF, DO YOU UNDERSTAND? It really does NOT look like the Big Boy. <:RickoMode:602011035003519006>
creations-chat 2021-12-30 15:44:23 This is the most ironic thing ever... **Expert Designer**, and still failed to capture the image of the Union Pacific Big Boy...
creations-chat 2021-12-30 15:49:06 Understandable, but I have my preferences. Sure he did okay, but for me, I won't accept it.
Looks is what most of us are looking for.
creations-chat 2021-12-30 16:18:43 the entire train is what he should fix
(I still cannot get over it)
creations-chat 2021-12-30 16:21:43 Just enjoy your achievement, bucko. and I am still trying to be patient with you and your "Big Boy".
creations-chat 2021-12-31 09:51:11 <@!516436875494293524> The Buick Special doesn't have any spare tire compartment on the side of the vehicle, or antennas sticking out of the rear of the vehicle.
creations-chat 2021-12-31 09:54:02 Understandable.
creations-chat 2021-12-31 09:56:45 He might become **paranoid**, or **severely unstable** because of his whole career in Plane Crazy. A bit concerning to one's mental health. 
**Stalin** was paranoid too, had a *shit sleep schedule* and would read books before his sleep; he too was a workaholic, having to work almost 15 hours a day.
creations-chat 2021-12-31 09:58:48 So the **Su-37** is Japanese. Quite interesting. 
(fr though, I thought **Sukhoi** is a *Japanese or Korean company*) 
<@!799381636407099483> Now you have taken things a wee bit too far. Stalin was really paranoid. Hars is... somehow getting into the Paranoid side of things.
creations-chat 2021-12-31 10:00:52 Also **Ilyushin**. Which made me think it's also Japanese 🎌
creations-chat 2021-12-31 10:09:43 <@!849968686827438090> You should have used a sign and added in a gold disk emoji or yellow circle as the Headlight. That's what's missing.
Damn thats a sexy mustang
creations-chat 2021-12-31 10:11:55 And try adding a wrecking ball in reference to Sonic 1's first Boss. Just use some ropes, some blocks and wedges, and you're ready to go.
creations-chat 2021-12-31 10:15:13 You should not have done that, pal. I would have kept it in if I were you. 
Keep it so they will see what changes you have made on your creation.
creations-chat 2021-12-31 10:30:59 looks great. Motorlock the hover thruster in place
creations-chat 2021-12-31 11:01:29 I suggest you to add some Ballast Blocks and set them to their lowest setting. And try to adjust the helium on the Egg Mobile.
creations-chat 2021-12-31 11:03:36 Oh damn now that's better. I can already hear the Boss Theme from Sonic 1.

creations-chat 2022-01-01 02:35:58 When you hear those sirens getting closer, now's the time to skedaddle outta here and run for the nearest shed.
creations-chat 2022-01-01 02:52:46 <@!678986403153182772>  Let me give you a quick review on your Tu-160. 
- The Tu-160's tail should be shorter. You made it look like it was malnourished or it had been into the Gulag.
- The tail wings too should be a little bit shorter.
- Afterburner dimensions are wrong. Extend the engines a bit longer, and the jet itself has FOUR engines, not two. 
- Engine intakes should be a bit wider. 
- The shape of the Tu-160's Wings are so out of proportion that the front of your plane made it look like a Space Shuttle hybrid.

Verdict: **3/10** Uncool, Historically Inaccurate. 

Notes: Follow the blueprints and try to analyze the plane itself. Try to get the shaping of the plane right so it will actually look like the Tu-160 Blackjack. I am not hating you or anything (not yet), I am trying to help you build better with the best of my ability.
creations-chat 2022-01-01 02:57:39 One word feedback: Fantastic.
creations-chat 2022-01-01 03:23:04 Quick comparison.
creations-chat 2022-01-01 03:25:07 The Lancer has small canards on the nose.
creations-chat 2022-01-01 03:27:52 That's what college does to me, mate. And consumption of endless amounts of Coffee. 
<@!761313821235085324> yeah... but.
creations-chat 2022-01-01 03:29:54 Yeah, thanks. Hope you passed them, and a Happy New Year to you too.
creations-chat 2022-01-01 03:39:08 hi AWACSweepin
the-dump 2022-01-01 11:25:46 Mmm. Delicious Jelly beans.
creations-chat 2022-01-02 04:12:50 <@!678986403153182772> There are so many things wrong with that "Panzer III Ausf. K" of yours. Allow me to tell you the many faults and errors. 
- Entire tank is too far from the real Panzer III K. Although the variant did not exist physically, it only reached its Design stage. Never made it off the drawing board.
- The turret shape just so reminds me of the British Cruiser Mk. II. 
- Panzer III K's have six road wheels. Not five. Only applicable to the Panzer III A. 
- The rear of the Panzer III K is too far off from the real thing. 

Overall score: **2/10** Seriously Uncool. Historically Inaccurate. 

Please look at the vehicle and get the components and characteristics right.
creations-chat 2022-01-02 04:14:52 Yep. A Cruiser Tank crossdressing as a German Panzer.
<@!786182489655083049> Indeed.
creations-chat 2022-01-02 04:17:12 What scene is that from? Horror movie? Video Game?

creations-chat 2022-01-02 04:24:29 Might be this you were talking about. 
Vehicle is Neubaufahrzeug (*Nbfz*, Shortened).
creations-chat 2022-01-02 04:27:24 Holy mother of motorlocks... What is that.
creations-chat 2022-01-02 04:29:35 Yes and it exists. But Herr Schicklgruber suggested to put two more turrets on that thing (front and rear) and call it a day.

the-dump 2022-01-05 13:41:43 1. You see a really good build
2. You see a good build, but with some of the details omitted
3. You see a build with a familiar shape, but the proportions are off-hand
4. You see a build that's deemed too cursed and dubbed as a certain object (i.e. "Bismarck")
5. You see a build so bad that it was built by a child.
the-dump 2022-01-05 13:47:22 Nice reaction, and to be serious, I hope EDP would find something better. Face the consequences, and get some help from the crimes he has committed.
the-dump 2022-01-05 13:47:39 It is

the-dump 2022-01-05 13:47:54 I feel a bit bad for him as to he's getting fired all the time
the-dump 2022-01-05 13:48:14 He is not, according to SomeOrdinaryGamers
the-dump 2022-01-05 13:48:25 EDP should be jailed and should face the consequences.
the-dump 2022-01-05 13:48:31 And then get some help from a counselor
the-dump 2022-01-05 13:48:48 and yep Mutahar showed us a clip of him eating tiny bits of cupcakes
the-dump 2022-01-05 13:49:01 yeah
the-dump 2022-01-05 13:49:25 EDP better be arrested, and then get some therapy during his time in the slammer
the-dump 2022-01-05 13:49:37 he's admitted to his crimes, and he should turn up a new leaf
the-dump 2022-01-05 13:51:20 Let me slide into your DM's, since the crimes he has done are clearly against the guidelines of this community.
the-dump 2022-01-05 13:52:23 no he isn;t
the-dump 2022-01-05 13:52:31 EDP is not a member of the community

the-dump 2022-01-05 13:53:17 well its some serious stuff. This community does not allow any... how do I put it... sensitive topic about Crimes and all.
the-dump 2022-01-05 13:53:28 so I DM'd you so you will see it for yourself

creations-chat 2022-05-17 10:11:32 Looks okay, but I suggest you to make the funnels (and the ship) thinner. The funnel placement is quite asymmetric and tricky to pull off. At least I made a spacing scheme for the blocks as a guide.
creations-chat 2022-05-17 10:13:16 His hull ain't finished yet. We'll tell if the stern is complete.
creations-chat 2022-05-17 10:49:30 They look good. But you still have to thin down the funnels and make them a wee bit taller.

creations-chat 2022-05-17 12:30:26 Me too, when I looked at the blueprints.
creations-chat 2022-05-17 12:34:53 Yes, and I know how did you find out my age.

creations-chat 2022-06-18 09:19:24 <@251821807181627392> I recommend you to try and use motorlocking to make your Vintage Bugatti look better. I used heavy motorlocking on my Mercedes-Benz 770 to make it look phenomenal. 

It took me days to finish my Mercedes-Benz because of Motorlocking, somehow similar to restoring an old and vintage car which takes around years to restore. 

Motorlocking makes things look better. Trust me.
creations-chat 2022-06-18 09:56:48 What did he admire?
creations-chat 2022-06-18 09:59:36 At least try to make the nose cover by adding another layer of Motorlock.

creations-chat 2022-06-21 04:59:35 <@915471910991720499> I'm sorry to give you a negative remark on your Yamato Battleship. 

   The way you built the ship made the final product look like the Yamato got a Tumor. Please follow the blueprints and try to make an exact copy of the ship that you are building. **The colors look okay**, but the ship itself is... really questionable. 

   Next time, please try to copy what's in the blueprint/picture, so people will get a positive impression into your ships. Even I make mistakes in building stuff, but at least I did an excellent work because I have time and patience. **Time and Patience is what you need**. Shipbuilding takes a long time.
creations-chat 2022-06-21 05:05:41 <@466141758468915210> Fantastic work on your late 1930's Destroyer! 

   I really liked the way you added a custom camo scheme that can potentially be seen in World of Warships, and the portholes you've added are the Piece de Resistance to the vessel itself. I have a few words regarding with the waterline and the portholes near it. At least make the lower portholes very close to the waterline to make it more realistic, if you wish to do it. 

Another thing: I bet you based this ship from a Type 1936 A Destroyer.

The lower wing parts should be extended a bit by three or five blocks. Tail wings need to be a bit longer by two or three blocks. The canopy needs a rework, and some antennas should be added at the top of the plane (ignore the ones in the bottom, its a model).

   Ten years later, the fire has gone out for long enough, and the radiation has lowered based on what you have said. This was taken from a Mirror, since once you walk close to the Elephant's Foot, you'll die in minutes or seconds...

It's a one-of-a-kind jet that you made, and the BEA livery suits it well.

There's a few things missing to this Planet Express ship. 
1. The Turret
2. The Portholes and emergency escape door
3. That grill thing near the fins and engine. 

The tail colors need to be more dark and saturated 

Even better if the entire build is a bit bigger to show off those missing features.
creations-chat 2023-01-23 03:28:23 yeah, seems about right.
Not to pressure you, but the lower tailfins are angled down.

Try hiding the propeller engines from underneath the vehicle to make it less obvious that you used them to steer the RV. 
Also, it's better if you use half cylinders (or maybe Hover Thrusters) to use as the tires of the RV.

But still, pretty nice RV design.

You did a fine job. I'd recommend you to use half cylinders for the wheels and motorlock them. They look a bit too wide. 

Locomotive wheels are supposed to be thin, and add a little more brightness to the gray color, it bothers me.

creations-chat 2023-02-05 05:16:15 If you hear a sound in your laptop, you better clean it. Because there's dust on the ventilation, and the fan may be rusted. That can be the cause of the blue screen.

Also, remove unecessary files to save your storage space. I did that last year, and I prevented a thing like that from happening. 

I've been using a Lenovo laptop for 2 years and it's still running smooth even though it was repaired for ventilation maintenance.

creations-chat 2023-02-07 00:49:03 I think I get your point, but still, make the front wheels smaller since it looked too big for me.

creations-chat 2023-02-11 08:10:50 Why does your carrier look out or proportion… 

Yep, I am ACTUALLY critiquing your build, and sadly, the way you’re doing the carrier is wrong, especially with the hull. 

For reference of a Carrier hull, take a look at this picture of the USS Gerald Ford (CV-79). 

Also, it is impossible to make RoScale carriers because lack of space. only thing to do it is to use ALT ACCOUNTS and assemble the damn thing like you’re building an actual Aircraft Carrier.

creations-chat 2023-02-11 08:15:02 god in heaven… bless me… for I have seen the impossible… 

That is a damn good carrier, but some components are missing. 

still, it’s a build that someone really worked hard on. Better commend the guy who made it.

creations-chat 2023-03-01 07:59:51 <@742233126746587136> The term "Muscle Car" came out in 1966. Muscle Cars are typically 1960's - 1970's vehicles such as the Ford Mustang, Dodge Challenger, Pontiac GTO, and to name a few.

Naming a vehicle from the 1950's a "Muscle Car" is very anachronistic. It's best if you just call it a "Sports Coupe".

Nice INS Vikramaditya aircraft carrier! though I would like to give out a few words about your Aircraft Carrier. 

**1.)** I would recommend you to try and use **Angle Locking** on the Aircraft Carrier's ramp deck. This will make it more smoother instead of making the ramp look completely rough and bumpy. You wouldn't want to have your aircraft take off disastrously with a bumpy ramp.

**2.** Try to add those **antenna or wire things** seen on the sides of the carrier and on the ship's superstructure by using Wing Trails (i don't know what those antenna things are called).

**3.)** The ships **yellow lines and markings** are sometimes **broken lines**, so try to fix this to make your aircraft carrier more accurate to the real thing. The Helipads are not present on the landing strip of the carrier. You may add them if you wish (though I guess you're running out of space on your plot). 

**4.)** You are missing out the **AA Defenses and the rest of the radar systems** that are present on the ship. Look into the blueprints or 3d models of the Vessel so you can find the other missing details on your ship (like I mentioned earlier, you're probably running out of plot space to fit the whole ship). 

In conclusion, your Aircraft Carrier is great, though there are a few components missing on the final build. I know you might not make changes because you have no more space to place them. I wish that you'll follow my recommendations so you can improve your excellent aircraft carrier.

Your **CH-53E Super Stallion** is okay, though there are some problems that I would like to point out that make this build a bit not good. 

The **helicopter blades** are sort of messy in terms of the way you built it, but it gets better if you find a different way in constructing Heli blades. 

The **colors** are a bit too dark, so I would highly recommend you to make the gray tones brighter… UNLESS if it’s a specific paint scheme that has the colors on the final product. 

Try to have the **landing gear** retract like in the real thing. 

You’re even missing some **windows** on the sides of the Helicopter. Not only that but lots of the **details** are missing as well…

…and the Helicopter is **out of shape** when you view it from the sides. 

Overall, you did… ***okay-ish*** <:YouTried:559530066258821131> on the Super Stallion, and I hope you’ll learn new techniques in building things.

creations-chat 2023-05-09 06:22:13 Hello <@794418633577070615>. 

There are many reasons as to why your rendition of the German Battlecruiser (or Battleship) Scharnhorst is literally crap and I'll be brutally honest to give you the many reasons why. 

First off is the entire hull of the ship itself. The shape of Scharnhorst's hull is quite *curvy*', not boxy like what you did. On some of my Battleships that I made, I would always make my hulls curved to stay true to the Blueprints. What you did was pretty much outdated and incompetent. It almost felt like a *Tutorial Scharnhorst*. 

You did fine with the Main Guns of the Battleship, though there are some details missing. I didn't like the way you did the Secondary Turrets of the Battleship because they are sort of thick in my perspective, whereas in the real ship, the secondary guns are quite small due to their caliber size. 

You didn't finish the camo scheme which is the *Baltic Camouflage* Paint Scheme. Also, the way you did Scharnhorst's Paint Scheme is completely ***TERRIBLE***. 

You're missing a LOT of components that were present on the Scharnhorst, a **LOT** of them. 

Those are some of the reasons why your Scharnhorst is ***UTTER CRAP***. 

Overall, there are so many things missing from your rendition of the Battleship Scharnhorst. You didn't put any time and effort in building a warship. I would highly encourage you to ***IMPROVE YOUR BUILDING SKILLS*** to make things better. 

*Sincerely yours,*
*the_mechanic2001*

Your build is quite rushed. Patience is what makes good builds.

creations-chat 2023-05-14 03:43:41 <@831675577828245555> Hello DevenTIE. 

I really appreciate your custom English Estate, though it does not feel 18th Century to me. I am quite impressed and unimpressed with the entire build to be honest. I’ll point out some problems on why I am quite disappointed with the build. 

First off. It doesn’t feel 18th Century. The 18th Century are the years 1700 to 1799. Your architectural style is too far off from that of the period. The White House even is an 18th Century building, so you better take inspiration from that or any buildings built in the 1700’s (18th Century). 

Second of all, the windows felt like you have built a custom jailhouse rather than an estate. The colors too are quite Jailhouse-ish, so it kinda felt that way. 

Overall, I really like the effort you did on your “18th Century British Estate”, but I advise you to look up the architectural style of the period and get the proportions right in some areas. 

*Sincerely,*
*the_mechanic2001*
*Plane Crazy Player and Build Connoisseur*

His friend, Thomas J. Hudner Jr. tried to save him, but failed. He tried again many years later, but wasn’t able to due to bad weather. Now that Hudner had passed away, he’s able to see his Wingman in the afterlife. 

It would have been more appropriate to have the plane be destroyed into pieces, since the US Navy don’t want the wreck to be captured by the enemy; and also gave Brown a “Viking Funeral”.

Also, there’s two planes on the wreck site.

creations-chat 2023-06-21 09:37:41 Hello <@1074832981488836748>  

   I am pretty much appreciative with the effort you made with your custom warship. 

Although I can see the resemblance between that thing and an Admiral Hipper Class Cruiser in which you didn’t specify, I’ll give you a little word of advice when making Cruisers. 

The hull looks a bit too narrow for a cruiser, and it looked really silly to be one. I would advise you to make the hull more wider to make it more appropriate for a cruiser hull. 

I know you’ll run out of space if you try to widen the cruiser, and I appreciate the ffort you did in making a good-looking Warship. 

Sincerely Yours

creations-chat 2023-07-02 09:22:52 Can I look at the jet from the top view?
creations-chat 2023-07-02 09:30:03 Better start fixing the wings, and make the fuselage a bit more slimmer.

Also, fix those elevators, they look fat.
the-dump 2023-07-02 10:04:35 I dunno if the fr*nce situation is political or not
creations-chat 2023-07-02 10:33:57 You didn’t make the elevators (wings in the back) smaller, though nice work on the wings.

Excellent Hudson… 

# NOW STREAMLINE IT.
creations-chat 2023-07-02 11:40:18 Good luck. 

Use up all of your space wisely to make it tall.
creations-chat 2023-07-02 11:42:24 Oh, and I have already made a STREAMLINED NYC HUDSON, and it was years ago. 

I might have plans on rebuilding this thing. Also, it’s almost RoScale.
creations-chat 2023-07-02 11:44:26 That’s right!
creations-chat 2023-07-02 11:47:42 I deleted it by accident, but don’t worry, you’ll see more trains… 

I’ll show you them tomorrow, though the Time Zones will make things complicated.

<@986395564126134363> Start with a simple one: GWR 57XX Pannier Tank.
creations-chat 2023-07-02 11:50:26 Alright.
creations-chat 2023-07-02 11:53:08 yes. start off small, then continue with the big one.
creations-chat 2023-07-02 11:58:51 At least two passenger cars and a Brake Van.
creations-chat 2023-07-02 12:06:52 I know. Though there’s a Braked version of a coach. 

Let’s say that it’s run by a Heritage Railway with no brake coach.
