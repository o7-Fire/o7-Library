Yeah but it's not impossible
creations-chat 2021-11-18 13:55:32 yes, 

but I think it's better not to do it, since those white details on the fuselage were boring so don't need to do, it was just a suggestion.
Yeah angle 0.9 its a good idea, But how are going to put the sign? You'll have to push it back 0.1?

creations-chat 2021-11-28 11:46:09 angle a wing
creations-chat 2021-11-28 11:50:40 i mean this part, because in your jet, the space between the canards and the front wedge is straight
creations-chat 2021-11-28 16:00:18 yeah its better, but if you want you can try to angle it to make it straighter too, and also change the cylinders to another flat block

creations-chat 2021-12-06 02:04:10 <@673670368757678106> I think you made the black hole a little wrong, The real black hole sphere is much bigger and these parts that are thrown out are part of another massive body that was sucked.

The weapons and the back engine too

creations-chat 2022-01-02 23:12:34 <@821642310491570196> good but organize your keys and take good angles (without the keys)
creations-chat 2022-01-03 05:10:07 no too short
creations-chat 2022-01-03 14:42:37 Cylinder is good but fix the body, it's weird to have a cockpit all circular and a whole square body

And remove the exposed motor
creations-chat 2022-01-03 14:45:14 <@716763827844415528> I liked the project, try to make it in a bigger version to be prettier and with more details

<@702907851001167882> yes, in the drawing it was better, if he redo the jet in a bigger version, it would be more real and better, probably
creations-chat 2022-01-03 20:14:23 <@456226577798135808> can i see without amonged?
creations-chat 2022-01-03 20:17:00 It's reasonable, do you want to try to redo it?

creations-chat 2022-01-06 02:23:34 <@456226577798135808> I think the f-5 is too fat and tall, the neck angle is too flat, it doesn't look like it's there, and the half cylinders on the stab are weird too, the intakes are high and the wings is too small

Idk try to redo or make a little bigger, the first time I saw it I thought it was custom, only later I noticed it was an f5
creations-chat 2022-01-06 03:30:35 n
creations-chat 2022-01-08 18:44:00 <@674280599724228608> very nice, but the wheels are small and strange, try to make it bigger

Try custom wheels
creations-chat 2022-01-08 18:46:15 So it would be better to make a 3x3 with bigger wheels
