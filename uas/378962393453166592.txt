creations-chat 2020-09-28 10:30:29 Tanks take a while to fabricate so expect a waiting period
creations-chat 2020-09-28 10:31:05 Especially since I wait to experiment with working tracks soon
creations-chat 2020-09-28 10:32:41 I thought of a genius idea
creations-chat 2020-09-28 10:35:02 I've joined like 5 or 6 days ago
creations-chat 2020-09-28 10:35:40 I like this game 
In the start its a little complicated but once you get the hang of it it's smooth sailing
creations-chat 2020-09-28 10:37:46 Some bugs are fixable while building
Like some small issues like accidently gluing the tank turret to the  tonk
creations-chat 2020-09-28 10:38:45 I've done it yesterday more than I liked
creations-chat 2020-09-28 10:39:05 My maus has terrible turret traverse
creations-chat 2020-09-28 10:39:21 It gets stuck all the damn time
creations-chat 2020-09-28 10:41:59 Could it be because the bottom blocks are grettinf stuck on the top part of the hull?
creations-chat 2020-09-28 10:43:20 You already have enough pvp rockets to obliterate the MOON

creations-chat 2020-10-08 16:01:44 New update:
Conveyer drives can now be used to power shredders

And shredders deal 5x damage
creations-chat 2020-10-08 16:03:09 > Expunge this man from the surface of earth
Do it
creations-chat 2020-10-08 16:03:25 > make shredders a bannable offense üòé
Best idea ever
creations-chat 2020-10-08 16:04:06 Shredders
creations-chat 2020-10-08 16:04:26 Cutters are used on other things aswell
Shredders are just plain Anoying
Blacklist them the moment you see them
creations-chat 2020-10-08 16:05:01 I just gun spam them and despawn the moment they get close
Like bro you don't deserve the gratification of a kill
creations-chat 2020-10-08 16:05:51 Just make a bait box
creations-chat 2020-10-08 16:06:07 Let them fly into it

AND KABLOWE
creations-chat 2020-10-08 16:06:47 Where'd everyone go
creations-chat 2020-10-08 16:08:43 "Dont blacklist shedders, it makes it so they pass through your build and they can kill your character, it destroys your entire build"
They don't have enough IQ to know that
creations-chat 2020-10-08 16:09:03 The avarage IQ of a shredder user is -10
creations-chat 2020-10-08 16:09:20 Just gun and rocket spam them
creations-chat 2020-10-08 16:09:36 And despawn to your plot once they get close
creations-chat 2020-10-08 16:09:52 They don't deserve kills
creations-chat 2020-10-08 16:11:23 Or best of both worlds

Taunt them
Then slaughter them
creations-chat 2020-10-08 16:11:44 Blow all those speakers up immediately
creations-chat 2020-10-08 16:12:26 Is the null zone the death barrier st like -4k blocks

I'll probably do a ln iron cross
creations-chat 2020-10-13 21:45:25 Since I want the battleship to  atleast side with the right country and not algebra
creations-chat 2020-10-13 21:47:08 We have 4 years
Year 1 and 2 are at a rivalry of who is the most Anoying
And year 3 and 4 are Banding together to keep them in their zones

creations-chat 2020-10-14 13:20:49 correct
nothing
creations-chat 2020-10-14 20:41:48 It's pretty self explanatory really quad
WHY 2 MINUTE COOLDOWN
Might aswell remove this channel now because 2 min cooldown makes any conversation litarly useless
Quad, it says "creations" and you post something that isint creations its gona get removed
creations-chat 2020-10-14 21:34:13 I hate those "you must now use [insert random thing here] for 10 minutes" images

Anybody posting them should be executed for crimes against humanity


Also remove this channel or change the cooldown because 2 minute slowmode makes chatting impossible
creations-chat 2020-10-14 21:36:30 2 minute cooldown also stopped any form of chatting in this chat

\/
Because mods are stupid
creations-chat 2020-10-14 21:38:31 What moron actually put it in though and thought "yea that's totally not going to murder the intire purpose of this chat"

I'm not native English so

If the cooldown won't get removed you can practically remove this channel because it serves no purpose anymore
creations-chat 2020-10-14 21:45:37 That atleast makes chatting somewhat possible noe
