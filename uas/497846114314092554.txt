creations-chat 2020-11-21 23:52:19 also I can definitively say I like most of my builds
creations-chat 2020-11-21 23:55:00 alright cool now explain why three people have decided that a land submarine is directly offending them
creations-chat 2020-11-21 23:57:40 where do you see the problem
creations-chat 2020-11-22 00:00:20 1.it's just common sense to not have a bridge if I'm not getting out
2.everyone in the pvp server already says that it's actually a tank, I needed the ballast blocks to spell it out to them
3.perfectly round would need cylinders

it's designed to kill things and be fast, not to look nice
creations-chat 2020-11-22 00:03:30 what the hell do you think a good pvp build looks like
creations-chat 2020-11-22 00:05:15 my land submarine cleans out pvp servers because it's designed to kill things, not to look really cool
creations-chat 2020-11-22 00:08:06 the outstanding mechanism on the land submarine is that it shoots things and goes fast
creations-chat 2020-11-22 00:11:03 I came back to say that your designs are entirely cosmetic
