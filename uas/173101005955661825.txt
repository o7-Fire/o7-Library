plane-crazy 2019-07-28 17:07:28 That place is pronounced Nygeer though
plane-crazy 2019-07-19 17:56:40 Put some motors on there, and call it variable pitch. Holy shit.
plane-crazy 2019-07-19 17:56:28 Way beyond that.
plane-crazy 2019-07-19 17:56:24 Technology has moved on.
plane-crazy 2019-07-19 17:56:16 Y'all over here arguing about fixed prop pitch.
plane-crazy 2019-07-18 13:39:44 Although that track looks awesome.
plane-crazy 2019-07-18 13:39:25 I agree
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 11:31:30 I don't know
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 11:31:29 *if* I went wrong.
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 11:31:20 I look at the two, and wonder where I went wrong. 'Cause they look the same.

plane-crazy 2019-07-14 11:31:06 I did the Sakura Swashplate.

plane-crazy 2019-07-14 11:30:19 Uh.
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 11:29:41 I don't know what it is.
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 11:29:38 That or my heli is too big.
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 11:29:30 'Cause the heli won't even get off the ground.
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 11:29:23 Tried the swashplate design a minute ago. 

I fucked it up, or it doesn't work anymore.
