the-dump 2019-07-16 11:12:22 Really?
the-dump 2019-07-16 11:12:27 Interesting.
the-dump 2019-07-16 11:12:34 First time I ran across.
the-dump 2019-07-16 16:14:13 Ah, but you see.

the-dump 2019-07-18 12:50:58 What game was that in?
help 2019-07-18 13:35:28 Sawshplate has already been made. But I don't know if it actually works.
help 2019-07-18 13:35:32 Hell I may have done it wrong.
help 2019-07-18 13:35:38 But if you make a swashplate that's innovative.
help 2019-07-18 13:35:43 It's a step in the right direction.
help 2019-07-18 13:36:18 To be frank, I didn't make it. I replicated it to incorporate it into a heli.
help 2019-07-18 13:36:36 It's pinned in the <#384025409945337856> channel as well.
