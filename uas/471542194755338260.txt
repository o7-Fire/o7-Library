plane-crazy 2020-06-02 19:41:31 what
plane-crazy 2020-06-02 19:41:14 doesnt even move fast smh
plane-crazy 2020-06-02 19:41:11 its supposed to be sonic
plane-crazy 2020-06-02 19:40:49 its actually walking
plane-crazy 2020-06-02 19:40:42 its sonic
plane-crazy 2020-06-02 19:30:48 people just see anything and then just say "lol"
plane-crazy 2020-06-02 19:26:03 I'm making a different big thing now tho
plane-crazy 2020-06-02 19:25:59 infinitely
plane-crazy 2020-06-02 19:25:57 > what about a hover thruster engine?
I'm pretty sure it'd just make it go in one direction infintiely
plane-crazy 2020-06-02 18:59:10 I'm just gonna work on something else for now
plane-crazy 2020-06-02 18:58:34 Seems like conveyor engines don't work properly either, they kinda lag too and move to the side even though the conveyors are facing forwards, sothe ship moves to the side too
plane-crazy 2020-06-02 18:54:16 and magnet engines arent actually that good for movign big builds
plane-crazy 2020-06-02 18:54:08 try
plane-crazy 2020-06-02 18:54:07 it lags me whne i tr
plane-crazy 2020-06-02 18:54:03 i can't use a magnet engine
plane-crazy 2020-06-02 18:53:23 If I wanted to, I'd need to place a billion everywhere on it and it'd be really bad
plane-crazy 2020-06-02 18:53:12 The wings stuff
plane-crazy 2020-06-02 18:53:04 It won't line up with the center of mass
plane-crazy 2020-06-02 18:52:53 I did once,a nd I already explained why I can't add wings there
plane-crazy 2020-06-02 18:51:29 Still want it to be able to like, actually fly tho
plane-crazy 2020-06-02 18:50:52 But I could try and experiment with magnet engines
plane-crazy 2020-06-02 18:50:47 It lags a bit when starting up, and I heard conveyor egnines lag with big builds
plane-crazy 2020-06-02 18:49:10 And of course, because motors hate me, it moved the middle actual ship part so that it wouldn't even move kinda properly
plane-crazy 2020-06-02 18:48:49 I made it so I could move them around but I didn't save it cause it didn't really work that well
plane-crazy 2020-06-02 18:47:50 
plane-crazy 2020-06-02 18:47:43 there's a lotta space in them
plane-crazy 2020-06-02 18:47:40 enough to get it to move
plane-crazy 2020-06-02 18:47:32 Well, not full, but has like
plane-crazy 2020-06-02 18:47:17 But the big things on the sides are full of rockets that move it forwards
plane-crazy 2020-06-02 18:47:10 It doesn't even look that good anyways
plane-crazy 2020-06-02 18:47:05 This is the ship
plane-crazy 2020-06-02 18:46:26 It won't really look that good since I want it to not look like a weird mess
plane-crazy 2020-06-02 18:44:32 in the air
plane-crazy 2020-06-02 18:44:29 actually move around
plane-crazy 2020-06-02 18:44:27 It just can't like
plane-crazy 2020-06-02 18:44:23 It uses rockets to move
plane-crazy 2020-06-02 18:38:58 my coolest build so far doesnt even fly because i dont really have a good hiding spot for the wings and i'd need to place a billion everywhere for the stuff to line up ðŸ˜”
plane-crazy 2020-06-02 18:37:44 
plane-crazy 2020-06-02 18:36:38 that looks cool
plane-crazy 2020-06-02 18:32:45 at least your submarines dont always tilt up on one side underwater no matter what you do
plane-crazy 2020-06-02 18:30:22 
plane-crazy 2020-05-28 21:09:37 Superstrength seems to make it go slower, too
plane-crazy 2020-05-28 21:05:04 not forwards
plane-crazy 2020-05-28 21:05:02 but
plane-crazy 2020-05-28 21:05:01 It can go backwards
plane-crazy 2020-05-28 21:04:48 is enabling superstrength on small magnet engines supposed to make them unable to go forwards
plane-crazy 2020-05-28 20:10:33 It gets increasingly larger
plane-crazy 2020-05-28 20:10:17 Some dude made a tear in space and time
plane-crazy 2020-05-27 17:40:07 like, it's usually symmetrical so there's the same amount of stuff on both sides
plane-crazy 2020-05-27 17:39:42 whenever i make something that goes under the water, the back ALWAYS points up and i don't know why <:pain:644301805534183464>
plane-crazy 2020-05-26 18:30:18 most of the big builds that fly don't seem to have a billion wing panels n stuff all over them but also don't seem to have a space they're hidden in
plane-crazy 2020-05-26 18:29:39 how in the world do you make big builds fly
plane-crazy 2020-05-25 19:42:10 
plane-crazy 2020-05-25 19:00:55 smh, children
plane-crazy 2020-05-25 19:00:41 The kid who got flung just blacklisted me and said "get noobed" and is acting like I'm crying because he said "weird" and some toher things
plane-crazy 2020-05-25 18:54:05 this dude has something that seems to be a flinging machine so i blacklisted him because he went over to my area and flung someone off it with another thing earlier and he blacklisted me out of spite
plane-crazy 2020-05-25 18:53:42 its kinda funny when people blacklist you because you blacklist them
plane-crazy 2020-05-25 18:39:58 PVP servers are kinda boring because its mostly just people who sit near spawn spots and fire rockets at anyone who spawns a build
plane-crazy 2020-05-25 17:13:30 this si the gamer cylinder
plane-crazy 2020-05-25 17:13:25 
plane-crazy 2020-05-25 17:08:26 guys this is ym c reation <33 how it look
plane-crazy 2020-05-14 18:56:37 motors not rotating correctly ruin so many builds i try to make
plane-crazy 2020-05-14 18:46:09 Whichever part the dark gray part of the propellor is on doesn't even change anything, though it seems like it should
plane-crazy 2020-05-14 18:45:18 Discord also said the uploads failed then proceeded to send them a second after
plane-crazy 2020-05-14 18:45:05 Still ca'nt delete em
plane-crazy 2020-05-14 18:44:09 W
plane-crazy 2020-05-14 18:44:08 i'm messing around and making something that cna pp ick stuff up
plane-crazy 2020-05-14 18:43:48 yeah
plane-crazy 2020-05-14 18:43:44 <:pain:644301805534183464>
plane-crazy 2020-05-14 18:43:41 I had a propellor on top earlier, and it would spin THIS instead of the propellor
plane-crazy 2020-05-14 18:43:28 but discord won't send it
plane-crazy 2020-05-14 18:43:23 Also I tried sending an image
plane-crazy 2020-05-14 18:43:13 It woudl spin the propellor, but it would ONLY spin the propellor to go down
plane-crazy 2020-05-14 18:42:30 I try and make like, somethign with a big propellor on top, and instead of turning the propellor, it turns the thing that shouldn't turn
plane-crazy 2020-05-14 18:40:27 motors never turn the thing i want them to unless i make wheels <:pain:644301805534183464>
plane-crazy 2020-05-04 16:44:33 sometimes my magnet engine machines get a mind of their own after i land on the island and exit them and they pick up speed and fall off
plane-crazy 2020-05-04 16:05:05 until you accidentally go too far and now you're stuck flying into hte endless void
plane-crazy 2020-05-04 16:04:52 laugh in engine
plane-crazy 2020-05-04 16:04:45 imagine needing wheels when you can just use magnet engines
plane-crazy 2020-05-02 22:42:11 what is the team even for
plane-crazy 2020-05-02 18:21:01 I'm guessing they're either edgy 16 year olds who think cursing around young kids is funny, or trolls
plane-crazy 2020-05-02 18:20:36 Well, one of em just left
plane-crazy 2020-05-02 18:18:14 They're sayin "YOU ALWAYS WANNA BE RIGHT"
plane-crazy 2020-05-02 18:16:21 its a different dude than the lag maker
plane-crazy 2020-05-02 18:15:44 They're now calling me entitled and cursing at me and being like "yOu onL y CaRE iF uR rIghT !1!!"
plane-crazy 2020-05-02 18:11:30 and this other dude just called me a piece of crap and acted as if breaking rules did'nt matter
plane-crazy 2020-05-02 18:07:57 Unfortunately, i didn't get a screenashot
plane-crazy 2020-05-02 18:07:50 AHAHA He was actually on the plot next to me and changed it and was like "yea' when i thought they left
plane-crazy 2020-05-02 18:05:31 Someone built A Bad but they covered upt he name part of the basepalte
plane-crazy 2020-05-02 17:45:31 the normal wheels mess up on some builds and act weird, or they're too small or big, and also go too fast
plane-crazy 2020-05-02 17:44:40 i wish i could use custom wheels and have htem turn without having to do a ton of things
plane-crazy 2020-05-02 17:29:03 so no more lag
plane-crazy 2020-05-02 17:28:58 fortunately
plane-crazy 2020-05-02 17:28:56 nitrionn left like a few seconds ago
plane-crazy 2020-05-02 17:27:53 this jim is d
plane-crazy 2020-05-02 17:26:39 and this isnt on pvp
plane-crazy 2020-05-02 17:26:36 i dontw ant to make a lag machine just because someone else is
plane-crazy 2020-05-02 17:25:51 windows 7/8
plane-crazy 2020-05-02 17:25:49 its like
plane-crazy 2020-05-02 17:25:37 and he was like "THATS AN INSULT DIRECTED AT ME"
plane-crazy 2020-05-02 17:25:24 and said that it's mostly just really basic rockets
plane-crazy 2020-05-02 17:25:15 I talked about how my server usually has big laggy things that join
plane-crazy 2020-05-02 17:25:01 because i "insulted his truck"
plane-crazy 2020-05-02 17:24:58 and he went over to my place and blew it up on me
plane-crazy 2020-05-02 17:24:51 It momentarily lags
plane-crazy 2020-05-02 17:24:33 He lags the server by exploding his truck
plane-crazy 2020-05-02 17:24:27 Nitrionn
plane-crazy 2020-05-02 17:23:52 Thuis dude
plane-crazy 2020-05-02 17:04:58 I was like "this isn't plane crazy"and then I realzied
plane-crazy 2020-05-02 01:48:02 Matbe not
plane-crazy 2020-05-02 01:48:01 Maybe
plane-crazy 2020-05-02 01:41:42 vips
plane-crazy 2020-05-02 01:41:42 public vis
plane-crazy 2020-05-02 01:41:41 is there like
plane-crazy 2020-05-02 01:41:39 VIP1?
plane-crazy 2020-05-02 01:40:58 
plane-crazy 2020-05-02 01:40:06 The house from up and the battlebus are on th esame server
plane-crazy 2020-05-02 01:39:59 Bruh moment
plane-crazy 2020-05-02 01:38:24 Tihs flies.
plane-crazy 2020-05-02 01:25:22 SOMEONE MADE THE HOUSE FROM UP AND I JUST SEE IT FLOATING IN THE DISTNAC EIAJDEFJAD
plane-crazy 2020-05-02 01:21:51 making a big tree and the helicopter seeds
plane-crazy 2020-05-02 01:21:44 YO i just had a cool idea
plane-crazy 2020-05-02 01:12:52 he be kinda walkin doe
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 20:30:24 <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ>
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 20:30:00 yeah
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 20:29:47 i wanted to rickroll him
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 20:29:44 darnit
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 20:29:30 in dms
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 20:29:28 ill send you a link explaining it tfi
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 20:28:52 both
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 20:28:49 it flotas up but it spins
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 20:28:46 yea
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 20:28:45 still spins tho
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 20:28:29 I'm working on a tiny helicopter and it finally spins when flying way less
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 19:44:45 Why is it always the servers I'M in that have people who have ginormous hulking machines that cause lag because they're so big join
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 19:37:12 This random seat in the middle of nowhere is mgihty suspicious
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 19:37:05 Mighta found it
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 19:36:44 i dont know where the balls orgiinated from
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 19:36:14 Someone on this server made a buidl that I'm pretty sure is just a ton of spheres and their seat and there's now a bunch of white spheres all over the map
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 19:32:32 the camera
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 19:32:31 Only happens when I have wings
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 19:31:53 Another annoying glitch is when the blue marker doesnt appear when placing wings so you have to go to a new server
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 19:31:38 I hopped servers and ti's still there
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 19:31:28 It happens to me a LOT
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 19:30:59 why does the game INSIST that i use a certain camera angle whenever i fly a plane (it only does itw hen it has wings i think)
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 19:25:00 they were like "how do I get to thge egg island" as if the tutorial button didnt exist
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 19:24:41 ya
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 19:24:18 ive goten the easter egg like 3-4 times
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 19:24:13 people who asked "HOW DO I GET THE EGG???!?!?? WHERE GEG" during the event were also annoying
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 19:23:53 it was annoying a few times
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 19:23:50 ah
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 19:23:31 yknow, the one where it makes them go "LB.LBLBBLBLBLLBLBLBLBLBUBBGPOBFGP[" instead of normal noises
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 19:23:22 I've encountered the propeller easter egg a few tmes
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 19:21:53 i found outw hen trying to make a weird caterpillar/inchowrm thing and hten tested it out with another thing
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 19:21:39 Flapping wings instead of normal plane wings ***kindof*** works
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 19:20:56 other than the seat color
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 19:20:52 They don't really seem to have any difference
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 19:20:48 Like, the seats with the blue cushion
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 19:20:31 Not main pilots
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 19:20:06 what's the differnet between normal seats and pilot seats??
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 19:19:59 also
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 19:19:57 it can barely hold anyone
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 19:19:24 this is ym really bad vehicle that lags when it moves + uses a bunch of customw heels
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 19:16:39 superstrength/editing the srtength of my magets messes up the magnet engines
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 19:14:56 really annoying
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 19:14:55 the game will randomly set my camera when i start my plane for some reason
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 19:14:40 i dont think i have any screendhsots of it unfortunately
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 19:14:19 blocks
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 19:14:17 I forogt how many but I think it was over like 8000 or smth??
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 19:14:05 it algged EVERYONE super hard but it looked super cool
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 19:13:57 ive seen a GINORMOUS build that was made ouitta like a billion blocks
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 19:13:31 i make really bad looking, super simple things
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 19:13:12 i dont make big stuff
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 19:13:01 idk
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 19:12:31 i might call it a magnet engine a few times since I normally use magnet engines whne making stuff
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 19:12:11 my conveyor engine doesnt lag
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 19:11:18 i havent really seen that muchother than it just flipping out afte rit does lots of turns, flies kinda slowly, and just stops altogether when hitting terrain
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 19:10:48 it doesnt really function like how people describe it but i think it can go pretty fast
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 19:10:23 
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 19:09:44 i have made a custom conveoyr engine ðŸ˜Ž
