plane-crazy 2020-02-09 14:39:20 Often happens that when my boat goes at 150 speed its more like 90 or so

plane-crazy 2020-02-09 14:35:38 Why does my helicopter not work at full graphics but when i set it to 1 it works perfectly

plane-crazy 2020-02-08 20:24:56 Motor 1 is useful for when my boat is stationary.Motor 2 is useful for when my boat is moving so instead of having to use wasd for the boat and qerf for the turret i just use motor 2.Im asking for a motor i could use for a turret that would change from motor 1 to 2 and vice versa at the click of a button since motor 2 is harder to aim since i need high speed motors to keep up to planes and if i increase the speed too much it becomes hard af to aim.

plane-crazy 2019-12-11 19:44:55 Do the motors on the rotor need to have the same inclination controls or inverted
