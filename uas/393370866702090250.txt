bot-central 2020-08-24 23:36:29 &suggest
 Gun changes 
(PvP)
  
Guns should be more configurable.
For example you should be able to chance the bullets your gun shoots mm.From 7-40mm.The more you increase it the fire rate will be slower and each shot that hits will deal more damage.
Ammo belt types: 
Armor piercing bullets: These will deal more damage to a single block it hits 
Incendiary:These would deal lower impact damage than AP bullets but would have a DoT which would give them more overall damage (Burning DoT) and they would affect a single block.They would also explode any fuel tanks they hit
Hight explosive:These would deal damage to blocks in a radius of 3x3 with higher damage on the block that was hit and lower damage on its the edge blocks.They would deal lower damage on a single block but more overall counting in the edge blocks that are also by it compared to AP bullets.These should be much better at destroying wings or should deal more damage to them than AP bullets
Tracers:Bullets that deal less damage than AP but leave a visible trace like current bullets do
There are also a lot of other
Belts:Unless its too hard to add these too it would be nice if you could customise the belts each of your guns shoots.For example:Ground targets belt:Bullet 1:AP 2:AP 3:AP 4:T
Stealth:(Used for air to air combat):1:AP 2:AP 3:I 4:HE
Air to air:1:AP 2:T 3:I 4:HE 
Belts would be fired from bullet 1 to bullet XX there being a fair limit of 10 to belt ammunition customisation
Guns should receive a damage buff as outside of having them stacked they deal very little damage making air to air combat reliant on rockets
