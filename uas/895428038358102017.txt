the-dump 2023-06-10 17:04:34 the remote turret is a good idea, making it so that crew survivability is sky high
the-dump 2023-06-10 17:06:29 it‚Äôs relevant
the-dump 2023-06-10 17:06:43 shows that tanks can be absolutely useless if used incorrectly
the-dump 2023-06-10 17:07:14 in this case, it shows that western tech, just like all other tank tech, is prone to artillery strikes
the-dump 2023-06-10 17:07:30 T-14 armanta, toast in artillery
the-dump 2023-06-10 17:07:40 Abrams X, toast in artillery
the-dump 2023-06-10 17:08:14 all tanks are horrible at withstanding artillery strikes due to the sheer power and size a artillery shell has
the-dump 2023-06-10 17:09:05 and like almost all tanks out there, some have been captured
the-dump 2023-06-10 17:09:16 ISIS has a few Abrams that were captured
the-dump 2023-06-10 17:10:23 the small differences in tech doesn‚Äôt mean much, a tank is still a tank and will cause a massive amount of destruction no matter how old it is
the-dump 2023-06-10 17:10:46 it all comes down to training and circumstances
the-dump 2023-06-10 19:17:45 yea idk what it‚Äôs for
the-dump 2023-06-10 19:17:56 it seems to try to be everything
the-dump 2023-06-10 19:18:08 I discovered a design flaw with it
the-dump 2023-06-10 19:18:38 if you hit the turret ring at a specific angle, it will kill the entire crew
the-dump 2023-06-10 19:20:26 and it will weld the turret to the chassis and a lot more bad stuff, making it so that it is 100% impossible to salvage a destroyed Abrams X
the-dump 2023-06-10 23:30:15 it‚Äôs a design flaw
the-dump 2023-06-11 00:13:20 no design is perfect
the-dump 2023-06-11 00:13:42 the T-14 and Abrams X have some major design flaws
the-dump 2023-06-11 00:14:01 but they‚Äôre both extremely impressive technology that is a proof of concept
the-dump 2023-06-11 00:14:39 reliable? absolutely not, they are to push to forefront of technology and hopefully pave the way for iterations on the proofs of concept
the-dump 2023-06-11 00:16:23 imo aircraft are a different story, a proof of concept is very rare amongst new aircraft
the-dump 2023-06-11 00:17:05 they tend to be a lot more conservative and a lot less gamebreaking technology that pushes the forefront of human imagination
the-dump 2023-06-11 00:17:24 only small improvements between each aircraft model
the-dump 2023-06-11 00:18:35 but the T-14 and Abrams X is insane, they both are pushing human capabilities by employing the most modern tech out there, although a lot of it may not work due to just how new and innovative these new design concepts are
the-dump 2023-06-11 00:25:28 not what I said, both are extremely engineered and are a proof of concept rather than yet another small innovation
the-dump 2023-06-11 00:26:43 fair ig
the-dump 2023-06-11 00:27:38 but to sum it up, they aren‚Äôt the most reliable due to their ground breaking tech
the-dump 2023-06-11 10:58:03 fair, maybe a few will be used but you‚Äôre probably right when you say that it‚Äôs gonna be nearly nonexistent on the battlefield when/if they make a working one
