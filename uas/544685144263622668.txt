`9:` **NO EXCESSIVE MINI-MODDING**
While actions such as telling someone to post something in a different channel help the staff out a lot, please do not excessively mini-mod (ex: Forcing someone to provide proof that they're 13+, etc). Leave this to actual staff.

I didnt see anything about linking an account, but i did see this rule politely asking you to not do what you're doing
creations-chat 2023-07-05 00:09:13 so why do you need me to do this? the rules say nothing about linking a roblox account, and i have no idea who you are
creations-chat 2023-07-05 00:11:56 Here are all the rules: ­
`9:` **NO EXCESSIVE MINI-MODDING**
While actions such as telling someone to post something in a different channel help the staff out a lot, please do not excessively mini-mod (ex: Forcing someone to provide proof that they're 13+, etc). Leave this to actual staff.

`10:` **NO ADVERTISING**
Unsolicited advertising is not allowed here. If you want to promote things like your YouTube channel here, see <#537387160261885962> for a set of requirements.

`11:` **EXPLOITING IS NOT ALLOWED**
Exploiting in Plane Crazy is not allowed. If you post an image or video of yourself using external scripts to exploit Plane Crazy, **you will be permanently banned from this Discord server**. This ban is non-negotiable.

***Even if something is not listed as a rule here, if you don't think it's allowed then it isn't.***

**Need assistance with something? Ping a server moderator! Please refrain from pinging <@&706009538897117185> unless no other mods are responding.**   If there is something here that says i have to link, then i will link (oh fuck the copy paste didnt work)
creations-chat 2023-07-05 00:14:39 So i dont have to link my rblx acc?
creations-chat 2023-07-05 00:17:22 thx aftersock! You deserve the W
creations-chat 2023-07-05 00:21:04 lol, this is why i like this place
creations-chat 2023-07-10 00:16:08 Its a WIP bombardier dash 8, do you guys have any advice? (the wings were anglelocked)
creations-chat 2023-07-10 00:21:19 makes sense, but the wings of the real plane are about this wide, so maybe i make it longer
creations-chat 2023-07-10 00:24:41 the wings are thick, i said i was gonna make it longer so it appears thinner, also thx for showing the blueprints
