the-dump 2023-01-06 16:26:16 the tech tree sucks
the-dump 2023-01-06 16:26:26 but who cares when you can enjoy pvp
the-dump 2023-01-06 16:26:54 o yeah i forgot skill issue and the fact that the game requires superpowers to be played perfectly
the-dump 2023-01-06 16:27:11 but arcade gamemodes exists anyway

the-dump 2023-01-06 16:32:44 or what is even a "healthy addiction"
