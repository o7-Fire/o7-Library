creations-chat 2022-02-27 20:42:33 anyone got any ideas for how to make my bad sr-17 look better?
creations-chat 2022-02-27 20:45:29 ok firstly its called blackbird for a reason why would i make the paint lighter, idk how to make nose better if ur gonna criticise me make it constructive feedback at least and i need the motorlock because the turning circle is like 300 miles across without it
creations-chat 2022-02-27 20:48:01 chill man i am just expressing my thoughts on his feedback and explaining to him that if i ask him how to make it better then he should not tell me to make it better, he should tell me HOW to
creations-chat 2022-02-27 20:52:33 im not asking for a tutorial, i am asking him not to tell me what i already know. I already know that it is bad, i can see that from the downvotes in <#384025409945337856> , but i am asking for specific areas he thinks it is bad not to repeat what i know already
creations-chat 2022-02-27 20:58:19 but you downvoted??
