Months of sleepless nights, months of endless studying and revision. As I recounted what I have learnt through medical school, i was greeted by a man dressed in a thick coat, holding a clipboard. 

“Index number, name?”

“24601, Johnny”

“Alright. Go straight a head, take a turn, go up the elevator and you can see room 102”

I nodded and went up. I felt nauseas as I followed his instructions. 

Room 102. That’s it. Taking a deep breath, I knocked the door and opened it. A lady allowed me into the room. As I stared at my 3 other friends sitting by the table, I followed suit.

Soon enough, the examination started. As the rules were being read out, I fiddled uncomfortably. Finally, the countdown began. Palms sweaty, we stood up and surrounded the surgery table. A single grape laid in the middle. A simple grape that will define my career.
