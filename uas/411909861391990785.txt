creations-chat 2020-12-25 22:02:22 yeah noticed that (if you downvoted please feedback at least, just makes you seem like you are downvoting because yes)
creations-chat 2020-12-25 22:05:20 The people are just downvoting because yes, out from the 6 people that downvoted didn't leave feedback, im retrieving the Tsar Tank from the channel
creations-chat 2020-12-25 22:08:15 Breh people are downvoting my removed tsar tank even though there is from little to no footage of it irl, there are only 2 showcases in video and no tutorials, and even downvote without feedback, totally not bots or angery people
creations-chat 2020-12-25 22:11:02 No, I'm not asking everyone to leave feedback, just out of all the people downvoted not even 1 left feedback though I asked for it (Tbh I'm happy enough with the result of the build, just wanted to get some feedback and opinionns)
creations-chat 2020-12-25 22:14:09 Well, because I could and If I continued to ask for feedback, of course I'm getting downvote-bombed for no reason because thats how this community works
