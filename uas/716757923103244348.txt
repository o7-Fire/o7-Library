creations-chat 2020-06-25 05:26:53 Question, how do you upload images to the creations channel
creations-chat 2020-06-25 05:27:38 Oh
creations-chat 2020-07-03 19:21:38 Quick question is a pentagram (the five pointed star) against the rules to build? (ping me)
creations-chat 2020-07-03 19:26:21 Oh ok thanks,
creations-chat 2020-08-12 20:30:41 Yea
creations-chat 2020-08-12 20:30:42 its layered
creations-chat 2020-08-12 20:31:01 Its layered not photoshopped if you want i can show you it before it deploys
creations-chat 2020-08-12 20:31:06 No its a motor that rotates it
creations-chat 2020-08-12 20:31:13 the outerlines are rotated
creations-chat 2020-08-12 20:31:20 One sec
creations-chat 2020-08-12 20:31:54 
creations-chat 2020-08-12 20:32:06 it just has a really forced perspective
creations-chat 2020-08-12 20:32:41 thanks, glad we could clear that up
creations-chat 2020-08-12 20:36:07 im taking susgestions what SCP related logo should I do next?
creations-chat 2020-08-12 20:40:03 Hammer down sounds like a fun challenge. Thank you for the susgestion
creations-chat 2020-08-13 18:24:55 In terms of the creations channel to upload creations is it against the rules to upload a image that shows how it works (For EX: a box that does multiple things and you wanna show the inside of the box)
creations-chat 2020-08-13 18:25:48 Ok.
creations-chat 2020-08-13 18:32:41 is that not allowed?
creations-chat 2020-08-13 18:32:46 if so my appologies

creations-chat 2020-10-15 17:26:45 Anyone know a way to have locked motors rotated when you launch it?(Locked motor gltich)
creations-chat 2020-10-15 17:30:51 I think it looks good but maybe a bit more detail especially at that scale
creations-chat 2020-10-15 17:33:13 Front loader (mostly because i've never heard of that until now)
creations-chat 2020-10-15 17:36:30 That'll probably look good but I don't build cars in plane crazy
creations-chat 2020-10-15 18:37:14 <@!407347404858458123> if you used back loading (Ik this against my statment earlier) you could use gravity to have the spheres pour out representing cement

creations-chat 2020-10-17 00:52:09 Thoughts or citizisims?
(I'm mostly curious why so many people disliked it)
creations-chat 2020-10-17 00:54:02 Nope No way I know of
creations-chat 2020-10-17 00:55:03 <@!515975379245203468> any ideas to improve the cockpit or no?
the-dump 2020-11-17 15:57:22 so myths are true about when you press that "shopping tab" of google

the-dump 2020-11-17 15:59:21 oh they will do some minecraft redstone so it arms and detonates when you open the door
creations-chat 2020-11-17 16:59:13 im not a ship builder but I recommend driving it around in PVP mode to find any parts that are unstable (to complicated and laggy) or find parts that could have been better designed by testing against players
creations-chat 2020-11-17 17:07:56 I feel like part of the reason for it getting downvoted  so much may have been the use of "not so complicated techniques" generally in my experience the more complicated the better votes it gets :/ or just how unique the mechnisim are <@!644377285746622494>

creations-chat 2021-08-05 18:10:16 How does this look for the jet turbine thingy on the alicorn sub from ace combat?
creations-chat 2021-08-05 18:14:02 other than the exposed motorlocc. i'd recommend trying to shove the tail fins further in because im pretty sure there isn't a gap between the engine and the tail
creations-chat 2021-08-05 18:16:53 there looks like there is a gap between the tail and the engine on where they connect. (the part past the motor towards the front) not the back part of the tail
creations-chat 2021-08-06 03:45:58 This runway is kinda bland and I've never really built a runway before. so any suggestions what to add? (the width is 5 blocks)
creations-chat 2021-08-09 01:40:10 This community does not like exposed motor lock.  However what about those motors that float off to the side for folding ships?

(I'm asking because I am debating weather or not I should rebuild about half of my boat just to fix this problem)

creations-chat 2021-08-11 05:41:09 Something looks off on the cockpit so far I can't tell what.
help 2021-08-11 05:41:57 Something looks a bit off on the cockpit I can't tell what
help 2021-08-11 05:46:43 ?
help 2021-08-11 05:46:53 Can you send a reference?
help 2021-08-11 06:00:04 Thanks
help 2021-08-11 17:59:42 1. Try placing the engines vertically instead of horizontally 

2. Sometimes motor 2s freeze up upon spawn so making the front spin will fix this
help 2021-08-11 17:59:54 From what I can tell there are no collision issues
help 2021-08-11 18:00:52 No? The base of the motor isn’t connected to the top
help 2021-08-11 18:03:57 Again you could try placing a motor then and make the thing spin try that ig
help 2021-08-11 18:04:50 No I meant instead of a half block place a motor facing towards the motor 2
help 2021-08-11 18:08:12 hey <@!717078710284714037> imma just join you and show you

creations-chat 2022-01-30 03:19:07 suggestions to make this interesting? as of right now the only remotely interesting thing about this is that it has locked motor with wing panels to make it an actual lifting body other than that its pretty stale.
help 2022-01-30 18:52:10 working on an X-02 the wing needs to be larger obviously but in terms of angles of the wing how is it?
