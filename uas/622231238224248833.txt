creations-chat 2019-11-04 13:17:56 I understood the mechanics of plane crazy when I first joined somehow
creations-chat 2019-11-04 13:18:43 That’s why I started to increase in skill so fast and now I’m actually trying to be a skilled builder for plane crazy
creations-chat 2019-11-04 19:10:07 What’s wrong with blocks?
creations-chat 2019-11-04 19:10:13 You use them to build
creations-chat 2019-11-04 19:11:07 Not really it kinda helps to increase the durability in PVP
creations-chat 2019-11-04 19:11:56 I make things for function personally
creations-chat 2019-11-04 19:12:15 It can look good as long as it works perfect
creations-chat 2019-11-04 19:12:36 Doesn’t that get tiring?
