bug-reports 2020-11-20 02:21:29 you gotta go into a new server, as the old ones are broken
bug-reports 2020-11-20 02:22:31 by my experience, some servers were broken and the one im in rn isnt
bug-reports 2021-01-15 00:55:28 i'm not sure if this is because of my potato or if its the game but...

a few hours ago, i was able to spawn in my 6200 block star cruiser easily with no issues, just like normal. however, all of the sudden i no longer can spawn it in as it now freezes roblox for 3+ minutes just to crash my game with this message shown below, so i cant use any of my builds that are above 5k blocks now :/
bug-reports 2021-01-15 00:56:42 ^and its not my internet connection because my ping is always at a solid 50-100 ms
bug-reports 2021-01-15 02:17:49 i meant solid as in average ping, but while spawned in it can reach 400
bug-reports 2021-02-05 23:43:34 whatever that new performance update was today is causing my roblox client to crash everytime i or someone else loads in a big build
bug-reports 2021-02-05 23:44:01 it happened like 2 weeks ago too with a performance update as well, but it was fixed after a few days
bug-reports 2021-02-05 23:44:16 and now its back again :painandsorrow:
