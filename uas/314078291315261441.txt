help 2021-11-07 21:12:08 how does one build a basic conveyor drive
help 2021-11-07 22:08:15 I have grappled with this thing for 3 days now
Okay, so - there's like an underslung tail-like structure on this thing, like a keel, except putting control surfaces on it really seemed to do jack shit for keeping this thing stable
Replace with a motor-driven control surface?
help 2021-11-07 22:08:46 (Also, the source design is supposed to be launched on a giant rocket booster, but fuck that I'm not making that thing)
help 2021-11-07 22:10:47 dammit
so the design wasn't possible after all
help 2021-11-07 22:14:13 hmmmmmmm
actually, I don't know if the rudder is the problem anymore
I had to use a really dense ballast block to get the thing to fly because it's so front-loaded and I couldn't fit enough helium
does distribution of mass affect turnrate?
help 2021-11-07 22:14:45 and apparently - testing it now - it *does* fly, just sluggishly
help 2021-11-07 22:15:07 tends to get stuck in turns
help 2021-11-07 22:18:40 lemme see
okay, so it *is* the rudder - getting rid of the ultradense ballast block at the back didn't make it turn any faster
guess I'll dismantle that and work on it
thanks
