<@!438492646311329794>
creations-chat 2020-10-03 00:12:45 so I have a quick question: do any of you guys still partly use mouse controls? I feel like it's good for when you don't want to full on into a a turn
creations-chat 2020-10-03 00:18:30 I use the mouse keys for stuff like ultra-sharp turns that I can't pull with the regular keys. I have also found that control surfaces seem to have a max turn radius when using a mouse
creations-chat 2020-10-03 00:30:26 > <@!672912304064430097> 
> I don't understand this .
<@!563462654090543114> I built this plane that on paper should have been highly manuverable and foundit to sluggish and I deciced to create airleons and elevators using the keyboard and it felt amazing! I didn't keybind all of the control surfaces so that I can just cruise and make slight adjustiments or full commit to a hard bank.
creations-chat 2020-10-03 00:36:30 this is my plane, it's a bit of flat boi and I like it that way

the-dump 2022-01-03 20:35:20 Anyone want a proof that infinity divided by infinity is infinity?
the-dump 2022-01-03 20:42:38 1. Create a set of all whole numbers from one to infinity
2. Create a set of all decimal numbers between 1 and 2. This set should include every number from 1 to ♾ in decimal form
3. Create a new decimal number by taking the first digit of the first number, the second digit of the second number, and so on until infinity 


You can repeat this process infinitely, resulting in the set of decimal numbers being infinitely times bigger than the set of real numbers. 
Which written another way is infinity/infinity=infinity
