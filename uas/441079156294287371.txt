help 2020-12-26 20:59:45 Why does the part count have anything to do with what rank one gets? Usually a bigger part count doesn't mean better, small builds can be extremely hard to make in comparison to a big one since there needs to be a ton of complex things crammed into something compact and dense whereas on a bigger build one doesn't have to worry about anything like this, also one can just make it extremely inefficient and use 1 x 1 blocks for the whole build and get a huge part count pretty easily. .  Sorry for writing a whole book about something silly, I just wonder why it's like this sometimes lol
help 2020-12-27 05:03:50 I see how in some cases more parts can mean more effort, although a lot of times it's not. For instance, a swashplate, a big swashplate is super easy compared to trying to make a very small one, or any huge mechanical thing made super small basically. And also the goal should be to have a lower part count just like map designers, when making a map blender is often used to keep part count and poly count low and still having the same if not way better quality results overall, a dev with the goal to have super high part counts is going to end up with an unplayable game. Also to an extent similar to irl, for example, technology, a smartphone is super small but very complicated and small, a smartphone the size of a football field would be silly (I kinda wanna see that now lol). I do see from what perspective you're coming from though. (why the hell did I just type something unreasonably long again xD)
