creations-chat 2020-09-28 22:41:55 ok so i figured out how to make a sled using nothing but magnets and it can go really fast but i dont know how i can use it in other creations
creations-chat 2020-09-28 22:42:44 ive tried putting wings but it got all quirky when i added control flaps
creations-chat 2020-09-28 22:46:52 also the magnet sled has no speed cap as far as ive observed
creations-chat 2020-09-28 22:47:10 this is as far as ive gotten so far
creations-chat 2020-09-28 22:54:24 you see ivan, when put tank in water, you get ultimate submarine fleet
