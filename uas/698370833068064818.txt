help 2021-06-30 06:34:11 depower a motor and turn on lock and put multiple motorlocked motors together to move and noclip blocks thru each other
bug-reports 2021-07-01 16:04:34 Not high enough level to post screenshot but I would still like to mention the issue of ghost blocks meaning invisible blocks with no hit boxes but you still canâ€™t place any new blocks inside of that spot
bug-reports 2021-07-01 16:09:54 Iâ€™ve tried that and they stay there and itâ€™s laggy to move my builds that reach up to 7 - 9 k blocks
bug-reports 2021-07-01 16:12:12 Iâ€™ve tried reloading the build but it only works half the time
help 2021-07-11 02:01:12 Either motor lock or lots of wedges
