help 2019-08-16 23:02:30 is there any way to make motors with 'reset' enabled stay in one place and not move around a lot when your creation moves
help 2019-08-16 23:06:46 that just makes it stop instead of going back to its starting position
help 2019-08-16 23:10:46 reset is supposed to make motors revert to their starting position, right?
help 2019-08-16 23:11:32 that is nullified by the fact that even the slightest movement makes it turn again, and then it doesn't go back for some reason
help 2019-08-16 23:12:19 no
help 2019-08-16 23:18:22 if i lock a motor then it stops moving whenever i let go of a key
help 2019-08-16 23:18:43 i want a motor that resets to its original position, but then stays in that position until i press another key
help 2019-08-16 23:18:58 if i lock a motor, it stops whenever i let go of a key instead of going back to its original position
help 2019-08-16 23:45:54 what do you mean by reset motors don't move
help 2019-08-17 00:11:39 if you move around a lot the forces cause motors set on reset to deviate from their original position
help 2019-08-17 00:12:21 and then they don't go back <@!343445507533832193>
help 2019-08-17 00:29:28 im not, but even if i was the motors should always return to their starting position instead of only after you are done using them
help 2019-08-18 01:58:55 why do motors set to 'reset' only go back to their starting position when you stop using them?
help 2019-08-18 02:00:56 but they move a lot and don't go back because of gyro forces
help 2019-08-18 03:23:45 Since a lot of people aren't understanding my 'reset' motor problem, probably because I am not good at explaining, here's a handy-dandy diagram courtesy of MSPaint.
help 2019-08-18 03:28:55 well just because something is some way doesn't mean it should be
help 2019-08-18 03:29:21 i think reset motors working like that makes very little sense, as if you want something to reset to a position, why would you not want it to then stay in that position?
help 2019-08-18 03:30:03 i agree with that statement
help 2019-08-18 03:30:24 yes
help 2019-08-18 03:30:39 indubitably
help 2019-08-18 03:31:26 ***look at the gosh darn diagram***
help 2019-08-18 03:33:09 reset motors working like they do currently makes things like custom steerable wheels unintuitive to make as any slight force pushes the wheel off to one side

bug-reports 2019-08-21 16:56:57 whenever you are going very fast in a direction, thrusters in that direction no longer produce thrust. thats probably on purpose, but it also means that any maneuvering thrusters also do not produce thrust, which is usually not a very good thing

help 2019-09-10 17:14:29 so how do them servos work
help 2019-09-10 17:39:21 doesnst servo just make it a regular motor set to reset?
bug-reports 2019-09-10 19:42:28 rickje plz
help 2019-09-10 19:52:27 in case anyone is coming here because motor 2 keeps resetting its max angle, a temporary solution until it is fixed is to set the motor's torque to the max angle that you want, and then save. if you load the save and then save again, it will break again, so you have to set the torque every time you save if you want to keep your max angle
bug-reports 2019-09-10 22:01:10 instead of fixing motors, our one and only god rickje made another motor which is also broken beyond use
bug-reports 2019-09-10 22:21:41 well one of the main features of the second motor, which is the ability to change the max angle, doesn't work at all
bug-reports 2019-09-10 22:21:58 id call that broken
bug-reports 2019-09-10 22:38:42 whenever you save and load a creation with the second motor in it, the motor's max angle is replaced with its torque, and its torque is set to 30

help 2019-09-23 18:48:01 do i need to land on a boat to get the 'just like elon' rank or can i land on the dock/ramp?
creations-chat 2019-09-23 20:23:08 I made a rocket that has fins that follow wherever your mouse is and keeps the engines pointed there, so you just point where you want to land and the rocket goes there. There is a small version of the mechanism (unstable) and a larger version (stable). The rocket also has a few other things like landing gear on both stages and secondary motors on the fins for control while flying (not for landing).
creations-chat 2019-09-23 20:23:50 Requesting 'Rocket Scientist [II]' and 'Inventor'.
creations-chat 2019-09-23 21:27:03 i dont understand why me asking for inventor is a bruh. the guided missile brickzay made worked by turning the entire backside of the missile, including the engines, and it also goes forward. mine turns the fins at the top individually and it goes backwards. i checked back since motor 2 was released, and i didn't see anyone that made individually turning fins, let alone put it on something going backwards (which is harder than expected because it also has to go forward at first)
creations-chat 2019-09-23 21:32:13 its a new mechanism never-before-seen. thats the definition of the inventor rank
creations-chat 2019-09-23 21:32:54 if thats not inventor worthy then maybe they should change the description of the rank
creations-chat 2019-09-23 21:36:56 it is very useful. it makes landing rockets incredibly easy
