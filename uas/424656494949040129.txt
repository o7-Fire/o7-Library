plane-crazy 2020-07-07 11:37:20 i keep seeing so many siren heads
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 18:10:21 I made a shark with a conveyor engine and it ended up as half submarine shark and half flying shark
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 19:40:06 thought water jet could have longer range but its pretty short
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 20:51:05 are u going to join multiple ships together or something?
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 20:17:35 **so we can make ww3 style plane crazy planes of course**
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 20:17:20 i *promise*
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 20:17:17 and i will make sure ww3 happens
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 20:17:12 just a future plane
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 20:11:16 WW3
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 20:03:11 third option probably makes most sense
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 20:03:01 some weird mutant alien bug?
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 20:02:48 a giant ant?
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 20:02:43 a grasshopper?
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 20:02:36 if i make shredder bug it would have to look like a bug
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 19:59:51 /e rich
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 19:59:36 no
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 19:59:06 like an oversized fat af folded shredder bug that just swallows random creations whole
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 19:58:48 maybe i should make king shredder bug or something
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 19:58:18 they are weak but there are many
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 19:58:12 shredder bugs are basically wildlife in plane crazy
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 19:57:45 someone thought my giant lava shark was godzilla and said that he could do a better godzilla
plane-crazy 2020-06-26 19:46:58 i want glue block
plane-crazy 2020-06-26 19:46:58 yes
plane-crazy 2020-06-26 18:37:51 pls someone build a giant spongebob and his jaw dislocates and eats stuff
plane-crazy 2020-06-26 17:12:29 that can eat boats
plane-crazy 2020-06-26 17:12:14 no its a slightly large goldfish
plane-crazy 2020-06-26 17:11:28 what if the shark is made of metal
plane-crazy 2020-06-26 17:10:18 does a giant shark count as a boat/submarine
plane-crazy 2020-06-26 13:15:48 breaking news: land shark gains ability to fly
plane-crazy 2020-06-26 12:05:36 yes
plane-crazy 2020-06-26 12:03:41 i forgot
plane-crazy 2020-06-26 12:03:37 what are the things that have the particle but it isnt smoke or sparkler
plane-crazy 2020-06-26 10:55:22 WHY DO I KEEP JOINING THE EXACT SAME PVP SERVER
plane-crazy 2020-06-26 10:46:23 shornk is now airborne
plane-crazy 2020-06-25 21:29:09 shark eat u
plane-crazy 2020-06-25 14:45:22 u turn the valve then keep pressing the lever thing until it flies through the window
plane-crazy 2020-06-25 14:40:07 how do u make this move without it diving with conveyor engine
plane-crazy 2020-06-25 11:50:29 im pretty sure the sea is too shallow for diving sadly
plane-crazy 2020-06-25 11:50:07 if u want the sub to go straight down, use ballasts, if you want it to "dive", use ballasts at either end and make them have reversed controls on each side so it faces down
plane-crazy 2020-06-24 21:48:23 you can change the control surface direction in settings
plane-crazy 2020-06-24 21:38:11 i will fix the tail fin later because to me it looks wack
plane-crazy 2020-06-24 21:35:42 mildly large fish jumping out of the sea
plane-crazy 2020-06-24 17:43:42 i once saved over a covenant supercruiser that took me a week to make and for some reason decided to leave
plane-crazy 2020-06-24 16:57:04 i should NOT have left that radioactive waste out
plane-crazy 2020-06-24 16:56:46 i took a break from plane crazy and when i come back to pvp the cutter cars have evolved in to flying cutter worms
plane-crazy 2020-06-24 16:41:49 üëÅÔ∏è
plane-crazy 2020-06-24 16:41:44 GRR
plane-crazy 2020-06-24 16:41:43 AHHH MY CAR
plane-crazy 2020-06-24 16:41:38 ONE OF U TOUCHED MY CAR
plane-crazy 2020-06-24 16:41:25 WHO TOUCHED MY CAR
plane-crazy 2020-06-24 16:32:34 has plane crazy 2 begun development yet
plane-crazy 2020-06-24 16:30:01 but yes its good
plane-crazy 2020-06-24 16:29:58 u should change some of the green to a different colour
plane-crazy 2020-06-24 16:29:13 i might just be seeing things though
plane-crazy 2020-06-24 16:29:08 i think zombie tower is uncopylocked now
plane-crazy 2020-06-24 16:28:00 just earlier i saw a swarm of flying sharks
plane-crazy 2020-06-24 16:27:43 it is really small but usually has so swarm of sea monsters in it
plane-crazy 2020-06-24 16:27:33 the oceans are a dangerous place
plane-crazy 2020-06-24 16:27:22 rip
plane-crazy 2020-06-24 16:26:22 lol
plane-crazy 2020-06-24 16:25:51 cutter worms are one of the weaker creatures
plane-crazy 2020-06-24 16:25:45 plane crazy is a hostile world
plane-crazy 2020-06-24 16:24:16 perfect
plane-crazy 2020-06-24 16:24:14 i added conveyor engines to my shark and now it flies
plane-crazy 2020-06-24 15:15:00 shark has grown fins now
plane-crazy 2020-06-24 14:13:22 use telekinesis
plane-crazy 2020-06-24 14:09:40 how come as soon as i load in a mildly large creation on a pvp server suddenly the entire server switches over to nuke cars and missile spam turrets?
plane-crazy 2020-06-23 20:30:19 how to finish a war: 
1)tell them that they are a bully
2)get sad that you got shot
plane-crazy 2020-06-23 17:39:51 
plane-crazy 2020-06-23 17:39:45 
plane-crazy 2020-06-23 17:39:38 start of alien shark thing
plane-crazy 2020-06-22 18:12:09 oh
plane-crazy 2020-06-22 18:12:05 did they add it recently?
plane-crazy 2020-06-22 18:12:02 i remember not being able to so i suggested
plane-crazy 2020-06-22 18:11:54 oh
plane-crazy 2020-05-13 20:51:17 hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
plane-crazy 2020-05-13 20:47:52 why do my builds have blocks missing
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 17:28:05 omg original 100% idea
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 17:24:26 1x2 pyramid wedge when
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 17:24:17 spike wedge when
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 17:23:54 it need long
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 17:23:22 chonk
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 14:59:47 looks like a really big boat
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 14:59:28 is that a boat
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 22:38:54 if your plane has a case of it report it immediately to your local plane doctor
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 22:38:37 aerial flu is very rare
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 22:38:33 yes
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 22:38:01 your plane has a rare case of aerial flu
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 18:53:30 i made a cafe in a spaceship
plane-crazy 2020-03-10 20:01:18 
plane-crazy 2020-02-28 23:52:49 i cant stop
plane-crazy 2020-02-28 23:52:47 is this a curse
plane-crazy 2020-02-28 23:52:41 now im reversing
plane-crazy 2020-02-28 23:52:31 i cant turn
plane-crazy 2020-02-28 23:45:20 wait does the speed matter
plane-crazy 2020-02-28 23:44:54 to me it does
plane-crazy 2020-02-28 23:44:48 my fps is really bad
plane-crazy 2020-02-28 23:44:25 because i cant go too fast with 4000 blocks or it counts as a lag machine
plane-crazy 2020-02-28 23:44:15 conveyor set to 40
plane-crazy 2020-02-28 23:42:59 guess im past max height already
plane-crazy 2020-02-28 23:40:49 bullets
plane-crazy 2020-02-28 23:40:47 im moving faster than my bulltes
plane-crazy 2020-02-28 23:40:06 
plane-crazy 2020-02-28 22:49:57 i probaly couldnt turn it though
plane-crazy 2020-02-28 22:49:26 if lasers were added i would continue my covenant supercruiser on my alt that i havent worked on for a year
plane-crazy 2020-02-28 22:47:58 yeah
plane-crazy 2020-02-28 22:47:37 epic
plane-crazy 2020-02-28 22:47:20 i guess my spaceship cant turn now
plane-crazy 2020-02-28 22:47:08 ok so u definitely cant use conveyor engine for turning
plane-crazy 2020-02-28 22:46:07 yes
plane-crazy 2020-02-28 22:42:44 maybe it just too fast
plane-crazy 2020-02-28 22:42:16 i just found that out
plane-crazy 2020-02-28 22:42:07 warning:dont use conveyor engines for turning, they break your creation
plane-crazy 2020-02-28 22:39:30 not little stick
plane-crazy 2020-02-28 22:39:26 big lasers
plane-crazy 2020-02-28 22:39:20 i hope the lasers are thik
plane-crazy 2020-02-28 22:38:15 wait are there lasers
plane-crazy 2020-02-28 22:38:11 
plane-crazy 2020-02-28 22:27:29 actually thats not a bad idea
plane-crazy 2020-02-28 22:26:58 i fear use of conveyor engines for turning as well
plane-crazy 2020-02-28 22:26:27 it just kinda flys in a straight line and starts rolling
plane-crazy 2020-02-28 22:26:08 how do you easily control a 4000+block flying creation
plane-crazy 2020-02-28 20:59:48 thanks
plane-crazy 2020-02-28 20:59:45 ok
plane-crazy 2020-02-28 20:59:35 the motors dont hold
plane-crazy 2020-02-28 20:59:00 how do you stop folds from moving
plane-crazy 2020-02-28 20:41:06 i didnt turn off anchor
plane-crazy 2020-02-28 20:41:02 now i realize
plane-crazy 2020-02-28 20:40:58 /oh wait
plane-crazy 2020-02-28 20:40:27 what about conveyor engines
plane-crazy 2020-02-28 20:40:15 ok
plane-crazy 2020-02-28 20:39:45 how many magnet engines would you need to get 3000 blocks airborne?
plane-crazy 2020-02-22 20:47:09 destroying an enemy ship or something
