creations-chat 2023-07-14 03:31:12 did you really just ask why? isn’t it obvious? it’s Disrespectful for the people who fought for that flag. and it goes for all flags as well, even pride flags
creations-chat 2023-07-14 03:34:49 because, especially for the American flag, Millions have fought and have died for it and for the freedom we have today and by someone burning it disrespects the dead
creations-chat 2023-07-14 03:37:19 would it be disrespectful to burn the pride flag? if yes, it’s the same way with the American Flag
