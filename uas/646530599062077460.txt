the-dump 2022-04-02 22:58:20 he
the-dump 2022-04-23 19:51:34 I thought there was that whole speedrunning controversy?
the-dump 2022-04-23 19:54:26 The way I see it, a lot of things are good on their own (Examples: Undertale, Dream, etc.). The problem is the community that follows said topics.
the-dump 2022-04-23 19:55:46 Competitive games like that are prone to even worse communities
the-dump 2022-04-23 19:56:24 Because not only is there the content itself, there's the player vs player interactions (usually toxicity)
the-dump 2022-04-23 19:57:01 I dont play online lobbies because I suck at FPS games
the-dump 2022-04-23 19:58:03 There was this meme about how xbox changed its pfp to a pride thing and the caption was "Xbox celebrating its most used word"
the-dump 2022-04-23 20:01:24 Oh my goodness there was this meme where it was a furry saying "we have the right to identify as animals"
Then the bottom half was a hunter saying the same exact thing
the-dump 2022-04-23 20:04:03 i am going to restart the watermelon cult
the-dump 2022-04-23 20:04:38 there was a bread cult here?
