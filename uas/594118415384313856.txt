bug-reports 2022-06-28 07:05:19 Hi!
I didn't find my problem in <#498473314445033472> so I ask for help

**‚Ä¢ Video ‚Ä¢**

The motors are **vibrating **when a motor is link to another motor linked to a** too heavy a load**
    -> Simple motor has no problem moving the heavy load

*Is there a solution to resolve it?*
bug-reports 2022-06-28 07:17:44 Normal motor do the same
bug-reports 2022-06-28 07:52:42 Yes
It's vibrating, but less
bug-reports 2022-06-28 07:57:03 ‚ñ¨‚ñ¨

‚Ä¢ Normal motors ‚Ä¢
I'm not pressing any touch, It's moving on its own
bug-reports 2022-06-28 07:59:44 ‚ñ¨‚ñ¨

One motor isn't lagging, no matter the weight

bug-reports 2022-06-28 10:51:33 Not working
bug-reports 2022-06-28 10:51:53 In 0 gravity, the motor is still lagging
bug-reports 2022-06-28 10:52:13 > I think that the problem is that a motor is link to another motor...
bug-reports 2022-06-28 10:54:49 And?
bug-reports 2022-06-28 10:55:31 Well what is the solution then?
bug-reports 2022-06-28 10:57:05 ok, sad

bug-reports 2022-06-28 18:26:56 That was a good idea, It's working for my wheels, but with to many blocks, it doesn't work

I have a question about *Rank*
I have a build that is using 2 accounts.
Is it allowed to ask for the rank, with this type of build using an alt account ?
