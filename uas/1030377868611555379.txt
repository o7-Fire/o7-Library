bot-central 2023-05-11 13:00:24 but i am level three is there a button to send it in the chat box? or do i have to do something else?
creations-chat 2023-05-11 13:01:52 and i got a question, why do people not like exposed motorlock a lot?
creations-chat 2023-05-11 13:05:17 oh lol, mine has a shit ton of exposed motor lock because hiding it would add more weight and making it less effective in cobat
creations-chat 2023-05-11 13:07:33 "what?" - Tai Lung 2008

creations-chat 2023-05-14 11:42:30 
creations-chat 2023-05-14 11:44:37 guys should i make the canopy of the f14 square or should i just remove the lines altogether?
creations-chat 2023-05-14 11:46:40 should i remove these lines on the canopy or make the canopy square
creations-chat 2023-05-14 11:54:20 this one is about a year old and im just modifying it to fit lower discord standards
creations-chat 2023-05-14 11:56:42 now answer me, should i make the canopy a square one or just remove the lines?
creations-chat 2023-05-14 11:58:59 got it.
creations-chat 2023-05-14 12:02:27 is this better?
creations-chat 2023-05-14 12:04:37 i need it to grate cheese.
creations-chat 2023-05-14 12:06:56 also i have cheese grater wings so that they can glitch into the wing box
creations-chat 2023-05-14 12:09:08 thats why i need the cheese grater wings, the amount of space and motor lock hidden will disrupt the natural movement of the wings so moving up and down causes the wings to wiggle into the wing box deep enough that closing the trapdoor will fully sweep them to a decent degree
creations-chat 2023-05-14 12:55:58 i put too much liquid seasoning on my food......
creations-chat 2023-05-14 12:58:12 now my food kinda....

creations-chat 2023-05-20 12:22:25 guys i need help my F313 keeps rolling to one side (it's rather poorly made but that isnt an excuse for poor manueverability)
creations-chat 2023-05-20 12:56:18 ok ok fine it's absolute dogshit even by my standards but can you please tell me how to make it not fly like an out of control f117
creations-chat 2023-05-21 00:27:22 shitty ass f313 doing nothing but taxi tests as usual
creations-chat 2023-05-22 00:02:03 hey why do locked moving motors always glitch tf out?
creations-chat 2023-06-10 09:56:30 why do the locked moving motors always glitch out with a slight click and why is my despawn delayed when im using a 2k block build despite that problem never showing up with a 4k block one?
