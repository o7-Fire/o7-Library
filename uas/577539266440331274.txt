creations-chat 2021-04-30 05:59:09 People in this community just disgrace others builds and give no constructive feedback, All because there probably not the best at the game.
creations-chat 2021-04-30 06:01:32 No wonder people perfer AstroCraft.
creations-chat 2021-04-30 06:04:03 Only because its late, Its mostly at around 61, Also just DM me if you wanna know what it is.
creations-chat 2021-04-30 06:08:52 Your judging a game by players, Seriously, Atleast the building mechanics are more advanced and the building space is 10x larger, Way bigger place to move around, Multi building, Trading.
creations-chat 2021-04-30 06:10:54 Why don't you go try it then, Probably will quit like most PC players because its "Too Advanced"
creations-chat 2021-04-30 06:13:27 And why would you enjoy a game with alot of limited possibilities, F3X is simple to use.
creations-chat 2021-04-30 06:16:16 Most of the players tend to leave all because they don't even bother searching for what F3X is.
creations-chat 2021-04-30 06:18:34 You can make alot more advanced shapes with F3X
creations-chat 2021-04-30 06:22:02 Atleast all of the stuff in AC are detailed due to F3X, It takes no effort to learn Z to move J to spawn X to resize G to add decals/textures C to rotate U for lighting etc.
creations-chat 2021-04-30 06:27:46 I'll just go back to making custom interiors then, Atleast we can make our own chairs and tables unlike one game here.
creations-chat 2021-04-30 06:29:50 Here's a challenge then, Do this
creations-chat 2021-04-30 06:32:29 Well you didn't accept my challenge anyway.
creations-chat 2021-04-30 06:34:44 Back to the non toxic community that actually gives constructive feedback...
