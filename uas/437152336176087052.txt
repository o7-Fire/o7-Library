the-dump 2020-05-24 03:57:52 *le tale of how I destroyed an ultra toxic community of 10k people*
the-dump 2020-05-24 03:58:04 ( this story is COMPLETELY true tho )
the-dump 2020-05-24 03:58:55 in short : There's this application called sticknode that has a community around it, it's basically a ripoff of pivot and flash, then the boss in this community is the creator, ralph, and his co-creator ( or shall I say victim ) sean
the-dump 2020-05-24 03:59:13 I joined the community and basically it was a nuclear reactor
the-dump 2020-05-24 03:59:54 people be ultra rude and make a swear word olympic every time, and the creator is loke, cocaine chill all the time
the-dump 2020-05-24 04:00:22 everything was good for some days until I critique on someone's animation.
the-dump 2020-05-24 04:00:45 https://tenor.com/view/nuclear-catastrophic-disastrous-melt-down-gif-13918708
the-dump 2020-05-24 04:01:01 boom, community meltdown
the-dump 2020-05-24 04:01:20 they hated, they made memes about me, they cursed on me till I am dead
the-dump 2020-05-24 04:01:47 but I am like that one penny on the rail that wouldn't flatten no matter how many continental railway passes by
the-dump 2020-05-24 04:02:06 I fought back.
the-dump 2020-05-24 04:02:25 my efforts were futile since I got temp banned for all the wrong reason
the-dump 2020-05-24 04:03:09 after that temp ban I came back and I literally cursed on every user that wronged me and swore I would come back on this community, then I got perm ban.
the-dump 2020-05-24 04:03:30 since I am not an idiot I came back and used a deep web website hacker software
the-dump 2020-05-24 04:03:42 the community crumbled like this :
the-dump 2020-05-24 04:04:08 my friend.
the-dump 2020-05-24 04:04:32 10k people, deprived of their free trial of happiness

creations-chat 2020-08-26 08:03:55 <:Thinkje139:590548255927173201>
help 2020-08-26 11:39:38 generally, people would just add helium on the rotor head
help 2020-08-26 11:39:52 and a ballast on the center of mass
help 2020-08-26 11:40:17 and also, metal control surfaces on the tip of the rotor blades, makes your heli stable
help 2020-08-26 11:52:36 what
help 2020-08-26 11:52:41 well
help 2020-08-26 11:52:54 is your heli Coaxial or Non-Coaxial ?
help 2020-08-26 11:53:03 Coaxial = 2 layer of rotor
creations-chat 2020-08-26 11:53:38 Blackhawk but with B I G rotor blades
creations-chat 2020-08-26 11:53:47 it did provide more lift

the-dump 2020-08-26 11:54:29 not these memes
the-dump 2020-08-26 11:54:33 they're illegal here

help 2020-08-26 11:55:30 
help 2020-08-26 11:55:47 A chinook only needs 2 rotor blade
help 2020-08-26 11:55:54 that's why there is no tail rotor
help 2020-08-26 11:56:07 and it spins this way as shown as what is supposed to be a GIF
help 2020-08-26 11:56:13 so remove the coaxial rotors
help 2020-08-26 11:58:20 Your typical chinook
help 2020-08-26 11:58:23 flies perfectly
help 2020-08-26 11:58:33 pay attention to the angle of the blade
help 2020-08-26 11:59:06 
help 2020-08-26 11:59:07 here
help 2020-08-26 11:59:20 and the motors should be set the opposite of eachother
help 2020-08-26 11:59:40 so if a motor is RF, the other should be FR
creations-chat 2020-08-26 12:00:02 <@!451853936815636511> I see you're a man of culture aswell
creations-chat 2020-08-26 12:00:15 👍
help 2020-08-26 12:01:48 Reduce the Torque to 1
help 2020-08-26 12:02:11 the power is easily explained, since Torque is literally means " Strength of Rotation "
help 2020-08-26 12:02:28 based on weight ?
help 2020-08-26 12:02:29 bruh
help 2020-08-26 12:02:33 doesn't exist
help 2020-08-26 12:02:41 but yeah, you should add wings
help 2020-08-26 12:02:46 like in the real chinook
help 2020-08-26 12:03:43 it should.
help 2020-08-26 12:04:59 
help 2020-08-26 12:05:06 small ass wing
help 2020-08-26 12:05:15 but yeah, put the wings inside
help 2020-08-26 12:05:26 hol' up
help 2020-08-26 12:05:34 what in the hell do you thing you're doing
help 2020-08-26 12:06:06 when I said " at the tip of the rotor blade " I mean it
help 2020-08-26 12:06:10 put Diamond plate
help 2020-08-26 12:06:16 makes your helicopter more stable
help 2020-08-26 12:06:35 and the helium on top is cringe, most people hide it along with the motors
help 2020-08-26 12:07:04 Like so.
help 2020-08-26 12:07:43 most people also just put heavy ballast to the bottom and heliums on top of the helicopter for stability
help 2020-08-26 12:08:07 my blackhawk has NO heliums at all, so it works like a real helicopter, and it's hilariously hard to control
help 2020-08-26 12:08:49 uh
help 2020-08-26 12:09:03 you should fine tune it
help 2020-08-26 12:09:11 5 weight is recommended
help 2020-08-26 12:09:59 Since helicopter don't use Helium for stabilizer, I turned to real life and put upright rotor blades instead ( super useful for stable helicopter )
help 2020-08-26 12:10:50 it's called a " Swashplate "
help 2020-08-26 12:10:56 I put it so it's very pog champ
help 2020-08-26 12:11:06 and yes, what's a swashplate if it doesn't work ?
help 2020-08-26 12:11:14 it does actually work pretty well
help 2020-08-26 12:11:56 well, generally
help 2020-08-26 12:12:04 it's 1 torque and max speed
help 2020-08-26 12:12:14 or 20 speed
help 2020-08-26 12:12:45 Real helicopter has jet engine to push them foward
help 2020-08-26 12:12:59 
help 2020-08-26 12:13:11 those barrels that looks like a jet engine you see in helicopter
help 2020-08-26 12:13:17 they're not for boosting
help 2020-08-26 12:13:21 they're for moving it
help 2020-08-26 12:13:54 a swashplate does move the helicopter a bit, but generally, it's just for pitch control
help 2020-08-26 12:15:09 nuuu no downloads
help 2020-08-26 12:15:22 most people just use " Gyazo "
help 2020-08-26 12:15:35 I don't use it since i think it's not pogchamp
help 2020-08-26 12:17:29 you need to raise the torque of the 2 rotors
help 2020-08-26 12:18:16 nani
help 2020-08-26 12:18:27 it needs to spin like a windmill
help 2020-08-26 12:18:41 higher the torque = more glitchy it gets
help 2020-08-26 12:18:52 you wanna see what max torque does to a swashplate ?
help 2020-08-26 12:18:53 oh

help 2020-08-26 12:19:03 you pressed the wrong button
help 2020-08-26 12:19:11 maybe you pressed R and it goes downward
help 2020-08-26 12:19:15 press F maybe
help 2020-08-26 12:20:36 well, the control needs to be inverted for helis
help 2020-08-26 12:20:45 if a motor for a propeller is RF
help 2020-08-26 12:20:50 then the other should be FR

creations-chat 2020-09-20 05:07:17 Ironically, here is a strange thing :
creations-chat 2020-09-20 05:07:52 looks like I sucked his upvotes
creations-chat 2020-09-20 05:08:09 he got downvote and I got upvotes
creations-chat 2020-09-20 05:08:12 lol
creations-chat 2020-09-20 05:10:17 20 more upvote I woulda have submitted it for HoF, but there's not enough detail, plus the build itself was **extremely** glitchy
creations-chat 2020-09-20 05:10:24 
creations-chat 2020-09-20 05:10:48 
creations-chat 2020-09-20 05:12:11 HoF vote is extremely picky and hard ?
creations-chat 2020-09-20 05:12:20 *what did I expect ?*
creations-chat 2020-09-20 05:12:38 so, you mean, if you get downvote then no HoF
creations-chat 2020-09-20 05:12:47

creations-chat 2020-09-20 05:14:15 considering the amount of douche, welp, if I ever get a build to 60 uppies and submit it, I better have insane luck
creations-chat 2020-09-20 05:14:44 it does look semi-decent tho
creations-chat 2020-09-20 05:15:06 to be honest ( but no offence ) it looks plain and tasteless
creations-chat 2020-09-20 05:15:10 to me\
creations-chat 2020-09-20 05:15:53 well, lots of motor lock doesn't mean it's good
creations-chat 2020-09-20 05:16:01 in <#384025409945337856>
creations-chat 2020-09-20 05:16:16 you can see someone used extensive motor lock but his plane just looks a bit bad
creations-chat 2020-09-20 05:16:56 well, the problem is, we don't care about stats
creations-chat 2020-09-20 05:17:00 we only care about the looks

creations-chat 2020-09-26 00:22:39 but hof voting is SUPER picky, and I hate that.

bug-reports 2020-10-21 14:06:18 but this is really, REALLY annoying for me and I think it's a common bug, it's so common that I think it's an intentional easter egg made to troll the player
bug-reports 2020-10-21 14:07:33 basically, at totally random moments, your mouse cursor just locks itself and you can't even move it, in other applications other than roblox, it's fine and you can still move it ( hopefully )
bug-reports 2020-10-21 14:08:17 this happens most when I open up discord tab to see the chat or pressing shift a bit too much and it opens up the control key panels
bug-reports 2020-10-21 14:09:04 this is the only rational explaination I can cook up for it, if you open another tab whilst playing the game, the cursor just locks itself
bug-reports 2020-10-21 14:09:48 but I believe more that it's a totally random easter egg / bug that's made just to troll the player
bug-reports 2020-10-21 14:10:04 first time it happened I thought my mouse broke
bug-reports 2020-10-21 14:11:12 it happens at the seemingly most random moment when you're peacefully just playing the game
bug-reports 2020-10-21 14:12:07 just phoking fix it, it's just like the south park biker sound easter egg, scared the shit out of me the first time I heard it, I thought some virus infected my PC and did that or something

help 2020-11-09 13:05:03 motorlock wing panels together for the rotor blade for more lift
help 2020-11-09 13:05:50 add helium to the rotor's center ( or rotor mast, don't see why they call it the mast it doesn't look like a long stick in a pirate ship to me, it looks more like the center of the rotor )
help 2020-11-09 13:06:38 color the very tip of the rotor blades in diamond plates, it has more weight, rotor blade weight matters in some cases
help 2020-11-09 13:06:58 that's what im sayin' lol
help 2020-11-09 13:07:30 ya, they don't really teach you these
help 2020-11-09 13:08:17 materials actually do shit in the game contrary to popular beliefs ( other than people knowing that fabric has more friction )
help 2020-11-09 13:08:45 fabric and ice are the carbon fiber of the game, they're the lightest material
help 2020-11-09 13:09:40 metal and diamond plates are the material with more weights than any other fabrics ( which have no weight )
help 2020-11-09 13:10:11 but i don't see the point in using metal since diamond plate looks better and metal just shines a bit but ok
creations-chat 2020-11-09 13:14:35 most public server peeps doesn't take plane crazy as a game to build epic good-looking vehicle or to do black magic shit really, they really just mess around with all the items, that's why most build in public looks ass

<@!526713899958140928> that's called dissymmetry of lift from what I see, it's basically wind wanna do funny with the rotor spinning in one way, so now it kinda tilts the helicopter, one way to fix it is by ~~swashplate~~ having more control over your helicopter or by fine-tuning the weight, this effect also applies to the tail rotor, so putting it on the other side might help, otherwise add delta wing in the direction the rotor is spinning
help 2020-11-09 14:15:41 or it might just be u powering a motor
help 2020-11-09 14:16:01 for an ez non coax, you only need one unpowered motor and only rockets to drive the whole thing

help 2020-12-05 04:11:08 realistic steering eh'
help 2020-12-05 04:11:27 the motor2 is oober clan and will shake when you add a motor and a wheel
help 2020-12-05 04:11:36 for this, you need an anti-shake mechanism
help 2020-12-05 04:12:49 there is 2 options for anti-shake mechanism for realistic steering
help 2020-12-05 04:14:05 the rope option
help 2020-12-05 04:14:13 you put em in the part that turns the wheel
help 2020-12-05 04:14:24 you tighten them and they'll stop shaking immediatly
help 2020-12-05 04:14:30 the most efficient option but not really compact
help 2020-12-05 04:16:03 2nd option, suspension anti-shake
help 2020-12-05 04:16:12 suspension absorbs the shock of the shaking
help 2020-12-05 04:16:23 compact, decent but not as efficient as ropes
help 2020-12-05 04:16:28 ropes stops completely
