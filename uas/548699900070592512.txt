creations-chat 2021-05-10 15:27:40 The only lights I can add are on the eyes because the mech I'm doing only has them there and I'm going for accuracy
creations-chat 2021-05-10 17:14:17 Yeah
creations-chat 2021-05-16 21:53:49 agreed üëÜ
creations-chat 2021-05-16 21:59:51 I'ma need a link to the chats you're reading. Alright I can see how someone could misinterpret that.
creations-chat 2021-05-17 04:12:51 Ignore the exposed motorlock, but anything I could fix before I keep building?

creations-chat 2021-05-20 03:29:48 Anything I can fix before painting?
creations-chat 2021-05-20 03:32:55 Yeah but there's 2 reasons why I can't. 1. I wouldn't be able to keep the rims and 2. The front and back wheels on octane aren't the same size
creations-chat 2021-05-20 03:37:32 Alright I'll try fix that
creations-chat 2021-05-20 03:45:39 It does all aerial movements already I just didnt take a pic of it

creations-chat 2021-07-07 19:32:45 Is it always like this in here? jeez

creations-chat 2021-08-28 00:42:04 I mean it meets the requirements but idk how to get it into hof, oh I see now ty <@!707953054489509978>
creations-chat 2021-08-28 00:48:22 This is a older version doesn't look as good maybe cause of the paintjob, uhh how does camera locking work? 
https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/604768973531119621/842972812872253440/RobloxScreenShot20210514_213508108.png?width=1269&height=675
creations-chat 2021-08-28 00:50:56 I'll try though camera locking is foreign to me. That would helpful
creations-chat 2021-08-28 00:54:24 I could join a public server, since my vip ran out

oh idk if I have access to that
the-dump 2021-09-01 23:01:41 Yo thats crazy
the-dump 2021-09-01 23:01:52 Hey

creations-chat 2021-09-06 21:05:37 Nearly <:nooo:787097964946259978> (but thanks tho)
creations-chat 2021-09-11 17:31:01 This does not look good
creations-chat 2021-09-12 21:15:12 oh no
creations-chat 2021-09-12 21:17:29 <:OmegaTroll:626841385118597152>
creations-chat 2021-09-12 21:22:07 yeah
creations-chat 2021-09-28 20:59:37 f18 almost looks fake, good job üëç
creations-chat 2021-09-28 21:07:28 When I said fake I didn't mean it literally, but I guess it might be
creations-chat 2021-09-28 21:09:31 Holy shit
creations-chat 2021-10-02 23:08:53 That's awesome
creations-chat 2021-10-05 00:21:49 Thanks
creations-chat 2021-10-05 00:32:22 uh the only other thing I could add was flying because it cant walk due to motorlock

basically an action figure, idk how to fix it

good articulation though

<@!798957190399524865>  <:nooo:787097964946259978>
creations-chat 2021-10-05 00:35:01 All good it's understandable, I'll try working on it though
creations-chat 2021-10-05 00:37:24 This is a new foot for a more functional one, so maybe this might be a good chance to restart (and make it walk <:empty:794431705070174238> )
creations-chat 2021-10-05 00:40:37 <@!527653676022628353> Can I ask the reason for the downvote? So I can try make it better 

oh I see, what should I add? There's not much given to work with due to hip motorlock
creations-chat 2021-10-05 00:43:47 sounds difficult and would take a lot of testing but I can try with the new one

btw how do you make mechs walk I never learned
creations-chat 2021-10-05 12:36:31 Wait, do you get ranks instantly? I never put in a request
creations-chat 2021-10-05 12:38:40 Oh alright thank you
