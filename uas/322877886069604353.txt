contest-chat 2022-09-16 02:42:30 And it doesn‚Äôt apply specifically to aircraft per se but any generic ‚Äúattack‚Äù or ‚Äúassault‚Äù vehicle that ends up being  an mbt or something

creations-chat 2023-06-29 03:50:02 Fleet of retribution giving actual advice (previously thought impossible)
creations-chat 2023-06-29 18:03:12 ‚ÄúThis game with a more simple building system sucks because there are games with more complicated building systems‚Äù bruh
creations-chat 2023-06-29 18:06:34 If the level of enjoyment you are having is based on how other people think your builds look then you‚Äôre missing the point
creations-chat 2023-06-29 18:09:39 there‚Äôs nothing wrong with trying to squeeze the most out of the system. That‚Äôs what the challenge of the game is. No one is holding a gun to plane crazy players heads
creations-chat 2023-06-29 18:18:57 You‚Äôre the one acting like it‚Äôs fuckin life or death lol. If I wanted to do super realistic shit I‚Äôd go download blender. I like the building system of plane crazy and I think motorlocking and shit is fun. What‚Äôs wrong with that? That it takes longer? I‚Äôm not trying to convince you that plane crazy should be the game you enjoy, but it sounds like you‚Äôre trying to convince everyone else that they shouldn‚Äôt enjoy plane crazy
creations-chat 2023-06-29 18:24:00 Lmao mald
creations-chat 2023-06-29 18:26:44 You‚Äôre gonna act like a baboon then you get treated like one <:clueless:942802644043464734> no one gives a shit dude go somewhere else
creations-chat 2023-06-29 18:30:23 It‚Äôs funny because all you have to say is ‚Äúhey check out this game for those that don‚Äôt like plane crazy‚Äôs building system and want something new‚Äù instead of screaming like a child into a crowd of people who are effectively laughing at you
creations-chat 2023-06-29 18:37:07 You can easily convince people who want something new by not being an asshole. My previous point still makes perfect sense. In fact, you are discouraging people who might even want to check out the game that **are** content with plane crazy by basically telling them what they enjoy is actually shit. I‚Äôm not even trying to argue with you man this is just advice on how to get people to play

creations-chat 2023-06-29 23:35:45 he won‚Äôt warn him because he ‚Äúhasn‚Äôt posted any links‚Äù even though he‚Äôs stated multiple times he‚Äôs advertising
creations-chat 2023-06-29 23:37:50 He was doing the same thing for hours earlier and didn‚Äôt get warned so <:empty:794431705070174238>
creations-chat 2023-06-29 23:40:26 You‚Äôre such an idiot it‚Äôs almost mind boggling you can keep spewing this nonsense without realizing it. That is literally the definition of what you‚Äôve been doing no where does it say that you have to make money off it
creations-chat 2023-06-29 23:45:53 Whatever you want to call it advertising or promoting an idea it‚Äôs all the same as far as this server is concerned. I think you just like arguing with people lol because if not you would literally just tell people about your game and leave it at that
creations-chat 2023-06-29 23:48:07 What‚Äôs the plane
creations-chat 2023-06-29 23:50:14 What block are you using inside the wings? If you‚Äôre trying to curve them you‚Äôd be better of using a motor to rotate them
creations-chat 2023-06-29 23:52:18 Ah. Imo it looks a little funky. Also it‚Äôs kind of hard to tell from this angle but I would say they should be more swept back
creations-chat 2023-06-29 23:57:25 Actually yeah it looks good. I would try to fix the gaps in the wings if those are control surfaces
creations-chat 2023-06-29 23:59:41 Hall of fame isn‚Äôt great because they stopped taking submissions over a year ago and even then I don‚Äôt think they bothered to accept submissions but there are good builds
creations-chat 2023-06-30 00:03:18 At the end of the day his logic is ‚Äúsince you cant make ultra-realistic builds given the style of pc the game sucks everyone is crying I am a force of good in the land of the wicked go play my super epic game tailored towards a different style and audience but I am going to insist you guys all are mad because you like plane crazy‚Äù
creations-chat 2023-06-30 00:06:23 sword the type of guy to say that Indie games suck because they don‚Äôt have ray tracing ultra high 8k textures  and photorealistic graphics (it is a 8bit parkour game)
creations-chat 2023-06-30 00:08:26 So what you‚Äôre saying is that both games have different build styles and challenges and they shouldn‚Äôt be directly compared because they aren‚Äôt meant to be direct competitors ‚ùì
