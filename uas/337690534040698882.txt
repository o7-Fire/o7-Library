plane-crazy 2020-07-27 02:21:47 for now atleast
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 02:20:12 of the build*
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 02:20:02 so dual review?
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 02:19:44 hard to report bias as the mod would most likely have the upper hand
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 02:18:17 and if a mod has bias and doesn't like you for whatever reason?
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 01:57:40 ngl jazz thats a good idea
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 01:55:58 was there a reason?
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 01:55:50 that stinks
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 01:55:06 is !servers still broke or are the servers just no longer being run?
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 21:22:32 we're about to begin
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 21:22:23 <@!505835349889777685> yo you wanted me and mega to stream our mech fights right?
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 20:25:32 One sec gotta convert that to est
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 20:24:08 mega I can probably get home in another hour or so is this fine with you?
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 20:23:20 Deal
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 20:22:52 Ez clap
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 20:22:47 Bet
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 20:22:09 But if your going faster than like 700 sps I can see where it might look choppy
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 20:21:30 10f fps isn't bad if your moving at slow speeds
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 05:59:47 the secret ingredient is rockets and their placement
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 05:58:03 wdym needs more details?
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 05:55:13 shinx is pretty big
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 05:42:25 its custom
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 05:42:21 no not ajax
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 05:38:02 mini blue
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 03:28:58 ok makes sense
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 03:28:33 why would you want xbox?
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 03:28:26 its a nightmare to play on mobile already
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 03:23:14 yea
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 03:17:46 are the vip servers down?
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 01:57:41 alright
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 01:57:03 on a scale of 1-10 how hard would you guys say a reloadable grapple hook is to build?
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 02:19:18 oh
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 02:18:30 <@!457390993025662987> i can't tell if your making fun of the misspelling of my name or actually trying to get my attention
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 02:16:02 shadow if your reading this hows it feel not being gay?
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 02:14:14 i see
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 02:13:50 did shadow decide to quit being a mod?
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 01:36:49 no
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 16:14:37 ngl the fact trails came before more wedges burns a little
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 16:13:36 not always enough room for a motor lock and no i won't just scale up
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 16:12:30 when? 😩
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 05:29:31 lol
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 18:21:52 the size of one of the biggest mechs in plane crazy in comparison to a person in vr
plane-crazy 2020-07-07 22:07:57 yep
plane-crazy 2020-07-07 16:09:43 anywhere you wouldn't be comfotable living as a normal citizen
plane-crazy 2020-07-07 16:08:27 rip
plane-crazy 2020-07-05 16:32:19 ***GASP***
plane-crazy 2020-07-05 16:31:54 where eagle?
plane-crazy 2020-07-05 16:26:42 oh 😭
plane-crazy 2020-07-05 16:26:22 <@!448505589983739914>  how do you have outlines?
plane-crazy 2020-07-05 16:26:10 how's maple got outlines?

plane-crazy 2020-07-01 20:13:56 Okay I gotta get back to work, talk later
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 20:09:47 That's only 70 not old enough
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 20:08:57 They're over 80 year old designs
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 20:08:41 Bruh
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 20:08:09 Sorry forgot the 17 was gay
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 20:07:39 
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 20:06:27 Design*
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 20:06:09 B-17, 24, 25 as far as I know have that deaifn
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 20:04:24 B-52?
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 20:03:26 Na you were right they are anti fun
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 20:01:16 Bruh cutters can't cut tnt????
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 19:59:47 Takes forever to cut a 1x7
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 19:59:12 They really are
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 19:58:30 Yep
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 19:58:02 As someone who makes combat mechs that use cutters to fight, I cry a little bit everytime someone suggests nerf cutters so they don't work after 10 hits
plane-crazy 2020-06-25 02:29:42 smh wheres the RGB "serious gamer"
plane-crazy 2020-06-25 02:14:34 if ya got 100 subscribers (i think don't quote me on that) ask a mod for community contributor rank i think its called and you can post your vid in <#537387160261885962>
plane-crazy 2020-06-25 02:10:21 *banned for advertising*
plane-crazy 2020-06-24 21:31:11 indeed, but alas it won't happen in our life time
plane-crazy 2020-06-24 21:21:58 cause if so its going on my bucket list of things to buy
plane-crazy 2020-06-24 21:20:30 are there water cooled rgb headphones out there?
plane-crazy 2020-06-24 02:22:28 np
plane-crazy 2020-06-24 02:22:14 then its not too far forward
plane-crazy 2020-06-24 02:22:01 galactic its not bad but maybe you could reverse the way the bridge is facing?
plane-crazy 2020-06-24 02:20:54 mmmm just hit my funni bone
plane-crazy 2020-06-24 02:20:38 on my pc
plane-crazy 2020-06-24 02:20:34 and yet im on the verge of crashing when a friend loads a 10k mech
plane-crazy 2020-06-24 02:20:11 honestly amazing
plane-crazy 2020-06-24 02:20:06 thats
plane-crazy 2020-06-24 02:19:01 snow thruster isn't powerful enough to move a carrier but on creations >600 parts it would work well
plane-crazy 2020-06-24 02:17:43 wing panels on motor2
plane-crazy 2020-06-24 02:17:29 in 0 g that is
plane-crazy 2020-06-24 02:17:22 without proper controls your not going far
plane-crazy 2020-06-24 02:17:07 but
plane-crazy 2020-06-24 02:16:38 its to my understanding that gravity works in pvp just as it would in regular servers and vip
plane-crazy 2020-06-24 01:51:02 open heart surgery on a mech
plane-crazy 2020-06-24 01:11:41 what does water jet do?
plane-crazy 2020-06-23 05:22:57 particles*
plane-crazy 2020-06-23 05:22:53 turn off particels
plane-crazy 2020-06-23 04:58:48 too many fail points
plane-crazy 2020-06-23 04:58:32 no
plane-crazy 2020-06-23 04:57:26 even after all i try i can't break 510 sps
plane-crazy 2020-06-21 21:29:31 many might not but it'd be quite useful in mech combat
plane-crazy 2020-06-21 21:28:46 oh man im gonna love this water jet
plane-crazy 2020-06-21 21:28:24 wait they push creations?
plane-crazy 2020-06-21 21:26:56 wasn't really expecting it
plane-crazy 2020-06-21 21:26:40 ngl i like the way you get water jet
plane-crazy 2020-06-21 21:10:23 big oops

plane-crazy 2020-06-18 22:27:53 wait
plane-crazy 2020-06-18 22:26:43 they literally just float

plane-crazy 2020-06-18 22:25:30 do people not know what a spring does?
plane-crazy 2020-06-18 22:23:24 tnt armor as far as i know only works against guns
plane-crazy 2020-06-18 22:22:39 cause its done on mechs all the time
plane-crazy 2020-06-18 22:22:03 is it really not known?
plane-crazy 2020-06-18 22:21:45 i haven't seen any community do it other than the mech community
plane-crazy 2020-06-18 22:20:51 you'll realize cutters don't do damage to each other they just turn invisible, make armor out of them
plane-crazy 2020-06-18 22:20:23 if your smart enough
plane-crazy 2020-06-18 22:20:19 also i just wanna point out
plane-crazy 2020-06-18 22:18:50 how to make the mech community cry
plane-crazy 2020-06-18 18:22:56 :/ went to dev tab hoping for some new hint or something only to get a poll
plane-crazy 2020-06-18 03:33:57 are there any plans for part collision damage?
plane-crazy 2020-06-18 03:30:28 followed by multiple discord pings

plane-crazy 2020-05-09 17:38:10 mmmmm i hope theres a range for how far away something has to be for noclip to take effect
plane-crazy 2020-05-09 17:36:38 wasn't what she suggested like give everyones vehicles like noclip?
plane-crazy 2020-05-09 17:35:21 rick if your looking here gib answers

plane-crazy 2020-05-09 01:21:27 mmm if they do make that plane i hope it doesn't have those ugly front pitch wings (i forget what the word for them is)
plane-crazy 2020-05-09 01:17:23 is it based on anything?
plane-crazy 2020-05-08 23:44:50 Man if you think about it your average plane travels ~400 sps your only going 5% the speed of sound
plane-crazy 2020-05-08 02:39:01 Oh well it's good anyways
plane-crazy 2020-05-08 02:38:35 Although hood could use a little more angle I think
plane-crazy 2020-05-08 02:38:06 Nice
plane-crazy 2020-05-08 02:36:35 Ah I love finishing something then my wifi drops as soon as I do
plane-crazy 2020-05-07 19:55:39 on an f-14 is where
plane-crazy 2020-05-07 19:55:27 😐
plane-crazy 2020-05-07 19:55:14 not bad just out of place
plane-crazy 2020-05-07 19:54:47 no, a more fitting place for it would be on a f-14 which is like the navy's counterpart to the f-15
plane-crazy 2020-05-07 17:43:50 i want to be able to have a max length that it won't stretch past
plane-crazy 2020-05-07 17:43:21 alright seems i wasn't clear by what i meant control length
plane-crazy 2020-05-07 17:42:32 <@!195253906333368320> where do you see option for controlling length?
plane-crazy 2020-05-07 03:01:25 no its not real if your wondering i just snipped the mod tag from shadow and put it on your thing
plane-crazy 2020-05-07 02:27:04 (((i wish i was fast enough to edit when things are still revelent)))

plane-crazy 2020-05-06 19:02:01 <@!429379150185234442> for those size legs i think 1 super thruster should do
plane-crazy 2020-05-06 18:32:49 and make sure its on/off
plane-crazy 2020-05-06 18:32:31 set the thrusters to the same keybind as the keybind used to make the legs bend
plane-crazy 2020-05-06 18:32:10 nonsense
plane-crazy 2020-05-06 18:31:26 and make the bottom of the feet fabric
plane-crazy 2020-05-06 18:31:12 lift the legs with thrusters
plane-crazy 2020-05-06 18:27:17 ngl thats a good bubbleship
plane-crazy 2020-05-06 18:21:39 oblivion
plane-crazy 2020-05-06 18:21:22 <@!435946988559925248> do this

plane-crazy 2020-05-02 00:26:55 <@!238017332872478720> quick question do i need a lead/lag hinge on swashplates?
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 21:47:06 y'all should fill up this chat so fry has 2 unread pings and has to scroll up indefinetly
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 21:45:31 <@!317063655520993280>
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 21:45:06 look up fry
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 20:46:57 hows this look for a heat wave?
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 19:09:15 he's got one
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 19:08:23 <@!317063655520993280> looks like a job for you
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 19:05:49 yea i'd say make it
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 19:05:23 lol
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 19:04:55 only if you can also make it do the stuff it does in the movies
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 19:01:54 (reposted cause can't see the conversion) y'all that say your going mach speed are down right wrong
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 15:59:13 but atm i can't test cause school work
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 15:58:44 im making a mech head and i want it to follow the mouse
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 15:58:31 no
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 15:58:09 servo makes it not mouse followed
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 15:57:12 do large creations (+1k blocks) still explode when you put a motor 2 on them that doesn't have servo on?
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 12:25:26 Super useful stuff
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 12:25:05 And allow for collisions between blocks
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 12:24:19 Yes essentially the pull a block half a block toward them

plane-crazy 2020-04-29 00:42:21 im so mad rn, the swashplate i've been making wasn't handling collective pitch control so i spent like 3 hours trying to fix it trying all sorts of different ways and finally i decide on a whim to add another motor the each control rod
plane-crazy 2020-04-28 19:55:26 lol thanks
plane-crazy 2020-04-28 19:49:58 whats the most upvoted creation?

plane-crazy 2020-04-22 18:40:30 hinges would be nice
plane-crazy 2020-04-22 18:38:25 from my experience you'll have better luck asking sakura for help
plane-crazy 2020-04-22 18:34:37 by my count 17-19
plane-crazy 2020-04-22 18:31:40 no
plane-crazy 2020-04-22 18:29:25 smh people this is already possible
plane-crazy 2020-04-22 00:37:47 hmmm im torn between asking for help on balancing my heli or figuring it out myself
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 23:59:47 i've finally made a working swashplate
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 20:38:22 im confused by what rick said in dev, is the new save/load upgrade deleting blocks?
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 02:57:59 ngl that suggestion about heat haze would be pretty cool
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 22:27:53 well i look forward to getting a new map in 50 years
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 22:23:43 bruh when is rick gonna give henkku rail sample so we can get new map?
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 00:15:09 the boomer mobile
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 19:00:02 shame on them i guess
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 18:59:34 convincing*
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 18:59:23 your story wasn't very convining
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 18:58:48 <@!287459677611098114> i didn't think you were new even once, your bad at trolling
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 04:20:14 big F

plane-crazy 2020-04-18 04:19:38 
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 04:16:13 it doesn't say a number
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 04:15:19 and admins are big maybe too
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 04:15:09 definatly not dev
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 04:15:03 not dev
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 04:14:50 probably a mod
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 04:14:42 get 40 upvotes
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 04:14:31 don't low ball yourself
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 04:14:20 and get designer V
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 04:14:14 you could get into hall of fame
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 04:14:07 bruh
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 04:12:26 its a wip

plane-crazy 2020-04-18 04:08:50 you did really good
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 04:08:23 is it your art shinx?
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 04:08:11 oooo idk who drew it but its really good

plane-crazy 2020-04-18 04:07:01 sure
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 04:06:44 ?
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 04:06:15 game over rick i win, your lack of wedges won't stop me
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 03:39:04 <:pain:644301805534183464>
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 03:38:19 bud*
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 03:38:14 2 steps ahead of ya bug
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 03:37:41 just when i thought i was ahead of the game in wedges it gives me gaps
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 02:13:07 eh never mind ill ask in help
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 01:15:48 go to <#537387160261885962> then search up folding i believe there a tutorial on it there
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 01:12:48 those are like your life saver wedges
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 01:12:14 if your new go to wedge 2 and half blocks and everything that says wedge place it and remember what it looks like
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 00:53:58 yes
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 00:52:37 its this but imagen the white is the black color to the left
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 00:38:21 desperate times call for desperate measures
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 22:44:40 a 10 weight ballast spinning the opposite direction somewhere under the main blade might help
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 22:31:53 thats trippy
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 20:48:25 thats cursed
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 20:46:44 and here we are complaining that 1x4 is too steep
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 20:46:24 thats awful
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 20:45:36 just curious but how hard was building back in 2018?
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 01:11:28 Wdym? Corruption makes a killing
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 01:10:22 It should be a democratic process for what gets added and taken away
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 01:06:13 If I remember right even sea of theaves has a hard time with water clipping into the craft
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 01:05:18 Eh kinda hard to define what's inside and outside
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 01:03:30 Honestly I don't think even with custom water its possible
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 01:00:11 I wish more people understood that fact
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 00:58:21 I don't understand why people think it's possible to remove water from inside their creations, that's like asking to repeatedly add and remove terrain which I'm near 100% sure would get very laggy very quickly
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 17:25:46 If I've been bamboozled I just wanna say mods gay
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 17:24:15 <#621452102618578964>
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 17:23:28 Is it real or did Rick just change the name but not the game?
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 17:22:41 What's this thing about plane crazy 2?
plane-crazy 2020-04-14 17:12:49 well to those that tried to help thanks but i found a way
plane-crazy 2020-04-14 16:39:36 or atleast more than 4 blades
plane-crazy 2020-04-14 16:39:21 anybody got a tutorial for having like 6 tilted rotor blades?
plane-crazy 2020-04-14 02:01:44 that bridge looks sick

plane-crazy 2020-04-13 15:11:45 verb you should join frys discord server if your into mechs
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 11:08:09 he pours through it
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 10:58:13 after taking this pic i tripped though
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 10:57:55 i've finally beat my speed record of like 260
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 00:42:11 it'll work trust me
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 00:41:31 well keep watching
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 00:41:23 oh
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 00:40:00 lifting legs > forcing foot into ground for traction
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 00:39:07 its the thrusters
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 00:39:01 its not the motor placement and fabric you should pay attention to
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 00:33:03 and it'll help you with making any sized mech
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 00:32:51 no
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 00:31:54 verbal watch Nicholas Y.'s bipedal mech tutorial it'll help ya make mechs if you still want a walking one
plane-crazy 2020-04-12 21:27:19 not quite flat
plane-crazy 2020-04-12 21:23:50 its not
plane-crazy 2020-04-12 21:23:19 doesn't say you can't use helium or ballasts
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 13:20:27 can't refuel cause of a small trench
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 12:52:30 sps is studs per second
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 03:30:36 or shot up 50 studs
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 03:30:18 i would be facing 90 degrees from my original direction
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 03:29:52 and the moment i stop moving the hammer
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 03:29:33 any force has an equal and opposite reaction
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 03:29:16 specifically
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 03:29:08 newtons laws of motion
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 03:28:39 the only problem would be
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 03:28:27 <@!437078588701933568> i've thought of putting what basically amounts to grabs ban hammer on my arm
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 03:02:04 hmmm
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 03:01:14 and the 1k could send the 5k flying
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 03:01:03 and a 1k block mech
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 03:00:56 there could be a 5k block mech
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 03:00:46 its kinda random
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 02:57:42 why?
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 02:57:31 only one goes flying back
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 02:57:19 but at other times
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 02:57:09 one mech will hit another and both will fly back
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 02:56:54 during a mech fight
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 02:56:49 so
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 02:56:43 ok i need science people to explain something to me
plane-crazy 2020-04-06 23:03:59 this feat of engineering so i could get my truck up here
plane-crazy 2020-04-06 23:03:27 with great amounts of patience they do
plane-crazy 2020-04-06 22:38:14 actually as long as my motors are able to pull a block in half a block idc what happens to them
plane-crazy 2020-04-06 22:36:59 fix motors then kick

plane-crazy 2020-04-04 00:02:40 which if we're getting new wedges that'd be cool
