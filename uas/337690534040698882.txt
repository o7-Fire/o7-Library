help 2019-11-05 21:16:37 are there any ways to make a fighter jet canopy that comes down over the pilots that doesn't lag the plane making it move slower?
help 2019-11-05 21:32:50 originally it came down like _\\|
help 2019-11-05 21:33:59 
help 2019-11-05 21:35:02 helps with hiding wings
help 2019-11-05 21:37:27 its based on a real plane how am i supposed redo the wing placement? either way not the problem
help 2019-11-05 21:39:42 
help 2019-11-05 21:39:52 
help 2019-11-05 21:40:09 i couldn't make it more proportional
help 2019-11-05 21:45:28 the nose isn't what im having a problem with. the problem lies in the canopy slowing the plane down considerably. this is the canopy when down
help 2019-11-05 21:49:25 in reality its moving more around 100
help 2019-11-05 22:27:35 i see, i thought it was because of a "foreign object" colliding with the main body that was slowing it down

creations-chat 2021-11-23 17:22:28 am i missing something about the kyle build like is it a satire of him being a hero or something? im genuinely confused why that has so many upvotes
creations-chat 2021-11-23 17:47:32 
creations-chat 2021-11-23 17:53:35 <@736201072938582066> would you answer my question I posted above?
creations-chat 2021-11-23 20:11:46 I've done my research and from what I can conclude he shouldn't have been there and shouldn't be considered a hero unless of course, yall have some ulterior more sinister motives? If yall wanna discuss further in dm's sure I'm open to having my mind changed
creations-chat 2021-11-23 20:19:16 idk this probably?
creations-chat 2021-11-23 20:26:49 its mind blowing im seeing it happen before my eyes
creations-chat 2021-11-23 20:31:07 agreed, exactly why the build shouldnt have been posted
creations-chat 2021-11-23 20:38:48 i asked yall to take this to my dms if you wanna discuss further please pay attention next time
creations-chat 2021-11-23 20:58:33 im not gonna say this anymore talk to me in my dms or shutup

events-chat 2022-01-18 23:15:34 Yep I was gaslight from my memories of cool moments during mech fights. I mean they're still cool to me just maybe not from an outsider's perspective

events-chat 2022-01-19 22:36:15 Pretty fast
events-chat 2022-01-19 22:37:07 Yep
events-chat 2022-01-19 22:38:48 No amount of cutting will break those legs

events-chat 2022-01-22 21:15:29 it is a grandpa mech but its how the best mechs (sorry not sorry rbk) work
events-chat 2022-01-22 21:16:09 besides creative freedom is the best part about making mechs
events-chat 2022-01-23 15:35:29 severe skill issue, most mechs are pressing 2 buttons back and forth to walk while sometimes adjusting the chest position/speed
events-chat 2022-01-23 15:36:00 hardly ever have to press more than 3 buttons at a time
events-chat 2022-01-23 16:05:17 yea thats about right, some mechs use up to 6 per arm but its not that bad if you know what your doing <:trollface:775024642104229898>
events-chat 2022-01-23 16:33:39 we dont do that in sbe üóø

events-chat 2022-01-30 23:17:24 im not a ww1 nerd so i dont know what theyre called
events-chat 2022-01-30 23:18:11 it could work if the bomber cant change course
events-chat 2022-01-30 23:18:50 helium and tnt
events-chat 2022-01-30 23:19:15 not if you balance it right
events-chat 2022-01-30 23:19:54 i think best option would be 1-2 helium blocks 1 tnt and 1 ballast
events-chat 2022-01-30 23:20:12 explosives are banned?

contest-chat 2022-06-24 09:41:23 it doesnt even specify you have to build mechs
contest-chat 2022-06-24 09:43:33 you could build this which is infinitely better than a triangle with a brick dangling off it
contest-chat 2022-06-24 09:46:17 titanfall brick better than space dorito
contest-chat 2022-06-24 09:48:02 man i wanna play tf2 campaign again

contest-chat 2022-06-24 11:50:17 The ship design in starwars is cringe (for the most part)
contest-chat 2022-06-24 11:51:36 Plus it's over done
contest-chat 2022-06-24 11:54:49 And finally titanfall is just the cooler galactic conflict

contest-chat 2022-06-24 19:33:26 Infinetely more based than anyone who voted starwars
contest-chat 2022-06-24 20:10:35 I only vaguely know what destiny is I'd hope its cool
contest-chat 2022-06-24 22:00:31 preach my brother, theres more to tf than just mechs
contest-chat 2022-06-24 22:01:23 
contest-chat 2022-06-24 22:01:50 some concept art in there but most does appear in game
