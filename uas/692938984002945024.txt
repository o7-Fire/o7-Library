creations-chat 2021-10-28 03:41:34 I don't even need feedbacks like yours. be polite
creations-chat 2021-10-28 03:44:24 It was intended. To make complex front part of t 90. Very disappointed to say like that as a feedback. or should i call it as a feedback too?
creations-chat 2021-10-28 03:48:28 Everyone has different standards. In my case, i like motorlock exposures. I would accept feedback gladly, but not like your feedbacks. Please please be kind and no toxic for feedbacks.
creations-chat 2021-10-28 03:50:30 I said everyone has different standards. Everyone has different point of views. It is rude of you to say feedback considering your standards only. If you hate motorlock exposures, pls give feedback kindly
creations-chat 2021-10-28 03:55:40 My plane crazy friends do expose motorlocks so.. I may be effected by them
