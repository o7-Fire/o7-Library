creations-chat 2022-04-19 09:26:31 guys how many people are toxic in this doscord server?


is that a lie?



how do you know for sure?



to my experience the people here can be annoying and (very) rude
creations-chat 2022-04-19 09:42:25 funny that people are nitpicking over every small detail, even if an atom is placed off by one pixel



also why theres a slow mode here ig
creations-chat 2022-04-19 09:44:19 btw what if you use disconnected disconnectors, that might make it even smaller : D
creations-chat 2022-04-19 09:47:08 wait why do you guys even care? it looks cool, and if you're proud of it, thats that, no need to be all nitpicky, thats just ruining this entire community pretty much
creations-chat 2022-04-19 09:53:07 do you realize that you are pretty much the cause of this 'bs'
