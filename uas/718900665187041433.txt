creations-chat 2023-05-20 09:13:07 maybe
it cant fly anymore because i tried making it mouse aimed but issues occured
mainly that when i unanchor a physics anchored block the part inside becomes too lose because everything else is heavier

creations-chat 2023-05-20 09:42:42 not sure how thats gonna fix anything since the main issue is that the part that makes everything mouse aimed is too light compared to the rest of the build so instead of the build rotating around that control point, the control point is the one that rotates, this doesnt happen when the control point is physics anchored though, but if its unanchored then i cant mouse aim it

creations-chat 2023-05-20 15:19:10 a cannon cart from Clash of Clans is turning out to be my most motorlocked build lmao
creations-chat 2023-05-20 15:24:50 its mainly just minor half position adjusments
like on the wheels and the ball wheels to imitate nails
im saying my most motorlocked build because i dont usually make motorlocks this much lol
creations-chat 2023-05-20 15:40:54 can try experimenting with trails in a bit yeah also i replaced the ball wheels with landing gears and it looks better
