creations-chat 2020-12-10 19:13:09 Yeah I have a few design ideas for that. The only problem I‚Äôm having is making it flush with the eagle‚Äôs back. I‚Äôll figure it out eventually
creations-chat 2020-12-10 20:30:47 It looks ok to me. It could use a lot more detail though.
creations-chat 2021-01-03 00:56:54 It looks nothing like aero‚Äôs venom actually. Not even the noses look the same. Btw aero is a good friend of mine and he‚Äôs seen my venom a lot.

bug-reports 2021-02-18 00:53:43 I don‚Äôt know why Luca is making such a big deal out of it
bug-reports 2021-02-18 00:54:06 It was and always will be an intended feature

bug-reports 2021-02-18 00:55:40 Luca is kind of an idiota

bug-reports 2021-02-18 00:56:53 How would you know
bug-reports 2021-02-18 00:57:00 Did you create the game?
bug-reports 2021-02-18 00:57:32 No comment lol
bug-reports 2021-02-18 00:57:39 He has no proof that it‚Äôs a bug
bug-reports 2021-02-18 00:57:56 How is it obvious lol
bug-reports 2021-02-18 00:58:03 Do you own a jet pack irl?
bug-reports 2021-02-18 00:58:24 And how could you know that it‚Äôs not supposed to do that
bug-reports 2021-02-18 00:58:31 Brug
bug-reports 2021-02-18 00:58:35 Weirdchampion

bug-reports 2021-02-18 00:59:36 I use it all the time and it doesn‚Äôt bother me at all
bug-reports 2021-02-18 00:59:45 It‚Äôs barely noticeable tbh
bug-reports 2021-02-18 01:00:01 And so what if you have to tap Q every once in a while
bug-reports 2021-02-18 01:00:07 It‚Äôs not that big of a deal
bug-reports 2021-02-18 01:00:34 It goes up at like an inch or 2 per hour
bug-reports 2021-02-18 01:00:53 Why are you asking me lol. Your the one making a huge deal out of it
bug-reports 2021-02-18 01:00:55 Not me
bug-reports 2021-02-18 01:01:40 I‚Äôm putting you in your place because the Miata guy couldn‚Äôt
bug-reports 2021-02-18 01:02:17 Have you looked at the game‚Äôs script?
bug-reports 2021-02-18 01:02:35 Yeah right lol
bug-reports 2021-02-18 01:02:46 That was a joke
bug-reports 2021-02-18 01:03:36 If you know rick can‚Äôt change it then why are you reporting it
bug-reports 2021-02-18 01:03:44 You also said it was rick‚Äôs fault
bug-reports 2021-02-18 01:03:59 ‚ÄúWhy does rick have to make life so hard‚Äù
bug-reports 2021-02-18 01:04:09 Not if it‚Äôs hard coded
bug-reports 2021-02-18 01:04:16 According to you
bug-reports 2021-02-18 01:04:39 Then he‚Äôd have to remake the game lol
bug-reports 2021-02-18 01:04:54 He can‚Äôt exactly do that without loosing the entire community
bug-reports 2021-02-18 01:05:07 How old are you btw
bug-reports 2021-02-18 01:05:38 I never said I did
bug-reports 2021-02-18 01:05:57 You kinda did smh
bug-reports 2021-02-18 01:07:18 So he could theoretically do that with the plot sizes and the map
bug-reports 2021-02-18 01:07:28 Because those are both hard coded as well
bug-reports 2021-02-18 01:07:39 No it wouldn‚Äôt
bug-reports 2021-02-18 01:08:12 Tbh I‚Äôm kinda leaning towards Luca‚Äôs side now
bug-reports 2021-02-18 01:08:34 You‚Äôre just being immature at this point lol

creations-chat 2022-02-20 06:30:26 literally a hunk of shit
creations-chat 2022-02-20 06:38:11 wow you're one of those kids lol
creations-chat 2022-02-20 06:40:31 check my <#384025409945337856> posts. btw, nothing he's made in this game has ever been good so it really doesn't matter if its a wip or not.
creations-chat 2022-02-20 06:45:04 ok you should see how much exposed lock is in EVERY ONE of doggo's builds. plus his proportions and scale is never right. thats one major thing i have that he doesn't.
creations-chat 2022-02-20 06:48:06 im looking at your builds rn and holy fuck you are literally PRE MOTORLOCK. theres no way you're trying to give me shit for my builds rn without knowing damn well you're even shittier than doggo. and <@!717225155029631057> exposed lock doesn't mean much when your build actually looks right. the only time it ever matters is if theres an excessive amount of it in stupid places.
creations-chat 2022-02-20 06:52:10 your most recent one was posted on january 21st of this year bro. thats not even counting the shitass wheelchair you made last week.  your dragster seems to be the only recent serious build. so don't give me that bullshit when i can literally see the dates on the posts.
creations-chat 2022-02-20 06:58:24 im not the one bitching about exposed lock. go talk to lucas.
creations-chat 2022-02-20 07:01:41 technically you need to go relearn how to read.  luca was the one bitching about me having pegs on my build and i was the one who said it didn't matter too much if the build was actually scale and proportional.
creations-chat 2022-02-20 07:04:31 the new one is still shit. it looks like fnonn's mirage. n64 game model
creations-chat 2022-02-20 07:06:50 im well aware of that. im saying the only thing its comparable to is fnonn's mirage.
creations-chat 2022-02-20 07:11:17 thats ass shit. and thats not even his mirage.
creations-chat 2022-02-20 07:15:16 i wouldn't be talking pre motorlocker.  and you're exactly right. im not hars and im glad. that guy is the biggest nitpicker in the entire community. nobody likes him.  and get the hell out of here with your broken ass english. you have NO room to be speaking in this argument.
creations-chat 2022-02-20 07:19:56 making a build that looks like it was made before motorlocking was even a thing

creations-chat 2022-02-21 01:52:52 literally eat shit hars.  everyone i know hates you. you're way over critical about every build posted. you downvote every post because of some dumbass pegs on a build. you're not even that good, you're just too full of yourself.
creations-chat 2022-02-21 02:00:35 ok well we have different povs on the subject so i wont go into it any further. theres no use in trying to change people's minds about someone when they haven't had the same experiences with them that you may have had.
creations-chat 2022-02-21 18:01:56 its a super hornet, not a legacy hornet.
