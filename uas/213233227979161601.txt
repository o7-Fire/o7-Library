creations-chat 2019-11-28 11:31:24 
creations-chat 2019-11-28 11:32:48 the crappiness of the second version made me build a third version of the Sukhoi Su34 Fullback, it now has 376 blocks, with moving ailerons/elevators *and* vector thrust, albeit with less weapons

creations-chat 2020-01-15 04:46:43 if you put a light block underneath it, it's sort of brighter but just by a bit

creations-chat 2020-03-05 13:03:12 <@!409676438682206218> the giant gap is for the rocket to be able to move around
creations-chat 2020-03-05 13:03:27 cus 3D thrust vector
creations-chat 2020-03-05 13:03:36 tho it doesn't work as well as my Su34 and Su37 build
creations-chat 2020-03-05 13:04:18 e
creations-chat 2020-03-05 13:05:05 never tried motor lock, but disconnector is no can do. it won't allow the rockets to move
creations-chat 2020-03-05 13:05:10 at least, that's when i last tried
creations-chat 2020-03-05 13:05:51 yeah i used it to move the wings upward
creations-chat 2020-03-05 13:06:32 i really don't mind teaching people, so long as i have the time
creations-chat 2020-03-05 13:07:06 ah, warbirds are not my expertise. i'm still learning that
creations-chat 2020-03-05 13:07:45 o o f
creations-chat 2020-03-13 06:47:47 pardon me for asking but what is it with people using "custom" for a vehicle that exists in the real world

creations-chat 2020-03-17 09:27:30 `there can only be one Mihaly`

Sukhoi Su-30SM in Ace Combat 7's Sol Squadron camo, 525 blocks

complete with the usual things in my Sukhoi builds and a few new ones:
- retracting landing gears
- 3D thrust vectoring
- operational ailerons, canards and elevators
- took it a step further and gave it operational rudders (which can act as airbrakes too)
- seating for 2 (enter from the bottom of fuselage)

things omitted from actual Su-30SM:
- dorsal airbrakes (it slows the plane down in flight)

creations-chat 2020-03-18 10:14:53 ok I feel like mihaly's livery is starting to be overdone
creations-chat 2020-03-18 10:15:09 also, that's not even mihaly
creations-chat 2020-03-18 10:15:15 mihaly's tail is orange
creations-chat 2020-03-18 10:15:32 so therefore it makes me the true Mihaly

creations-chat 2020-03-27 10:53:40 if he doesn't use a control surface, the ailerons won't function
creations-chat 2020-03-27 10:54:04 cus if he used panels, it will stick to the other wing panels
creations-chat 2020-03-28 15:22:46 ooooooo
creations-chat 2020-03-28 15:22:59 that looks simple but somewhat unique
creations-chat 2020-03-31 12:13:45 oh boi that's massive

creations-chat 2020-05-25 03:34:32 <@393679134779375616> I'd make the tail about 1 or two blocks longer. the distance between the end of the main wing and tail wing is a bit longer when I look at the blueprints
creations-chat 2020-05-25 03:34:46 but apart from that, in  terms of how it looks, it's really good!
creations-chat 2020-05-25 03:36:45 I'll be honest, I'm not sure what you're trying to go for <:GWjiangoOmegaLUL:389904150886088723>
creations-chat 2020-05-25 03:36:56 but it looks like a Typhoon?
creations-chat 2020-05-25 03:37:41 icic
creations-chat 2020-05-25 03:38:28 I'd make the vertical stabiliser bigger, it's absurdly disproportionate to the main wing imo
creations-chat 2020-05-25 03:38:39 at least from the camera angle you've given
creations-chat 2020-05-25 03:39:34 also, try to put the rear landing gears wider apart, you're going to have some slight instability issues if you plan to move the plane around on the ground
creations-chat 2020-05-25 03:39:44 > so make the rudder bigger?
yeah, essentially that
creations-chat 2020-05-25 03:40:16 np
creations-chat 2020-05-25 03:40:44 aye np
creations-chat 2020-05-25 05:30:47 ooo, that's really neat
creations-chat 2020-05-29 05:41:46 sad reality of the game, there's seldom a block for an inbetween

creations-chat 2020-06-02 09:05:28 for example, lag
creations-chat 2020-06-04 02:28:06 i think they meant this
creations-chat 2020-06-04 02:29:26 super simple
creations-chat 2020-06-04 02:29:46 just make sure the larger control surfaces dont touch the the mainwing other than the motor 2s
creations-chat 2020-06-04 03:49:01 you can always improve!

creations-chat 2020-06-04 14:09:23 i like the use of the hover thrusters <:pogey:651848693842182144>
help 2020-06-04 14:09:36 i think he meant the ballasts
help 2020-06-04 14:48:04 <@665957175515938837> whichever you're more comfortable with. however your plane will move more realistically if you use a keyboard with "custom" control surfaces
help 2020-06-04 14:48:23 i.e motor 2 controlled ailerons, flaps, rudder, elevators
creations-chat 2020-06-04 14:49:35 more people building Fullbacks, this is exactly what I want to see

help 2020-06-05 16:08:00 what are you using for propulsion? engines or rockets?
help 2020-06-05 16:08:53 conveyor engines are whack based on my own experience
help 2020-06-05 16:09:21 i guess a quick fix for the time beind is to somehow add more lift at the front

help 2020-06-05 16:10:50 replace the front of the intake with normal delta wing panels
help 2020-06-05 16:11:04 and try topracer's advice too
help 2020-06-05 16:13:15 you can make it more flush with the design, but otherwise, you've got the idea
help 2020-06-05 16:15:03 there's only one way to tell and that's to test it
help 2020-06-05 16:15:12 it wont eradicate the issue completely tho
help 2020-06-05 16:15:43 yeah i starting to think conveyor engines aren't too great for small builds <:Thonk:509498568982134816>
help 2020-06-05 16:16:35 highly recommend changing propulsion to the usual super rocket engines

help 2020-06-08 17:29:25 but you'd have to have a larger-than-life scale
help 2020-06-08 17:29:56 I don't remember how they did it, but it was a bunch of motor 2s and a few half wedges

creations-chat 2020-06-15 09:05:21 does the wing look too thin and/or long to you guys?
creations-chat 2020-06-15 09:05:29 
creations-chat 2020-06-15 15:40:39 nice
creations-chat 2020-06-15 15:41:07 looks a little stubby but not bad honestly
creations-chat 2020-06-16 01:01:23 yes, those wheels make it ook better
creations-chat 2020-06-16 01:01:39 body still needs a lot of work
creations-chat 2020-06-16 10:05:14 that 100% totally not stolen f-16 is too massive for my liking
creations-chat 2020-06-17 03:40:31 im getting 503
help 2020-06-17 04:54:39 most likely the torque from the propellor
help 2020-06-17 04:54:58 is there a way to counter it? not sure myself
help 2020-06-17 04:55:21 can you screenshot the whole build?
help 2020-06-17 04:56:26 im not sure if the problem still exists, but whenever i spawn in the airport and my build has the standard control surfaces, they will never respond accordingly
help 2020-06-17 04:57:03 if you've spawned from the airport, that *might* be the issue. otherwise, if it's design related, we'll have to see the whole build
help 2020-06-17 04:59:28 how about in build mode?
help 2020-06-17 04:59:37 and a little closer please
help 2020-06-17 05:05:22 <@!607098626153644032> check all your control surfaces and see if they're all set to automatic. that means it will follow your mouse
help 2020-06-17 05:05:54 otherwise, there's literally no other factors causing your plane to roll to the left other than the torque from your engine
help 2020-06-17 05:06:50 i also have this issue on my Zero but since i use keyboard controls and motor-powered control surfaces, it's easier to counter

help 2020-06-29 02:33:11 <@614759148952879114> TNT will explode if it hits anything and it's above speed 50
help 2020-06-29 02:34:06 so, if the TNT is set to explode at speed 50, but it is at speed 15 and hits something, it won't explode
help 2020-06-29 02:34:15 I don't think it'll explode mid air
help 2020-06-29 02:34:22 very likely
help 2020-06-29 02:34:41 I haven't made cannons like those tho, so I'm not too sure
help 2020-06-29 02:36:00 that could work, but that would also mean that you'll have to set seperate keybinds to every TNT ball

I'm looking, just figuring out how you could make it better
creations-chat 2020-09-21 04:08:54 - instead of having a flat body, give it some varying depth and volume. see the F-15 or the F-16
- instead of using 1x2/1x3 delta panels, use 1x1 delta panels. see the JAS-39 or the AJ-37 for reference

creations-chat 2021-07-12 05:51:45 I have a few things to say 

- the extended leading edge should be shifted a little further up the nose
- the elevators can probably be pushed back 1 or 2 blocks
- consider using large rockets/jet engines and motorlock it? (though given the scale i think it's fine as it is
- the shape of the elevators could be tweaked a bit, sweep it back maybe? 

other than that, i think it's a pretty good Super Hornet. kudos on the afterburner! 👌
