creations-chat 2021-05-10 23:40:12 i'm not done with this new glenn, but since im so skeptical if the physical looks are good or not, i wanted to ask you guys for a feedback
creations-chat 2021-05-11 00:52:20 quite the blocky
help 2021-05-11 01:36:08 hm
help 2021-05-11 01:36:36 what's the best method for detaching a fairing in half especially when i'm using a motor
help 2021-05-11 01:36:51 space is very limited bc this thing is about 370 studs tall
help 2021-05-11 02:00:34 I’m pretty sure that’s an issue with motor 2
help 2021-05-11 02:00:49 it hasn’t been fixed yet so that’s why I always use the original motor or servo
