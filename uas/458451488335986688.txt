And it flies comfortably slow for novice pilots

creations-chat 2018-11-05 05:21:28 i said STOP ALREADY
creations-chat 2018-11-05 05:22:27 like i said earlier, nobody is building properly and enjoying without understanding the game, NO MATTER WHAT GETS ADDED INTO IT
creations-chat 2018-11-05 05:23:22 nothing is gonna simplify anything except the player understanding how the game works.
creations-chat 2018-11-05 05:25:27 <@!314219571995344897> dude thats up to rick and Roblox itself to fix
creations-chat 2018-11-05 05:25:45 <@!286052871693139981> actually its in alpha
creations-chat 2018-11-05 05:27:27 man im gonna need alot of hardbass after this
creations-chat 2018-11-05 05:27:39 ^BOM
creations-chat 2018-11-05 05:28:02 nvm. gonna keep working on my C-130
creations-chat 2018-11-05 05:29:16 i have no experience with magnets
but imma pick the magnet
creations-chat 2018-11-05 05:29:35 but im not gonna make magnet creations anytime soon tho
creations-chat 2018-11-05 05:32:50 thinking abt it, 2 oppositely charged magnets wont do anything else but get attracted to each other
so they would behave like sticky blocks on contact
creations-chat 2018-11-05 05:36:10 i would experiment with either one
the 2 oppositely charged magnets would just behave like sticky blocks so no
regular magnets (which sound like they are actually electromagnets) would look versatile compared to the previous example so i would go for the regular magnets
creations-chat 2018-11-05 05:37:24 yep. the magnets really are electromagnets
creations-chat 2018-11-05 05:37:48 <@!314219571995344897>  do you know what an electromagnet even is lol
creations-chat 2018-11-05 05:38:42 yeah
creations-chat 2018-11-05 05:39:30 thats what i did 5 minutes into my first game session (first thing i did was fly around as a passenger in somebody elses plane)
creations-chat 2018-11-05 05:39:54 ^ how it is in real life
creations-chat 2018-11-05 05:40:22 electromagnet strength fluctuates alot
creations-chat 2018-11-05 05:40:49 lol
creations-chat 2018-11-05 05:41:45 <@!314219571995344897> i would still use it. albeit to reach 6860sps
creations-chat 2018-11-05 05:42:08 ^agreed
creations-chat 2018-11-05 05:43:12 *magnetic decouplers that can recouple at will*
creations-chat 2018-11-05 05:43:30 ik
creations-chat 2018-11-05 05:43:41 thats what i was telling dragon
creations-chat 2018-11-05 05:44:50 <@!314219571995344897> they would choose it all right
until they realize that those single polarity magnets only stick like moth memes to my facebook feed and do absolutely nothing else
creations-chat 2018-11-05 05:45:50 tied lol
creations-chat 2018-11-05 05:48:19 ^there is a reason why Phantom Forces doesnt remove guns from their main game
creations-chat 2018-11-05 05:48:38 massive data loss and game file corruption
creations-chat 2018-11-05 05:50:18 thats gonna be hard since there is only ONE dev acting on this game

creations-chat 2018-11-05 08:55:30 In this edition of boymahina123 builds
I create
The venerable Lockheed C-130!
creations-chat 2018-11-05 08:56:50 It flies pretty good for a large aircraft (not sure about it myself because my PC lags at around 800+ blocks)
creations-chat 2018-11-05 08:57:49 It also has fixed/extendable leading edge slots (pictured here in retracted position)
creations-chat 2018-11-05 08:58:33 Extendable slots (extended position)
creations-chat 2018-11-05 09:00:44 The conventional cargo version has room for a very small vehicle and/or seats for 20 people (not that there are 20 people ever in any server)
creations-chat 2018-11-05 09:02:39 And since i had modularity and easy conversions in mind when i built this wonderful aircraft, i have made many options.
Including the best version, the AC-130!
creations-chat 2018-11-05 09:03:38 It flies great and looks even greater (you can call it epic, even.)
creations-chat 2018-11-05 09:05:07 and all of that at just above 800 parts.

Please keep in mind to leave an upvote if you wanna see more of boymahina123 builds

Until next time, folks!

creations-chat 2018-11-06 04:59:51 Also there are rc planes that are bigger than fully grown adults.
creations-chat 2018-11-06 05:01:23 Some of them can qualify as microlight drones for children
bug-reports 2018-11-06 05:25:16 Does anyone notice any handling changes when comparing a plane as it was built as opposed to after it has been loaded in?
creations-chat 2018-11-06 06:07:56 Everytime i go to the arena and someones there. I shoot them but they keep flying even if i shoot all engines/wings off.
Makes me feel like arena guns are still clientsided even in the arena
creations-chat 2018-11-06 06:09:32 Great engineering doesnt explain how hes flying with just a beam and his seat left
creations-chat 2018-11-06 06:10:09 So it must be clientsided guns.
creations-chat 2018-11-06 06:13:39 Or it might be just me thats trapped at clientside

creations-chat 2018-11-06 08:29:41 On this edition of boymahina123 builds,
We journey to the twilight zone
In an F-117 Nighthawk.
creations-chat 2018-11-06 08:31:39 I have built it specifically for the rocket update with a bomb bay and extendable attachment point
(pictured here is the bomb bay closed)
creations-chat 2018-11-06 08:32:33 (picture of bomb bay opened and rocket attachment point extended)
creations-chat 2018-11-06 08:35:18 It handles relatively bad but thats expected of this pretty large aircraft
creations-chat 2018-11-06 08:38:13 I have seen this done once before but not like this.
creations-chat 2018-11-06 08:41:39 This build of 652 parts (not including armament) is one of, if not the quickest builds i have ever done and posted at just below 1hr 40min.

This has been boymahina123.
See ya next time.

bug-reports 2018-11-06 16:09:38 When i fly in my F-117 and i use the motors to do the accurate butterfly (V-shaped) tail the tail collapses at some point mid-flight, messes up my controls and sometimes the tail even glitches thru itself and locks in an awkward position destabilizing my aircraft.
Even with the lock setting on it keeps happening when i turn steep.
Pls fix

creations-chat 2018-11-06 16:49:07 Lol i use propeller engines when im having a hard time getting my creations to fly.
Added them to my C-130 to add lift and make it easier to control.
Added them to my F-117 Nighthawk because control surfaces arent enough to get the dang thing to pitch up
creations-chat 2018-11-06 16:49:58 Imma add them to my TB-3 to see if they would make handling any better.
creations-chat 2018-11-06 16:50:48 <@227590705286086659> first i gotta figure out how to get my C-130 to 500+sps
creations-chat 2018-11-06 16:52:15 It is but i havent got time to tinker with magnets.
Also i hid lots of propeller engines for sound
creations-chat 2018-11-06 16:53:24 
creations-chat 2018-11-06 16:53:56 Much of its volume is cargo space lol
creations-chat 2018-11-06 16:54:53 Try to fly both of them at 500+sps
Then look for handling changes

creations-chat 2018-11-07 11:58:22 In this edition of boymahina123 builds
I make the past's vision of the future (and hopefully get Inventor and Modeller)
In the form of my M3077 "Magnus" Flettner Airliner.
creations-chat 2018-11-07 12:00:38 It uses the "revolutionary" Flettner rotor which makes use of the Magnus effect to boost lift and performance.
The real designs never went beyond concept because of mechanical complexity but it it complexity that dives Plane Crazy.
creations-chat 2018-11-07 12:02:33 It flies like a dream. It turns effortlessly, flies at relatively high speeds for a big plane and can land slowly and softly.
creations-chat 2018-11-07 12:04:15 It is also adaptable to a certain degree (seen here with winter skids for unprepared winter landing strips)
creations-chat 2018-11-07 12:09:27 It has 660 parts, 8 passenger seats (expandable to 10) and 4 crew.

creations-chat 2018-11-11 07:22:51 In todays editon of boymahina123 builds
we build an example of Supreme German Engineering
The Dornier Do 31.
creations-chat 2018-11-11 07:24:40 and lo and behold
creations-chat 2018-11-11 07:27:25 It is a fully functioning replica of the Dornier Do 31 in Plane Crazy.
Full STOVL functions, Good sized cargo bay, Glass cockpit (this is a pun that i will arrive to soon), and all bells and whistles.
creations-chat 2018-11-11 07:29:07 It can take off and land vertically and horizontally. Vertical-Horizontal flight transitions are smooth. Maneuverable both in vertical and horizontal flight.
creations-chat 2018-11-11 07:31:08 And it literally has a glass cockpit!
*ba dum tss*

Great visibility from inside the cockpit.
creations-chat 2018-11-11 07:33:02 It has a sizeable cargo bay size of 20 blocks long by 5 blocks wide by 4 blocks tall.
Adaptable for paratroops or a small vehicle.
creations-chat 2018-11-11 07:34:47 These are the main lift engines for keeping the aircraft in the air in VTOL flight.
creations-chat 2018-11-11 07:35:40 Circled in red are the frontal pitch and yaw engines for VTOL.
creations-chat 2018-11-11 07:37:51 These are the rest of the VTOL controls. 
Circled in red are the secondary lift engines for gaining altitude in VTOL flight.
Circled in blue are roll engines.
Circled in green is one of the rear yaw engines
Circled in yellow are the rear pitch engines.
creations-chat 2018-11-11 07:40:01 The entire creation has 650 parts (not including seats for paratroopers or the land vehicle)

This has been boymahina123, peace out.

Im planning to make a small Navy SEAL type infiltration minisub and add it to my sub.
creations-chat 2018-11-18 14:33:35 The self destruct is only kinda useful when i sneak up and get under an enemy ship, get as close to the surface as i can without popping out of the water, and then self destruct.

The Mitsubishi F1 Strike Aircraft
creations-chat 2018-11-22 01:28:49 Wings and tailplanes are anhedral.
Canopy can be opened and closed.
creations-chat 2018-11-22 01:30:10 Flies like what you would expect from a strike aircraft
Kinda maneuverable but very limited dogfighting capability.
creations-chat 2018-11-22 01:32:16 Also has completely functional helium-based ejection seats (since the cockpit is 3x3x7 blocks i cant fit any other ejection system in there)
creations-chat 2018-11-22 01:33:19 Circled are the secondary pilot seat, canopy and main pilot seat
creations-chat 2018-11-22 01:34:18 And whats a strike aircraft without armament?
A total of 8 rockets and 10 guns.
creations-chat 2018-11-22 01:35:30 All in 736 parts (not as laggy as some of my other builds)

This has been boymahina123.

creations-chat 2018-11-22 04:46:15 That almost looks too good to use in PVP
creations-chat 2018-11-22 05:04:37 COM and COL should be close to each other.

creations-chat 2018-11-22 05:06:06 I incline towards perferring propeller engines with on/off mode
creations-chat 2018-11-22 05:07:00 Yeah...

creations-chat 2018-11-22 05:08:41 I picked up basic aerodynamics (even some intermediate and advanced aerodynamics) from wanting to become a pilot
creations-chat 2018-11-22 05:10:09 Where were his engines again?
creations-chat 2018-11-22 05:10:34 I mean Xero's engines on his B-2
creations-chat 2018-11-22 05:12:03 <@463776604242444329> whats ur problem with your B-2 again?
creations-chat 2018-11-22 05:13:09 And his Thrust line is under his COM?
creations-chat 2018-11-22 05:14:14 I took another look at his pic.
And now i know the exact problem
creations-chat 2018-11-22 05:15:36 His off-center thrust line and his COL being infront of his COM are making his plane do uncontrolled backflips
creations-chat 2018-11-22 05:16:41 I mean the COL is pushing the plane nose up
And the thrust is doing the same thing
creations-chat 2018-11-22 05:16:50 So backflips
creations-chat 2018-11-22 05:17:08 ^sweep the wings a bit more
creations-chat 2018-11-22 05:17:29 Or extend them slightly
creations-chat 2018-11-22 05:17:57 Mhm
creations-chat 2018-11-22 05:20:13 Like i said.
Either the off-center thrust line or the slightly forward COL arent problems on their own.
But have both of them in the same aircraft, compounded by the unusual tailless layout, and you have a backflipper
creations-chat 2018-11-22 05:20:58 Ik

If you wanna prevent swaying think of the heli as a ship on water. Then think abt how you prevent ur "ship" from "listing"

bug-reports 2019-03-08 23:30:44 The testing place is different from the main game.
Mainly the fact that we dont have our huge saves in the testing place to test

creations-chat 2019-05-04 15:42:19 Seems that the control surfaces are too close to the Center of Mass
creations-chat 2019-05-04 15:44:35 Nose pushing downwards...

It is a center of lift/center of mass issue
creations-chat 2019-05-04 15:45:14 Is it slightly forward or slightly aft of the center of mass?
creations-chat 2019-05-04 15:46:01 Yeah. That tends to pitch the aircraft nose down
creations-chat 2019-05-04 15:46:40 Push center of lift forward or push center of mass backwards
creations-chat 2019-05-04 15:46:46 Also yes
creations-chat 2019-05-04 15:48:04 Push the rudders backwards too.
The further they are from the center of mass, the more effective they are at steering
creations-chat 2019-05-04 15:52:34 "wider" generally means adding more front-back length to the wings <@252969342394826752>
creations-chat 2019-05-04 15:53:08 "longer" usually means more wingspan
creations-chat 2019-05-04 16:06:38 Hmmm
creations-chat 2019-05-04 16:07:34 I have a hunch that your plane's fuselage isnt long enough for your wingspan
creations-chat 2019-09-10 08:58:16 Make it robux purchaseable
bug-reports 2019-09-15 12:26:07 The wheels on my tank all turn in the same direction
bug-reports 2019-09-15 12:26:13 so steering is impossible
