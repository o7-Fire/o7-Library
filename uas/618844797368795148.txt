creations-chat 2021-01-12 18:16:55 <@!741442326181969961> The cable in the middle (red marking) holds up the whole structure and the side cables (blue markings) is used to avoid the table to flip over. What you have done is a tensegrity table.
creations-chat 2021-01-12 18:22:34 I call it a tensegrity table
creations-chat 2021-04-10 22:39:33 I’m working on a rocket named space bean 2 (don’t question the name) whats the best way to stabilize and give it the right thrust to fly instead of flipping over and becoming a 300 feet laser guided missile?
