creations-chat 2021-09-10 17:23:49 oh wow that's cool
creations-chat 2021-09-10 17:25:56 maybe add some wing lights, idk.
creations-chat 2021-09-10 17:29:41 looks fine to me. maybe cause the afterburner in the back isn't on.
creations-chat 2021-09-10 17:31:47 yeah I know that.
creations-chat 2021-09-10 17:34:41 now that looks epic.

bot-central 2021-10-01 19:20:15 SO CLOSE
creations-chat 2021-10-03 18:56:13 ima try to make the facility look more better
creations-chat 2021-10-03 18:59:55 oh
creations-chat 2021-10-03 19:02:08 well pretty sure I wont be adding anything else to it, just maybe fixing some issues, like this issue with one of the signs.
creations-chat 2021-10-03 19:04:38 this is what the sign used to say
creations-chat 2021-10-03 19:09:38 ?
creations-chat 2021-10-20 21:22:39 what should i add to my P-38 Lightning?
creations-chat 2021-10-20 21:24:43 Its quite cool.
creations-chat 2021-10-20 21:26:51 alr.
bug-reports 2021-10-24 17:23:19 that happens to me sometimes, where it randomly gets tagged. also be careful, because having to many signs will most likely cause some of the signs to not save their text.
bug-reports 2021-11-28 21:19:01 there's a glitch where if you have any motors on your creation, for example solar panels that can fold (using more than 1 motor) they go insane and move by their self, basically causing the creation to glitch out.
bug-reports 2021-11-28 21:20:10 as well as a glitch with the anchor blocks not anchoring properly, where even though they are anchored, they decide to unanchor themselves
bug-reports 2021-12-10 19:28:40 signs keep breaking, causing designs using the text/sign blocks to not appear properly
bug-reports 2021-12-10 19:30:18 it also causes the text on the sign to not work, basically making the text size 100 and making the only first word appearing, or cutting off the end of the sentence.
bug-reports 2021-12-11 01:45:10 game crashed while going into first person :I
bug-reports 2021-12-11 02:36:10 yes my pc is bad
bug-reports 2021-12-11 23:50:51 wobbly motor/motor2 glitch, the motor2s on my boat keep wobbling like crazy.
bug-reports 2021-12-11 23:52:14 maybe because the motors aren't strong enough to stop itself from over-rotating. maybe add some sort of "anti over-rotation" toggle in plane crazy 2 that can be used to stop motors from going crazy
bug-reports 2021-12-12 00:38:28 oh i forgot, sorry
bug-reports 2021-12-12 00:38:48 its just very annoying when motors do that
creations-chat 2021-12-12 00:42:44 I need suggestions for what I should add to my ***HydroFoil Trident 55 "Tri-Hull" Ship*** please
creations-chat 2021-12-12 00:46:27 good idea
creations-chat 2021-12-12 00:48:46 lol I might just be done with the Trident ship, since it has a lot of parts, and I don't want to lag out my game upon spawning it.
creations-chat 2021-12-12 00:53:07 ... already did <@!401530469952389130>
Oh and also it took a while to make.
bug-reports 2021-12-12 01:21:51 yes
bot-central 2021-12-12 17:27:19 !rank
creations-chat 2021-12-12 17:55:28 cool
bug-reports 2021-12-12 18:17:55 lights keep turning off, could be useful if the lights had a toggle button that is titled "force light on upon using keybind" that is used to keep the light on no matter what. since its annoying that the lights on my boat keep turning off randomly.
bug-reports 2021-12-12 18:21:00 dang it. I forgot again.
help 2021-12-12 18:43:00 yeah in <#623337136267067393> but its closed
help 2021-12-12 18:43:18 until there's a better way of reporting people
help 2021-12-13 16:32:52 placing a block out of the build zone is even more illegal
help 2021-12-13 16:32:58 and yes its possible
help 2021-12-13 16:33:20 yeah :I
help 2021-12-13 16:33:49 anyways Ima try to figure out what to do
help 2021-12-13 16:34:11 eh
bug-reports 2021-12-17 01:35:13 Plane keeps on trying to become a bird because of the wobbly motor glitch, lol its actually funny but also annoying.
bug-reports 2021-12-17 01:45:03 oh, and also no, the plane isn't supposed to do that.
bug-reports 2021-12-17 02:16:52 motor 2
bug-reports 2021-12-30 19:29:50 its been a while, but I've been thinking. maybe some creations require wobbly motors, so maybe add a toggle button that allows people to turn on or off wobbly motors.
bug-reports 2021-12-30 19:30:53 for example, somebody made a flag, and it doesnt look realistic. so they want to use wobbly motors to make it more realistic (like wind blowing the flag)
bug-reports 2021-12-30 19:34:02 yes ik its a bug. but sometimes its useful for decorations
bug-reports 2021-12-30 19:35:35 and also this is continuing from my wobbly motor bug report from a while ago.
bug-reports 2021-12-30 19:38:57 no i did make a bug report about the wobbly motor glitch a while ago
bug-reports 2021-12-30 19:39:48 a suggestion about making a glitch useful
bug-reports 2021-12-30 19:40:13 and besides, i cant access <#507673335816126509> yet
bug-reports 2021-12-30 19:41:22 i dont have permission to use <#507673335816126509> yet
