creations-chat 2020-11-01 01:11:20 i dont think anybody uses them for pvp, from what i can tell by simple sight is that theyre extremely laggy and they usually move slow, making them easy to aim at

creations-chat 2020-11-05 08:26:52 Adding more details require more time, plus it makes the build much, MUCH cooler, Smaller builds just have to have some resemblance to it and done (or some more details if its even possible at those scales)
creations-chat 2020-11-05 08:30:17 Although ill concede, people who manage to cram tons and tons of details into a small package is pretty impressive, people downvote because they dont see all the thinking and planning behind them
creations-chat 2020-11-05 08:34:21 Bigger builds have more presence, i guess? So thats why you go big or go home

creations-chat 2020-11-12 18:55:55 ok but he probably just saw how it looks and breh lets be honest, its not the nicest looking innit
creations-chat 2020-11-12 18:57:27 people only take in account how it looks these days mate (bruh of course a 30 min build wont be praised by god himself)
creations-chat 2020-11-12 18:58:58 what did you expect from a 30 minute build, 300 upvotes? (besides, upvotes are just what people think about your build, if you like it then sure, its the opinion of someone that is not you)
