plane-crazy 2020-05-16 18:45:20 am i the only one who don't know how to use this glitch?
plane-crazy 2020-05-16 14:43:59 is it just me or rick fixed suspension?
i mean, before it was funky and now it's smooth and it don't locks itself when two sides of suspension touch each other
plane-crazy 2020-05-13 08:23:22 i got rick-rolled
plane-crazy 2020-05-13 08:23:16 but when i wanted ice cream
plane-crazy 2020-05-13 08:23:08 he pretended to have ice cream
plane-crazy 2020-05-13 08:23:00 so i met a guy on a test server
plane-crazy 2020-05-12 08:38:15 you kinda need helium to make blimps, at least i don't know other methods
plane-crazy 2020-05-12 08:20:18 is there any methods on stabilizing them?
if not then how tf they're standng
plane-crazy 2020-05-11 12:26:13 if it's possible
plane-crazy 2020-05-11 12:26:08 where do i get it
plane-crazy 2020-05-11 12:22:32 im propably the last one that don't know about it
plane-crazy 2020-05-11 12:22:17 what speaker are you guys talking about
plane-crazy 2020-05-08 16:07:51 true
plane-crazy 2020-05-08 15:58:58 might be possible but very hard
plane-crazy 2020-05-08 15:58:50 im trying to balance with hover engines, drive with motors etc.
plane-crazy 2020-05-08 15:58:02 now is it possible to build a monowheel?
plane-crazy 2020-05-07 18:45:19 i already joned public
plane-crazy 2020-05-07 18:44:19 alright im joining
plane-crazy 2020-05-07 18:41:27 it's a private server but i can go to normal
plane-crazy 2020-05-07 18:40:13 here it is
plane-crazy 2020-05-07 18:38:52 i propably did wrong everything that's possible to do wrong with this suspension
plane-crazy 2020-05-07 18:26:08 aight so body for this double-wishbone suspension is kinda made, only problem is motors
plane-crazy 2020-05-07 18:11:38 i'll try later
plane-crazy 2020-05-07 18:11:11 is it possible to make a double-wishbone suspension?
plane-crazy 2020-05-06 19:52:25 how tf does it move
plane-crazy 2020-05-06 19:52:02 > but it has about 10k blocks
bruh did you meant 1k?
plane-crazy 2020-05-06 19:50:38 just explosive rc car
plane-crazy 2020-05-06 19:50:37 i once had anti-tank land drone
plane-crazy 2020-05-06 19:49:57 especially kamikaze ones
plane-crazy 2020-05-06 19:49:40 drones are preety op in pvp mode
plane-crazy 2020-05-06 19:48:24 imagine having a spinning turret in like armored patrol
plane-crazy 2020-05-06 19:47:13 or someone just built a spinning turret and says "IM thE BesT aT pVp"
plane-crazy 2020-05-06 19:43:52 i sometimes wonder how tf this handles osu
plane-crazy 2020-05-06 19:43:17 or maybe it wasn't slow and it was because of my low-end pc
plane-crazy 2020-05-06 19:42:22 only minus was that carrier was slow af even tho it had like 4 or 5 water propellors
plane-crazy 2020-05-06 19:40:15 i once had a 1100+ blocks double-runway carrier without any anchor blocks and helium but i deleted it
plane-crazy 2020-05-06 15:39:32 is that angel from evangelion?
plane-crazy 2020-05-06 13:45:32 i suck at building
plane-crazy 2020-05-06 13:45:12 i fail in rockets, helis, cars and tanks
plane-crazy 2020-05-06 13:44:06 nah, i always fail in building tanks
plane-crazy 2020-05-06 13:42:46 any ideas what i can build? bored again
plane-crazy 2020-05-05 15:25:39 any ideas what i can build?
