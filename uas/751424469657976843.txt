help 2021-08-27 20:45:19 you put the lock too high
help 2021-08-27 20:45:57 the reason its that high is because youve put it above what the actual plane is
help 2021-08-27 20:46:17 its easy to fix it just needs like a block or 2 lower
help 2021-08-27 20:47:11 this is an image from a few hours ago but something like that
help 2021-08-27 20:47:26 so its lower than the top of the plane

creations-chat 2021-10-19 16:42:23 Your sentence doesn't make sense but the left is better.
creations-chat 2021-10-19 16:45:05 Springs can angle things like explosive blocks can only not in pvp thats probably why
