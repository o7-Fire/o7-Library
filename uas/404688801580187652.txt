creations-chat 2018-11-26 22:11:59 Jk
creations-chat 2018-11-26 22:12:02 Yes?
creations-chat 2018-11-26 22:12:28 It's called center of mass
creations-chat 2018-11-26 22:12:33 Your rockets are too loe
creations-chat 2018-11-26 22:12:35 Low
creations-chat 2018-11-26 22:13:02 So or you have another rocket higher then the center if mass or you just line the rockets with the center of mass
creations-chat 2018-11-26 22:15:08 And you might be able to hide an engine (at least a propellor one) at the back near the control surface
creations-chat 2018-11-26 22:17:15 :D
creations-chat 2018-11-26 22:17:21 So it's good now?
creations-chat 2018-11-26 22:17:32 And did you add another engine or moved the rockets?
creations-chat 2018-11-26 22:18:00 You might want to add mass to the back then
creations-chat 2018-11-26 22:18:06 Or helium at the front
creations-chat 2018-11-26 22:20:07 It will make it pull up if it goes down a tiny bit
creations-chat 2018-11-26 22:20:36 It will make the back want to go down=it will balance

help 2019-01-25 15:38:47 <@!382710083831988225> the more the yellow dot is in the back, it will go steeper up, and ballast blocks makes stuff heavier not lighter

bug-reports 2019-02-03 21:23:25 they have no bug beds left
bug-reports 2019-02-06 12:08:08 <@430121953656045569> may be too late, but usually resetting/spawning it in/ reloading it works
bug-reports 2019-02-06 13:44:38 I think it hits the plane fuselage

bug-reports 2019-02-06 14:33:51 
bug-reports 2019-02-09 21:03:54 if you have a gun in a plane while on a normal non pvp server it wont get thrust
bug-reports 2019-02-09 21:05:39 thats false <@541281927366311937> , its probably because your control surfaces are on the wrong side of the center of mass
bug-reports 2019-02-09 21:05:47 or smth like that
bug-reports 2019-02-09 21:06:04 its flipping its controls based on its position and the number of wings
bug-reports 2019-02-09 21:07:17 this thing pops up like 3 warnings a second
bug-reports 2019-02-09 22:26:24 Keybinds are broken for me just the fact that you can't spawn with guns on a normal server
bug-reports 2019-02-10 05:33:44 When I jump off my plane which has mouse control, it will keep on responding to the mouse controls but not to the keyboard even tho I'm not sitting
bug-reports 2019-02-14 12:42:58 im sad to say that it was confirmed that the mars rover opportunity is officialy dead, it's solar panels were coverd during a sandstorm 8 months ago and it hasnt been able to recharge since
bug-reports 2019-04-03 16:02:55 i dont know if this is intended, but when i drop fuel tanks off my creation, the fuel isnt affected and stays the same which makes no sense
