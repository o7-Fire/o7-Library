creations-chat 2021-09-21 12:21:12 I guess however it is always good to be encouraging; no matter how bad or good the build is üôÇ
creations-chat 2021-09-21 12:25:42 Hmm, I recommend you just smooth up the nose and cockpit a little then it will look great!

creations-chat 2022-01-15 22:56:59 <@!297120728342331392> Very nice MH-60 Jayhawk. There are a few things that I don‚Äôt like about it though, firstly it is really underscaled. Secondly  the tail flaperon on the back is way too small. Overall very nice build, 7/10
creations-chat 2022-01-15 22:59:30 I know but it‚Äôs no where near the right size and he/she forgot the small wing thing under the tail.

creations-chat 2022-05-27 13:20:08 LEGO is always an adjective. So LEGO bricks, LEGO elements, LEGO sets, etc. Never, ever "legos."
creations-chat 2022-05-27 13:22:42 The correct plural of LEGO is just ‚ÄòLEGO‚Äô (or, if the company has its way, ‚ÄòLEGO bricks‚Äô or ‚ÄòLEGO sets‚Äô). This is Brick Fanatics, after all, so we feel safe assuming you have a solid knowledge of the LEGO Group, its products and the terminology involved.
creations-chat 2022-05-27 13:27:26 I live in aus too and yeah although I hear everyone say Lego‚Äôs üò†  also welcome to the late night gang
creations-chat 2022-05-27 13:31:07 Lego stated that it is LEGO no matter the situation unless it is something belonging to lego (lego‚Äôs). Now shut up and learn.
creations-chat 2022-05-27 13:33:29 LEGO is always an adjective. So LEGO bricks, LEGO elements, LEGO sets, etc. Never, ever ‚Äúlegos.‚Äù

(This was from the LEGO group, so you can‚Äôt argue against it.)
creations-chat 2022-05-27 13:35:32 Also, you call multiple fish fish, deer are deer,. So you also have a terrible knowledge of plurals.
creations-chat 2022-05-27 13:37:40 No, LEGO stated that would not make sense, it is officially termed there are twenty seven LEGO bricks on the table.
creations-chat 2022-05-27 13:41:17 LEGO stated what I am saying so I am going off what the company who invented the 3 LEGO systems said, not a random person who clearly knows nothing about LEGO.
creations-chat 2022-05-27 13:44:26 Exactly lol I have build LEGO for 9 years so this  kid needs to shut up. We clearly know more that this stupid American. Also <@870152086044700682> can get banned for being 11 lol
