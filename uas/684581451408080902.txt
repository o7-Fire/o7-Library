the-dump 2020-05-22 02:06:36 I know this isnt the right server for this question but has anyone made a hover engine?
the-dump 2020-05-22 02:07:57 I have made one that has no foreseeable max speed and gains 4k speed a second.
the-dump 2020-05-22 02:11:27 Has it been done or did I make a new engine design?
the-dump 2020-05-22 02:15:42 Fricc
the-dump 2020-05-22 02:16:58 In all honsety most motors are the same thing so its pretty easy to make one
the-dump 2020-05-22 02:17:07 Especially suspension reliant ones
the-dump 2020-05-22 04:58:38 There have been less shredders recently...
the-dump 2020-05-22 04:58:51 Hopefully they arent planning something
the-dump 2020-05-22 05:00:14 Wait, are they called bugs or shredders? Ive heard them be referenced to as both

the-dump 2020-05-22 05:05:04 Exept if its helpful
the-dump 2020-05-22 05:06:24 I just checked the roblox store
the-dump 2020-05-22 05:06:40 Why do they sell protogen heads now?
the-dump 2020-05-22 05:06:53 Im not complaining
the-dump 2020-05-22 05:07:29 Its just a strange step in the direction of recruitment.
the-dump 2020-05-22 05:08:03 Question
the-dump 2020-05-22 05:08:20 Do jet engines need air in this game or do they just work?
the-dump 2020-05-22 05:08:31 Oh ok
the-dump 2020-05-22 05:17:09 I tried to think of how this would be executed but I realised I only know standard FRC code.
the-dump 2020-05-22 05:18:10 
the-dump 2020-05-22 05:30:25 Oh no
the-dump 2020-05-22 05:30:40 Should I delete it?
creations-chat 2020-08-12 01:46:53 I have realised that you can swim on the glass in the room where you get the water jet, so far my efforts to get a water propeller in the room have been futile.

the-dump 2020-09-12 02:17:00 
the-dump 2020-09-15 00:13:09 Why do people who dont know how to play plane crazy just not do the tutorial? Legit most people who ask for help say they didnt do the tutorial.
the-dump 2020-09-15 00:15:22 I get how some people don't understand how large their wings should be or have the engine in an area where it will force the entire plane down but come on!
the-dump 2020-09-15 00:15:46 ^^^
the-dump 2020-09-15 00:17:14 Wait really?!
the-dump 2020-09-15 00:18:50 Yeah, and the tutorial tells you that as well!
the-dump 2020-09-15 00:26:43 "Staff are less likely to give you a rank if your creation is considered to be low effort."
So what makes a build be considered normal effort, Is painting and making it smooth enough or what?

bot-central 2020-09-25 04:16:45 -mapsuggest deeper/wider water
[Map]
The deeper down you go the darker the water gets and the harder it is to move, maybe even making motors useless once you pass a certain depth and making rope useful for pulling and pushing joints
