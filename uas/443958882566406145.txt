bot-central 2020-11-07 22:43:02 &suggest [BUILDING] Customizable tracer colors.

This is how I invision this to work. The yellow tip on the guns can be painted. Whatever color the yellow tip is painted, the tracers will change to that color. This would be quite useful for, Sci-Fi builds, or any other builds that could be enhanced with this feature.

creations-chat 2020-12-07 04:36:03 well this is the beginning of some custom cargo plane thing
creations-chat 2020-12-08 00:22:33 this is how far ive gotten with the plane I started last night, but its still nowhere near complete. Im working on it though. Its completely custom.
creations-chat 2020-12-08 00:24:37 If you think it looks flat, no it isnt. Thats also exactly how I wanted it to look.

creations-chat 2021-02-07 01:09:28 make it look more like this, and also change the prop because default props are ugly
creations-chat 2021-02-07 01:11:29 no like make a custom prop
creations-chat 2021-02-07 01:13:30 did you use trails or propeller blades?
creations-chat 2021-02-07 01:15:33 then whats why it didnt do its job. just put a custom prop on and stick some rockets inside. also, can you send a side profile picture so its easier to point things out?
creations-chat 2021-02-07 01:17:34 motor lock them in

bug-reports 2021-05-16 03:50:41 thank you
creations-chat 2021-05-20 04:54:48 I dont see too many things wrong with it, but there are a couple things i think could use fixing.
1. Wings. They are too small in my opinion, so making them bigger would probably make the jet look a lot better
2. Vertical Stabilizer. Once again, it looks too small and looks like it was thrown together in the time span of 1 second.

Thats all the suggestions I have, and by no means is your jet bad. Those are just a few things I don't like about it.
creations-chat 2021-05-20 04:59:56 oh nice, do you have a picture?
creations-chat 2021-05-20 05:05:21 now thats what im talking about<:Upvote:490311647492309004>
