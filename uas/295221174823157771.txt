help 2020-04-09 18:15:51 I got a conveyor engine on me Su-57. Makes it wobble instead of a stable flight
help 2020-04-09 18:15:56 Using custom control panels
help 2020-04-09 18:16:35 that's the thing I don't know
help 2020-04-09 18:16:37 It wobbles
help 2020-04-09 18:16:41 so it loses and gains speed
help 2020-04-09 18:16:50 yea
help 2020-04-09 18:16:56 but when I put it lower than 5
help 2020-04-09 18:16:59 it just doesn't take off
help 2020-04-09 18:17:33 does it matter where the conveyor engine is placed relative to the center of gravity or  flight?
help 2020-04-09 18:18:55 hmm
help 2020-04-09 18:27:03 frick
help 2020-04-09 18:27:08 conveyor still doesn't work
help 2020-04-09 18:27:29 it's behind the center of gravity, and in front of the center of flight
help 2020-04-09 18:27:36 still wobbles
help 2020-04-09 18:27:47 used motors, suspension, springs, and pistons
help 2020-04-09 18:27:59 yes
help 2020-04-09 18:28:06 Maybe because it's a Sukhoi
help 2020-04-09 18:28:28 The plane isn't fully straight and could probably have something to do with that?
help 2020-04-09 18:28:33 Su-57

help 2020-04-09 18:51:57 it's literally just a motor
help 2020-04-09 18:52:00 with a conveyor
help 2020-04-09 18:52:13 I built a test plane with it and it was stable. Used a speed of 5

help 2020-04-09 18:52:25 Put supers on the plane
help 2020-04-09 18:52:27 it works
help 2020-04-09 18:52:47 Center of gravity?
help 2020-04-09 18:52:52 Or just the center of the plane
help 2020-04-09 18:53:08 mkay Imma try it
help 2020-04-09 18:55:37 yea no
help 2020-04-09 18:56:04 It just wobbles a little, then it starts to get worse.

help 2020-04-09 19:38:58 Very weird
help 2020-04-09 19:39:10 I got a conveyor engine tested and super rockets tested
help 2020-04-09 19:39:14 they both go the same speed
help 2020-04-09 19:39:24 but the super rockets have no wobble to the plane
help 2020-04-09 19:39:30 and the conveyor engine does
help 2020-04-09 19:39:36 tested seperately
help 2020-04-09 19:40:22 eh do conveyor engines get speed when something is hit???
help 2020-04-09 19:40:53 wth so my plane is the only one
help 2020-04-09 19:41:12 I put one then it hit the island and started gaining speed like hek
help 2020-04-09 19:41:24 lemme send a pic
help 2020-04-09 19:44:43 
help 2020-04-09 19:44:57 motor is unpowered

creations-chat 2020-04-09 19:54:01 well damn
help 2020-04-10 02:36:11 Building an Su-57, a conveyor engine is attached to it. When flown the conveyor engine makes the plane go up and down like a dolphin (not an ordinary wobble due to speed). When it hits an object the planes starts to gain crazy speed.
help 2020-04-10 02:36:14 Halp
help 2020-04-10 02:39:47 Please ping me if you have an answer. Thanks!
help 2020-08-23 23:07:13 do C-Engines glitch with control surfaces that use motor 2s?
