creations-chat 2022-09-24 13:13:33 i love looking at creations, but theres a huge lack of modern frigates or destroyers (such as the adelaide-class (modified ohp), the arleigh burke-class, the anzac-class frigate, krivak-class frigates and type 21 destroyers)
creations-chat 2022-09-24 13:16:01 no, i dont think bowspirits are on modern ships, and is probably smth else lmao i dont know either ||uh oh whitename with an opinion||
creations-chat 2022-09-24 13:22:08 you sense correctly random stranger
creations-chat 2022-09-24 13:24:31 however by definition i do indeed have a bitch, since the original meaning of the term is "female dog" ||it comes from old english Bicce, uh oh im a whitename tho ! ! ! ||
creations-chat 2022-09-24 13:26:36 youre also a whitename
creations-chat 2022-09-24 13:28:41 ANZAC-class frigates are smaller than arleigh burke, i think. so more ANZAC classes should be plausible
creations-chat 2022-09-24 13:31:01 too lazy to submit a build
creations-chat 2022-09-24 13:33:25 mate youre called literally a "Dry Spa". that name is kinda funny bro
creations-chat 2022-09-24 13:35:40 _if a build gets a lot of downvotes just due to a lack of motorlock i will literally upvote it_ <:thchoink:527880803456122891> 

and for some reason the one-block wide jets just look epic
creations-chat 2022-09-24 13:37:44 you say that purely because theyre hard to hit in pvp _if maneuverable and stable_
creations-chat 2022-09-24 13:40:08 literally everyone who uses the rating system in <#384025409945337856>  would disagree (downvote! you didnt add any motorlock!)

creations-chat 2022-09-26 18:04:37 sometimes not even general guides on certain vehicles will satiate the inner laziness of these 8 year olds

(aka things such as fireyoblivions rotor guides, plane guides, boat guides or aria ch.s advanced shipbuilding)

creations-chat 2022-09-28 07:22:07 like, every airliner was just blocks or poorly put together shapes that fly
creations-chat 2022-09-28 07:24:13 when plane crazy was like 1 year old nothing even got close to that airliner
creations-chat 2022-09-28 13:33:45 the small no motorlock destroyer is very epic considering there’s no motorlock and it looks epic still

help 2022-09-28 15:25:40 bro it’s Air Force one that would be kinda stupid
help 2022-09-28 15:26:21 you mean too saturated?
help 2022-09-28 15:26:35 (problem: some people like saturated and bright colours)
help 2022-09-28 15:28:51 he asked, yes, but it’s quite a goofy suggestion
help 2022-09-28 15:29:25 elaborate? I’d say, if he thought the colours were off, he’d probably change them
help 2022-09-28 15:30:09 different opinion on “good colours”
help 2022-09-28 15:30:45 show
help 2022-09-28 15:33:11 that isn’t… about the colour
help 2022-09-28 15:33:36 he meant to reply to this, I think. it seems rather sensible
help 2022-09-28 15:34:00 r
help 2022-09-28 15:34:24 I never said anything… about the word usage
help 2022-09-28 15:34:57 it’s spelled “colour” in original modern English (British English)
help 2022-09-28 15:35:40 and this “u” variant thingy majig is in “favourite” and “mum” as well as basic examples, australia uses this and I’m Australian <:stuff:908917207986208828>
help 2022-09-28 15:36:08 what no “color” being a typo would’ve been way more accurate considering it’s the bootleg spelling from America
help 2022-09-28 15:36:45 why does everyone who learns English as a foreigner learn the American version
help 2022-09-28 15:36:48 that’s super shit
help 2022-09-28 15:37:45 Muricans really be globalising their ripoff instead of the original. Just like Oreo and Hydrox, Doors and Rooms and uhhh smth else I forgot

help 2022-09-28 15:39:24 with an “I” is the goofy version from my perspective
help 2022-09-28 15:39:29 australia
help 2022-09-28 15:39:59 I walk outside. I live very near many tyre places. they all say “tyre” instead of “tire”
help 2022-09-28 15:40:44 “say” does not always mean spoken audibly lmao
help 2022-09-28 15:40:52 I just said that say doesn’t always mean spoken audibly
