bug-reports 2022-07-03 12:01:47 I lag like crazy whenever I touch water in game.
bug-reports 2022-07-03 12:56:01 my build is 2000.....
bug-reports 2022-07-03 12:59:25 well ig my destroyer flies now
bug-reports 2022-07-03 12:59:33 water is too uninhabitable
bug-reports 2022-07-03 16:57:25 Whenever I make a plane now, the control surfaces invert so the top of my monitor makes the plane go down when it should be the opposite.
bug-reports 2022-07-06 18:44:02 how do i fix this
bug-reports 2022-07-06 18:47:04 I fixed it by using control surface 1x1 instead of 1x2
bug-reports 2022-07-06 18:51:59 No it is a glitch
bug-reports 2022-07-06 18:52:05 I just fixed it then it happened again
bug-reports 2022-07-06 18:56:04 I have to keep replacing my control surfaces every time i want to fly
bug-reports 2022-07-17 17:35:35 My build is missing loads of standard 1x1x1 blocks and apparently I reached my block cap. But water is less laggy when I spawn my build in. I had to replace tons of stuff with 1x0.9 blocks.
