bug-reports 2021-11-14 13:48:36 Motor 2 on mobile. Whenever you press a control button, the motor 2 will face the direction of the button you pressed.

(Idea to fix: make control buttons a blind spot for it, basically its a space where nothing will happen if you click it other than the control button being pressed)
