creations-chat 2019-01-09 15:40:28 Wery interesning experement for me.
I calld it "CrazyRocketBall". This is something between foorball and pinball. Controls: first player left flipper: "a" "d" "w". first player second flipper: "f" "h" "r". second player first flipper: "j" "l' "i". second player second flipper: "numpad4" "numpad6" "numpad8". Press "1" to shake. Press "q" to anchor/unanchor. Game is fully trust, because opponent can press your buttons, and you his. After win, ball giving to winner. At first round player 1 owns ball. I hope someone interested
