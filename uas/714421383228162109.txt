the-dump 2022-08-26 19:08:15 ok
the-dump 2022-08-29 05:43:37 
the-dump 2022-08-29 05:45:02 ~~he~~ the CIA
the-dump 2022-08-29 06:57:18 ikr
the-dump 2022-08-29 06:57:34 goddamn weakling micro organisms
the-dump 2022-08-29 07:12:39 well thats just obvious
the-dump 2022-08-29 07:12:42 china would lose
the-dump 2022-08-29 07:12:51 they got like one big aircraft carrier
the-dump 2022-08-29 07:12:57 they have 60 j20s
the-dump 2022-08-29 07:13:16 america has like  600 f35s
the-dump 2022-08-29 07:13:40 yeah that is true
the-dump 2022-08-29 07:13:51 but america would just bomb the shit out of them
the-dump 2022-08-29 07:14:16 and if the three gorges dam is destroyed, then ~40 million people would either die or be displaced
the-dump 2022-08-29 07:14:27 and loads of industry would be wiped out
the-dump 2022-08-29 07:14:58 china is like north korea but slightly less "bad"
the-dump 2022-08-29 07:15:04 if you know what i mean
the-dump 2022-08-29 07:15:14 they are *slightly* less totalitarian
the-dump 2022-08-29 07:15:26 and the living conditions are mostly a lot better
the-dump 2022-08-29 07:15:39 and chinese people are actually allowed to leave china lol
the-dump 2022-08-29 07:15:44 absolutely not
the-dump 2022-08-29 07:15:51 im pretty sure america does
the-dump 2022-08-29 07:16:09 china has more ships
the-dump 2022-08-29 07:16:20 but american ones are bigger and most are objectively better
the-dump 2022-08-29 07:16:38 america has way more carriers
the-dump 2022-08-29 07:17:00 and all their aviation tech is like 40 years ahead of chinas
the-dump 2022-08-29 07:17:50 well maybe that is an exaggeration
the-dump 2022-08-29 07:17:57 its closer to like 20-30
the-dump 2022-08-29 07:18:01 but the point still stands
the-dump 2022-08-29 07:26:03 h20 is the chinese one
the-dump 2022-08-29 07:26:49 the design does look cool tho i will admit that
the-dump 2022-08-29 07:34:13 b2 entered service in the 90s
the-dump 2022-08-29 07:34:42 the h20 (as far as i know) is not yet in service
the-dump 2022-08-29 07:35:10 and its unlikely they have better technology in china than america
the-dump 2022-08-29 07:35:27 as far as i know there is no chinese area 51 or lockheed skunkworks
the-dump 2022-08-29 07:35:48 where america develop all their futuristic shit
the-dump 2022-08-29 07:37:11 they have a thing called "dream studio" but its nowhere near the scale of the skunkworks
the-dump 2022-08-29 07:37:34 that happened to me when i was researching pe8
the-dump 2022-08-29 07:39:26 only at low tier
the-dump 2022-08-29 07:39:28 also
the-dump 2022-08-29 07:39:33 have you ever played the yak 1?
the-dump 2022-08-29 07:39:47 la5 fn is great
the-dump 2022-08-29 07:39:50 la7 is great
the-dump 2022-08-29 07:39:54 yak 3 is great
the-dump 2022-08-29 07:39:59 yak 9 is great
the-dump 2022-08-29 07:40:15 the only thing wrong with them is low ammo count
the-dump 2022-08-29 07:40:26 but you can still get 2 kills easy with bad aim
the-dump 2022-08-29 07:40:32 coz the guns are good
the-dump 2022-08-29 07:48:22 that is a bad jet
the-dump 2022-08-29 07:48:30 a prop can kill that thing
the-dump 2022-08-29 07:48:53 get american jets
the-dump 2022-08-29 07:49:05 like f105
the-dump 2022-08-29 07:49:13 my favourite jet in warthunder

creations-chat 2022-12-29 17:04:52 WIP f14 cockpit and nose, any suggestions?
creations-chat 2022-12-29 19:22:07 what do you think about my design for a napalm bomb? any suggestions? (reference image attached)
creations-chat 2022-12-29 19:24:22 it works against either unmoving targets or very large targets, i tested it on a boat just now and it worked ok, but yeah if the bomb bounces or spins on the way down then its gonna be unpredictable
creations-chat 2022-12-29 19:31:42 i mean yeah to be fair its not good as a pvp weapon, however theres not really any other way to make a ""working"" incendiary weapon in plane crazy
creations-chat 2022-12-29 19:38:40 ok but you can only use two lava spitters in a build
the-dump 2022-12-29 19:42:13 
creations-chat 2022-12-29 19:44:31 i would, but im trying to get it to look and function like a real life incendiary weapon, and that would be a bit complex to do in whats basically a 1x1 tube
help 2022-12-29 19:59:28 how do i make a suggestion?
