bug-reports 2021-10-02 01:49:41 I have been trying to put trapdoors on my jet for 2 days without them falling off now and I just realized that trapdoors are no longer staying on any of my builds
bug-reports 2021-10-02 01:51:39 It’s sorta like they just can’t attach to builds in any way and I know it wasn’t that way before
creations-chat 2021-10-25 01:20:17 hmm it appears I have been pinged, I wish I could make it tpose, but I could consider making kneecaps (idk if I want to)
creations-chat 2021-10-25 01:26:20 <@!479305807674998804> I think your build looks good, but 1: I always like a build if I see it, and well, if I like it, and 2: I am not good at giving feedback.
creations-chat 2021-10-25 01:30:28 creations-feedback is an interesting place, idk why I haven't stayed here before
creations-chat 2021-10-25 01:33:22 anything above 1:1 upvote to downvote ratio has to be good, if not rigged
creations-chat 2021-10-25 01:37:15 I’ll probably find that out over time

bot-central 2022-05-14 18:28:57 &suggest Truss Block
[Building]
A truss block, for whatever desired look or function you want. Could come in 1x1, 1x4, or 1x7, like existing beams.
bot-central 2022-05-14 18:29:02 Oof
