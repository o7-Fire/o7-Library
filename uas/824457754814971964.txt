help 2022-06-10 15:29:37 Oh
help 2022-06-10 15:29:49 Wait does this apply to mobile?
the-dump 2022-06-10 16:03:06 Isn’t that the same dozer that went on a spree of destruction on buildings and was sealed tight and it took hours to break the guy out before he killed himself before being caught?
creations-chat 2022-06-11 02:51:39 The controls scare me for some reason
contest-chat 2022-06-11 04:30:21 Do it
contest-chat 2022-06-11 04:30:38 Oh I thought the giant ring was part of the ship lmfao
contest-chat 2022-06-11 04:31:20 You could probably downsize it a little bit but maintain some of the details
contest-chat 2022-06-11 04:40:06 People would understand if you don’t considering the size of the ship and the stuff you gotta add to it
contest-chat 2022-06-11 05:04:46 Considering the fact that I just joined yesterday I’ll assume the server does care about the interior which probably means the models here are top notch and are probably created to be as realistic as possible since everyone here is pushing PC limits of how damn good can a model be before it’s considered to be from another game
