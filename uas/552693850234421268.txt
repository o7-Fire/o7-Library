help 2022-01-03 23:28:30 Hi. I need help. I am new to plane crazy and I followed a tutorial to make a Char 2C tank. The turrets are supposed to spin using a motor, and I have forward and backwards binded to Q and E. However, even when I use these keys, the motor does not budge. All that is clicked on is "Powered". Can I get help?
