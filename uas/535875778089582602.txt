here's a better view just in case it looks like I'm lying and just deleted my plane
bug-reports 2020-04-24 00:29:37 so that means if i remove the horn, the plane spawns?
bug-reports 2020-04-24 00:30:06 imma try it real quick
bug-reports 2020-04-26 20:12:46 https://gyazo.com/65b654c26ea7047af471dff4f06c54b1
dunno if this is supposed to happen when you use suspension to make recoil for a tank gun

creations-chat 2020-08-22 01:31:02 totally not a photoshopped plane https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/712034461059121223/746540998297124914/unknown.png

creations-chat 2020-08-26 00:22:12 different cannon
creations-chat 2020-08-26 00:22:15 and armor
creations-chat 2020-08-26 00:22:33 they are slightly different
creations-chat 2020-08-26 00:22:44 frontal armor of h is 80mm
creations-chat 2020-08-26 00:22:54 i think the f2 is 50
creations-chat 2020-08-26 00:23:14 also the h and g cannons penetrate more armor
creations-chat 2020-08-26 00:23:21 not by much tho
creations-chat 2020-08-26 00:23:26 very little difference
creations-chat 2020-08-26 00:24:20 panzer 4 h and g pen 140mm while f2 pen 138
creations-chat 2020-08-26 00:25:00 btw the panzer 4 h with added track armor is 100mm
creations-chat 2020-08-26 00:25:22 they are not the same lol just admit that
creations-chat 2020-08-26 00:25:44 g isnt either
creations-chat 2020-08-26 00:25:46 80mm
creations-chat 2020-08-26 00:25:51 frontal armor is 80
creations-chat 2020-08-26 00:25:57 unlike the f2 which is 50
creations-chat 2020-08-26 00:27:04 f1 is more classic
creations-chat 2020-08-26 00:27:38 has the classic 75mm kwk37 cannon
creations-chat 2020-08-26 00:27:42 it not ugly
creations-chat 2020-08-26 00:27:48 its just ur opinion
creations-chat 2020-08-26 00:27:51 which i didnt ask for
creations-chat 2020-08-26 00:28:28 nah u is
creations-chat 2020-08-26 00:28:36 stubby gun look more classic
creations-chat 2020-08-26 00:28:40 and it looks good to me
creations-chat 2020-08-26 00:29:06 he told me to make a pnzer 4 f2
creations-chat 2020-08-26 00:29:16 but i want to make the earlier version f1
creations-chat 2020-08-26 00:29:37 Im making the IV F1
creations-chat 2020-08-26 00:29:44 but he is tellin me to make the f2
creations-chat 2020-08-26 00:30:00 it looks superior to t34 which i dont like
creations-chat 2020-08-26 00:30:13 t34 must be dominant
creations-chat 2020-08-26 00:30:46 so basically at the time when the first 1940 model t34s came out the germans couldnt fight it with their panzer f1's
creations-chat 2020-08-26 00:30:55 and im making the f1
creations-chat 2020-08-26 00:31:04 but hes like "the f2 is better"
creations-chat 2020-08-26 00:31:30 just makin an f1 tho but hes tryna change my mind
creations-chat 2020-08-26 00:31:38 yea sure
creations-chat 2020-08-26 00:31:51 never really asked
creations-chat 2020-08-26 00:32:16 f2 is for noobs who cant defeat t34's without a strong gun
