the-dump 2020-06-01 07:07:02 hey guys, im not sure if this is fake or not, but tomorrow (june 1st) and throughout June, a large group of 4chan users are gonna raid social media such as discord, twitter, tiktok, etc. posting disgusting imagery and other stuff to offend people that are lgbtq+, and are going by the name of 'Operation Pridefall'. some will even go as far as to try to doxx people and that kind of stuff. once again, i'm not sure if this is a hoax or not, but do NOT click any suspicious links, and if someone messages you asking about your sexuality or sending NSFW imagery for no reason, block and report them immediately.
