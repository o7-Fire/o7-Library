help 2019-03-22 15:51:29 Ok thanks
help 2019-03-23 19:35:12 I have a vehicle made with 200 explosive blocks and with the update that added explosive balls my vehicle is missing many explosive blocks  I know you reduced the explosive block count to help reduce lag or some other good reason but I don't think explosive balls will be used that much
help 2019-03-23 19:40:18 Good point but I'm still angered

Wait, this machine is broken...

EXCLAMATION OF EXCITEMENT AND POSSIBLY DISTRESS!

Another male Homo Sapien can be seen behind, shaking his head using his neck muscles in the intention of showing physical dissapointment toward his team for not having it prepared as of yet

the-dump 2020-05-07 18:15:17 An adult male Homo Sapien of an unknown age with an unfamiliar background has plunged into the large natural stream of water made of H20 particles on its route towards the sea, a larger body of water, located within a large town constructed out of interlocking plastic building blocks created by a team of construction works who have no gone to university for engineering and architecture just yet. Switch on the engine of the aerial vehicle with horizontally revolving overhead rotors used for saving entities from danger. 

Wait, this machine is broken...

EXCLAMATION OF EXCITEMENT AND POSSIBLY DISTRESS!

Another male Homo Sapien can be seen behind, shaking his head using his neck muscles in the intention of showing physical dissapointment toward his team for not having it prepared as of yet

Construct the aerial vehicle that makes use of rotors to move through the air and proceed to remove the individual from his current, possibly life threatening, dangerous situation. Make ready the rope used for life saving, let down the framework used for carrying sick, injured, or dead people and take measures to extricate the being from his present peril.

The new Urgent Predicament Assortment from the large human settlement of interlocking plastic building blocks.

the-dump 2020-08-15 18:56:05 The missile knows where it is at all times. It knows this because it knows where it isn't, by subtracting where it is, from where it isn't, or where it isn't, from where it is, whichever is greater, it obtains a difference, or deviation. The guidance sub-system uses deviations to generate corrective commands to drive the missile from a position where it is, to a position where it isn't, and arriving at a position where it wasn't, it now is. Consequently, the position where it is, is now the position that it wasn't, and it follows that the position where it was, is now the position that it isn't. In the event of the position that it is in is not the position that it wasn't, the system has required a variation. The variation being the difference between where the missile is, and where it wasn't. If variation is considered to be a significant factor, it too, may be corrected by the GEA. However, the missile must also know where it was. The missile guidance computance scenario works as follows: Because a variation has modified some of the information the missile has obtained, it is not sure just where it is, however it is sure where it isn't, within reason, and it knows where it was. It now subracts where it should be, from where it wasn't, or vice versa. By differentiating this from the algebraic sum og where it shouldn't be, and where it was. It is able to obtain a deviation, and a variation, which is called "air"

the-dump 2023-06-13 23:34:18 you know I really dont understand all the hate against furries. I mean they are kinda weird (in my opinion) but that doesn't mean we should hate them.

the-dump 2023-06-27 01:16:37 but what is it called
the-dump 2023-06-27 18:49:54 ok and antifur propaganda tries to make furries look bad. your point?
the-dump 2023-06-27 19:07:15 ok and antifurs talk about killing furries. that is definitely a good reason to hate.
the-dump 2023-06-27 19:08:27 and what is that reason?
the-dump 2023-06-27 19:09:52 ok and humans are technically animals
the-dump 2023-06-27 19:10:32 also that is a stupid reason to hate someone
