the-dump 2021-05-29 08:02:29 Most of cellular respiration occurs in the matrix of the mitochondria, some processes occur in the cytoplasm of the cell. Glycolysis occurs in the cytoplasm of the cell which is turning glucose into pyruvate. Pyruvate is a 3 carbon molecule and it goes through the second process of respiration: the link reaction where the pyruvate reacts with oxygen and splits into carbon dioxide and 2 carbon molecule. The 2carbon molecule then combines with COA and form Acetyl COA. The acetyl COA then goes into the kreb cycle, where the acetyl COA goes through a chain of hydrogen ion reactions then come out as ATP. In the last process of cellular respiration, the electron carriers(NADH) form chains then the reaction ends with ATP synthase (Adenine diphosphate combines with an extra phosphate ion which then turns into adenine triphosphate, hence ATP)
