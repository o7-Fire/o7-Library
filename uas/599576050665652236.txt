plane-crazy 2020-07-11 09:21:05 no, you don't know
plane-crazy 2020-07-11 09:19:30 <:OkBuddy:652567204453154816>
plane-crazy 2020-07-11 09:15:04 a pixel art
plane-crazy 2020-07-11 07:32:16 <:OkBuddy:652567204453154816>
plane-crazy 2020-07-11 07:32:05 oh no
plane-crazy 2020-07-11 07:29:24 oh god no remove that technological device from my view
plane-crazy 2020-07-11 07:28:44 boomers when usa spends 700 billions on military: <:PewPew:532303441293344778>

plane-crazy 2020-07-11 07:25:07 lol
plane-crazy 2020-07-05 09:53:13 outlines
plane-crazy 2020-07-05 09:53:11 what
plane-crazy 2020-07-04 18:47:03 <:pain:644301805534183464> 4
plane-crazy 2020-07-04 18:45:00 there's always paint blocks if you really like using blocks
plane-crazy 2020-07-04 18:42:10 imagine not using 2000 blocks
plane-crazy 2020-07-04 18:41:07 did you just use all blocks
plane-crazy 2020-07-04 18:17:46 oh my god
plane-crazy 2020-07-04 17:38:00 no
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 19:27:42 ok
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 19:27:29 The only language I use where you don't need to define types is kotlin
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 19:27:02 I come from c, c++ and java so I'm used to this
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 19:25:14 It doesn't look hard tho
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 19:24:58 I never used this language before
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 19:21:45 what languages are you using
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 19:21:02 so you're actually making it
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 19:19:26 they're nice in their nosense
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 19:18:38 i just noticed
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 19:18:18 where did the lag ranks go
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 19:17:56 <:OkBuddy:652567204453154816>
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 19:16:19 then you can choose any color you want
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 19:16:12 you need an expert rank
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 19:15:32 why do i keep reinstalling roblox
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 19:12:58 That's what no one knows
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 19:11:52 Photons do have momentum
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 19:11:01 what black
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 19:10:14 lol
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 19:07:19 A force applied to a body causes acceleration, yes, what's wrong
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 19:06:44 lol
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 19:05:50 I repeat, I study aerospace engineering, I think I know physics already
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 19:05:25 I corrected him on the fact that "force is caused by acceleration"
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 19:05:03 I never said you don't
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 19:04:15 Which is not a force
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 19:03:41 it applies a force
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 19:03:37 the blade doesn't have a "force"
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 19:03:23 that's another thing
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 18:13:16 F = a*m , F is the amount of force you need to apply to a body with m mass to accelerate it at a acceleration
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 18:12:04 It's the kinetic energy that is high, not the "force"
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 18:11:49 If it's not accelerating, just going at that high speed, the resultant of the forces on it is 0
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 18:11:24 A rocket going at 100000m/s without any acceleration
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 18:10:59 you don't understand
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 18:10:00 a = F/m
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 18:09:55 F = a*m
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 18:09:46 Because that formula explains how acceleration is compared to mass and force applied
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 18:08:49 The force is what makes the body reach that speed
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 18:08:24 can you read what I said
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 18:08:09 it doesn't
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 18:07:34 It doesn't mean that F is "caused" by a
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 18:07:22 This is a formula
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 18:07:14 and it gains kinetic energy
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 18:07:09 the force is what you apply to make it accelerate
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 18:06:44 it has kinetic energy
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 18:06:36 it doesn't have force
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 18:06:11 I study aerospace engineering at university, I think I know physics
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 18:05:42 oh my god
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 18:05:08 A force applied to a body causes acceleration. The force is not caused by the acceleration
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 18:04:37 which is the  opposite of what i said
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 18:04:23 you said the force is caused by acceleration
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 18:03:13 and it's the force that causes acceleration not the opposite
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 18:02:43 the final force is the resultant
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 18:02:09 s-o-r-r-y
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 18:01:54 it's the acceleration of a body that's caused from the resultant of forces applied
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 18:01:20 yes and it doesn't mean that force is "caused" by acceleration
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 18:00:29 s-o-r-r-y
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 17:58:38 sorry
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 17:58:36 the force causes acceleration
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 17:58:20 and force is not caused by acceleration
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 17:58:02 sorry
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 17:57:05 force is not "caused" by the acceleration sorry
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 15:52:30 good luck
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 11:04:24 and they're like "haha u dead nooooob"
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 11:34:34 ok
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 11:32:13 infact i removed it istantly
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 11:31:55 it's an image extension, didn't know you needed to download it
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 11:30:07 because they only shred you if they blacklist you, or the opposite
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 11:26:29 ree
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 11:24:59 <:pain:644301805534183464>
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 11:22:02 oh no
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 11:15:46 but it took him too weak to mkae
plane-crazy 2020-06-24 08:19:36 all bans matter
plane-crazy 2020-06-22 07:39:38 it pushes from what i've seen
plane-crazy 2020-06-22 07:37:22 that must be my dna
plane-crazy 2020-06-22 07:37:08 and I'm italian lmao
plane-crazy 2020-06-22 07:36:16 It just looks like you want to create an argument, so goodbye
plane-crazy 2020-06-22 07:35:42 Ok goodbye
plane-crazy 2020-06-22 07:35:20 it's clear that I meant to say we should get a third one
plane-crazy 2020-06-22 07:33:35 how is it hard to understand the meaning of this sentence
plane-crazy 2020-06-22 07:31:24 people who already have 2 lava spitters should get a new one in this event, change my mind
plane-crazy 2020-06-21 11:28:38 what server is this
plane-crazy 2020-06-21 11:14:07 thx
