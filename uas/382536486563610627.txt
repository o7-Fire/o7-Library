creations-chat 2020-04-27 15:43:21 Plot was too small to build in the moons and I aint making a folding solar system
creations-chat 2020-04-27 15:43:32 Ive added the kuiper belt and planet 9 tho
creations-chat 2020-04-28 11:29:59 It is germoney solar system yes
creations-chat 2020-06-12 08:43:23 Is someone going around with a massive robot trying to rick roll the entire plane crazy community
help 2020-06-28 15:13:21 
help 2020-06-28 15:13:34 Help how should I build the barrel
help 2020-06-28 15:15:02 Uhh trail is kinda too thin and cylinder is too thicc
help 2020-06-28 15:15:21 And I dont hv enough guns to spam
help 2020-06-28 15:15:27 Is there any other option
help 2020-06-28 15:16:09 Hmm might try that(kinda off centered but ehh)
help 2020-06-28 15:16:15 On a side note
help 2020-06-28 15:16:26 Anyone here ever tried out reactive armor
help 2020-06-28 15:17:42 Mmm are they capable of destroying or reducing dmg from incoming tnt blocks?
help 2020-06-28 15:24:01 Oh rip I dont but when winter comes around ig I could use em
help 2020-06-28 15:24:09 But thx for info
help 2020-06-28 18:04:19 ooo good idea I was wondering how to use locked motors
help 2020-07-13 08:19:30 <@283153622496182274> plane wobble when stabilizer(horizontal or vertical) not big enough
help 2020-07-13 08:19:39 And speed too high
help 2020-07-13 08:19:52 I think its called phugoid oscillations but im not sure
help 2020-12-17 03:37:35 Hi guys anyone know how to make sparklers stick to each other(like in a gun barrel)
help 2020-12-17 03:42:53 The sparkler base doesnt extend to the sides of the block tho, so to speak
help 2020-12-17 03:43:00 So it would drop even with camera
help 2020-12-17 03:43:18 And I tried motor locking trails into the row of sparkleds but the sparklers just glitched out
help 2020-12-17 03:43:27 Im not that good at motorlock tho
help 2020-12-17 03:43:52 Oof ok
help 2020-12-17 03:45:17 Same as above, the sparkler base does not extend all the way to the edge
help 2020-12-17 03:45:23 Unlike motors etc.
help 2020-12-17 03:45:42 What
help 2020-12-17 03:45:44 How many sides weld
help 2020-12-17 03:45:54 Only one side welds?
help 2020-12-17 03:47:00 Then wouldnt I have to place the sparker bottoms all facing the same side
help 2020-12-17 03:47:04 Doesnt work for a gun barrel
help 2020-12-17 03:47:42 Uhh ok ill think and see what I can do
help 2020-12-17 03:48:14 O_O
help 2020-12-17 03:48:19 Ok me try

help 2020-12-17 03:56:14 kk
help 2022-05-01 06:14:18 How do I make custom landing gear?
help 2022-05-01 06:14:31 Need help with making the landing gear on a da40
help 2022-05-01 06:39:52 And do half blocks not generate lift? My wings dont seem to be working
help 2022-05-01 06:41:02 Youre telling me I spent hours making wings with custom control surfaces, motor locked winglets and working flaps for nothing?!
help 2022-05-01 06:41:30 Wait but ive seen someone make a plane fly using normal blocks as wings, normal blocks work but custom dont?
help 2022-05-01 06:42:17 Ooooo
help 2022-05-01 06:42:24 Ok me try that
help 2022-05-01 06:42:38 How to custom landing gear btw?
help 2022-05-01 06:43:40 Okies ty
help 2022-05-01 06:43:47 Nah my aircraft has fixed gear
help 2022-05-01 06:43:57 So just need to figure how to model the strut and wheel
help 2022-05-01 06:56:13 If I cant motor lock enough wing panels inside my wings I can just shove them into anywhere in my plane right
help 2022-05-01 07:06:49 Dont know if I have enough to lift my plane
help 2022-05-01 07:07:05 I built my main wings using half blocks so theyre not generating any lift
help 2022-05-01 07:07:17 Spent so much time, even made it aerofoil shaped and it wont lift lol
help 2022-05-01 07:39:02 Yep thats what im doin
help 2022-06-10 15:49:17 Guys, fuel in plane crazy travels by bluetooth?

bug-reports 2022-06-10 16:07:33 Anyone here ever have issues with the colour of text not saving?
bug-reports 2022-06-10 16:07:43 I have 2 text blocks in my build that for some reason refuse to stay black even after saving
bug-reports 2022-06-10 16:07:56 Try typing "Launch, H, X, F, Shift, Ctrl, B, N, T, R" into a 1x3 text, colouring it, saving it and loading it again
bug-reports 2022-06-10 16:08:31 I have been able to replicate this problem on different saves, it seems to exist for all text but not for signs
bug-reports 2022-06-10 16:09:06 How to make it save?
bug-reports 2022-06-10 16:09:46 I experimented length of text seems to have something to do with it...but I do have texts with more text that do save
bug-reports 2022-06-10 16:10:04 Dang
bug-reports 2022-06-10 16:10:41 Lol ic
bug-reports 2022-06-10 16:14:47 Yup I think I figured it out
bug-reports 2022-06-10 16:15:02 Putting multiple commas in a single text glitches it
bug-reports 2022-06-10 16:15:19 If you save ,,, and reload it, it will load as ,0,0,0,
bug-reports 2022-06-10 16:15:59 If you have some letters in front of the ,0,0,0, the game confuses the zeros at the end for the colour code or something and thus glitches out the colour
bug-reports 2022-06-10 16:18:53 By replacing commas with slashes the problem is fixed!
help 2022-06-27 14:23:22 What colours to use for afterburner trails?
help 2022-08-03 02:38:11 My plane was flying perfectly straight and level yesterday (and has been for a long time), how come it is suddenly out of balance today? I didnt make any changes to it
help 2022-08-03 02:38:34 If anyone has ideas for an elevator trim system im open to them too
help 2022-08-03 03:01:01 Screenshot won't help, I use a combination of ballast blocks, motorlocked wings and propeller torque to keep the plane straight and level
help 2022-08-03 03:28:26 Hmm possibly...my flaps were a bit glitchy today too
help 2022-09-24 05:22:18 Anyone know how to make a non-collidable wall?
help 2022-09-24 05:22:26 Saw it in some builds before but cant rmb which block it uses
help 2022-10-02 03:43:00 How do yall make elevator and rudder trim for ur planes?
help 2022-10-02 03:57:41 Do you attach the trim tabs to the back of your plane? Or just stick em within the hull
help 2023-07-02 03:53:16 how do yall stabilise your helicopters? I find that my heli has a tendency to yaw and roll when I move it forward, I suspect it is because the advancing rotor blade has a higher airspeed and thus generates more lift and drag than the retreating blade
help 2023-07-02 04:08:29 oh yeah the helium on a suspension does help
help 2023-07-02 04:08:43 any way to do it without helium though? it looks kinda ugly :p
help 2023-07-02 04:09:32 ahh
help 2023-07-02 04:10:11 inside the heli?
help 2023-07-02 04:16:55 ooh
help 2023-07-02 04:18:17 like counterrotating props?
help 2023-07-02 04:18:49 ohh
help 2023-07-02 04:19:19 ill try that, thx
