creations-chat 2023-01-02 06:52:54 No but fr, making mini build is difficult to add details to, your f14 looks great, however mini builds take a lot of effort. And also, the T-7 isn’t ass. It’s just not the BEST ONE. You know what I’m saying?? I said what I said as a joke 💀
creations-chat 2023-01-02 07:06:11 Also I don’t think my t-7 is even that much worse than your f14, just fyi

creations-chat 2023-01-18 06:14:42 Yeah try and make a one by one canopy frame that looks like that lol, so many hours….
creations-chat 2023-01-18 06:16:48 I’ll use an upside down half cylinder 2 👍
creations-chat 2023-01-18 06:19:43 I’ll just cam lock it. Or attempt it for the 8th time…

creations-chat 2023-01-21 21:01:58 That’s not a problem with the build tho lmao. I could easily press A and they’d be gone. Maybe my build was just so good that I couldn’t notice (my friend took the shader shots, I don’t have any. Has nothing to do with the shaders)
creations-chat 2023-01-21 21:04:28 K 👍👍👍
creations-chat 2023-01-21 21:28:31 What I gotta do to change that..??

creations-chat 2023-02-25 05:24:40 The first time.. I think October 2022
creations-chat 2023-02-25 05:26:54 Yea well there’s always someone online, and I figured things haven’t changed too much while I was gone
creations-chat 2023-02-25 05:29:14 Yea everyone thinks it’s an SR copy, but we even talked together abt how it’s hard to make a different frontal turret design. Thinks are cool 👍
creations-chat 2023-02-25 05:32:37 Oh I see, well it wasn’t the only reference lol

creations-chat 2023-02-25 07:54:38 Oh I’ve been here a while, just thought that question needed answering
creations-chat 2023-02-25 07:56:42 The most constructive and logical statement ever made in this channel:
creations-chat 2023-02-25 08:04:07 💀 (edit): ignoring the nose, I’m looking at the rest of the build and feeling quite disappointed. please tell me you have better builds than this (2nd edit):Then send a good build of yours
creations-chat 2023-02-25 08:06:23 Get off your high road and show us something you’re working on. And instead of calling it ass, I’ll constructively sh*i*t on it by naming every little thing wrong with it

creations-chat 2023-03-13 06:08:44 Also when my meme builds that take 30 minutes for a dare start to look better than that shiddy f-14 that looks like it’s parents were brother and sister- I think that’s when you wanna reconsider your values..
creations-chat 2023-03-13 06:11:27 <@939716590683979907>, stop being a puzzy and put your money where your mouth is. Not only do girls not like short diks like yours, they also don’t like asholes who think they’re better than everyone else, and belong on the short bus 💕💕

Also I’m not sure abt you, but the pcc is one of the saddest group of nobodies who care too much abt anything (you proved me right twice just now) the truth is, you have nothing in life to care abt and nobody in your life that cares abt you. So you take the only social life you have (discord) and try to find drama in whatever you can. You look for this attention online bc your parents never gave it to you (this explains the furry pfp) and there’s literally nothing you can do to prove me wrong bc you know I’m right, and you simply CHOOSE not to accept it. Just like your family never accepted you ❤️

creations-chat 2023-05-27 15:34:39 thx
creations-chat 2023-05-27 16:51:52 thx
creations-chat 2023-05-27 16:59:44 its so goofy how everyone here calls my stuff bad when they legit try to show me up with the 8737469587612th 2 wide F-14 with no livery
creations-chat 2023-05-27 17:05:11 ikr? everyone here is so dry. and they throw a hissy-fit when they see me post a good mini build. it simply enrages this community to hear the word "mini" and they expect me to care abt their opinions 😭
creations-chat 2023-05-27 17:13:21 any ideas? no..? give me something to work with next time.
creations-chat 2023-05-27 17:16:30 its one block wide 🤦‍♂️
creations-chat 2023-05-27 17:25:09 nothing i can do abt it, it is what it is
creations-chat 2023-05-27 17:34:16 Again, they expect me to care abt their personal options like they’re my own ✋💀
creations-chat 2023-05-27 17:39:02 ✋💀

creations-chat 2023-05-27 17:56:26 oh no, i expect criticizm. this isnt criticizm->https://discordapp.com/channels/384021699466756103/504436696021204992/1112060374980775936 theres nothing constructive behind mfs like this, they just dont like mini builds, good or bad
creations-chat 2023-05-27 17:59:39 boohoo ig :(((((
creations-chat 2023-05-27 18:21:35 im not above anything, just ppl's rude ass comments
creations-chat 2023-05-27 18:25:22 again, i dont care how other ppl see me. i know what "good" is, and i think i have the right to call my stuff good if it looks better than other things. im not gonna sugarcoat it or ask for attention, i think its good. why is this a problem
creations-chat 2023-05-27 18:29:58 and why does this matter so much rn?
creations-chat 2023-05-27 19:10:04 again, i dont care ✋ 💀
creations-chat 2023-05-27 19:12:06 yea but everyone talking shit has no good builds to shit on 💀 (ima go play warthunder
creations-chat 2023-05-27 19:32:33 why is everyone talking abt my build?? it just happens to be mini, leave it alone jeez
creations-chat 2023-05-27 19:34:34 ima go take a shower brb
creations-chat 2023-05-27 19:39:13 preesh man ❤️ look, only criticizm i want is what livery i should give it next. if theres a good looking camo you think would fit on my mig, @ me and ill consider it
creations-chat 2023-05-28 03:18:24 Wait til he finds out ✋💀
creations-chat 2023-05-28 03:26:21 It’s all cam lock
creations-chat 2023-05-28 06:02:32 What??
creations-chat 2023-05-28 06:05:07 Look at the seat above it. Do you not believe me or something?
creations-chat 2023-05-28 06:08:46 I used sparklers but I exploded the box thing. I build for the Mini Build Fan Club, that’s why I made this so small. Don’t hate me for it, bc odds are I made this mini AND above the average standard for PCC (I’m working on making the body one block longer, I messed up the dimensions lol)
creations-chat 2023-05-28 06:11:10 I can do a comparison photo tmr
creations-chat 2023-05-28 08:25:00 Fuck everyone else, don’t build for anyone but yourself. You can take breaks, bc you don’t need to please anyone but you. Build knowing that you’re impressive enough for you, and that no one else’s shitty opinions can change you. Figure out the hard way, it’s how you learn from your mistakes
creations-chat 2023-05-28 08:27:33 Goddamn
creations-chat 2023-05-29 18:17:47 Y’all, what kind of new livery should I give my mig-19?
creations-chat 2023-05-29 19:40:48 Ye, I used exploded sparklers for the canopy
creations-chat 2023-05-29 20:57:05 It’s 1x1
creations-chat 2023-05-29 21:01:08 Sparklers but with tnt to explode the square parts (and a horn’s ball to connect the front of the canopy to the back)
creations-chat 2023-05-29 21:03:23 Has to go above 500 sps, or it’ll stall out. Other than that, the basic control surfaces work wonders. It’s very smooth, and it it had landing gear it could butter easily
creations-chat 2023-05-29 21:05:55 I’ll tnt explode the box part of the game’s stock landing gear, and hide it in the fuselage arranged at an angle like in the rear gears of the f16, and then normal for the nose (tnt modified again)
creations-chat 2023-05-29 21:08:17 Also <@774081211860516864>, I can hide trapdoors in the cylinder body so that when the gear goes down, it looks like there’s a landing gear bay too 🙂 [thanks 👍]
creations-chat 2023-05-29 21:10:36 I’ve reached that point in plane crazy where I feel like I’m getting good 🦍
creations-chat 2023-05-29 21:13:55 If you’re doing 2x2 mig-19PL, use a half ball angled for the top of the air intake for that Sabre like indent, and a backwards 1x1 jet engine with a horn ball locked at the tip of the nozzle for a clean and smooth radar
creations-chat 2023-05-29 21:16:06 With this, https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/504436696021204992/1112849327220609024
creations-chat 2023-05-29 21:20:41 That’s gonna be my first edit, I hate the PL
creations-chat 2023-05-29 21:22:50 400 cameras, 4 wings that are each less than 2 blocks wide. You can fit a hover engine in there if you tnt modify the motor
creations-chat 2023-05-29 21:24:56 Did you see it despawned? 400 cameras more or less (<@774081211860516864> I agree 100%)
creations-chat 2023-05-29 21:27:09 Yup, I reached my plot border on all sides except one block at the back
creations-chat 2023-05-29 21:29:12 I’m on my phone rn, I’m not at home <:nooo:787097964946259978>
creations-chat 2023-05-29 21:38:41 Mhm.. it’s the ladder color… (I think he’s jealous it looks better than his builds) we do a mild amount of trolling around here <:trollface:775024642104229898>
creations-chat 2023-05-29 21:40:51 <@567763933952475157> I humbly disagree (oh boy, they’re cooking ✋🤣)
creations-chat 2023-05-29 21:43:16 Ima be honest, I just wanted to start something (it was getting a little dry here)
creations-chat 2023-05-29 21:46:22 Besides the fact that I need to increase the length by about a block, I think my mig looks smoother, and has a better livery (‼️MY OPINION‼️)
creations-chat 2023-05-29 21:48:29 Make this a speechbubble
creations-chat 2023-05-29 21:54:43 Istg every time I post something here, I get dms like “how did you do that? Can you help me build this? I wanna be like you! How’d you make it that small???” I’m fr gonna cry
creations-chat 2023-05-29 21:57:01 Exposed trapdoor. Thought it’d make the wings look depth-ier, but ig not. I’ll delete it
creations-chat 2023-05-29 21:59:11 I did.. every last fucking one of em 😭😭😭
creations-chat 2023-05-29 22:24:35 I HAVE MORE
creations-chat 2023-05-29 22:53:38 https://tenor.com/view/cryaboutit-wt-warthunder-r3-cry-gif-21570618
creations-chat 2023-05-29 22:55:51 I have a better like/dislike ratio 🥱🥱🥱
creations-chat 2023-05-29 22:59:43 (Only has likes bc it’s big) this server really doesn’t like that I make mini builds tho lol, I can’t tell you how much heat I’ve gotten simply because I make small tanks and jets
creations-chat 2023-05-29 23:03:32 Nah but fr. Considering how big that thing is, it should be hella smooth with pinpoint accuracy. I’m surprised you didn’t go all the way (<@1004207882784489472> I was originally talking abt the most recent two of our posts, not your shitty status in this even shittier community ✋💀)
creations-chat 2023-05-29 23:05:37 <@1004207882784489472>, you can’t say bad words 😹😹😹
creations-chat 2023-05-29 23:11:18 Some old stuff that I’m surprised got as many likes as they did, they got a ton of downvotes bc ppl don’t like mini builds, good or bad
creations-chat 2023-05-29 23:13:42 Ironically, most of the 9-10 people who did downvote my builds just don’t like me personally lol
creations-chat 2023-05-29 23:16:06 Ik, even when they are above average, ppl still just won’t hop off. Repeatedly calling them shitty, and telling me to quit PC lmao
creations-chat 2023-05-29 23:19:09 Yes. Also ppl always compare me to <@559568621312147476> bc he’s the only one here who is recognized for making good mini builds. If my shit isn’t as good as his, it’s not enough. And even when they are as good as stuff like his Tiger, there’s still someone there to talk shit
creations-chat 2023-05-29 23:21:12 I haven’t been here long enough to know who he is, can you send some of his builds?
creations-chat 2023-05-29 23:25:07 Oh shit nvm I remember now lol
creations-chat 2023-05-29 23:32:51 Nobody likes mini builds, and this community isn’t as active as it was a while ago. That’s why you don’t see as many likes on things now, many ppl quit, or lost interest. I wasn’t here for that period of pcc. Sorry I’m not the best, but I’m damn good
creations-chat 2023-05-29 23:36:19 And I don’t need 400 upvotes to prove it (7 ppl are online at a time nowadays)
creations-chat 2023-05-30 00:15:21 Nah <@1004207882784489472> that’s insane
creations-chat 2023-05-30 00:41:30 
creations-chat 2023-05-30 00:49:53 I love the wings on this MiG, there’s so much opportunity, I should add some cooler details on em next edit I make
creations-chat 2023-05-30 01:37:44 Jesus chill. Here’s a photoshopped image of it extended by a block. Can you overlay this rq? (DM’s)
creations-chat 2023-05-30 01:43:12 Y’all need to chill the fuck out, I’m still working on it. Like goddamn, y’all suck ass and attack me when something turns out below average. Fr stop riding my meat ✋
creations-chat 2023-05-30 01:54:23 Can someone overlay this with a MiG-19S blueprint?
creations-chat 2023-05-30 02:16:33 Aight this is the goal.. GOD DAMN HOP OFF FOR THE LOVE OF GOD. Y’ALL IS RIDING MY MEAT SO FUCKING HARD RN
creations-chat 2023-05-30 02:19:40 Do you expect me to be mad at this? It’s the basic geometry of the game and you didn’t even line it up right ✋💀
creations-chat 2023-05-30 02:23:43 Bitch your profile picture is prolly a 10/10 that you fumbled, and you don’t even have builds here to talk shit abt. You is prolly the loneliest, most unproductive mf on this damn server
creations-chat 2023-05-30 02:26:35 Ok there’s only so much I can do with a mini build, and I’m working. I like the way this is turning out
creations-chat 2023-05-30 02:28:41 Yup, that’s basically what a Mig is, not sure what you want me to do abt it
creations-chat 2023-05-30 02:30:47 Wrong variant, sorry (<@960280428911153163> still being added, it’s tough making room for all the camera lock when I’ve reached my plot borders on all sides)
