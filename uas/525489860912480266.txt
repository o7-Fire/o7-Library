creations-chat 2019-09-29 18:31:59 Introducing, the A-12B, my slightly futuristic take on the A-10C Thunderbolt II. Capable of reaching speeds of around 410, this beast packs a punch for any ground target that dare stand in its way. Equipped with hellfire and sidewinder missiles, 2 Dive bombs, 8 flares (4 on each side), and a carpet bomb payload on the bottom of about 10 mini bombs. It also has the unique ability to VTOL, thus the B in its name. It comes equipped with a night vision cam (that also lets me see through water...), wing tracers for kewlness, and an ejector seat
