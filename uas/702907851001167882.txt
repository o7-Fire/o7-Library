creations-chat 2021-02-19 07:18:45 this a pretty old version of this shuttle...i am working on orbiter for now ,i scrapped this and use only for testing things that i will add on the main one (also sneak peek because the newer version of this is even sexier)
creations-chat 2021-02-19 07:21:05 hmmm well i had posted it a few days ago if you did not see it in creations (you can go search in my mentions)
creations-chat 2021-02-19 07:23:08 this iswhen i posted it

creations-chat 2021-02-19 07:30:04 oooh you mean the boosters oh yeah , well i dont think the orbiter is complete yet...i will take it to the limits and when i am satisfied i will add those too
creations-chat 2021-02-19 07:34:15 is this shuttle good enough to get me a rank?
creations-chat 2021-02-19 07:36:33 fun fact..this is my 3rd ever shuttle ...1st was ..eh....second was good (i did 50+ missions with that) and this is my third one
creations-chat 2021-02-19 07:39:16 this is already 4k blocks without the tank(but with boosters) and can yaw roll pitch and has no helium
creations-chat 2021-02-19 07:41:40 hmmmm well i have done quite many flight tests of the orbiter and a few successful landings
creations-chat 2021-02-19 07:43:42 but honestly i dont "need" any rank...i love building and build for my satisfaction
creations-chat 2021-02-19 07:49:05 uhh mmmm k as you say wait by old you mean the latest version of it or the one with tank and boosters
creations-chat 2021-02-19 07:51:11 but how do i request a rank and what things i need to post and where

creations-chat 2021-05-09 14:58:59 this is the american space shuttle in sts-1 livery
creations-chat 2021-05-09 15:01:01 cuz this is the colour for sts-1 the first space shuttle mission
creations-chat 2021-05-09 15:03:09 this
creations-chat 2021-05-11 09:20:18 any feedback on this
creations-chat 2021-05-11 09:30:26 nice i really liked that concept
creations-chat 2021-05-11 09:32:28 ik
creations-chat 2021-05-11 11:34:34 Did i make them wrong?
creations-chat 2021-05-11 11:36:37 I knew someone would say that so good news i fixed the airbrake already
creations-chat 2021-05-11 11:38:43 Coming on the landing gears they look a bit bad in the pic but when they are closed they are 90% concealed (90% cuz the rear gears wheels are visible)
creations-chat 2021-05-11 15:24:13 I am scared to talk...you guys might drag others into this argument too 😓
creations-chat 2021-05-11 15:26:31 Ok and
creations-chat 2021-05-11 15:29:20 Btw <@!573840026601783298>  i have seen yoyr tanker and tbh i can see you added some detail on the top and it blends in with the body so its not that visible but TBH i think its a bit low effort you dont know but there is a reason why people are calling it bad ..so try and improve your skills and come back with a surprise...good luck!
creations-chat 2021-05-11 15:33:09 No problem!...its just that you have skill but needs to be improved a bit
creations-chat 2021-05-11 15:36:07 <@!573840026601783298> I have noticed a really bad habit with people that instead of encouraging newers or people with weak skills they instead criticize them so if people encourage them theres a chance they will get motivation and go forwards to build better ...i hope you keep up your motivation to build ...build for your pleasure not for others
creations-chat 2021-05-11 15:40:04 Cya bye
creations-chat 2021-05-11 15:50:09 True
creations-chat 2021-05-11 15:52:25 In such a game we cant even call anything low effort cuz people put effort into such builds to their own satisfaction and power to them they have put quite much effort so..yea
creations-chat 2021-05-11 15:54:53 Well thats another factor but calling proper builds low effort is not good..
creations-chat 2021-05-11 15:56:56 XD

creations-chat 2021-06-19 09:25:47 Thanks both of you! <@!723940197456281640>  and <@!803292176418078720>
creations-chat 2021-06-19 09:29:02 i did not keep a specific name for it , tho i will say that i created a modified version of it with tank coloured white for STS-1 and if you have shuttle knowledge you know that is columbia , so this orange tank one can play role as any of the rest (atlantis , discovery , challenger , endeavour) by just changing the name written below the front windows
creations-chat 2021-06-19 09:31:21 thats where it gets you , you gotta be up close to see the details and the size and the beauty of it
creations-chat 2021-06-19 09:33:27 very much thanks to all of you , i'll try to keep everyone updated of the new updates in this channel
creations-chat 2021-06-19 09:37:42 this is the sts-1 version i was talking about , tho i am not fond of this one since it was created before the one i posted before (cuz i used thsi oen as a testbed to test features for final version) it has tendency to break but thats rare and idk if it even flies lol
creations-chat 2021-06-19 09:39:54 aye doktar!
creations-chat 2021-06-19 09:42:13 in some time i will post the list of features and details it has
creations-chat 2021-06-19 10:10:52 <@!803292176418078720> <@!723940197456281640> so the features are :-
1-Gimballing shuttle main engines on both axis (left/right , up/down)

14-SRB(booster) nozzles also gimbal during flight
15-Can perform the real shuttle flight trajectory during launch and landing
16-Body flap (below main engines also moves during flight)
now the details:-

creations-chat 2021-08-25 14:17:11 Try to make the part above windows smooth it looks rough  rn (edit= oh ok)
creations-chat 2021-08-25 14:19:16 Half ball would look too round at this scale ,the nose shape is a bit pointy on that aircraft

creations-chat 2021-09-09 08:30:44 all you need is a little patience
creations-chat 2021-09-09 08:35:49 i'm trying to make this cord
creations-chat 2021-09-09 08:38:31 well...... ok as you wish , here it is
creations-chat 2021-09-09 08:41:12 its actually pretty short but camera angle makes ot look like long
creations-chat 2021-09-09 08:44:48 its my first one too lol , btw how do i post multiple pics at once
creations-chat 2021-09-09 08:48:47 aah that , well there are reasons for it , since i am using default suspension blocks for wheel suspension (cuz idk how to make proper tank suspension) the tank height gets lowered so turret feels tall , also camera angle is a thing that causes most of these deformities, i have checked it from the blueprints and feels good tho , but ill still try to fix the issue if there is
creations-chat 2021-09-09 08:52:50 thanks a lot tho and to <@!721103577380159490>  too
creations-chat 2021-09-09 08:55:54 the muzzle...hmm ill try to fix it if i can , thanks tho

creations-chat 2021-10-16 15:52:32 hard to replicate irl shape and still make barrel move and still look good and still make it small
creations-chat 2021-10-16 15:54:40 yea but this turret i showed is bigger than the one im gonna use on the hull i have already made , and .. it has to be 9 wide while the one in pic is 11 wide
creations-chat 2021-10-16 15:56:57 this is the hull (wip tho)
creations-chat 2021-10-16 16:08:20 the turret makes me wan to give up
creations-chat 2021-10-16 16:17:47 yea, but ill try tomorrow ill take break and play wot b
creations-chat 2021-10-17 07:55:22 Very nice i like it ,looka like a prebuilt one but still very nice
creations-chat 2021-10-17 07:59:57 Mechanic ,leave pcc and become a lawyer or a critique
creations-chat 2021-10-17 08:02:15 Oh yea thanks i might need that on my king tiger
creations-chat 2021-10-17 08:08:14 <@456226577798135808> your king tiger needs more details and its out of proportion ,i like tracks but the wheels are then non realistic and your body is too high so it makes turret look way too small
creations-chat 2021-10-17 08:10:15 I tried this one but for some reason roblox censors it :((
creations-chat 2021-10-18 14:38:05 feedback on t14 armata (wip) needed
creations-chat 2021-10-18 14:40:47 HOW MANY TIMES DO I TELL ITS WIP = WORK IN PROGRESS , it does not mean ill leave it like this so stop telling me pls....i wanna cry , just say its good or not rn or not cuz rn im just getting shape done , extra details and colour later
creations-chat 2021-10-18 14:42:53 an no it does not have camo , its basically just dark green with orange russian star thats it , no fancy camo
creations-chat 2021-10-18 14:52:50 <@!882419947819638825>
creations-chat 2021-10-18 15:04:56 but the feedback should make sense instead of always being "camo details colour" , you can clearly see the tank lacks those rn so it means i will add them later and obviously i wont leave it like that
creations-chat 2021-10-18 15:13:45 thanks , thats the proper feedback , also dw im gonna do everything so ill keep posting updates as i keep adding more details just need to know how does it look rn so that i may not need to fix shape in future

creations-chat 2021-10-26 16:42:45 Ah ok , try and add the fold motor close to the centre to kinda hide it
creations-chat 2021-10-26 16:46:24 You can just place the fold motor more towards the centre where the blades are attached to hide it

creations-chat 2021-11-13 14:28:57 Look closely they're there already (4th pic i think)

More darker? Well might be problem that i didnt take a pic from the view that showed clearly
creations-chat 2021-11-13 16:38:42 Lemme list the features:
1)Gun can elevate and depress
2)Turret can rotate 135 degrees one one side due to there being the antenna in the way
3)Gun has muzzle smoke and flash when it fires and the tank recoils too in the direction opposite where turret is facing
4)There is engine fire effect to mimic an engine fire duh lol
5)Tank can freely be driven around anywhere
6)Has rear exhaust pipe exhaust smoke
7)Has somewhat of a suspension
8)And the cooling vents fans work too
creations-chat 2021-11-13 16:40:52 The diorama was an after thought ,i did the tank first . But ngl i put quite some effort to make most of the functions work
creations-chat 2021-11-13 16:42:56 Its ok ,you know now anyways

second its like my first sci fi vtol thingy since thats not my genre so im quite pleased
third , your downvote doesnt matter to me
the wings were actually angled but it didnt fly good with that so in order to make it fly proper i had to make wings flat and also it doesnt have the rocket pods thingy , not everything is must have it <:empty:794431705070174238>

creations-chat 2021-12-15 13:43:51 i dont think cheating , but the reason is due to the million exposed motors and wrong parts on it

creations-chat 2021-12-15 14:03:48 oh you mean funny mustache man (no offense)
<@!757887014388367401> got it!
creations-chat 2021-12-15 14:06:36 lmfao
creations-chat 2021-12-16 11:34:58 no offense , but i'd gladly consider your feedback if it was more positive and not "unwanted" 
im also sorry for being rude before ,but ngl im not alone who may insult you on your feedback , if they dont do infront of you then they do behind or to others 
but if your way of giving fedback is more pleasant and less "shitty" and stuff everyone would be more eager to listen 
ik for you your feedback seems normal and some do consider even with the foul language but to many they cant accept their build being called straight up "shit" or "garbage"
not everything needs brute force
all i'd say is being nicer while talking would fix every problem others may have with you
hope you consider both my apology and advice.
creations-chat 2021-12-16 11:42:24 well im genuinely being honest and more nice than yesterday
creations-chat 2021-12-16 15:56:06 No exposed lock and good colours
creations-chat 2021-12-16 16:16:42 See ,i brought about the good inside you.
All you gotta do is use less abusive words and (try not to be a mass downvoter) and then boom you can become the best critique in the community and about the part of you honestly saying everything well... theres one problem is that you need to do research before giving feedback in certain cases 
Such as in my vtol thingy you said theres no rocket pod ,even tho its not present in the model i used, its not even present in the ingame one aswell .so try to be calm and do proper research for feedback as the person recieving will know that you actually know what you are talking about instead of thinking that you are blindly saying bad stuff about their build .just spread positivity
At last ill say im really pleased that instead of reacting harsh against my message you considered it. Gl on what i asked you to do and if you succeed its only gonna make things better
creations-chat 2021-12-16 16:24:53 Nice nice ,also pls accept my apology 👏
creations-chat 2021-12-16 16:28:03 Oh that.. yea while making it i also considered this design but thought it was too hard for me since i never made such things before so i used the model i showed before instead as it was easier and did some custom parts to make it less lame and underdetailed ,tho i was gonna add underwing weapons but since the only purpose for this vtol thing left for me was expert vtol rank as it was suposed to be for contest but couldnt post 

Wow im writing essays
creations-chat 2021-12-16 16:35:22 I did not say that he IS a mass downvoter ,i just said what most people call him

creations-chat 2021-12-29 18:11:40 Wow thats literally the same thing everyone else said when they saw it .But yea ik its my first roscale what can you expect.But ngl side view very pog

Also note: i finished this thing in like 4 hrs
creations-chat 2021-12-29 18:13:54 No cuz i wanted to get a sense of scale first also as ive never done this scale and usually do larger ones i did the motorloxk according to that and... the lock pretty cramped.
creations-chat 2021-12-29 18:17:12 Hm true i faced that.
I put mine below hull for the treads angling motors cuz i wanted full fake treads .
And i put a lot in turret infact 89% lock is in turret
creations-chat 2021-12-29 18:20:50 I dont have skill to that yet

creations-chat 2021-12-31 07:31:52 i see , its ok just try to add more details on lower sides and also the attachment thingy

creations-chat 2022-01-01 17:10:18 I kinda like it but the camera angle makes it look like 100:1
creations-chat 2022-01-01 17:15:43 Juicy, can ya try to make the black coloured part on nose move smoother into the canopy instead of a flat stop
creations-chat 2022-01-01 17:21:55 I literally forgot to add no. 6 i had that planned but forgor ,about shades and details i made it based the 3d model i was using and you cant see most on the tank irl or when in actual colour as in the 3rd pic you showed its not practical since you cant see most but i can still assure you there is more detail than its visible in the pics and about the last point yea i agree i went lazy with that 
About no.4 the tank is good proportion wise and has the plates just the seperation is not visible and on no.2 theres details just not visible in pics
Thank you.
creations-chat 2022-01-01 17:25:33 Mhm its my 2nd ever tank so ok ig

creations-chat 2022-01-14 18:00:45 What did i miss?
creations-chat 2022-01-14 18:02:48 Oh so you guys are discussing about that arctic explorer in hof?
creations-chat 2022-01-14 18:05:54 Tbh ,my habit is to try and avoid motorlocking as much as possible UNLESS i wanna smoothen a part or add a detail i wont be able to add otherwise ,i like a build thats mostly default and less locked or i should say overlocked
creations-chat 2022-01-14 18:08:00 Hm yea it is best in the genre but not in hof level position ,but eh the vipchat ones decide it idk what else we can say
creations-chat 2022-01-14 18:10:20 No i dont see a bias but uh the f22 yet its extremely good and accurate ,could be improved to reach that position of hof considering current aircraft standards
creations-chat 2022-01-14 18:12:34 True, now we should stop butchering other ppls hofs and the arctic explorer until it falls onto my king tiger too.

Totally not trying to defend myself :))
creations-chat 2022-01-15 05:47:22 <@747811503591129170> elevator colours 🤮
creations-chat 2022-01-15 06:56:57 oh what i meant was the leading edges of elevators aren't smooth (the lighter grey colour) you should just keep the whole elevator the darker one
creations-chat 2022-01-16 05:21:04 Fix treads
creations-chat 2022-01-16 05:23:35 I mean ,the undersides of treads arent painted you can clearly see the unpainted motors ,and the treads are too loose ,one way to fix that is adding more wheels per tread so it will also solve the issue of realism since like 6 wheels per tread look too weak for such a huge machine
creations-chat 2022-01-16 05:25:54 Cant you add extra wheels between the existing ones?

Youll have to practice with it its a very simple to use and efficient software when used properly.
You can just take the pic again but this time show the jets closer and then add text but not a filter unless you want to give it a certain vibe

creations-chat 2022-01-24 17:47:16 <@582552669307011107> you're pretty new to the game as i can see by the quality of the build . Id recommend just playing the game for fun and not pay attention to accuracy tho if you want to go that direction youll have to learn a lot of new concepts primarily motorlock . There are many tutorials about how to learn it on youtube go have a look.
Thanks
creations-chat 2022-01-24 17:49:49 I really love that car but can you push the wheels down so they look a bit seperate from the vehicle and also push seats down bc they stick out from the roof
creations-chat 2022-01-24 17:52:07 If you started playing two years ago then you did for fun i guess if you wanna go deeper into build quality go learn motorlock

creations-chat 2022-01-27 16:51:50 Yes they do move and took me a ~~lot~~ bit of pain to get them working smooth 

<@720156815802892348> yes dw its far from finished im just asking about general shape and s8de skirts
creations-chat 2022-01-27 16:55:16 E.... he clearly made a fictional spacraft  obviously not made to obey laws of physics.. but looka wise its a bit on low side
creations-chat 2022-01-27 17:12:08 Yea youre right
creations-chat 2022-01-27 17:51:54 Wow very nice and creative ,a shark but its an island but is actually a shark.. mm also build looks good too
creations-chat 2022-01-27 18:01:49 Posting the reference actually helped get a better idea so its not going against any rules ~~who cares about rules anyways they are there so people threaten each other for breaking them~~
creations-chat 2022-01-27 18:04:27 Hm yea but its ok dont be much hyper about it. Point it out once by saying like "try not to post reference inage because its against rules" and end it here

<@490593164445483028> it would be wiser to try to end it by saying its ok than forcing and teasing the other
creations-chat 2022-01-27 18:11:40 Tho gotta say at first i saw the reference and thought it was actually another image of the build lol

creations-chat 2022-01-30 03:13:48 E. Rn it looks a bit bland and uncoloured the stripes would fit percfectly and by stripes i mean the stripe that runs along the windows in concorde also the motor for the rudder <:Empty:823852793630687233>

<@456226577798135808> thats true too tho ,but pro people dont post such pics . Why? Because they know its not necessary
creations-chat 2022-01-30 18:27:33 Nah dont , its not as good as current standards and is just 20% done so dont continue and if you want one then make a new better one
creations-chat 2022-01-31 02:37:21 Yes ik but it didnt look like it was like 70% done so itd take him more time to finish it than make snthng new

creations-chat 2022-02-04 12:27:33 wait thats similar to mine
creations-chat 2022-02-04 12:30:09 oh mm nice
creations-chat 2022-02-04 12:33:45 nah its fine 

<@!714878625484243101> oka
creations-chat 2022-02-04 12:53:04 good
creations-chat 2022-02-04 13:05:26 <@!714878625484243101> add hazard signs and nuclear sign on each tank and make each tank longer but same diameter

m ok
creations-chat 2022-02-04 13:28:44 add coloured texts such as ⚠️
creations-chat 2022-02-04 13:31:12 what how when

oh ok np
creations-chat 2022-02-04 17:36:00 Apart from that green i like it
creations-chat 2022-02-04 17:38:02 What hes trying to say is that the front of the vehicle looks seperated in the reference pic above whereas in yours its just a straight cuboid hull 

Aka the vehicles looks like 2 parts connected with an inter section but thats not visible on yours
creations-chat 2022-02-04 17:40:05 First do all details and finish the build then think of colour bc you can simply use shades of the primary colour for the minor details so first finish it
creations-chat 2022-02-04 17:44:07 Oh ok i see also i think you have the right amount of wheels do you? Bc the 8th one looks fallen 
Id recommend adding smaller details to enhance the look like trails texts emojis and stuff also add detail to wheels using texts and make them default instead of fabric 
Lastly make the frint section smaller than rear one or conversely make the rear section height higher than front one bc its on the reference but yours is not correct
creations-chat 2022-02-04 17:46:59 Ok nice no problem!
And about the sled part you can try smthng like making wheels 2 wide such that the inner cylinder is fabric but outer is default for looks
creations-chat 2022-02-04 17:49:06 I see but can you show front of wheels and how they are made and how wide they are
creations-chat 2022-02-04 17:51:37 As i can see they are 2 wide so make the outer layer of each wheel default and add details on them
Keep inmer layer fabric for grip

Lol its ok just colour the motor
creations-chat 2022-02-04 17:54:46 Wow thanks man i mean ive never given much feedback here and <@719168864705052802> gives actual feedback too but his way is a bit harsh than me so depends on how you take it but he usually uses garbage if it needs major fixing and shit if minor required 
But atleast i helped you . Keep building !
creations-chat 2022-02-04 17:58:19 Well i said "usually" so maybe im wrong correct me if i am
creations-chat 2022-02-04 18:00:32 Ah ok well you got a point but according to what ive noticed i said that
creations-chat 2022-02-04 18:13:21 Yes very nice make their colour same as body 
OR
Make their material same as body so that when you copy colour off of body it remains automatically same and will not make them stand out from body but as a part of it
creations-chat 2022-02-04 18:25:13 Lma this joke was better
creations-chat 2022-02-05 06:42:43 <@839451762205392897> aye its you from the boxne server i met you nice mig 25 ,ready for a detailed feedback?
help 2022-02-05 06:59:39 Whats this
help 2022-02-05 07:10:55 lmfao
creations-chat 2022-02-05 08:43:46 mk later tho
creations-chat 2022-02-05 08:51:54 <@!839451762205392897> ok so here it is
the colour could be grey as in the original rather than white but its personal choice
you can use star symbols on signs for rudder rather than colouring a red square same for wing stars
the overall body could get small touches of details and there could be small colour details 
other than that 👍
creations-chat 2022-02-05 08:54:14 np

creations-chat 2022-02-21 15:21:08 There doesnt need to be an angle on front necessarily since i think its a catapult launched one
creations-chat 2022-02-21 15:23:12 Wait did you mean the front section's sides are angled? I thought you meant the ramp for jets to like get a lift like in hms queen elizabeth

<@!719168864705052802> how's panther
creations-chat 2022-02-22 12:21:03 i wonder if i could not have used motor lock to make it <:WhatChamp:775044367022555166>

<@!719168864705052802> cupola needs one more tiny detail so you got there right but it looks bad since its all grey i have more details on it when seen from front

and about exhausts its because these are additional exhaust extensions found on later panther gs , previous models had tiny tubes that were close to body but these didnt 
but thanks for pointing out
creations-chat 2022-02-22 12:25:47 the tiny dots are individually placed wing lights and trails are... trails 
also i know what you are talkign about i tried to implement that accidental useless irl shape detail but would be worthless so didnt care
creations-chat 2022-02-22 12:28:17 you mean these right?

its ok go take a sleep, there's much more to come so its not that useful to critique so hard on it rn
creations-chat 2022-02-22 12:30:58 hm ok ty tho btw i got a wierd explanation for that but uh the turret sides are single piece angle locked pieces and the rear curve is triangle wedges so i cant do the wing panel thing :(( but still ok

bot-central 2022-03-27 10:06:22 ?shelp
creations-chat 2022-03-27 15:37:53 Your progress is so slow

Mainly because you're trying to get every pixel in the blueprint to match using so much motorlock even tho no one would even notice and even if it's for personal satisfaction ,it's too much unnecessary lock and many parts can be done with regular blocks
creations-chat 2022-03-27 15:58:16 <@455104369180803082> i like your concept ,pretty unique and never seen before love the mechanism you used to counter the top load and keep it stable as if the gyros are generating lift 
What you shouls have done is that you ahould not colour it in an attempt to make it look good and instead make it look white and default block colours and say "anchorless stability gyro concept" because the community doesnt work the other way 
Go with my way and hundreds of upvotes
You can look at previous mechanism concept posts by other people to see what i mean
creations-chat 2022-03-27 16:01:24 I can understand why you coloured it but by colour white i meant not literally colour white but just place blocks and  dont change their colours e.g motors and and trails and other blocks keep their original colours
creations-chat 2022-03-27 16:03:31 No you wont be warned just delete the current one and post the new one but thiz time do a proper description explaining the mechanism

contest-chat 2022-03-31 15:49:09 cya
contest-chat 2022-03-31 17:17:55 Ngl there are many factors that the answer depends on
1)your device : the more 💪 your device (which mine is not )the less the lag, so i get around like 20 or 15 fps
2) at this point im just used to 10 fps because of my bad device so doesnt seem bad to me
3) but i have noticed that the tank when driving doesnt feel too slow or sluggish
contest-chat 2022-03-31 17:19:14 Thanks!
Also yea i was thinking about the length too 
Most probably its a block too short like overall but since i built it corresponding to the vehicle the problem might be in vehicle length (aka the length of the rear base the flak is fixed on)
contest-chat 2022-03-31 17:19:34 Also when did the votes come?

creations-chat 2022-04-06 14:55:48 <@410992368494575626> dont mind but....

Fuselage = 95% effort
Wings and other parts = 5% effort
creations-chat 2022-04-06 15:06:20 you put all the effort into angle locking several layers to make that cylindrical fuselage yet you didnt put much effort into fixing wing shapes and the holes in them and those elevators and vertical stabs are just too small to have any meaning
creations-chat 2022-04-06 15:13:05 hm i see maybe your wing shape is intentional to resemble bird wings so the small stabs make sense
creations-chat 2022-04-06 15:17:11 you can just motor lock wing panel inthe area to fill the hole
creations-chat 2022-04-06 17:21:15 Anybody want feedback? Im bored
creations-chat 2022-04-07 14:27:26 Real one has 6 road wheels 2 on each bogie but you got 5

F, try to bring them closer to make space for one more
creations-chat 2022-04-07 14:32:51 Shut up hars wannabe 
Hes doing good so far and considering he hasnt made much tanks before so he doesnt have much experience with the locking techniques and pattern and that "flat front plate" is actually flat . After killing a few of em in war thunder i can confirm its flat
 And you dumbass you are crying over that hull front vut couldnt consider pointing out the manlet,its supposed to be flat too but his is round and more of a panther style manlet

Sorry for being rude but i cant get over such people trying to cry over others just to have an impact while they themselves cant get things working
creations-chat 2022-04-07 14:35:33 Tbh i found that guy pretty nice he didnt curse much tho did downvote a lot but after wards he got fixed
creations-chat 2022-04-07 14:37:55 Not saying its accurate but its not that bad to start crying
creations-chat 2022-04-07 14:40:53 <@668314196764655618> try to fix the manlet ,its not supposed to be round but is flat

creations-chat 2022-04-09 14:18:31 I feel no shame in upvoting smtng i like but others dont
creations-chat 2022-04-09 16:20:59 Its not their fault that there are shit builds in <#384025409945337856> rn its because there are more inexperienced members in pcc recently and them posting shit builds is because well pbviously they dont have that level of skill yet , you cant always expect 100+ upvote builds on there all time 

Hope that explains
contest-chat 2022-04-09 16:25:03 <@934150235435958283> Modified client!!??! 😱
creations-chat 2022-04-09 16:26:07 Juicy
creations-chat 2022-04-09 16:28:53 The reason is the enormous number of public players that joined pcc recently so the low skill is expected but with time we can expect increase in quality or increase it ourselves by helping them increase it
creations-chat 2022-04-09 16:32:24 ||ok lets to on mass murder||

creations-chat 2023-02-04 09:42:26 My build is like a year old by now i think.
Im not being toxic or proudy but he cant compete with it even being old

One of the reasons being the barrel. Mine uses a trick to remove sparkler bases while his is rough.
Tho i do encourage him to try to beat me
creations-chat 2023-02-04 09:44:47 Thanks , intent was not to flex ,but to give HiAmnew an idea of how to do it
creations-chat 2023-02-04 09:48:44 You're new, its a tnt trick

creations-chat 2023-02-07 06:10:29 <@984694509772357662> upvote for effort and details , downvote for messy look and the rotor blades
creations-chat 2023-02-07 16:19:05 <@892688032824713226> youre just getting our religion made fun of , so no need to explain it all and shit , change your bio and stay related to the topic aka plane crazy
creations-chat 2023-02-08 09:56:02 No need to add "fucking" makes you sound like a crapass dumb toxic player who himself never has the experience

Its ok , be careful next time
creations-chat 2023-02-08 09:58:37 Need context

It means, explain what youre trying to show us. Aka what is that you need tips on
creations-chat 2023-02-08 10:01:48 What is the thing youre showing in the pic, is it a wing or what, give some background so we get a better idea

creations-chat 2023-02-08 14:02:37 I was just wondering, thats why i downvoted it. Maybe you should report to mods
creations-chat 2023-02-08 16:34:18 <@652968737485357056> honestly, impressive
creations-chat 2023-02-09 11:49:12 Fear me <:trollface:775024642104229898>
creations-chat 2023-02-09 12:32:36 <@883063424614006878> i got a point to support you .
Su57s physical design was never claimed to be the source of its stealth , the design and shape is just for excellent aerodynamic purpose.
The stealth is achieved through the many sensors hidden around the aircraft and if i remember correctly, theres a sensor to mimic the stealth , instead of adding a whole coat of stealth material on the jet idk wtf the Americans call it
creations-chat 2023-02-09 12:37:41 Eh , practically su57 has seen more combat and is approved than the only balloon kill of an f22
creations-chat 2023-02-09 12:40:07 Lmao , you cant call that a kill but whatever, the felons have been used in ukraine and western media does agree with that
creations-chat 2023-02-09 12:43:13 Tbh the topic is gonna just end into political stuff and whatnot, how about we agree that f22 is overrated and overbuilt and felon looks cool

Indeed but every new pc player is making an f22 while felons ive not much seen
creations-chat 2023-02-09 12:46:01 Best jet in the world ever
!!
!!!
!
creations-chat 2023-02-09 12:48:48 Prototypes = *exist*
American media = "Look russian plane so bad it made of paper actually and glued together with tape!!!"

creations-chat 2023-02-10 13:49:09 ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
creations-chat 2023-02-10 14:02:51 Nein
Plus that t90 deserves more upvotes
creations-chat 2023-02-10 15:17:13 Thats a ridiculous reason, none makes sense.
Its not even close to overbuilt
Its not overated , just the shtora is, t72s are more overrated

creations-chat 2023-02-12 01:42:28 Can barely see the tank
creations-chat 2023-02-12 01:44:35 This is what happens when you dont keep a balance between looks and functionality
creations-chat 2023-02-12 07:00:30 You could apply for hof considering pcc's standards now a days. But it wouldnt pass tho it looks epic
creations-chat 2023-02-12 07:13:04 Eh don't try , youll not pass. Just know that its amazing
creations-chat 2023-02-12 07:19:49 Ok thats a bit too much... Not hof
creations-chat 2023-02-12 08:12:31 <@438492646311329794> so basically a rod , not sure how you make it move since i cant see in the image can you take your time to get some higher quality pics please?
creations-chat 2023-02-12 08:15:33 ah so it doesnt have propulsion in itself , it has a ballistic flight
creations-chat 2023-02-12 08:43:52 <:stuff:908917207986208828>
creations-chat 2023-02-12 08:45:56 Maybe a propeller would work since jet engines and rockets are too big

creations-chat 2023-02-12 16:53:44 The area in red could be fixed by locking the entire panel into the gap with the gaps being normal wings instead of control surfaces , so when it comes down there's no gap, the area in green can be filled with a triangle wedge (sorry for late reply)

creations-chat 2023-02-13 05:26:27 Its fine most people dont , try watching "Redacted" on yt , independent news reporters
creations-chat 2023-02-13 05:32:20 Every vid is important soo... , Id recommend watching latest ones then slowly making your way down
creations-chat 2023-02-13 06:32:55 Its epic , yes.
Deserves hof , no.
Emoji spam doesnt make things hof worthy
creations-chat 2023-02-13 06:51:22 Love how people add motorlock to add their beloved "cylinder canopy" just to ruin the rest of the build with the exposed lock they added

creations-chat 2023-02-13 07:20:23 Wdym , theres a lot of criteria to pass for hof
creations-chat 2023-02-13 07:29:45 Yea , but doesn't make it hof worthy
Yes i have got hof , but mainly its up to the hof voters to decide
If we were to base hof criteria for only upvote downvote ratio then almost anything would be in hof
creations-chat 2023-02-13 07:33:36 Yea no , sorry but no.
I didnt set the rules , ask them who did but i can assure you that stuff wont pass hof voting
creations-chat 2023-02-13 07:40:11 No 😭

<@815906861131235409> reason for engines being like that is they have thrust vector
Reasoj for canopy is that it has an interior
creations-chat 2023-03-26 16:41:17 Thanks , its actually a year or more old build. I just added this paintjob a few months ago
creations-chat 2023-03-26 17:02:31 I mean its kinda good in certain aspects
creations-chat 2023-03-26 17:05:09 Its a "custom" a10 😁
creations-chat 2023-03-27 14:34:16 might get warned for that... but ship is amazing
creations-chat 2023-03-27 14:50:54 ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ i forgot to ask whiz for taking those pics
creations-chat 2023-03-27 15:27:31 im taking pics
creations-chat 2023-03-27 15:39:47 got a better explanation pls? im not sure what you mean by su35'ing
creations-chat 2023-03-27 15:42:30 idk how the wings could get more su-35ish 😭  theyre literally just delta wings
creations-chat 2023-03-27 15:44:38 maybe this might help
creations-chat 2023-03-27 15:47:02 it was just cam angle , but its fine no ones to be blamed
creations-chat 2023-03-27 15:49:54 interior was a last minute addition and its a 1 wide area inside so...
creations-chat 2023-03-27 15:53:14 definitely , but id not bother do
creations-chat 2023-03-27 15:58:16 ngl thats cool
creations-chat 2023-03-27 16:05:26 the jet can barely roll
creations-chat 2023-03-27 16:08:49 its so big it cant pvp at all
creations-chat 2023-03-27 16:10:51 sparkler
creations-chat 2023-03-27 16:33:18 the gears rotate and fit in

creations-chat 2023-03-27 18:19:22 I did take pics without and looked good but i wanted details to pop out so used shader

creations-chat 2023-03-28 15:29:43 Thank you,fine gentleman.
creations-chat 2023-03-29 13:50:27 ver nice , tho looks more like a t72b3
consider lengthening the turret era panels to make it a bvm
creations-chat 2023-03-29 14:15:10 thats what i said , yes
creations-chat 2023-03-29 14:17:17 still way too short , try 1x2 instead of 1x1
creations-chat 2023-03-29 14:30:21 would atleast make it less like a t72b3

Also all views aside, remove the flags cuz they look odd on the paintjob of the vehicle so they ruin it. The one on the top is acceptable but the one painted on is just bad
creations-chat 2023-04-14 15:13:07 Eh but ingame the flag there doesnt look good , any flag wouldnt
creations-chat 2023-04-14 15:31:18 Okay..
creations-chat 2023-04-15 16:11:12 <@577142983850197002> quite acceptable , but couldve added tracks to finish it off

creations-chat 2023-04-25 13:37:31 <@1050590146631839754> shaders dont change the fact that the build is bad
creations-chat 2023-04-25 13:40:44 well thats your opinion , the fact is removing the shaders will prove you otherwise
creations-chat 2023-04-25 13:43:14 ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
creations-chat 2023-05-03 07:28:01 <@793887766022455316> why do i see Zimmerit on the abrams rear
creations-chat 2023-05-03 07:32:49 The engine deck , the rear area near the exhaust vent
creations-chat 2023-05-03 07:36:05 Dont add these random signs to make "details" theyre cleaner irl than people tend to make in game
creations-chat 2023-05-06 10:21:22 <@1004207882784489472> didnt know you could build <:stuff:908917207986208828>
the-dump 2023-05-07 05:22:20 But i don't like too much era , i like composite
creations-chat 2023-05-10 07:35:25 <@922383236590620703> very nice actually, only lacks tracks. Even if they are fake tracks they will make a difference. Also does mantlet rotate? If yes then upvote
creations-chat 2023-05-11 13:19:56 You bastard how dare you be rude to the mighty and the legendary, the one and the only <@757887014388367401> ?!?!?!

creations-chat 2023-05-12 07:02:05 <@753767259096219749> would look 45% better if details such as rubber fenders had been coloured
T72 i mean
creations-chat 2023-05-12 15:08:41 doesnt mean you keep it that way , it looks bland if you keep it a single colour and ingame is not real life...
plus theres only a few such examples with a single tone colour , the rest are all with black fenders
creations-chat 2023-05-12 15:11:21 i would not recommend a camo , from my experience it will make it look clustered. rather keep it a single colour with coloured details and put as much detail as possible , but goodluck on t80
creations-chat 2023-05-16 06:25:39 <@1072198954726477915> honestly i like that ka50

creations-chat 2023-05-19 08:19:39 Dont add motor2 for the nozzle rotation, they glitch out. Use a normal motor with lock function on
creations-chat 2023-05-19 14:13:45 You rotate it manually with the locker motor
creations-chat 2023-05-24 11:25:17 <@753767259096219749> nice but there need to be 6 roadwheels , not 5 . also wheres the idler and sprocket wheels?
creations-chat 2023-05-24 11:36:03 no tracks = not that good
creations-chat 2023-05-24 11:38:13 1. fake tracks exist 
2. he could make 2 wide tracks , the "thin (trapdoor) tracks" , by spacing the side skirts by a piston .1 so there's no "friction"
creations-chat 2023-05-24 11:41:58 i do like the build, no need to rage over my opinion. its just that it could be way better if there were tracks , even non functional ones would work
creations-chat 2023-05-24 11:46:53 its not gonna pvp or anything , its just a model. driving would matter if it had to pvp so the fake tracks would only add to the looksince they dont need a function.
working tracks are pain to add but definitely worth it , ive built them myself just check my t14 armata its almost the same scale
creations-chat 2023-05-24 11:48:56 im just giving an advice ,not like i hate the build cuz it doesnt have the tracks. yall get annoyed over just a suggestion guh
creations-chat 2023-05-24 12:00:52 his wheels are already 2 wide look closely
creations-chat 2023-05-24 12:02:55 oh my god y'all must be ganging up on me, just look at this , he doesnt add tracks idfc but all im saying it is possible to add
creations-chat 2023-05-24 14:00:32 Are you making the t80u or a t72b3
creations-chat 2023-05-24 14:29:56 What variant of t80
creations-chat 2023-05-24 15:00:42 The normal t80 looks like a t72a , im guessing by the era on the turret front that youre making a t80u
creations-chat 2023-05-24 17:54:10 Torque detail? Wdym by that
creations-chat 2023-06-10 11:01:22 😂
creations-chat 2023-06-19 18:53:03 Probably the transition between the 1st delta wing and the main wing could get some work
creations-chat 2023-06-19 18:55:55 the edge is not complete round , its sharp but smooth
creations-chat 2023-06-19 19:00:30 a Google search would have helped
creations-chat 2023-06-19 19:26:20 The engine placement and wing shape clearly suggests its a mig 29, so its a mig-29ub , not an su-27ub thats for sure
creations-chat 2023-06-19 19:28:23 No ,its not merged designs. Its one plane , but with the others name
