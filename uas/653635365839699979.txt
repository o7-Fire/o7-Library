creations-chat 2022-02-17 19:29:00 True true
creations-chat 2023-02-01 20:27:19 what did i even do bruh
creations-chat 2023-02-01 20:40:34 wow look at that
creations-chat 2023-02-01 20:42:59 pinging me just to be a wannabe mod, using the skull emoji and directing a swear at me
lol
creations-chat 2023-02-01 20:47:48 real real
creations-chat 2023-02-01 20:50:24 bro ran out of arguments, also thx everyone who supports me in this stupid debate
creations-chat 2023-02-01 20:52:26 im gonna remind you about this again, maybe you forgot about it
creations-chat 2023-02-01 20:55:17 tfw i cant even post a reference photo for something i am working hard on without you people getting sensitive about it, chronically online behaveor
also i deleted it after gam3r pinged me, just thought it was unnecesarily toxic
creations-chat 2023-02-01 20:57:20 ok so rules are not important when it comes to you but when it comes to me who has been in this server for a mere month and wanted to show something, it is important enough to cry and argue over it
ok
creations-chat 2023-02-01 20:59:24 i would because i wouldnt have to argue with children, and mods are prolly nicer than you<:stuff:908917207986208828>
creations-chat 2023-02-01 21:01:27 they broke the rules while telling me i broke the rules in a toxic sentence, just thought it was ironic, also i fixed up my mistake because i am like tony stark (he always learns from his mistakes)<:stuff:908917207986208828> <:stuff:908917207986208828> <:stuff:908917207986208828>
creations-chat 2023-02-01 21:05:10 i like how one tiny rule being broken is all this server needs to unhinge into total chaos
creations-chat 2023-02-01 21:07:11 i did but ok
creations-chat 2023-02-01 21:10:02 mad?
creations-chat 2023-02-01 21:12:57 because i am more important aparently, ik im in the wrong i have fixed my mistakes people
creations-chat 2023-02-01 21:15:00 im 14
W koczi
why do you keep moving the trollface
creations-chat 2023-02-01 21:18:17 ok so i broke 2 rules, the first one being no WIPs in creations, and second being no references
i have deleted both images from the creations chat and have told you that i am in the wrong
i accept that what i have done
why is this so godawful to you
creations-chat 2023-02-01 21:20:22 just check me idfc i am not underage
creations-chat 2023-02-01 21:22:32 thank you sock
creations-chat 2023-02-01 21:24:34 ik but i wasnt the only asshole in the chat, why does everyone think i think of myself as perfect
creations-chat 2023-02-01 21:27:16 i will post the black mesa in the creations channel when it is done with no references
done
creations-chat 2023-03-16 20:20:34 tfw <#384025409945337856> is locked
