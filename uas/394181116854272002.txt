bug-reports 2019-12-02 06:16:54 Not a bug report sorry about typing here but a way to fix motor twos flinging issue if you have a multi jointed build is put mutiple anchor blocks then unachor them one at a time
bug-reports 2019-12-02 06:17:36 In each section of the build of course
bug-reports 2019-12-03 00:02:32 <@456226577798135808> put a anchor block in each section of the boat then slowly release each one, it wont complelty stop the fling effect but it probably will let you use your boat again
bug-reports 2019-12-03 00:30:20 Hm sorry i could not be of more help, its just what i did to stop my mech from flying away.
bug-reports 2019-12-07 08:44:53 This game is slowly destroying itself trying to fix itself

creations-chat 2021-01-15 21:54:44 dang beat me to it
creations-chat 2021-01-15 21:57:18 then you must make it EVEN TALLER
creations-chat 2021-01-15 22:03:22 i made a transforming wheel spider, due to it scraping across the ground when it walked and getting disfigured i tried to reset the motors  but somehow the motors can't find out where they started, so it just dances
creations-chat 2021-01-15 22:05:24 Got to love motors huh?
creations-chat 2021-01-15 22:07:45 i thought so to (might still be the case), but i just kept working with the motors and no matter what i did, the type of movement i use just breaks it and quickly turns it into a tornado of legs
creations-chat 2021-01-15 22:09:47 anyway this is the wrong chat to talk about this
creations-chat 2021-02-01 00:43:07 i love it, but i bet it walks like soggy noodle
creations-chat 2021-02-02 16:41:27 i saw other people do similar to show of their builds angles?
creations-chat 2021-02-02 16:43:28 sorry though, just wanted to show off what i had
creations-chat 2021-02-02 16:54:36 you can really make it as small or large as you want, but yea i would say so
creations-chat 2021-02-02 16:57:10 btw im open to criticism on my build, so feel free to tell me whats wrong with it XD or what to add (just keep in mind it still a work in progress)
creations-chat 2021-02-02 17:00:53 gonna sound like a broken record but any opinion on mine? or is it also just the color
creations-chat 2021-02-02 17:04:36 dang, people dont take opinions very well, is just game why you mad
creations-chat 2021-02-10 05:06:18 any thoughts on my warehouse/hanger build?
creations-chat 2021-02-10 05:08:30 <@!740641695783321670>  yea i do, its mostly flat right now but i can show you what i have
creations-chat 2021-02-10 05:16:30 <@!740641695783321670> alright there you go
creations-chat 2021-02-10 05:21:14 and if you want a proper size reference (since i did not really put any good ones in any other photos), the first one with the small white lad in front is me, just for better scale
creations-chat 2021-02-10 05:23:29 and yea <@!757887014388367401>  it looks great, i just feel like the sails should be a bit more rounded, apart from that everything looks perfect
creations-chat 2021-02-10 05:26:01 np mah bro
creations-chat 2021-02-10 15:24:16 Indeed perhaps motor locking/more motor locking could do the trick
creations-chat 2021-04-02 23:19:14 man looking at the pictures i am now realizing that there might be TO much detail on the inside...
creations-chat 2021-11-27 21:06:04 Someone else made a minigun with trails for the barrels so i decided to give it a go myself, how does it look?
creations-chat 2021-11-27 21:08:33 ah like in the middle?
creations-chat 2021-11-27 21:11:33 his design uses pistons facing outwards, mine go inwards, its exactly one block smaller (with the trails being the extra block)
creations-chat 2021-11-27 21:13:37 actually maybe its almost exactly the same in height  and width thinking about it? his pistons are more compressed i forgot about that
creations-chat 2021-11-27 21:34:14 sorry it took a while to change due to some voodo things going on with my camera's this better?
creations-chat 2021-11-27 21:36:31 i was about to say, i dont come here often but when i do everyone is just pretty much yelling at each other
creations-chat 2021-11-27 21:38:42 okay ahem, now my turn to burn, i got 8 downvotes on my build what can i fix/change?
creations-chat 2021-11-27 21:40:58 ight, the center barrel is already there though (or whatever you call that....support)
creations-chat 2021-11-27 21:44:13 i did not build it based off anything <@!698587744842022983> just a generic minigun
creations-chat 2021-11-27 21:52:04 why hello
creations-chat 2021-11-27 21:55:58 i know that much at least, and i was thinking about doing that but just decided to just wing it
creations-chat 2021-11-27 22:00:52 thats alright <@!705533053740777584> it does not exactly have to be accurate to a real life minigun
creations-chat 2021-11-27 22:03:56 alright, i don't know my guns so ill just do that.
