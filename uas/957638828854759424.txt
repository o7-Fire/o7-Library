help 2023-01-28 15:46:04 ehh people recommend to make a blueprint of russian modern tank or well find a tank that looks easy to build, and search 3D model, if u good at drawing make a blueprint version of it
help 2023-01-28 15:48:05 alright go ahead, gl building it
help 2023-01-28 15:57:08 hmm i think u need to try change the wing panel onto the custom one which uses motor2
help 2023-01-28 15:57:58 i'll send a video of me making that
help 2023-01-28 15:57:59 hold on
help 2023-01-28 15:58:24 make it heavier
help 2023-01-28 15:59:01 its probably on the front area is too heavy, try to make it less heavy by put some helium in it
help 2023-01-28 15:59:11 this is the only way i can think of
help 2023-01-28 16:00:49 well cant help u i guess
help 2023-01-28 16:01:32 okay anyways i cant make a video bc its only lagging me in the end, so i'll send multiple pictures instead
help 2023-01-28 16:02:21 but may i ask how long and how wide is your wing? (EXAMPLE : 3x5 (3 is for the long) (5 is for the wide)
help 2023-01-28 16:03:06 just put 1 helium, and if its not enough try to combine bassalt instead
help 2023-01-28 16:04:18 hm okay let me copy the wings first
help 2023-01-28 16:06:26 is ur wing like this??
help 2023-01-28 16:06:44 ok let me try to make the customized version
help 2023-01-28 16:07:14 np, but beastslayer did most of it
help 2023-01-28 16:14:59 try this i guess i didnt really make it clean bc i have no idea tbh so im sorry about that also u can edit motor2 settings and try which angle fits perfectly (i didnt edit the motor2)
help 2023-01-28 16:15:45 yeah np
help 2023-01-28 16:16:16 also reminder, keep the wing panels "set control automaticly" off
