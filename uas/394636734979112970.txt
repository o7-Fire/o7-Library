The Tale of aftiredburner (394636734979112970)
creations-chat 2020-12-21 17:56:37 i did. it took a lot of time to make all the curves and functions the way they are and keep it to its original design. but come to think of it i am working on something else... bigger...
creations-chat 2020-12-23 23:51:20 seems a bit slim
creations-chat 2020-12-24 00:03:25 i really agree, sometimes builds get judged by size or by detail a lot
creations-chat 2020-12-24 19:13:36 bruh why is this getting downvoted. i know its a bigger version of another mech he made but what the hell man, this look some EFFORT.
creations-chat 2020-12-24 19:17:01 even a mini atat is doing better. and that is around 230 block (still a good build tho)
creations-chat 2020-12-24 19:19:11 i know but still its confusing to me how it happens. i mean, how much "effort" does it take to satisfy the people in creations?
creations-chat 2020-12-25 20:20:15 how would i be if i make a glock :/
creations-chat 2020-12-26 05:20:11 what if i posted a custom tie fighter that goes over 2k 

the catch: its small
creations-chat 2020-12-26 05:22:28 oh my god...
creations-chat 2020-12-26 05:24:31 b i g b o a t
creations-chat 2020-12-26 05:32:03 dang boi, dang boi, DANG BOI HE THICC
creations-chat 2020-12-26 07:45:42 should i make a tim burton/michael keaton batmobile that can turn into the bat missile? (motorlocked to hide the disconnecters)
creations-chat 2020-12-26 07:47:47 and please tell me if i should make it to scale or bigger to fit more details i need ideas and recommendations bcus i have have a few throwaway builds i dont want nor need
creations-chat 2020-12-26 07:52:46 got it. gonna start tomorrow since: 

1. i need to sleep

2. i just finished a long event item quest

3. because i am lazy

- so expect that to come in a few days of work (if i am in the mood)
creations-chat 2020-12-26 07:54:50 oki ima sleep now and dream of ideas so yeah, bai :/
creations-chat 2020-12-26 08:05:41 one last check before i wander into the dream world but it looks really good! smooth tank!
creations-chat 2020-12-26 18:06:15 ok so the original picture i was using for a reference was wrong as the wheels FROM the shell actually SHRINK into the batmissile and the ACTUAL look is THIS (ik its a wheel but trust me)
creations-chat 2020-12-26 18:09:54 its just saying that the original pic i used was inaccurate and i care about the SMALLEST details as i dont wanna miss anything
creations-chat 2020-12-26 18:12:36 i would say atleast around 400 for the bat missile alone as it takes a lot to satisfy the people in creations but we'll see
creations-chat 2020-12-26 20:46:04 finished the batmissile, what do you think? (note: i ONLY finished the BATMISSILE and not the shell which are the outer wheels)
creations-chat 2020-12-26 20:48:11 got it, gona do dat right now
creations-chat 2020-12-26 20:50:57 okay i see it now,  i think i need to make the back of the cockpit more streamlined with the back and the front has a really big tip when the actual one is not so big so thanks for the feedback!
creations-chat 2020-12-26 21:17:45 pretty big already (if you are making a bigger version you might need to make it fold)
creations-chat 2020-12-26 21:20:49 sure
creations-chat 2020-12-26 21:41:33 any recommendations oh how to make it smoother (the middle)
creations-chat 2020-12-27 01:26:43 so i finished the batmobile shell within 3 hours of work, still needs improvements, gonna take a small break rn (screenshots come a bit later)
creations-chat 2020-12-27 02:15:26 it starts big and gets smaller :/
creations-chat 2020-12-27 17:34:40 looks goood  so far
creations-chat 2020-12-27 17:47:38 so i have a question. so i added concealed machine guns to my batmobile and plan to make an expanding cockpit but i dont know if i should do so. should i? (and keep in mind a already posted the former version which is the one without those)
creations-chat 2020-12-27 17:50:30 uhhh oki i guess :/
creations-chat 2020-12-27 17:52:40 uhh the keaton mobile not adam west :/ (and yes i did make that)
creations-chat 2020-12-27 17:54:51 got it, gonna fix that later :/
creations-chat 2020-12-27 18:04:27 i mean, the actual one doesnt really have much detail either tho :/ (although i wil make the concealed machinegun covers a bit like the car)
creations-chat 2020-12-27 18:14:53 i wouldnt suggest most mini creations as people see them as crappy low effort builds instead of actual work as sometimes (key word: SOMETIMES) they are low effort, no sweat builds. so yea, wouldnt recommend that
creations-chat 2020-12-27 21:24:59 he is the ENGINE-er
creations-chat 2020-12-28 08:26:11 W A T
creations-chat 2020-12-28 08:45:40 making a full auto rifle. got the mag and extractor done. any suggestions for what that rifle will be? (how ironic considering rifle ins IN my user lol)
creations-chat 2020-12-28 08:47:56 sure (m4 or ak was the first idea that came to mind when i was making it)
creations-chat 2020-12-28 08:49:59 havent made one for the p90 style mags yet, great idea not gonna lie, probably in the future when i know/ come up with an idea on how to make one
creations-chat 2020-12-28 08:52:14 too complex for my brain ;-; anyway gonna go to bed soon :/
creations-chat 2020-12-28 18:35:50 <@!453015366281723905> i think it looks like a lockheed 117 night hawk
creations-chat 2020-12-28 18:38:52 from how i see it as i now as i looked harder i see it  as nighthawk midsection (cockpit) in the b2 wing system/shape.
creations-chat 2020-12-29 04:15:12 should  i post an undertale themed boss battle i made
creations-chat 2020-12-29 04:17:31 i really want your opinions on this
creations-chat 2020-12-29 04:22:18 okay, let me get a few screenshots and see what happpens
creations-chat 2020-12-29 23:31:08 should i try to make a galloping horse? ( i am obsessed with jjba steel ball run rn which is a part based around a horse race set in 1901. and if i DO make a galloping horse who tell me who should be the rider whether it be funny valentine, diego, gyro, or johnny or whoever :/)
creations-chat 2020-12-29 23:58:23 who do yall want to be the rider (anyone but nothing absurd like a horse riding a horse. this is a genuine thing i want to do)
creations-chat 2020-12-30 00:44:16 r/ihadastroke
creations-chat 2020-12-30 00:55:36 what plane cockpit is it?
creations-chat 2020-12-30 01:05:29 did you motorlock parts in parts? (like parts stuck in other parts)
creations-chat 2020-12-30 01:07:59 any way you can remove the jammed/glitched parts without losing too much detail? (such as inside the cocpit)
creations-chat 2020-12-30 01:10:14 hmm...
creations-chat 2020-12-30 01:12:19 any blocks that arent nessasary? and dryreborn that is a word you should NEVER use as it is VERY offensive
creations-chat 2020-12-30 01:26:00 probably bcus the mechs are more popular and tbh i didnt know about the ships until you mentioned it
creations-chat 2020-12-30 01:28:20 yeah, from what i see the ships have a TON of detail and the ships look very time consuming to model and deserve more respect than the mechs themselves. not to hate on the mechs but they are literally balls with arms and legs
creations-chat 2020-12-30 01:31:23 can you take a screenshot from your computer instead? its hard to see the blocks you used because of the effect that happens when you take a shot of a computer screen with a phone
creations-chat 2020-12-30 01:33:29 google: To capture your entire screen and automatically save the screenshot, tap the Windows key + Print Screen key. Your screen will briefly go dim to indicate that you've just taken a screenshot, and the screenshot will be saved to the Pictures > Screenshots folder

try that to see if it works, if it does then good, take a screenshot, gonna go do something else now, see ya in a bit.
creations-chat 2020-12-30 21:35:37 idk maybe ask the devs or something
creations-chat 2020-12-30 21:48:56 cockpit could use a bit of work but other than that looks great (here is a reference image)
creations-chat 2020-12-31 01:01:00 okay, i talked about making a galloping horse a day or 2 ago but once again who should be the rider?

johnny = nail shots

gyro = steel ball throw 

diego = knife throw

funny valentine = revolver

pick one i want to see which one you guys want
creations-chat 2020-12-31 01:09:50 so johnny is one of them,  might make another one, somebody else pick one out of valentine, gryo, or diego
creations-chat 2020-12-31 01:11:59 diego it is so ima get to working on the nail shots and knife throw along with the horse as i didnt want to start without a few riders
creations-chat 2020-12-31 01:14:08 bruh roblox is down again (website)

creations-chat 2021-01-02 05:39:38 so... update on the galloping horse: while i got the basic shape and galloping style for now its only going to be a motion statue. the rider is still being worked on.
creations-chat 2021-01-02 17:50:47 once again, the damn thing doesn't want to work with me while recording. i don't know why but it just doesn't.

creations-chat 2021-01-07 04:53:58 should i make wheel of fortune?
creations-chat 2021-01-07 04:58:50 anyone else want me to make it
creations-chat 2021-01-07 05:07:45 wheel of fortune it is
creations-chat 2021-01-07 06:57:11 first attempt at wheel of fortune. how does it look?
creations-chat 2021-01-07 06:59:24 i might make a better one later in the future but for now, this is my first attempt
creations-chat 2021-01-07 07:02:24 here is the stand stat thing pic. i couldnt find any images of the back so i just kinda did whatever.
creations-chat 2021-01-07 07:05:44 the hood being able to chomp? (the front two claws) that happened in the show, might add the gasoline shot thing, cutters for cutting but i need to go to bed soon bcus of class (i have a life sadly)
creations-chat 2021-01-07 07:22:48 adding the abilities to the wheel of fortune tomorrow. (climbing walls, gas spray thing, chomping, whatever) ima go to sleep soon bcus school also exists inside of a life and starts at the frickin crack of dawn.
creations-chat 2021-01-07 07:37:01 come to think of it i might as well just redo the entire fucking thing from scratch. the first attempt is a fail (gonna redo the entire thing tomorrow)
creations-chat 2021-01-07 16:38:56 uhhhh ok
creations-chat 2021-01-07 17:45:39 has anyone made soundwave yet?

creations-chat 2021-01-07 21:42:39 also if anyone has picture of the back of wheel of fortune then please send it as i could only find and use the pose image and some other reference photos
creations-chat 2021-01-07 21:46:49 true, that could be part of the wall climbing ability (cant do it at the moment bcus i have class)
creations-chat 2021-01-07 21:50:04 pretty unhappy with the side, gonna totally redo that later (the actual wheel of fortune has a rounder wheel well thing)

creations-chat 2021-01-08 20:32:26 those are the back lights and headlights which is used on most vehicles
creations-chat 2021-01-08 20:49:32 yea same here lol the front fits with the thing pretty well
creations-chat 2021-01-09 18:14:03 its connected to terrible history which many people hate (the cross of you know what)
creations-chat 2021-01-09 18:16:43 anyone got any recommendations for ideas (i am out of them)

creations-chat 2021-01-12 01:05:29 everyone gets better :/
creations-chat 2021-01-12 16:13:38 **bottom text here**
creations-chat 2021-01-12 16:36:21 tbh the plane looks good but the suspension and blocky turbines might be why people dont like it :/
creations-chat 2021-01-12 16:42:27 why :/
bug-reports 2021-01-14 20:31:43 it does that. just wait to load in and you should be fine. also that part of the map is where you spawn, then the game quickly teleports you to your plot. tools also take a bit to load in
creations-chat 2021-01-16 01:47:43 how do i improve this? (arkham knight batmobile)
creations-chat 2021-01-18 01:41:36 i made one before and just hated it and so i made a turbine. then after leaving it alone for a few days i finally wanted to finish it. too an hour to make half of it (wing panels and the edge of the body), second hour to finish the other half and 20 mins making the shell and the rest on the paintjob and the cockpit. im a fast worker and that is the time it took. yup, 3 hours to make it starting from the turbine. and the turbine was just a small part taking around a minute and a half. if you are still in disbelief then let me tell you that i basically used speed to overpower weight and the control surfaces (controlled by keys and are wing panels connected to motors) is what makes it so easy to lift off. the speed of the thing took no time at all since i always use hover engines for my faster jets and took a few seconds to fix.
creations-chat 2021-01-19 19:33:54 hmm, try putting cutters on disconnectors or motors. if that doesnt work then try ropes
creations-chat 2021-01-19 19:37:39 while suspension looks good, you cant rlly change the color of the blue spring tho... but it works
creations-chat 2021-01-19 19:52:33 pedsond is prob gonna get warned or somethin :/
creations-chat 2021-01-19 19:57:56 its the tutorial part thats the problem, pedsond said and posted "The Löwe Tank of Youtube Tutorial (Whit Rockets , Gun Elevation and Suspension)"
creations-chat 2021-01-19 20:18:08 they arent rlly dumb, they can improve builds and be used for magnetic engines, and if they dont go here you want them too couldnt you be bothered to make slots and tabs for them to go and lock where you want?
creations-chat 2021-01-19 20:22:32 short answer: magnets arent broken
creations-chat 2021-01-19 21:42:26 cursed beyond belief

bug-reports 2021-01-21 18:04:13 most of my builds use motor 2. ima just wait ;-;
creations-chat 2021-01-21 19:37:56 anyone tried this little shit yet
creations-chat 2021-01-21 19:40:11 hmmmmmmmmmm...
creations-chat 2021-01-21 19:50:31 i meant as in a monowheel bike thing that is actually fast and useable, not slow. (tbh i dont rlly blame ya bcus that is pretty much what came to my mind too :l)
creations-chat 2021-01-21 20:00:53 got any screenshots?
creations-chat 2021-01-21 20:03:03 top view?
creations-chat 2021-01-21 20:05:38 looks good but the back part looks rlly skinny, try using half blocks
creations-chat 2021-01-22 20:39:55 https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/384025409945337856/802272618882924596 <@!671311748573167616>  while there were versions of the sr71 that were armed the front wings kind of throw it off. you should try making bigger wing panels on the back by using motors and wing panels. other than that it looks good.
creations-chat 2021-01-22 20:46:56 its also confusing bcus some pictures show the blackbird with short turbines while others show it with long turbines lol
help 2021-01-22 20:56:51 anyone made an ironman suit that can generally doesnt look like crap

creations-chat 2021-01-23 02:05:12 how does this look for an iron man helmet (im making the darn thing)
creations-chat 2021-01-23 02:08:08 feel like the mask is too flat. whatever. ima worry about that later
creations-chat 2021-01-23 04:28:24 technically still counts as a tutorial as you are most likely making small adjustments to fit your style or to make it look better. the tutorial itself is no effort. editing it slightly (replacing wedges, small adjustments and improvements) would be horribly low effort. editing the system would take a slight (not much more since its just most likely just replacing motors, wings, control panels) bit more effort.
creations-chat 2021-01-23 04:33:40 ive seen people in game claiming its theirs even though basically 70-90% of the build is from the tutorial and 30-10% (rarely 30% is their own work when editing a tutorial) is the "improvements"
creations-chat 2021-01-23 04:46:44 but hey what do i know? i havent used many tutorials before!
creations-chat 2021-01-23 05:00:29 hm... the front seems a bit (maybe by a block or 2) too long. other than that looks good!
creations-chat 2021-01-24 18:32:13 anyone made a TRUE (yes the most TRUEST OF THEM ALL) knight in shining armour? (silver chariot)
creations-chat 2021-01-24 23:43:54 silver chariot :/ (might make a model that can actually sword fight and then make it a mech)
creations-chat 2021-01-24 23:50:08 btw any feed back on my irom man armour fly thing??? (the top thing helps with stability and turning) and yes this is the mark 2 and probably the basis of other suits. but as always, if people see improvements i will be welcome to add them
creations-chat 2021-01-24 23:58:02 back pic (the highlighted parts are control panels in the back and calfs for stabalization)
creations-chat 2021-01-25 07:50:40 what does it do?
creations-chat 2021-01-25 07:55:53 does it fly? move? hover?

creations-chat 2021-01-27 22:17:48 no its just that some people set their standards too high

creations-chat 2021-01-28 21:29:18 i think that tone of color is good since you can see where blocks are gonna be placed while not having a a black shape. kinda like this old post i made (its completely black and also this  is only an example not to show old stuff)
creations-chat 2021-01-28 21:40:29 that is beautiful. wish bob was here to see it.

creations-chat 2021-01-29 22:21:03 how so tho? tbh i dont see a difference
creations-chat 2021-01-29 22:23:08 so you basically added more rope? :/
creations-chat 2021-01-29 22:27:25 still wondering why you basically copied the entire thing with a few small changes tho (the suspension system is basically 1:1)
creations-chat 2021-01-29 22:31:21 . . . 

this just adds more to the rabbit hole but okay.

creations-chat 2021-02-01 17:05:16 sports car in this style anyone? (shattered/glitched/whatever??? because i just came up with a possible system for it)
creations-chat 2021-02-02 02:21:26 tbh it looks pretty low effort. creations has high standards and this looks like it was made in 10-15 minutes. also you can get warned or even creations blacklist if you keep posting these types of build so yeah...
creations-chat 2021-02-02 03:32:14 using that defense doesn't make it any better. people judge on looks and functionality. yours is just a giant mess of cutters. sure it functions well (probably) but does it look good? totally... doesn't

help 2021-02-11 00:12:47 prob angled motorlocking
help 2021-02-11 01:27:32 thanks  for the ping. so its basically motorlocking but before you motor lock you put blocks like explosives or disconnectors. then you put motors to adjust the angle of said part and then explode/disconnect the explosive block/disconnector
help 2021-02-11 01:28:18 i dont rlly mind im not doing anything important rn
help 2021-02-11 01:28:22 im bored :/
help 2021-02-11 01:30:38 im guessing that you put the peg thing on the motor and then leave the flat side out since the peg thing on the motor and disconnector can phase through each other and other blocks  (i have never done it before)

creations-chat 2021-05-27 06:13:41 was it that one sn10?
creations-chat 2021-05-30 06:42:22 (insert request for feedback here)
creations-chat 2021-05-30 07:00:51 nope, might make that in the future sometime, its harder than i though to add the functionality of a mech along with a vehicle mode. ima also head to bed, its late.
creations-chat 2021-06-01 20:40:12 shit's getting heated again 🔥
creations-chat 2021-06-01 20:43:02 people using lgbtq as an insult during pride month, nice
creations-chat 2021-06-06 01:09:43 <:nooo:787097964946259978>
creations-chat 2021-06-21 05:16:03 the space here seems too long, other than that, solid jet
creations-chat 2021-06-21 20:29:56 turbine front has some gaps, try smoothening and/or covering those, wings also seem a bit too thick, other than that, pretty darn solid
creations-chat 2021-06-21 20:34:20 you can see the jet engine through the thing you put on it to seemingly cover the front of the jet engine, try using wedges inside the cover to cover the visible white
creations-chat 2021-06-22 02:21:49 try adding a hammer, hand guard/heatshield, sling points (literally loops) a second door for the loading port, and try using half blocks for the scope, pretty solid model
creations-chat 2021-06-22 02:26:03 i see, also <@!805968531228590121>  they could try elevating the receiver or making the wood stock smaller for that
creations-chat 2021-06-22 02:32:19 make the grip a bit more round
creations-chat 2021-06-22 06:31:39 <@!193852687584985088>  only feedback i have is that the hammer is too small and there are no sights on the barrel, other than that, solid.
creations-chat 2021-06-22 06:35:48 that fool! detail is **always** necessary!
creations-chat 2021-06-22 17:24:48 motorrrrrrrr

creations-chat 2021-06-29 16:33:23 would this count as offensive german t

creations-chat 2021-06-30 08:49:41 https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/804439412497973278.gif?v=1
creations-chat 2021-06-30 18:55:36 <@456226577798135808>  remove the rocket spam and put only a few. the back fins look out of place and the fins in the front could benefit from some simple motorlocking
creations-chat 2021-06-30 18:58:17 I'm not even being toxic, I'm giving genuine feedback.
creations-chat 2021-06-30 19:21:32 i agree with everything you just said
creations-chat 2021-06-30 19:35:35 ikr
creations-chat 2021-07-01 20:15:20 <@456226577798135808>  for your friend's godzilla i would recommend that he make the arms less blocky use half cylinders or half balls to add some texture to the arms instead of just being blocks, as for your godzilla i would probably say to start from scratch.
creations-chat 2021-07-05 05:55:15 come one man you can do better
creations-chat 2021-07-06 07:26:05 i did
creations-chat 2021-07-13 21:42:25 the torso is where the problem is. try making it sleeker and smaller
creations-chat 2021-07-13 22:20:19 any feedback on the main body so far? i'm making another arkham knight batmobile to add more detail and function because the last one didnt have a working cockpit and retractable turret
creations-chat 2021-07-13 22:22:39 this but i havent made the limbs and wheels yet
creations-chat 2021-07-13 23:07:24 indeed but it will prob look better once i add the limbs and wheels

creations-chat 2021-07-15 08:47:42 if i was really stretching for complaints then maybe those top back fins. still, solid jet
creations-chat 2021-07-15 08:52:57 phantom1716th is claiming to be a the best pcc user ever and this chat is tearing him to shreds

creations-chat 2021-08-01 06:30:44 looking for feedback and recommendations on another batmobile, (wow what a big surprise) this time its from arkham asylum, so far it has working wheels and an opening cockpit
creations-chat 2021-08-04 03:08:44 he would have been proud
creations-chat 2021-08-04 04:47:42 ikr the propeller blades
creations-chat 2021-08-04 04:51:47 perhaps this? i don't rlly care about exposed motors but some people do
creations-chat 2021-08-05 18:48:53 some just look better in others, the plane you posted looks stubby, the ship looks blocky and same with the eiffel tower you posted
creations-chat 2021-08-09 05:23:39 should i continue (insert joke about lighting our darkest hour here)
creations-chat 2021-08-09 06:47:21 prob not but i will try

creations-chat 2021-08-21 01:18:04 <@!447139512707973120>  i know i don't have any ranks and you might as well use that against me but this one hurts, the dust cover looks really gappy, unnecessary motorlock, horrible looking grip, ugly magazine, and the stock looks like you straight up just gave up on it mid way. the only good part here is the barrel and handguard. not even counting the irons on it.  https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/384025409945337856/878441910618972213
creations-chat 2021-08-21 05:30:12 yo anyone want me to make this with actual functions that are in batman forever (yes its another batmobile i swear that this isnt an addiction)
creations-chat 2021-08-24 14:39:04 prob a ruger lul
creations-chat 2021-08-27 05:55:39 
creations-chat 2021-08-28 03:51:38 Just because you have a higher rank doesn’t cover up the fact that you missed the opportunity to add more detail.
creations-chat 2021-08-28 03:59:51 Yikes blockate really isn’t taking this well
creations-chat 2021-08-28 04:23:23 blockate, this truck looks bad. admit it. the wheels look a bit too small, the rims are horrible, the body itself is plain as hell, the roof is too thick, the doors are glued together and the bed itself could have been done better with half blocks or disconnectors. and i am guessing that there is no interior either or at least one not visible. in simple words, a shit ton of missed potential. your rank doesn't save you this time.
creations-chat 2021-08-28 04:32:13 worse, the doors are once again gorilla glued to the body, the car itself is flat as fuck, wheels and rims are bullshit and looking like they are indented into the body, the grill is poorly executed, no visible interior besides that black bar inside and the bed's outer shape is still too chunky on top of the body still looking bad. 
TLDR: if you are gonna say something is better, then make it better, your rank doesn't save you from criticism.
creations-chat 2021-08-28 04:36:39 in my opinion those were decent, (not including thomas) those 2 trucks still have no excuse.
creations-chat 2021-08-28 04:46:24 especially when they flex a rank in something (in this case land vehicles) they obviously can't do that well or don't have much knowledge of whilst using their non related rank to defend themselves
creations-chat 2021-08-28 16:06:14 guess i can't make existing vehicles now
creations-chat 2021-08-28 18:43:39 Get lvl 3 by chatting or something
creations-chat 2021-08-29 00:14:30 gives me hot rod vibes lol
creations-chat 2021-08-29 07:58:46 What
creations-chat 2021-08-31 06:48:36 Still better than any vehicles you make (that we have seen)
creations-chat 2021-09-01 06:44:06 ._.
creations-chat 2021-09-03 06:03:16 gotta realize ranks don't justify everything
creations-chat 2021-09-03 06:06:12 too lazy to get the ones i can get -_-
creations-chat 2021-09-10 00:26:53 Maybe make it a bit bulkier??? Also the face looks a bit plain but yet again it is pretty small
creations-chat 2021-09-11 01:33:34 Would it hurt to at least add some more detail? Maybe some surrounding buildings or some windows? also panzer, 9/11 is the time terrorists crashed planes into the national trade towers
creations-chat 2021-09-11 01:37:39 I think another one next to the towers fell and the buildings at the bottom caught fire? (I don’t know every single detail srry)
creations-chat 2021-09-11 01:40:43 God dammit smoke
creations-chat 2021-09-11 01:44:42 <@!693782995664109679>  made a shitty twin tower memorial
creations-chat 2021-09-11 02:00:37 Either someone gets called a dumbass, is a dumbass, or acts like a dumbass, makes sense
creations-chat 2021-09-11 02:18:52 the small ish argument that went over big smoke's 9/11 build that looks... bad to say the least
creations-chat 2021-09-11 17:51:57 Same shit happened yesterday, next please.
creations-chat 2021-09-12 08:25:31 cheese
creations-chat 2021-09-13 07:49:06 Build a plane for treasure
creations-chat 2021-09-17 06:15:41 anyone know who star saber (or in this case saber) is
creations-chat 2021-09-17 19:15:13 Try using a smoke pipe on the tip for the hole in the barrel
creations-chat 2021-09-17 19:29:44 what look are you trying to go for?
creations-chat 2021-09-17 19:40:00 how does this star saber look so far? i'm trying to get feedback mainly on the left thruster part so i can have little trouble making the other
creations-chat 2021-09-17 19:42:15 sure why not
creations-chat 2021-09-17 21:53:09 Yes and tbh it’s a flying brick and I tried making the colors closer to the show but any recommendations? Is it too bright?
creations-chat 2021-09-17 21:55:28 Ah, got it, I’ll do that now
creations-chat 2021-09-17 22:18:31 Yeah I got it, I’m changing the colors and adding some more detail
creations-chat 2021-09-19 01:56:00 creation? this is bad comedy ._.
creations-chat 2021-09-19 08:27:28 Indeed it is
creations-chat 2021-09-19 08:29:38 Judging by the rest of it, most likely
creations-chat 2021-09-19 19:32:08 purple
creations-chat 2021-09-22 06:12:13 So anyone want any headmasters? (This is just an example)
creations-chat 2021-09-22 06:44:17 Maybe it’s just for the sake of posting it or the “oh well, I know this might be trash but here it is just in case it gets me a good rank”
creations-chat 2021-09-22 06:47:15 More of a debate but sure
creations-chat 2021-09-22 07:00:28 Alt f4
creations-chat 2021-09-22 07:03:02 instant hof
creations-chat 2021-09-22 07:05:41 Did that mini heli guy just repost the exact same thing
creations-chat 2021-09-22 07:08:04 Ah ok I see
creations-chat 2021-09-22 07:12:26 Check his ranks-
creations-chat 2021-09-22 07:15:26 r/therewasanattempt
creations-chat 2021-09-22 07:18:37 But you certainly implied that the first time ._.
creations-chat 2021-09-22 14:45:05 <:largerabbit:772883550349426719>
creations-chat 2021-09-23 06:27:29 I got a bad feeling about this
creations-chat 2021-09-25 19:57:29 any feedback on my batman ninja batmobile? (i didn't have many reference picks without the dust effects so srry if i miss anything)
creations-chat 2021-09-26 04:36:17 Maybe the angle on the front? But I’m really stretching for complaints with that because it looks good
creations-chat 2021-09-26 05:42:54 Try making the door ice?
creations-chat 2021-09-26 06:13:43 Maybe the tr3b black manta with a working “anti gravity” function?
creations-chat 2021-09-27 07:13:10 The colors too

creations-chat 2021-10-01 01:48:14 bad comedy <:KEKW:670310537300672528>
creations-chat 2021-10-01 02:38:03 detail?
creations-chat 2021-10-01 02:46:41 i guess it really depends on the sub tbh, just looks pretty bare without some symbol or wedges on it. just looks like a tube with fins, rudder, and a block on top of it
creations-chat 2021-10-01 02:50:38 admittedly, yes but even the body could use some rounding out and maybe some more wedges on it so that the part on top doesn't look like it was a last second thought
creations-chat 2021-10-10 05:51:11 **warthog tiem?**
creations-chat 2021-10-10 06:01:55 anyone remember that v shaped thing that floated over arizona and just nyoooomed away at blinding speeds?
creations-chat 2021-10-10 06:05:09 the hard part is making the thing fly at those speeds in the first place ;-;
creations-chat 2021-10-10 06:15:16 I might actually be able to make that work but v is superior shape
creations-chat 2021-10-10 08:11:07 Copy and paste <:trollface:775024642104229898>
creations-chat 2021-10-10 08:46:04 Damn he’s good, no way I would have guessed that even with the brain of Einstein
creations-chat 2021-10-10 16:54:13 alright let’s get started. The body is very blank, the cockpit seems like it stopped being even remotely round, the body of the plane looks like it was half crushed, and the fact that you reposted the images TWICE is just unbearable
creations-chat 2021-10-10 16:58:33 What did you expect? One of them to be drowned in upvotes?
creations-chat 2021-10-10 17:00:54 How did it happen 3 times tho ._.

creations-chat 2021-10-11 07:47:50 i'm trying to make the saucer from destroy all humans, any feedback on what is pretty much the front section? (the motorlock is intentional detail)

creations-chat 2021-10-17 08:53:25 I could do surgery with that
creations-chat 2021-10-17 16:38:27 Which batmobile
creations-chat 2021-10-17 16:45:12 In that case there is pretty much nothing signifying that Batman would drive that, no fancy bat wings, no bat symbols, no fancy technology he has on nearly every car he has every made, yadda yadda yadda you get it
creations-chat 2021-10-17 16:51:16 So a red car
creations-chat 2021-10-17 16:59:26 The only thing I can think of is when Lego needs a few extra bucks and slaps the batmobile/batwing/whatever label on it like this
