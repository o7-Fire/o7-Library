help 2022-08-17 23:50:15 I have a problem with motors
I'm just gonna try to visualize. Say I have a turret with 2 motor 2's on it. One for up and down. If I were to put a motor on the gun part of the turret the motor 2's SPIRAL out of control. Is there anyway to fix it?

help 2022-08-22 05:38:56 I need some help with some physics or something. I have a kinda big plane and it might be the issue. But whenever I turn left or right and use the up button at any point of time after pressing it, it spirals in the direction I turned. (the plane picture for perspective)
help 2022-08-22 05:39:09 The plane can top 1400 as well but I don't think speed is the problem

help 2022-08-30 14:41:59 Is angle locking broken? (say if you use motor locks to make custom wedges with blocks. The blocks no longer clip into eachother to make custom wedges)
help 2022-08-30 14:43:06 I looked up a video on how to do it but it didn't work. Is there some other updated way?
help 2022-09-06 17:42:24 Really? Because the video I saw was months ago and I really don't think PC is updated

help 2022-09-13 21:13:33 Shit is fire
help 2022-09-13 21:16:33 Yeah want a tut on how to do it?

help 2022-09-13 21:28:21 You could make motor locked hover engines
