plane-crazy 2020-05-06 05:02:38 ~~also my brother made a terrorist van for pvp~~
plane-crazy 2020-05-06 05:02:29 Whatever, I could probably make another plane.
plane-crazy 2020-05-06 05:02:06 I haven't changed it since I managed to get it working, which was early-ish last year
plane-crazy 2020-05-06 05:01:24 That was basically the idea of the plane. It's almost entirely wings and rockets.
plane-crazy 2020-05-06 05:00:52 ~~i don't know how to feel about that~~
plane-crazy 2020-05-06 04:59:49 It doesn't fold.
plane-crazy 2020-05-06 04:59:46 Nope.
plane-crazy 2020-05-06 04:56:42 It's like the entire game's been rescripted. The only plane that *does* work has several issues. Turning is much less responsive, and if I move my mouse even *slightly* down, it nosedives.
plane-crazy 2020-05-06 04:50:20 None of my planes work anymore ._.
plane-crazy 2019-09-07 02:54:45 Like, what? Only one server I'm in does that.
plane-crazy 2019-09-07 02:54:23 It's not like any other servers are enforcing the <13 rule... I think.
plane-crazy 2019-09-07 02:54:02 Nah looks like 13+ to me
plane-crazy 2019-09-07 02:35:46 I just made a water bike.
