The Tale of prichinyaiulyudyambol (598107577833750548)
bug-reports 2020-10-08 12:47:47 Hello dear administration of the game. I would like to inform you about such a problem that in pvp mode in MOTION, that is, without standing, I shoot from a rocket and this rocket disappears. I cannot shoot rockets while flying in an airplane or in motion of a tank. The machine guns work, but it doesn't comfort me. This has been going on for a long time and I am worried that I will never be able to become a full-fledged participant in pvp battles. My nickname in the game: xBeJlukux
I tried to play from another account and even from another computer, but nothing helps. At the same time, I tried to play from a friend's account, who, before letting me play, checked: his missiles fly and cause damage. With me, they just disappear. Please help me please
