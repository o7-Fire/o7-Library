creations-chat 2022-05-08 01:49:21 How's my Viggen for a first build?
creations-chat 2022-05-08 01:55:43 What can I do better <:Hmm:937421617749983252>
creations-chat 2022-05-08 02:06:06 This isn’t the first thing I’ve ever built in any game ever. I’ve played other building games, looked at many tutorials, and got help from other users. This is the first thing I’ve ever built in plane crazy. I have done test flights in small test planes that are just some blocks, a jet engine, and some control surfaces, but i don’t think that counts as a build.
creations-chat 2022-05-08 02:08:33 Well, its pretty simple, I wasn’t using any motor locks or anythng. Most complex thing I used was the custom control surfaces. I’m not 5 btw
creations-chat 2022-05-08 02:10:22 Also, I spent many hours on this and have been working on it since last night.
creations-chat 2022-05-08 03:48:40 So basically, people don't like builds that don't take 9 days to build
creations-chat 2022-05-08 03:50:52 well, what did you think about my build anyway
creations-chat 2022-05-08 03:52:42 QUICK DOWNVOTE HIM BEFORE HE REALIZES IT DOESN'T MATTER!
