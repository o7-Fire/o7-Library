bot-central 2021-04-01 15:19:07 How
creations-chat 2021-06-09 06:09:07 ok
creations-chat 2021-06-09 06:14:27 ;-; I was telling the dude what the symbol was. I'm honestly surprised that's considered a bad word. also, lol
creations-chat 2021-06-09 06:16:37 bruh how did so many ppl see it I deleted it like 2 seconds after I posted it XD
creations-chat 2021-06-09 06:18:38 can we continue these conversations in another channel that doesn't have a 2 min cooldown XD
bug-reports 2021-06-09 06:23:58 this has been happening to me for a really long time, I just forgot to report it. basically, the game thinks there is a block where there actually isn't. it usually occurs when I delete a block and the game deletes the block, but thinks there is still a block there. the only way to fix this is to save the file, and then reload it.
creations-chat 2021-06-10 03:49:17 same with my engine :/
help 2021-06-11 20:49:11 yo can someone help me? I need a (preferably flexible) compact way to tighten these treads.
help 2021-06-11 20:50:16 I tried ropes and suspension, but they really aren't great solutions. The ropes move too much, and the suspension is a little too buggy
help 2021-06-11 20:50:42 I would use motor locks, but they compress much less
help 2021-06-11 20:51:21 (rope goes to 20% of it's original size and motor lock goes to 50%)
help 2021-06-11 20:51:51 here's a picture of the treads spawned in.
help 2021-06-12 01:10:06 it can't be more than 1 block tall, and has to compress the ENTIRE thing into about a 1-3 block long section while being a max of 4 blocks wide. Doesn't matter tho. after experimenting for about an hour, I finally found a way to use motor locks by chunking it out into multiple parts rather than 1 big part.
bug-reports 2021-06-12 01:33:43 soooooo I just noticed something. I'm making some tank treads, but they consist mostly of disconnectors and motors (1 motor 3 disconnectors for every 1 block of length). Since my current tread uses just over 500 disconnectors (I'll prob get it down to 400-480, I've noticed that the disconnectors sometimes don't respond when in large quantities. What I mean is, I have the same keybind for all disconnectors, yet sometimes only some go off, and I have to press the button twice. I've noticed it's usually the most recently placed disconnectors that do this.

bug-reports 2021-06-12 02:40:29 nah
bug-reports 2021-06-12 02:40:32 they still work
bug-reports 2021-06-12 02:40:37 it's just the startup sequence
bug-reports 2021-06-12 02:41:03 also I designed these treads because literally no other treads could handle the kind of stress I'm putting these through XD
bug-reports 2021-06-12 03:02:35 lol
bug-reports 2021-06-12 03:03:00 it would be worse if the button deployed a weapon and you died because it took too long to deploy
bug-reports 2021-06-12 03:09:28 ummmmmm
bug-reports 2021-06-12 03:09:31 my game just broke ;-;
bug-reports 2021-06-12 03:10:31 
bug-reports 2021-06-12 03:10:31 first the game said loading... then, when I opened and closed the menu, there was 3 of everything

creations-chat 2021-06-12 03:11:37 if you want good colors, use a color picker from image, hover over the color u want and input that into plane crazy.
help 2021-06-12 03:12:02 in my opinion I would use treads.
help 2021-06-12 03:12:40 they look the best, have great hill climbing ability, and good handling
help 2021-06-12 03:13:36 I just created a new tread pattern that looks more realistic and performs better too, if you want that.
help 2021-06-12 03:13:47 otherwise, conveyors
help 2021-06-12 03:14:02 only downside to conveyors is they don't have great handling
bug-reports 2021-06-12 03:44:10 this is a bug within roblox. Basically you go so fast, that it breaks the physics engine. Next time try not to go 55.5 billion blocks per second XD
bot-central 2021-06-12 03:44:57 ?shelp
bot-central 2021-06-12 03:45:12 ?rhelp

help 2021-06-12 21:26:54 it'll be long tho
help 2021-06-12 21:27:04 so u gotta find a place to store the blocks
help 2021-06-12 21:27:07 unless
help 2021-06-12 21:27:21 you attached a rope to a suspension with a motor on top
help 2021-06-12 21:27:44 set the suspension to 0 damping and stiffness and 10 free length
help 2021-06-12 21:28:00 then the suspension will prevent the ropes from moving too much
help 2021-06-12 21:28:14 or
help 2021-06-12 21:28:18 you could just use ropes :/
help 2021-06-12 21:28:37 if u want I could try to design a chain tho
help 2021-06-12 21:28:48 aight
