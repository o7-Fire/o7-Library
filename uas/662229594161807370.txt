creations-chat 2020-06-25 03:37:19 God speed
creations-chat 2020-06-25 03:37:24 No hack but seems to be bug
creations-chat 2020-06-25 03:37:44 i did that by putting motor on anchor balock, and flip it
creations-chat 2020-06-25 03:37:59 suddenly god speed reached
creations-chat 2020-06-29 23:22:52 Why do ppl hate this
creations-chat 2020-06-29 23:23:07 It has working suspension and door
creations-chat 2022-12-30 05:55:38 Tell me what I need to improve
creations-chat 2022-12-30 06:39:05 Thx (finally someone that knows rc)
creations-chat 2022-12-30 06:41:15 I would try , first thing to do is to add 4 support columns then making of a downforce shell( pan car shell)/ use your idea( better)
creations-chat 2022-12-30 06:46:11 Shaft driven rc ( in progress so far only rear is done)
It has camber tuning
creations-chat 2022-12-30 06:52:33 Jeff Gordonâ€™s ?
creations-chat 2022-12-30 06:55:15 Alright Gordonâ€™s it is
creations-chat 2022-12-30 15:09:15 The angle:
creations-chat 2022-12-30 15:13:10 Front camber and rear camber maximum:
(As told I can tune them independently)
creations-chat 2022-12-30 15:18:52 ^little note over camber can cause decreased handling and the overdoing the front will lift the tyres up that they canâ€™t touch ground anymore
creations-chat 2022-12-30 15:34:46 Whatâ€™s with the ðŸ¤“ you canâ€™t make a car with those function?
creations-chat 2022-12-30 15:36:53 Sure
creations-chat 2022-12-30 15:49:30 Ikr it was pure accident
creations-chat 2022-12-30 16:00:38 Yes but I can make it awd( originally 4wd but I accidentally made drift angle and the front powered wheels disturb drift)
creations-chat 2022-12-31 02:11:01 More ridiculous angle
