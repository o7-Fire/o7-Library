creations-chat 2020-11-09 00:20:15 sadly, no
1. I could try making a bipod later on
2. couldn't figure out how to make a scope, but I could always try tonight
creations-chat 2020-11-09 00:22:17 I haven't figured out how to make it shoot either, plus the barrel can't exactly have anything moving down it, as it's a single filled in cylinder 
on top of that, there isn't much space to work with in the muzzle brake
creations-chat 2020-11-09 00:24:17 anyways, i'm going to work an an AA12 now :')
creations-chat 2020-11-09 00:25:51 orrr I could work on a different gun, if you have any suggestions?

bet

creations-chat 2021-11-13 04:30:35 the blue is a little pale, but otherwise nice
creations-chat 2021-12-09 04:24:57 i would, but I decided to install a motor under it so it would be able to spin if I was stuck in a difficult spot
I might make an alternative version with tape, though
