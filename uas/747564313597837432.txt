creations-chat 2022-02-27 00:22:58 I didn't hold down the key bind long enough for the nose and cockpit so it kinda ruined it. I was too lazy to post another picture 👽
creations-chat 2022-02-27 00:25:09 I wasn't pissed I was just surprised, if anything I was laughing 👽

creations-chat 2022-02-27 20:18:56 i mean its nice just kinda bland
creations-chat 2022-02-27 20:21:28 why you gotta be so rough on him man like jeez 💀 hes probably new and what you're saying isn't gonna help
creations-chat 2022-02-27 20:23:46 im pretty sure none of this is feedback 💀 like why you guys getting so pressed over someone who made a singular train??
creations-chat 2022-02-27 20:26:17 im just trying to help this guy cause yall are going so hard on him <:nooo:787097964946259978>

creations-chat 2022-02-27 20:33:52 damn you're telling me that this community has been more toxic than it already is?!?!
creations-chat 2022-02-27 20:35:54 damn i must be lucky that i never used this server during 2021
creations-chat 2022-02-27 20:37:57 yeah i have to agree with this dude, the train by itself is kinda bland

creations-chat 2022-02-27 20:41:33 nuclear war, just a week away!
creations-chat 2022-02-27 20:43:41 you shouldn't have posted that.... get out of here while you still can
creations-chat 2022-02-27 20:52:49 i got a feeling people are gonna shit on this thing super hard
creations-chat 2022-02-27 20:55:44 yes i use better discord, yes its against the TOS, but the mods probably dont care because they haven't done anything about it <:trollface:775024642104229898>
creations-chat 2022-02-27 20:57:50 i didnt say it was bad i just know how toxic this community is 👽  honestly i thought it was pretty good
creations-chat 2022-02-27 20:59:52 but its cozy here 👽 also e.
creations-chat 2022-02-27 21:01:54 if you say so, even though i just use it for some small addons and cool themes (by mods i meant discord mods, not the server mods)
creations-chat 2022-02-27 21:05:58 i just thought the theme was nice, and who does like toxicity
creations-chat 2022-02-27 21:08:01 i just kinda find it unecessary
creations-chat 2022-02-27 21:10:04 well i guess thats true, but it can still effect people who arent annoying (not me cause even i sometimes find myself annoying)
creations-chat 2022-02-27 21:12:11 i can take ctiticism believe it or not <:OmegaTroll:626841385118597152> , just not when its people calling my builds shit because that really doesn't help with anything. but i guess i can try and be toxic if that helps, i just dont enjoy it.
creations-chat 2022-02-27 21:14:17 political statement?
creations-chat 2022-02-27 21:16:19 well i just prefer critisism that actually tells me whats wrong, "its shit" could mean a lot of things and is overall confusing!!!
creations-chat 2022-02-27 21:18:27 ok! 👍
creations-chat 2022-02-27 21:20:30 that does make sense, its just confusing for me when someone says "its shit" (this damn 2 minute cooldown)
creations-chat 2022-02-27 21:22:35 i think the argument can end here, guess i gotta learn to be toxic (at least i know what its shit means now in pcc language) this was truly interesting <:trollface:775024642104229898>
creations-chat 2022-02-27 21:24:38 ok! 👍
creations-chat 2022-02-27 21:43:16 long story really <:trollface:775024642104229898>
