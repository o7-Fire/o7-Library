the-dump 2020-12-08 13:58:01 Thomas isnt what he used to be, he is a completely different man or *entity*
the-dump 2020-12-08 13:59:40 Man cartoons are falling out this year, first butch Hartman desperate for views and now thomas
the-dump 2020-12-08 14:00:25 We are having a conversation about the fall of Thomas the tank engine
the-dump 2020-12-08 14:01:15 Alright continue, who is leading Thomas the tank engine now
the-dump 2020-12-08 14:01:26 Because thats gotta be a different guy
the-dump 2020-12-08 14:03:50 He is a bit cartoony even for a kid above 9
the-dump 2020-12-08 14:04:22 Like is thomas and friend now aimed for childs below 7?
the-dump 2020-12-08 14:07:18 Alright when was the first episode of thomas the tank engine existed
the-dump 2020-12-08 14:08:03 The original creator already died right?

the-dump 2020-12-08 14:12:10 Whoever has the current rights to Thomas the tank engine show probably has no interest in trains and locomotives
the-dump 2020-12-08 14:13:39 This is why you need to actually hand your show rights to the person you trust
the-dump 2020-12-08 14:14:27 Probably look at them in disgust
