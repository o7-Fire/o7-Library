The Tale of Lensilver (336990223991046144)
help 2020-05-20 14:50:25 What is an outline?
help 2020-05-20 19:01:08 I've building a passenger train that has a very high center of mass, hence making it easily to tip over on a curve. The locomotive is stable because of several jet engines found on the engine compartment of the irl counterpart. However the passenger cars doens't have such engines because of lack of space that i can hide them. How to i make it more stable with that in mind?
help 2020-05-20 19:01:38 It is also worth mention it is not a steam engine, hence not slow. And i don't wanna run it at 20 MPH

help 2020-05-20 21:06:50 in the Land vehicle must be capable of forward motion and turning at the <#609442446249820211> for the Terrain Specialist, is trains capable of turning? Or it needs actual steering power like a car?
help 2020-05-20 22:52:07 Why on this creation where there is a vehicle being hold by an anchored tower, whenever it gets released from it the games slows down? it is not lag, the creation itself gets slower.
help 2020-05-20 22:53:16 You mean, moving parts?
help 2020-05-20 22:58:12 You mean, bad distributed thrusters? The locomotive got thrusters only from the center to the back, but that not cause any slowness at all
help 2020-05-20 22:58:37 Also the coach's bogies are a solid prop made out of ice
help 2020-05-20 22:59:01 The only articulation there is what makes it turn left and right at curves
help 2020-05-20 22:59:37 And the coach's thrusters are also equally distributed
help 2020-05-21 00:26:39 lmao
help 2020-05-21 00:26:45 anyway thanks for the help
help 2020-05-21 14:39:33 Why i can't place certain blocks in certain places?
help 2020-05-21 14:40:01 This half beam automatically gets pushed away every time i try to fill that hole on the roof
help 2020-05-21 15:19:27 Well, i can't move my build in most cases, since i build giant contraptions, it makes impossible to move them
help 2020-05-21 15:40:14 As i said, big contraptions where it reaches the limits of the building area makes it hard to move it
help 2020-05-21 15:40:21 Also, why i shouldn't reload?
help 2020-05-21 15:52:52 Thats what i did
help 2020-05-21 21:03:09 How do i send a suggestion?

help 2020-05-21 21:07:22 Also, when getting the terrain specialist rank, it claims that every single part should be attached to the creation
help 2020-05-21 21:07:38 However, i've got kind of a technique for building trains
help 2020-05-21 21:08:08 On the side of the locomotive, there is a anchored tower that goes right through the top of the building area
help 2020-05-21 21:08:15 And the cars are attached to this tower
help 2020-05-21 21:08:33 When i run the train, the cars fall from the tower, land on the tracks and the tower then come obsolete
help 2020-05-21 21:08:51 Is that against the "Every single part should be attached..." rule?
creations-chat 2020-05-21 23:08:35 Amtrak train i've created in about 2 days, a little bit off-scale but thats related to the building limits

help 2020-05-23 19:04:51 How do i destroy something on a non PVP server?
help 2020-05-23 19:05:10 I mean, i need to get rid of something
help 2020-05-23 19:05:24 But i cannot do that while in build mode
help 2020-05-23 19:45:53 This is a technique that i've created for building both big and long trains. The cars are being hold by an anchored block, and they fall after the are below them be completely clear. But when the top coach falls into the track, the game slows down because of the size of the cars. There is any way to increase the game speed with this?
help 2020-05-27 21:48:01 Between the drive wheels "Bix wheels", should i give a space between them or no?
help 2020-05-27 21:54:43 <@!335176451038904331> You just need conventional wheels
help 2020-05-27 21:55:15 Like this
help 2020-05-27 21:55:22 A wheel for run into the tracks
help 2020-05-27 21:55:27 and another hold the train
help 2020-05-27 22:00:09 If you're building a diesel locomotive, it should be articulated like this
help 2020-05-27 22:00:36 In this case, each axle has its own second wheel who keeps the train on the tracks
help 2020-05-27 22:01:08 And each pair of axle is connected to a truck, which is connected through an axle to the body of the locomotive

help 2020-06-08 09:15:08 Why my unpowered motors aren't spinning?
help 2020-06-08 09:15:23 They're acting like they are powered/locked ones
help 2020-06-08 09:15:31 but still not having any of these on
bug-reports 2020-06-08 09:17:38 Motor's are broken. The articulation doens't have physics, and when connected with something, acts like an actual block
bug-reports 2020-06-09 03:52:52 Train wheel's disc that hold it on the tracks are way too close to the tracks, which can result in derailents by two ways: One by creating a 6 axle train truck, where the middle axle derails by being  forced against the track on a curve. The second way is by the wheels jumping from the tracks while entering a curve, as the discs climb the rails
help 2020-06-09 06:19:18 Anybody had already made a image of the map of Plane Crazy?
bug-reports 2020-06-09 07:01:05 train wheels doens't save colors

creations-chat 2020-10-03 22:52:19 but still nice, nice job on it
creations-chat 2020-10-03 22:53:06 tbh i only care abut truck size due to the trailer, i build mine quite small so i can acomodate the double trailer
