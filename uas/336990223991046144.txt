plane-crazy 2020-06-22 12:50:29 Why the lava and water splitter ain't working?
plane-crazy 2020-06-09 13:17:53 is the slow motion feature that slow down potentially laggy creations an official Roblox feature or it is a Plane Crazy function?
plane-crazy 2020-06-09 06:54:09 Red means double track, pink means single track, grey means tunnel, light blue means cargo station, yellow means passenger station
plane-crazy 2020-06-09 06:53:33 Something
plane-crazy 2020-06-08 09:52:43 i think that is a bug
plane-crazy 2020-06-08 09:52:37 <@!540991000752160809> You mean the side where the wheel connects on its axle?
plane-crazy 2020-06-08 09:36:26 but have way too much moving parts
plane-crazy 2020-06-08 09:36:19 However, Radials are still possible
plane-crazy 2020-06-08 09:36:11 Which can be fixed by making the disc away from the tracks
plane-crazy 2020-06-08 09:35:58 Because the middle wheel would derail the train
plane-crazy 2020-06-08 09:35:51 You can't build "conventional" trucks
plane-crazy 2020-06-08 09:35:39 By the way, one thing i've notice while testing the train wheels was this
plane-crazy 2020-06-08 09:34:38 what is that? Rank for building trains?
plane-crazy 2020-06-08 09:34:28 conductor rank?
plane-crazy 2020-06-08 09:33:22 That is used on steam locomotives
plane-crazy 2020-06-08 09:33:09 train wheels that don't have the disc for holding it on the track
plane-crazy 2020-06-08 09:32:55 I think we really need blind train wheels
plane-crazy 2020-06-08 09:32:09 The disc behind the wheel should be actually more distant from the track
plane-crazy 2020-06-08 09:32:09 Yeah
plane-crazy 2020-06-08 09:29:46 Altought they need some rework
plane-crazy 2020-06-08 09:29:32 But speaking of the train wheels, they actually need to be strange like that
plane-crazy 2020-06-08 09:28:39 I mean, i think we need bigger curves for tracks
plane-crazy 2020-06-08 09:12:56 weird in which way?
plane-crazy 2020-05-21 19:36:49 Just some tip
plane-crazy 2020-05-21 19:35:21 Nothing too special, but attaching your train couplers into the trucks can make them very more smoother at curves
plane-crazy 2020-05-21 15:24:22 Is this a good creation?
