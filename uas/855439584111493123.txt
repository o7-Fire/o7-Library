creations-chat 2022-10-10 20:27:35 Heres a plane I made
creations-chat 2022-10-10 20:31:42 heres the plane in top view
creations-chat 2022-10-11 15:00:55 Imagine it gets upvoted
creations-chat 2022-10-12 01:27:39 I made these out of boredom, any thoughts?
creations-chat 2022-10-12 01:29:55 Tbh, they aren't really made to look pretty
creations-chat 2022-10-12 01:32:23 by the way, the one wing still flies, there is also a motor attaching the wing to the main hull to make it go up and down without turning to the left
creations-chat 2022-10-12 01:34:33 Fuuuu-
creations-chat 2022-10-12 15:27:43 What if I make another abnormal plane
creations-chat 2022-10-12 15:29:50 I already have an idea of what it should be <:FineTroll:626841259746656289>
creations-chat 2022-10-12 15:33:51 I'm gonna make a plane that can launch like a rocket yet still fly like a plane
creations-chat 2022-10-12 15:35:58 Yes, but it's gonna launch vertically and land vertically, like those space x boosters
creations-chat 2022-10-12 15:38:30 Yeah, half block and elite know what I'm talking about
creations-chat 2022-10-12 15:41:07 I'm gonna make it look like a rocket, but then 2 wings would fold out, basically an F-14 wing mechanism
creations-chat 2022-10-12 19:57:22 I should try to make that..
creations-chat 2022-10-12 20:12:41 Huh
creations-chat 2022-10-13 20:16:09 Why not use sparklers?
creations-chat 2022-10-13 20:19:03 I mean, it can be used for a barrel
the-dump 2022-10-17 15:13:49 
creations-chat 2022-10-17 19:18:51 How did you attach the sparklers together?

Oh ok
creations-chat 2022-10-17 19:21:00 <:Upvote:490311647492309004>
creations-chat 2022-10-17 19:24:26 Should I make this even though I have no idea how to make the wheels
creations-chat 2022-10-17 19:26:56 Alright time to sound like an idiot.

creations-chat 2022-10-17 19:29:01 Ohhh, so basically make it tiny
creations-chat 2022-10-17 19:31:05 Yes I do know what motor lock is
creations-chat 2022-10-17 19:33:49 Alright, I also know *some* cam lock so it should help I hope
creations-chat 2022-10-17 23:53:48 Think this can be a good idea for a build? I'm also gonna make the engine that pulls this
creations-chat 2022-10-17 23:59:42 Change of plans I'm making this
creations-chat 2022-10-18 01:08:29 any improvements i can make?
creations-chat 2022-10-18 01:10:34 oh i havent thought of using those, thanks
creations-chat 2022-10-18 15:26:25 9 year old shredder users when they see this
creations-chat 2022-10-18 15:47:23 What if I make another version of the logo?

creations-chat 2022-10-19 03:38:35 What improvements do I need to do, I have no idea how to solve the exposed motor lock though
creations-chat 2022-10-20 15:23:19 Thoughts on this?
creations-chat 2022-10-20 15:34:25 Jeez you make a tall tower just for those?
creations-chat 2022-10-20 17:30:01 Hmmm, should I make a smoke artillery gun?
creations-chat 2022-10-20 17:37:27 He already did
creations-chat 2022-10-21 21:33:28 It needs to look like you have actually put the work into it, I think
creations-chat 2022-10-21 21:56:01 Oh ok
creations-chat 2022-10-25 14:40:07 Ooh, I should make a build specificly to make people mad as well
