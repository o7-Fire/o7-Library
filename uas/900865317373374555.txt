creations-chat 2022-11-09 00:24:53 i posted a random picture of a jet i made and i noticed how it gets lot's of dislikes
it's like nothing deserves an upvote unless it looks like it was made by someone who doesn't have a life and has never been outside for 26 days
creations-chat 2022-11-09 00:30:41 yeah i know the rating is good, but i'm still wondering why a lot of people think that builds that aren't the best of the best are just bad
it's just a little confusing, not annoying
creations-chat 2022-11-09 00:33:56 yeah lol

creations-chat 2022-12-24 20:47:24 that makes sense but that won't allow me to do some of the more realistic shapes

creations-chat 2023-01-20 17:16:57 hi again lol
i kind of dropped this idea cause theres almost no space
i'm still occasionally  trying to add it
creations-chat 2023-01-20 17:56:57 made this smooth it looks awesome
creations-chat 2023-01-20 18:04:36 edit: i think the jet is acceptable if you think of it as unique

creations-chat 2023-01-20 21:54:12 your version of good is blender mesh quality. can't you just accept builds from people that don't play plane crazy 14 hours a day?
creations-chat 2023-01-20 22:17:51 thanks i understand
i'm still early with jets and to me, i think where i'm at is impressive for myself

creations-chat 2023-03-07 21:29:28 bro lmao
your boat is also like a box. it barely looks like the actual yacht

1. it's not detailed, looks like 2 hours went into it only
2. the yacht shown on the left is smooth while yours is not. literally take an hour to learn motorlock and stuff.
3. your windows are not accurate. you're saying how accurate your yacht is
4. your superstructure is too tall
5. like i said before, you even told me my yacht looked like a box when yours does too
6. your hull does not have the same color or material
