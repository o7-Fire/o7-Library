plane-crazy 2020-05-30 12:41:51 this sistem
plane-crazy 2020-05-30 12:41:46 
plane-crazy 2020-05-30 12:41:33 so it gets rid of this weird arm you use to connect segments of big builds
plane-crazy 2020-05-30 12:41:09 so the connector has a face similar to magnets and when two connectors touch on those faces they create a weld
plane-crazy 2020-05-30 12:39:38 block
plane-crazy 2020-05-30 12:39:33 meh
plane-crazy 2020-05-30 12:38:37 but they weld to eachother
plane-crazy 2020-05-30 12:38:24 bassicly magnets
plane-crazy 2020-05-30 12:36:55 two connector blocks put face to face will weld together
plane-crazy 2020-05-30 12:35:20 pettion to add a connector block wich is usefull for large builds

plane-crazy 2020-05-17 18:05:50 (wikipedia.org)
plane-crazy 2020-05-17 18:05:42 The BT-42 was a Finnish assault gun, constructed during the Continuation War. It was constructed from captured Soviet BT-7 light tanks and British 4.5-inch howitzers (114 mm-calibre light howitzer, model 1908) from 1918, which had been donated during the Winter War. Only eighteen vehicles were constructed.
