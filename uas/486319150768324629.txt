oOo?
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 17:30:03 The devs need to make a gamemode that allow us to actually feel the challenge part in Plane Crazy..
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 11:01:52 It would be interesting to see Plane Crazy be the first building game to have both "Creative" and "Survival challenge mode"
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 11:01:36 Starter creations would start off with rusted weaker parts..
Like faulty control panels, small rusted propaller engines, weak motors..
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 11:01:23 So you have to buy in points that you earn to upgrade the blocks..
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 11:00:55 The more coins you have = the more you can spend on usful features on your creation
Like upgrading your starter blocks
Or unlocking different / stronger materials
Like i mean.. the game already has a list of weakest to strongest engines
Why not implament it into a single block?
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 11:00:19 The devs need to make a gamemode that allow us to actually feel the challenge part in Plane Crazy.. Like to Great Goals for us to travel across terrained areas for points, Points could be earned by the weight of the object you choose to trasport

plane-crazy 2020-01-20 06:49:58 Thats fine..
plane-crazy 2020-01-20 06:49:24 Sure
plane-crazy 2020-01-20 06:48:34 Basically i need a motor that i can keep un powered then be able to power it again without returning to my base to change it with the purple tool..
plane-crazy 2020-01-20 06:47:09 But while im flying my plane i need the gyro to be able to rotate on its own and while still being able to rotate its motors when i need it to
plane-crazy 2020-01-20 06:46:33 Ik, at the moment im trying to make a gyroscope using an inf stabilizer as its center
plane-crazy 2020-01-20 06:45:53 That would be cool
plane-crazy 2020-01-20 06:44:31 Why don't they add an On/Off mode for the motors in the game?
plane-crazy 2019-11-19 00:19:10 Yeah me and you too xd
plane-crazy 2019-11-19 00:18:44 Life is full of mistakes, and none of them are being fixed.. for even if we try, the rulers of the world wont allow it.
