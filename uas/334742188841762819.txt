creations-chat 2018-11-30 01:05:01 Is there a good way to make small gears?
creations-chat 2018-11-30 01:05:22 I am having trouble getting enough teeth in a small area for my ornithopter I am building
creations-chat 2018-11-30 01:05:33 it is taking up like a 5th of my plot
creations-chat 2018-11-30 01:05:37 and doesn't even work
creations-chat 2018-11-30 01:06:28 
creations-chat 2018-11-30 01:07:07 the gears?
creations-chat 2018-11-30 01:07:19 they are on the back
creations-chat 2018-11-30 01:07:29 I will do another screen shot with them in a different color
creations-chat 2018-11-30 01:08:53 idk
creations-chat 2018-11-30 01:09:10 I am using anchor blocks until I get the flapping system working
creations-chat 2018-11-30 01:09:29 I got a picture with the gears in red
creations-chat 2018-11-30 01:09:38 
creations-chat 2018-11-30 01:10:38 no
creations-chat 2018-11-30 01:10:40 actual gears
creations-chat 2018-11-30 01:11:05 smaller and/or more teeth in the same area
creations-chat 2018-11-30 01:11:18 because as is they don't work right
creations-chat 2018-11-30 01:11:39 even just more teeth is fine in a larger area
creations-chat 2018-11-30 01:11:43 but preferably smaller
creations-chat 2018-11-30 01:12:00 not thinner
creations-chat 2018-11-30 01:12:04 smaller diameter
creations-chat 2018-11-30 01:12:58 I can't use more gears
creations-chat 2018-11-30 01:13:02 I have to use 4
creations-chat 2018-11-30 01:13:07 and they need more teeth
creations-chat 2018-11-30 01:13:15 otherwise they skip and don't function properly
creations-chat 2018-11-30 01:13:36 and then it's off sync
creations-chat 2018-11-30 01:13:39 and it gets stuck
creations-chat 2018-11-30 01:14:00 I can do that
creations-chat 2018-11-30 01:14:01 but
creations-chat 2018-11-30 01:14:06 4 teeth is not enough
creations-chat 2018-11-30 01:14:48 That is what I am going to do
creations-chat 2018-11-30 01:15:13 but I just need to get more teeth in there
creations-chat 2018-11-30 01:15:20 otherwise this won't work
creations-chat 2018-11-30 01:16:14 I know how gears work
creations-chat 2018-11-30 01:16:20 I just need more teeth on the gears
creations-chat 2018-11-30 01:16:29 because they are skipping and not working right
creations-chat 2018-11-30 01:16:35 especially the middle 2 gears
creations-chat 2018-11-30 01:16:50 only 2 are powered
creations-chat 2018-11-30 01:16:54 the center 2
creations-chat 2018-11-30 01:17:01 and they are going opposite eachother
creations-chat 2018-11-30 01:17:03 I can unpower one
creations-chat 2018-11-30 01:17:19 but then that side just kind of limps and doesn't work right
creations-chat 2018-11-30 01:17:31 because there are not enough teeth
creations-chat 2018-11-30 01:17:34 to keep it there
help 2018-12-01 17:34:02 what does the reset function on the motors do?
bug-reports 2018-12-01 23:38:37 I got this speed with the parachute which actually could be used by itself to do this, jumping on it repeatedly sends you flying and if you are lucky you can deactivate and reactivate it for this to happen
bug-reports 2018-12-01 23:39:05 btw, that number is ten quadrillions of sps
bug-reports 2018-12-01 23:45:49 what did you do to the game?
bug-reports 2018-12-01 23:46:09 I have seen it come apart a little on the corner before but not that much
bug-reports 2018-12-02 04:59:14 It's under settings
help 2018-12-02 23:35:06 I can't move my creation up for some reason, it just gives me an error message, I can still build upwards but I need to move the creation upwards, any idea why it would do this? this has happened on other creations as well
help 2018-12-02 23:36:22 there is nothing nearly high enough up to be colliding with the top
help 2018-12-02 23:36:45 I am trying to find a way to check underneath
help 2018-12-02 23:37:59 there appears to be nothing underneath
creations-chat 2018-12-03 02:57:56 Tommy5015 | Boeing 747 | 598 Blocks | Willing to take any rank, preferably replicator
creations-chat 2018-12-03 03:01:11 idk, that was the inspiration for it
creations-chat 2018-12-03 03:01:22 some sort of commercial airliner
creations-chat 2018-12-03 03:04:42 they have some resemblance, I was limited by build space for everything
creations-chat 2018-12-03 03:05:11 Tommy5015 | Ornithopter/Bird/Bat | 197 blocks | Unsure if I could get any roles with this as it seems like most of them require 500+ blocks
creations-chat 2018-12-03 03:05:57 this one flies without the use of any propellers, jets, or rocket engines

help 2018-12-05 02:28:25 how often is the autosave?
help 2018-12-05 02:29:03 I was building a carrier for the carrier ranks for 2 hours, got almost done, left and came back and roblox had broken so I got into a new server and apparently it never autosaved
help 2018-12-05 02:29:15 is this a bug or does autosave just not save very often?
help 2018-12-05 03:33:09 oh
help 2018-12-05 03:33:14 that makes sense, I never spawned it
