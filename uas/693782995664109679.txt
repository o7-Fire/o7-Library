creations-chat 2021-09-11 00:01:08 i wasn't trying to milk upvotes, i was trying to make a sincere memorial of 9/11
help 2021-09-11 00:03:11 i need advice on what i should use for windows (fake windows) on my memorial...
help 2021-09-11 00:03:24 
help 2021-09-11 00:03:36 im trying to improve it to the best memorial, so i can act out my sincerety, cause i am trying to be as sincere as possible
help 2021-09-11 00:04:03 yes
help 2021-09-11 00:05:38 should i use ladders for floor details
creations-chat 2021-09-11 00:06:04 i wasn't... i was trying to make a sincere memorial. if i was making a upvote milker, it would clearly be less detailed, plus no info on the front. My enterprise build wasn't low detailed either. As i said, i respect those who gave their lives during 9/11 (Except the terrorists, they can be excepted). i am not joking
creations-chat 2021-09-11 00:12:01 look, i wasn't trying to insult the dead. i was trying to make a memorial... how many times do i have to say this... i am not one of those milkers that try for upvotes every single fucking holiday. If i were, you would see so many fucking edits of builds i make that are low tier shit that are being milked for upvotes. I am getting pissed now that everyone is denying i was making a sincere memorial for 9/11 when i was trying my best to make a sincere memorial. You haven't seen me posting tutorial builds left right and center, and i made a high effort USS Enterprise by myself, what gives you belief that i am trying to milk 9/11??? huh??? you think im joking???
creations-chat 2021-09-11 00:17:14 imagine not making a memorial on 9/11, imagine not being able to finish a memorial by 9/11, imagine crushing the dreams of people who are trying their best, imagine being so toxic that you have the power to ruin peoples imagination, IMAGINE CAUSING SOMEONE TO BREAK DOWN SO BADLY, IMAGINE RANTING LIKE ATWITTER USER LOOKING FOR DRAMA, IMAGINE DENYING THAT SOMEONE TRIED TO MAKE A SINCERE BUILD
creations-chat 2021-09-11 00:23:00 ya know what, im fucking done with this shit. my mental state is litteraly below sea level and i tried to have a good friday but it looks like some trolls have decided to fucking cause me a bad evening... im so fucking done right now... i can't even try to explain without being slandered like a ton of butchers chopping up a pig
creations-chat 2021-09-11 00:46:13 basically, i just was slandered to a pulp, for making a 9/11 memorial

This dude below me one of the trolls who detrimented my mind
