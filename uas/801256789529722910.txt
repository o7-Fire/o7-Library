events-chat 2022-05-04 15:26:24 <@466793357318815744> can you do my spin
events-chat 2022-05-04 15:37:37 Can I get my one re-roll?
events-chat 2022-05-04 15:38:45 5 torque on a saw will do nothing
events-chat 2022-05-04 15:46:50 I would prefer any of those over red devil
events-chat 2022-05-04 15:49:25 Not in place crazy
events-chat 2022-05-04 15:59:02 Not with the rules for this tourney atleast
events-chat 2022-05-04 16:15:52 Smeee doesn't even have saws irl
events-chat 2022-05-04 16:16:09 No it doesnt
events-chat 2022-05-04 16:16:31 Disc's and saws are very different things
events-chat 2022-05-04 16:16:54 It does not have saws
events-chat 2022-05-04 16:18:34 Bruh how
events-chat 2022-05-04 16:20:11 In what world is this a saw
events-chat 2022-05-04 16:20:27 Go ahead and explain
events-chat 2022-05-04 16:21:24 It's an asymmetrical bar spinner
events-chat 2022-05-04 16:21:50 It's not a saw bro
events-chat 2022-05-04 16:22:20 So Rotator has a saw?
events-chat 2022-05-04 16:22:47 This dude 🤡
events-chat 2022-05-04 16:24:11 A bar and a disc hit things so it can impact
events-chat 2022-05-04 16:24:52 Bruh have u even watched anything related to battlebots 🤡
events-chat 2022-05-04 16:25:32 Saws and disc's are different things
They work completely differently
events-chat 2022-05-04 16:27:22 Oh my gawd this dude 🤡
events-chat 2022-05-04 16:28:04 AI's cutter flipper is a saw now!!!!!
events-chat 2022-05-04 16:30:41 It's pretty obvious u have never seen anything battlebots related
events-chat 2022-05-04 16:33:06 Lmao
events-chat 2022-05-04 16:33:39 Ok 9 year old who talks about things they know nothing about
events-chat 2022-05-04 16:43:54 They are not the same
events-chat 2022-05-04 16:47:24 1000 inertia 50 speed triple motor stack for the weapon
events-chat 2022-05-04 17:52:18 No he is literally proving ur wrong
events-chat 2022-05-04 19:29:27 <@466793357318815744> so is rusty my official roll  or is it still red devil
events-chat 2022-05-04 19:35:39 No
events-chat 2022-05-04 19:36:08 Ok I'll build it with actual tracks
events-chat 2022-05-04 19:36:28 Yeah
events-chat 2022-05-04 19:36:48 I've built tracked bots before
events-chat 2022-05-04 19:37:14 👍
events-chat 2022-05-04 20:23:44 <@466793357318815744> may I have permission to use pistons to tension my tracks?
events-chat 2022-05-04 21:06:00 <:stuff:908917207986208828>
events-chat 2022-05-14 15:36:22 <@466793357318815744> why dont u just skip fights you cant do rn? instead of taking 45 more minutes waiting for one person whos gonna delay the entire thing
events-chat 2022-05-14 16:01:22 how are u trying if you're gonna repeat a match 3 times knowing the same shit will happen every time?
events-chat 2022-05-14 16:56:08 man made the spinner going the wrong way
events-chat 2022-05-14 16:56:34 unfortunate
events-chat 2022-05-14 16:56:51 it spins downward
events-chat 2022-05-14 16:57:10 almost all vertical spinners irl spin upward so they work
events-chat 2022-05-15 17:47:52 
events-chat 2022-05-15 17:53:37 tbf prob 99% of the people cheated, including the host
events-chat 2022-05-15 17:54:56 rbk def cheated intentionally
events-chat 2022-05-15 17:56:33 this tourney was shit
events-chat 2022-05-15 19:23:44 I like how ur complaining about the forks yet the tantrum guy build is so bad it wasnt even fucking orange and had a god damn drum on the ass
events-chat 2022-05-15 19:35:56 he didnt even submit it as an entry so I dont have a pic of it
events-chat 2022-05-15 20:35:57 tbf ur shatter does look like shit
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:25:22 I only got pissed after my opponent got a redo, but then right after u guys stopped redo's and then RBK says you all apparently agreed to stop redos 4 fights before my fight even started
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:25:50 then the previous events must be very shit
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:26:07 yeah
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:26:24 ah
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:28:04 yeah that was dumb
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:28:41 a shell that is actually just an overhead gets 15 more torque
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:31:16 no it just flings everyone
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:33:46 well when the host redos fights when ever he wants because the wrong person won its kinda annoying
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:34:57 idc about the rules I was just complaining about the hosting part lol
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:38:52 its common sense to not use it
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:39:27 it made less fights for you to fly out
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:41:00 nobody was saying anything because nobody thought it was allowed
cuz you never mentioned anything about it
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:43:06 honestly it kinda suppresses all weapon types that rely on big impacts
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:43:22 I found that one out the hard way lmao
