creations-chat 2021-01-07 03:10:53 I wish some of you "elite" builder could respect the finer things in life, not every build will be super detailed, not every builder has all day to practice, some of us have lives to live, some of use are not the BEST builders. Maybe just think about much they sat there, and thought "How could i make this work?" or "This doesnt look right, but this does!" we all struggle sometimes. You guys started out just like the rest of us, build shi**y builds that you thought where cool
creations-chat 2021-01-07 03:15:02 Thanks, godly. I worked my ass off trying to figure out steering for the Albatros
creations-chat 2021-01-07 03:19:33 A lot of these people who down vote simple builds are people who don't understand or don't remember how they started out, they are kids who sit in their room the entire day just building away, and every once in awhile sticking their hands in a bag to grab a few Cheetos, sip some rock star energy, and get back to "work". They just become oblivious that there are people with feelings that have jobs, school, family issues, etc
creations-chat 2021-01-07 03:22:44 Still, just because you started out with excellent building techniques doesn't mean you can learn to respect those who aren't born a natural, some of us just don't automatically start walking out of the womb, some of use need to crawl first.
creations-chat 2021-01-07 03:25:03 Im not upset over a lousy downvote, its just i feel like things just start to get fuzzy as you get better
creations-chat 2021-01-07 03:27:18 You think i havent taken this criticism? You think this is a first? Ive tried, and tried, and tried, ive used info as i went along, trying to get better, its so hard

creations-chat 2021-06-25 16:49:49 Gun position for sure
creations-chat 2021-06-25 16:55:12 Could I have a reference image to the actual thing?
creations-chat 2021-06-25 16:57:50 The front looks a tad wedge-esc, maybe try to use some softer blocks, but looks good! the snow is a great idea!
creations-chat 2021-06-25 16:59:52 Oh sorry! i forgot it was underwater, looks amazing!
creations-chat 2021-06-25 17:03:48 Its not that we dont like it, ok *maybe* we dont, but thats because EVERYBODY makes one and nobody likes being kidnapped, if it was JUST the van it would super cool
creations-chat 2021-06-25 17:08:23 So, what do you guys think of the Killdozer? I know its a bit low-poly but I am not a man of detail, sadly
creations-chat 2021-06-25 17:10:41 Well, thats better than bad, right?
creations-chat 2021-06-25 17:13:18 I personally beleive you shouldn't use anything that kills outside of pvp, its somewhat of a loophole and makes you look like an A-hole, thats just my opinion though
creations-chat 2021-06-25 17:16:40 Or block them via roblox <:FineTroll:626841259746656289>
creations-chat 2021-06-25 17:19:34 Use weighted ballast blocks on the bottom center of the hull
creations-chat 2021-06-25 17:22:21 funny
creations-chat 2021-06-25 17:26:17 I want to see soembody build the old soviet U-475 "Black Widow" famously day viewed in the movie "Black Sea" I suck at subs so not me
creations-chat 2021-06-25 17:30:03 <@!454326458882588685> I used all the listed above to get one of my best creations, you just need to get the right balance, not too heavy, not too light

creations-chat 2021-06-25 17:49:09 If you do it youll regain my respect
creations-chat 2021-06-25 18:38:28 Thanks man!
creations-chat 2021-06-25 18:42:06 I would do that but the armor design on the real thing with the holes would look weird, i can try
creations-chat 2021-06-25 18:44:38 <@!711009848438947850> I need ideas to make it look better, any thoughs?
creations-chat 2021-06-25 18:47:44 i dont see how this will work

creations-chat 2021-06-26 11:41:24 We've all seen WAYYY worse
creations-chat 2021-06-26 11:43:28 ||people who post tutorials that are somehow worse than their own product||
creations-chat 2021-06-26 12:13:43 <@!639596818610651139> My suggestion, make your own landing gear, use cylinders
creations-chat 2021-08-19 21:16:55 who tf uses legacy glass anyways
creations-chat 2021-08-20 00:22:51 I need advice
creations-chat 2021-08-20 00:24:55 I know your joking but I could really use some good advice for building, everytime i make something unique it gets upvoted but I suck at everything else
creations-chat 2021-08-20 00:27:38 I never get advice for my builds <:cryglasses:799629649310122014>
creations-chat 2021-10-09 05:54:05 I have rejoined the server for help on my Bradley, what do I do for this crew hatch? (deceratory)
creations-chat 2021-10-09 05:56:12 Oh yeah! I had trouble with coloring, so some colors are... rarer than others.
creations-chat 2021-10-09 06:35:06 Everybody who uses shredders has like 2g internet
creations-chat 2021-10-10 05:29:53 Suggestions? (And yes I did go back and fix some things on the M2 Bradley) ignore the strange block that is lighter than the others
creations-chat 2021-10-10 05:39:52 Man, I wish people who downvoted creations actually gave feedback! Kinda sad.
creations-chat 2021-10-10 05:45:41 Sorry, I pinged you guys so I can get feedback on my CIWS, I hope you understand, and if you have nothing to say, then I kindly ask you to remove your downvote.
creations-chat 2021-10-10 05:50:51 Build a Volkswagen beetle next to it.
creations-chat 2021-10-10 05:55:25 Thank you! I am trying to take other suggestions into account, but I am having trouble finding a way to make it scale and have hidden internals without it being super large.
creations-chat 2021-10-10 05:57:43 Very good!
