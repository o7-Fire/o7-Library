creations-chat 2023-05-31 01:41:06 i did, it was more effective to send it to creations chat to see how people react to it, since barely anyone does in any of the chats thats meant to showcase wip builds, i just happened to wake yall up
creations-chat 2023-05-31 01:43:30 https://tenor.com/view/surprise-mysterious-gif-25134076
creations-chat 2023-05-31 01:46:44 dam its a work in progress, it doesn't hurt to look at something unpolished for once, dam either some incident happened that considered it a cardinal sin or you guys got nothing to do in your lives
creations-chat 2023-05-31 01:49:59 now im genuinely curious why the response it's such a big deal  or yall just  dont go outside

creations-chat 2023-05-31 01:54:57 I was just trying to find out the greater picture of this rule but its literally just the rule, dam, i don't know why its a rule but its just a rule, shut up and conform is the name of the game huh
creations-chat 2023-05-31 01:57:22 <@814978152672657458> you just compared a crime that disrupt the flow of economy to an unexplained uproar of a wip
creations-chat 2023-05-31 01:59:28 so no one knows why this rule was made in the first place huh?
creations-chat 2023-05-31 02:11:34 show me your best builds so i can shut up now, because i am tired of seeing modern already made builds, i want to see something new for once
creations-chat 2023-05-31 02:15:48 this is mine, it was made a year ago got 170 upvotes, where those new locking techniques wasnt founded yet

creations-chat 2023-06-05 14:57:37 Excellent
creations-chat 2023-06-06 18:58:42 Why are white names hated
creations-chat 2023-06-06 19:00:54 That is true  but oh well, teach em the ways
creations-chat 2023-06-06 19:03:13 Thus the whitenames can't learn and the game can't grow
creations-chat 2023-06-06 19:20:26 <@814978152672657458>  well the 50% who don't got an ego needs help the most should still be assisted instead of made fun of
creations-chat 2023-06-06 19:24:06 <@814978152672657458> we also gotta bring back actual pvp combat
creations-chat 2023-06-06 19:26:27 Time to evolve bitches do we want this game to die or to become evolve the Era of building <@823296173426081862>
creations-chat 2023-06-06 19:29:42 Well ask me for help when building I'm very experienced I just choose to become a Whitename
creations-chat 2023-06-06 19:34:04 Well let's curve this as much as we can before flight point becomes a better plane crazy
creations-chat 2023-06-06 19:42:09 <@814978152672657458> I should make my own pvp good looking design tutorials
creations-chat 2023-06-06 19:44:22 Yes
help 2023-06-06 19:53:07 The grind is too much
creations-chat 2023-06-06 23:27:54 what is happening
creations-chat 2023-06-07 02:14:49 what are you guys arguing about, is it about who can build better or something else?
creations-chat 2023-06-07 02:29:55 really? well ok, anyways can you show the su 57 now?
creations-chat 2023-06-07 02:55:24 hey guys i have an idea to ressurect the game,
we make tutorial builds for noobs
creations-chat 2023-06-07 03:00:16 <@912065912658608190> idk about those,  they are surface level builds, but a very good design tutorial build, that is either custom or made from a game, a design no one has built and seen before but normally when you do that you get a video like this 
which is very time consuminghttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddy_ARC75JM&t=14s&pp=ygUVcGxhbmUgY3JhenkgdHV0b3JpYWxz
creations-chat 2023-06-07 03:04:30 they include all locking techniques that makes a design look good, but here is my proposition what if we make a tutorial that lasts 10 minutes, and its a playlist of parts where it builds the different parts, how they work and why they work<@1001565219828543538>
creations-chat 2023-06-07 03:08:03 There is more, this helps the whitenames and noobs to actually learn how all great detailed builds are built and assembled, thus giving them hope to get good at the game. Furthermore, since pc2 is not being developed for its low return of investment, if everything goes to plan, the playerbase goes up because we gave the noobs a path follow to get good, rick will notice this and actually has a reason to continue development, for its fan base is growing again <@1001565219828543538>
creations-chat 2023-06-07 03:10:14 im telling the people who sees this, as a chance to actually respark the playerbase, you can take this idea and do it however you guys do with it, but i need your help when doing so.
creations-chat 2023-06-07 03:17:40 how you do that, and if you read the idea your a great candidate. if you agree, well you can do whatever you want with the idea.
creations-chat 2023-06-07 03:20:48 <@467459282250629120> if you guys want to actually get this idea in motion, just let me copy your builds, and ill do the rest of the work or we can work together to get it in motion.
creations-chat 2023-06-07 03:22:50 if you want to part of it, ill credit you, your discord and roblox username or whatever that you build it, and i just show the noobs and whitenames how your build works and how its going to get built <@467459282250629120>
creations-chat 2023-06-07 03:25:29 if you me let copy your build and use it for the tutorial and not any of the work to proceed with this idea, then thats the plan
actually i have experience on doing it, <@375281006091173890>  but if we want to get it in motion right away then thats the plan
creations-chat 2023-06-07 03:28:18 i can do it myself, but im giving you an idea that can spark the player base again because the biggest common factor of the game dying is the new players not learning how the game works
and 
1. you dont play the game anymore so you dont matter
2. you don't see the vision i have.
3. if it works, your left with no profits with working with me
but if you insist on not being part of the plan then your loss kid <@375281006091173890>
creations-chat 2023-06-07 03:32:11 <@467459282250629120>  if you haven't realized we post it on youtube, because the biggest demographic of kids are there 
<@375281006091173890>  Your experienced won't be needed since you dont play the game anymore, i gave you an idea and if your too lazy ill do it for you, if your not, use it. Im giving you an oppurtunity to actually use your skills to respark plane crazys playerbase, this is not
an argument, stand down i am making a discussion of how we can get rick to respark his reason to make pc2. Thats what most wants
creations-chat 2023-06-07 03:35:04 pls scroll down i've already explained it <@467459282250629120> 
and <@375281006091173890>  even though your better, i am not a shit builder
the numbers dont lie
creations-chat 2023-06-07 03:37:11 <@778018583686021180> envision the idea and then talk about your opinion
<@467459282250629120>  if you don't want to proceed thats fine i have enough experience to do it myself
why does the responses look like i committed a crime
creations-chat 2023-06-07 03:39:50 OK let me break it down, make a tutorial, a whitename and noobs can build, that looks really good, learn how it works by the instructions of tutorial, each video lasts 10 minutes and its a playlist to build each part. Give them an understanding how great builds are built. IF IT WORKS, rick will actually continue development of pc2, thus we get what we want.
<@467459282250629120>  well lets be professionals and not use emotions, how is that working. Creations chat are littered with basic builds
creations-chat 2023-06-07 03:42:28 <@467459282250629120> that is true, however making A design, is the complicated park, where do they start
<@375281006091173890>  you just proved my point, The game is dead, this idea resparks it, he signed a contract to make better profits elsewhere.
If you don't understand roblox takes 90% of your profits from your game, furthermore the learning curve of the game is VERY difficult and im offering a solution
<@778018583686021180>  i digress what the creations chat presents
creations-chat 2023-06-07 03:48:55 now lets anylize why the idea is bad and how we can make it better, <@467459282250629120>  its not the locking its the foundation of the design, where do they start, not everyone is jet enthusiast,
<@375281006091173890>  developing a game is a job, and since its not worth it to make profit here its gone, 
2. everyone is lazy nothing has been done, if you want a testimonial then i will agree to do it
3. You cannot be part of it if your being very uninformative to improve the idea, i have experienced in video editing and design spaceships myself for some time, and a starter 3d modeler, i have merit.
this discussion wasnt designed to be offensive, if you really want to go down that path, many of the 5th level designers are REPLICATORS, NOT DESIGNERS
in short words, most of yall haven''t envisioned a design and replicated pre existing builds
creations-chat 2023-06-07 04:05:06 we can discuss it on the the hangar but you left and plus you arugements are literally trying to put holes on an idea not build on it <@375281006091173890>  come on man,
creations-chat 2023-06-07 04:08:34 who is that, but please enlighten, if you want to troll
creations-chat 2023-06-07 04:10:37 <@738979597323862048>  check your dms i can give you that or we can vc on why its not good
creations-chat 2023-06-07 04:20:00 because the profits of pc1 is ASS, 70% of your profits go to roblox not them
creations-chat 2023-06-07 04:30:54 
the-dump 2023-06-07 04:37:26 MOST 5TH EXPERT DESIGNERS CAN'T DESIGN
CHANGE MY MIND
the-dump 2023-06-07 04:47:48 i only say few designs that are custom
the-dump 2023-06-07 04:47:50 most all replicated
creations-chat 2023-06-08 02:23:51 guys, are yall whitenames by choice?
creations-chat 2023-06-08 02:41:00 do you put materials on it
creations-chat 2023-06-10 01:17:36 im back
creations-chat 2023-06-10 03:42:38 something is wrong with this game
creations-chat 2023-06-10 03:48:32 I cant assemble my ship without getting 10k ping and more
my pc is high end
creations-chat 2023-06-10 03:50:57 well supposedly, it would be my first tutorial build im gonna upload  but idk about user friendliness now
creations-chat 2023-06-10 03:53:04 its a tutorial build where they learn, ship consists of storing a car, has vtol, improvised hover system, has 2 bedrooms, can reverse, has quantum drive, 
includes, most of locking systems
creations-chat 2023-06-10 03:56:00 its a chance to start something new in this era on this game, ill make how to design guide, cause thats hard, except if your replicating
creations-chat 2023-06-10 03:59:15 well thats already been tried, plus give the kids its an inspiration to use their own mind,  give em a physical model, that they can interact, so they can replicate the tutorial build on their next design but this time they design it their own
<@690931622345834527>  you got better ideas, we aint getting pc2 unless we respark the game again
creations-chat 2023-06-10 04:03:42 well, you got a better idea <@690931622345834527>
creations-chat 2023-06-10 04:05:45 So then, how do we grow the fanbase if no one thinks of something new, anything is viable at this point
creations-chat 2023-06-10 04:08:32 yep im having that problem too, gives me 10k ping or more when using it in big builds
<@690931622345834527>  thats the problem, we can't get plane crazy 2, it seems rick has halted all development because the profits aren't worth it rn
freelancing devs isnt an option either, hence first reason
creations-chat 2023-06-10 04:10:49 well being sitting ducks aint gonna help either, theres gotta be a way
<@523003901075521536>  whats the issue though, is it the lag part or something else
creations-chat 2023-06-10 04:13:04 <@523003901075521536> show build?
creations-chat 2023-06-10 04:17:39 <@523003901075521536> which one out of the two has biggest block count
creations-chat 2023-06-10 04:20:38 oh shii, the plane, if that thing has 50 piston i wonder how am gonna make this thing
creations-chat 2023-06-10 04:22:50 if his is lagging, yours will crash and will be unplayable
creations-chat 2023-06-10 04:28:06 cant use hoverdrives on my dropship for clean lift no more, this is my largest build so far, only has 6 pistons and it lags like crazy
not done
creations-chat 2023-06-10 04:31:04 @<@775918490146177024> i believe we can still fly them, but no one can ride along with us.
creations-chat 2023-06-10 05:29:41 <@839668493602652182>  show build
creations-chat 2023-06-10 05:32:07 doesn't look like an su57, thats why 
you have to smoothen things out, so it actually looks like one, also more pictures help it view all sides, with orthographic view
mainly the pertruding sides of the thrusters
creations-chat 2023-06-10 08:56:24 <@443752316240265226> Materials is key to making your builds look good,
do it right, and it will look like this 
also you not need to change building style to get more upvotes,
the new era demands, fluid, detailed, and sleek designs
creations-chat 2023-06-10 09:00:26 <@443752316240265226>you can do both unless its pvp
creations-chat 2023-06-10 16:33:05 <@449197903609856001> if your new mention me for help
creations-chat 2023-06-10 16:47:00 <@817301154077474816>  What is it supposed to look like

Hide the rockets inside the turret so the the gun doesn't look ugly, also give the tank more depth and give every details a purpose on how this tank is it going to be used. Is it a mbt that provides all needs for the crew and soldiers it supports or is it an undercover stealth tank?
creations-chat 2023-06-12 20:25:28 <@694267776637861999>  why?
creations-chat 2023-06-12 20:46:42 Well, try make the cannons look good while having the weapons at the same time, your gonna be forced to put the weapons inside so the gun looks good, 
details is important so it gives the build depth and purpose for its use

help 2023-06-14 19:29:35 <@610446020018700289> that's up to you how this design was made for
creations-chat 2023-06-14 19:35:05 What happened guys
help 2023-06-14 19:36:18 <@610446020018700289>  ok now put materials that would fit the ship pretty well, cause right now it's all 1 material and it's smooth plastic
help 2023-06-15 05:10:09 <@963513431045046323> its doing that because when accelerating it, it generates force of whereever is thrusting, that is because the thrusters is located in the very top, i believe the fix for this, use hover thrusters and put them to 15 drag set them to control 0 and no speed, so you can give more balance to ship
help 2023-06-15 05:10:37 so you now need to distribute the ballast blocks, helium and hover thrusters until it gives you the desired balance
help 2023-06-15 05:29:19 <@793829260347310090> yes
help 2023-06-15 05:29:23 or what problem you having now
help 2023-06-15 05:31:50 <@793829260347310090>  helicopter is thrusting down because there is no counterweight on the back
help 2023-06-15 05:32:54 more ballast on the back
help 2023-06-15 05:33:45 if you added the ballast blocks now
help 2023-06-15 05:33:47 try flying again
help 2023-06-15 05:33:55 if not
help 2023-06-15 05:34:03 add more hover thrusters and wing pannels on the front
help 2023-06-15 05:37:27 i believe you added too much
creations-chat 2023-06-15 23:02:06 <@912065912658608190> what's wrong either copying, you should be grateful that your work is very reliable with everything and they can use that to make their own builds
creations-chat 2023-06-16 00:13:45 <@912065912658608190> copying, doesn't mean bad thing, it means people like what you built and want to have your reliable work, they want to copy because they want the model for themselves and use it for fun, and soon use it to make their own builds.
If were gonna talk about copying, lets take into account that 80% of good builders do that in this game.
