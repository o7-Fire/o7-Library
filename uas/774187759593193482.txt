creations-chat 2022-08-16 03:44:01 hot ü•µ
creations-chat 2022-08-16 11:58:13 Seems like an interesting future build idea ü§î
creations-chat 2022-08-18 12:35:12 this reminds me of that time when I was so bored in class i folded paper like 30 or 40 times
creations-chat 2022-08-18 12:52:19 It was a big sheet of paper-
creations-chat 2022-08-19 11:14:05 I'll try make the aircraft carrier
creations-chat 2022-08-19 11:32:33 it is.
creations-chat 2022-08-22 04:21:20 the guns should be inside of the turret other wise it looks pretty mid
creations-chat 2022-08-23 02:38:51 progress with the carrier ( i will change how the catapults are put in cause it keeps on glitching)
creations-chat 2022-08-24 08:55:36 ideas? (catapult will be moved somewhere, its just there temporarily)
creations-chat 2022-08-24 08:58:11 Custom, its IJN Taiho modernized to 1960 standards
creations-chat 2022-08-24 09:00:33 this is the reference image i used

creations-chat 2022-09-08 01:47:58 I am just spawning in some of my old builds and he thinks Im flexing.... it all started when I spawned in my tiger and he spawned in his
creations-chat 2022-09-08 11:04:29 ü•∞
creations-chat 2022-09-10 00:00:14 I fucken knew that this was stolen, I literally saw the original build last month and inspired me to redo my Bismarck. Its a shame people do this ngl
creations-chat 2022-09-10 08:41:14 
creations-chat 2022-09-10 08:43:55 
creations-chat 2022-09-11 12:41:54 Possibly its because of the good builders are busy
creations-chat 2022-09-11 12:44:38 I mean for some people like me its exam week, there really isn't much time to build when your grades are on the line...
creations-chat 2022-09-17 12:12:08 
creations-chat 2022-09-18 03:14:05 Amateur
creations-chat 2022-09-18 03:17:54 That was supposed to be a joke and not feedback but okay
creations-chat 2022-09-19 23:32:01 Just one more eye and this can be considered a cars character
creations-chat 2022-09-21 11:38:33 May I ask for the settings? I have never heard about that glitch before
creations-chat 2022-09-22 00:15:05 why the hell are the ailerons in the damn center
creations-chat 2022-09-23 04:50:40 What the hell
creations-chat 2022-09-23 10:37:56 what the hell is that kind of helicopter
creations-chat 2022-09-25 03:21:02 Gotta grab some tea for this one
creations-chat 2022-09-25 07:10:57 Hot
creations-chat 2022-09-26 01:26:45 be careful for what you wish for, as you may be part of those kids
creations-chat 2022-09-26 01:31:43 I mean, your the one laughing at white names here, when you used to be one yourself. Also to think people on the internet are telling the truth is just a fruitless endeavor
creations-chat 2022-09-30 00:50:54 Taking kamikazes to a whole new level
help 2022-09-30 10:08:51 This only works only if you have a anchored block activated
help 2022-09-30 10:09:05 if you dont have an anchor block then it flings itself to mach 10
creations-chat 2022-10-01 10:15:23 Some panther that I probably forgot to finish
creations-chat 2022-10-01 13:00:46 It looks like pimples on an aircraft üíÄ
creations-chat 2022-10-02 01:19:56 Hmm...
creations-chat 2022-10-03 03:35:00 what is this
creations-chat 2022-10-03 05:28:07 Looks like a wehraboo's wet dream. Imma make it
creations-chat 2022-10-04 11:33:13 For some reason when im really busy I want to build something, then when my free time arrives my motivation is just gone
creations-chat 2022-10-04 23:17:04 The wings look too thick
creations-chat 2022-10-05 09:20:38 Remake the entire damn thing, the wings should be half a block taller and use motor lock to fill in the ugly gaps between the fuselage and the wings
creations-chat 2022-10-05 10:03:27 I'm on my damn phone rn, I'd show pictures but what I said was right, the whole thing needs to be reworked
creations-chat 2022-10-05 10:08:51 Its not like your giving useful feedback anyways, and like what I said, I'd have a better time explaining it on my PC, and saying that I am not a decent person when I'm actually trying to help these new people unlike you people who just laughs at them?
creations-chat 2022-10-05 10:13:06 The mods are only here to moderate, if the mods are here to help new players on how to build properly they should be named helpers instead. Wasn't it supposed to be the creations chat that was supposed to help them and yet it turned into a circus to make fun of them?
creations-chat 2022-10-06 06:06:18 Should I go for a cylinder cockpit or a wedges cockpit for my su 57?
creations-chat 2022-10-06 08:19:03 Su-57 [WIP]
creations-chat 2022-10-06 08:23:14 springs and the remants of a half block ladder because the motor lock tower got too high
creations-chat 2022-10-06 09:22:01 Jesus christ that looks more rough than what i imagined
creations-chat 2022-10-06 09:35:47 I'll try to make it more smooth
creations-chat 2022-10-06 10:42:00 I guess thats better
creations-chat 2022-10-06 11:00:41 Time to rework it again i guess
creations-chat 2022-10-06 11:40:36 I just need to smooth it out (I just realized I was looking at the wrong angle when using reference images üíÄ)
creations-chat 2022-10-06 11:46:23 I need to shorten it again do i
creations-chat 2022-10-06 11:50:50 Better? or does it need more tuning?
creations-chat 2022-10-06 11:53:43 Sorry for the unintentional scarring with that horrific nose btw
creations-chat 2022-10-06 11:56:48 do I remove the extra angle (The one that is protruding out of the top of the nose) or keep it? 

<@504577008383033344> aight
creations-chat 2022-10-06 12:00:03 I may have made it look more like an f22 than a su 57 (Possibly made it more stealthier ngl)
creations-chat 2022-10-06 12:05:58 Actually the reason why I sucked at  making the nose was because this is my first modern jet that I made 
(My best looking plane being the bf-109)
creations-chat 2022-10-06 12:08:50 Literally went from mono planes to 4.5 gen jet fighters real quick
creations-chat 2022-10-07 11:28:59 Playing plane crazy on 3000 ping rn (the delay is horrid)
creations-chat 2022-10-08 23:04:10 I wonder how a battleship would look like with the main guns switched with tank turrets
creations-chat 2022-10-09 07:16:21 sea with no water
creations-chat 2022-10-09 22:56:04 Click on the back of the text, that should work
creations-chat 2022-10-10 07:58:53 Thoughts? Su-57 WIP
creations-chat 2022-10-10 08:44:21 Try to find the another place to hide the motor lock, cause as of rn it looks like its going thru puberty
creations-chat 2022-10-10 23:33:45 This is triggering some sort of phobia I have that I forgot the name of
creations-chat 2022-10-11 11:51:59 Thanks roblox üëç (I cannot use another letter beside it cause it will ruin the design)
creations-chat 2022-10-11 11:54:50 A bit too late cause my ctrl + v got glitched and doesnt work
creations-chat 2022-10-11 23:37:36 
creations-chat 2022-10-13 02:05:50 Which one is better? (Su 57)
creations-chat 2022-10-14 01:38:03 Doesnt everyone use reference images üóø
creations-chat 2022-10-14 02:03:16 Should I use cam lock for angles? (sort of getting tired of having to respawn when I mess up an angle a bit)
creations-chat 2022-10-14 02:58:38 Thoughts? (I'll try to smooth out the front)
creations-chat 2022-10-14 03:16:02 ?
creations-chat 2022-10-14 03:22:43 I dont have sparkler lol
creations-chat 2022-10-15 10:29:06 Wow.... I am honestly surprised they called it that
creations-chat 2022-10-16 12:48:34 They will simply learn the hard way
creations-chat 2022-10-16 13:18:28 Looks more rougher than a rock
creations-chat 2022-10-16 23:17:35 Sanity for the average discord user
creations-chat 2022-10-17 03:36:34 ü§å
creations-chat 2022-10-22 09:24:22 No one cares about that, looks and complexity is regarded highly, and magnetic drives, conveyor drives are just the stuff that literally have tutorials for them. stuff like a working calculator, although ugly. but if it works it will be very well liked.
creations-chat 2022-10-24 10:36:47 üóø
creations-chat 2022-10-26 12:51:30 Fuselage looks tiny compared to the wings
creations-chat 2022-10-26 23:40:42 <@577930642520801301> Looks nothing like it, The engines dont even protrude out, the fuselage needs to be elongated and the width increased a bit, also dont use that type of control surface, it looks ugly. use control surfaces and motor lock it into the wings so its not seen
creations-chat 2022-10-29 12:39:22 I want to die. My first time trying to make a smooth hull (KMS Scharnhorst WIP)
