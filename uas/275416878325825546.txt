plane-crazy 2020-04-09 04:07:13 Yeah, I am pretty sure the trails are only for the user who has them on their build
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 03:26:23 Oh, ok
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 03:25:37 Just curious, but are the trails clientside only?
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 19:27:25 Well, if you are planning on building one, best of luck
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 19:25:33 XD
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 19:25:32 Yeah, but WaTeRwHeElS
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 19:25:04 Oh. ok then
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 19:24:44 Though you could probably attach a water wheel to another using a suspension to make gears...
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 19:23:37 Not sure
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 19:21:16 Oh woah, cool platformer
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 15:31:14 Well, I made the parrot
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 13:29:57 Not sure, just grasping at straws tbh
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 13:29:36 Probably because before you saved it, it was void, but then when you saved it, it actually had an empty space saved onto it?
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 13:24:59 Building a dancing parrot using pistons
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 13:24:42 Oh, Darkz, your profile picture just gave me an idea XD
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 13:23:00 ( Unless this is already possible, not played yet )
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 13:22:53 Though I wonder if it would ever be possible to only use certain ones at a time
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 13:21:27 Well, if they get worked on, then it could be very interesting
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 13:20:31 Also, very late I know, but I just saw the new mouse follow motors and ooooooh...
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 13:18:39 Interesting to see how people also build non-vehicle creations. Sorta nice sometimes
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 13:17:06 Cool
