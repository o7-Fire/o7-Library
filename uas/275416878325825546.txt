creations-chat 2019-10-17 01:42:51 I can make it weaker or stronger
creations-chat 2019-10-17 01:43:10 AGH. I forgot to add the coin slots T_T
creations-chat 2019-10-17 02:19:18 I like it
creations-chat 2019-10-17 02:19:46 I hope it does not lag too bad or it may brick your computer
bug-reports 2019-12-18 04:43:45 I just found a very weird bug. I have two build plates to my name, but can only use the blue one. The build is still loaded on both though...

bug-reports 2019-12-18 04:45:42 This takes place on a PVP server. I had joined previously for a short amount of time, used the creation once, then left to try to join a new PVP server
bug-reports 2019-12-18 04:45:56 Oh, ok, sorry

Reason: Disrupting players, trolling, knocking players off the world, possible lag machine
( They built a large glitchy whip thing that glitches everywhere and hits people even if they were still in build mode. They refused to stop when they were asked to )

creations-chat 2021-07-06 01:14:22 I just think the slimes looked cute and I wanted to make something that hops
creations-chat 2021-07-06 01:16:28 I thought it took effort, jeez. I just posted it because I was happy with how it turned out, guess I was wrong
