creations-chat 2022-12-21 20:38:07 opinions on the Junkers G.38 D-APIS?
creations-chat 2022-12-21 20:40:18 doubt anyone has made an G38, asked loads of people and nobody has ever heard of the damn thing lol, take my J1000 for example
creations-chat 2022-12-21 20:42:51 oh neat
creations-chat 2022-12-21 20:45:01 still havent seen an torumekian armored corvette ever tho, goodlook finding one of those lol
creations-chat 2022-12-21 20:51:12 what? its a sick plane!

creations-chat 2022-12-21 21:31:42 me looking at the builds i spent blood, sweat and tears making just to see it get downvoted 4 - 9 (atleast my corvette is going positive!)
creations-chat 2022-12-21 21:34:18 still sad to see the corvette being hated, imo its a fucking sick looking plane
creations-chat 2022-12-21 21:36:25 its one of those builds that are like, its old so finding good material for it is annoying, in the sense that its from an anime and not a movie which you can get the model for
the-dump 2022-12-21 23:11:50 name the flag <:clueless:942802644043464734>
creations-chat 2022-12-22 11:28:35 for what ive attempted at recreating its pretty accurate right? (envelope looks different because most of the source images i used had an envelope shaped that way)
creations-chat 2022-12-22 11:40:29 i mean the overall color of the tiger moth is fairly bland, just being yk "brown"
creations-chat 2022-12-22 11:43:26 <:4Weird:709084058721714324>
creations-chat 2022-12-22 11:46:24 yeah i know, but considering the fucking nightmare that my g38 is when it comes to motor locking i doubt i would have much luck with the skull and lettering
creations-chat 2022-12-22 11:48:25 but looking back at the 3 other tiger moths that have been posted in this server i can say mine atleast has the general shape of it
creations-chat 2022-12-22 11:54:44 what yall think of the SS Great Eastern?

creations-chat 2022-12-22 14:56:26 ive made the porco rosso plane, along with that pirate one with the tail that lacks paint, armored corvette from nausicaa, along with the bumblecrow and the gunship, made air destroyer goliath along with the tiger moth, and had an attempt at the pre dreadnought lookin ship from howls moving castle, along with 2 of the airships from it, plus the little flying thingy that has those bug like wings that keep it in the air (aero kayak) <:clueless:942802644043464734>
creations-chat 2022-12-22 15:00:42 corvette compare <:clueless:942802644043464734>
creations-chat 2022-12-22 15:05:00 i guess you could say i made the G38 from the wind rises considering that plane is in it, but the same would go for the transaero i have lol (fuck it didnt embed)
creations-chat 2022-12-22 15:09:55 love it to see there is another corvette out there, thought i was the only one who had made one 😅
creations-chat 2022-12-22 15:13:13 tried making the bumble crow once, yk the massive one which gets shot down in the convoy, turned out kinda shit
creations-chat 2022-12-22 15:15:28 i mean this turned out alright i guess
creations-chat 2022-12-22 15:18:21 tried making that one, gave up (but i do have the pre dreadnought looking ship tho)
creations-chat 2022-12-22 15:20:34 this one (im aware it lacks color) (and its pretty old)
creations-chat 2022-12-22 15:22:55 some really shit attempt at air destroyer goliath, guna make it way better (and bigger) when pc2 comes out

creations-chat 2022-12-22 21:12:00 which one?
creations-chat 2022-12-22 21:14:24 ah yes the KX-3, it isnt exactly the most colorful plane, its just *green*
creations-chat 2022-12-23 00:08:47 yeah that's what I was referring to

creations-chat 2022-12-23 10:39:14 isnt really boring to use, can fly really fast and is super mobile, best part is when you fly in and blast some helicopter out of the sky with the rockets under the fuselage, not a super boring plane imo (it can hover like a VTOL aswell)

creations-chat 2022-12-23 21:19:00 bad all around? bet you wouldnt say the same to the other bv238's that have been made and posted in this server, atleast mine is to scale, unlike half of the ones here that are 1/3 or 1/2 scale, atleast i BOTHER putting time into making my plane so that its to scale, and not some tiny ass one that kinda defeats the purpose of the plane
creations-chat 2022-12-23 21:22:29 tell me, would you say the same for this?

creations-chat 2022-12-23 21:40:52 and this plane is innacurate how exactly?
creations-chat 2022-12-23 21:44:00 they generally are quite thick, they have cabins inside of them so...
creations-chat 2022-12-23 21:52:24 had no room to make the cables sorry, the landing gear itself is folded at the bottom because of how the wings are folded there is no more room to have the landing gear be straight
creations-chat 2022-12-23 21:55:29 motor lock is horrid, trying to work with limited space around the aircraft that doesn require branching out (also its called making it to scale and not some shitty 1/3 scale version you idiot)
creations-chat 2022-12-23 21:59:20 opinions on the corvette?
creations-chat 2022-12-23 22:04:20 yeah it does a bit, its from a 80s anime lol, it was shit in the movie, got shot down with a single shot from a gunship, bursted into flames and plumited to the ground
creations-chat 2022-12-23 22:06:26 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4iS7fIeYlE here it is if you wanted to see it get shot down (2:43 is the timestamp) altho you can already see it on the thumbnail lol

creations-chat 2022-12-28 20:41:51 considering entirely remaking this plane for the 3rd time, using motor lock and getting the proportions spot on
creations-chat 2022-12-30 00:08:09 does using engines for hovering/propulsion on a vtol aircraft effect aeronautical role? As in it says cannot use engines for propulsion only wings, and the plane I had in mind making uses engines to hover
creations-chat 2022-12-30 00:15:17 okay good, issue now is getting the plane stable without helium,  look at this goofy ass, doesn't even have a tail
creations-chat 2022-12-30 00:19:55 I mean I've built it twice (with helium) but the proportions are a bit off (nose to sharp and shit) which is why I wonna remake it
creations-chat 2022-12-30 00:39:40 it's an armored corvette, it's a pretty large plane lol, it has like 2 floors (I think)
creations-chat 2022-12-30 00:43:09 torumekian armored corvette (it's a plane)
creations-chat 2022-12-30 00:45:21 I mean considering it has like 8 gunner stations I'd say its pretty armored (3 at back, 4 at front and 2 ontop)
creations-chat 2022-12-30 00:47:24 it also has 4 self guiding rockets underneath the fuselage/nose
creations-chat 2022-12-30 00:52:17 it's also a vtol and is also super maneuverable, + having a bay for dropping off soldiers into combat
creations-chat 2022-12-30 00:57:20 try answering this and tell me why it has such poor downvotes lol
creations-chat 2022-12-30 01:00:16 details lack in areas such as?
creations-chat 2022-12-30 01:03:14 I mean the original main plane is over a year old, so I'm planning to entirely remake it (for a 3rd time) ironing out all of the issues (also the trail on the nose is there on purpose) (and on the wing)
creations-chat 2022-12-30 01:31:59 these ones?

creations-chat 2023-01-25 17:08:39 thoughts on this sorta iffy attempt on an SR-72? (im aware its not perfect but its aight for my standards) i mean its a massive improvement to the original version of the plane i had made, way smoother in most areas, this builds is still being worked on but this is a good point im at id thought id show
creations-chat 2023-01-25 17:15:59 i already saw this coming lmao (also i just noticed the wing panels sticking out of the rear end of the aircraft <:nooo:787097964946259978>)
creations-chat 2023-01-25 17:20:41 this is what it looks like before you complain (im aware mine isnt as sharp)
creations-chat 2023-01-25 17:26:09 doubt there is one because this plane doesnt exist (its basically a concept thats been considered) altho the design has been shown so im guessing there might be one
