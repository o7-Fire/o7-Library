creations-chat 2021-12-18 14:01:19 ok
creations-chat 2021-12-18 14:07:07 second
creations-chat 2021-12-18 14:10:57 1k when want to escape from fast enemies, normal speed is only around 500. forgot to mention
creations-chat 2021-12-18 14:13:24 I tried not to make it a tube but it came out like this. I know the part behind the cockpit isnt supposed to be a tube, but i didnt put enough space to let me have custom angle wedges
creations-chat 2021-12-18 14:15:29 ofc i will do that im just here asking for feedback so i can add other things
creations-chat 2021-12-18 14:17:32 I was here for feedback not ur constant bickering
creations-chat 2021-12-18 14:20:12 he's just complaining about the tube
i was here for things to add and maybe change
not "why is it a tube"
"still why is it a tube"
"why does it go so fast"
feedback should be like 
"Decrease the speed to be realistic"
Maybe we have different definitions of "polite"
creations-chat 2021-12-18 14:29:38 for god's sake you still want to carry on
creations-chat 2021-12-19 03:02:59 Improved Supermarine Spitfire after an argument yesterday. Not a tube anymore lol. Added engine on the nose. Forgot to remove the custom-angled nose, looking for second opinion and feedback.
creations-chat 2021-12-19 03:34:58 Either it's me, or there's some helium sticking out of the nose. I don't know if its supposed to be there for the nose, but if it's not, you can fit it in the nose

Can anyone help explain? I was flying my plane and the control surfaces are affected by the A and D keys, moving in the respective direction. I'm using a light (0.15 ballast block weight) tutorial plane to demonstrate the phenomenon.

help 2022-01-23 13:54:27 the mouse is in the dead centre of the screen and I dont have any landing gears placed. I also dont see any external forces that may be pushing the plane

creations-chat 2022-01-26 05:42:54 Any thoughts on this cockpit?
creations-chat 2022-01-26 05:46:43 I can make the ring/dividers glass, but I cant make them wing panels because I've used half wedges (both from "wedges" and "half blocks"), and there aren't any wings that support those gradients.
creations-chat 2022-01-26 05:49:26 So I can basically make it like this
creations-chat 2022-01-26 05:52:18 Sorry but the slowmode ðŸ™‚

creations-chat 2022-01-27 06:26:06 gods of the plane crazy community, should I build a v-22 osprey (double tiltrotor) or a v-44 QTR (quad tiltrotor) or a v-66 HTR (Hex Tiltrotor)
idk if the v-66 is called the HTR but its a hex tiltrotor so why not
also the v-44 and v-66 are all concept, only the v-22 is a real think
creations-chat 2022-01-27 09:53:21 does anyone know the color code for the v-22 osprey?
the whitey-blue color of the body
creations-chat 2022-01-27 10:08:36 thx
yeah really nice
can sue for camo too
creations-chat 2022-01-28 05:18:06 Feedback for this V-66 Hexa Tiltrotor? It's supposed to be able to carry 5 times more load than the Chinook and a bit less than the Mil Mi-26. Flies extremely stable. Ofc cant carry much load, only 6 passengers and 1 co-pilots.
ALSO IGNORE THE NOTIFICATION

help 2022-02-26 04:54:26 Is it just me or does the speed setting on the hover thruster not affect the speed you get when using them? I'm getting 1100 sps on both 1 speed 25 drag and 15 speed 25 drag
help 2022-02-26 04:54:33 Is it something with the drag?

creations-chat 2022-02-26 12:37:12 reduce the angle you lock at i guess
creations-chat 2022-02-27 06:02:25 Are these vertical wings too high? I've based it off a Mikoyan PAK DP or a Mig-41, a 6th Gen Fighter. I couldn't find any actual reference pictures, so I tried to mix them together
creations-chat 2022-02-27 06:05:15 hmm ok thanks
