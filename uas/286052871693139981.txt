bug-reports 2018-11-23 01:12:32 I didn't flip them while placing so I don't know why they're moving in different directions
bug-reports 2018-11-23 01:13:38 You're saying they're not supposed to go the same direction...?
bug-reports 2018-11-23 01:13:57 Then in what configuration
bug-reports 2018-11-23 01:14:18 Because this didn't happen to me before
bug-reports 2018-11-23 01:14:21 and my plane flew perfectly
bug-reports 2018-11-23 01:14:36 Now that it's happening my plane won't even fly
bug-reports 2018-11-23 01:22:02 https://gyazo.com/05142ee18b9fe0a2a9a49a49cb9fac25.gif
bug-reports 2018-11-23 01:22:14 So I joined a different server and the flaps are moving differently again now
bug-reports 2018-11-23 01:22:21 Can this be fixed or something
bug-reports 2018-11-23 02:00:12 But they moved in the same direction and my plane worked fine
bug-reports 2018-11-23 02:00:16 Now it doesn’t work
bug-reports 2018-11-23 02:00:21 <@!260534086400081920>
bug-reports 2018-11-23 08:06:23 
bug-reports 2018-11-23 08:07:12 It took off before
bug-reports 2018-11-23 08:07:29 Nothing has changed between before and now
bug-reports 2018-11-23 08:07:52 It flew very well
bug-reports 2018-11-23 08:08:01 with a max speed of 500
bug-reports 2018-11-23 08:08:19 The only problem now is that the control surfaces don't work like they used to before
bug-reports 2018-11-23 08:08:29 and so the plane never takes off
creations-chat 2018-11-24 18:01:16 It’s a category role

creations-chat 2019-01-03 17:17:27 Yeah he literally copied it from the pictures
creations-chat 2019-01-03 17:18:44 There’s no skill involved in that build
creations-chat 2019-01-03 17:19:15 He had pictures and instructions
creations-chat 2019-01-03 17:19:30 Even instructions on how to configure the thing and fly it
creations-chat 2019-01-03 17:23:01 So you’re saying that the person is worthy enough to be recognized as a technician because he built a vtol with its instructions right in front of his face
creations-chat 2019-01-03 17:24:34 Your judgement is fucked up
