creations-chat 2021-10-19 01:01:24 the first ever propellor plane (that i built)
creations-chat 2021-10-19 01:04:25 (i am high on crack)
creations-chat 2021-10-24 13:34:05 hypothetically if i were to submit this jet for a server role would the motorlocked rocket engines count towards part count
creations-chat 2021-10-24 13:38:23 thanks for the feedback, your input will contribute to the making of this jet ü§†
creations-chat 2021-10-24 13:42:25 ok, rocket in the SHAPE of a jet that rotates its wings slightly for dramatically increased maneuverability
creations-chat 2021-10-24 14:07:20 i honestly have no fucking idea but it goes fast and dodges easily in pvp mode so it works for me
creations-chat 2021-10-24 14:11:08 a much more visually appealing photo

creations-chat 2021-10-24 14:45:07 acronym pending (havent come up with one yet)
creations-chat 2021-10-24 14:53:04 i actually appreciate the criticism and bullying on my build; it was much deserved
creations-chat 2021-10-24 14:55:05 yeah but they were literally explaining WHY my build was shit instead of just calling it shit; that's what criticism is for, to help you (me) get better.
creations-chat 2021-10-24 14:57:21 it wasn't harrassment it was criticism
creations-chat 2021-10-28 16:32:17 played the game for 2 years now and i'm still dogshit but it's my first time making a car with *effort* (even if it's not very much) put into the suspension. please tell me how to refine it i have no idea what i'm doing lol
creations-chat 2021-10-28 16:34:57 it's barely different from basic suspensions at all. the only thing differing it is I have an unpowered motor attached to a rope on each side (with a rope down the center to try to prevent the vertical ones from dragging on the floor) it's really not that good and i could use alot of advice on how to NOT make it dogshit lol. i haven't even implemeneted turning yet lol
creations-chat 2021-10-28 16:43:40 is it not allowed to? it's just a land vehicle that i'm trying to do a suspension test with
creations-chat 2021-10-28 16:48:54 i wouldn't want to live in that
creations-chat 2021-10-29 16:31:57 working on a new suspension system for a car. pls give criticism i have no idea wtf im doing

creations-chat 2021-10-29 18:09:33 made a chainsaw. how do i make it so that the treads dont randomly disconnect from the thing that spins them
creations-chat 2021-10-29 18:12:46 thanks for the feedback; it will be used to improve my creation
help 2021-10-29 18:13:17 the treads either just don't spin or when they do spin, they decide to come off of the motor in like 5 seconds (chainsaw)
help 2021-10-29 18:13:37

creations-chat 2022-05-05 14:38:19 i have some prototype rockets which are just modified shredderbugs attached to a disconnector but i'm gonna experiment with some more compact designs
creations-chat 2022-05-05 14:40:12 well it does make the tf2 minigun rev sound when I spin the barrels and the minigun firing sound when i hold m1
creations-chat 2022-05-05 14:42:02 i have no idea what a mitsubishi f-1 is. that being said, 2 looks better, especially if you plan on putting a cutter at the very front or something
