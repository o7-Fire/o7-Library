creations-chat 2021-07-10 17:25:26 does anyone have any ideas on how to improve on this auto loader design?
creations-chat 2021-07-10 17:28:05 what would that do aside from lowering the speed of the shell and lowering the lag
creations-chat 2021-07-10 17:31:43 i only made this thing so it could go through blacklists boxes and it can
creations-chat 2021-07-10 17:33:50 pretty much can anything that gets hit and doesn't have the shell go straight through it gets flung to the 5th dimension
creations-chat 2021-07-11 07:47:38 ah sorry should i delete it
creations-chat 2021-07-11 07:50:51 meh ill finish it then post it have it going through a blacklist for now and no he wasnt spawned in
creations-chat 2021-07-11 07:55:25 the shell is really fast i found this was possible on one of my older guns i think if i goes above 3000 or 2000 and is small enough it can go through
creations-chat 2021-07-11 07:57:46 run across the map then take the time times by 40 cus 40 studs a second and then time the amount of time the shell takes to go across the map (abt 1 or a bit less) then distance/time to find a rough estimation i dont use a seat mostly cus the loader wont load it can the player weighs quite a bit
creations-chat 2021-07-11 08:28:39 idk i mean at least it recorded

creations-chat 2022-08-22 22:20:30 Does anyone have any recommendations on how to make this turret look better, this is my first time trying to make something good looking? Like detailing or the colour pallet. btw this is based off the strv 2000 and has a working autoloader
creations-chat 2022-08-22 22:22:33 ye for anyone interested
creations-chat 2022-08-22 22:24:57 I dont have it being loaded since I can't be bothered to film another one, You can probs figure out how it works anywas
creations-chat 2022-08-22 22:27:02 nuh uh cutters (buggy too)are too much of a bother to load since they aren't round and explosives I find are more suited to autocannons than this type of loader since it is a 1x2 projectile instead of a ball

the-dump 2023-02-09 15:35:17 the engines have no IR cover so its about as stealthy as any other 4th gen
