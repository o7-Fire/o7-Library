creations-chat 2021-06-02 15:28:15 anyone have an idea how i could add more control over the height of the forks

since i use a piston it only goes to the max height or the lowest height, and cant have it in the middle

i need something compact, and suspension with rope wont fit in there

i'll just try it anyways and see how i like it (nvm)
creations-chat 2021-06-02 15:42:01 not possible, not nearly enough space

is this back any better?
creations-chat 2021-06-14 22:48:12 i dont see how i can really fix the exposed motorlock on the back
creations-chat 2021-06-14 23:02:37 i may or may not have fixed the problem
creations-chat 2021-06-14 23:05:03 how does this look

also i wanted to mention that im not really going for a realistic look, and more of a "cartoony" or "arcade" like tank

<:hahaa:773727260539617280>
creations-chat 2021-06-15 01:57:51 thats just because there are so many expert builders out there that the standard has been set extremely high

and poor amateur builders wont even reach like 20 upvotes unless it has a stupid amount of camera or motor lock

(which most dont know how to do)
creations-chat 2021-06-15 01:59:53 for amateur builders reading this right now

it doesnt really have to be detailed to be good, your build could be as simplistic as possible and it could look good

i suggest you try and make an outline of the nose before you start on building the rest of the nose
