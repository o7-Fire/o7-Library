plane-crazy 2020-04-21 20:41:58 Any mobile players?
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 03:53:38 I hate it
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 03:53:21 Can I turn that crap off?
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 03:53:14 Bruh I play on mobile and every time I launch I get sent to an angle camera view
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 13:29:05 It would be a lot better if you could save the buttons instead of having to reset them everytime I play the game (mobile problems)
plane-crazy 2020-04-05 22:32:45 I’m confused
plane-crazy 2020-04-05 22:25:00 ?
plane-crazy 2020-04-05 22:23:39 I play plan crazy on mobile and flying is easy once you get the hang of it
