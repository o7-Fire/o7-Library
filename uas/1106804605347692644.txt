help 2023-07-07 13:05:34 they got rid of the game's report system years and years ago
help 2023-07-07 13:06:01 ðŸ’€
help 2023-07-07 13:06:16 people can run around now with their funny carts as much as they want now
help 2023-07-07 13:06:26 you could do so too if you wanted to
help 2023-07-15 09:38:45 wing for it is acceptable but you gotta fix the tail
help 2023-07-15 09:39:51 and the elevator
help 2023-07-15 09:41:22 i have a pretty bad MiG-21 with garbage proportions
help 2023-07-15 09:41:24 but like
help 2023-07-15 09:41:27 position the uh
help 2023-07-15 09:41:32 it feels wrong tbh
help 2023-07-15 09:41:41 move it back one block
help 2023-07-15 09:41:46 elevator
help 2023-07-15 09:41:48 more backwards
help 2023-07-15 09:42:19 yes this is a post-bis variant
help 2023-07-15 09:42:24 yeah

help 2023-07-15 09:42:29 as you can see
help 2023-07-15 09:42:34 the rudder and the elevators
help 2023-07-15 09:42:41 "overhang" the uh
help 2023-07-15 09:42:49 exhaust
help 2023-07-15 09:42:58 that's the main issue of your plane
help 2023-07-15 09:43:05 the tail is positioned too far foward
help 2023-07-15 09:43:09 *forward
help 2023-07-15 10:18:19 thats better
help 2023-07-15 10:18:23 OMD
help 2023-07-15 10:18:26 THE TAIL IS EVEN WORSE
help 2023-07-15 10:18:31 MY EYES
help 2023-07-15 10:19:04 didn't you fix it
help 2023-07-15 10:19:09 the tail isnt like that irl
help 2023-07-15 10:23:00 yep
help 2023-07-15 10:23:24 wdym mean
help 2023-07-15 10:23:40 looks perfectly fine to me
help 2023-07-15 10:24:00 can't see anything
help 2023-07-15 10:24:03 all i can see is that it doesnt move
help 2023-07-15 10:24:19 which shouldn't be happening unless you accidently welded it somkewhere
help 2023-07-15 10:24:25 move it one more block back
help 2023-07-15 10:25:03 from where it currently is
help 2023-07-15 10:25:13 merges?
help 2023-07-15 10:25:14 wdym merges
help 2023-07-15 10:25:21 like do they overlap
help 2023-07-15 10:25:27 and the exhaust jams the mechanism to move the elevators?
help 2023-07-15 10:25:58 all i can say is
help 2023-07-15 10:26:06 move it backwards by one block
help 2023-07-15 10:26:16 and set it up like this again
help 2023-07-15 10:26:24 you redesigned the elevator slightly there
help 2023-07-15 10:26:40 try and keep the same shape
help 2023-07-15 10:26:45 rn we want it to be working
help 2023-07-15 10:27:47 it looks fine as it is rn
help 2023-07-15 10:27:53 the actual elevator
help 2023-07-15 10:27:56 but its placed wrong
help 2023-07-15 10:27:59 don't redesign the elevator for now
help 2023-07-15 10:28:06 place that same elevator design
help 2023-07-15 10:28:09 but like 3-4 blocks backwards
help 2023-07-15 10:28:22 this one here is a different design
help 2023-07-15 10:49:17 yep
help 2023-07-15 10:49:22 the tail is good now
help 2023-07-15 10:49:27 but now move the wings back a bit too
help 2023-07-15 10:49:58 mmm wait
help 2023-07-15 10:50:03 yeah move it back like 0.5 to 1 block
help 2023-07-15 10:50:11 it's looking good tho
help 2023-07-15 10:50:13 like the general profile
help 2023-07-15 10:54:07 yeah
help 2023-07-15 10:54:14 save the current version tho
help 2023-07-15 10:54:17 it looks pretty good but
help 2023-07-15 10:54:23 maybe let's see what happens if we move the wing back a bit
help 2023-07-15 11:43:49 um
help 2023-07-15 11:43:51 ok if you think its good
help 2023-07-15 11:43:53 then keep it as it is
help 2023-07-15 11:44:11 i heavily recommend multiple images and using aircraft blueprints in the future
help 2023-07-15 11:59:16 take photos of it then\
help 2023-07-15 15:21:37 irl it would probs have a green radome since well the red is just the intake cover
help 2023-07-16 00:34:08 well yeah
