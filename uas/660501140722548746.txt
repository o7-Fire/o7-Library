events-chat 2022-05-16 16:48:13 We have shown you a vast amount of examples of the arm moving and lifting
events-chat 2022-05-16 16:56:34 They aren’t flippers yeah, but the amount of things that were to realistic in the bots that competed  were way greater then a different speed on a lifter
events-chat 2022-05-16 17:34:33 Im not ignoring it, yeah he had it over
events-chat 2022-05-16 17:34:50 Just saying that the lifters are actually lifters
events-chat 2022-05-16 18:20:44 The torque has to be high for a lifter
events-chat 2022-05-16 18:21:13 In the haste of events you forget stuff from irl experience, but that is irl not pc
