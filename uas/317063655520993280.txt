bug-reports 2020-01-25 01:27:41 next time rick adds more cylinders, theres gonna be Quarter cylinder 3 2x2x2
bug-reports 2020-01-25 01:28:34 right next to Quarter cylinder 2 1x2x2
bug-reports 2020-01-25 01:28:46 and Quarter cylinder 5x5x1
bug-reports 2020-02-05 06:14:42 Wtf is wrong with Anchor blocks??? They used to be fine and now there are only two options,
Either your  entire creation is frozen... motors and stuff wont move
Or entire creation is a wobbly kracken
bug-reports 2020-02-05 06:15:06 How about just one? Normal anchor block that simply stops moving like it used to.
bug-reports 2020-02-05 06:20:14 I mean its cool that rickje is adding new stuff, but i would perfer it if my space station didnt reach 5 thousand speed when I activate a block that is supposed to stop movement.
bug-reports 2020-02-05 06:26:48 like
bug-reports 2020-02-05 06:26:48 cool, but I still dont see the problem. The old anchor block seemed to simply just stop movement for itself... why does the new anchor block freeze motors and stuff
bug-reports 2020-02-05 06:26:51 if therer is a grid system
bug-reports 2020-02-05 06:26:59 then if one block is stuck in place
bug-reports 2020-02-05 06:27:03 the others should just chill there
bug-reports 2020-02-05 06:27:12 but instead, the motors freeze
bug-reports 2020-02-05 06:27:34 and in physics mode it wobbles as if the anchor block itself is on some sort of joint or whatever
bug-reports 2020-02-05 06:27:49 so I don't see why
bug-reports 2020-02-05 06:28:23 I dont see why this is happening
bug-reports 2020-02-05 06:29:04 it seems like rickje just made the anchor block freeze the entire creation and then made some sort of rotating mode or some shit and just called it a day
bug-reports 2020-02-05 06:29:47 and how am I not supposed to be mad when I spend hours on a space station and it starts trying to hit airplanes out of the sky like a baseball bat
bug-reports 2020-02-05 06:30:34 but if theres like a reason, like roblox messed up the phyics or whatever, if theres an actual reason then thats fine
bug-reports 2020-02-05 06:30:38 but the only answer I seem to get is
bug-reports 2020-02-05 06:30:41 "roblox updates"
bug-reports 2020-02-05 06:35:24 so
bug-reports 2020-02-05 06:35:27 let me get this straight
bug-reports 2020-02-05 06:35:38 roblox no longer allows the game
bug-reports 2020-02-05 06:35:44 to freeze a single block in place
bug-reports 2020-02-05 06:35:45 instead
bug-reports 2020-02-05 06:35:51 it has to freeze the entire fucking creation
bug-reports 2020-02-05 06:35:54 including the rotating parts
bug-reports 2020-02-05 06:36:06 and stop the disconectors from dethatching
bug-reports 2020-02-05 06:37:19 I'm sorry. I still dont fucking get it.
bug-reports 2020-02-05 06:37:22 roblox
bug-reports 2020-02-05 06:37:27 is this platform
bug-reports 2020-02-05 06:37:30 for people to make games
bug-reports 2020-02-05 06:37:37 AND YOU CANT FUCKING FREEZE A SINGLE FUCKING BLOCK IN PLACE
bug-reports 2020-02-05 06:37:58 THATS THE JOB OF THE DEVELOPERS
bug-reports 2020-02-05 06:38:20 it legit seems like rickje just came up with some wack solution, and then never touched the anchor blocks again
bug-reports 2020-02-05 06:39:24 BITCH I dont know WHACK about coding but I WAS ABLE TO FREEZE SHIT IN PLACE IN SOME SHITTY GAME CREATOR, AND ROBLOX CANT EVEN DO THAT?
bug-reports 2020-02-05 06:39:51 dude

bug-reports 2020-02-05 06:39:59 in roblox
bug-reports 2020-02-05 06:40:04 and rickje cant freeze a fucking block
bug-reports 2020-02-05 06:40:06 thats bullshit.
bug-reports 2020-02-05 06:40:09 okay?
bug-reports 2020-02-05 06:40:44 what do motors have to do with this
bug-reports 2020-02-05 06:41:04 listen to my thinking. there is a grid system which means blocks are pretty much superglued to each other
bug-reports 2020-02-05 06:41:15 so if one little part
bug-reports 2020-02-05 06:41:21 of the creation cant move
bug-reports 2020-02-05 06:41:32 then the rest shouldnt be able to move
bug-reports 2020-02-05 06:41:35 but instead im seeing
bug-reports 2020-02-05 06:41:39 is like
bug-reports 2020-02-05 06:41:41 a radius
bug-reports 2020-02-05 06:41:43 no no no
bug-reports 2020-02-05 06:41:45 a motor
bug-reports 2020-02-05 06:41:47 is not connected
bug-reports 2020-02-05 06:41:56 listen
bug-reports 2020-02-05 06:42:00 idk wtf ur talking about
bug-reports 2020-02-05 06:42:29 the anchor block should freeze itself, and the rest of the blocks stay put. the motor shouldnt me affected because its a different part
bug-reports 2020-02-05 06:42:32 its not connected to the grid
bug-reports 2020-02-05 06:42:40 so it should spin
bug-reports 2020-02-05 06:42:42 yes
bug-reports 2020-02-05 06:43:04 AND DISCONECTORS DONT WORK EITHER
bug-reports 2020-02-05 06:43:04 BUT IT FUCKING DONT
bug-reports 2020-02-05 06:43:05 it dont
bug-reports 2020-02-05 06:43:30 ok ok
bug-reports 2020-02-05 06:43:33 let me give you an example
bug-reports 2020-02-05 06:43:43 lets say you have a plank of wood with a hinge on it
bug-reports 2020-02-05 06:43:48 and you nail that plank of wood in place
bug-reports 2020-02-05 06:43:54 that seemed to be how the old anchor worked
bug-reports 2020-02-05 06:43:56 the new one
bug-reports 2020-02-05 06:44:09 seems to cover the entire fucking plank of wood including the hinge
bug-reports 2020-02-05 06:44:10 in super glue
bug-reports 2020-02-05 06:44:26 bruh
bug-reports 2020-02-05 06:44:31 the nail
bug-reports 2020-02-05 06:44:33 is the anchor
bug-reports 2020-02-05 06:44:37 the wood

creations-chat 2020-08-26 00:12:57 ah
bug-reports 2020-08-26 03:36:43 it seems that I cant use cutters on other people when I have an anchor block on my creation?
bug-reports 2020-08-26 16:27:53 So are cutter blocks ever gonna be fixed? I legit showed rickje that my cutter blocks glitched when they first came out and they still don't work.
bug-reports 2020-08-26 16:29:02 it looks like hes not fixing them because "its working for him"
bug-reports 2020-08-26 16:36:42 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_x6ARkEY9w
bug-reports 2020-08-26 16:36:47 anchor blocks break cutters. fix it.
bug-reports 2020-08-26 16:37:23 When I remove the anchor block, the cutters work fine
bug-reports 2020-08-26 16:38:01 I turned off self protection.
bug-reports 2020-08-26 16:38:21 if you actually watched the video, you would see that I was able to cut my own build without the anchor block
bug-reports 2020-08-26 16:41:03 now we just sit back, and watch rickje fucking ignore it
bug-reports 2020-08-26 16:41:25 I even posted evidence that rickje ignores this issue

bug-reports 2022-05-15 04:37:56 Me and my friends have been experiencing a soft lock bug.
Sometimes when I bring a vehicle to the water, My chat messages stop sending, and the despawn arrow stops working. I know it’s not lag or ping because everybody else in the game is talking and moving around at normal speed and the ping doesn’t change on the performance stats. Also when I reset I stay dead for like 30 seconds and get kicked. Idfk
bug-reports 2022-05-15 05:36:03 How did you narrow down the cause to a block that’s used it like literally every plane crazy build ever
creations-chat 2022-05-21 00:59:05 Friends bitching to me about the red and orange clashing. First image has brighter red and brighter orange and the 2nd are more desaturated. Which is better
creations-chat 2022-05-21 01:02:07 barely different bruh 
Edit: 👍
PS: why tf do they need slowchat for creations? bro omg everybodys so interested rn spam spam spam

bug-reports 2022-09-22 03:22:30 theres a bug in rickjes brain rn if he added this on purpose. rickje has so many other things to do rn like uhh idk maybe not ignoring <#507673335816126509> or working on PC2. if he did this to signs intentionally im gonna implode 👍
bug-reports 2022-09-22 03:25:37 it just occured to me that all those tank builders who spam signs all over their builds for "detail" are getting dunked on. good feature
