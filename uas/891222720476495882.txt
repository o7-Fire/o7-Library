creations-chat 2023-01-21 16:21:54 how tf u do that
creations-chat 2023-01-21 16:24:46 I upvoted it because itâ€™s nice to see a fun invention every now and then. every time I play the game I am insanely bored, something like that should be cherished even if itâ€™s simple
creations-chat 2023-01-21 16:28:36 I like it, donâ€™t get so mad over a fun build man <:PewPew:532303441293344778>
creations-chat 2023-01-21 16:31:05 even if thatâ€™s true they must have learnt from the best
creations-chat 2023-01-21 16:33:21 I stand by my words then, youâ€™ve just proven my point
creations-chat 2023-01-21 16:35:54 yeah? I still like it, besides if you compare it to that f16 you will see why people downvoted it
creations-chat 2023-01-21 16:38:38 ironic how youâ€™re calling it ass
creations-chat 2023-01-21 16:41:14 yeah I do appear to be serious about posting that shit f22 ðŸ’€ really had to scroll up like 1.5k messages for a joke
creations-chat 2023-01-21 16:43:59 heâ€™s asking about that shit f16
creations-chat 2023-01-21 16:46:03 Iâ€™m just trying to say that I liked the washing machine thing because they compared it to a dog f16 that could be improved by a mile. thatâ€™s the main reason why people downvoted
creations-chat 2023-01-21 16:49:18 why getting so defensive over a starter f22? at least this looks better, if you wanna say itâ€™s trash then go ahead and tell me what can be improved
creations-chat 2023-01-21 16:51:35 whatâ€™s motorlock?
creations-chat 2023-01-21 16:53:46 sorry my motorlock tower doesnâ€™t have decals or angle lock, it looks hideou oh no!!!!!
creations-chat 2023-01-21 16:56:23 yeah because I need to make my build more complicated and heavy instead of just doing that. instead of actual flaws youâ€™re pointing about ugly motorlock that isnâ€™t even exposed
creations-chat 2023-01-21 16:59:35 I didnâ€™t find anythin
creations-chat 2023-01-21 17:01:46 I did find you have quite the record for spreading needless drama
creations-chat 2023-01-21 17:05:40 it was just showing our convo in <#504436696021204992>. when was this even about your only creation anyways? show me your fighter jets
creations-chat 2023-01-21 17:07:50 so why do you have such a bad opinion on them if you donâ€™t make them
creations-chat 2023-01-21 17:10:01 so give me actual feedback instead of just calling it bad for no reason other than butthurt
creations-chat 2023-01-21 17:12:48 alright any actual flaws you wanna add to that? like angle lock
creations-chat 2023-01-21 17:17:25 youâ€™re getting to the stage in your childhood where you overuse emojis, thatâ€™s nice
creations-chat 2023-01-21 17:20:17 I was just saying that I liked something, donâ€™t need to get so toxic abt a stupid jet anyway
creations-chat 2023-01-21 17:22:19 nice to see someone actually has a point
creations-chat 2023-01-21 17:25:47 then why donâ€™t you just stop replying? I was getting off an hour and a half ago but our own pettiness just took that time out of our lives for a stupid worthless reason
creations-chat 2023-01-21 17:27:58 people who claim to be 16 do behave in such a manner
creations-chat 2023-01-21 17:31:11 calmest reaction after being told you wasted an hour and a half
creations-chat 2023-01-21 17:33:52 I would if I didnâ€™t have COVID but I appreciate your enthusiasm
creations-chat 2023-01-21 17:44:08 dude itâ€™s literally been 10 minutes get over it
creations-chat 2023-01-21 17:49:16 depends if you wanna keep arguing because I donâ€™t really care if u wanna keep being toxic like this. also you use the hand emoji a lot, itâ€™s like youâ€™re sending a signal that you use it way too often

help 2023-02-10 13:14:19 zoomer can u send a video or something
help 2023-02-10 13:14:40 itâ€™s probably the weight distribution
help 2023-02-10 13:16:02 those physics would make sense too considering that if you apply power the nose goes up, that means pushing down power brings you down. a solution to combat gravity itself is to just cancel out that distribution using ballast blocks and/or helium blocks, thus allowing for a much smoother flight <@764128494874918982>
