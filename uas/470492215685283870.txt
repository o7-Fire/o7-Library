the-dump 2021-02-18 01:51:15 the roblox chat filter legit lets you say the german mans name
the-dump 2021-02-18 01:51:18 im not kidding
the-dump 2021-02-18 01:51:22 ive done it multiple times
bug-reports 2021-02-28 05:30:09 rip all of my 130 days are gone now
bug-reports 2021-02-28 05:30:28 rick broke time played
bug-reports 2021-02-28 05:30:35 it doesnt load my time played anymore
bug-reports 2021-02-28 05:30:55 so now my accumulated 130 days are gone
bug-reports 2021-04-20 22:33:44 rick broke motor 2's again
bug-reports 2021-04-20 22:33:51 motor 2's are super weak on alot of my builds now
bug-reports 2021-04-20 22:34:06 a tank i had that was using motor 2's for its suspension cant drive very good anymore
bug-reports 2021-04-20 22:34:24 the motor 2's just collapse under the weight of it compared to staying up like it did before
bug-reports 2021-04-20 22:41:25 of course it was roblox
bug-reports 2021-04-20 22:41:36 constraints are pretty crap
bug-reports 2021-04-20 22:44:52 yeah it seems roblox added a servo responsiveness option that kinda broke servo's
bug-reports 2021-04-20 22:44:57 hopefully they will fix that soon
bug-reports 2021-06-03 21:07:33 the not colliding with terrain physics bug started happening to me too about 10 minutes ago
bug-reports 2021-06-03 21:07:43 i reinstalled roblox twice thinking i messed something up with my roblox but nope
bug-reports 2021-06-03 21:07:46 it kept happening
bug-reports 2021-06-03 21:14:59 it seems that the not colliding with terrain bug only happens on the normal version of roblox
bug-reports 2021-06-03 21:15:06 i tested on the app version and it doesnt happen
bug-reports 2021-06-03 21:21:06 seems like it
bug-reports 2021-06-21 15:48:29 the being unable to pick up event items bug has existed ever since the first winter event
bug-reports 2021-06-21 15:48:35 i remember running into it
bug-reports 2021-06-21 15:48:58 i dont think it did
bug-reports 2021-06-21 15:49:09 it just magically started working but now the bug is back
bug-reports 2021-07-07 02:17:04 is it a pvp server that the sign is gone in
bug-reports 2021-07-07 02:22:51 i was surprised when i figured out a few structures are destructible in pvp

the-dump 2021-08-22 01:00:33 ok
the-dump 2021-08-22 05:03:37 do it
the-dump 2021-08-22 05:03:59 pog
the-dump 2021-08-22 05:04:01 he did it
bug-reports 2021-08-22 23:58:09 it happens cause of the server freezing when 2 players join
bug-reports 2021-08-23 03:34:53 your physics went server side, judging by how your plane vanished for a second
bug-reports 2021-08-23 03:55:24 i dont even really know what causes it, it happens in my game (not allowed to mention) when one end of a motor falls into the void
bug-reports 2021-08-23 03:55:36 it does seem to be a roblox issue though
