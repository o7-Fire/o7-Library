creations-chat 2021-10-09 16:11:11 its a tank what else would it be covered in
creations-chat 2021-10-09 16:13:23 I was challenged in finding an accurate material for it
creations-chat 2021-10-09 16:23:50 needs a bit of detail but its pretty cool
creations-chat 2021-10-09 16:35:57 landing gear
creations-chat 2021-10-09 16:41:12 i looked at a refrence photo and theres not much to the plane
creations-chat 2021-10-09 16:43:30 what about my f 16 (needs a ton of help)
creations-chat 2021-10-09 16:45:48 the cockpit and intake are motorlocked already and the plane flys amazing i think
creations-chat 2021-10-09 16:50:04 np and where do you think could use some more smoothing
creations-chat 2021-10-09 16:52:05 noted thx

creations-chat 2021-10-10 17:58:15 bruh thats the point of a concept and why are you being so toxic about it, I came here for advice not a mental breakdown thanks alot
creations-chat 2021-10-10 18:01:02 heres an example
creations-chat 2021-10-10 18:04:10 its not a refrence image and there was never a refrence image thats probbly why it looks so unrealistic to you
creations-chat 2021-10-10 18:10:00 Judast you realize im asking for advice tho so give me advice instead of shooting me down. Im new here and i dont want to fight with anyone but you are making it very hard. I built it like a month ago when i was realy unexperienced. (edit) thx for the encouragement but the cuss words are kinda unnecessary.
creations-chat 2021-10-10 18:17:26 Thanks for the advice!!!
creations-chat 2021-10-11 00:38:09 the funny thing is that i have this car irl and yours looks very accurate just add the custom HW rims and you are set

help 2021-10-20 19:17:49 this is for using. With this method you can turn while going forward instead of disengaging one track to turn and coming to a full stop.
help 2021-10-20 19:18:40 if there are wedges that contact it there is nothing you can do (its a glitch)
help 2021-10-20 19:18:56 but put a pic so i can see
help 2021-10-20 19:21:25 okk make sure all the blocks under the turret are 0.9
help 2021-10-20 19:21:47 ummm....
help 2021-10-20 19:22:19 is the whole top of the hull 0.9
help 2021-10-20 19:23:20 oh you did the turret
help 2021-10-20 19:23:30 in that case you dont need to do the hull
help 2021-10-20 19:24:22 angle your camera so you can see throgh the gap between the hull and the turret to see the contact points where it gets stuck
help 2021-10-20 19:25:17 i have the same problem with my kranvagn
help 2021-10-20 19:25:38 the sad part is that theres no fix to it
help 2021-10-20 19:26:01 no its a friction glitch between the wedges and the turret
help 2021-10-20 19:26:35 send me a pic from the side
help 2021-10-20 19:27:04 it would only add a ugly gap
help 2021-10-20 19:27:40 ok then you can add the 0.9 blocks there
help 2021-10-20 19:28:13 ye
help 2021-10-20 19:28:42 or you could make the whole top of the hull 0.9 and the turret regular blocks
help 2021-10-20 19:28:51 thats what i do at least
help 2021-10-20 19:29:00

help 2021-10-22 00:22:18 oh ALL of them are broke
help 2021-10-22 00:22:48 idk what to do in your case then
creations-chat 2021-10-22 00:54:27 because of the max angle
creations-chat 2021-10-22 00:57:38 i have a thought but you didnt ask me to share it (its cool)
creations-chat 2021-10-22 13:41:22 wow
creations-chat 2021-10-24 20:10:44 to me the angle of the horisontal stabilizers is  to far down but other than that its fine

help 2021-10-25 15:45:05 i think it needs some work
help 2021-10-25 17:57:58 i think it can depending on the amount of lag
help 2021-10-25 17:58:11 its happened with my jet that goes 600
help 2021-10-25 17:58:23 the rockets barely go faster then it

help 2021-10-25 19:04:45 the nose spesificly
help 2021-10-26 01:19:52 whats wrong with it tho
help 2021-10-26 02:58:29 all you need is extra track wheels in between that follow the shape you want
help 2021-10-26 02:58:54 so that when you tension the treds they go to the desired shape
help 2021-10-26 02:59:55 but what the other people were saying is right it is WAY to long
creations-chat 2021-10-26 12:35:35 if possible you could try to round the top and bottom of the vertical stabilizers but other than that i think its accurate
help 2021-10-26 14:11:58 does anyone know the angle of the f 16 elevators
help 2021-10-26 14:31:09 no on the f 16 the elevators point slightly down
help 2021-10-26 14:31:21 im wondering what angle that is
help 2021-10-26 14:31:38 its kinda like the f4 phantoms
help 2021-10-26 14:31:51 yes
help 2021-10-26 14:32:17 see how it points down and away from the fuselage

creations-chat 2021-10-29 00:02:41 looksgood but the front grates are too high one ladder is good
creations-chat 2021-10-29 00:07:00 cheese grater wings, exposed motors, inaccurate nose, gunfire coming out of nose, and probably some other things that people would get off about (you need to make use of motor lock for the tail and wings
creations-chat 2021-10-29 00:09:37 i do too and personaly i perfer them but people blast them anyway
creations-chat 2021-10-29 00:12:45 i didnt see that one
creations-chat 2021-10-29 00:14:48 i forgot to add that the gun ports next to the main gun are to close to the middle. you might want to move them out for accuracy points
creations-chat 2021-10-29 00:19:01 just move them to the outer edge of the tank one block out
creations-chat 2021-10-29 00:22:07 is it motor locked

creations-chat 2021-10-29 00:28:25 lol
creations-chat 2021-10-29 00:38:58 why dont you suggest it. My guess tho is that it would cause a ton of lag because of the way plane crazy is coded

creations-chat 2021-11-02 18:23:43 np i can use some work up at the front but i think it has potential so i upvoted. The wheels need to be widened from the middle of the car and the back windshield can slope more
creations-chat 2021-11-02 18:26:29 yes the blast shields and lines haven't been painted yet.
creations-chat 2021-11-02 18:30:59 just one block and add a taper to the front to see how that looks.

creations-chat 2022-03-01 23:24:30 <@!393527373729103888> your f 16 is great all except the wings. you need to custom angle them. Ik its a pain but its realy worth it. Also the canopy looks a tad large and un angled. Great job overall tho
creations-chat 2022-03-01 23:27:04 ye thats the onlyy frustrating downside but i think the looks outweigh it
creations-chat 2022-03-01 23:30:16 to fix the canopy all you need to do is angle it down with the bottom of the nose. But that might be hard considdering what your motorlocking looks like. Send me a pic of the nose despawned tho
creations-chat 2022-03-01 23:33:43 k so your canopy is more like a half of an oval whearas the f 16 canopy has an airfoil shape if you know what i mean. Its like a water drop on its side. ill send a pic of what i mean in a sec
creations-chat 2022-03-01 23:43:54 yours has a flat bottom where the botom of the f16 canopy has a slight up angle. Also yours is like a semi circle and the f 16 has a shape like that of an air foil (bad art skls lol)

creations-chat 2022-04-05 13:50:36 The canopy should move up and back by a half block each and the top of the nose should be angle locked your canopy is like between the intakes but it should be over them
creations-chat 2022-04-05 13:54:36 the edge of the intakes should cross the exact middle of the canopy and the canopy should more or less line up with the top edge of the intake (i think thats the right variant

creations-chat 2022-04-09 15:10:41 <@800572865443397662> i only downvoted it bc it didnr look good. You should fix the colors and the proportions and make the barrels have a dark front (do that with ann emoji) also the shades are way too big. For the grill just use trails. The tires also could use some detailing with half blocks or emojis. The gun section is very nice. The car under it just isnt.

creations-chat 2022-05-05 12:01:55 he is right but out of line
creations-chat 2022-05-05 17:40:14 those elevators are not the best.

creations-chat 2022-05-07 21:58:03 <@768450022156927014> you will be penalized for the modded tut aspect so i suggest you delete asap
creations-chat 2022-05-07 23:14:43 dont argue (its pointless) people just do it for entertainment, and this channel is very rarely used for its intended purpose, (unless im giving feedback)
creations-chat 2022-05-07 23:21:20 its honestly not bad considdering the minimal motor lock and realistic (ish) functionality, yes the color is a bit off but theres honestly not much to be done better unless you fully motorlock it.

creations-chat 2022-05-09 01:00:42 the point he and alot of others are trrying to make is that theres no "feedback" going on in this channel, its just a bunch of people talking crap abt peoples builds
creations-chat 2022-05-10 00:41:18 lock pontoons for the nose
creations-chat 2022-05-10 01:05:04 plz pin this
creations-chat 2022-05-11 15:08:11 It is interesting. The props are WAY too small tho and its blocky and needs better colors. But its pretty cool fot your first build.👍
creations-chat 2022-05-11 15:11:09 I'm one of the only mods that even bothers checking this channel because of the dumpster-fire that it is, don't make me get unfunny with you bozos. No insulting, No negativity towards others, literally just give proper feedback to people's builds as that is the purpose of this channel

Any unfunny pointless comments or arguing and stuff toward others will not be tolerated, I'm gonna try to change this channel for the better 
(Just like how I re-did the contests chat to a better organization FineTroll ) (from  rbk himself)

creations-chat 2022-05-29 02:42:05 Look man im on your side here honestly(ask any competant person). This server is not too welcoming to new players so it is best to get a feel for the game and use the <#478584971670454284> chanel for constructive feedback and such. Then when expert ranked people say that your build is good(if they are willing to help) then post it in creations. Even then you will get hate but its best to just ignore it

creations-chat 2022-05-31 17:15:16 honestly its hardly expected to actualy make a realistic build in terms of aerodynamics and such in this game because yoiu cant just put your creations in a wind tunnel and test them. so who are you to say its terrible if it was made at the mercy of what the builder wanted. yes it bight not be in your style but you just have to accept that. I know for certain that its not in my style but im not gonna go out of my way to call it terrible.

creations-chat 2022-08-23 01:52:19 agreed
creations-chat 2022-08-23 01:54:25 by tuning i simply meant to cut the cone all together and just expose the turbine (promise thats the last thing im gonna say)

creations-chat 2022-09-03 19:50:11 he means to make it move in and out of the plane

bot-central 2022-09-03 20:34:13 probably
bot-central 2022-09-03 20:34:20 you just need a rank
bot-central 2022-09-03 20:37:09 that gives you a link for free vip servers for plane crazy
bot-central 2022-09-03 20:37:22 but only if you have a rank
bot-central 2022-09-03 20:37:43 and to get a rank you have to get to lvl 3
bot-central 2022-09-03 20:37:46 No
bot-central 2022-09-03 20:37:52 you can get banned for that
creations-chat 2022-09-03 23:48:38 nose is realy fat, idk how you would fix (maybe angled half blocks other than that the plane looks like a block short  the rest is quite good
creations-chat 2022-09-03 23:50:54 unless you made the tutorial you are breaking the rules
creations-chat 2022-09-04 00:07:22 wings are short by 4 blocks <@521504905693888521> just another 1x4 delta

creations-chat 2022-09-06 13:27:00 you cant post it in <#384025409945337856>  bc it isnt a plane crazy build
creations-chat 2022-09-06 20:22:47 <@417337478421282816> Why<:Mhm:551152556324159488>
creations-chat 2022-09-06 20:25:40 can you vote on the build itself plz, its real petty to downvote for the photo quality imo
creations-chat 2022-09-06 20:28:52 thats just you in this case, you are the only downvoter currently, and id have you know that photo quality isnt in the same category as your actual build looking bad (witch mine dosent) but anyway its pointless going back and forth about one downvote
creations-chat 2022-09-06 20:33:01 i didnt insult your build (or at least i didnt mean too) i have no beef with you, no need to be mad i was refering to builds in general
creations-chat 2022-09-06 20:36:34 coming soon, its just a teaser rn
creations-chat 2022-09-06 20:38:56 you will see it when i repost
creations-chat 2022-09-06 23:28:22 wing tip transitions look odd, they should taper to just a wing pannel thick but idk how you would do that properly.
creations-chat 2022-09-07 15:19:25 very short
creations-chat 2022-09-07 15:35:23 no i mean the nose itself is realy short overall
creations-chat 2022-09-09 02:49:44 but with way more functionality the canopy opens and the nozzels open and close
creations-chat 2022-09-09 16:00:59 <@691825046590718111> the wings have realy bad proportions and the nose is short, i think the rest is fine but i cant tell from the angles

creations-chat 2022-09-21 13:35:41 bro i remember your jet, but for some reason it looks alot goofier now (not bc of shaders)
creations-chat 2022-09-21 13:38:10 ok listen here, it was a false warn (i suggested a mod be online) and so many other people get off the hook for stuff like that

creations-chat 2022-09-22 21:23:28 that gif makes no sense, if the person is pretending to be somethings else you are automaticly proving that the person was infact a person and therefor canot be refuted basic human rights (eas)

creations-chat 2022-09-22 21:47:45 it dosent have to  be far away you just have to confiugure the blast pressure and blast radius i can senmd you the settings later when roblox comes back up
creations-chat 2022-09-22 21:50:14 some of them are experienced builders, others are just trol whit names
creations-chat 2022-09-22 21:54:21 btw gam3 I tried to fix the spine but it brought up a bunch of complications with exposed lock that I couldn't fix and i would have put a whole ton of additional piston lock. in the end i decided it wasnt worth it but i will try again in pc 2
creations-chat 2022-09-22 21:56:49 personaly i dont see how my f 16 could look bland but ok
creations-chat 2022-09-22 22:00:06 complecated <:FineTroll:626841259746656289> id have to creat another angle lock section <@448677698773057547> yeah i can see that

creations-chat 2022-09-22 22:37:24 thats just the shaders actualy

creations-chat 2022-11-05 23:27:57 <:clueless:942802644043464734>
creations-chat 2022-11-05 23:29:47 doesent the other game in question have its own discord server
creations-chat 2022-11-05 23:30:14 if you want to post about it go there
creations-chat 2022-11-05 23:30:18 if it exists
creations-chat 2022-11-05 23:30:53 HA it does
creations-chat 2022-11-05 23:32:02 and posting about it falls in the category of advertising
creations-chat 2022-11-05 23:32:11 same
creations-chat 2022-11-05 23:45:36 omg the idea was ricks in the first place so when he announced that pc 2 was coming out the dev of midchanica made his game
creations-chat 2022-11-05 23:45:40 its a spite thing
creations-chat 2022-11-05 23:46:55 coming soon
creations-chat 2022-11-05 23:47:02 when: we dont know
creations-chat 2022-11-05 23:49:52 i dont know if it was developed before pc 2 was announced so you do have that argument
creations-chat 2022-11-05 23:50:29 but still, if you want to post about a game in the same genera go to its dedicated discord server
creations-chat 2022-11-05 23:50:33 why post it here
creations-chat 2022-11-05 23:51:36 because its basicly the only roblox building game that can compare
creations-chat 2022-11-05 23:51:58 why dont you shut up and comply with what obc and rick have said
creations-chat 2022-11-05 23:52:44 and if you dont like that then just go crying to the midchanica server

creations-chat 2023-04-13 20:35:27 no
creations-chat 2023-04-13 21:03:58 hi
creations-chat 2023-04-14 12:47:28 its not an insult. the build plain looks bad. if it had a better execution then maybe it would be received better. but calling it islamophobia is irrational. they just dont like the look of the build
creations-chat 2023-04-14 13:09:26 the general conduct of whitenames is 1. make a bad beginner build (and think its good) 2. post it and  3. get mad out of their balls when their build gets hate. the whitenames that actually enter here with good builds arent treated nearly as harshly. So its not realy racism or discrimination its just their regular lack of a coping mechanism
creations-chat 2023-04-14 13:09:53 whitenames are like the Karens of pcc imo
creations-chat 2023-04-14 13:14:18 just a verbal warning since it was only a jab and not actual hate
creations-chat 2023-04-14 13:15:07 hof is only dead because the people in vip lounge dont let anything in

creations-chat 2023-06-29 18:43:58 yea
creations-chat 2023-06-29 18:45:29 but pls in future keep things pc related. Rick dosent like ppl talking about other roblox games in the same genera. its not my decision.
creations-chat 2023-06-29 23:49:13 <:clueless:942802644043464734>
creations-chat 2023-06-29 23:50:03 yes
creations-chat 2023-06-29 23:50:06 thats the point
creations-chat 2023-06-29 23:50:10 <:clueless:942802644043464734>
creations-chat 2023-06-29 23:51:52 oh god here we go again
creations-chat 2023-06-29 23:59:33 from my perspective you took the argument out of context. yes we downvote builds because they are simple, but only because they are insanely simple compared to the stuff other people do in the game. Also the people in vip lounge literally let nothing into hof anymore.
creations-chat 2023-06-29 23:59:59 ya this too
creations-chat 2023-06-30 00:01:50 it was made in 2014 bro
creations-chat 2023-06-30 00:02:02 by one person
creations-chat 2023-06-30 00:02:10 as a fun project
creations-chat 2023-06-30 00:02:17 not a spesificly curated game
creations-chat 2023-06-30 00:02:39 then one other person started developing on the same view
creations-chat 2023-06-30 00:02:59 people play it bc the simplicity is fun
creations-chat 2023-06-30 00:03:35 yes thats why we find the game fun....
creations-chat 2023-06-30 00:04:11 the games arent compareable in any way
creations-chat 2023-06-30 00:04:42 its like comparing blender to ms paint
creations-chat 2023-06-30 00:06:34 half the people here dont know what logic is or how to use it. i dont even know how to <:clueless:942802644043464734>
creations-chat 2023-06-30 00:06:45 blender better obv
creations-chat 2023-06-30 00:07:50 like i said the game was made for fun in 2014. ofc it dosent have all that stuff
creations-chat 2023-06-30 00:08:14 you are completely over complicating the argument
creations-chat 2023-06-30 00:09:11 yes the other game is objectively better. but subjectively speaking pc is easier to enjoy
creations-chat 2023-06-30 00:09:47 and those who have maxed out the skills available in pc tend to move to other games anyway
creations-chat 2023-06-30 00:09:51 thats what ive done
creations-chat 2023-06-30 00:10:33 exactly
creations-chat 2023-06-30 00:11:55 lol

creations-chat 2023-06-30 00:12:20 and thats not what i was arguing
