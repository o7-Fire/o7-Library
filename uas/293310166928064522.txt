bug-reports 2023-07-07 15:02:23 there was also a bug that made my center of mass indicator disappear making my move tool not work
bug-reports 2023-07-07 15:19:52 do you try to unanchor right after you spawn?
bug-reports 2023-07-07 15:24:01 cuz depending on the size of your build and your pc's specs u might need to wait a couple of seconds before updates get registered
bug-reports 2023-07-07 15:32:10 does it have a motor2?
bug-reports 2023-07-07 15:32:49 point to mouse ones?
bug-reports 2023-07-07 15:38:15 does ur ship disconnect from something?
bug-reports 2023-07-07 15:38:44 oh
bug-reports 2023-07-07 15:38:51 weird
bug-reports 2023-07-07 15:39:41 the only time that happens to me sometimes is when my build gets separated from my point to mouse motor2
bug-reports 2023-07-07 15:40:17 happened to me earlier too
bug-reports 2023-07-07 15:40:41 then when i re select the move tool the thing just vanished
bug-reports 2023-07-07 15:40:46 like poof
bug-reports 2023-07-07 15:40:47 gone
bug-reports 2023-07-07 15:41:03 it came back after some spamming
bug-reports 2023-07-07 15:41:13 prob not
bug-reports 2023-07-07 15:50:18 thats exactly what was happening to me earlier
bug-reports 2023-07-07 15:53:32 it either does that, go to the center of the map, or just vanish
bug-reports 2023-07-08 08:56:35 figured out a way to replicate the error 69 bug
bug-reports 2023-07-08 08:57:06 if u place something ontop of the invisible hitbox of a magnet then you are guaranteed to get the error(atleast from my testing)
bug-reports 2023-07-08 08:57:17 tested it 4 times just to be sure
