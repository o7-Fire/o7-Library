creations-chat 2021-07-30 01:02:33 For the BML-U, I did some normal angle locks, but I also had to use a piston lock to  match the angle or height of the wedges.

creations-chat 2021-08-03 18:44:55 Seeing the F-16XL and the F/A-18 really shows I gotta up my game now
creations-chat 2021-08-04 15:14:49 <@!658589168770875412> For most Age-1’s I’ve see, that one seems nice compared to others. But I think what you can do to bring out some of the detail is to make the colors like the red and blue more subtle and a bit darker. Another thing you can try to do is to have 2-3 different shades of white like you would find on Real Grade (RG) Gunpla models

creations-chat 2021-10-13 21:58:26 I don’t think any dramatic changes occurred in PvP, apart from a couple more fighters out and about lately

creations-chat 2021-10-18 21:24:30 <@!739369649971527720> For a PvP built Phantom, you probably focused more on the handling than the overall exterior. But even if it’s a PvP aircraft, I’ll still give the upvote for making it a decently good looking Phantom for PvP. Plus, you know how to fly the thing mainly because I encountered you twice in public PvP and you shot my Jaguar while I was doing my angle locks

creations-chat 2021-11-05 03:35:17 Actually, if you’re really going for a good quality Rafale in that scale, you’d actually want to hide the locks as much as possible. You can pull off showing barely any locks on a scale like that. But there are acceptions of course being so small and all. Here’s my Gripen for instance, same scale but not a lot of exposed locks. *Some* exposed locks would lower the quality, ***barely*** is what you want to gun for. But none is best for obvious reasons.

(I should probably learn how not to type a whole essay for such a simple explanation)

The only things I’d be aware of is that because you made the Gripen E, there are small intakes/vents located behind the canopy and where the vertical stabilizer is. Other than that, solid 10/10 Gripen from me, I wouldn’t worry about it too much, just small things

creations-chat 2022-01-06 05:50:55 Nothing wrong with some *extra* variation of colors
There’s a thing called weathering, different parts can have different shades depending on the specific part and it’s purpose
creations-chat 2022-01-06 05:56:44 Depending on the scenario, you can get yourself a brand spanking fresh F-4EJ with a clean livery, or a worn down, faded paint, but also rugged F-4EJ that’s seen some better days. All about what you’re going through. You’re either going to war, or the showrooms
creations-chat 2022-01-06 06:01:13 It looks normal irl but in PC… “oOoOh iT lAcKs SoMe DeTaIl”
creations-chat 2022-01-06 13:28:23 *Hover Drives, Magnet Drives (nobody uses these), and Conveyor Drives*: **…**
creations-chat 2022-01-06 22:46:14 So about 9 hours or so later, here’s my response to your “Piston Drives”, be an eligible source of thrust:

From what it looks like, the build pushes itself from just about 2-5 blocks from it’s original location, but pistons don’t have a feature that would make it continuously extend outward and back to it’s idle position. Thus meaning if you want to go anywhere, you’d have to consistently press the same key just to travel the amount of distance the pistons can push, and the more pistons, the farther it goes. But that leaves a major issue, it’s manual. Unlike all other thrust types within the game, your Piston Drive has to be constantly monitored unlike other engines such as rocket engines for instance.

For Rocket Engines for instance, you can simply hold W to let it produce thrust if On/Off is enabled, or you can hold W and let go and the rocket can still make a consistent amount of thrust even without manual labor if On/Off is disabled. This can be said with Hover Drives or anything that has variable thrust levels.

Conveyor drives and anything that doesn’t have the variable thrust level feature can produce forward force just by holding a single key.

The only use a Piston has in terms of thrust production is when it’s used to develop Glitch Engines, them being Hover Drives as the most common place. Even though the Piston can be used, it doesn’t serve a real purpose of extending outward to get the hovers going. It instead just glitches the hover thrusters to make them produce an exceeding amount of forward force to push the build forward or any direction. They don’t do anything but glitch a block to produce speed.

Pistons by themselves just cannot make trust all by themselves, thus why you see them paired with other blocks such as Hover Thrusters. If you were to use this so called “Piston Drive” on an aircraft. You’d have to constantly press the same exactly key for about every 5 seconds which can just become a hassle especially for PvP players in mind
haha lol
creations-chat 2022-01-06 22:54:38 Ok I’ll take the warn, I think I went overkill for something so basic. At least I was halted before part 2 of my rant went on about reasoning and lack of knowledge in thrust

creations-chat 2022-01-07 04:42:52 I’d recommend using a basic 2-3 tone livery made up of different shades of gray depending on the aircraft if it’s a wip, I wouldn’t focus on the main livery yet. Especially if you’re posting the progress since certain colors can blend with the background, u can save the current colors tho
creations-chat 2022-01-07 04:48:09 It would be nice if you could remove the gray arrow on your plot as an option
creations-chat 2022-01-07 05:17:27 The canopy height seems fine imo

creations-chat 2022-01-14 07:05:33 Opinions exists
creations-chat 2022-01-15 00:13:12 I have my doubts tbh
creations-chat 2022-01-15 00:15:16 cred F-4EJ Phantom Kai
creations-chat 2022-01-15 00:17:36 From the length of the nose on Sammy’s F-4, it’s more likely the C variant which doesn’t have a gun at the nose. I just realized I was talking about the B and J lol
creations-chat 2022-01-15 00:20:11 But if you’re making the F, just make the nose longer and the canopy shape smoother
creations-chat 2022-01-15 00:22:51 Tip: Hide the locks inside the fuselage so people here won’t harass you over exposed locks.

Also I think you overangled and didn’t angle the nose enough at the same time, If your connection is bad then don’t worry about it for now
creations-chat 2022-01-15 08:43:33 It also has the infamous toilet
help 2022-01-15 19:58:46 Also regulate your thrust to where you’re fast enough to both fly straight without losing altitude and maneuver at the same time
help 2022-01-15 20:06:54 Trapdoors would be best since they have basically no weight and you can change their material
help 2022-01-15 20:09:01 They fill in the same amount of space
help 2022-01-15 20:09:15 It’s their placement that differentiates them
help 2022-01-15 20:11:56 ok fair enough
creations-chat 2022-01-16 01:01:23 It can turn into eggplane
creations-chat 2022-01-17 06:24:29 This is like the only thing that differentiates the two

help 2022-01-21 05:17:02 I can see why they call it a shredder
help 2022-01-21 05:17:20 People classify that as a Shredder Car
help 2022-01-21 05:17:36 It doesn’t have to be a flying bug for it to be a shredder
help 2022-01-21 05:18:25 That’s kinda just giving more reasons of it being a shredder car
help 2022-01-21 05:19:54 They’re probably annoying you because you aren’t using it effectively
help 2022-01-21 05:20:43 If you’re gonna spam, make good use of it at least
help 2022-01-21 05:20:55 And it’s also because it doesn’t look pleasing to the eye
help 2022-01-21 05:21:33 To most people, it’s just another typical PvP player that spams cutters and guns on a ground or ariel vehicle
help 2022-01-21 05:22:43 Oh annoying people using fighter aircraft is ez
help 2022-01-21 05:22:51 But only if you can actually fly
help 2022-01-21 05:23:53 It’s pretty basic to annoy someone that uses an air, ground, or sea target. I may seem toxic (I probably am tbh), but it’s just how things go
help 2022-01-21 05:24:14 You’re in a somewhat decent performing fighter, you tend to make use of it
help 2022-01-21 05:24:35 In public PvP, it’s all about asserting dominance
help 2022-01-21 05:24:51 If you can do that, well you’re the Ace of the server
help 2022-01-21 05:25:23 9/10 public PvP servers are easy to conquer, it’s only when you meet an equal match
help 2022-01-21 05:26:17 Like the requirements for a decent PvP fighter are some maneuverability, 700+ SPS, and a decent amount of weapons. Also it’d be better if your plane has some decent looks
help 2022-01-21 05:28:24 (I’m not sure if it was necessary of me to show one of my PvP aircraft…)
help 2022-01-21 05:28:46 But like, if you want to stick to the ground, then that’s on you
help 2022-01-21 05:29:01 You can pull the same stuff just as a fighter plane
help 2022-01-21 05:29:47 You don’t have to switch to being in the air
help 2022-01-21 05:30:06 That’s just my personal play style, there are people who go with ground vehicles instead
help 2022-01-21 05:35:30 That must mean I did a terrible job

creations-chat 2022-01-23 02:41:46 Sometimes it’s not just about the build, but also the photography that makes the build look good. It’s about getting the good angles on something that could make it even better

creations-chat 2022-01-26 07:26:09 F-35C’s can’t VTOL, they can only do Carrier Catapult launches
They can’t take off and/or land vertically, that’s only for the VTOL aircraft. The F-35C is basically the F-35A’s buffer cousin, it can do Carrier Takeoffs and Carrier Landings, but it isn’t like the F-35B where it can VTOL because it doesn’t have the same systems as that variant
creations-chat 2022-01-26 08:31:16 
creations-chat 2022-01-27 03:59:27 Sorry for this stupid correction but, that’s the B model in that image.
This is the A model top view
creations-chat 2022-01-27 04:01:42 Lol you’re good
creations-chat 2022-01-27 04:14:11 Absolute chonk of a unit
creations-chat 2022-01-27 04:20:22 All about shapes and all about chonk, I forgot I basically gave up on this thing for now
creations-chat 2022-01-27 04:37:57 The pistons locks are so awkward and unreliable, I’ll test out to see if placing the whole intakes would somewhat fix the issue.
Why not have a side view of this, nvm failed. I’ll wait for the cooldown
creations-chat 2022-01-27 04:40:53 sh-boom (that trail/white spec on the fuselage is painted already)
creations-chat 2022-01-27 04:46:17 I tried to simulate the thing circled, it’s probably extra camera and sensors at the nose, but I of course can *attempt* to piston lock it, don’t seem too hard
<@!723940197456281640> Yeah… I’ll cover that at some point
creations-chat 2022-01-27 04:48:40 Righto, I’ll keep that in mind
(And the canopy framing)
creations-chat 2022-01-28 23:08:33 Might wanna change the front landing gear to custom front landing gear due to the scale
You can try replacing the cameras with texts, blocks can go through those easily
It was just a thought
creations-chat 2022-01-29 01:42:46 I don’t think so my friend, there are things that can be improved upon, but I think it’s best for it to have a major overhaul. Also why would you weaponize a demonstration aircraft, that’s like a sin (no offense)
The Blue Angels are a demonstration squadron, not a fighter wing
creations-chat 2022-01-29 01:45:29 Now I feel concerned on what you used to make that in terms of reference images
Definitely a lot better than the Super Hornet I’d say
creations-chat 2022-01-29 01:48:21 Hmm… this is giving my ideas on a  small(ish) scaled CV-22 build since I live basically close to them
This is PCC, you won’t find a “good” or “awesome” unless your build is actually “good” or “awesome”, sad reality but that’s just how things go around these parts of Plane Crazy
creations-chat 2022-01-29 01:52:19 The issue with a popular build is that you have a lot of competition and expectations are high, but making something rare or underrated can cut you a bit of slack, but people will still have high expectations out of you
creations-chat 2022-01-29 01:56:50 If it’s suppose to serve as some sort of hide so you can kinda hide yourself from ariel attacks, then that’s not the way to go
Most paint jobs like that would stay in the spawn area and it would still show the build from a mile away
<@!551806781609869313> honestly quite incredible
creations-chat 2022-01-29 02:00:06 And they spam either smoke pipes, snow pipes, trails, or everything I just said

Fair enough

creations-chat 2022-02-05 04:24:59 If I remember correctly, it was a collab fighter with 2 other people right?
creations-chat 2022-02-05 04:28:27 Not the greatest method, but the algorithm would hopefully turn in your favor
creations-chat 2022-02-05 05:53:40 Is that an SSC or something, I’m a fan of the detail on the lights especially the fact they aren’t glass and are solid colors
creations-chat 2022-02-06 01:26:34 If it’s going for HOF, it’ll be best to change the livery since there are so many Tomcats with that similar livery (Black mask/canopy or whatever it’s called plus the black & yellow stabilizers). Changing it up would probably give it a higher chance, but there are also so many other Tomcats and more on the way. Maybe something like the Black Lions or Pukin’ Dogs would benefit it
creations-chat 2022-02-06 01:29:18 rip, but the idea of a different livery would hopefully be considered
creations-chat 2022-02-06 01:38:40 Hmm how interesting, I’d say go for it
creations-chat 2022-02-07 04:13:45 It is possible to make a decent looking PvP fighter, even though it may not perform as good as it looks
@Mr.Grille#5747 a typical welcoming party from PCC
Wow a ping isn’t possible for me lo
Balance looks and performance
creations-chat 2022-02-07 04:16:31 Not all PvP fighters are the ugliest things in the world, If you know what you’re doing that is
creations-chat 2022-02-07 04:19:36 I started the same year as you then, it just takes commitment and motivation to learn fast
Just about everyone has the same amount of skills, it’s the amount of effort given that varies (Someone is probably gonna pull up with an **Objection!**, oh well)
creations-chat 2022-02-07 22:30:37 Welp it’ll take you about less than an hour depending on how much you talk
creations-chat 2022-02-08 06:05:40 Nice art
creations-chat 2022-02-09 01:49:14 If you find yourself fancy, you can pull off a curved intake even at a small scale
creations-chat 2022-02-09 01:58:16 Trails and control panels
Also 1 piston lock
creations-chat 2022-02-09 23:43:37 Just from looking at that Viper, the intake I have might be too big for that specific one
creations-chat 2022-02-09 23:50:05 The problem with no rank is no vip lol
creations-chat 2022-02-10 02:15:17 <:Pinged:508027985190715457>
creations-chat 2022-02-11 15:51:46 COFFIN camera system lol
creations-chat 2022-02-11 16:03:00 Basically yes, sensors and the cameras on the outside and anything that’s outside the aircraft would show around the pilot inside the aircraft
creations-chat 2022-02-12 05:43:53 Depends on which livery you look at, the newer F-35’s have a 2-tone fade from a pure gray to a blueish-gray. But even if you look at the older F-35’s, it doesn’t hurt to try to paint the leading edges and such a lighter shade
creations-chat 2022-02-12 05:55:36 U can test out this color for the engine:
80, 75, 70

Overall, not too bad so far for it’s scale. You can alter the engine color a bit if you want
creations-chat 2022-02-12 18:26:36 Blower*
creations-chat 2022-02-20 03:05:51 I’m guessing the guy figured out how to make the Viper intake I posted here a while back. Unless he already knew how to make it before me
creations-chat 2022-02-20 17:24:34 You’re right, it’s PCC we’re talking about
creations-chat 2022-02-26 16:47:37 funky stuff, here u go, feel free to use

creations-chat 2022-02-28 23:21:57 I see viper, so here’s mine so far. Still wip, roast me
creations-chat 2022-02-28 23:24:13 Thanks for roasting me, appreciate it
creations-chat 2022-02-28 23:26:52 The whole point in it was simplicity, but even that wouldn’t save it
<@!375281006091173890> You’ll have to wait a bit, and I know for sure you won’t like the top down shot
creations-chat 2022-02-28 23:44:04 I'll wait
creations-chat 2022-02-28 23:46:37 Well that was unexpected, I’ll see what I can do, thanks
creations-chat 2022-03-03 03:26:51 Don’t get so caught up with what people usually say here, the only reason why arguments and such occur here is because someone says something and the other person decides to talk back on “why are you being hostile”, either read it and forget it, or not read it at all
creations-chat 2022-03-03 03:30:41 The build speaks for itself, if it’s good, people will either not say anything about it, or have a compliment or two. Unless you want to get feedback (aka, get your dreams demolished)
<@!902021520900124752> I wouldn’t say that if I were you, there **will** be a high chance of a storm brewing

help 2022-03-08 16:38:16 I’d go with the right side, also that part is called the LERX
creations-chat 2022-03-09 21:16:38 It’s a simple yet effective (in a way) design for a Viper intake
creations-chat 2022-03-09 21:20:20 Yeah, but name changed
creations-chat 2022-03-12 04:54:24 With a different name yes
creations-chat 2022-03-26 22:44:36 Prop angles are different and the planes positions are also slightly altered
creations-chat 2022-03-29 18:01:47 Vipers are tiny irl, still 2 blocks lmao
creations-chat 2022-03-29 18:43:45 SU-27’s are as big as B-17’s
creations-chat 2022-04-07 01:46:08 decent for a 1-block wide F-4J so far? Or do you want me to somehow add a weathered effect to the livery and other cosmetic changes
creations-chat 2022-04-07 01:48:56 I'll cover that, I just added blocks and details straight from the PvP version of the J, so some of the aspects I forgot to change
creations-chat 2022-04-07 01:56:38 I'm not sure if that's good or bad, but I guess the livery is doing a good job at making it look alright
creations-chat 2022-04-07 02:01:19 Hmm... **not enough?**
creations-chat 2022-04-07 02:04:40 How about I move the plate things for the intake closer to the fuselage, would that work too?
creations-chat 2022-04-07 02:12:17 I went braindead from multitasking but I see your point, I'll try it
creations-chat 2022-04-07 02:24:06 I can fill gaps, that was all for the M2M (Motor 2 Mouse) system from the PvP F-4J I have. I can change it up (basically made the thing fly decently)
creations-chat 2022-04-07 02:27:30 Tail designs are not fun, I forgot to change the paint after altering the materials and idk how 1.5x1.5 engines will do exactly. I mean I can attempt to experiment with it
creations-chat 2022-04-07 02:34:58 Heavy surgery would be needed for the design to be at least decent, but yeah it seems fixable (also messed up the rudder colors)
creations-chat 2022-04-07 02:37:48 Rudder/Yaw control might as well be gone, but it's a show jet at this point so idk what else to sacrifice
help 2022-04-11 04:16:05 Numis is just gonna work on it later
creations-chat 2022-05-14 21:12:56 F-15 intakes have variable angle to them, so it doesn’t exactly matter what mode they’re in

creations-chat 2022-05-26 22:41:42 27*
creations-chat 2022-05-26 22:53:16 Already showed it (forgot to turn off ping mb)
creations-chat 2022-06-11 17:32:42 Quite a lot of props you have there
creations-chat 2022-06-11 17:35:22 He said it doesn’t fly well, so he needs some extra pitch
creations-chat 2022-06-11 17:39:34 Just take whatever feedback is necessary and that’s it, trying to fight back just because of them saying you’re bad would only render your reputation to literally nothing.

creations-chat 2022-09-25 03:11:14 The 10% of the whitenames being decently skilled players who don’t want ranks because they don’t want to, or the fact they can be apart of the whitename stereotype but know that they’re better than the 90%

Like me, I like it when people surprise others with a good build but have no ranks. I don’t do it anymore cuz I got nothing to show
creations-chat 2022-09-29 05:49:50 PvP: Haul ass, go fast, think fast
creations-chat 2022-09-29 05:55:13 The faster it goes, the less effective cutters become without blacklist, so it probably has ranged weaponry to counter that weakness which wouldn’t be shocking

creations-chat 2022-10-14 00:51:42 Fair enough, I’ll post images soon. I’m bored and I have time to kill
creations-chat 2022-10-14 01:08:28 So after an unusual amount of time later having to deal with a breaking wip MiG, I got the shots ready... well 3 of them. Go nuts it's a 1-wide

creations-chat 2022-10-14 01:57:01 So you’re making the early protoype F-35A rather than the modernized and more capable F-35As that are in service

Cuz this one has the differently shaped elevators and such
creations-chat 2022-10-14 02:00:53 Wowie look it’s Dark, he’s a cool guy
creations-chat 2022-10-14 02:12:54 But you’d get forcefully grounded and sent elsewhere cuz not only you might damage the plane and yourself, you’d also be revealing the capabilities of the F-22 (the U.S. Air Force wouldn’t like that)

creations-chat 2022-10-15 01:00:22 That’s a FNF pfp btw
creations-chat 2022-10-15 01:04:09 Thanks for the correction, but the second part seems like unnecessary predictions made out of thin air just to show superiority over someone else for literally no reason at all. There are better ways to evaluate someone else’s claims
creations-chat 2022-10-15 01:06:41 Correct, but your claim on me isn’t fact so we’re both wrong about each other. We’re on equal footing

Randome that’s the same plane but just an earlier model
creations-chat 2022-10-15 01:11:59 Randome you messed up

creations-chat 2022-10-15 02:10:27 I have my doubts on that second statement

Hello it is I
creations-chat 2022-10-15 04:01:01 I would personally cam lock or angle lock the front of the vertical stabilizer so it has a more accurate shape
creations-chat 2022-10-15 19:02:56 Get rid of people, because we are the reason we kill everything including ourselves
creations-chat 2022-10-16 03:57:12 I thought that was a 37
creations-chat 2022-10-16 04:05:46 I figured the 37 since that blueprint doesn’t show any signs of folding wing mechanisms or lines that divide the wings into 2 separate parts, plus the tip of the vertical stabilizers are straight instead of slanted
creations-chat 2022-10-23 02:17:33 Wow a tandem seat Lightning II
creations-chat 2022-10-23 22:41:26 Y’know, there’s also that other intake design utilizing control surfaces. But I figure you already know about this style considering you made that T-2 awhile back
creations-chat 2022-10-23 22:44:04 You can’t even post images yet since you aren’t lvl 3

Thanks man
creations-chat 2022-10-23 22:48:14 It’s the same size being 1x2 and since the current intake you have matches the size of the one most people use nowadays, well that’s kinda why people would mention the control surface style
creations-chat 2022-10-23 22:55:53 When he gets image perms then yeah
creations-chat 2022-10-24 15:59:29 2021 Phantom

creations-chat 2022-11-07 23:50:54 F-35 with XA100, who knows how fast it goes now
creations-chat 2022-11-07 23:55:24 You have a better chance with a MiG-35, just pray your missiles can work
creations-chat 2022-11-07 23:58:53 But you’re better off in a MiG-35 because you’re a Fulcrum and Fulcrums are simply better fighters, it’s just Russia not giving MiG a chance at making something good
creations-chat 2022-11-08 00:01:29 That’s a MiG-31 not a 35, also MiGs were the ones carrying the Soviets back then
creations-chat 2022-11-08 00:04:46 Because the Russian government was more into Sukhoi with their projects like the 47 which led to the 57, MiG couldn’t make something good if the government wasn’t gonna let them have the time and fundings to do so

Yes they had the 1.44, but they were competing with the 47, a jet made by and only Sukhoi without fundings from their government, but rather from the company itself
creations-chat 2022-11-08 00:10:18 Did you watch that one video and actually think the 1.44 would legitimately compete against the Raptor in a duel, both the 47 and 1.44 didn't make it into production due to the changing battlefield, the SU-47 was the gateway to Sukhoi making the SU-57, yet even that so far doesn't seem to have a bright future against especially a Raptor
creations-chat 2022-11-08 00:15:39 So the B-17 sized fighter or a 35D Fulcrum against a Raptor
At least send out the SU-35 since that’s a little more capable and modernized
creations-chat 2022-11-08 00:18:28 But we have to think here, this ain’t gonna be some Growling Sidewinder video where there’s first a merge then the fight, no you go BVR or nothing first and hope you live long enough to get into visual range

And you ignore the fact fighters would engage in a BVR type of scenario first
creations-chat 2022-11-08 00:22:33 So you’re saying that you already know that the Flanker would die in this situation?

So we can *possibly end* the discussion here (I don’t count this as a genuine argument)

Russian pilot meets a Raptor and it die basically

creations-chat 2022-11-08 01:07:11 The 23 was debatable on whether or not it was considered “good” for what it was from what I’ve heard

Hello to you Coral
creations-chat 2022-11-21 05:34:39 I would personally go with the right
help 2022-11-21 05:35:02 Do not have 4 EMLs
help 2022-11-21 05:35:28 The recoil from the launchers would overthrow the A-10 even at max velocity
help 2022-11-21 05:37:41 PLEASE just consider the following
help 2022-11-21 05:41:17 What kind of deal making have you done
help 2022-11-21 05:41:45 You’re not gonna use nam’s tnt launchers for EMLs right?
help 2022-11-21 05:41:48 right?…

help 2022-11-21 05:42:45 right?…
help 2022-11-21 05:44:15 Do not join the same pvp server as me
help 2022-11-21 05:45:54 I wouldn’t worry about if it can survive a hit or two, just make sure you can actually fly and avoid the dangers known as wacky PvP fighters
help 2022-11-21 05:47:54 That will not save you because other PvP fighters with more than 2 braincells have motor 2’s as well

help 2022-11-21 05:55:01 You still need to reconsider the 4 EMLs on an A-10
help 2022-11-21 05:55:27 reconsider the loadout for the A-10
help 2022-11-21 05:56:13 nah
help 2022-11-21 05:56:20 EML is WORTHLESS
help 2022-11-21 05:57:07 I would say TRUE, but I would probably get shot many times in the head for saying it
help 2022-11-21 05:59:20 wow
help 2022-11-21 05:59:28 idk if that's impressive or concerning
help 2022-11-21 05:59:35 probably both

help 2022-11-21 06:31:58 Motor 2 for wing sweep
help 2022-11-21 06:32:02 sweep
help 2022-11-21 06:32:55 I mean, the Tomcat’s wings are variable sweep so the load wouldn’t be that much compared to fixed wing aircraft
help 2022-11-21 06:36:36 Newer tomcat
help 2022-11-21 06:36:40 You can tell by the engines
help 2022-11-21 06:37:20 I just look at the nozzles and say “no way in hell that’s an F-14A”

help 2022-11-21 06:48:42 Cuz I’m pretty sure GD got bought out or became a branch under Lockheed
help 2022-11-21 06:49:14 Same occurred with McDonnell Douglas and Boeing, they just got bought out straight
help 2022-11-21 06:51:01 When the Legacy Hornets were rolling out, they were McDonnell Douglas and Boeing
help 2022-11-21 06:51:03 I think
help 2022-11-21 06:51:15 Idk
help 2022-11-21 06:51:52 This threw me off
help 2022-11-21 06:52:16 That’s Boeing’s work, I mean the F/A-18A’s, B’s, C’s, and D,s
help 2022-11-21 06:52:29 The Hornets before the Super Hornets/Rhinos

help 2022-11-21 06:53:16 That plane
help 2022-11-21 06:54:39 Those are the tiny things sticking up on the LERX right or something else?
help 2022-11-21 06:54:55 The trapezoidal fins or whatever
help 2022-11-21 06:56:01 The part directly on the LERX, you can see in front of the vertical stabilizer and above the intake
help 2022-11-21 06:56:21 Second option
help 2022-11-21 06:56:30 Yeah that thingy
help 2022-11-21 06:57:09 Both methods work, but the second option involving good TWR is the better choice
help 2022-11-21 06:57:30 Idk all parts of the earlier Hornets
help 2022-11-21 06:57:42 Balanced airframe
help 2022-11-21 06:58:23 Yeah you know this stuff more than I do
help 2022-11-21 06:59:42 nobody does conv fights now
help 2022-11-21 06:59:49 Too much of a learning curb
help 2022-11-21 07:00:02 Or curve
help 2022-11-21 07:00:45 The issue with props is that they aren’t that useful at higher speeds, so as soon as your opponent makes you go into the higher SPS fights, you’re kinda done for
help 2022-11-21 07:01:05 Because dampening
help 2022-11-21 07:01:55 Uhh just make the plane balanced and place wing panels at the front appropriately to the point your plane can handle good SPS
help 2022-11-21 07:02:17 I never got a good definition of dampening to use as I’m still no master at using it
help 2022-11-21 07:03:04 Do you find yourself studying this stuff for fun or is this just basic knowledge for you?
help 2022-11-21 07:03:35 You just learn something new everyday
help 2022-11-21 07:04:07 I’m pretty sure you take lessons and learn the plane first
help 2022-11-21 07:05:07 You need a lot of props in order for it to actually have an effect on you mid air and going full throttle
help 2022-11-21 07:05:17 You’d only do that for taxiing
help 2022-11-21 07:05:35 Or if you’re a Viggen
help 2022-11-21 07:05:43 Because your a Viggen
help 2022-11-21 07:06:18 I’m this scenario, he wants to go backwards mid flight
help 2022-11-21 07:06:24 Not a turn
help 2022-11-21 07:06:37 Just instant deceleration and back
help 2022-11-21 07:06:43 Well not instant
help 2022-11-21 07:06:46 But quick
help 2022-11-21 07:07:00 Not at all
help 2022-11-21 07:07:07 Just decelerate
help 2022-11-21 07:07:10 A lot
help 2022-11-21 07:07:59 Yeah, but even then it wouldn’t be logical in any way
help 2022-11-21 07:08:19 Like, you can pull it off, but like what’s the point in it
help 2022-11-21 07:08:44 I wouldn’t really add guns directly on top
help 2022-11-21 07:09:01 Cuz the enemy wouldn’t be directly above you
help 2022-11-21 07:09:14 They would be behind and a little bit above you
help 2022-11-21 07:09:28 Varies on the intellect of the opponent
help 2022-11-21 07:10:50 Also the lack of consistency the guns have
help 2022-11-21 07:11:03 They have a higher chance of glitching the opponent rather than damaging them
help 2022-11-21 07:12:14 Which is why I never use guns now for all aircraft
help 2022-11-21 07:12:56 https://streamable.com/fr2s57 I’m literally just all missile

help 2022-11-21 07:18:32 You need at least 1 braincell to use GM because it has some sort of learning curve

help 2022-12-01 02:50:34 you have 8 hover thrusters and 1 motor
help 2022-12-01 02:50:41 ok
help 2022-12-01 02:50:53 that ain't enough rows to make it move
help 2022-12-01 02:51:19 how many per row
help 2022-12-01 02:51:26 and how many motors used
help 2022-12-01 02:51:35 also you only need **1** motor

help 2022-12-01 02:52:26 I'm talking about a **single motor** for **every single drive**
help 2022-12-01 02:52:32 Like, one row with the motor
help 2022-12-01 02:52:37 the rest none
help 2022-12-01 02:52:50 but you said you had 2 motors
help 2022-12-01 02:52:57 you only need 1 at the end

help 2022-12-01 02:57:38 80 motors
help 2022-12-01 02:57:44 first of all
help 2022-12-01 02:57:56 **7 hover thrusters per row**
help 2022-12-01 02:58:28 7 is essentially the optional amount needed in a single row
help 2022-12-01 02:58:53 80 is literally overkill and you won't be going as fast, but rather receive more lag

creations-chat 2022-12-01 03:28:55 It'll be better for 4th gen fighters to just have some jammer pods and such since they weren't exactly made to have stealth in mind (considering when they were developed)
help 2022-12-01 04:00:52 Well you sure ain’t gonna make anything fly with just 2 rows for something that has 4k blocks
help 2022-12-01 04:00:56 It just won’t happen
help 2022-12-01 04:01:09 Doesn’t matter if you fit 100 hovers per row
help 2022-12-01 04:02:12 You only need a single tower
help 2022-12-01 04:02:22 I already made 5 rows with a single tower

help 2022-12-01 04:06:24 Go front and back
help 2022-12-01 04:07:06 You did have the VTOL system have separate keybinds from the conv drive right
help 2022-12-01 04:09:55 So a heavy VTOL that can’t actually go forwards huh
creations-chat 2022-12-01 04:10:15 Fox 2!
help 2022-12-01 04:11:52 Your only main hope for that honestly is to either retune the thing or get a conv drive working, because there’s almost no way a conv drive would affect the VTOL system unless they share keybinds
help 2022-12-01 04:12:05 Also some hovers for that lower SPS stuff
help 2022-12-01 04:12:48 In which you can have a conv drive go 600 if you wanted
help 2022-12-01 04:15:59 Well you have 4k blocks making up a ship with VTOL capabilities, so if you go with hover drives, you’ll need a lot of rows to get it moving but suffer FPS issues. Most other sources of thrust probably won’t work since they’re most likely weaker than hovers or a conveyor drive. I’d just rebalance and redesign some aspects of the locks and folds so you have space for actual thrust, or just attempt to be a scientist and make a reliable conveyor drive
help 2022-12-01 04:16:34 Just about all ships I see like that have some sort of conveyor drive
creations-chat 2022-12-01 04:54:03 Now I’m curious if that’s your first time using piston lock on an aircraft, it’s been too long so I forgot
creations-chat 2022-12-01 06:32:35 So it’s the only aircraft you have that has piston lock and actually survived from being wiped out so far?

contest-chat 2022-12-02 00:44:33 man with a plan
contest-chat 2022-12-02 02:24:53 I’m talking about in general, suri said he likes sci-fi designs that are “realistic”, all I did was reword it
contest-chat 2022-12-02 02:26:38 I was not talking about orithopters specifically, or any sort of helicopter or rotary aircraft in that matter when I made that message
contest-chat 2022-12-02 02:27:52 I also never stated that orithopters don’t work either
contest-chat 2022-12-02 03:10:37 I can’t exactly show examples if I don’t fully understand someone’s standards and/or expectations on what’s considered good or not just from a couple discord messages, I just learned about suri’s interest in “realistic sci-fi designs”
contest-chat 2022-12-02 03:12:13 You’ll probably have to ask suri about what’s considered acceptable because I don’t have a true idea on what that person’s into
contest-chat 2022-12-02 03:13:09 All I did was just have my take on rewording this message so it might make a little more sense

<@678279674782285824> idk, just go 2k and you’ll have decent SPS for aircraft (depending on the aircraft type)
creations-chat 2022-12-03 19:36:09 If you make the ADF-11F, you essentially need to make the ADF-11, or be a wise guy like Gam3 and don’t make it
creations-chat 2022-12-03 19:39:52 You don’t need to be a grand master at PC to make a plane that can split into two, you just have to know what you’re doing, he can figure it out
creations-chat 2022-12-03 19:56:52 On top? Just place it behind the wing and connect it to the rest of the drone in a way that it works, not too hard
creations-chat 2022-12-03 20:00:41 Of course the motor will be visible, you have to learn to deal with it, or not have the split drone feature at all and say “it’s the player version”, though you basically ruined the entire plane by not including the key feature of it

creations-chat 2022-12-09 14:40:37 Maneuverability testing, also has TVC. It wasn’t just the F-15 that went through it, there’s the HARV Hornet, that one modified F-4, and that F-16 with “canards” though some of those were testing other avionics
creations-chat 2022-12-12 22:30:52 Well that one is, I’ve seen that ingame before
creations-chat 2022-12-12 22:36:04 I had my shot with it, runs on an old frame so it's quite limited. Intake & engine overhaul is planned though if I'm feeling motivated

That makes sense, I too dislike the blocky exterior sometimes
creations-chat 2022-12-12 22:40:54 https://streamable.com/gpyadi depends on how much useless effort you're willing to put into it, my MiG for instance with the louvers
creations-chat 2022-12-12 22:48:51 I was about to finish making the actual intake covers for the MiG until PC made it unspawnable
creations-chat 2022-12-12 23:38:20 Flying slower is better than having the build suddenly break itself
creations-chat 2022-12-13 00:20:10 A long time ago, before the entire build broke. Also it’s only for taxiing and it flew fine. The latest version has a better LERX and almost working intake covers, but then the motors kept resetting themselves which makes the build unusable
creations-chat 2022-12-13 00:23:11 I would find something like that cool, but the build broke so that’s a no. I can remake it, but I risk repeating history with another glitched build
creations-chat 2022-12-13 00:26:17 First off, I have a wip JF-17 that’s suppose to “replace” the MiG, and yeah you can make your own 1.5x1.5 engine if you want

Engine, intake, whatever, you can use it
creations-chat 2022-12-13 00:35:58 The MiG nacelles and stuff?

I can’t even do the locks for the build anymore, so you’re stuck with it in build mode

I’d say around next week cuz this week is all finals, gotta prepare for Wed-Fri since those are the finals days

help 2022-12-20 03:18:58 ^

help 2022-12-20 05:42:26 yeah just lengthen the fuselage
creations-chat 2022-12-20 17:55:45 That’s pretty neat
help 2022-12-22 01:11:19 abusing the averagejoe MKM clip
creations-chat 2022-12-22 05:35:19 I have 2 options right now for this build:

1. I come up with Plan B that doesn't involve as much trails for the nose which would save the motor count and the server lag by a ton. (This will not be fun)

2. Just throw in the towel and never make a stealth fighter again and just work on my half-assed 1-wides since those are things I "enjoy" making

I can see why people don't use trail noses for aircraft, they take up space, huge motor usage, and the game becomes a nightmare when you try to spawn in. This was as far as I got when it came to having a decent spawn. **Configure to edit**
creations-chat 2022-12-22 05:41:38 Lag isn't even a concern to me, what matters to me is if it can actually be spawned reliably
creations-chat 2022-12-22 05:45:25 It's the motors that constantly act up, I attempt to angle them but they just suddenly reset to a certain angle or they reset entirely. I'll try that trick sepia on a different build (MiG)
creations-chat 2022-12-22 05:53:26 I was about to ask about the angle locks lol, I’ll monitor this

<@447221768520859659> I’ve been monitoring this since yesterday, I average around 150-275 ping when spawned with the build in question, but it then descends back to the 70s after about 30 seconds
creations-chat 2022-12-22 06:13:24 Y'know, you're a goddamn savior with your little piston trick. Cuz I think you just resurrected the stupid MiG from being completely forgotten about, thanks. (Don't like the clipping where the IRST is, too lazy to spawn again)

I can finally tie up the build with complete engine covers, some smaller details, weapons, and a livery since it can actually work. Thank god there’s a way to have things work
creations-chat 2022-12-22 06:16:34 Supposed to be an F-35A, but in that shot the nose looks a little longer than it should
creations-chat 2022-12-22 06:22:25 I’ll think of solutions, gotta have at least one build that isn’t some 1-wide
creations-chat 2022-12-22 06:26:05 It’s a pain in the ass, I’m not enjoying it
creations-chat 2022-12-22 06:32:42 I mean, this little guy in which I ended up disliking would be considered a basic fun build for me. Could've been improved a lot but I was already bored of having a 370 block mini build in my saves so...
creations-chat 2022-12-22 06:36:21 cya
creations-chat 2022-12-22 17:03:28 The limits soon doesn’t become us, but rather the game itself holding us back. Which is sad to say the least

That’s 100% understandable
creations-chat 2022-12-22 17:21:33 You can actually remove the bases, but I don’t have the keybinds and settings with me atm

I’ll see if one of my builds with the sparkler trick still works, cuz I showed it to a friend of mine yesterday or the day before and it worked for him
creations-chat 2022-12-22 18:09:29 The method I use still works, a bit bulky but it gets the job done
creations-chat 2022-12-22 18:12:57 I got the settings here, it can be refined more and the green TNT block is just to remove the locks from the sparklers. Also this can work for jet engines too (the cameras at the back aren't needed)

creations-chat 2022-12-23 19:07:12 It’ll probably be better to keep the intakes 1-wide, but reduce the height of the intake by removing the half blocks above the conveyor wedge, plus reduce the angle that’s at the start of the intake leading to the engine

help 2022-12-28 05:07:23 Just avoid using it, especially Roshade because it looks bad
creations-chat 2022-12-29 04:04:44 That’s strange, you posted the ADF-01 Z.O.E while karper made the ADF-01 Falken

Top: ADF-01 Falken
Bottom: ADF-01 Z.O.E
creations-chat 2022-12-29 04:08:08 I just thought one was an early prototype of the other, didn’t know that it had a whole separate name. Z.O.E is essentially a drone age Morgan and the Falken is a whole new aircraft, and yeah it’s more round
creations-chat 2022-12-29 04:11:38 I thought the exact same, I’m not familiar with the timelines anymore and what’s what so I guess the Falken and Z.O.E are two different aircraft that both fell out of favor at some point
creations-chat 2022-12-29 04:16:10 Z.O.E is/was the AI pilot yes, but didn’t know it had its own dedicated ADF-01 model literally called the Z.O.E, no clue why the ADF-01 Z.O.E isn’t featured in the funky family tree of Falken variants. At this point I dunno if the ADF-01 Z.O.E was featured as a enemy aircraft and I don’t want to find out

Hidden prototype can be a possibility
creations-chat 2022-12-29 04:19:32 Oh yeah I forgot that Infinity was the absolute **cluster** of all sorts of aircraft

creations-chat 2023-01-03 05:43:19 So I decided to revisit a wip I abandoned due to the horrible reliability, and I swapped the locks for the angled side trails with Motor 2 Locking. I also experimented with cylinders which turned out to be good fillers so I definitely kept them. The supposed result so far is a 100x more reliable nose that looks very similar to the old one (old nose is the message I replied to), which is motivating me to work on this ambitious project once more but with a more thought-out plan. It doesn't look like a lot of progress but I'll get there eventually (even if it takes another couple weeks/months)

If you guys have any suggestions such as recommended base squadrons/liveries let me know, because I haven't done this sort of thing in months after my F/A-18C you can find in <#384025409945337856>. Also the canopy will not be 1-wide, it'll be wider. The aircraft in question is the F-35A Lightning II. Might be too soon to predict or think of but I want to make this a great quality F-35... maybe even one of the best if possible. Thanks for those who helped or gave feedback on the old nose design btw
creations-chat 2023-01-03 06:00:02 After the main exterior is done then I will 👍
creations-chat 2023-01-03 06:07:04 It ain't that complicated tbh, though I only have 1 side done out of 6 sections and I haven't move the stuff over to make it more compact. So it looks like a lot, but it's only around ~950 blocks or so. I got a lot of space to play with anyway
creations-chat 2023-01-03 06:16:56 It's quite small now I think of it, here's an early version with the default small landing gear

creations-chat 2023-01-03 07:16:01 I’m keeping it the way it is (configure to edit) because I know there’s a high chance it’s not gonna be permanent and it’ll be changed, I don’t want to go through playing hide & seek looking for a single 1x2 for 5 minutes

creations-chat 2023-01-04 17:00:43 This is why I usually just stick to making the average 1-wides since they (usually) don’t have spawning issues
creations-chat 2023-01-04 17:06:07 Sometimes I find springs being a nightmare to deal with when you have a bunch of piston locks

It’s not them being stuck is the issue for me, it’s them actually making the pistons and/or angle lock motors even less reliable then they already are

Decent, but not recommended since they can lead to stability issues

You can try to cam lock it, unless you want GM trim
creations-chat 2023-01-21 21:33:06 Nah not always, as a whitename myself I can confirm you don’t always get shut down by others just because you have no ranks
creations-chat 2023-01-21 21:36:21 Then I’m a whitename that doesn’t experience getting threats due to a lack of ranks, maybe builds but not often

It’s a stereotype issue, majority of whitenames that post in <#384025409945337856> tend to be substandard compared to others, which gave rise to the “whitename” type. Also the lack of knowledge about the server
creations-chat 2023-01-21 21:39:42 Oh boy the 1-wides from 2021

Builds that are 1 block wide, they usually get diss’d because your R6 avatar arms stick out and it’s not considered “Roscale” for the majority. Also you usually can’t add a lot of details due to the size
creations-chat 2023-01-22 05:27:35 why and how do you have so many lock towers?

creations-chat 2023-04-13 19:45:31 Because people in vip lounge or smth do a vote on whether or not it goes into HOF. If it reaches a certain amount of upvotes, it gets in. But ig majority don’t make it due to other reasons like quality
creations-chat 2023-04-13 19:48:52 A chat/channel where sane people get to talk to each other according to a vip lounge member, you need specific roles to get access to it. Now don’t start asking me what those roles are because all I know is that Contest Winner can grant you access to it (I think)

Those too
creations-chat 2023-04-13 19:52:37 The Master Ranks are the HOF ranks because you need a build to get into HOF to get a Master rank

What’s with the Bri’ish planes?
creations-chat 2023-05-03 02:05:25 You do know people have made the Tempest, the Block 70, the Rhino Block III, the J-8, and most likely the J-4. They just aren’t posted here in the server
creations-chat 2023-05-03 02:08:14 You can’t automatically assume nobody has made something just because it isn’t posted here in PCC

And I realized I forgot to reply to nuclear’s message
creations-chat 2023-05-15 15:18:53 Yeah so you’re gonna share the same problem which is a short and inaccurate nose as his
creations-chat 2023-05-15 15:26:16 Because the nose isn’t equally proportioned as the rest of the build and it’s not a perfect cone irl
creations-chat 2023-05-15 23:23:49 It’s always the damn noses that are hard to manage when making 5th gens, unless it’s an SU-57 (had to decide whether or not to consider it an actual 5th gen)
creations-chat 2023-05-15 23:29:32 I agree!!

creations-chat 2023-05-16 17:38:03 what’s with the locks at the wingtips?

You could’ve done that lock differently then, stack two motors on top of each other with the base of the motors as the bottom
