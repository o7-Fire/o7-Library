creations-chat 2022-07-23 20:55:06 <@415999725167443979>  you should try using more motorlock on the jet. the cockpit itself is fine, but thats the only thing thats fine.
dont try using jet engines for the intakes either, as that just makes you look stupid imo and jet engines dont even produce good amounts of thrust so dont give me that crap.
also, using the motorlocking would allow you to have a smoother and better looking jet, because right now it just looks you slapped a couple tutorials on a shitty jet and sent it into <#384025409945337856>  (not the latest jet, the one you posted right before it, since you just posted a new one)

also <@889352129561649162>  you need to talk in this server to get image perms (do !rank in <#384027830192832513>  to see your rank, at rank 3 you get image perms)
