bug-reports 2018-11-30 22:47:37 I return from resetting but I don't like to do tat. It crashes other ppl probably and causes lag
bug-reports 2018-11-30 22:47:46 that*

bug-reports 2018-12-01 00:46:18 I just spent at least an hour continuing to build on something and when I clicked save twice, I assumed it saved. But apparently, it didn't save and now I'm really annoyed and confused on why it loaded to the previous form of my build I was editing on and nothing changed..
bug-reports 2018-12-01 00:48:27 Maybe
bug-reports 2018-12-01 00:49:09 I checked the data which I thought I didn't need to but I guess I do.
bug-reports 2018-12-01 00:50:05 Is it possible to add more data to a build? rickje?
bug-reports 2018-12-01 00:50:15 When an update comes?

bug-reports 2018-12-01 00:52:37 I've heard that ppl went over 4000 blocks when building. Can they save those builds or no?
bug-reports 2018-12-01 00:53:04 huh. Cuz im at 1400 and my data is full.
bug-reports 2018-12-01 00:53:07 Explain?
bug-reports 2018-12-01 01:00:48 could you expand the building area? Is that a thing that can be changed?
bug-reports 2018-12-01 01:01:24 The hell is Hard coded?

bug-reports 2018-12-02 04:56:11 I went over the save data apparently. Idk what to do now.. (Also could someone make it so when other builds collide with each other it doesn't spaz out? I have a Heli carrier and it usually is a little glitchy. If there's a way to fix it then thanks.

bug-reports 2018-12-19 01:35:26 {System} "The chat filter is currently experiencing issues and messages may be slow to appear." I hate that message and the reason it's their
bug-reports 2018-12-19 01:35:44 Any way to fix messages for being _______ or no?
bug-reports 2018-12-19 21:41:33 Just find a way to place it. like place other blocks in order to get it where u want it. If that makes sense.
bug-reports 2018-12-19 21:42:23 And those "ghost blocks" can be solved by moving your build in another spot with the yellow tool thingy.
bug-reports 2018-12-19 21:42:38 That's what I do and it seems to work for me.
creations-chat 2018-12-19 21:46:34 I watched a tutorial once on how to make a helicopter cuz I suck at making them. The tutorial didn't help. It just did loops and looked terrible. That's why I don't use tutorials. lol
bug-reports 2018-12-20 00:37:48 This type of computer language your speaking is to advanced for me. lol You guys are obviously good at coding. Some people just might underestimate the power of the dark si- of your coding capabilities.

creations-chat 2020-10-27 13:57:41 yes, they work best with motor 2
creations-chat 2020-10-27 13:59:09 servo, max angle like 45 or seomthing, speed is whatever
creations-chat 2020-10-27 14:00:39 when u set it to servo, it acts like a normal motor but with a max angle, and it resets automatically I think
creations-chat 2020-10-27 14:01:51 > Oh well, people are probably gonna hate the control surface vent wings plus on big builds its just cringe
<@!720751430595772418> I very much agree
creations-chat 2020-10-27 14:03:12 I mean yeah, but why? Just use custom control panels. Realism is better
creations-chat 2020-10-27 14:04:48 > well, remember the wings are at a 40 degree angle so that'll look discustang
<@!658829907110920192> ..what. The wings aren't at a 45 degree angle, the custom control surface parts GOES to that angle or whatever angle you set it to, preferably 15 - 45

creations-chat 2020-12-07 23:00:19 <@!746383586755870821>  I'm gonna be honest the unpainted version looks better than the painted versions
creations-chat 2020-12-08 00:49:13 It looks like you just randomly put blue all over a very bright red painted build which makes it eye jarring to look at and difficult to see any detail that the build has
creations-chat 2020-12-08 00:53:47 Putting blue and red on a build doesn’t instantly make it Spider-Man related <:KEKW:670310537300672528>
creations-chat 2020-12-08 00:56:54 It’s just eye hurting the colors are too bright, no need to be rude when I’m just giving feedback
creations-chat 2020-12-08 01:00:25 Hard to “stay hidden” when the build is as bright as the sun with the poob red and blue splooshes on it
creations-chat 2020-12-08 01:02:34 There was some beauty before the eye hurting colors were added  <:lmfao:527971550360633393>

creations-chat 2020-12-08 01:21:48 Exactly. There is no reason to be mean to someone for making a build that might not look the best, they tried to make something, they shouldn't be insulted on for it

creations-chat 2021-01-06 16:11:43 it's his opinion to downvote something whether he likes the build or not, he has his own reasons. Not everyone has to upvote something because it has 60+ likes
creations-chat 2021-01-06 16:12:41 Unless the reason someone downvotes makes no logical sense/reason, they are allowed to downvote a "good" build
creations-chat 2021-01-06 16:13:07 so no bullying pyro
creations-chat 2021-01-06 16:13:39 depends how much you modified it
creations-chat 2021-01-06 16:14:18 i'm immune to slowmode

creations-chat 2021-01-06 16:15:14 Well yes but most of the time it is because they disliked something on it, or what you said, "builds have some inaccuracy or missing something"
creations-chat 2021-01-06 16:16:58 well yeah, that's the main point of the voting system I think
creations-chat 2021-01-06 16:22:52 When someone downvotes one of my builds I usually dm them and ask them what they didn't like on it and say I want to know out of either curiosity, or a way I can fix it
creations-chat 2021-01-06 16:23:24 so yea
creations-chat 2021-01-06 16:23:27 <:hahaa:773727260539617280>
creations-chat 2021-01-06 16:23:47 Ask him what he didn't like about it and improve that part of the build
creations-chat 2021-01-06 16:25:12 it takes more than that, when yes it shouldn't be lazy and should be unique, it also has to be **very** accurate to what it is supposed to look like or have an insane amount of detail
creations-chat 2021-01-06 16:27:17 I focus on both
creations-chat 2021-01-06 16:27:52 Trust me, they do. You can test that by posting one <:trollface:775024642104229898>
creations-chat 2021-01-06 16:28:21 is that your tank build pyro
creations-chat 2021-01-06 16:29:26 If I'm gonna be honest, that tank is not hof worthy. Hof builds, espeically tanks nowadays, require an imense amount of pog detailing and unique ways of doing so to have a chance of getting into hof
creations-chat 2021-01-06 16:30:41 Big chungus could probaby had been in hof by now if the poob "meme build" rule didn't exist
creations-chat 2021-01-06 16:31:00 Aight
creations-chat 2021-01-06 16:31:44 The angle of the camera matters ***heavily*** to get into hof
creations-chat 2021-01-06 16:31:59 I've seen many builds not get into hof simply because of the camera angle
creations-chat 2021-01-06 16:34:29 If you can't see the quality of the build and all of its quality features BECAUSE of the camera angle, it doesn't go in
creations-chat 2021-01-06 16:35:20 Camera angle is very important
creations-chat 2021-01-06 16:35:41 That tank mainly got in because of the camera angle
creations-chat 2021-01-06 16:35:54 He waited for the sun to get their or something idk
creations-chat 2021-01-06 16:36:18 That tank was poob imo but the quality of the camera angle effort got it in I think
creations-chat 2021-01-06 16:46:23 I might know why
creations-chat 2021-01-06 16:48:50 It didn't get enough upvotes in vip gen. It got 7 upvotes, 2 downvotes. I think the main reason was the tracks
creations-chat 2021-01-06 16:49:15 and it is sorta lacking hof level detail the more you look at it
creations-chat 2021-01-06 16:51:19 might've been the weird looking detail, and the strange picture of it with the text
creations-chat 2021-01-06 16:51:30 It might've went through a hof vote but I don't remember
creations-chat 2021-01-06 16:51:59 The easy part is getting the requirement of votes, the hardp art is the vip gen votes
creations-chat 2021-01-06 16:52:51 you don't know how many times I've been this close 🤏  to hof many more times
creations-chat 2021-01-06 16:58:10 ***yes***
creations-chat 2021-01-06 16:58:16 that is also crucial
creations-chat 2021-01-06 20:05:22 That is cringe to do
creations-chat 2021-01-06 20:49:13 how did you find this

the-dump 2021-01-18 09:29:13 Aight
the-dump 2021-01-18 09:29:26 Averaging Program (30 points)
The purpose of this program is to allow the user to enter as many numbers as he/she wishes and then take the average of those numbers. In the past, average programs we could have written would only allow a fixed amount of numbers. This program alleviates that issue.
In order to write this program, you need to keep track of the running total, as well as a count of how many numbers have been entered. Look at the way I keep track of the number of animals and all the animals entered in my sample program.
Your program must be able to handle different amounts of numbers being entered. Do not have many different variables, it won't help.
Be sure to check for errors and make sure the program validates data and circumvents problems (for example, dividing by zero is not allowed...make it so the program handles that issue gracefully).  Use the examples we did in class to help you.
As always, full comments and a prolog are required.

creations-chat 2021-01-19 04:15:14 it looks really good I'm just wondering if you got your wars mixed up
creations-chat 2021-01-19 04:17:44 yeah but were they previously made from WWI
creations-chat 2021-01-19 04:18:25 WWI is famous for its use of trenches, while yeah WWII did use trenches a little it wasn't nearly as effective as it was in WWI
creations-chat 2021-01-19 04:18:39 true
creations-chat 2021-01-19 04:19:42 wwII isn't entirely famous tho for the trenches it doesn't really make sense to use in a map like that image the guy sent, trenches were the wwI thing

contest-info 2021-01-21 15:00:30 **To clear some things up that Puri said that might confuse you :**

- The build doesn't have to be real (as long as it fits the requirements)

- "Attached cargo that can be separated" means, cargo that is only connected via 
   magnets, disconnectors etc. 

- The cargo has to be able to get outside of the aircraft, and you have to at least make a cargo bay or doors to let the cargo in and out he said.
contest-info 2021-01-21 15:00:38 And remember, cargo **air**craft. So no cargo spaceships, etc. You know, things that look like it should fly.

creations-chat 2021-04-16 03:35:08 How did he obtain those expert ranks when that is his only post in <#384025409945337856> , you need upvotes for expert ranks
creations-chat 2021-04-16 03:35:26 but why
creations-chat 2021-04-16 03:36:39 exactly what I did noob, also do ``in:creations from:Axxel``

creations-chat 2021-04-16 03:42:26 I just scrolled through a bunch of stuff from what Axxel sent and he got the expert ranks from shit builds, so I highly doubt that is even a real tank he managed to make (said himself he got it with shit builds https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/384021699466756107/736796834630074388)
creations-chat 2021-04-16 03:43:07 mhm
creations-chat 2021-04-16 03:44:57 he got the ranks a while ago with bad builds so I think those are real, but this recent photoshopped tank isn't

creations-chat 2021-04-30 06:12:41 if a game takes forever to understand and the controls and such are generally confusing, why would I enjoy playing it
creations-chat 2021-04-30 06:15:34 ^ intended to be easy to understand
creations-chat 2021-04-30 06:15:41 unlike astrocraft
creations-chat 2021-04-30 06:16:47 what even is F3X
creations-chat 2021-04-30 06:16:51 why do you keep mentioning that
creations-chat 2021-04-30 06:17:19 sounds confusing
creations-chat 2021-04-30 06:20:31 also, F3X seems to be completely different to plane crazy so not a fair comparison
creations-chat 2021-04-30 06:21:00 F3X looks to be directed towards an older audiance on roblox or whatever
creations-chat 2021-04-30 06:22:21 to you it seems easy, to the average roblox player it wouldn't be and would be unappealing
creations-chat 2021-04-30 06:22:44 and F3X has a completely different look and style to plane crazy
creations-chat 2021-04-30 06:22:49 again, not really a fair comparison

creations-chat 2021-04-30 14:37:26 can you stop being unnecessarily toxic
creations-chat 2021-04-30 14:38:57 literally everything you say is an insult to some degree instead of actual feedback in this channel
creations-chat 2021-04-30 14:40:02 that's not how you give proper feedback, and that guy is not worse lmao
creations-chat 2021-04-30 14:40:45 good point
creations-chat 2021-04-30 14:40:54 didn't catch that
creations-chat 2021-04-30 14:42:59 the difference is that he gives actual feedback when he does, usually not meant to be an insult
creations-chat 2021-04-30 14:43:28 (that warn was for the bypass earlier)

creations-chat 2021-04-30 14:48:02 not sure why the link did that, but those are times of him giving actual feedback
creations-chat 2021-04-30 14:48:58 let's cease conversation
creations-chat 2021-04-30 14:50:45 1. the fuck does the nsfw warns gotta do with this, 2. he gives more proper feedback than zach_man, 3. they both should know to give proper feedback in this channel instead of just insulting

creations-chat 2021-05-13 05:41:00 you should utilize the textures into the camo
creations-chat 2021-05-13 05:41:09 like slate and wood texture
creations-chat 2021-05-13 05:45:45 ok so
creations-chat 2021-05-13 05:47:28 what I usually do is I take the original color of the block, (lets say its 90, 90 ,90 in the rgb thing) and I go up a couple 10s like to lets say 125, 125, 125. then apply slate texture to that block, and it will look the same as the original color but with texture to it
creations-chat 2021-05-13 05:47:48 some textures do the opposite and you need to lower the rgb numbers by a couple 10s
creations-chat 2021-05-13 05:57:24 you'll get the hang of it once you do it a lot

creations-chat 2021-05-22 21:16:35 I was looking at it
creations-chat 2021-05-22 21:17:47 ah
creations-chat 2021-05-22 21:18:23 from my observations it is missing detail in areas
creations-chat 2021-05-22 21:18:56 like there should be more of the sails on top, the front bit should have more colors, textures, and stuff to make it look like the image thing
creations-chat 2021-05-22 21:19:12 and I think more of the fins need to be on it
creations-chat 2021-05-22 21:19:51 ah ok
creations-chat 2021-05-22 21:20:12 I thought it was finished lol nvm
creations-chat 2021-05-22 21:20:21 but yeah as of now it's pretty good
creations-chat 2021-05-22 21:20:26 getting there
creations-chat 2021-05-22 21:21:02 the weird grey bulb in the reference picture on the bottom of the thing should probably not be made of the huge jet engines
creations-chat 2021-05-22 21:21:26 maybe use the triangle wedge and wedge blocks, and/or half blocks for that
creations-chat 2021-05-22 21:22:17 ye
creations-chat 2021-05-22 21:23:13 I think your build is missing the extended bumper part thing in the front
creations-chat 2021-05-22 21:24:02 it also needs those horseshoe shaped chain things and some of the detail on the top of the elevated part on the hood thing
creations-chat 2021-05-22 21:24:08 lol np
creations-chat 2021-05-22 21:28:08 lemme check, also the slowmode is for everyone but mods are immune to it <:trollface:775024642104229898>
creations-chat 2021-05-22 21:29:15 you should add the rectangular checkerboard styled grill thing to the grill, maybe use the ladder blocks for that or something
creations-chat 2021-05-22 21:30:10 also I just noticed there is a weird like block thing behind the extended bumper thing
creations-chat 2021-05-22 21:30:21 not sure if that is just on that model in the pic but might be good to add anyway
creations-chat 2021-05-22 21:31:19 oh the yeah
creations-chat 2021-05-22 21:31:29 forgot gold bars are actually useful in some cases
creations-chat 2021-05-22 21:32:18 yeah there should be like a little line separating the grill and lights
creations-chat 2021-05-22 21:32:35 np <:hahaa:773727260539617280>👍
creations-chat 2021-05-22 21:33:20 I give actual feedback instead of the "lOw effOrt!!11!" type responses and the unnecessary insults <:KEKW:670310537300672528>
creations-chat 2021-05-22 21:40:40 well no no I didn't see that area in the first pic so ig that does work
creations-chat 2021-05-22 21:40:54 <:hahaa:773727260539617280>
creations-chat 2021-05-22 21:53:17 oh the yea
creations-chat 2021-05-22 22:14:48 yeah it's looking better
bot-central 2021-05-22 22:37:46 <@!603742430323408907> Change your pfp it's a bit sus for the server
creations-chat 2021-05-22 22:38:52 anywhere between the combos ``35, 0,0`` and like ``125, 0, 0`` gives a good dark red
bot-central 2021-05-22 23:28:46 <:hahaa:773727260539617280>👍
bot-central 2021-05-22 23:28:55 That is the best gif pfp I have seen in a while
creations-chat 2021-05-23 00:41:01 make sure to add more of the sails
creations-chat 2021-05-23 00:41:21 also use the textures, preferably slate, and wood for just random detail
creations-chat 2021-05-23 00:41:51 that's a good first boat
creations-chat 2021-05-23 00:45:47 good so far, I suggest also using the slate and wood texture as well
creations-chat 2021-05-23 00:46:12 make the slate and wood match the color of the default texture blocks
creations-chat 2021-05-23 00:46:40 in the rgb thing just go up by like 20 or 30 for each color to do that for slate
creations-chat 2021-05-23 00:47:39 very

creations-chat 2021-05-23 21:36:50 well first, the green buttons that say "offen" are blocking a lot of the build, and the camera angle isn't the best for showing the build off

creations-chat 2021-05-27 03:44:45 what's your best build
creations-chat 2021-05-27 03:46:45 Usually when someone asks for feedback on why someone downvoted, it would be polite to tell the person what you don't like about their build so they can work to improve it. Downvoting without an explanation or reason doesn't really make sense
creations-chat 2021-05-27 03:48:39 the nicer choice would to just simply explain why you don't like their build. Takes like 2 seconds to think why you don't like it and to press enter to send the message
creations-chat 2021-05-27 03:49:02 have you asked for feedback from the people who downvoted?
creations-chat 2021-05-27 03:50:23 why not just answer since he asked you and you are in the chat already
creations-chat 2021-05-27 03:50:45 yeah
creations-chat 2021-05-27 03:54:14 I'm just saying that the more polite option would to give feedback which takes like 2 seconds, and yeah expert designers might be better to ask since they have more knowledge on building and stuff

creations-chat 2021-07-26 05:42:14 I just don’t get the point of disliking the entire thing of furries and shit, I never understood why. If there is a specific furry being toxic then sure, dislike that specific person I guess, but not every single individual
creations-chat 2021-07-26 05:42:24 I never understood it
creations-chat 2021-07-26 05:44:03 It legit makes no sense, think about it: *you know nothing about them other than they like that furry related stuff or whatever*
creations-chat 2021-07-26 05:44:45 I think that’s enough common sense for one night
creations-chat 2021-07-26 05:45:16 You should try to add tracks if you can
creations-chat 2021-07-26 05:45:52 I don’t remember that but was the guy being toxic or something

events-chat 2022-01-10 05:36:17 You can use flying creations like missiles and tiny planes
events-chat 2022-01-10 05:36:21 but they need to be like

events-chat 2022-01-10 06:01:38 check it
events-chat 2022-01-10 06:01:43 is important
events-chat 2022-01-10 06:27:28 Yes
events-chat 2022-01-10 06:27:49 What is an average speed for a plane btw
events-chat 2022-01-10 06:27:58 Or like a small one or something
events-chat 2022-01-10 06:28:19 That seems fast
events-chat 2022-01-10 06:28:22 Is that fast
events-chat 2022-01-10 06:28:43 I don’t want the planes to be not hittable at fast speeds
events-chat 2022-01-10 06:28:55 I think 300 is good right
events-chat 2022-01-10 06:29:14 mm

events-chat 2022-01-10 06:30:08 m
events-chat 2022-01-10 06:30:27 But it adds more variety to the fights
events-chat 2022-01-10 06:31:23 Submarines would be hard to follow with the cam drones, hard to hit if the other guy has a boat or another sub, isn’t a boat technically, and is poo fard
events-chat 2022-01-10 06:32:09 <a:demolaugh:731550644384825366>

events-chat 2022-01-10 06:39:38 Don’t want it too big for camera drone people above, plus it gives people with boats that go 1000000 fast a consequence if they go past the area
events-chat 2022-01-10 06:40:01 It ain’t that small I don’t think
events-chat 2022-01-10 06:40:10 Is fine

events-chat 2022-01-10 14:35:04 Easier for camera drones to follow and makes sure you can’t just go 100000 speed with no consequences
events-chat 2022-01-10 14:35:11 no

events-chat 2022-01-16 04:18:54 is it mech event next

events-chat 2022-01-16 04:38:25 oh oop
events-chat 2022-01-16 04:38:32 I forgor to remove the ping
events-chat 2022-01-16 04:38:45 <a:demolaugh:731550644384825366>
events-chat 2022-01-16 19:46:29 Nah it wouldn’t give access
events-chat 2022-01-16 19:46:45 We’re are gonna try to make events more frequent
events-chat 2022-01-16 20:01:57 <:nooo:787097964946259978>
events-chat 2022-01-16 20:02:09 I thought more people would want to do a mech event ngl
events-chat 2022-01-16 20:16:11 yes
events-chat 2022-01-16 20:23:10 Yes obviously
events-chat 2022-01-16 20:23:27 The template would be to get people knowing how to make a mech
events-chat 2022-01-16 20:23:30 yes
events-chat 2022-01-16 20:26:13 Yes
events-chat 2022-01-16 20:28:34 How is there little skill involved
events-chat 2022-01-16 20:28:46 Also the controls thing is false
events-chat 2022-01-16 20:28:59 You can definitely make it more complex then just the moving
events-chat 2022-01-16 20:29:14 Yeah but imagine if we pull it off
events-chat 2022-01-16 20:29:16 imagine dragons
events-chat 2022-01-16 20:30:00 If it goes well then we might do them in the future, if it doesn’t go well then we won’t, would be a good idea to try it once at least
events-chat 2022-01-16 20:30:13 I’ll obviously give them more than a a week
events-chat 2022-01-16 20:30:44 you really think I’d allow rockets
events-chat 2022-01-16 20:30:46 Bruh
events-chat 2022-01-16 20:31:04 Remember how the battle bot vent was just cutters for weapons
events-chat 2022-01-16 20:31:26 yes
events-chat 2022-01-16 20:31:42 I wouldn’t allow stuff like
events-chat 2022-01-16 20:31:50 Motor 2 turrets
events-chat 2022-01-16 20:31:58 and stuff
events-chat 2022-01-16 20:32:22 Maybe 6 I’m not sure yet
events-chat 2022-01-16 20:32:58 maybe 2 pvp guns
events-chat 2022-01-16 20:33:11 I’ll determine it later
events-chat 2022-01-16 20:33:14 like uh
events-chat 2022-01-16 20:33:38 So like you know how for the boat event a certain size limit was  allowed but folding was acceptable
events-chat 2022-01-16 20:33:54 I agree
events-chat 2022-01-16 20:34:27 There’s so many ideas for mechs idk why people don’t want to at least TRY the idea
events-chat 2022-01-16 20:34:59 fr
events-chat 2022-01-16 20:35:11 Yeah
events-chat 2022-01-16 20:35:37 I don’t want to do another tank battle event there’s been sooo many in the past with like build battles and stuff
events-chat 2022-01-16 20:35:42 I’ve not once seen a mech battle
events-chat 2022-01-16 20:35:44 event
events-chat 2022-01-16 20:35:53 We’ll work around it
events-chat 2022-01-16 20:37:08 Would be a good idea to **try 1** just to see how it goes
events-chat 2022-01-16 20:37:17 Too bad
events-chat 2022-01-16 20:37:19 Cope
events-chat 2022-01-16 20:37:24 We’re doing it <:trollface:775024642104229898>
events-chat 2022-01-16 20:37:33 What if it’s not
events-chat 2022-01-16 20:37:39 Maybe
events-chat 2022-01-16 20:37:53 Define explosive
events-chat 2022-01-16 20:38:18 I’ll give the people videos and stuff on how to generally make a mech walk and stuff
events-chat 2022-01-16 20:38:59 What if there is not
events-chat 2022-01-16 20:39:06 Your assuming there will be
events-chat 2022-01-16 20:39:19 Obc said it’s fine as long as it doesn’t give access to vip general
events-chat 2022-01-16 20:39:30 What
events-chat 2022-01-16 20:39:43 so your saying people who know how to make mechs cant
events-chat 2022-01-16 20:39:45 lo
events-chat 2022-01-16 20:40:09 Interesting idea
events-chat 2022-01-16 20:40:29 Cope toot poot
events-chat 2022-01-16 20:40:51 What would be medium size
events-chat 2022-01-16 20:41:35 We should at least try it, if it goes well then <a:demoConga:585853758353833994> if it doesn’t we won’t do them anymore
events-chat 2022-01-16 20:42:18 Probably on the spot by the rails
events-chat 2022-01-16 20:42:34 Exactly
events-chat 2022-01-16 20:42:46 **we should try it at the very least**
events-chat 2022-01-16 20:42:50 Hmm
events-chat 2022-01-16 20:44:18 Should probably wait until I post the event rules
events-chat 2022-01-16 20:47:02 yea
events-chat 2022-01-16 20:47:41 Interesting idea
events-chat 2022-01-16 20:49:21 How tall is that

events-chat 2022-01-16 20:53:04 Boxing maybe
events-chat 2022-01-16 20:53:06 <:trol2:907404245286920212>
events-chat 2022-01-16 20:53:21 Ok
events-chat 2022-01-16 20:53:30 Should it be boxing styled
events-chat 2022-01-16 20:57:40 Maybe
events-chat 2022-01-16 20:57:48 <:trolltiny:723226233101484033>

events-chat 2022-01-16 21:04:27 y*e*s
events-chat 2022-01-16 21:05:17 would a length and width of 30 be reasonable
events-chat 2022-01-16 21:05:34 30x30x35

events-chat 2022-01-29 23:12:30 If we even allow planes to go faster than like 300 how would hyper be able to catch up and record it, it’s not fun when you have a guy that zooms across the whole map in 2 seconds
events-chat 2022-01-29 23:12:47 That’s why ww1 to early ww2 makes the most sense
events-chat 2022-01-29 23:13:03 Cope
events-chat 2022-01-29 23:13:23 We’re not gonna restrict it to only that but
events-chat 2022-01-29 23:13:41 You just cant make stuff goes over 300 probably
events-chat 2022-01-29 23:14:03 It basically rules out modern jets so 🗿🗿
events-chat 2022-01-29 23:14:22 who is your fren
events-chat 2022-01-29 23:14:34 Ikr
events-chat 2022-01-29 23:14:42 Plus I find it more interesting if they go slower
events-chat 2022-01-29 23:14:50 💀
events-chat 2022-01-29 23:16:15 I’m just saying ww1-early ww2 would make the most sense of what you’d make, not saying you only have to do make stuff from those eras
events-chat 2022-01-29 23:16:22 You can make a fictional design of whatever
events-chat 2022-01-29 23:16:26 Or a thing from a game

events-chat 2022-01-29 23:17:14 Probably won’t allow it
events-chat 2022-01-29 23:17:45 However <:trollface:775024642104229898> there might be no size limit
events-chat 2022-01-29 23:18:20 Only size restrictions might be to not make it so big that it lags everyone 🗿
events-chat 2022-01-29 23:18:41 This isn’t final but I’m thinking of it
events-chat 2022-01-29 23:20:33 What did you even say just now

contest-info 2022-02-21 20:44:59 ```Important I think: Contest channels but better ```

**Bullied obc to finally add a new channel**

<#674101680891101196> is still the channel that is only the image submissions for people's builds (The one where you vote on builds like previously), nothing is different about this channel.

<#609381270237216768> Is now where people can preferably only** POST IMAGES** of their final submissions. I added an inconvenient slowmode to <:trollface:775024642104229898>  so __it should only be where you send your final submissions.__

<#945400465133293639> Will now be where you can freely talk about the contest like normal, but also **POST IMAGES** of work-in-progresses, build images ideas, etc.__ Stuff posted here will NOT go into contest-submissions now.__

contest-chat 2022-04-03 19:38:52 "A spacecraft is a simple common term for satellites, probes, and space stations. A spaceship tends to be used in science fiction for a large and crewed spacecraft that is not a satellite"
contest-chat 2022-04-03 19:39:00 "Is there any difference between a spaceship and a spacecraft?
Quite informally, the two words are synonyms. In formal writing, however, (i.e., in documents from NASA), the term "spacecraft" is always used. "Spaceship", on the other hand, is a quite informal term -- for example, a child might say, "Look at that spaceship!" when watching a science fiction movie."

events-chat 2022-04-10 01:17:01 me and hyper agreed on this
events-chat 2022-04-10 01:17:03 since like
events-chat 2022-04-10 01:17:13 7 contestants would be a comically small event
events-chat 2022-04-10 02:19:44 you can still join

events-chat 2022-04-10 05:16:24 perhaps it is a mere lack of skill that negates you from seeing the gamepasses

events-chat 2022-04-10 17:15:34 it's also been a little bit since we've actually done an event since shep farded the blimp one
events-chat 2022-04-10 19:31:43 not sure if it's going to be today, depends on how many submissions we get since we should have a couple more
events-chat 2022-04-10 19:32:02 I dm'ed hyper earlier if we're doing it today or not
events-chat 2022-04-10 19:32:08 waiting for his response
events-chat 2022-04-10 19:32:30 but whenever we have it, the system should be similar to previous events
events-chat 2022-04-10 19:32:45 in like a private server of hypers or mine of some sort
events-chat 2022-04-10 19:32:48 and stuff
events-chat 2022-04-10 19:56:41 I think we need a little more contestants so

events-chat 2022-04-10 23:33:54 I think it should be

events-chat 2022-04-10 23:34:36 we can probably have it tomorrow maybe possibly probably
events-chat 2022-04-11 00:45:19 wouldn't people die in like 2 seconds if I allow that

events-chat 2022-04-11 11:50:50 It’s whenever we get around 12-16 submissions so I’ll give it like another couple days maybe
events-chat 2022-04-11 11:51:25 Hyper said that ideally we should have around that many people, we also need to confirm they can make it

events-chat 2022-04-30 08:14:29 yes 
its the funny big wheel vertical spinner robot
events-chat 2022-04-30 08:14:36 its a battlebot
events-chat 2022-04-30 08:14:39 wdym
events-chat 2022-04-30 08:15:07 if you think about it tho in the show its very practical in some cases
events-chat 2022-04-30 08:15:33 the main body is high off the ground so vertical spinners can't really hit it, + the wheels are made of a special material that makes it durable
events-chat 2022-04-30 08:15:42 + huge vertical spinner in the middle
events-chat 2022-04-30 08:15:56 hmm

events-chat 2022-04-30 08:17:21 I'm very hyped to see who gets smeeeeeeeeeeeeee
events-chat 2022-04-30 08:17:39 it bends
events-chat 2022-04-30 08:18:07 the idea behind it is that middle section bends when it charges at a bot and allows for the spinners on the undersides on the side to hit the bot on the sides
events-chat 2022-04-30 08:18:34 
events-chat 2022-04-30 08:19:11 I mean

events-chat 2022-04-30 08:20:15 true
events-chat 2022-04-30 08:20:24 depends on who the smeeeeee guy will be matched up against
events-chat 2022-04-30 08:20:49 well that's different, deep six got very unlucky and got a fork stuck in one of the floor hazards lol
events-chat 2022-04-30 08:21:15 let us not forget about Battle royale with cheese

creations-chat 2022-05-10 01:04:37 I'm one of the only mods that even bothers checking this channel because of the dumpster-fire that it is, don't make me get unfunny with you bozos. No insulting, No negativity towards others, literally just give proper feedback to people's builds as that is the purpose of this channel

Any unfunny pointless comments or arguing and stuff toward others will not be tolerated, I'm gonna try to change this channel for the better 
(Just like how I re-did the contests chat to a better organization <:FineTroll:626841259746656289> )

events-chat 2022-05-13 22:19:58 So we had a presentation to do about how to teach the class something and of course I picked "how to do the russian kick folk dance" 💀
events-chat 2022-05-13 22:20:22 I got a 94 on it and someone who did "how to make a baked bean sandwhich" got a 96 

I will never forget this

events-chat 2022-05-14 19:17:04 because you were disqualified for breaking several rules
events-chat 2022-05-14 19:17:31 I said multiple times but I'll say it again:
events-chat 2022-05-14 19:19:12 - 50 speed and 1000 torque weapon motor 
- Another weapon motor on torque of 30 
- Counted yourself down when the round started instead of letting the hosts do it, which the hosts are supposed to 
- rushed before a round started 
- Was on the arena floor with a yellow bit for some of the other fights 
- Was not despawned when the other fights were going on 
- Did not leave the server once the next round started
events-chat 2022-05-14 19:19:58 toggle on powered was on, I was viewing the motor
events-chat 2022-05-14 19:20:12 not sure why you'd even have an unpowered motor with those settigns anyway
events-chat 2022-05-14 19:20:22 on the weapon
events-chat 2022-05-14 19:20:48 the motor was powered
events-chat 2022-05-14 19:21:02 why do you keep saying it wasn't when I was in build mode and flew over and viewed the motor and saw the settings
events-chat 2022-05-14 19:21:26 having any motor at speed of 50 and 1000 torque was never allowed anyway

events-chat 2022-05-15 02:15:10 it feels kind of late to out-rule it at this point since we just had one of the events already 

Besides I think it makes it fair if everyone takes use of it, plus it helps keep bots in the arena and not just fling and glitch out after one hit which is overall, lesser entertaining
events-chat 2022-05-15 03:17:18 Miin was using it
events-chat 2022-05-15 03:18:24 I mean I thought everyone would take advantage of it to some degree since I didn't mention it

events-chat 2022-05-15 05:44:29 Did you use the grav slider
events-chat 2022-05-15 05:45:16 I think the grav slider helps reduce the risk of glitching out a little
events-chat 2022-05-15 16:33:37 lol that would be funny
events-chat 2022-05-15 18:20:54 What version of Madcatter is this bot based off from
events-chat 2022-05-15 18:21:28 this one?
events-chat 2022-05-15 18:21:41 what about the forks
events-chat 2022-05-15 18:21:56 
events-chat 2022-05-15 18:22:14 in like all version I'm getting of mad catter it never had those twin fork setup
events-chat 2022-05-15 18:22:25 under the paw?
events-chat 2022-05-15 18:22:48 hold on ima see some madcatter fights on yt
events-chat 2022-05-15 18:24:02 https://youtu.be/HLWQPbZHaqI You do know that those forks on Madcatter aren't flippers right, they're not supposed to be powered, they're meant to fall to the floor with gravity to better get under people to hit with the vertical spinner
events-chat 2022-05-15 18:24:45 from what clips I recorded the forks seem to like, not work like how they work in the show https://streamable.com/qvuunc
events-chat 2022-05-15 18:30:46 The "flippers" on madcatter are not flippers, they are unpowered forks that are meant to hit the ground and get under oponents to line up with the vertical weapon. They are not meant to flip https://youtu.be/HLWQPbZHaqI
events-chat 2022-05-15 18:30:55 you can see in the real fights of this
events-chat 2022-05-15 18:31:48 and for anyone saying I cheated, whenever I hit someone with the blade, mine slows down and needs a few seconds to power up, you know the torque is on 5 when this happens. You can also see it wind up in the start of my match against this bot https://streamable.com/kzt8d0
events-chat 2022-05-15 18:32:03 I also painted my weapon ice which made it lighter, maybe that made it spin faster
events-chat 2022-05-15 18:32:29 says you who did not even read the rules of this event
events-chat 2022-05-15 18:32:44 you never read the rules
events-chat 2022-05-15 18:32:51 you said that yourself yesterday
events-chat 2022-05-15 18:33:01 oh sure, the classic "it was a joke" line
events-chat 2022-05-15 18:39:08 I didn't mention grav slider in the rules, I thought like everyone one take advantage of that 

I didn't specify since I thought of it would help make fights more about weapon to weapon action and damage instead of everyone getting flung out in 2 seconds and the match ending
events-chat 2022-05-15 18:39:59 that's from season 6, it only has one of the forks

His version had 2 powered flipepr forks
events-chat 2022-05-15 18:40:35 also u can see it flopping around and bounding which means its not powered
events-chat 2022-05-15 18:42:18 a **single **lifting arm, you had 2 that had wayy too much obvious torque
events-chat 2022-05-15 18:44:04 those were **unpowered forks**

They were meant to go under opponents
events-chat 2022-05-15 18:44:14 that is also a different season madcatter
events-chat 2022-05-15 18:44:36 jrst madcatter seems to be a mix of 2 version that don't exist
events-chat 2022-05-15 18:45:42 the forks were supposed to be unpowered buddy, his weren't

events-chat 2022-05-15 23:22:40 I think I painted the tips either the metal or diamond plate texture
events-chat 2022-05-15 23:23:18 And yes I know how a spinner thingamabob works <:empty:794431705070174238> however the physics tend to be different in plane crazy sometimes

events-chat 2022-05-16 04:20:46 The world also doesn't revolve around you
events-chat 2022-05-16 04:23:45 People like this server so they stay in and get some ranks, I don't see a problem with it
events-chat 2022-05-16 04:24:01 it's a fun way to express building and stuff in this game
events-chat 2022-05-16 04:24:42 Everything you say has been just starting unnecessary arguing
events-chat 2022-05-16 04:26:20 You didn't have to comment on what he said
events-chat 2022-05-16 04:26:27 Could've just like ignored it
events-chat 2022-05-16 04:26:37 Whatever he says is usually just trolling anyways lol

events-chat 2022-05-16 04:30:21 how long do you reckon he'll keep whining
events-chat 2022-05-16 04:30:38 seems suggestive
events-chat 2022-05-16 04:31:18 That's how this will play out if he keeps whining
events-chat 2022-05-16 04:31:49 If he keeps whining let me know

events-chat 2022-05-16 04:33:26 back
events-chat 2022-05-16 04:33:39 So he's still insulting others
events-chat 2022-05-16 04:34:11 Since you keep doing to everyone else

events-chat 2022-05-16 04:39:36 He's obviously a troll and doesn't care about the server so

events-chat 2022-05-16 04:42:02 quite incredible
events-chat 2022-05-16 04:42:21 Apparently I still share a server in common with him so he could potentially dm me still

events-chat 2022-05-16 04:48:50 There is some I can't just leave in
events-chat 2022-05-16 04:48:56 like dwyane and trol servre
events-chat 2022-05-16 04:49:00 it's too funny !!!
creations-chat 2022-05-16 05:05:48 I mean arguments shouldn't be allowed anyway so 🗿
creations-chat 2022-05-16 05:07:53 sadly yeah but I wanna try to reduce the negativity of the backlash, if someone does post a tutorial, pcc members should just be like "make  sure you don't post tutorials since they aren't allowed and stuff, just so you know" instead of the "stinky bad tutorial stfu whitename!11!1111" 💀
creations-chat 2022-05-16 05:08:03 In that sort of case if that happens
creations-chat 2022-05-16 05:08:04 h
creations-chat 2022-05-16 05:08:23 probably yes
creations-chat 2022-05-16 05:08:39 don't ask me about folding since I don't do that

creations-chat 2022-05-16 05:08:44 wh
creations-chat 2022-05-16 05:16:58 I just got an idea
creations-chat 2022-05-16 05:17:10 What if we filtered the word "whitename" <:stuff:908917207986208828>
creations-chat 2022-05-16 05:24:52 imagine dragons
creations-chat 2022-05-16 05:32:47 For context, Imagine Dragons is an American pop rock band from Las Vegas, Nevada, consisting of lead singer Dan Reynolds, guitarist Wayne Sermon, bassist Ben McKee and drummer Daniel Platzman.

The intended joke that is implied here is that since the name of the band is "Imagine Dragons", it would be quite an ironic/funny coincidence that were to be described as unexpected in a traditional conversation. The average individual would not expect someone to reply with the name of the band, thus bringing the humor towards responding to someone who says "imagine" with, quote, "Imagine dragons." as it is a reference to the band.
creations-chat 2022-05-16 05:32:52 👍
creations-chat 2022-05-16 12:47:22 Stop
creations-chat 2022-05-16 12:47:50 your further solidifying my idea to ask obc to add the word “whitename” to the filter soon
creations-chat 2022-05-16 12:48:28 <:stuff:908917207986208828>
events-chat 2022-05-16 14:18:48 The event winner was given over to the other guy in the finale bracket I think
events-chat 2022-05-16 14:19:30 What about what fight with who
events-chat 2022-05-16 14:19:46 a lot of stuff scrol up

creations-chat 2022-05-16 14:27:48 Idk
creations-chat 2022-05-16 14:28:05 Maybe I’ll threaten ppl with its removal but not remove it <:clueless:942802644043464734>
creations-chat 2022-05-16 14:28:28 Hyper said it’s a poopy idea so idk idjqjsivisjbqgbofiorhll
events-chat 2022-05-16 15:09:20 Yeah the ”flippers” in the front were supposed to be unpowered forks but they obviously didn’t

He also “forgot” to change some settings on some other stuff before he did some tournament rounds
events-chat 2022-05-16 15:09:30 Which idk how you just forget 💀
events-chat 2022-05-16 15:10:06 Then he proceeded to whine and roast everyone for a solid hour and said some no no things and got banned
events-chat 2022-05-16 15:10:18 🗿
events-chat 2022-05-16 15:11:44 I missed the last half of the event yesterday since I had to do stuff but from what I saw his bot was unusually strong, I noticed his weapon never stopped spinning when it hit something which would mean high torque on one of the motors
events-chat 2022-05-16 16:31:27 true
events-chat 2022-05-16 16:31:48 My comically large wheels were extremely effective
creations-chat 2022-05-16 16:43:10 I thought it looked like the elite space guys in halo
creations-chat 2022-05-16 16:44:18 Reminds me of the
creations-chat 2022-05-16 16:44:23 Helmet of these guys
events-chat 2022-05-16 18:03:44 Well his torque was obviously really high on the motors for it, same with the spinner
events-chat 2022-05-16 18:04:31 I doubt that he just “forgot to change it back” during the tournament as he claimed, how do you forget that 💀
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:38:31 I didn’t put the grav slider in the rules so I thought everyone would take advantage of it :(

I don’t remember anyone asking about it so I thought everyone was gonna use it
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:39:12 It made the fights less about flinging out the arena in one hit
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:39:19 made the fights more interesting
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:40:14 I mean I guess I should’ve mentioned it I just thought everyone would use it <:nooo:787097964946259978>
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:40:31 Nobody was saying anything about it so I assumed they were using it
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:41:28 I mean that wasn’t my interpretation of it at the time
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:41:50 Was it not allowed in the previous one?
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:42:11 h
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:42:27 Ok so I goofed up <:nooo:787097964946259978> sorry
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:42:41 I just had a different interpretation on the whole thingamabob

events-chat 2022-05-16 20:44:51 I guess I could ask for assistance or tips with some rules if I need any for stuff
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:45:27 I immediately think of what would happen if you run out of ammo <:stuff:908917207986208828>

creations-chat 2022-05-24 18:30:23 <@719168864705052802> let’s say hypothetically if I were to make a build with little to no motorlock but big details and whatever would you like it <:stuff:908917207986208828>
creations-chat 2022-05-24 18:30:30 (theoretically)
creations-chat 2022-05-24 18:30:43 All hypothetical of course
creations-chat 2022-05-24 18:31:47 Let’s say if it were to look good, would it be more impressive if there isn’t motorlock for at all
creations-chat 2022-05-24 18:32:37 97.63% of detailed builds have motorlock these days from what I’ve seen <:stuff:908917207986208828>
creations-chat 2022-05-24 18:32:48 Wha build did you have I forgor
creations-chat 2022-05-24 18:34:59 It do need more details in terms of the textures and coloring
creations-chat 2022-05-24 18:35:19 Try to avoid using only 3 colors throughout stuff like that
creations-chat 2022-05-24 18:35:23 mix it up with like
creations-chat 2022-05-24 18:35:28 Different shades or something
creations-chat 2022-05-24 18:37:01 Getting hof is about looks and also creatively 

I can’t even express how often I’ve seen a jet go through a voting 🗿
creations-chat 2022-05-24 18:37:31 m

Do the thing with slate and some other textures to raise or lower the color of it to match with a default block
creations-chat 2022-05-24 18:38:08 not entirely but mostly
creations-chat 2022-05-24 18:38:51 what build did Hars get in HoF 

Also keep in mind, the standards for builds have drastically increased
creations-chat 2022-05-24 18:40:00 I’d upvote a HoF build if it’s creative, doesn’t even need to look good **imo**

For example, a detailed Bv-111 would automatically have my vote <:trollface:775024642104229898> <:stuff:908917207986208828>
creations-chat 2022-05-24 18:41:57 Ig at the time that was good idk

I’d downvote that if it went through a vote nowadays

1. Exposed weird looking motors
2. A jet 
3. Weird paint in areas 
4. 💀
creations-chat 2022-05-24 18:42:54 Now if someone made a twin fuelsage version of a jet like that then you’d have my attention (creavity)
creations-chat 2022-05-24 18:43:00 Imagine dragons
creations-chat 2022-05-24 18:43:38 Imagine even using motorlock in building 

Imagine dragons
creations-chat 2022-05-24 18:47:06 I need another camera angle but from what I see: 

1. Weird rudder
2. Landing gear look weird with the springs 
3. The lowest row of windows and the paint job don’t clash together rather well

creations-chat 2022-05-30 21:32:38 Gentlemen, let us be so rational throughout the remainder of this conversation, I suggest it would be most beneficial to not continue onward with such vulgar language in ways to describe such individuals. 

<@883063424614006878> <@738091123590824000> Thus so I may not express enough to knock off of this dilly dally, nonsensical behavior of tomfoolery you both so proclaim. While you both bring forward rather convincing statements from both parties, I must rightly so end this conflict before it escalates.

I would allow jets normally but every mf just gonna make any type of jet If I do that since the word Jet starts with J
contest-chat 2022-06-08 22:06:38 idk what that is but it starts with J so that's fine
contest-chat 2022-06-08 22:07:09 that specific vehicle yes since its starts with j

contest-chat 2022-06-17 07:30:16 Do people STILL not know how contests work by now
contest-chat 2022-06-17 07:30:57 This is how contests always go, the low effort uncreative ideas get submitted within the first hours-days, the actual good creative submissions are submitted on the last day
contest-chat 2022-06-17 07:31:09 This baffles me that people still don't know this system

contest-chat 2022-06-17 07:32:47 <@438388553442131988> when you submit your build it has to start with J 

yours starts with m technically <:trollface:775024642104229898>  

also please for the love of chungus don't make another jar submission we already have like 5 of them 💀

contest-chat 2022-06-17 07:34:15 💀
contest-info 2022-06-17 07:37:19 FYI when you submit your build(s) make sure the first letter is J to make it more funny <:trollface:775024642104229898> 

(As an example, don't have it say something like, "better photo of Joe Shmo" Have it just like , Joe Shmoe"

Also please be more creative, I don't want to see another Jar submission 🗿
contest-chat 2022-06-17 15:44:04 you can’t just name it something that’s starts with J if it doesn’t start with J
contest-chat 2022-06-17 15:44:12 I specified this rule in <#504718138399522832>

If the actual name of that tank thing from fart Thunder does start with J then it should be fine

creations-chat 2022-06-28 05:10:13 EXACTLY my point, he doesn't ask for feedback from someone like fleet since he knows fleet won't give actual feedback for him lol
creations-chat 2022-06-28 05:10:43 fr
creations-chat 2022-06-28 05:10:52 he's just talkative

creations-chat 2022-06-28 05:17:23 if he wants feedback from someone he wants feedback from, he'll ask for feedback from the person he wants feedback from

creations-chat 2022-07-14 22:32:31 Yes because there is literally only 1 obvious intention when randomly saying that specific place
creations-chat 2022-07-14 22:35:45 let me see the vid
creations-chat 2022-07-14 22:36:46 no reason to mention that, saying the word or something similar would still be inappropriate
creations-chat 2022-07-14 22:37:12 Am I able to see the video
creations-chat 2022-07-14 22:39:28 like that makes it any better?
creations-chat 2022-07-14 22:39:31 Let me see the video
creations-chat 2022-07-14 22:40:14 You send it, so you were just viewing it 

If it was on youtube go into the "history" tab, should be there
creations-chat 2022-07-14 22:40:27 I can mute you if you keep being unfunny
creations-chat 2022-07-14 22:41:55 literally when anyone says or mentions a word that is spelt very similar to the n-word or sounds just like it, the obvious intention is to literally bypass the word and play the classic "just a joke its not actually the word smh smh" tactic
creations-chat 2022-07-14 22:42:08 So I am currently very unconvinced until I see the video

creations-chat 2022-07-14 23:03:38 >starts an avoidable argument by calling it shitty without proper feedback

>the other guy's response, "It's normal for me to react like this, look at how you talk about my plane by calling it "shitty". You can just say what's wrong with it without offending the builder" is a valid true claim 

not giving proper feedback and instead, (i.e. calling someone's build shitty) is the exact kind of stuff I'm tryna change in this channel so I can see why yousuf gave you a blacklist after reading back the convo

+ it's yousuf he's the harshest mod <:trollface:775024642104229898>

creations-chat 2022-07-15 00:02:12 1. You must be blind if you've never seen a type of mute something along the lines of "being toxic in [channel name] (counts as a warn)", these are basically the same as a blacklist 

2. When there are people saying slurs and etc in a VC, mods usually take care of it with a mute/warn similar to the one I mentioned above 

3. The first of a specific blacklist can be removed after 30 days, if the same one is obtained again, it is perm. And from looking at the message history involving you I most certainly believe you were creations-blacklisted once before already. If you weren't you should've been and the mods that missed might've forgotten

(chicken cutlets with mashed potatoes and applesauce)
creations-chat 2022-07-15 00:04:31 Yes because in the past no mods were bothered to look in this dumpster-fire of a channel but I have been trying to make this channel better recently (pinned message in this channel says so also)
creations-chat 2022-07-15 00:05:30 How many times do I need to repeat myself holy shit
creations-chat 2022-07-15 00:06:50 1. You SHOULD'VE been given a blacklist at the times I listed
2. YOU may have not seen it when you're online but that doesn't mean it doesn't happen
3. and yes I spent this time out of my day to trace back your warns relating to this channel when you should've received a blacklist
creations-chat 2022-07-15 00:06:58 I'm not restating what I said again

events-chat 2022-07-22 02:15:27 I had to re-read what you said a few time to even understand it all
events-chat 2022-07-22 02:15:59 plus I agree with this
events-chat 2022-07-22 02:16:19 hi
events-chat 2022-07-22 02:16:48 if we're gonna do a creature event like that I'd say to use dinosaurs that have existed before
events-chat 2022-07-22 02:17:10 the clowns are performing another circus again?
events-chat 2022-07-22 02:17:17 I'll go get a front row seat
creations-chat 2022-07-22 02:17:37 are the clowns performing another circus
creations-chat 2022-07-22 02:19:34 summarize the performance from the clowns in this circus since I missed their opening act
creations-chat 2022-07-22 02:20:09 <:empty:794431705070174238>
creations-chat 2022-07-22 02:21:00 is there a message link to the first message that started this

I'll read it down from there
creations-chat 2022-07-22 02:28:51 why was this random trans comment originally brought up and what relevance did it serve to that conversation
creations-chat 2022-07-22 02:29:11 That did not have to spiral down into that whole argument
creations-chat 2022-07-22 02:29:24 plus nobody should've continued filling the flame for that argument
creations-chat 2022-07-22 02:29:53 I could just do what I've been doing and warning everyone in the argument since everyone is to blame and I could care less at this point
creations-chat 2022-07-22 02:31:08 if he was calling you a 12 year old you shouldn't get butthurt over that since it's doublewidesurprise being doublewidesurprise + you should not have brought up gender shit for no reason
creations-chat 2022-07-22 02:32:08 being racist towards the trans or whatever isn't a good idea since that always sparks some sort of debate
creations-chat 2022-07-22 02:32:24 lemme look into some message history rq
creations-chat 2022-07-22 02:33:09 This channel is about **FEEDBACK ON BUILDS** from <#384025409945337856> , not arguing about trans stuff or whatever the hell I was reading
creations-chat 2022-07-22 02:37:37 it's better to not engage
creations-chat 2022-07-22 02:37:54 especially in this server where nobody cares about that stuff since this server is about a roblox game
creations-chat 2022-07-22 02:38:34 I am in creative mode
creations-chat 2022-07-22 02:39:16 I'll not give any warnings or anything this time around but if I leave for 10 minutes and come back and see an argument of anything I'm giving blacklists out
creations-chat 2022-07-22 02:39:25 Just learn to use common sense pls
creations-chat 2022-07-22 02:39:34 The ability to speak does not make you intelligent

creations-chat 2022-07-22 02:42:55 it's a daily occurrence in this channel 

The clowns always have a really interesting circus act going on, they always blow my expectations out of the water in their performances
creations-chat 2022-07-22 02:44:02 I'm not sure but I really want to get tickets soon
creations-chat 2022-07-22 02:45:04 the argument ended I was just saying how this chat is always a circus whenever I see it

Testing a New Contest System ```


Ok so, there will be **2** votes:

``First:``
**Vote for a listed century: **
1. 21st century (2001–2100)
2. 20th century  (1901–2000)
3. 19th century (1801-1900)
4. 18th century (1701-1800)
contest-info 2022-08-19 01:49:03 ``Second:``
**Vote for a listed theme: **
1. Wild West 
2. Steampunk 
3. Medieval
4. Roman/Greek
5. Primitive
contest-info 2022-08-19 01:49:05 ``Example:``
If a certain century gets the highest vote
And if a certain theme gets the highest vote

The contest would be:
Build something *[highest voted theme*] themed, [*highest voted century]* century build

A lot of creative potential, very few (but important) limitations with this system

so vote <:clueless:942802644043464734>

contest-chat 2022-09-14 02:56:48 An attack aircraft, strike aircraft, or attack bomber is a tactical military aircraft that has a primary role of carrying out airstrikes with greater precision than bombers, and is prepared to encounter strong low-level air defenses while pressing the attack.[1] This class of aircraft is designed mostly for close air support and naval air-to-surface missions, overlapping the tactical bomber mission. Designs dedicated to non-naval roles are often known as ground-attack aircraft

maybe make it look good at night time mode
contest-chat 2022-10-07 01:40:37 text signs should work

contest-chat 2022-10-07 01:50:21 I can think of a few ways to make a heli fit for this contest 

- haunted run-down helicopter 
- fleshy disturbing looking helicopter 
- ghost helicopter 

<@984694509772357662>
contest-chat 2022-10-07 01:50:52 this concept but with a heli

contest-chat 2022-10-07 01:52:39 I've done it before

it aint that hard
contest-chat 2022-10-07 01:52:44 just make sure you have a theme

contest-chat 2022-10-07 01:54:08 real
contest-chat 2022-10-07 01:54:47 to make things look organicy, utilize textures (specifically the ones like slate, wood, and sand) make them blend with whatever color it is

creations-chat 2022-10-10 17:57:50 if you have speakers, and since those are sparklers, if you set the sparklers to mousebutton1(or whatever button you use to fire) and have a speaker that has an AA sound looped you can get a cool AA look and sound 

also idk if the ratte had wirbelwind turrets or not but if you want I can supply a fairly decent turret of one

creations-chat 2022-10-12 14:44:10 That’s coming along pretty well

I’d blend the texture bit more by adding a wood/sand texture mix between the slate to the non-textures blocks if that makes sense
creations-chat 2022-10-12 14:45:00 You can make certain textures match default blocks and vice-versa by just going up a few in 10s in the color palette

contest-chat 2022-10-24 08:44:45 It was a test
contest-chat 2022-10-24 08:45:28 I had to see if the creation submitter bot works
contest-chat 2022-10-24 08:45:38 Of which it doesn’t and didn’t work last contest either <:spyMoyai:944415886796791818>

events-chat 2022-10-26 00:22:55 roblox have done several stinkies and made roblox studio wack
events-chat 2022-10-26 00:23:29 let me explain with probably a metaphor
events-chat 2022-10-26 00:25:20 The big man upstairs is having trouble getting up the stairs due to the new stairs that the government forced him to have his old stairs replaced in his house with the new stairs
events-chat 2022-10-26 00:25:24 or something like that

creations-chat 2022-10-26 00:38:43 flattnd
events-chat 2022-10-26 11:58:01 This game is a MUSTHAVE!
events-chat 2022-10-27 03:22:17 they like changed how Roblox Studio looks so it's more annoying to do literally anything
events-chat 2022-10-27 03:22:28 I saw a vid of a roblox dev guy reacting to the changes and he hated it
events-chat 2022-10-27 03:43:27 I don't develop stuff on studio but from what I can it looks super annoying to navigate or just read the icons now
events-chat 2022-10-27 03:43:28 so like
events-chat 2022-10-27 03:43:33 3 out of 10 or something

events-chat 2022-10-27 03:44:55 I precisely remember rick posting an image relating to this at some point
events-chat 2022-10-27 03:45:03 forgot where but I think I saved it because it was funny
events-chat 2022-10-27 03:45:05 lemme find it

events-chat 2022-10-27 03:48:04 <:confident:973332698586296360>
events-chat 2022-10-27 03:51:59 I assume since studio turned stinky that that has delayed the whole process
events-chat 2022-10-27 03:52:19 plus like when a thing breaks roblox doesn't fix it so he has to
events-chat 2022-10-27 03:52:23 or something
events-chat 2022-10-27 03:52:32 we litterally had a whole ocovnersation on this!!!
events-chat 2022-10-28 23:33:12 I’d be fine if someone else (another mod) can do it

contest-chat 2022-11-04 18:53:05 So are we doing terraria contest
contest-chat 2022-11-04 18:53:09 I think we should
contest-chat 2022-11-04 18:53:15 <@866848584888877077> you
contest-chat 2022-11-04 18:53:19 I think
contest-chat 2022-11-04 18:53:34 did you say you wanted to run a contest
contest-chat 2022-11-04 19:02:47 Ok
contest-chat 2022-11-04 22:44:09 cat contest
contest-chat 2022-11-05 18:08:09 A rotorcraft or rotary-wing aircraft is a heavier-than-air aircraft with rotary wings or rotor blades, which generate lift by rotating around a vertical mast. Several rotor blades mounted on a single mast are referred to as a rotor.
contest-chat 2022-11-05 18:08:26 So helicopter type thingamabobs
contest-chat 2022-11-05 19:30:13 Good so far
contest-chat 2022-11-05 19:30:53 Just make sure the message that goes in <#504718138399522832> after the topi voting is in the usual format but slightly tweaked and what-not
contest-chat 2022-11-05 20:40:40 Well if it’s not then we get no submissions since everyone is uncreative and lame
contest-chat 2022-11-05 20:40:45 <:nooo:787097964946259978>
contest-chat 2022-11-05 20:41:16 How about we do a little trolling and only allow the rotor to be on the bottom of the aircraft or something <:trollface:775024642104229898>
contest-chat 2022-11-05 20:41:25 Or anywhere that’s not the top middle <:trollface:775024642104229898>
contest-chat 2022-11-05 20:41:47 Or the build can’t be symmetrical <:trollface:775024642104229898>
contest-chat 2022-11-05 20:41:53 Or <:trol:885640167854071869>
contest-chat 2022-11-05 21:24:53 Perhaps
contest-chat 2022-11-05 21:25:27 <@866848584888877077> thoughts on a rule for this contest to be that your build can’t be symmetrical?
contest-chat 2022-11-05 21:25:32 <:clueless:942802644043464734>
contest-chat 2022-11-05 21:25:50 Would be interesting (or some rule like that)
contest-chat 2022-11-05 21:26:20 yeah.cat.gif.png
contest-chat 2022-11-05 21:30:08 You can try it
contest-chat 2022-11-05 21:32:04 like a list of possible twists:

1. can’t be symmetrical
2. must have 3 rotors
3. rotor must be on the bottom
contest-chat 2022-11-05 21:32:09 Something like that
contest-chat 2022-11-05 22:44:18 <@866848584888877077> a good idea I’ve noticed is to specify what the basic definition is in <#504718138399522832> since there’s always questions like this some how
contest-chat 2022-11-05 22:44:28 I’ve started doing that lately <:clueless:942802644043464734>
contest-chat 2022-11-05 22:45:22 Also we should allow custom/fictional designs I think
contest-chat 2022-11-05 22:45:27 could see some cool ones
contest-chat 2022-11-05 22:45:38 <:obsession:751188888252579952>

contest-chat 2022-11-05 22:46:05 Hmm
contest-chat 2022-11-05 22:46:36 true
contest-chat 2022-11-07 00:54:32 <@866848584888877077> are we not doing the nonsymmetrical twist?
contest-chat 2022-11-07 00:54:37 <a:sollySus:928660253506166854>

events-chat 2022-11-12 00:50:50 The rule set for this event is already chaotic enough as it is
events-chat 2022-11-12 00:51:28 <@378612526151237642> <@740790456182636595> do you guys wanna participate in le battlebot event
events-chat 2022-11-12 00:51:39 Oh god
events-chat 2022-11-12 00:52:29 The rule set to follow is in <#621452102618578964> 🗿
events-chat 2022-11-12 00:52:40 Why not D:
events-chat 2022-11-12 01:17:27 ooo that's a tough one
events-chat 2022-11-12 01:17:29 hmm
events-chat 2022-11-12 01:18:02 I remember this one guy had a bot that like deployed a bunch of smaller ones, I think they all got one shotted lol
events-chat 2022-11-12 01:18:15 uh
events-chat 2022-11-12 01:18:17 hmm
events-chat 2022-11-12 01:18:35 I guess that technecually works with the rules
events-chat 2022-11-12 01:18:40 sure

events-chat 2022-11-12 01:28:43 I see several flaws with your current design
events-chat 2022-11-12 01:28:58 ch
events-chat 2022-11-12 01:28:59 chic
events-chat 2022-11-12 01:29:17 https://tenor.com/view/jerma-jerma985-jeremy-2ndjerma-insane-gif-21020440
events-chat 2022-11-12 01:29:35 oh ok
events-chat 2022-11-12 01:30:07 a big flaw I see is if those forward facing forks are taken out, your bot will just fallforwards since the blade isnt in the center of mass
events-chat 2022-11-12 01:30:09 also
events-chat 2022-11-12 01:30:15 thin struts holding up the thing
events-chat 2022-11-12 01:32:17 add more forks or make current one thicker maybe
events-chat 2022-11-12 01:32:21 or add a heavier thing in the back
events-chat 2022-11-12 01:32:42 cover the top of the wheels with armor incase you fight a hammer bot
events-chat 2022-11-12 01:33:06 perfect
events-chat 2022-11-12 01:36:38 i have no idea
events-chat 2022-11-12 01:36:44 probably at least 3

events-chat 2022-11-12 15:43:41 But I recommend not going too fast or you’ll fling yourself out of the arena space or lose control lol

events-chat 2022-11-12 19:35:37 don't complain about the ruleset if you're not even gonna participate, besides irl physics don't apply to a block build game on roblox
events-chat 2022-11-12 19:37:32 mm
events-chat 2022-11-12 19:37:42 I don't believe so
events-chat 2022-11-12 19:37:58 I think only for weapon motors
events-chat 2022-11-12 19:38:47 if I didn't put a rule for the torque thing on motors used for weapons then we would get a very crazy thing going on of ppl just getting 1 shot flung in like 5 seconds
events-chat 2022-11-12 19:39:04 at least that's what I'm expecting would happen since plane game physics

events-chat 2022-11-12 20:16:44 sure why not
events-chat 2022-11-12 20:17:15 this isn't meant to be that realistic 🗿  it's in roblox + not how this event is structured this time
events-chat 2022-11-12 20:17:54 I don't need to be a nerd in "combat robotics" to host an event like this, we've had this done in the past and it worked out just fine
events-chat 2022-11-12 20:18:11 it did
events-chat 2022-11-12 20:18:50 I thought you did
events-chat 2022-11-12 20:18:54 you one of them I forgot
events-chat 2022-11-12 20:19:50 <@609921899585077296> if you're gonna keep whining and complainging about the ruleset then either don't compete or I can kindly escort you out of this chat
events-chat 2022-11-12 20:20:06 drama ain't supposed to be in here
events-chat 2022-11-12 20:20:44 since we have indivisuals such as tyourself typing an essay abouyt how stinky the rules are 🗿

events-chat 2022-11-12 20:23:24 gotta have some basis of rules down
events-chat 2022-11-12 20:27:54 you could try making another roblox alt

events-chat 2022-11-13 02:19:44 I’ve proved it
events-chat 2022-11-13 02:19:58 LARGE!!’s Achilles heel is hammers
events-chat 2022-11-13 02:20:07 But don’t design your bot specifically to counter mine
events-chat 2022-11-13 02:20:23 I might not even be in the mainline of the competition because I’m too swag and might win again
events-chat 2022-11-13 02:20:45 <:FalconStance3:715614633972727878>
events-chat 2022-11-13 02:21:22 Make a funny spinner
events-chat 2022-11-13 02:21:29 Or base a bot off an existing one in the show
events-chat 2022-11-13 02:22:03 Your bot and Mints are the 2 bots I fear currently
events-chat 2022-11-13 02:22:24 Also
events-chat 2022-11-13 02:22:57 I’m gonna make a small mini version of HUGE and have it zip around the arena when the fights are happening like a Referee

events-chat 2022-11-14 15:22:34 That seems harder to control tho if it’s just a random pvp server 

Like what if a random bingus not even in pcc joined pvp mode
events-chat 2022-11-14 15:23:03 We’ll just do the server thing we did last time

But I’m gonna be making a Red bot with different flags and sounds on it that can call out illegal unfunnies if I see any

contest-chat 2022-12-07 02:09:51 yeah so I usually submit a placeholder image before ending it I forgor

I think it helps with the -contesttop command some how idk

The last build that is summited usually doesn’t appear on the thing without a placeholder image but idk idkqoxodjqbfheu

Just when the voting ends make sure to not forget the last things votes
