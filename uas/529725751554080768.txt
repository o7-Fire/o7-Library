creations-chat 2020-03-13 19:45:07 yeah only sad thing is the front edge of the wing has a slight angle to it and with limited blocks it came out more delta config than I wanted but ah well 🙂

creations-chat 2020-03-13 20:01:01 <@!217336009455566848> This game is amazing and has so much potential please keep it going, suggestions make world map bigger and add more wedges and possibly rounded blocks for future. Thank you for such a great game, I bought some passes and will tip when able.
creations-chat 2020-03-13 20:13:19 nice
creations-chat 2020-03-13 20:14:27 Any pro builders on here? I have a question. How do I make custom landing gear without using the oversized wheels that will actually turn and not just slide? I tried using motors and turned on cylinders but it just slid forward.. any tips would be much appreciated.

creations-chat 2020-03-13 20:24:08 yes and then you see their blocky noob creations and realise it's jealousy 🙂
creations-chat 2020-03-13 20:24:12 that's people sadly
creations-chat 2020-03-13 23:01:34 I would agree with the comments about downvotes if it weren't for the fact that for example my mig-28 is accurate to the real plane made off the actual blueprints.. so if they're downvoting they don't like the plane not my build. Everyone warned me how toxic this server was I had hoped it was not true.
