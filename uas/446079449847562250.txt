help 2020-11-01 18:47:39 Ive had somebody copy one of my builds in a public server and post a video with his scuffed unfinished version..
help 2020-11-01 18:48:36 Can i atleast link the video and an image of my build?
help 2020-11-01 18:48:44 Thats the build..
help 2020-11-01 18:48:58 https://youtu.be/U1q_g5JAjdg
help 2020-11-01 18:49:12 I noticed he was copying halfway through..
help 2020-11-01 18:49:28 So i loaded q new build and blacklisted him..
help 2020-11-01 18:49:32 *a
help 2020-11-01 18:50:01 He kept on building even afterwards and tried to glitch into my blacklist..
help 2020-11-01 18:50:13 He eventually ended up with a scuffed version..
bug-reports 2020-11-04 14:44:16 My trap doors wont open when I click them..
bug-reports 2020-11-04 14:44:48 Also, the motor 2 tends to fling me randomly..
bug-reports 2020-11-04 15:13:56 No..
bug-reports 2020-11-04 15:14:56 It flung me so bad that i couldn't do anything besides look around then instantly die and have my build explode everywhere when it flings..
bug-reports 2020-11-04 15:16:01 I ended up fixing the build by replacing it with a normal motor..
bug-reports 2020-11-04 15:17:24 Well, it was attached to a cannon on my ship..
bug-reports 2020-11-04 15:17:39 I had the speed set to 2.1
bug-reports 2020-11-04 15:17:56 About 5 or 6 blocks long..
bug-reports 2020-11-04 15:18:13 A single motor..
bug-reports 2020-11-04 15:18:50 I've also had a problem recently where my suspension spasms all the time..
bug-reports 2020-11-04 15:19:17 And sometimes it flings me..
bug-reports 2020-11-04 15:19:33 I barely managed to get it to work on a truck..
bug-reports 2020-11-04 15:19:55 Which build?
bug-reports 2020-11-04 15:20:16 Ok..
bug-reports 2020-11-04 15:21:02 Since I dont have discord setup on my laptop I have to download the image to my Google drive, so hold on..
bug-reports 2020-11-04 15:24:57 Ok
bug-reports 2020-11-04 15:25:04 
bug-reports 2020-11-04 15:25:35 Those motors behind the suspension were from an older versiin to try to stop it..
bug-reports 2020-11-04 15:25:40 Version..
bug-reports 2020-11-04 15:26:05 And it drives but still violently bounces..
bug-reports 2020-11-04 15:26:10 Ive tried that..
bug-reports 2020-11-04 15:26:25 It made it worse..
bug-reports 2020-11-04 15:27:14 I just recently added more width to the wheel after testing everything..
bug-reports 2020-11-04 15:27:33 I even had help trying to fix it from my friends..
bug-reports 2020-11-04 15:27:56 I think ive got it the best i could..
bug-reports 2020-11-04 15:28:24 Like i said ive basically tried all i could..
bug-reports 2020-11-04 15:28:49 I spent an entire day fixing it..
bug-reports 2020-11-04 15:28:57 ...
bug-reports 2020-11-04 15:29:16 Why would you use jjsploit?
bug-reports 2020-11-04 15:29:39 Its unsafe, plus its almost made to get you detected..
bug-reports 2020-11-04 15:30:56 I used to mess around with an animation gui in the game and crawl through 1 block spaces..
bug-reports 2020-11-04 15:31:22 Lol
