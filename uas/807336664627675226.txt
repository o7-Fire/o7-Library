im pretty sure you meant A-10A and added the late instead of the A variant because gaijin added an earlier and later modification of the A-10A

creations-chat 2022-07-17 04:24:43 actually that plane crazy one is based on a real classified project but with a vertical stabilizer
creations-chat 2022-07-17 04:26:52 the biggest thing we know about It is the plane sideways upside down

alr good spotting mate
creations-chat 2022-10-26 21:25:42 <@747811503591129170> the MiG-23BN did not use missiles
creations-chat 2022-10-28 01:36:41 <@939716590683979907>
1. A requirement for stealth is also internal armament 
2. Why 3 intakes
creations-chat 2022-10-31 14:10:53 maintance guys:
creations-chat 2022-11-01 21:22:34 <@659716559153135617> the yak 38 has a high wing placement
creations-chat 2022-11-03 13:50:01 really depends on what the thrust vectoring gives
sukhoi aircraft used It for that thrust vectoring bs
the f22 used It for air superiority and dogfighting peformance
creations-chat 2022-11-03 13:53:00 so put a limiter on the thrust vectoring angle and you wont drain all the speed
creations-chat 2022-11-03 13:55:21 because a 0,6 seconds can make a difference
creations-chat 2022-11-03 14:13:33 that maintance on the wings tho

contest-chat 2022-11-06 17:43:42 1.74?
contest-chat 2022-11-06 17:45:06 meters arent like ft, you always include 2 decimals
contest-chat 2022-11-06 17:45:51 i said about stuff like this
contest-chat 2022-11-06 17:46:24 1.74/1.75 isnt rounded to 1.7
contest-chat 2022-11-06 17:47:25 4 cm makes a difference

creations-chat 2022-11-27 02:20:09 that is certainly the nose of all time
creations-chat 2022-11-30 21:52:01 <@942893388091498546> how do you expect an a10 to fight<:OmegaTroll:626841385118597152>
creations-chat 2022-11-30 21:55:01 and the worst turn rate of all time
creations-chat 2022-11-30 22:30:50 Did you ever research about the A-10? It is an attack aircraft made exclusively for attack missions. Wonder why It got a variety of armaments? These are air to surface ordinance, and missiles aren't made just to engage aircraft. Even though It can carry 4 Sidewinders to defend itself, It cannot merge with actual fighter aircraft and expect a chance of victory without being on it's tail instantly
creations-chat 2022-11-30 23:34:45 maybe helis or propellers
creations-chat 2022-12-02 12:11:04 <@611367022567358579> Why are there control surfaces inside the wings? Airbrakes?
creations-chat 2022-12-02 19:49:35 >takes a random fictional stealth airframe from google

creations-chat 2023-02-28 16:03:21 Maybe the Felon has a slight reduced RCS because of the format of the airframe and Russia took that as a opportunity to call It stealth
