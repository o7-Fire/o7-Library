creations-chat 2023-04-20 17:19:24 Stop telling them to fix the bot then
creations-chat 2023-07-09 13:08:20 These are the type of people who are the reason why this discord community is considered so toxic. Just gotta be an asshole to all the white name builders, just because they have no builder roles. How are they expected to get one of those roles if the entire server downvotes their genuinely good builds that are better than most non-whitenamed builds and full on abuses them?
