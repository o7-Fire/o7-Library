creations-chat 2019-12-20 02:53:36 Propellor blades are categorized with normal propellors, right? So there should be a dedicated water propellor blade that are categorized with water propellors

help 2020-06-01 19:03:47 Dunno if it was a recent update or what, but all of my 5x5 cylinders cars ride bumpy as hell now. This had recently started happening to my friend to. I took a closer look at the cylinders and they look like they are not round anymore, and only have maybe 13-17 sides. Why? What was wrong with cylinders beforehand? Why were they changed?
help 2020-06-01 20:12:41 But I would rather sacrifice a miniscule amount of performance for a nice, smooth ride quality than improve performance a tiny amount making my rear axle litterally smash itself into the upper wheel wells two times a second
help 2020-06-01 20:13:10 bro my AMC Javelin plays pingpong against the top of the wheel wells and the ground when I go full speed now
help 2020-06-01 20:13:35 literally not worth the performance improvement whatsoever
help 2020-06-01 20:13:52 I hope rickje sees this and reverts all cylinders back to what they were before

In one of these "Performance Improvement" Updates, the devs made cylinders have less sides and more blocky. Ride quality in any of my cars, and even barebones chassis is shit now. Really puts my triangulated 4 link live axle chassis to work absorbing all the bumps.

the-dump 2020-10-09 09:13:55 I see that the coyote is more expensive because of its dual vvti system along with its 4 valve design, but it's not really that way anymore
the-dump 2020-10-09 09:14:17 I will say however that there are some faults with the gen 3 coyote motors

creations-chat 2021-11-05 17:58:03 Very good point you make. Single color rich blacks are hard to make since its easy to make it turn into a blob, and if too dull looks like a dark gray. I wonder if PC2 will have new reflective block customization
creations-chat 2021-11-05 18:00:40 Yeah, currently it's like reddish/orangish black in some light. But <@!529716042113744906> foil and ice are pretty awful materials to use on large flat surfaces.
