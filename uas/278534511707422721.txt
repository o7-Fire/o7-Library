help 2022-03-08 23:04:16 i've overengineered the entire thing

help 2022-03-08 23:06:24 cna't go wrong
help 2022-03-08 23:06:33 do you have any tips on steering?
help 2022-03-08 23:06:43 i'm using two servos
help 2022-03-08 23:07:19 on each wheel
help 2022-03-08 23:07:29 i don't know the term for the type of turning

help 2022-03-09 13:18:50 nerd
help 2022-03-09 15:53:44 it shaked considerably more with just a single servo but that was before i added a few things, i'll change it back to one just to see a result
help 2022-03-09 15:55:46 the two servos were for added torque
help 2022-03-09 15:55:47 but yk
help 2022-03-09 15:55:50 can't go wrong
