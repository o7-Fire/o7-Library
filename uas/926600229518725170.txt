creations-chat 2022-07-02 05:08:35 Why do people go crazy over one or two details
creations-chat 2022-07-02 17:37:17 I agree
creations-chat 2022-07-03 18:46:17 One block wide planes are fine, it‚Äôs better than looking chonky
creations-chat 2022-07-17 07:15:16 Fard
creations-chat 2022-07-18 08:51:52 Bro why are you so harsh, you expect 1:1 realism on a lego game. And if you are so good make his plane but better.

creations-chat 2022-07-18 09:00:06 Man‚Äôs saying I‚Äôm not criticizing his plane but I am üíÄ
creations-chat 2022-07-18 09:04:20 Firstly, his pile of blocks is not bad lol, along with the fact that camera lock isn‚Äôt reliable, so there will be *slight* differences from its real world counterpart
creations-chat 2022-07-18 09:07:03 You were commenting on his build, if that was true I might as well slapped you in the face and said ‚Äúno offense to you, I am not slapping you‚Äù
creations-chat 2022-07-18 09:10:10 The point of the conversation now is that you can‚Äôt say you didn‚Äôt do something in the same sentence you said you did something. End conversation
creations-chat 2022-07-18 09:15:31 The point was that if you can‚Äôt build better you shouldn‚Äôt criticize other peoples builds, especially if you work in a similar craft to them.
creations-chat 2022-07-18 09:18:54 Harassment and criticism are different things, now go do something instead of waiting for time to run out
creations-chat 2022-07-18 09:22:38 Not really, I haven‚Äôt been ranked yet although I have a 2400 block battle carrier sitting in my saves file. Creations blacklist is irrelevant for this argument
creations-chat 2022-07-18 09:27:53 I mean should a noob be criticizing a mediocre player of all the noob can build is a pile of blocks. Or should a spaceship designer criticize a tank designers work if All he can build is suspension free treads for his launch platform. Criticism can be warranted
