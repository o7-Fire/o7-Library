plane-crazy 2020-06-24 05:34:23 That'd be good for things like rockets that need to get speed

plane-crazy 2020-05-23 04:38:09 pvp so that the plane can blow up and go into the towers
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 04:37:51 *builds in 2001*
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 04:37:08 An airliner and 2 towers in the same build
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 04:36:51 for pvp
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 04:36:47 I just got a building idea
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 04:36:41 .
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 04:36:37 bruh
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 04:36:22 not even decent
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 04:36:18 Its pathetic how long it took me to get decent at building
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 04:36:07 bruh
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 04:35:41 my exscuse of a bomber has a back gun that rotates
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 04:35:23 nvm, i have it on one i think
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 04:35:13 I dont think I have any steerable guns on any of my planes
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 04:34:18 lmao
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 04:34:14 make that the b-2 without computers helping it fly
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 04:33:36 Your A-10 is literally as complicated as a real life b-2 bomber
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 04:33:18 jeez
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 04:32:31 how do you need like 14 just to steer the plane lmao
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 04:32:23 my reaction was just: why
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 04:31:26 l0l
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 04:31:09 they are the bombs
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 04:31:06 My planes on my carrier dont need bombs
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 04:30:57 I count it
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 04:30:45 The planes dont have bombs, and i do count it if they had to detonate bombs
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 04:30:22 arrows are for steering the planes
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 04:30:17 wasd is steering the ship
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 04:30:11 keypad 1 through 8 are for releasing aircraft
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 04:30:01 1 through 8 are explosions for the kamikaze planes
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 04:29:51 z through / are cameras
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 04:29:36 And I thought my aircraft carrier had lots of keyblinds
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 04:29:21 Yikes
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 04:28:31 damn
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 04:28:29 The thing is as complicated as a real life b-2
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 04:27:59 yikes why so many
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 04:27:50 thats about it
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 04:27:46 The only thing I would add is a torp.
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 04:26:41 But usually I dont
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 04:26:38 I honestly dont care if I use helium blocks as long as it looks good
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 04:26:28 I mean,
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 04:26:27 eh
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 04:25:48 You could possibly use helium
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 04:25:24 Is there any room for jets or propellers on the inside of it?
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 04:24:41 the jet engines look like crap on the tutorial one
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 04:24:34 Its definately not i just looked at the tutorial a-10
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 04:24:24 ok nvm its not
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 04:23:29 Thats not the tutorial one im guessing right?
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 04:22:24 The only thing I could think of that wouldnt look that akward is maybe a torpedo
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 04:21:55 Basically
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 04:21:31 How do they work tho are there like saved audios that you can choose from? or is it like music ID's.
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 04:21:07 same dude
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 04:20:46 My cat just fell lmao
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 04:20:42 bruh
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 04:20:10 Maybe a torpedo? idk
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 04:20:04 But yeah besides that I cant think of anything else
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 04:19:55 True.
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 04:19:45 If you wanna snipe ground targets its good
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 04:19:32 Its good for pvp though. I put it on my fighter and made one witha nd without
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 04:19:16 Yeah, true.
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 04:18:29 instead of just regular ones in the pvp slot
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 04:18:11 You could add guided missiles to it
plane-crazy 2020-05-12 05:01:34 Yeah and I ended uo getting harrassed for it which is nice
plane-crazy 2020-05-12 04:57:00 wow ok. you guys totally werent harassing and insulting me earlier in groups <@!500443537389912074>
