Motor 2 Locks
[GAMEPLAY]

[DESCRIPTION]
Add a lock configuration to Motor 2. Motor 2s can freak out when under certain circumstances on complex builds, but when using normal motors they lock and don't freak out. Motor2 doesn't have this configurable option, and using normal motors can't give you precise placements between two different angles/movements. For example: Building a complex Transformer vehicle, motor2 is great for transforming between the two forms, but they freak out. Normal motors are great for keeping everything in place but the form isn't kept correctly. Please consider adding a lock configuration to Motor2.

Example link of Motor2s without locks freaking out:
