the-dump 2022-07-05 00:35:46 Minions 2 is the greatest film ever

 The movie Minions, Rise of Gru, is unequivocally the greatest film of the decade, for now I question whether I, and humanity as a species, are worthy of this life changing masterpiece. Immaculate, extravagant, and brilliant are nowhere near enough to describe this film.   This movie was truly encompassing of all emotions, along with profoundly polished animation, near flawless lip-syncing, and subtle and powerful moments of comedy. The scene where the minions comply with a request for peanuts by giving not the bag, but a single peanut, made the theater roar with applause, and led to a standing ovation in the middle of the film. In fact, that scene was a subtle criticism of the current economic "situation" regarding inflation, or shrinkflation, to be more accurate. However, the movie also includes more wholesome scenes, such as when the Minions (very graciously) almost crash an airplane with live passengers into an air traffic control tower.   My first time watching the film, I ended up shaking, crying, and falling over, while the moviegoers around me began chanting pro-gru chants. When I woke up, I ascended to the astral plane and witnessed millions of human lives being saved because of this masterpiece of a film. Thousands of people fell to their knees at various grocery outlets and fast food chains as applause drowned out the ending credits. "Minions: The Rise of Gru" defines the expansiveness of what we as a civilization can achieve if we dedicate ourselves wholeheartedly to our craftz.

creations-chat 2022-12-07 14:44:26 i have had a lot of friends that play pc in the past and probably have more necessary motorlock and angle lock in their planes than you have on your #1 most motorlocked plane and they make namnam planes
