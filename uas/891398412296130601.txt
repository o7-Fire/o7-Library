The Tale of buzz4881 (891398412296130601)
bug-reports 2022-07-02 18:00:27 Seats are slightly off balance, meaning any rocket that has one seat at the top will drift
bug-reports 2022-07-02 18:04:00 wtf is a stabiliser
bug-reports 2022-07-02 18:09:18 i have rocketry down to an art form. Aka, i swish randomly and think it looks good but it doesn't.
bug-reports 2022-07-02 18:09:34 its only a really slight drift
bug-reports 2022-07-02 18:10:15 Fins, i have those
bug-reports 2022-07-02 18:10:46 oh
bug-reports 2022-07-02 18:10:58 is that why only the second stage had the drift
bug-reports 2022-07-02 18:11:09 because the stage with the fins on it disconnected
bug-reports 2022-07-02 18:12:33 i mean i can make a multi stage rocket so thats something right?
bug-reports 2022-07-02 18:12:44 first stage, second stage, and pod with the parachute
bug-reports 2022-07-02 18:14:14 there is a miniscule ammount of drift on the first stage
bug-reports 2022-07-02 18:15:02 We should move this to help chat
bug-reports 2022-07-02 18:19:45 ok fins on the second stage are just making it drift more
