help 2022-05-31 02:37:50 can anyone help me build the front to my aircraft carrier
help 2022-05-31 02:37:57 my brain hurts from it
creations-chat 2022-06-01 18:30:00 looks great
creations-chat 2022-06-01 18:33:13 thats not really changing it
creations-chat 2022-06-01 18:35:26 again, that is not changing it.
creations-chat 2022-06-01 18:38:20 if you delete all the blocks you have not changed anything because there is nothing left to change
creations-chat 2022-06-01 18:40:52 I he places blocks that is creating something new instead of fixing something old. you would again yell at him if he made something new because you don't like good builds.
creations-chat 2022-06-01 18:42:55 yes, that is how this game works.

and you <@765318482753224704> do not know how this game works
creations-chat 2022-06-01 18:49:34 if you replace a block with a wedge when the block is the only thing on the plot, then you are changing the build. if you replace the block with a wedge but there is other stuff on the plot then you are replacing the block. idk if you have the mental stability to understand this so if you want I could help you.

<@625339333880315935> are you a broken record?
creations-chat 2022-06-01 18:54:10 looks good, try to make the fins look like the thing irl, but otherwise the build looks great!
