creations-chat 2021-07-18 23:32:07 well, u see there is a minor problem with doing that, it is motor lock
creations-chat 2021-07-19 00:34:14 the overcomplicated engines at the back, they use 8 parachutes.... each

creations-chat 2021-12-05 14:49:51 this is how it should look
creations-chat 2022-02-18 11:53:00 ive not finished the car yet (its more of a bed i can sit the engine on)
creations-chat 2022-02-18 18:51:58 im making an antarctic snow cruiser and im wondering, should i move the wheels around a bit
creations-chat 2022-02-18 18:54:40 i now realise i definately need to
creations-chat 2022-02-18 19:02:21 yeah im moving them alot closer i just need to figure out how far i need to move them on the front to make it thinner

creations-chat 2022-02-26 12:33:43 this is a tyre and i need to stop it front getting those strange ridges whenever i lock it, i know i happens from the the cylinders and half blocks from overlapping but idk if theres a way around it
creations-chat 2022-02-26 12:36:47 it just overlaps so thats my issue, is there a way around it?
creations-chat 2022-02-26 16:17:15 i dont know how to feel about this, it might be too over the top
creations-chat 2022-02-26 16:22:02 l a r g e
creations-chat 2022-02-26 16:25:49 why do i want to put like 8 of these together (if you noticed the colour difference on one of the wheels i fixed it)
creations-chat 2022-03-04 17:27:27 im trying to make what is sort of close to this bus but just changed a bit, is there any way i could make the front better (i am working on fixing the annoying texts running off the front of it)
creations-chat 2022-03-04 17:33:00 now to redo the locking so theres no exposed motorlock ðŸ˜Ž
creations-chat 2022-03-04 22:30:28 this is how much ive managed to reduce the lock on this, does it look any better? also idk how to fix that annoying paint issue

creations-chat 2022-06-07 15:42:42 does anyone know a way of fixing this but still keep a good cone shape
creations-chat 2022-06-07 16:42:00 the jagged bits
creations-chat 2022-06-07 19:11:00 afterburner (unfinished)
creations-chat 2022-06-07 19:13:05 it cant actually move (as of right now). im trying to make it so that it can move which is the hardest thing ive ever tried to do, im gonna fill in the gaps if i cant get it to work how an afterburner should
creations-chat 2022-06-07 19:21:26 thats really accurate
creations-chat 2022-06-07 20:11:59 who is sebee
creations-chat 2022-06-07 21:00:47 afterburner but **cone**
creations-chat 2022-06-07 21:07:22 i have no idea how to make a decent flame
creations-chat 2022-06-07 21:09:33 alright, i was originally planning to put on an f16
creations-chat 2022-06-08 17:22:32 ive decided to make another one and put it on a eurofighter typhoon (this could take a while)
creations-chat 2022-06-08 19:16:17 what plane should i put this on
creations-chat 2022-06-08 19:18:21 yeah ill have to make do with what ive got left
creations-chat 2022-06-08 19:24:11 it wasnt built for being the lightest thing in the world and i can always just put so many thrusters my ears will want to fall off so that it will even take off, if i did a mig and put it at the front of it then its difficult to cover up the bottom of the motors where as if i put it as an afterburner i could easily just use the motors as a detail for the rest of the design, i could do an f35 ***paragraph***
creations-chat 2022-06-08 19:29:00 great idea
creations-chat 2022-06-08 19:33:05 i could make a really good burnt looking paintjob on the thing that i made i cant remember the name of the engine thing
creations-chat 2022-06-08 21:05:05 i did it
creations-chat 2022-06-08 21:09:31 its in creations
creations-chat 2022-06-08 21:25:26 im gonna put it on an f35 or an f16, idk which one yet
