creations-chat 2020-11-27 11:46:00 i tried to make it as clean as possible
i hid some propeller blades that acted like downforce inside the place where the engine is supposed to be

thats my building style so ye
creations-chat 2020-11-27 11:49:13 its hard to make the exterior very clean and i had to think for a couple of minutes just to find a way to add downforce to it while maintaining the neatness of the exterior

creations-chat 2020-11-27 12:03:30 I stated it there:
> P.S. This is not meant to be an exact replica.
creations-chat 2020-11-27 12:05:36 The reason why I put "P.S. This is not meant to be an exact replica." was because I thought:
"hmm, someone for sure will downvote because of the scale but i purposely didnt make the scale perfect, so lemme add that in"
creations-chat 2020-11-27 12:07:50 nah just say it
i rather learn from others than stick with the issues my rocket/droneship has while being unaware
creations-chat 2020-11-27 12:10:10 oh for that i purposely made it fixed since its meant to work like the f9r dev
pls dont take this as an "excuse". i just purposely did it, but i will probably look more into that in the future. thanks <:ElonApprove:589130525315301380>
creations-chat 2020-11-27 12:13:03 your work is good and i appreciate your effort.
pls dont take this personally, but i dont rlly like the look of the wings/propeller blades being exposed outside
creations-chat 2020-11-27 12:16:29 i think i'll stick with the "hidden downforce"
creations-chat 2020-11-27 12:18:22 and i'm awfully sorry if i, in any way, hurt your feelings after rejecting your suggestion.

the-dump 2020-12-02 18:42:08 i have a tip
when u see the toilet
you need to become friends with it
then it will help you escape through the pooping process because 1 = 2 since 1+1=2 so we can conclude that i am in the illuminati
the-dump 2020-12-02 18:42:26 ok i need sleep
the-dump 2020-12-02 18:42:28 a lot of sleep
the-dump 2020-12-02 18:43:43 you need to try and eat the toilet bowl but watch out because theres many dangerous people inside the toilet like mr swasher and washy wishy
the-dump 2020-12-02 18:46:02 i heard mr swasher and washy wishy had a baby called balabala and he is very strong
he can lift up one person with one toilet bowl
so watch out for balabala because he can fight the bowl until it goes to the super cup world champion inside kfc
the-dump 2020-12-02 18:46:40 ok im gonna actually sleep my brain is in "no effort to think" mode
