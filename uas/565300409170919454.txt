creations-chat 2020-10-20 12:57:42 wait did they just post the ratte? at creations, the ratte tank
creations-chat 2020-10-20 13:03:46 i just posted my USS Avocet
creations-chat 2020-10-20 13:05:49 Also i have been working on USS parrott (clemson class DD) but i have noticed the bow is TOO SHORT, extreemely short, and i will have to re-do the bow but im lazy rn
creations-chat 2020-10-20 13:07:11 Uh thats easy, just stack wedges but 1 block more forward on top or do 2 in same spot and then 1 block more, depends on how much it has to advance
creations-chat 2020-10-20 13:08:15 also its bcuz of my quality is low, you cant see the shadows, also im talking about the side lol, stacking wedges, as you can see i did that for the sides (Pic with good quality so yo ucan see no smoothness now)
creations-chat 2020-10-20 13:09:50 also i have been working on a extremely funny supermarine spitfire (Sliding cockpit, realistic control panels with motors, and a balalst block to give it weight)
creations-chat 2020-10-20 13:10:51 thats supermarine spitfire MK IX, it had 4 prop
creations-chat 2020-10-20 13:12:14 Heres a vid of it after started (bcuz it has motor locking, showing the propeller blurr, and the tail movement, and cockpit sliding)
creations-chat 2020-10-20 13:13:18 FORGOT TO DO DASHBOARD OOPS https://streamable.com/p1844z also how do you post 2 pics in a single chat
creations-chat 2020-10-20 13:15:11 the blur looks STUPID bcuz of the lag (Also whats the DAMN purpose of not powered disconnectors, i mean i tried to see if it was automatic disconnection by crashing and hitting itself into something but no

bot-central 2020-10-20 18:29:37 with 4 lucky people managed to join
creations-chat 2020-10-20 21:59:01 cars are stupid, planes are better
creations-chat 2020-10-20 22:00:03 reason: planes are extremely COOL, because they are inspired by birds, and birds are EXTREMELY COOL (but when a plane kills a bird that plane gets uncool rank)
creations-chat 2020-10-20 22:01:07 no, you mean wagens, stupid idiot, also landsailing, landsailing and wagens weren't really cars, well they we're called cars, but thats because car goes to carriage, wich is also another name for wagen, and the real name is automobile (MOVES BY ITSELF, and automobiles didnt exist before planes we're a concept)
creations-chat 2020-10-20 22:02:14 landsailing and wagens weren't really cars, well they we're called cars, but thats because car goes to carriage, wich is also another name for wagen, and the real name is automobile (MOVES BY ITSELF, and automobiles didnt exist before planes we're a concept)
creations-chat 2020-10-20 22:03:37 i talk about the concept, planes we're imagined even in 1500, bruh lol, also the first submarine 1771 and the first naval submarine with torpedoes 1890, the first blimp 1860, the first train 1820
creations-chat 2020-10-20 22:04:44 also bro, with concept i dont mean WHEN DID THEY TRY TO BUILD THEM, and YEAH WE GOT CARS, CAR = CARRIAGE, and the real name of the ones you talk about (NOWADAYS ENGINE VEHICLES) Is automobile = wich means automatic movement, because of engines.
creations-chat 2020-10-20 22:05:48 car = carriage = horse powered wheeled vehicles
concept of a vehicle = when was it first imagined, for example planes: 1500s
automovile = automatic movement vehicle (wich is what we got nowadays AND GOT INVENTED IN 1885) 
also i NEVER SAID planes we're made before cars, read rightly
AND IM SAYING PLANES WE'RE IMAGINED, NOT BUILT, IMAGINED IN 1500S, I NEVER SAID THEY WE'RE BUILT IN 1500S, I SAID IMAGINED, THINKED ABOUT IF IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE, THINKED OF THE IDEA OF A FLYING MACHINE
creations-chat 2020-10-20 22:06:49 AND IM SAYING PLANES WE'RE IMAGINED, NOT BUILT, IMAGINED IN 1500S, I NEVER SAID THEY WE'RE BUILT IN 1500S, I SAID IMAGINED, THINKED ABOUT IF IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE, THINKED OF THE IDEA OF A FLYING MACHINE,
creations-chat 2020-10-20 22:07:50 also i already knew that, havent got anything from internet rn
creations-chat 2020-10-20 22:08:51 game, we never said planes we're made before cars, we said planes we're touhg of before engined horseless vehicles
creations-chat 2020-10-20 22:09:56 viratech, i said i havent googled anything rn, i didnt say i never googled those info and like i magically knew. also they we're actually started being imagined in 1500s, google about when we're planes first imagined
creations-chat 2020-10-20 22:11:31 GODDAMN GOOGLE IS STUPID, IM GOOGLED WHEN DID PLANES WE'RE FIRST IMAGINED AND MORE DIFFERENT WAYS OF THE SAME QUESTION AND KEEPS SAYING WRIGHT FLYERS MADE THE FIRST PLANE, BUT IM NOT ASKING WHEN WE'RE PLANES FIRST MADE, IM GOOGLING WHEN WAS IT FIRST IMAGINED LMAO
creations-chat 2020-10-20 22:12:34 DONE FINALLY FOUND THE INFO, leonardo davinci did the FIRST STUDIES of the possibility of making planes, and even tough about them before that*, in 1480 (also technically yes he was copying how birds looked like)
creations-chat 2020-10-20 22:13:54 also game, admit you we're wrong on thinking i was saying planes was made before cars, because i said when planes were first imagined, not made.
creations-chat 2020-10-20 22:14:58 and ill stop giving you defined explanations of my point and how you're wrong and how i didnt say planes we're made before cars and how i actually said how flying machines (aircraft, blimp) we're firstly imagined even before they imagined the idea of horseless carriages that could move by theirselves (what we know as nowadays, AUTOMOBILES, carriages that move by theirselves, without horses)
creations-chat 2020-10-20 22:16:12 also nice locomotive engine  bruh thats actually extremely realistic, i once made a system based on how train systems worked, to make flapping wings that didnt need 2 keys but just holding a key. (saddly it wasnt very effective by how airfoils work in plane crazy [Speed doesnt matter when you talk about airfoil flapping])
creations-chat 2020-10-20 22:17:14 ok but look at my supercool supremarkine spriteoffer https://streamable.com/c6rrfl
creations-chat 2020-10-20 22:19:21 also the mispell was in purpose, i just wanted to make it sound funny, also  i tough first engine was 1820 scremming also supremarkine spriteoffer evolved to supermarine spitfire MK IX https://streamable.com/m6bz84 WAIT OOPS THIS IS OUTDATED I DIDNT FIX THE TAIL PROBLEM YET
creations-chat 2020-10-20 22:20:40 i literally tried getting the fps unlocker but it doesnt work, i did a lot of stuff but no it says its running and all but i dont get the icon of the thing when playing roblox, and fps do not change

creations-chat 2020-10-21 00:44:09 Guys what do you think about my spitfire, just posted it on creations, its the 3rd time i post it because i updated it 4 times.

the-dump 2020-12-02 20:52:20 whitelist sucks
the-dump 2020-12-02 20:52:24 whitelist
the-dump 2020-12-02 20:52:33 add whitelist
the-dump 2020-12-02 20:52:43 i
the-dump 2020-12-02 20:52:47 had an idea of a whitelist
the-dump 2020-12-02 20:52:52 that is NOTHING RELATED TO BUILDING WHITELIST
the-dump 2020-12-02 20:52:58 but it also could be called pvp blacklist
the-dump 2020-12-02 20:53:18 my idea was a blacklist/whitelist that makes you not able to damage the player blacklisted/whitelisted meanwhile they also cant damage you, in PVP
the-dump 2020-12-02 20:53:25 i already shared it at
the-dump 2020-12-02 20:53:28 suggestions
the-dump 2020-12-02 20:53:37 but the fucking ppl said whitelist wont be added blah blah
the-dump 2020-12-02 20:53:43 and me be like: bruh its not building whitelist its pvp whitelist
the-dump 2020-12-02 20:53:55 also them: *gives a chat on why building whitelist isnt possible*
bot-central 2020-12-03 15:54:41 ?shelp
bot-central 2020-12-03 15:59:30 uh my friend wanted it
bot-central 2020-12-03 15:59:50 he really needs those (not for a blimp or hot air balloon, maybe to enhance sinking mechanisms)
bot-central 2020-12-03 16:00:00 its the simplest idea i've got in mind
bot-central 2020-12-03 16:00:05 i hope its not impossible to add
bot-central 2020-12-03 16:00:13 ill ask why he needs em
bot-central 2020-12-03 16:00:42 not really
bot-central 2020-12-03 16:00:47 he doesnt make blimps or any of that shit
bot-central 2020-12-03 16:00:51 he makes boats
bot-central 2020-12-03 16:00:59 im sure its related to sinking mechanisms
bot-central 2020-12-03 16:01:05 Oh
bot-central 2020-12-03 16:01:15 so he didnt have to spam
bot-central 2020-12-03 16:01:17 helium everywhere
bot-central 2020-12-03 16:01:21 for automatic self destruct
bot-central 2020-12-03 16:01:30 thats what he said not sure what it means
bot-central 2020-12-03 16:02:24 ooh
bot-central 2020-12-03 16:02:28 so his reasons for helium tanks
bot-central 2020-12-03 16:02:37 is that he has a key to make ballast stop going up
bot-central 2020-12-03 16:02:40 when the ship self destructs
bot-central 2020-12-03 16:03:10 so it can sink automatically and not float up by the loss of weight bc hes gonna need helium to stabilize his ship as its too heavy and ballast tanks stabilize it but sink it farther and farther
bot-central 2020-12-03 16:03:33 so afterall its not because hes a bad builder
bot-central 2020-12-03 16:03:43 its because he actually needs them and theres something impossible to do without them
