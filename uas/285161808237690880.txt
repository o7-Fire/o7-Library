help 2020-02-06 17:20:37 I don't want to use rockets.
help 2020-02-06 17:22:06 Alright.
help 2020-02-06 17:26:05 I'll probably just search a conveyor driver.
help 2020-02-06 17:26:08 drive*
help 2020-02-06 17:27:52 I really haven't built anything advanced, but what's your progress so far?
help 2020-02-06 17:28:23 The AT-ST
help 2020-02-06 17:28:59 Hm.
help 2020-02-06 17:29:24 I would mainly start with the "skeleton" of the building, so like the "bones" of the legs, etc.
help 2020-02-06 18:02:27 I think I made the conveyor drive wrong.
help 2020-02-06 18:02:30 It's not working.
help 2020-02-06 18:06:31 Oop.
help 2020-02-06 18:06:34 It worked.
help 2020-02-06 18:09:46 Though, it doesn't spin.
help 2020-02-06 18:30:57 Hm.

bug-reports 2020-02-12 00:36:17 My friend is making a build and sometimes his pistons won't work.
bug-reports 2020-02-12 00:36:25 Help is appreciated.
bug-reports 2020-02-12 00:36:46 I think a video might help.
bug-reports 2020-02-12 00:37:17 I'll try explaining actually.
bug-reports 2020-02-12 00:37:38 So, he uses the button to activate the pistons to rise the height, but they're not working.
bug-reports 2020-02-12 00:37:55 At first it works, but then later it doesn't.
bug-reports 2020-02-12 00:38:04 *He's making a beyblade, by the way.*
bug-reports 2020-02-12 00:39:55 Do you need a video?
bug-reports 2020-02-12 00:41:11 His other builds are good, but this one's pistons doesn't work.
bug-reports 2020-02-12 01:14:06 My friend fixed it.
help 2020-03-03 00:42:32 How do I make a motor make something spin?

help 2020-03-03 00:42:59 Alright
help 2020-03-03 00:42:59 
help 2020-03-03 00:43:14 So, the red part moves which I don't want it to when I use that motor that's circled in blue
help 2020-03-03 00:43:17 it's a wheel
help 2020-03-03 00:43:27 Do I need to add more weight to the red part?
help 2020-03-03 00:43:53 Make the wheel move
help 2020-03-03 00:44:08 
help 2020-03-03 00:44:09 Front side
help 2020-03-03 00:46:00 Well
help 2020-03-03 00:46:03 Not spin
help 2020-03-03 00:46:21 But make the wheel turn to where the "rims" are on the ground
help 2020-03-03 00:46:57 Like a BTF Delorean
help 2020-03-03 00:54:14 Do I need to give a better example?
help 2020-03-03 00:54:49 
help 2020-03-03 00:54:53 I want the wheel to face down like that
help 2020-03-03 00:54:58 How would I do that?
help 2020-03-03 00:55:08 I've done it before but I can't seem to find out how I did it.
help 2020-03-03 00:56:30 I know
help 2020-03-03 00:56:34 I am using a motor
help 2020-03-03 00:56:55 
help 2020-03-03 00:57:00 I think it's that red motor
help 2020-03-03 00:57:23 The red motor is for steering, the blue for the throttle, and the black for the wheel moving
help 2020-03-03 00:57:57 I think I found a solution
help 2020-03-03 00:58:04 Or I'm just making it worse
help 2020-03-03 00:58:44 Would I put it above the suspension?

help 2020-03-03 01:41:00 to*
help 2020-03-03 01:44:32 
help 2020-03-03 01:44:38 Would I put the motor on the other side?
