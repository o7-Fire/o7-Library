plane-crazy 2020-07-02 16:09:37 I just eliminate torque entirely by using engines on the rotors
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 23:48:05 Yo anyone else got a glitch where theyâ€™re stuck in their own plot?
plane-crazy 2020-06-21 02:32:01 But spelling just isnâ€™t for everyone apparently
plane-crazy 2020-06-21 02:31:47 Yeah he did
plane-crazy 2020-06-21 02:31:34 Billed
plane-crazy 2020-06-21 02:29:57 Rotat e
plane-crazy 2020-06-21 02:29:48 Ah yes
plane-crazy 2020-05-30 00:29:46 yes
plane-crazy 2020-05-30 00:25:59 so I guess I could make it faster
plane-crazy 2020-05-30 00:25:47 It can take off at around 150 studs per second with helium
plane-crazy 2020-05-30 00:25:27 oh right
plane-crazy 2020-05-30 00:24:58 oh well the problem is just weight
plane-crazy 2020-05-30 00:24:41 I could use my 737 or something
plane-crazy 2020-05-30 00:24:31 oh well
plane-crazy 2020-05-30 00:24:27 there goes my idea to use the 747 :/
plane-crazy 2020-05-30 00:24:15 k
plane-crazy 2020-05-30 00:23:15 If you're applying for a rank you can't use helium in your plane, right?
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 18:19:18 a320 with no outlines ðŸ˜³
plane-crazy 2020-05-18 12:44:37 Yeah henkku dead

plane-crazy 2020-05-18 12:42:19 Oof
plane-crazy 2020-05-18 12:42:01 When was that?
plane-crazy 2020-05-18 12:41:56 Oh
plane-crazy 2020-05-18 12:41:45 There was a contest?
plane-crazy 2020-05-18 12:41:07 Oh shit someone already posted this didnâ€™t they
plane-crazy 2020-05-18 12:39:44 A (very rough) concept for a new map
