creations-chat 2019-02-07 21:42:03 also this sr71. it looks dumb but since it uses magnets to propel itself it kinda has to. also i created the magnet technique a while ago so if someone else uses the same, nice
creations-chat 2019-02-07 22:02:24 This massive aircraft carrier. i deleted it for space so idk the block count. it was 2 peices.
creations-chat 2019-02-27 22:35:50 This is my HE-111, i thought i could get the rank "Crazy engineer". It says make a 100 block rocket, this is 791. Also it says using one super rocket engine, i have none. Its completely powered using motors and propellors.

creations-chat 2019-02-27 23:36:46 Since i was an over-achiever and my large plane didn't fit qualifications, i made a new plane, powered with one super rocket engine.
