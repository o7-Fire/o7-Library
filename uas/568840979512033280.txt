The Tale of neopolitangames (568840979512033280)
creations-chat 2020-07-03 08:51:38 I have a vid of the creation I just shared somewhere on my phone, if I can figure out how to share it on discord. The thing can MOVE!
creations-chat 2020-07-03 08:52:10 I've seen faster creations, but nothing that takes off as fast as mine.
creations-chat 2020-07-03 08:53:54 Holy shite
creations-chat 2020-07-03 08:54:08 But is that on takeoff, or later?
creations-chat 2020-07-03 08:56:00 My creation goes from literally nothing to 600 in less than a second upon takeoff. Course, that's after I spool up the jets and ignite the rockets, they take forever to reach that speed, but once it actually starts moving, it's gone. I tried remote control on it originally, but it's so fast the game cant follow it
creations-chat 2020-07-03 08:56:49 Once it flies for a bit it slows to between 300 and 400, and the tail end shakes a lot, but it's pretty fast
creations-chat 2020-07-03 08:57:55 And it's decently controllable. Can even glide if I turn the engines off; in fact, it's pretty sluggish to respond to pitch controls, and levels out automatically as though it's got a gyro
creations-chat 2020-07-03 08:59:31 I glided (is that the right word?) For almost half an hour one time, never turned, never changed pitch, just stayed straight and level. Was going about 30 speed the whole time, so didnt get tons of distance, but still got so far I couldnt see anything but the creation, the sky, and the void.
creations-chat 2020-07-03 09:00:01 Then my game crashed cause someone loaded in a massive creation with tons if fold points
creations-chat 2020-07-03 09:42:24 Here, I uploaded my creation on youtube https://youtu.be/KdA6m20etao
creations-chat 2020-07-03 09:45:25 What's with all the downvotes?
creations-chat 2020-07-05 07:31:28 An update: my creation is terrible as a combat vehicle. Too much tail shake, which I still havent figured out what its caused by or how to fix it
