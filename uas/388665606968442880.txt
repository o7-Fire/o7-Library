creations-chat 2020-11-16 13:27:12 It makes me think tho, if the Philippines or any 3rd world country was a naval super power, what would their warship designs be like?

creations-chat 2021-01-19 03:20:31 Anyone have tips for camo? I'm gonna make a 100k Camo for Admiral Prince
creations-chat 2021-01-19 04:19:52 Trenches were ineffective for an obvious reason, Germany Fast
creations-chat 2021-01-19 04:24:07 It's hard to make things sound genuine with text but, I respect your opinion, and understandable that you don't like the stripes on the side, I really felt obligated to make that skin because 100K is a great achievement. Also, those screenshots were taken by me
creations-chat 2021-01-19 04:45:49 What score do I need to use in order to make the calculations for the designer rank? Is it from total creation score? Or from a singular creation?
creations-chat 2021-01-19 04:49:04 Which singular creation tho? Like, your best creation? Or.

creations-chat 2021-01-24 12:23:15 Needs some work, that camo is trippy as hell tho (In a good way), but it might need to have a consistent color
