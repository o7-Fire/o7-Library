creations-chat 2021-01-15 18:23:11 yeah, and the pixels are too large to be a block
creations-chat 2021-01-15 18:25:12 yeah, why are the pixels diagonal lmao, it also doesn't account for the camera distortion
creations-chat 2021-01-15 18:28:36 you edited the picture on so poorly, you didn't account for the pixel size and the camera distortion, also what are those giant grey lines on the top and bottom
creations-chat 2021-01-15 18:32:30 a lot of people here have functioning eyeballs, even with glasses thicker than the bottom of glass bottles
creations-chat 2021-01-15 18:34:31 i said __a lot__, not everyone lmao

creations-chat 2021-01-15 18:38:00 yeah, i mean pixel size alone had given it away, there's no way, that thing that close to the ground hid enough motor lock to motor lock a bunch of half wedges into 1/4th blocks to make a resolution that small, ok i need a break
creations-chat 2021-01-15 18:41:16 that along with the camera distortion, look at the left side of the plot, then look at the left side of the pixel art
creations-chat 2021-01-15 18:43:18 i feel like i just went full on debunk mode
creations-chat 2021-01-15 18:45:20 i learned how to motor lock literally from espionage, although, took a year after i joined for me to start the ||spying||
creations-chat 2021-01-15 18:55:29 should i updated this so that it is more detailed and actually has the correct 7 barrels and not 8
creations-chat 2021-01-15 18:57:33 btw i made it just so that i can flex it on <@!680276915776782340> :3
piston lock is superior to motor lock in my honest opinion
creations-chat 2021-01-15 19:01:35 piston lock moves it down less than 1/10th of a block which makes it even more helpful :3

creations-chat 2021-02-09 23:21:50 cause the kind i use is pull not push, i tried using push, but that's how i discovered pull, when pull was still a thing, ironically, the death of pull is what was able to create push <@!658140951273013248>
