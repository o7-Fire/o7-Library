creations-chat 2021-10-20 12:51:09 Exactly its symmetrical either way as long as it has the same thing on each end its symmetrical am I wrong? If it was 5 barrels lets say for easier convo and had 2 on one side and 3 on the other that would be asymmetrical take 5 barrels again perhaps and put the 3rd one in the middle so you have 2 on one side 2 on the other whilst a middle hence the 3rd one this was poorly explained cause i didnt have a coffee but it will do
