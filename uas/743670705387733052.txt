creations-chat 2021-12-03 22:12:38 ok, i looked it up and the turrets are a lighter shade of gray so that should add some variation

creations-chat 2021-12-04 18:38:13 ik the color is bland rn but how does the actual build look, also its missing all secondary guns and smaller details because its still a wip
creations-chat 2021-12-04 18:41:58 the antenna parts or the actual tower itself
creations-chat 2021-12-04 18:44:05 do you think moving the bridge up 1 or 2 blocks would help it look better, i think i did build the bride too low because from the front you can even see it behind the turrets
creations-chat 2021-12-04 18:46:15 barbettes?? sorry im not really that good with ship stuff
creations-chat 2021-12-04 18:48:28 ah alright, so i should move the turret down 1 block?
creations-chat 2021-12-04 18:50:54 ok thanks, should i do anything to the conning tower or would i be better off just leaving it be
creations-chat 2021-12-04 18:59:12 <@!527653676022628353> are the barbettes better now? i lowered the front one by half a block and the back one by 1 block
creations-chat 2021-12-04 19:01:21 how much do you think i need to raise the conning tower, or does it look good now since i lowered the turrets
creations-chat 2021-12-04 19:03:24 alright thanks for the help
creations-chat 2021-12-04 19:11:06 i mean the real ships turrets are kinda flat, <@!580743934171676672> iowa class
creations-chat 2021-12-04 19:14:57 theyre 3 blocks tall already 🗿
creations-chat 2021-12-04 19:17:01 if i make them four they would be too fat though, wouldnt they?
creations-chat 2021-12-04 19:19:05 well shoot maybe if i made them 20 id be good 🧠

creations-chat 2021-12-05 18:59:39 why are the turrets so rotund, are those tnt blocks on the side lol?, theres like no superstructure
creations-chat 2021-12-05 19:01:43 rotund means fat and round, also why are the barrels so short??
creations-chat 2021-12-05 19:04:13 i mean they seem kinda fat to me and the barrels look way too short

creations-chat 2021-12-05 19:09:51 last time i checked turrets that are 4 blocks tall and  almost as tall as your superstructure doesnt mean sleek, it means im about to vomit 🤮 your entire superstructure is practically a box, i say delete the whole thing and start over
creations-chat 2021-12-05 19:12:10 9.7k blocks wtf????? what did you do fill the interior full of blocks?? and if this is your best build i dont want to even imagine what your worst build looks like 😳
creations-chat 2021-12-05 19:15:11 then fix the back if you changed the type of ship halfway through your build <:tarded:831359068387016727>
creations-chat 2021-12-05 19:17:25 just accept your ship is complete garbage and you have a skill issue and i dont have my expectations set too high your ship is just bad
creations-chat 2021-12-05 19:21:39 i wonder why

creations-chat 2021-12-05 21:57:44 why is it so small and also no mast
creations-chat 2021-12-05 22:03:56 maybe put some text on the side with black squares for small little windows
creations-chat 2021-12-05 22:28:24 ok
creations-chat 2021-12-05 22:30:26 make the smoke a little darker, i imagine this is a coal powered vessel right?
creations-chat 2021-12-05 22:32:56 i would still make the smoke darker, i imagine oil would still burn a dark gray/black color. I mean take for example oil powered steam trains, the smoke is really dark

creations-chat 2022-02-25 01:56:36 thanks, i plan on adding windows to the sides eventually with text so i think that might break up the color on the hull and add a little variation (if not i can probably try adding different shades of gray)

help 2022-08-18 01:44:14 just noticed
help 2022-08-18 01:44:18 im a little special my bad
help 2022-08-18 01:45:30 connect the middle fold and first fold with cameras and put a motor in the middle facing up
help 2022-08-18 01:54:47 show me where you're trying to fold it
help 2022-08-18 01:59:32 ok well theres a bit of a problem here
help 2022-08-18 01:59:44 not sure why you put the middle on top instead of directly beside the front piece
help 2022-08-18 02:00:12 normally when building ships you want to put the 1st and 2nd fold directly next to eachother
help 2022-08-18 02:00:46 you're gonna need to move those cams and motors to the very end of the front fold
help 2022-08-18 02:01:00 so put them on that very last block
help 2022-08-18 02:02:45 yes
help 2022-08-18 02:03:12 hmm

help 2022-08-18 02:04:29 maybe ask someone more skilled
help 2022-08-18 02:04:34 but as far as i know im not really sure if you can fold it
help 2022-08-18 02:05:51 to keep it simple i would switch the end and middle piece
help 2022-08-18 02:05:54 so have the end on the top
help 2022-08-18 02:05:56 and the middle on the bottom
