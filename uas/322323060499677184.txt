creations-chat 2019-08-27 11:19:37 Am I just able to plant an image of my creation in here and it gets put in <#384025409945337856>
creations-chat 2019-08-27 11:20:00 you spaced out the letters as if to say you're sarcastic
creations-chat 2019-08-27 11:20:15 so I might ask someone else about that
creations-chat 2019-08-27 11:21:07 My happy little Messerschmitt BF-109
creations-chat 2019-08-28 01:26:17 all of these planes are nice but why build a passenger plane when you can build yourself a Messerschmitt Bf-109 and dress in a German uniform  https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/563779841212547091/615857541200740352/RobloxScreenShot20190827_113747402.png

creations-chat 2019-08-28 01:26:40 I didnâ€™t mean to input the long paragraph
creations-chat 2019-08-28 01:26:45 into the creations channel
creations-chat 2019-08-28 01:26:53 I was meant to separate the link
creations-chat 2019-08-28 01:26:55 for fucks sake
creations-chat 2019-08-28 01:26:57 wait no
creations-chat 2019-08-28 01:27:00 for godâ€™s sake
creations-chat 2019-08-28 01:27:10 Yes I know
creations-chat 2019-08-28 01:27:29 What Iâ€™m saying is, if I separated the link to be an individual message to the paragraph
creations-chat 2019-08-28 01:27:42 it wouldnâ€™t be sat in the creations chat
creations-chat 2019-08-28 01:27:46 without any context

creations-chat 2019-08-29 17:23:13 I've made my own happy little boat, it looks a bit more like a second Reich boat but I don't want a ban
creations-chat 2019-08-29 17:23:19 
creations-chat 2019-08-29 17:23:57 oh god
creations-chat 2019-08-29 17:24:04 the chat just gave my joke away
creations-chat 2019-08-29 17:24:22 it's in a private server so technically I'm not publicly saying it?
creations-chat 2019-08-29 17:24:46 And I don't exactly support it so
creations-chat 2019-08-29 17:24:59 I mean someone's still going to get me banned anyway
creations-chat 2019-08-29 17:25:08 and there's likely nothing I can do about it
creations-chat 2019-08-29 17:25:09 oh well

creations-chat 2019-08-29 20:41:46

creations-chat 2019-08-29 20:42:11 I can't be bothered making it open like a genuine van door right now
creations-chat 2019-08-29 20:42:16 but I'll attempt it tomorrow
creations-chat 2019-08-31 01:57:21 whatâ€™s the point of a submarine if the gameâ€™s physics donâ€™t allow air inside your ship
creations-chat 2019-08-31 01:57:26 if itâ€™s submerged
creations-chat 2019-08-31 01:57:29 completely
creations-chat 2019-08-31 01:57:47 in fact thatâ€™s just robloxâ€™s general physics
creations-chat 2019-08-31 04:06:43 bean
creations-chat 2019-08-31 16:26:59 Built a driveable Stagecoach bus from Britain, the front of the bus doesnt do well on hills though due to it's large overhang
creations-chat 2019-08-31 16:27:05 
creations-chat 2019-08-31 16:27:11 
creations-chat 2019-08-31 16:27:34 it's not perfect but I'm too lazy for perfect
creations-chat 2019-08-31 21:19:58 jesus christ do you expect a master replica or something
creations-chat 2019-08-31 21:20:19 yesd
creations-chat 2019-08-31 21:20:34 i tried my best you little feces B)
creations-chat 2019-08-31 21:21:05 plus its fun to run over pedestrians so why not do it in a fashionable vehicle
the-dump 2019-09-01 00:47:13 hold up a moment
the-dump 2019-09-01 00:47:25 `girlfriend: picked up from school`
creations-chat 2019-09-01 11:41:07 <@456226577798135808> Hey man with your submarine, wouldnâ€™t it just fill up with water upon going under? Or is there something ingame that can actually stop that from happening?
creations-chat 2019-09-01 11:42:08 How is it considered working then
creations-chat 2019-09-01 11:42:14 I mean heâ€™s built it really well but
creations-chat 2019-09-01 11:42:53 Why did he even build a submarine
creations-chat 2019-09-01 11:42:57 if you can build a bus
creations-chat 2019-09-01 11:43:15 what do you mean â€˜.......â€™
creations-chat 2019-09-01 11:44:46 I like vehicles that can be used for more than just driving around aimlessly
creations-chat 2019-09-01 11:45:14 a submarine would fill up with water, any rockets will instantly explode in water
creations-chat 2019-09-01 11:45:31 I have my own fighter jet I named as a V1 viking B)
creations-chat 2019-09-01 11:45:48 I also built a Messerschmitt, a Kubelwagen and a Tiger tank
creations-chat 2019-09-01 11:46:00 And my own boat with 2nd Reich patterns
creations-chat 2019-09-01 11:46:33 my Kubelwagen also has an artillery gun which can be detached from the vehicle
creations-chat 2019-09-01 11:46:55 yes but it takes `effort` to make your own missiles
creations-chat 2019-09-01 11:47:23 I have lots of builds but I donâ€™t think any of them reach a minimum requirement
creations-chat 2019-09-01 11:47:45 I still have no idea what yawing a rocket means
creations-chat 2019-09-01 11:47:59 ah
creations-chat 2019-09-01 11:48:15 I could implement that
creations-chat 2019-09-01 11:48:43 my rocket already flies upwards and I can land it
creations-chat 2019-09-01 11:56:29 What do you mean by that, I have a plane that flies and turns well and is over 200 blocks
creations-chat 2019-09-01 11:56:36 and thatâ€™s basically going to get me a rank?
creations-chat 2019-09-01 11:59:16 I could also tell everyone my bus is unique and get someone to give me a designer role ðŸ˜Ž
creations-chat 2019-09-01 13:12:14 but why
creations-chat 2019-09-01 13:12:21 thatâ€™s a lot of effort and time
creations-chat 2019-09-01 13:12:31 over some lego game
creations-chat 2019-09-01 13:12:32 B)
creations-chat 2019-09-01 15:48:01 I've made a basic Gatling gun that turns, spins the barrel and goes up/down
creations-chat 2019-09-01 15:51:54 why
creations-chat 2019-09-01 17:20:53 I've built a little control station protected by walls, surrounded by grass with a Gatling gun that spins the barrel, turns and goes up/down. I'm planning to add a T34 battle tank here to use, possibly a helicopter.
creations-chat 2019-09-01 17:23:44 I didn't ask
creations-chat 2019-09-01 17:24:42 Listen I'm not some professional builder who sweats his mantits on this
creations-chat 2019-09-01 17:24:51 so don't expect me to build a masterpiece
creations-chat 2019-09-01 17:25:15 beaned
creations-chat 2019-09-01 17:25:54 I was posting expecting at least a little bit of feedback from someone?
creations-chat 2019-09-01 17:26:34 Saying 'looks like something from 2012 noob haha wasdsawdasdwasdsadwdsadwa' doesn't help me figure out
creations-chat 2019-09-01 17:26:40 how to make it not look 2012
creations-chat 2019-09-01 17:27:05 I was setting up an untrue example to make Vip look worse than he is B)
creations-chat 2019-09-01 17:27:30 I never said I didn't expect insults either <@!395442152793964547>
creations-chat 2019-09-01 17:28:45 steady on mate you don't need to go full caps
creations-chat 2019-09-01 17:29:52 What says I'm an underage
creations-chat 2019-09-01 17:30:09 You'll likely say 'its obvious' but there's nothing that's literally telling you
creations-chat 2019-12-03 20:01:50 how did you make that
creations-chat 2019-12-03 20:01:56 seriously I wanna know
creations-chat 2019-12-03 20:02:15 I mean I might try an ATST instead simply because it's easier
creations-chat 2019-12-03 20:02:28 but knowing how that ATAT works would really help
creations-chat 2019-12-08 12:48:54 I tried making a flak 38, while it's not the most accurate one it works pretty well and the motor2 isn't having a heart attack so I like it
creations-chat 2019-12-08 12:51:27 cheers man
creations-chat 2019-12-08 13:03:45 My Messerschmitt BF-109
creations-chat 2019-12-09 07:59:51 I have Stagecoach single decker bus
creations-chat 2019-12-09 08:00:12 and Iâ€™m going to update it today to give it signs and stuff
creations-chat 2019-12-09 23:13:54 I have a katyusha ingame that I need to update actually
creations-chat 2019-12-09 23:14:00 Iâ€™ll do that tomorrow
creations-chat 2019-12-27 18:24:00 some headers keep saying my BF-109 is copied from a youtube video, and I assure you there's no video of this plane online, I did do a tutorial one like 4 months ago but I got rid of it and made my own because of how inaccurate it was
creations-chat 2019-12-27 18:24:37 
creations-chat 2019-12-27 19:21:13 A bit of a chonky version of the Katyusha artillery truck
creations-chat 2019-12-27 19:21:31 
creations-chat 2019-12-27 21:17:43 Not an amazing build, but it's an Opel Blitz with a mounted Flak 38 on the back, the disconnectors are there so I can hold my trapdoors up, I disconnect them upon spawning
creations-chat 2019-12-27 21:17:45 
creations-chat 2019-12-27 21:25:52 it is one
creations-chat 2019-12-27 21:26:01 I just realised the wheels are grey
creations-chat 2019-12-27 21:28:04 oh wait the wheels are meant to be grey according to images
creations-chat 2019-12-27 21:28:06 right
creations-chat 2019-12-27 21:29:53 Britain is superior to America
creations-chat 2019-12-27 21:29:56 filthy colonial
creations-chat 2019-12-27 21:44:30 I'm sad that it's going to be a challenge if I want to make a giant British flag
creations-chat 2019-12-27 21:44:36 I will  just do an English flag
creations-chat 2019-12-27 21:45:30 cax you can just do a yellow blocky circle
creations-chat 2019-12-27 21:45:37 of it
creations-chat 2019-12-27 21:45:37 with some greens and blacks in the middle
creations-chat 2019-12-27 21:45:44 it doesn't look too much of a challenge
creations-chat 2019-12-28 01:00:20 <@!476100923408646147> How do you make planes loop
creations-chat 2019-12-31 03:45:43 I had a sick tie fighter that looked amazing
creations-chat 2019-12-31 03:45:49 but it couldnâ€™t fly
creations-chat 2019-12-31 03:45:52 for some reason
creations-chat 2019-12-31 18:30:06 Made a somewhat decent Hawker Hurricane, downside is you can see the blue flames from the rocket engine at the front, I also don't have a WWII RAF uniform so I'm stuck with my regular uniform
creations-chat 2019-12-31 18:30:07 
creations-chat 2019-12-31 18:47:42 it's not amazing but I've gave my BF-109 a bit of a repaint for winter
creations-chat 2019-12-31 18:47:55 not based off of anything
creations-chat 2019-12-31 18:49:10 
creations-chat 2020-01-04 01:13:09 <@456226577798135808> yo bossman sorry to tag you but how did you make Lukeâ€™s speeder float
creations-chat 2020-01-04 01:13:38 Iâ€™m trying to make a TX-130 Republic tank so it would help if I know how you made yours float
creations-chat 2020-01-04 01:14:55 oh lol forgot about that
creations-chat 2020-01-04 01:15:00 cheers r kid
creations-chat 2020-01-05 02:11:04 die
creations-chat 2020-01-07 08:11:10 <@285177924645027840> G you beat me to it, was gonna try and make the Ausmerzer
creations-chat 2020-01-07 08:11:55 is it just me or is frau engel fit in New Order
creations-chat 2020-01-12 10:39:38 didnâ€™t ask
creations-chat 2020-01-12 20:10:50 Messerschmitt BF-109 with a crappy winter camo
creations-chat 2020-01-12 20:11:28 had to escape after literally being shot down, but I forgot my M30 drilling and now some sort of dangerous animal like a Soviet or something, is going to eat me alive while I have no way of defending myself
creations-chat 2020-01-18 10:53:58 Is there a way to use conveyors on a tank, while making it able to turn?
creations-chat 2020-01-19 00:08:18 liking it
creations-chat 2020-01-19 00:08:54 I have a few decent builds but I can't be bothered digging out loads of images
creations-chat 2020-01-19 00:09:44 here's a nice looking (at least in my opinion) Kawanishi N1K2
creations-chat 2020-01-19 00:10:03 a sort of winter camo for my BF-109
creations-chat 2020-01-19 00:10:13 not as good as my original paint for it
creations-chat 2020-01-19 00:11:02 Opel Blitz, turret looks a bit fugly and I know someone will point it out as a spammer gun of some sort, but it functions well
creations-chat 2020-01-19 00:11:49 the disconnectors by the door are just holding up the door, I disconnect them when I spawn it in
creations-chat 2020-01-19 12:56:49 made the mistake of trying to make an AT-ST, anyone know how I can make this thing successfully walk?
creations-chat 2020-01-19 16:05:32 unpainted A6 Juggernaut
creations-chat 2020-01-19 16:05:44 https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/383729588272103427/668485958802472976/juggernaut66.png Used this to make it
creations-chat 2020-01-19 16:06:02 although that image is actually backwards
creations-chat 2020-01-19 16:06:09 I used a few more similar to it
creations-chat 2020-01-19 16:06:22 
creations-chat 2020-01-19 16:06:34 no interior as of yet, besides a few seats
creations-chat 2020-01-19 16:15:40 didn't ask
creations-chat 2020-01-19 16:37:38 
help 2020-01-21 21:48:19 not in there
help 2020-01-21 21:48:24 that's why I'm confused
help 2020-01-21 21:48:31 I see people with them but I cannot find it myself
help 2020-01-21 21:52:32 rite got it
help 2020-01-21 21:52:34 cheers hyper x
creations-chat 2020-01-22 18:54:46 Spartan mate would you mind if I interpreted my own (by that I mean copy) your A 74-Z
creations-chat 2020-01-22 19:38:12 cheers
creations-chat 2020-01-22 19:38:39 might make a republic speeder to go with my A6 Juggernaut
creations-chat 2020-01-22 19:39:03 but it would be horrible to have to give it arrow keys because otherwise the speeder and A6 would move at the same time
creations-chat 2020-02-16 12:39:53 My A6 Juggernaut from Star Wars, 1076 blocks, includes a small turret which is based off a clone turret I saw in the first ever SW battlefront, has a boarding station with an officer's desk and a holo-computer thing, a few crates and obviously the juggernaut itself. The Juggernaut is a little bit undersized but I can live with that
