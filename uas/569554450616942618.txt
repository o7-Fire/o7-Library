The Tale of delta4162 (569554450616942618)
creations-chat 2020-11-13 01:34:05 hah I made it when I was like 8 those were literally the first 3 words to come to the mind of an 8 year old apparently
creations-chat 2020-11-14 07:15:48 <@!757839647496994837> That's a good idea and well executed (In my opinion)
bug-reports 2020-11-14 09:12:58 I'm doing the challenge where you have to land 3 stages of a rocket, and I came across an interesting glitch: I have my stages connected via magnets and when the magnets are connected and I activate an anchor block on the top stage, deactivate the magnet (With the anchor block still on), and then turn the anchor block off, the stage that was disconnected will instantly teleport straight to the ground instead of falling. Idk if this is already a known issue but I figured I'd let whoever reads these know anyway just in case.
bug-reports 2020-11-14 16:18:13 Yeah <@!403843930543882241> the system I was planning on using to disconnect them wasn't going to fit in my design so I had to go with magnets, I'll have to redesign it so it will fit
creations-chat 2020-11-16 03:10:49 <@!683847069890510887> It says above the picture that it's not done yet, and I can't speak for anyone else but I generally don't paint 'till the end
creations-chat 2020-11-16 21:05:53 That is in fact the reason I downvoted
creations-chat 2020-11-17 05:26:44 <@!743010779229454346> Just curious as to why you downvoted my plane, not asking you to change it just want to know so I can change it on the plane
creations-chat 2020-11-17 05:28:44 Oof, well... I mean if that's the only reason you downvoted consider at least removing it I'm trying to get Aero engineer 5 ;-; Thanks üôÇ
creations-chat 2020-11-17 05:30:58 Thanks, I think it may be the angle it's almost 2 plots long lol. Maybe I'll make it 1.5 blocks thick instead of 2.5
creations-chat 2020-11-17 05:54:16 <@456226577798135808> Nice landing gear on that 767

creations-chat 2020-11-18 02:51:48 <@!647291454590550057> What exactly is it that you built, it looks cool but is it meant to be anything in particular? Cool I'll upvote it
creations-chat 2020-11-18 04:51:13 <@456226577798135808> You would have my upvote if it weren't for the rockets on the wings
creations-chat 2020-11-18 05:00:40 lol my hovering sign + rainbow thing is now named "Positivity.exe"
creations-chat 2020-11-18 06:47:17 You can make larger custom wheels <@!293301655464574986>
creations-chat 2020-11-18 06:51:29 <@!293301655464574986> Go into into the top tab of the build menu, then scroll down to "Cylinders" if I were you I'd probably either use "Cylinder 2 2x2" or "Cylinder 3x3" there are a other options you could go with as well
creations-chat 2020-11-18 06:53:39 <@!293301655464574986> Connect them to motors
creations-chat 2020-11-18 07:05:54 lol you probably didn't do it right
creations-chat 2020-11-18 07:12:34 Try making it shorter I think it'll look better then
creations-chat 2020-11-18 07:26:55 Hm that's a good point got my downvote for that lol
creations-chat 2020-11-18 07:28:44 Oh yeah it's even the same picture : O so it's not even a progress update or anything lol. I mean the only reason would be to get more upvotes... but you're not gonna get more upvotes at this time of night lol
creations-chat 2020-11-18 07:32:12 It's to long anyway you need to shorten it and add more wedges in the front
creations-chat 2020-11-18 07:53:45 : O Can I see the rocket? Oh wait nevermind I see it, nice
creations-chat 2020-11-18 08:00:48 <@!568517652306460699> A masterpiece...that deserves to be in the Hall of Fame

creations-chat 2020-11-18 20:49:58 You could try adding treads (I don't make tanks though so I don't know if that would be possible)
creations-chat 2020-11-18 20:52:03 <@!746022074216218625> A downvote for the repost, and a mental downvote for the wheels
creations-chat 2020-11-18 20:53:57 ‚ù§Ô∏è : P
creations-chat 2020-11-18 20:59:10 <@!746022074216218625> you've literally posted the same creation 3 times lol, no wonder you don't have the "I read the rules" role : O
creations-chat 2020-11-18 21:00:45 yeah but you're just posting it over and over again trying to get more likes
creations-chat 2020-11-18 21:02:38 lol must be glitched then <@!719168864705052802> you don't have it either, I got it when I clicked on it I don't remember when that was
creations-chat 2020-11-18 21:04:21 they must've just removed the role entirely ig, I meant they removed it from everyone else, or the bot is bugged idk
creations-chat 2020-11-18 21:32:49 <@!746022074216218625> isn't that a default tutorial plane lol
creations-chat 2020-11-18 21:34:20 hm to me it looked like a tutorial plane with pvp weapons lol maybe I'm blind
creations-chat 2020-11-18 21:42:27 lol the only thing I don't like about that C17 is the gap between the wings and the fuselage ;-;
creations-chat 2020-11-18 21:45:17 <@!721734392971526164> Self upvotes don't count fyi
creations-chat 2020-11-18 21:47:27 I downvoted it because the outside looks kind of bland in my opinion, but yeah everyone likes it, or everyone dislikes it for some reason lol
creations-chat 2020-11-18 21:49:15 What's with all the tutorials in creations today lol
creations-chat 2020-11-18 21:58:15 thicc boi
creations-chat 2020-11-18 22:08:51 <@!721734392971526164> That doesn't look like it's 2000 blocks though...
creations-chat 2020-11-18 22:10:26 Ohhhh yeah that exists nvm
creations-chat 2020-11-18 22:14:42 <@!566765848354750514> What are its dimensions?
creations-chat 2020-11-18 22:22:37 3 Days playing the game or 3 days  on the discord.. I got expert on my first day on the discord : P
creations-chat 2020-11-18 22:25:34 I've never actually built a presentable robot before lol, probably my next project after a carrier I'm working on
creations-chat 2020-11-18 22:28:07 <@!489910972946055172> Can't say for sure, but I have a feeling it's fine that he posted his friend's creation as long as his friend wanted him to which he did apparently
creations-chat 2020-11-18 23:05:47 I like the intakes, but I'm pretty sure the f35's wings are bigger... also on the real F35 they are intakes and not for missiles
creations-chat 2020-11-18 23:07:18 I think the wings are also bigger on an F22 : P ye the wings start further up on the plane, it would probably show it better from a side view
creations-chat 2020-11-18 23:09:08 Yeah because it's a WIP lol Read <#533294912586645521> ... not telling you to remove it just saying that's why I downvoted it
creations-chat 2020-11-18 23:12:09 
creations-chat 2020-11-18 23:15:22 lol yeah self upvotes don't even count
creations-chat 2020-11-18 23:16:53 Nice cursor <@!716121757131735101>
creations-chat 2020-11-18 23:19:29 Lol
creations-chat 2020-11-18 23:35:43 ü¶Ä : "*Delete self upvote*"
creations-chat 2020-11-18 23:49:48 Isn't it kinda short height wise? Yeah ^
creations-chat 2020-11-19 00:17:45 <@456226577798135808> It goes side to side because when the other leg lifts up it tilts to that side, and there must be more weight in the front than in the back so it makes it do that
bot-central 2020-11-19 00:48:22 !servers
creations-chat 2020-11-19 01:42:21 Then you probably didn't save it, you sure nothing happens when you press load on the save slot? (even if it didn't show your saved version when you joined)
creations-chat 2020-11-19 01:46:14 Maybe you saved the the wrong slot? Or clicked load instead of save maybe.. Idk it could be a bug but it's never happened to me and I've never heard of it happening to anyone else. Anyway I gtg for a bit have a good night :/ sorry, good luck though
creations-chat 2020-11-19 03:58:42 Dolphin:
creations-chat 2020-11-19 08:26:15 <@!291956715749113868> Didn't you post the exact same thing yesterday? Yeah but you're not supposed to put WIPs in there anyway lol
creations-chat 2020-11-19 08:28:31 I mean you didn't show the interior, but you said the interior was completed so it's basically the same. lol just admit it, it's a repost
creations-chat 2020-11-19 09:35:00 It's a wip
creations-chat 2020-11-19 09:38:56 tbh I downvote all wips just because they're wips lol, I agree with vipEmpire : P
creations-chat 2020-11-19 09:40:27 breh you keep reposting it and referencing it lol it's getting annoying
creations-chat 2020-11-19 09:43:16 lol <@!291956715749113868> just counted, you posted it twice in <#384025409945337856> and referenced it twice in this channel : P
creations-chat 2020-11-19 09:46:27 Bro do you even realize it's against the rules to keep referencing it, like bruh it's annoying
creations-chat 2020-11-19 09:48:22 He did it twice there regardless lul
creations-chat 2020-11-19 22:35:13 Lol

creations-chat 2020-11-19 23:38:54 <@!658318819248570381> You shouldn't post WIPs then I won't downvote it
creations-chat 2020-11-20 05:06:04 <@!623859281946476554> the engines and command module still look weird
creations-chat 2020-11-20 05:10:57 (In my opinion)
creations-chat 2020-11-20 19:33:37 That's a thing?
creations-chat 2020-11-20 19:35:54 I don't use lights that frequently but if was my guess there's probably no way to fix it yourself
creations-chat 2020-11-22 09:40:06 lol <@456226577798135808> that looks nearly identical to mine
creations-chat 2020-11-25 18:16:06 <@!774377045346091008> but... you realize you can get like e+ speed...
