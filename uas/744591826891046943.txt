The process of improving your build is:

1. post in <#504436696021204992> 
2. get bombarded by the people.
3. Start an argument 🍿 
4. Then post it again and ask what do i improve now.
5. They gonna say delete it.
6. There will be one guy mostly <@!723940197456281640> <:trollface:775024642104229898> willing to help.
7. Follow what they say. And you're good to go.

<@!490593164445483028> Pretty good overall, but few additions:

1. The block in the middle (the rectangular grey block)

2. The gap between the lines near the D-Pad.

3. The little block on the top.

4. The extra half block up on top of the black start and select buttons.

5. The stud detail on the studs on the D-Pad

6. The second gray stripe missing on your build.

increase the length of this atenna thing to 2 and a half or 2 trails (nose)
creations-chat 2022-02-08 11:18:54 Increase the length of the front trail by 1 and a half...

Add landing gear <:m_:778994206948589638> 

Also does it have an after burner?

if no then add it
help 2022-02-08 11:19:05 np
creations-chat 2022-02-08 11:27:02 few more changes...

move the fuel tanks to the inner pylons and the missile to the middle ones and the rocket pod to the outer pylon...

make the center funni tank larger...

And yes add a gunpod ( i will give a french one since your jet is based off the mirage? I hope so bcus of the mirage naming on the side)
 
and maybe make the gunpod slightly angled towards the missile so that it looks a bit cooler (maybe like 10 degrees?)
creations-chat 2022-02-08 11:36:38 If I'm not wrong... It's because physics... although they dont exist in the game <:trollface:775024642104229898>, if such heavy bois are places to the end of the wings, the weight they exert will be more... and if placed near the intakes on the inner pylons their  weight is comparatively low since they are near the whole aircraft...

Hence they put the light ones (missiles =) towards the end their relative weight wont effect the plane much...

also no the more the merrier <:trollface:775024642104229898>, so add a separate gun pod
creations-chat 2022-02-08 11:38:44 just interchange the position of the drop tank and the missile, dont have to move the rocket pod
creations-chat 2022-02-08 11:41:28 <:trollface:775024642104229898> 

also since you are move the drop tanks to the inner pylons make them longer by a block

wait why are drop tanks motor locked

creations-chat 2022-09-09 15:56:45 <@691825046590718111>  wings generate more drag than <@527092191189925918>'s mom, make them shorter 

+ this area is too plain, add some more gradient over there and use a slight darker shade of white.

Also missiles dont apply to your camo, so give them some color

<@448677698773057547>  he always knew how it would look <:empty:794431705070174238>

creations-chat 2022-09-09 16:02:36 he mentioned he is aware of the short nose smh <:m_:778994206948589638> 

Also <@691825046590718111> (Get pinged nerd)

the pylons on the wings (both) should be a block or 2 further outside

Its shit now, the builds are not upto the mark but still get 100s of upvotes

Expert rank requirements havent been raised, too many expert rankers
There are builds which do not deserve the upvotes, simply because there are few details wrong in them

<@496779210728275969> not really, its just that the size is smaller in planes compared to ships so you dont notice much, planes and ships with equal efforts put into it, have ships with more locking
creations-chat 2023-02-02 14:48:01 ok so.

1. Delete it

2. Restart

3, use **wedges 2 section**to smoothen out parts

4. use angle locking where possible

5. use this image to build your way, you can either overlay image with your build yourslf or ask someone here

6. ask for help, people will help you but come on you should be able to face some comments
creations-chat 2023-02-02 14:51:00 that's because people like a guy above, pisses  us off with random shitty sentences, we help <:trollface:775024642104229898> 

<@477183726174994442> not a wrong idea, i faced similar stuff when i was new, there are many people who can help you, just be open and ask for help! *(or you can join a pcc youtuber's server like boxness, gjsolo, firey etc for much better shit)*

creations-chat 2023-02-17 10:30:44 A big aircraft is a good place to practice motorlock

Try using motorlock to add frames to the windshield, use wedges of different kinds to make your windshield look angular  and some extra detail in the jet like antennas etc

The shape is up to you and can't really tell until you proceed further
creations-chat 2023-02-17 12:32:59 check if you can smoothen this part on top
creations-chat 2023-02-17 14:29:05 it would be quite tough unless he puts black blocks for windshield, i.e no interior

or <@791259000561074188> you can motorlock delta wing 1x1 on the glass

Dss3 use motorlock, use multilple half wedge from half blocks to get a thinner engine, because they are too big atm. also the nose could use a bit more of angle. try use fdifferent shapes of wedges
