creations-chat 2022-08-12 17:14:36 why do so many ppl dislike such awsome builds
creations-chat 2022-08-12 17:16:42 literally half the builds in creations all of them are amazing yet have horrible dislike to like ratios including the private jet and so many awsome builds
creations-chat 2022-08-12 17:18:59 but its a good build, dont look at how the build looks weird, look at all the effort put into it and that it works and is functional. it also doesnt matter if it looks off bc imo it looks great
creations-chat 2022-08-12 17:22:17 but this isnt a tutorial plane and still the only reason ti doestn count is bc the tutorial plane is a plane everyone has but this one is a bit original actuallya nd thats what people dont appreciate it looks strange but its original and even if you were new and took and hour to understand he physics and build the tutorial plane i would congratulate you on succeeding at least and putting effort
creations-chat 2022-08-12 17:24:28 it looks original and imo it looks good and i appreciate the effort
creations-chat 2022-08-12 17:26:45 <@436609148608708608> i honestly love that design and that its original and it looks great for your first motor locked build and honestly dont mind the downvotes, everyone starts somewhere and your build looks amazing

creations-chat 2022-08-25 10:31:16 also whats wrong with my plane that you downvoted <@670101431071801384> <@654091171433283637> tell me please so i can improve
creations-chat 2022-08-25 10:37:30 thanks for actually helping me to improve instead of downvoting just coz it looks bad without acknowledging the effort. seriously i spent 2 days on ti and to those who get downvoted, dont get discouraged. your builds are great and just that people downvote it because they expect the most perfect build and dont even bother to give ways to help improve.
creations-chat 2022-08-25 10:39:34 tf is wrong with *your* neck <:skullclown:964050069982679050>

creations-chat 2022-08-25 11:49:08 lmao imagine using insults just because your a higher rank and literally cant come up with a good answer dont delete the build its your choice and its your effort dont get pressured by what others think
creations-chat 2022-08-25 11:51:15 my point still stands whatever shit insults or comebacks you guys say

help 2022-09-10 15:03:41 will my gamepasses be kept in pc2?
creations-chat 2022-09-11 08:05:51 reason for downvote? probably none. please give ways to improve. if you got none then ill probably ignore you
creations-chat 2022-09-12 05:28:59 i stan you, just because a build doesnt look extremly realistic and detailed in evey single blok they will mass downvote it. even when we ask for constructive feedback they wont do anything. they dont think about the effort involved and they literally mass upvote builds of toilets that are literally hella easy to make
creations-chat 2022-09-12 22:42:45 
creations-chat 2022-09-12 22:45:09 lol that means your previous account got deleted, probably because underage. thats a sign that even discord themselves want you off of this platform
