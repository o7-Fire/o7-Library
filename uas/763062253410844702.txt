creations-chat 2022-10-23 21:32:30 You should see me play piano
creations-chat 2022-10-23 21:37:17 I usually play on a piano meant for ages 3+ (it’s less than a foot long) plus I don’t pursue music
creations-chat 2022-10-23 21:42:39 I just recently learned that song btw (I’m a self learner)
creations-chat 2022-10-23 21:45:02 Oh, either way I’m better at a smaller piano
creations-chat 2022-10-23 21:49:37 My piano *I own* only has 1.5 octaves, like I said it’s for ages 3+ so size aint big

creations-chat 2023-07-11 15:40:23 its simple, a bit of angle lock and motor lock and some horns and now you got a 8 cylinder radial engine
creations-chat 2023-07-11 15:42:31 I did somewhat the same thing but only used motors
creations-chat 2023-07-12 14:32:23 Yes
