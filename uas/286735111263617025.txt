creations-chat 2020-08-15 23:36:26 any good ideas for something i could make?
creations-chat 2020-08-15 23:38:04 finally someone noticed
creations-chat 2020-08-16 00:00:41 i should try making something from Terraria too
creations-chat 2020-08-16 00:00:47 *OOH*
creations-chat 2020-08-16 00:00:50 THE EYE
creations-chat 2020-08-16 00:02:08 i'm gonna make a giant eye-ball with a detach thing to make its mouth appear
creations-chat 2020-08-16 00:02:19 its gonna take a fricking century but its gonna look *sick*
creations-chat 2020-08-16 00:07:21 <@!280020722431295488> some Smash Bros edits and that clip turns into a *really* good meme
creations-chat 2020-08-16 00:10:55 <@!280020722431295488> yeah, but its gonna take the whole video, add the final hit thing, some off-screen effects and the narrator saying "GAME"
creations-chat 2020-08-16 00:11:13 oh, start with that then
creations-chat 2020-08-16 00:12:46 i never played smash bros, what do you call that super hit that gets all the screen effects and stuff
creations-chat 2020-08-16 00:14:36 oh i found out the name, its the *finishing zoom*
creations-chat 2020-08-16 03:23:42 do i use conveyors as tank tracks?
creations-chat 2020-08-16 03:47:58 how do i spin something without the other side spinning with it too?
creations-chat 2020-08-16 03:48:48 spin something without both of the sides connected to the motor spinning
creations-chat 2020-08-16 03:48:54 i just want one thing to spin
creations-chat 2020-08-16 03:50:38 let me try to explain it better: (SIDE1 MOTOR SIDE2), i want MOTOR to spin only SIDE2, but its spinning SIDE1 too for some reason
creations-chat 2020-08-16 03:52:03 fine, i'll show you a video
creations-chat 2020-08-16 03:52:40 
creations-chat 2020-08-16 03:53:02 and it wants you to download it instead of just fricking showing the video, nice
creations-chat 2020-08-16 03:55:05 you sure there is no way? because helicopters (in real life) work like the way i want, it only spins the top instead of spinning the whole thing
creations-chat 2020-08-16 03:57:02 alright, fine, i'll try some anchors
creations-chat 2020-08-16 08:23:39 Aight i made a regular excavator, what else you guys want me to do
