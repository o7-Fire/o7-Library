help 2022-11-23 16:26:53 Okay so I'm having issues
help 2022-11-23 16:27:03 I'm trying to build a wheelchair
help 2022-11-23 16:27:14 But I can't find a good propulsion method
help 2022-11-23 16:27:34 Everything is either too fast and impossible to control (such as the aeronautical motors)
help 2022-11-23 16:27:45 Or sticks out of the back (like conveyors)
help 2022-11-23 16:28:31 My build is only 3 blocks wide and I can't hide the conveyor underneath because that's where the motor lock that puts the wheels at an acceptable level is

help 2022-11-23 16:33:36 There's a difference between drifting and just flat out spinning
help 2022-11-23 16:33:44 Drifting is controllable
help 2022-11-23 16:34:12 I can't blow someone up with a wheelchair if I'm just spinning
help 2022-11-23 16:34:35 For reference, I'm trying to create an exploding wheelchair in reference to this scene:

creations-chat 2022-11-23 18:43:23 The fuck is a nam
creations-chat 2022-11-23 18:45:49 Not really new
creations-chat 2022-11-23 20:02:07 <@907408760253857812> it's good but it could be improved.

For one it's a bit short compared to the real thing. The colors are also very off. You can get more accurate by using a color picker app.
creations-chat 2022-11-23 20:05:23 Either way it does show some deficiencies that could be helped in later builds. You should consider using fireworks blocks for cylindrical prop hubs, and using delta wing panels or normal wings for the props themselves.
creations-chat 2022-11-23 20:07:41 I'd probably stop giving it for this build. Nothing more to say.
creations-chat 2022-11-23 20:38:00 It's very easy to build a shitty jet. Have some patience.
creations-chat 2022-11-24 00:00:02 <@768911678791352341> try 1940s raf camo

creations-chat 2022-11-24 04:16:52 I didn't just outright say "it's shit"

Which puts me ahead of like 99% of PCC criticism
creations-chat 2022-11-24 04:30:20 Just because its common doesn't mean it's constructive
creations-chat 2022-12-10 01:00:59 Eureka! I've found out why the majority of people in <#504436696021204992> are insufferable!
creations-chat 2022-12-10 01:03:35 It turns out most people here are as qualified as giving building advice as they are at giving dating advice
creations-chat 2022-12-10 01:06:55 When you think about it isnt it more of a helicopter??

Give this man the helicopter specialist rank or whatever the fuck its called right now
creations-chat 2022-12-10 01:39:08 If you read closely youll notice youre a fucking moron and the actual post would imply they have neither
creations-chat 2022-12-10 01:41:23 Based and chillpilled

<@527653676022628353> but are you insufferable
creations-chat 2022-12-10 01:43:30 I was never the exception. Im the rule exemplified. 

You are the exception here. The one we should all look up to. Youre not a complete dipshit like half the people here
creations-chat 2022-12-10 01:46:22 Because its a rare concept and well made
creations-chat 2022-12-10 01:48:40 Pretty good tbh. Slap on some steering for trolling purposes

creations-chat 2022-12-11 20:26:41 Its not an overengineered f14 replica (even though f14 is mid anyway) therefore downvote

the-dump 2022-12-11 20:39:40 Holy shit
creations-chat 2022-12-11 23:13:02 Stylistically that battlebot is actual doodoo
creations-chat 2022-12-11 23:16:55 Thanks to the lack of treads, suspension, or even a simple conveyor system, it probably also performs like doodoo offroad.

The main issues I have are the full scale realistic radar and CWIS glued onto what looks like a carboard box. 

I can't really give any good advice on how to make a better battlebot specifically, but I think maybe plane crazy isnt the best place to do it.
creations-chat 2022-12-11 23:28:05 <@456226577798135808>
creations-chat 2022-12-12 00:01:21 Suspension is a block in the gears tab. It allows a block on your build to move up and down (within reason), which makes it easier for said build to move across rough terrain (since the wheels can adapt to the height of the terrain)
creations-chat 2022-12-13 03:48:19 That f22 looks pretty good for a first time build.
creations-chat 2022-12-13 03:50:59 Likes and dislikes are just clicks that people fling around based on personal ideas. They have as much value to the builder as a jar of easy cheez thats been sitting out on a sidewalk for 5 years
creations-chat 2022-12-13 14:06:35 An(im)al crossing
creations-chat 2022-12-14 00:50:38 <@907408760253857812> you actually can't overpower your motherboard even if your psu outputs more watts on the label than necessary. You need to get a big, beefy-ass PSU and a decent graphics card and you can basically turn a shitty 2012 office computer into a great gaming rig
