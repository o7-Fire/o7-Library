creations-chat 2020-08-02 23:36:34 An old picture of the jet <@456226577798135808> tried to copy and post in creations chat
creations-chat 2020-08-02 23:36:57 I got my eyes on u
creations-chat 2020-08-02 23:36:59 not cool
creations-chat 2020-08-02 23:39:29 A ight, and if u did make this originally ima have beef with other ppl that i know
creations-chat 2020-08-02 23:40:27 bc thats the jet the plane crazy blue angels used early this year as a trainee jet and as the origional jet for the promo vid
creations-chat 2020-08-02 23:41:42 ?
creations-chat 2020-08-02 23:41:51 thats not an f18
creations-chat 2020-08-02 23:42:00 looks more like a jet inspired by the f22
creations-chat 2020-08-02 23:42:07 also thats my character in the jet
creations-chat 2020-08-02 23:42:33 i literally screenshotted a vid i had for hat pic
creations-chat 2020-08-02 23:42:53 it also uses darker colors than yours
creations-chat 2020-08-02 23:42:59 and has a higher top speed
creations-chat 2020-08-02 23:44:03 ._.
creations-chat 2020-08-02 23:44:26 my avatar
creations-chat 2020-08-02 23:45:16 ._.
creations-chat 2020-08-02 23:46:28 short clip from where i took the screen shot
creations-chat 2020-08-02 23:47:08 but
creations-chat 2020-08-02 23:47:13 u copied it
creations-chat 2020-08-02 23:47:14 not cool
creations-chat 2020-08-02 23:47:47 ._.
creations-chat 2020-08-02 23:48:28 so your just just so happens to have a very similar shape, exact wing design, and color pattern by coincidence
creations-chat 2020-08-02 23:49:09 but that is a fictional jet
creations-chat 2020-08-02 23:49:20 literally no jet the blue angels used look anything like that
creations-chat 2020-08-02 23:50:50 Ight then why do you also have wings behind the pilot seat where the half blocks are?
creations-chat 2020-08-02 23:51:15 thats not a normal thing a jet irl would use, and was a thing we did to improve pitch
creations-chat 2020-08-02 23:52:08 bc thats too similar for it to not be a blatant copy

creations-chat 2020-08-02 23:53:47 If you look at his photos it was recent as he doesnt have outlines, and my vid was from the winter update and when outlines existed
creations-chat 2020-08-02 23:54:17 and if u look up plane crazy blue angels, the first video showcased those jets allowing y to find a place to copy it
creations-chat 2020-08-02 23:55:20 the build credit goes to bigexplosivecake as he made the jet for the blue angels
creations-chat 2020-08-02 23:56:10 no
creations-chat 2020-08-02 23:56:17 we didnt make a yt vid bc it could leak
creations-chat 2020-08-02 23:56:29 it was a jet used by the blue anegls group for training
creations-chat 2020-08-02 23:57:22 ight my case is done
creations-chat 2020-08-02 23:57:27 ima dip now
creations-chat 2020-08-03 00:12:36 problem is that the jet i posted isnt based off the f18, or any blue angels jet, nor does any jet have the **exact same** stripe pattern as the one posted, and Tyler is trying to pass it off as an f18 when it was a copy

creations-chat 2021-04-06 16:31:19 no thats just my glitched mouse f16 with too much rudder on it
creations-chat 2021-04-06 17:29:13 no
creations-chat 2021-04-06 17:32:42 people assume that control surfaces have limited movement, and they cant handle the look of cheese graders on wings
creations-chat 2021-04-06 17:35:18 motor locking wings adds hella drag that i dont want, can cause lag, and glitched mouse can have as much control as wasd if you tune it right, with the benefit of not looking like its spazzing out every time you turn
creations-chat 2021-04-06 17:38:19 motor 2 mouse is more painful because you have to have a locked camera, doesnt allow for 360 views or easy rolls and is a point of failure in pvp
creations-chat 2021-04-06 17:40:33 *is keeping up with a WASD conveyor jet in my glitched mouse hover drive jet* - they can have the same maneuverability, but with mouse you can change the pitch at the moment, wasd you have to spam the key if you want to change pitch
creations-chat 2021-04-06 17:44:22 thats a lot of wobble, and having to toggle just to remain stable in flight adds another unnecessary complexity to flying
creations-chat 2021-04-06 17:48:56 <:trollface:775024642104229898>
creations-chat 2021-04-06 17:52:23 control surfaces have as much drag as a normal wing does, so dont make a jet with massive wings and youll be fine
Im still capable of hitting some pretty nice speeds with the power of cheese graders and without a conveyor to yeet me into infinity and beyond

creations-chat 2021-05-09 20:48:58 Z, in most cases this is true, even for my old mig, **but you can look at this shit block for block and it is the same build but with a different camo, and no way in hell is he gonna say that weapon loadout is his bc ive only seen destroyer use it and imo that gun placement is ass**
creations-chat 2021-05-09 20:52:56 ***the avionics are the same with the slight cheese grater for roll and the lowered elevators for pitch, which the rewl mig29 doesnt have as it is leveled with the wings, so thats 110% a copy caught on 4k***

creations-chat 2021-05-14 14:53:45 adding angles adds weight and takes engine space, i dun like either of those
creations-chat 2021-05-14 14:56:01 how does doing more motor locking reduce weight
creations-chat 2021-05-14 14:58:13 that adds drag, even worse than weight

creations-chat 2021-05-23 22:28:09 Cheese graters are my religion, hiding them is denying my faith

also motor locking them will either add drag or lag, or even worse will have exposed motor locc
creations-chat 2021-05-23 22:30:11 Drag
creations-chat 2021-05-23 22:33:40 Lies, literally cutting out 5 wings from an aircraft can boost its top speed by over 100 sps, adding more will cause it to slow down, and more wings **does not** equal more stability, longer aircraft are more stable and funny engines can also make aircraft more stable

Plus theres the space needed to hide the motor locc which is space that can be used for more engines and or weapons, and the risk of lag for having blocks clip into each other
creations-chat 2021-05-23 22:35:45 Skill issue

<@!711009848438947850> stacking hover drives causes cancer
creations-chat 2021-05-23 22:41:51 Safe to say my laptop is powerful enough to handle a near 3k sps fighter

But motor locking hover pads into each other causes the damn thing to lag to hell and back, ive tested it and its not worth the posible speed boost you can get from it

creations-chat 2021-06-20 20:34:54 If u cant mount them without ur wings colliding with them then id just remove em overall, looks weird like that and would fly poorly if u lifted them into their normal position

Not a bad jet tho, that one thing just bothered me a lot

creations-chat 2021-07-14 12:54:45 cant argue against that, but the shear amount of thrust youd need to get that thing up in the air at a reasonable speed will just add a hellish amount of lag on top of the lag that thing causes by just existing

events-chat 2022-01-16 20:25:07 Mech battles tend to be uninteresting bc theres little skill involved, and the controls for most mechs are too basic to make for an interesting fight
events-chat 2022-01-16 20:26:38 Plus theres the fact that most mechs in this battle would be modded tutorials or complete crap <:empty:794431705070174238>
events-chat 2022-01-16 20:27:56 Haha stick man slapped another stick man with a sword so funny haha
events-chat 2022-01-16 20:30:23 From what ive seen in public pvp, u literally just fly up to the other guy and swing first to win, or shoot ur rockets first, and these battles end in seconds

Not much opportunities to counter attack or effectively dodge
events-chat 2022-01-16 20:30:40 What everyone wants
events-chat 2022-01-16 20:33:02 Battle bot fights mimic irl battle bot fights, plus some bots can take multiple hits and its easier to dodge with them than most mechs in pain crazy

events-chat 2022-01-16 21:27:59 By eliminating a mechs ability to fly, this battle is gonna be even worse

Mfs gonna be slow as hell, have 0 chance to dodge, and bc theres no explosive blocks allowed there is basically no armor to defend against attacks

Legit gonna be 2 stick figures baby walking to each other and randomly swinging swords until a lucky hit is made that kills the other mech

events-chat 2022-01-18 06:33:40 Bring tank battles?

Tank battles tend to be quick, and depending on the performance of the tanks is either as boring as a snail gun fight or is as entertaining as an fps shooter

Planes are fun at all speeds as long as the maneuverability is there along it, and imo requires the most skill to be able to outmaneuver an enemy and score a killing blow

plus i know some ppl whove scripted cameras that track targets with 100% accuracy
events-chat 2022-01-27 05:43:08 guns deal very low damage in air, other than that <:OkayChamp:709084018485887096>
events-chat 2022-01-27 05:43:40 ive been playing this damn game for over 2 years, ive learned guns are ass unless ur going 20 sps
events-chat 2022-01-27 05:44:38 easy way to restrict speed is to ban all glitch engines and super rockets if u must
events-chat 2022-01-27 05:45:23 bruh anything weighing more than 50 blocks wont move

events-chat 2022-01-27 05:46:44 motor locking engines has its limits, fastest ive seen a super rocket plane go was 700 sps and speed restrictions are hard as hell to impose bc someone could be lying and secretly have a speed booster inside

events-chat 2022-01-29 21:42:24 ive done a blimp battle before (and won <:trollface:775024642104229898>) and all it is are slower planes with turrets and low gravity, or mini space ships 

its fun but planes, although less unique to this game, are more fun

https://youtu.be/-ZzEbjCdY5U
events-chat 2022-01-29 21:44:35 i wouldnt wanna do mach 3 jets, would be impossible to balance and would drag out the fights longer than dragon ball fights
events-chat 2022-01-29 21:45:32 only thing im not fond of wwi is no rockets, mainly bc time to kill with guns is long af
events-chat 2022-01-29 21:46:31 not a matter of aim, its a matter of u gotta hold guns for at least 10 seconds on a small maneuverable target to deal enough damage to disable a plane unless the enemy plane is motor locked out the wazoo

events-chat 2022-01-31 12:10:42 <@!757565064998944819> are you illiterate?
events-chat 2022-01-31 12:20:10 Not really, its simply unlocking the limitations of what normal mouse is capable of

Main pilot seat prevents the plane from full rotations when moved, and by removing it from the build via disconnectors to comply with the rules of this event then the seat would never move, allowing for full degrees of rotation

So its more an abuse of the games mechanics than it is a glitch
events-chat 2022-01-31 12:21:36 Hover engines suck at low speeds, and weather they are a glitch or not is difficult bc they work by pushing against blocks and you simply have to have a “lose” block on a build to push against
events-chat 2022-01-31 12:22:40 Ur better off switching to rockets bc if u shoot straight up you will lose a lot of speed, while rockets would not

events-chat 2022-01-31 12:42:19 Not my fault i cant make every shredder kill an insane shredder kill, they literally fly in a straight line to go kill a noob car or something like that
events-chat 2022-01-31 12:43:24 But i have gotten many skillful shredder kills in my vids <:OkayChamp:709084018485887096>

events-chat 2022-02-08 04:54:25 bc rbk always wins
events-chat 2022-02-08 04:56:06 considering that these planes are basically made of paper mache, speed is the only thing that will keep u alive
events-chat 2022-02-08 04:57:57 Shoot this block and the bi plane will lose its top wings and lose its flight characteristics
events-chat 2022-02-08 04:58:14 Shoot the landing gear and this plane is dead
events-chat 2022-02-08 04:58:51 Doof is most durable, 3 wings attached to the fuselage, and its the fastest so its harder to hit to begin with
events-chat 2022-02-08 04:59:39 and with some basic mods the doof can be very maneuverable
events-chat 2022-02-08 05:00:01 even more reason why the doof is the most survivable plane
events-chat 2022-02-08 05:00:40 no, u chose whatever u want, glitch mouse will allow the plane to do the bs in that vid
events-chat 2022-02-08 05:01:44 doof also has 2 engines, so if one gets yeeted ur still fine
events-chat 2022-02-08 05:02:01 lmao rip

events-chat 2022-02-17 02:23:42 Ive seen people blend normal mouse and glitched mouse, very complicated to pull off tho
events-chat 2022-02-17 02:31:21 Normal mouse is best for low speed combat, but struggles with stability and maneuverability with high speed

Glitched mouse is alright with low speed but dominates mid and high speed

And by attaching an anchored motor rig to ur main pilot seat you can switch between normal and glitched, but its hard to manage and makes it easier to destroy the main pilot seat xd

events-chat 2022-02-23 04:59:16 i have armor on my build, and motor locking blocks into each other doesnt make it "stronger" bc explosives have splash damage no matter what, and bullets go through everything like butter

only armor block resistant to both bullets and rockets are tnt blocks

creations-chat 2022-03-29 00:36:22 yeah but like think about it logically, it wont add any capabilities that the plane already doesnt have, and making a mouse guided missile on a mouse controlled plane would make the plane fly out of control when firing the missile, or id have to anchor it which is not pog

events-chat 2022-05-04 17:43:49 So a saw would have higher dps as it has more chances to touch the enemy, but that doesnt mean that chompers cant be as deadly, you just need to get a hold of the other guy to be able to deal the same dps

creations-chat 2022-06-26 04:31:35 Just because something is quick to build once you know and understand how it will work doesnt make it low effort dumbass

Low effort according to the mods would be a build lazily thrown together by a mf as a shit post

This isnt that, complain all you want about it being relatively simple but its not “low effort”

<@564463541248065547> most ppl who make custom jets just pull out a random letter and number pair out of their ass, and try hard to name it something cool

even professional companies suck at this, like the mfs behind ace combat thought "morgan" would be a cool name <:OmegaTroll:626841385118597152>

creations-chat 2022-08-22 01:51:37 i mean pc2 is meant to be a lot bigger, have like 20 players, have more blocks and tools for building, and be a lot less laggy

also wtf do u mean by skins? just paint ur build .-. 

also quests are a bit goofy for a sandbox game .-.

also having a dedicated pvp server is significantly better than a pvp arena bc that limits how and where u can pvp, and allows ppl to run away from a fight ._.
creations-chat 2022-08-22 01:57:04 all pc1 builds will port to pc2, meaning all the same building techniques will transfer over, u dont *have* to learn the new building stuffs being added to the game

summer ends in exactly one month in the netherlands, which is where rickje lives

<@728020153920520213> thats just lazy, also wouldnt work on motor locked builds ._.

<@410455661814480896> thats stupid, just learn to use the paint tool lmao
creations-chat 2022-08-22 01:59:53 if that happens a ton of players would be pissed off and not want to play pc2, so its in rickjes best interest to make sure all the regular shit like motor locking and glitched engines port over

Fire lasers bc why not

Be able to use its radar to track your balls from a hundred miles away while also mapping the terrain around it while being able to fire a missile behind itself while also acting as an AWACS while also acting as an electronic warfare suite all at once

Also drag is the best way to get rid of wobble, i will not explain how that works tho bc top secret <:trollface:775024642104229898> 

Plus the amount of weight reduction namnam goes through is useless considering a majority of planes in this game weight nothing, and it only reduces durability making everything out of trails and trap doors

Oh and most importantly 

**ITS THE SAME JET BUILT TO THE SAME SCALE WHICH ARE BOTH FOCUSED ON DETAILS**

creations-chat 2023-02-05 04:24:18 MOTOR LOCK WINGS INTO MY WINGS TO **ENHANCE PERFORMANCE**

motor locking adds lag and more wings adds drag

creations-chat 2023-02-05 04:27:52 it delivers my bombs fine, dont feel like rebuilding <:trollface:775024642104229898> 

<@937119057042358322> the bomber usually targets slow moving or still obkects, is not highly maneuverable and usually stays bellow 1k sps, i can afford the lag
the jet on the other hand is designed to be stable and maneuverable at speeds up to 4k sps so any additional lag can reduce its performance and cause more delay when fighting other players with jets of a similar performance
