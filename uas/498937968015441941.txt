creations-chat 2021-12-02 09:22:15 I got the day picks and stuff for ya. Aparently people really like this thing. Im scaring people aparently XD
creations-chat 2021-12-02 09:24:20 I know that but i have this audio saying "One day you will have to answer for your actions. And god. May not be so, Mercifull" And people are leaving the game for this! I cant make this up
creations-chat 2021-12-02 09:27:28 Nope! Its this dumb meme from "Cool bug facts!" Just look that up on youtube youll see what i mean. Also:
creations-chat 2021-12-02 09:30:21 Not really im using 2 speakers and playing it once. Also imma update the color scheme like you said since it is a lil bland.
creations-chat 2021-12-02 09:37:55 Is this a lil better?
creations-chat 2021-12-02 09:40:14 Sorry man! Here ya go tho

creations-chat 2021-12-02 10:26:50 I know my lil special time is over. But do you think that my build could maybe get a good amount of upvotes?
creations-chat 2021-12-02 10:30:21 Im getting ratioed in <#384025409945337856> 😭😭 😭 😭
creations-chat 2021-12-02 14:42:05 Aparently people do not like starring contest with tall and creepy things :<
creations-chat 2021-12-02 14:50:43 The downvotes are those who have a skill issue and cant win a single starring contest. So props to you chadinator 9000 😄
creations-chat 2021-12-02 22:23:33 Welp huggy wuggy didnt do as well as i thought it would
creations-chat 2021-12-04 08:31:32 I made the final upgrades and and touch up's to the Poppy playtime character. I will be making a showcase vid on it very soon. If there are any suggestions feel free to set em out to see.
creations-chat 2021-12-04 08:33:41 Me when
creations-chat 2021-12-04 08:37:37 Thx for the tip .-.
Gotta love pcc community eh?
creations-chat 2021-12-04 08:43:33 Imma get to wrok makin a showcase for this bad boy. It'll turn out well for sure.
creations-chat 2021-12-04 08:55:46 Thanks man
creations-chat 2021-12-04 08:58:40 Oh wait is it like the good kind of effort where you think its good and is nice. Or the kind of "E for effort" type thing?
creations-chat 2021-12-04 09:02:09 Damn didnt know it was bad
creations-chat 2021-12-04 09:14:56 This is gonna sound bad and almost petty, but i truly do think pcc is specific and Insufficient. No offense but a cliche tank could make hall over a floating city or something. Its all about demographic and what majority like's what. Its werid how it works.
creations-chat 2021-12-04 09:27:12 I only say this for two reasons and two reason alone. That being that pcc is mixed but has a greater group and the genuine sort of toxic standard that needs to be met. And no im not saying that there are no diverse and open builds in pcc hall. Im saying the build up is rather odd to me and how it flows.
creations-chat 2021-12-04 09:32:51 Noooo not at all. Im saying ive noticed a pattern amongst the group. The greater group on pcc is mostly realistic tanks, planes, and vehicles. Thats fairly prominant. Ive noticed how in this same majority there is a standard and specific ideas that need to be acomplished in order to stand out above the rest. Wether it be perfect shapes or pin point acurate desighns. its weird to me because id expect the cool lookin motor locked jet to fly high with suport, but as a double hand to the face its an ez beatdown of that builder. Either they will give constructive or all rounf just battery. Thats the pattern im talkin bout.
creations-chat 2021-12-04 09:35:47 Im really tempted now to explore this idea of how some favors fall into the right hands due to "majority rules" and kinda experiment with the pcc section for a interesting video.
creations-chat 2021-12-04 09:39:11 Basically the whole "majority rules" idea for pcc is almost broken over the top due to the random standards and ideas brought to the table. Its like a bunch of crabs in a bucket; if one tries to get out anf be free, it will usually get dragged back down by other crabs. Look up that metaphor i am not explaining it/
creations-chat 2021-12-04 09:41:13 That is true, but considering that the pattern and constant cases of "Good build not good enough" and "Funny meme" is a recurring thing here. i really want to make a deep dive on this now. This will be fun.
creations-chat 2021-12-04 09:43:36 It cant be majority rules if the majority is very much bigger than the lesser of groups(Not minorities this isnt history class). Also taking into acount the timing and probability of the post even being seen! Like a funni build would easily out weight a highly detailed build almost anyday. Which is so cool how that genuinly works!
creations-chat 2021-12-04 09:46:14 I mean im more hyped to make a in depth video on this idea. And ive got a ton of experiments to put to the test! Like if you check the whole realistic planes post. People tear each other apart for having exposed motors! Thats what i want to know about!
creations-chat 2021-12-04 09:48:26 I want to run a test. And ill find some builders for this, but i want to see if i can cherry pick from each main group set of plane crazy. And post them around the same time. Different people with different takes. And i just want to see how this would go if they all had the same timing, same advertising. And just genuine backlash or suport that will or should come.
creations-chat 2021-12-04 09:50:28 Oo you serve the perfect example of "Im bored so lets be an asshole" Type person. Wanna be in the vid as a sort of like,  example or variable? Id be happy to let you trash talk anyone for the video.
creations-chat 2021-12-04 09:52:40 No no im being genuinly serious. "In depth dive on Plane Crazy and its community: How groups can find resolve and start conflict" I really want to try this. If your down DM me
creations-chat 2021-12-04 09:55:14 Im sorry if it seems like that 6_6. Im not acting like anything... Im just saying words that are necessary. I wasnt acting like i was better. I know im not better than the person sitting next to me. i just got an idea and wanted to run with it. There an issue with that?
creations-chat 2021-12-04 09:57:28 Yknow when I was 10 I got molly whopped by a Spiderman belt buckle. I then realized i cant be normal again...
-._-.
creations-chat 2021-12-04 09:59:53 Also that is a fun video I loved making it. Make sure to smash like i had another out.  :>
creations-chat 2021-12-04 10:01:56 Oh yeah new vid tommorrow, or today, idek
creations-chat 2021-12-04 10:37:13 I honestly dont even know what I would want to do to make smaller or More teeth that look like the real deal. So imma just leave it there man.
creations-chat 2021-12-04 10:39:19 This is truly the best plane in history. /s
creations-chat 2021-12-04 10:43:01 -._-. 
Ok den.....
creations-chat 2021-12-04 10:45:08 It would be funny if someone would do this better with the same scale and everything yknow...
creations-chat 2021-12-04 10:48:32 Thats the idea. Cuz as of now on youtube we got stuff like this running around.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJQnD1-__EY
creations-chat 2021-12-04 10:53:04 Dang that really is a tons more better innit? /s
creations-chat 2021-12-04 10:56:22 Thats sarcasm -_-

-Shark
creations-chat 2021-12-04 11:15:18 This statement is 100 percent truthfull and is so true.
creations-chat 2021-12-04 11:18:12 Bro the fact skill can be outplayed by brain ded shredder bug isnt unfair, it just means the pro builder is bad at the game.
creations-chat 2021-12-04 11:21:51 I might touch on that in my in depth dive when it comes together. Cuz its so funny that your jet means nothing since a tutorial will easily be able to out match a battle ready vehicle.
creations-chat 2021-12-04 21:33:08 Thats  a build
creations-chat 2021-12-05 13:18:29 Yis
creations-chat 2021-12-05 13:28:09 Ill see what i can do. I do have a trailer on my channel and ill be doin a showcase on its transformation soon.
creations-chat 2021-12-05 13:30:28 Ill put this here the build is one.
This is a bad laptop.
And ill just have to send screenshot till i can show it in a video thats short enough to fit discord.
Gimme one sec.
creations-chat 2021-12-05 13:32:31 I can see why you guys seem sus and i didn't think that part through. I assure you the truck become the robot and the robot become the truck. Ill get those mid transformation screenshots for you after the cool down is done I swear.
creations-chat 2021-12-05 13:39:56 Omg this is gonna sound so sus. But i was loaded in and the damn thing glitched the hell out and crashed my game so hard. I need like 5 minutes for this thing to buffer.

creations-chat 2022-01-25 06:32:19 I know the legs look wonky rn but they just need a one set motor lock to fit em in place. But here thes body so far. And yes ill get to ideas on how to get those eyes right

creations-chat 2022-04-19 16:08:58 That's not an opinion kid. And giga is wayyyyyy different.
creations-chat 2022-04-19 16:10:46 
creations-chat 2022-04-19 16:14:39 Bro I legit said fleet is dumb... Basically your fragile ego wanted an ego boost by trash talking someone you don't like. Plus I asked if I should paint the trex to look like yoshi. The stupidity is strong with this one. Oh yeah here's a giga:
creations-chat 2022-04-19 16:21:10 Yeah. And the jw trex looks nothing like the accurate rexes we were gonna have prior to the redesign JP launched. Also I will be trying to sculpt the back of the ehad and top of the eys more since the snout on this rex is new. I remolded from the older one.
creations-chat 2022-04-19 16:22:52 Yeahh I tried to clor it to be as close to slate as possible. It's hard. Also fleet doesn't like me since he got dawged on in a server by everyone one time.
creations-chat 2022-04-19 16:25:25 I'm gonna have to dis agree with that. Since the giga has a different head shape. And you can't see the head well since I took the pics from weird angles. But it resembles more of the trex head than the giga
creations-chat 2022-04-19 16:27:53 That I can live with. Also the giga just has more angled ridges then my trex. The eye arcs will get the work in on em since I have the crest done. But yeah
creations-chat 2022-04-19 16:29:35 This just triggered a flight or fight response after I realized that the teeth and brush were flipped...

creations-chat 2022-06-28 10:09:41 What build is this dude talking about again?? I just wanna know
creations-chat 2022-06-28 10:13:37 <@927145074867978240>  you got only 19 downvotes.... 
You chose to actively insult people giving tips and play victim to the "toxic community".
Dawg it's just a skill issue with one's self.
creations-chat 2022-06-28 10:15:56 This community sucks yeah, but if you mess with the fire you get burned. Try not to involve yourself with other people dawg. Opinions are opinions and you arnt suppose to build for the likes of people.
creations-chat 2022-06-28 10:25:39 Bro this server got terrible standards. Like if people just stopped caring about what others think, lower skilled builders would not have such a hard time. And btw just cuz you got ranks doesn't mean you can talk crap to no ranks. It's petty and and a low ego to drag someone for not enough detail and then shield any comebacks with "I'm an expert".
creations-chat 2022-06-28 10:29:45 Hey don't think I'm 100 percent defending you here. I'm defending you cuz everyone is just dragging you rn. All I'm saying is that the toxic realistic standards and detail freaks are gonna kill this game and it's newer players.
creations-chat 2022-06-28 10:32:50 I say that cuz you were so ready to just clap back at legit anyone. Your not entirely innocent dawg.
Consider it a helping hand
creations-chat 2022-06-28 10:38:36 Yeah. <@660019099430289418>  I think people with more of an image should at least try to make this place better for newer builders. And by god; drop the idea that ilr vehicles need to be 100 percent accurate and photo realistic.
creations-chat 2022-06-28 10:44:10 Imma say this rn. Creations can be biased as h-e- double hockey sticks bruh. The majority of builds in this game is irl vehicle's, so if you ain't making that you need a good excuse not to. For example making a really good giant build, or a troll excepted build. Trust me if your build is good to you and a couple others agree, there will be a solid amount of people to say otherwise. It's sad that toxic idiots and trolls are a loud group.
<@900649045813493810>
creations-chat 2022-06-28 10:47:52 <@927145074867978240>  stop saying this community is so toxic bruh. Your just as bad in your comments being made. There may be a illogical balance of bad opinions, but there is a very visible line one who's a top builder and who's getting their bearings.
creations-chat 2022-06-28 10:50:56 I love how a carrot got up there lmao. Oh yeah <@660019099430289418> what you think of my mystery machine from Scooby Doo 2
creations-chat 2022-06-28 10:53:52 I think white names get bad rep from the sensitive newer players. Some are just not yet ranked and they get thrashed for doing so.
Also I don't got a huge ego :(
creations-chat 2022-06-28 10:56:02 I alr did. 
Nvm you mean like your genuine profile, not what's in it. Mb
creations-chat 2022-06-28 10:59:11 @Mighty_Potato23  how did you get the color for your name aka ranks? Like the color rank.
creations-chat 2022-06-28 11:03:58 Thank guys for the colors thing you guys are Chad. Also Jenga is only impossible cuz plane crazy got fard physics...

creations-chat 2022-06-28 11:10:08 Ah, good to know! 👍
creations-chat 2022-06-28 11:13:46 People are weird in this game. Cuz they will happily downvotes and trash someone since they don't like a build, but when it happens with them they blame the world and explain how "We live in a society that abandons them and treats them like trash"
creations-chat 2022-06-28 11:17:00 Bro imma be real this games toxic side and troll worthy nature has killed the hype for pc2. At least for me. Gate keeping gotta stop homie.
Wait he left cuz he got ratioed? @mighty_potato23

creations-chat 2022-06-28 12:18:04 Yeah people gotta let go. Bums with bad take or just toxic takes are legit words on a screen at the end of the day. Yeah I said bums bit me.
Not you tho vincen
creations-chat 2022-06-28 12:45:03 Ong
creations-chat 2022-06-28 13:01:35 Lower skill creations get it good, irl vehicle's need to be photo realistic and accurate, you need to be perfect, you need to be troll worthy, etc. Standards are all over the place and it's all because of the wrong opinions man.
creations-chat 2022-06-28 13:08:05 Preach

creations-chat 2022-07-09 07:35:48 Man they are all the same. They talk crap here then try to gang up, then when we get this game taken home it's all of a sudden rude remarks and awfully comebacks. Not to mention they just cower at the fact they can't just talk using our words. Civilly mind you!
