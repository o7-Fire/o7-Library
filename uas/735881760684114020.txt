creations-chat 2022-08-03 17:30:16 thank you
creations-chat 2022-08-03 17:33:49 any ideas on what detail i could add? looking at the plane itself idk what to put on it
creations-chat 2022-08-03 17:51:22 i am looking at the real thing i cant see anything to add apart from tiny little dots
help 2022-08-03 20:14:38 can anyone tell me some really good plane crazy designers so i can get some inspiration?
creations-chat 2022-08-04 10:20:01 Well pretty much people put on a circus show for us
creations-chat 2022-08-04 10:22:03 Good point, people are talking about it like it will definitely come out then
creations-chat 2022-08-04 10:25:42 Ok well ngl that Bismarck that the person can‚Äôt finish looks pretty amazing
creations-chat 2022-08-04 10:28:09 Yeah if we just tell people their builds are bad enough they‚Äôll never come back!!!!!! (We uh, want that right?)
creations-chat 2022-08-04 10:30:12 Fr how dare they be bad at something they don‚Äôt fully understand yet

<@401530469952389130> True true, an expert channel would be a genius idea
creations-chat 2022-08-04 10:32:25 Looking back at my old creations pain me, I‚Äôm still terrible at the game but I was so bad before...
creations-chat 2022-08-04 10:34:42 The one whitename who just takes the ‚Äúfeedback‚Äù and tries to improve:

<@744591826891046943> Ngl I was nearly that one whitename but I kind of just never updated the plane
creations-chat 2022-08-04 10:37:11 Ngl that should be in hall of fame and be a contest winner wow!!!
help 2022-08-04 10:38:23 Normal motor, but the better solution is to just make the blades aesthetic and use tiny propellers to control the heli (rotors are pain)
creations-chat 2022-08-04 10:46:59 Panzerfaust is about to become canon fodder
help 2022-08-04 10:48:07 It is possible but it kinda just relies on you not pressing the buttons whilst your in the main pilot seat, you could give yourself like an on and off switch, someone with more knowledge might know
creations-chat 2022-08-04 10:49:55 Uhhhhh, true, it‚Äôs double canon fodder then
help 2022-08-08 13:46:20 Why do my rockets not track, no matter what settings i use, they dont track
help 2022-08-08 15:45:15 .
help 2022-08-08 15:45:55 Anyone got any feedback to make this UAV a bit better?
help 2022-08-08 15:46:14 
help 2022-08-08 15:48:39 i was tryna challenge myself to make something that isnt real
help 2022-08-08 15:49:36 its pretty stable vertically its actually less stable horizontally lol
help 2022-08-08 15:49:52 also because of the trapdoors i cant do a vertical stabiliser easily
help 2022-08-08 15:51:21 its just unstable because of the speed mainly tbh
help 2022-08-08 15:51:29 at low speed it flies amazingly
help 2022-08-08 15:52:15 ill try that
help 2022-08-08 15:56:47 that helped a little bit
help 2022-08-08 16:07:37 yeah then im using control surfaces for the roll because m2m didnt fit the wings

contest-chat 2022-08-10 15:44:56 we need that
creations-chat 2022-08-11 21:38:37 As a whitename I second this
creations-chat 2022-08-11 21:40:43 Touch sea
creations-chat 2022-08-11 21:43:16 Uh ok you make a good point but if you just lean down (make sure you‚Äôre precariously hanging over a rail) then try and touch the water (ensure you are doing it near the propeller) then when you mysteriously fall and get your arm chopped off I will not take the blame
creations-chat 2022-08-11 21:46:59 Oh that‚Äôs not good, I hope the taste isn‚Äôt salty for too long, I also think that whitename should do research on the basic concept of having interests

Also why does no one like the sea vixen

THE ONLY BAD PART IS THE COCKPIT

NO !!!!! YOU CANT HAVE A DIFFERENT OPINION TO ME !!!!!!
creations-chat 2022-08-11 21:49:33 Omg I agree well done good opinion

That‚Äôs theoretically impossible due to the fact you are also made of carbon and to do that you would probably be in a situation where you die to, therefore doing what federal wants
creations-chat 2022-08-11 21:52:40 True, also it should have bombs because a10

<@847981335078895680> is that even possible

Idk it‚Äôs just such a small space

creations-chat 2022-08-11 22:00:53 Hardly ever see non 1 wide planes that people actually like tbh
creations-chat 2022-08-11 22:03:17 Yeeeeeee how dare you have yur own apinion!!!!!!
creations-chat 2022-08-11 22:05:41 Isn‚Äôt like the whole point of this channel to judge the creations so that we help the person make them better? Or is this just ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like it‚Äù ‚ÄúOMG HOW DAR YUUUUUU!!!!!!‚Äù
creations-chat 2022-08-11 22:08:23 It should be, join plane crazy, oh yeah this is quite toxic, not, wait omg plane crazy community is toxic how did I not realise, isn‚Äôt obvious from the people who slander you in game for tiny things?

<@365515326550573078> that rafale is not okie dokie
creations-chat 2022-08-11 22:12:36 It actually, Uhm, proves that, Uhm, older builds were less good because, Uhm, they had less features in the game, Uhm

@Mr.SlowFood#1251 yup, basically sums it up
creations-chat 2022-08-11 22:15:11 The whole existence of creations is so the creations get judged if you can‚Äôt cope with them being judged then just don‚Äôt post, it‚Äôs as simple as that
creations-chat 2022-08-11 22:17:35 I gotta agree with that one ngl
creations-chat 2022-08-11 22:19:50 This one slaps hard, especially with the small prop engines
creations-chat 2022-08-11 22:22:23 ‚ÄúLike my roscale mech?‚Äù
creations-chat 2022-08-11 22:28:22 Warned for trying to send like 10 emojis, what a L move from me
creations-chat 2022-08-11 22:30:46 ‚ÄúGuys I tried out motor lock what do you think?‚Äù
creations-chat 2022-08-11 22:34:23 I wonder if there is a single person in this world who can make a gloster javelin look good

The gloster javelin is one of Britain‚Äôs ugly Cold War jets
creations-chat 2022-08-11 22:36:41 You ever heard of raf duxford? They have a target livery javelin there and it‚Äôs amazing because it is used for what that monster deserves, being shot at
creations-chat 2022-08-11 22:40:13 The giant scribbles really mask the disgusting horror under neath ngl
creations-chat 2022-08-11 22:42:28 Is uh, that thing meant to be an osprey?
