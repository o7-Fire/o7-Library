The Tale of bluesandbox (393590894387003404)
help 2020-12-03 22:20:33 im trying to make a turret and i need this hinge to make the barrel longer, but placing the motor down causes everything to wobble
help 2020-12-03 22:21:06 up down left right are fine before the motor (both axis are motor 2 things so it follows your curser)
help 2020-12-03 22:32:44 maybe
help 2020-12-03 22:32:58 but why does placing down a motor at the top of the barrel cause it to wobble
help 2020-12-03 22:33:34 oh and its not just wobbling, its like it dosnt have the energy to get all the way up as well
help 2020-12-03 22:34:13 it only does it when the motor is there though
help 2020-12-03 22:35:44 its perfectly fine when it has no motor on the hinge, when i add the motor it flops
help 2020-12-03 22:35:51 that makes it worse
help 2020-12-03 22:35:55 it wont even move then
help 2020-12-03 22:36:05 i tried adding helium to the end and it wont move now
help 2020-12-03 22:36:32 lemme get a video of it
help 2020-12-03 22:38:11 no hinge
help 2020-12-03 22:38:19 hinge

help 2020-12-03 22:39:36 now how am i going to add a barrel to this
help 2020-12-03 22:40:04 that is a motor fold
help 2020-12-03 22:40:09 its whats breaking it
help 2020-12-03 22:40:34 oh
help 2020-12-03 22:40:44 lemme see if it being powered or not does anything
help 2020-12-03 22:41:38 its all at base speed and torque
help 2020-12-03 22:42:37 what the up and down motors?
help 2020-12-03 22:43:54 oh
help 2020-12-03 22:44:13 i havnt even been using it, just having it exist is what breaks it
help 2020-12-03 22:46:14 hmm
help 2020-12-03 22:47:43 it still breaks even with unpowered motors i think
help 2020-12-03 22:48:16 yeah its still broken if the motor is unpowered
help 2020-12-03 22:48:22 actually lemme relog

help 2020-12-04 16:16:35 im probably doing this completely wrong, but im trying to make a motor lock but it dosnt pull anything into the blocks, just to the top of them
help 2020-12-04 16:16:46 
help 2020-12-04 16:17:29 that works
help 2020-12-04 16:17:30 thanks
help 2020-12-04 16:35:53 is there any way to fit guns and rockets into these barrels with motor locks or something
help 2020-12-04 16:37:48 the thickest part is 3x3
help 2020-12-04 16:37:58 i used 0.9 blocks to fit the square part into the turret so they could move
help 2020-12-04 16:38:24 how
help 2020-12-04 16:42:47 oof
help 2020-12-04 16:43:15 i think ill make it less round to fit a motor lock in
help 2020-12-04 16:49:47 i have a space but how can i put the motor lock in without the sides sticking to the motor bases and stoping them from working
help 2020-12-04 16:51:57 sure
help 2020-12-04 16:53:08 oh i think i figured something out
help 2020-12-04 16:53:13 kinda
help 2020-12-04 16:58:58 <@!486276884611465256> i think just having 3 of the cylinders being squarish vs having a section would be weird looking
help 2020-12-04 17:05:59 <@486276884611465256> sorry power went out for a sec
