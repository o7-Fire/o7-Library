the-dump 2022-07-19 16:30:08 Watch out for this dude
the-dump 2022-07-19 16:59:57 My old account got banned for saying shi
the-dump 2022-07-19 17:00:03 The full word
the-dump 2022-07-19 17:00:23 Bro that game was stupid for disabling tags ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ðŸ’€
the-dump 2022-07-20 15:00:43 This looks weird, but once u start understanding how it works, u will see
the-dump 2022-07-20 15:00:50 The red balls are the explosive
the-dump 2022-07-20 15:01:07 The green is the magnet
the-dump 2022-07-20 15:01:27 Blue is to block the barrel, so the explosive ball doesn't fall off
the-dump 2022-07-20 15:01:38 How this works is with the help of gravity, the red balls fall
the-dump 2022-07-20 15:01:59 The green box was supposed to be at the back
the-dump 2022-07-20 15:02:12 Accidentally put it under the explosive balls
the-dump 2022-07-20 15:03:25 Once an explosive is Infront of the magnet, it will start pushing, then once I wanna shoot, a piston should put the blue box down
the-dump 2022-07-20 15:03:30 Forcing the ball to exit
the-dump 2022-07-20 15:19:52 Nvm no one's gonna understand the concept, I'll just make it tommorow
the-dump 2022-07-20 15:21:41 Where else can I send images
