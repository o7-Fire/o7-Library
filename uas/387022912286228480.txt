creations-chat 2021-01-18 03:39:09 opinions on this so far?
creations-chat 2021-01-18 03:41:10 its diamond plate, any other material i can use? (its all metal) I could use ladders, but they are wedges, bruhs <:WeirdChamp:670867805176070145>
creations-chat 2021-01-18 03:53:55 Changed the color to a more "60's" yellow. Also, yes, I will change the engines, I also thought they were rather small.
creations-chat 2021-01-18 03:55:55 Like, just make them bigger, or like change the shape and make them bigger?
creations-chat 2021-01-18 04:01:41 Alright, fixed the wings, I can still adjust them if needed. Now I need to work on the engines.
creations-chat 2021-01-18 04:03:42 Like, keep them the same size but change it up, or make it bigger? I need more context, sorry.
creations-chat 2021-01-18 04:09:37 What about the part in the middle?
creations-chat 2021-01-18 04:13:20 I tried to use half blocks but it looked way too blocky. Why do I see a motor lock running towards me-
creations-chat 2021-01-18 04:15:22 Alright lol, cya, and thank you.
creations-chat 2021-01-18 04:19:54 Alright, motor lock F1 engine. By the way, the lower wedges are 1x2 half wedges.
creations-chat 2021-01-18 04:28:27 Opinions on the new F1 engine? (It uses motor locking)
creations-chat 2021-01-18 04:30:39 Anyone?
creations-chat 2021-01-18 04:45:48 oh lord lol

creations-chat 2021-01-18 05:12:43 No opinions on my rocket so far still? bruh <:what:644996672048463942> <:WeirdChamp:670867805176070145>  i came here to get opinions so i can make it good
creations-chat 2021-01-18 05:22:56 My whole pc turned off for some reason, but anyways, thank you autosave for saving me my time by helping me not rage
creations-chat 2021-01-18 15:46:27 Opinions? It isn't done, just about a quarter of the first stage left but still. Also, the panels did have lettering but you know how plane crazy signs are :/
creations-chat 2021-01-18 15:51:28 Well, I mean, I don't know what to do because my friend here said they look better like that but I don't know. I can just put panels inside the rocket so it doesn't flip over.
creations-chat 2021-01-18 16:10:46 Any opinions before I start building the 2nd stage? And no, I haven't added the little decoupler ring between the 1st and 2nd stage.
creations-chat 2021-01-18 16:13:42 How could I change them?
creations-chat 2021-01-18 16:24:34 fixed the upper paint job
creations-chat 2021-01-18 16:37:07 They are a block thick. But hold on, I'll see what I can do with it longer.
creations-chat 2021-01-18 17:53:48 So, I increased the height on my Saturn V 1st stage.. and...
creations-chat 2021-01-18 17:58:11 pfft, in what way does your gender change the outcome?

creations-chat 2021-01-19 00:22:37 well, everyone appears to have built quite literally everything.

i see no purpose in building after i get done with this Saturn V because if i even try to build something else, someone has to be a showoff and say "hey i already built that noob"

creations-chat 2021-01-26 10:01:35 So, I have come to my conclusions to even scaling the astronauts to the Apollo Lunar Lander. THIS is to scale. Makes we wonder HOW MANY OTHER THINGS I BUILT THAT AREN'T TO SCALE. also: this model is not detailed because i just wanted to see if i could actually get the scale right..
creations-chat 2021-01-26 10:03:42 The head height to the lander is very similar I must say. https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/483990499972087839/803565719555276811/5931.png

creations-chat 2021-02-01 12:16:51 omg i just spent all night building a rocket, only for it to not dock to the lander thus defeating the purpose of the rocket and i think i just had a stroke a few minutes ago im literally sweating jesus
creations-chat 2021-02-01 12:18:53 thanks to the devs of this game only like blocking your view with only fog, theres a glitch where motor locking kills magnets, im literally going to bash my head into a wall
creations-chat 2021-02-01 12:20:58 go cover yourself in oil, and im a decent builder (nah im pretty terrible g), hey, at least i aint the one building off of tutorials lol <:trollface:775024642104229898>
creations-chat 2021-02-01 12:22:58 no, i didnt say you were, i was talking about the public servers, those tutorials, they scare me, those children who say no and yes to anything, the shredders.. my god..
creations-chat 2021-02-01 12:25:00 it doesnt move and glitch out, it appears normal, but they just dont connect once i press the button
bug-reports 2021-02-01 12:26:14 Hello, I want to make a report of magnets being corrupted by motor locking / folding.

My Saturn V, which is a rocket, has a docking method to dock to the Moon lander, well, when I detach the covering, the magnets won't react when I press the buttons.
bug-reports 2021-02-01 12:30:15 In the first image, you can see this docks, I tested this on both space crafts, they worked.
bug-reports 2021-02-01 12:31:21 However, when I try to dock to the lander, it completely just decides to not dock, and YES it's in a 20 block radius of the magnets. Also, the magnets are hidden, maybe that could be why? But on my old Saturn V, they were not hidden and still didn't dock.
bug-reports 2021-02-01 12:32:50 Just because of this one glitch, it has wasted hours of building this, I have took all night and half a day to build this, but god forbid the magnets work.
bug-reports 2021-02-01 15:39:15 bruh, that is what its on
bug-reports 2021-02-01 16:00:33 i have weld and toggle on

creations-chat 2021-03-30 17:14:45 actually, i just built a base before this one and it worked fine, i even tested it again so it's not roblox's 'fixed' physics. well i mean it doesnt work fine like something you'd see made by some god at the game.

bug-reports 2021-04-01 23:31:09 I've noticed with my Saturn V rockets, when I dock with the LM the magnets never work, they use the SAME KEYBINDS don't even ask that again please, they have weld on and they are on max strength. It never welds / works. Yet when I put on a motor 2 which sorta destroys the rocket, docking with magnets work.
bug-reports 2021-04-01 23:32:34 <:trollface:775024642104229898>
bug-reports 2021-04-01 23:32:41 lmao
bug-reports 2021-04-01 23:54:48 oh wait, so just weld breaks it
bug-reports 2021-04-01 23:54:56 interesting..
bug-reports 2021-04-01 23:55:48 no wait i mean i found that "magnets only" breaks it
bug-reports 2021-04-02 00:24:42 But then when I put an unlocked motor to replace the Motor 2 which breaks it, it doesn't break the rocket too much and I'm able to use magnets... very interesting.

bug-reports 2021-07-06 14:13:06 And it just happens on some save files, not all.
bug-reports 2021-07-06 14:13:51 Doesn't happen in any other game.
bug-reports 2021-07-06 14:29:07 No.
bug-reports 2021-07-06 14:29:15 I meant something just falling into the void.
bug-reports 2021-07-06 14:29:38 Yes.
bug-reports 2021-07-06 14:30:34 Yeah, at least it doesn't happen to my bigger builds.

bug-reports 2021-07-12 18:47:20 I've notice when splashing down in my capsules that sometimes parachutes decide to have an actual seizure.
bug-reports 2021-07-12 18:48:29 And basically your build decides to be like a gmod prop inside of another gmod prop. We all know what happens then.
bug-reports 2021-07-12 18:52:09 Must be due to the drag.
bug-reports 2021-07-12 18:52:38 Based on bugs I've seen, apparently fabric wing panels don't like existing either. So they both have drag and they're both fabric, could be the same.

creations-chat 2021-08-17 20:01:11 the rocket im currently building seems to be good for all requirements for the top rank of rocket scientist, though if there is one part im confused about is the 4th requirement. what i mean is, the launch pad separates from the rocket allowing it to take off but would this be a problem? not to mention the stages, fairings, and the two stage lander.
creations-chat 2021-08-17 20:03:19 that's the thing they separate when the times comes to do that, it pretty much just gets smaller until it's just one capsule that returns back

creations-chat 2021-08-23 09:42:23 wow, the totally real beluga, not scamming or anything also they got banned instantly
then again beluga's content kinda trash from what ive watched, its all staged.
creations-chat 2021-08-23 09:46:21 yeah it doesnt even take much to find out, you just know it.
creations-chat 2021-08-23 10:30:49 both crafts docked, they both have interiors as well + a 1x3 docking hatch covered into a 1x2 docking hatch to allow horizontal docking as seen here.
creations-chat 2021-08-23 10:33:03 ikr, im pretty proud of it so far
creations-chat 2021-08-23 10:59:50 lol, looking good ngl, a lot of effort went into your rocket you built there
creations-chat 2021-08-23 11:09:38 also ive been checking the fairing / lem extraction jettisons, and they're very smooth, i legit said "this is the ultimate saturn v" and yes i know that's an exaggeration
im just really happy with this rocket
creations-chat 2021-08-23 11:11:53 lol, you just gotta take it smooth, dont rush.

creations-chat 2021-08-23 11:55:44 now i can start attaching super rocket engines to this thing and hoping it flys at 180 g lol
creations-chat 2021-08-23 12:00:12 well, this is my fourth one and ive spent three days on now, currently adding propulsion to it to make it fly.
creations-chat 2021-08-23 12:02:18 nah i wont, i've already added the propulsion for the two spacecrafts. just a matter of spamming super rocket engines and putting wing panels in the 1st and 2nd stage.
creations-chat 2021-08-23 12:04:40 you too.
creations-chat 2021-08-23 12:08:30 damn, 10,416 parts at the moment with propulsion in all the stages. i might not add the tower for lag purposes.

creations-chat 2021-08-24 02:26:52 thanks to some c-130 and tall pencil like SLS rocket, this picture ended being really small
creations-chat 2021-08-24 02:29:34 no, thats one mistake i made on every creation ive posted in the pcc. the god like launch escape system as it sits in front of the sun.
creations-chat 2021-08-24 02:32:39 i mean for one i would probably have to do it in a streamable video, pictures dont do it well
creations-chat 2021-08-24 02:37:39 One giant sets, and another gets ready to rise.
creations-chat 2021-08-24 02:40:04 thanks
creations-chat 2021-08-24 02:42:09 it already meets the requirements, last thing i need to get is either a cinematic video of this or some screenshots. i'll go with cinematic, it's just cooler in my opinion instead of having 20 different pictures in <#384025409945337856> lol.
creations-chat 2021-08-24 02:44:21 lmfao, what if instead of putting "The Saturn V" on my saturn v post in creations i just say "The Shitfuck V"
creations-chat 2021-08-24 02:47:29 editing and getting actual good shots of the rocket is gonna be a pain
creations-chat 2021-08-24 02:50:10 i guess i should get to recording this, i dont know how im gonna get these shots besides pointing some cameras at one object and hoping they look good, thinking of synth music in the background with a nice beat
creations-chat 2021-08-24 11:56:57 what is with <#384025409945337856> and why wont it let me post two streamable vids

the-dump 2021-08-31 09:44:57 i HATE furries
the-dump 2021-08-31 09:45:22 almost every experience ive had with furries is just awkward as hell, there are some good ones but they arent the adult ones.
the-dump 2021-08-31 09:46:31 no i meant the under 18 ones are fine, its just the adults that are awkward as hell
the-dump 2021-08-31 09:47:22 what i mean is, you shouldnt be speaking like a brain dead donkey when you're a fully grown adult
the-dump 2021-08-31 09:48:09 dont get me started on how much no no drawings they have
the-dump 2021-08-31 09:48:16 they have the most no no drawings of ANY fandom

the-dump 2021-08-31 09:54:41 true
the-dump 2021-08-31 09:56:29 the problem with brain dead furries is that they arent confronted

creations-chat 2021-12-13 09:05:20 the thing is, i cant have the bottom half of the lower horizontal stabilizer because then i wouldnt be able to take off or taxi for that matter. and no im not gonna build an entire other aircraft just to lift it as this thing has already been upscaled but i do have half of the lower horizontal stabilizer

creations-chat 2021-12-14 06:30:51 wow bro nice feedback
creations-chat 2021-12-14 06:32:58 im all for criticism and stuff but this is what i mean with the pcc, you come in expecting a nice community that will welcome your builds, but instead you're greeted with "delete" 100 times over until you finally give up and actually leave.
creations-chat 2021-12-14 06:35:54 fr, like bro, the amount of people who have left this community could've became well known builders but instead they leave because more than half of this community doesnt know how to give actual constructive criticism. hell, i dont even know how to criticize constructively
creations-chat 2021-12-14 06:39:14 its not even about if your overly sensitive or not, most people dont want to be in a community with a bunch of douchebags
creations-chat 2021-12-14 06:41:18 there is a reason we celebrate the ban of skilletrocks2016 lmao, and if you know, you know.
creations-chat 2021-12-14 06:44:07 that's kinda just apart of every community really, cant really change that. also, what i meant by skillet is how she was such a bitch when it came to criticizing a build. she once called someone a minor for building poorly, you could check the message logs though it would be quite hard to do so with her being banned and no longer having an @ in this server.
creations-chat 2021-12-14 06:46:10 idk, but she would bitch about someone's build when her builds were worse and then she would copy the builds she just talked shit about.
creations-chat 2021-12-14 06:48:27 i do miss building for fun
creations-chat 2021-12-14 06:50:31 thats when i joined the pcc, then it became more of a dread than it did an actual hobby, nowadays i find myself playing pc for 10 minutes with half of that time just being me browsing discord before finally leaving
