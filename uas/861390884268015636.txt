creations-chat 2023-07-05 10:11:07 Hey do you guys ever feel like “The F-106 was designed as the so-called "Ultimate Interceptor" as a consequence of the 1954 interceptor program of the early 1950s. It was a development of the F-102 Delta Dagger, and thus was originally designed as the F-102B prior to being redesignated by the United States Air Force (USAF). The F-106 was designed without a gun or provision for carrying bombs, instead carrying its AIM-4 Falcon air-to-air missiles within an internal weapons bay, its clean exterior was beneficial to supersonic flight. Major differences from the F-102 included the adoption of the more powerful Pratt & Whitney J75 turbojet engine, heavily redesigned air inlets along with a variable-geometry inlet duct to suit a wide range of supersonic speeds, application of the area rule to the fuselage shaping, and a general increase in size. On 26 December 1956, the first prototype performed its maiden flight. After flight testing demonstrated less performance gains than anticipated, the USAF ultimately only ordered 350 of the planned 1,000 F-106s once planned” sometimes or is it just me?
