creations-chat 2022-06-02 03:44:36 well the front and rear wheels dont really do anything so i made them ice so that when they collide with something they dont create a lot of friction that slows me down since they dont spin

bug-reports 2022-11-27 04:53:52 ok it seems that if I hold the locking key for a while instead of letting it go as soon as the stuff is in place then the lock will stay
bug-reports 2022-11-27 11:57:48 you gotta place them on a certain side then sorround it with something like signs
