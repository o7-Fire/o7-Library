help 2022-11-10 23:48:18 Is it possible to get an infinite block amount in plane crazy? I'm making a large mechanical build and I know I will run out of the text blocks. is there any way to get more than 200 each? thanks.
help 2022-11-10 23:51:13 really? i saw a build on youtube where somebody exceeded the limit
help 2022-11-10 23:52:36 Well, I'm damned then, unless I use 1x2's with 1x3's I won't be able to use any more text blocks which are very important for their properties Rip
help 2022-11-10 23:57:37 what other things?
help 2022-11-10 23:58:25 hmm
help 2022-11-10 23:58:57 I don't use text blocks because they are invisible in my builds, its because they don't have any collisions which is important
help 2022-11-10 23:59:40 Want me to DM you a pic?
help 2022-11-10 23:59:49 I can't send an image here  yet
help 2022-11-11 00:48:24 Wdym?
help 2022-11-11 00:48:51 I'll try that
help 2022-11-11 00:49:35 I made some of the text blocks wood, but it still says the same amount of text blocks have been used
help 2022-11-11 00:50:55 that might just work for standard blocks
help 2022-11-11 00:50:58 only
help 2022-11-11 00:51:28 I try to avoid that for this reason:
help 2022-11-23 20:13:51 Anybody know how to make an efficient differential design? My differential isn't strong enough and makes the car slower
creations-chat 2023-04-09 02:33:25 <@895654694926557214> Why did you steal Fainted's miniature trophy truck showcase and post it in creations?
creations-chat 2023-04-09 02:38:50 Not my showcase, but my theory is that it allows it to slide around corners easier hence why the tires are the default material instead of fabric. Also it would be nearly impossible to fit a wishbone suspension system in the amount of space available (Also forgot to mention the motors which allow the wheels to spin freely would scrape the ground because the wheels are the same size as the motors)
creations-chat 2023-04-09 03:42:18 I believe it was taken from this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvGYMSC96TE&ab_channel=_Fainted_
creations-chat 2023-04-09 04:41:00 Why haven't the moderators taken any action against the copier? The post is still up on <#384025409945337856>

help 2023-05-25 15:43:50 <@489806344388345857> I would be more than happy to show you some of my current builds but unfortunately I do not have image perms
help 2023-05-25 15:51:56 Wrong pic lol

help 2023-05-25 15:54:10 And before you start criticizing that it is only an engine, this was made for speed and fun not complexity. I actually only made it to test a new engine I made for <@944981545834409984>
help 2023-05-25 15:55:20 I also made it in 1-2 days
help 2023-05-25 15:59:57 Him or my car?

help 2023-05-25 17:00:32 How?
help 2023-05-25 17:00:47 There isn't even a gearbox lmao
help 2023-05-25 17:01:23 It's a boxer 8 hover piston engine
help 2023-05-25 17:03:03 It's direct drive
help 2023-05-25 17:03:12 1:1
help 2023-05-25 17:03:30 It's probably faster than Evan's FXX
help 2023-05-25 17:03:49 It does 0-300 in like 3 seconds
help 2023-05-25 17:03:51 Ask <@944981545834409984>
help 2023-05-25 17:04:31 And Evan's FXX isn't even hover piston powered
help 2023-05-25 17:04:49 His car was actually heavily optimized for speed
help 2023-05-25 17:05:07 I didn't even do any optimization on mine
help 2023-05-25 17:20:55 What do you mean?
help 2023-05-25 17:21:03 I have but not hover piston powered

What do you guys think?
creations-chat 2023-06-02 01:07:01 Because it's cool lol
creations-chat 2023-06-02 01:09:30 That's called a universal joint and it's job is to transfer rotational movement to the wheels
creations-chat 2023-06-02 01:13:48 Proof it can reach 330 studs per second
creations-chat 2023-06-02 01:18:03 I didn't even need to optimize it or make any fine adjustments to reach that speed. I just connected the boxer 8 to some wheels and that was the top speed. Also the engine was originally made for <@944981545834409984>
creations-chat 2023-06-02 01:43:56 Nice engine
creations-chat 2023-06-02 13:33:06 That will produce an unwanted downwards force. This is a better view of my engine which utilizes my scotch joke crankshaft design which eliminates rod angle. It also has a 7 block stroke and a plate-following design that is motor locked closer to the pistons half a block to produce more power.
creations-chat 2023-06-02 13:36:35 This engine also runs surprisingly fast considering the unusually long 7 block stroke. I have yet to actually calculated the RPM but my guess is somewhere around 750
creations-chat 2023-06-02 16:57:24 Probably not - which engine of yours are talking about?
creations-chat 2023-06-02 17:35:40 I don't remember can you send me a pic? (sorry my grammar is horrible today)

Oh

Maybe we can compare them but I'm not sure. What is the stroke length on that?
creations-chat 2023-06-02 18:06:02 Hello
creations-chat 2023-06-02 18:49:59 How did you get it to show the equivalent value next to the amounts?
creations-chat 2023-06-02 18:52:32 Ah, thank you
creations-chat 2023-06-03 05:14:01 Thanks
creations-chat 2023-06-03 14:31:35 I tried making that type of crankshaft once
creations-chat 2023-06-03 14:37:49 Also here is a pretty compact constant velocity (CV) joint that has dimensions 4x4x6
creations-chat 2023-06-03 23:48:34 What lol
creations-chat 2023-06-03 23:52:24 Sure, my username is Noodlesnake_2008
creations-chat 2023-06-15 17:29:30 Where are the gears?

You can edit messages to talk if you want
creations-chat 2023-06-19 19:31:47 <@724649799537786943> Explain to me how that is an 8 speed please
creations-chat 2023-06-19 21:15:21 I doubt he knows the basic principles or function of an actual gearbox
creations-chat 2023-06-19 23:40:39 Even you know
creations-chat 2023-06-19 23:45:44 He was talking about the offset between pistons not the "gearbox"
creations-chat 2023-06-21 21:29:54 Because you managed to trick people into thinking you creating something cool and groundbreaking when all it is are a bunch of motor2's
creations-chat 2023-06-26 20:49:17 What do you guys think of my 6-speed+R fully automatic planetary gearbox? I'm planning on posting it in <#384025409945337856> along with a video soon
