creations-chat 2021-04-21 05:36:32 i would crash as it requires the wall to move back, the turret to move up in an elevator,  and get pushed into where the wall was. motorlocking the turret would cause a nightmare. (im gonna have 6 of these cannons)

help 2021-04-22 04:23:06 idea is that turret can "deploy"
help 2021-04-22 04:23:47 also when the turret is gone a wall will pop up from underneath
help 2021-04-22 04:24:12 and when i want to deploy i can just move the wall down, and push the turret back out

bug-reports 2021-04-23 00:23:19 My game occasionally freezes / crashes without me being able to move my mouse at all (i have to alt f4 to get out). This seems to happen when I explode in any way (rockets and tnt are all I've had it with so far) and it started to happen around a week ago. My pc is more than capable handling heavy lag so it isn't my pc (rtx 2060 with 9th gen i7 and 100mps internet). I have even crashed / froze from one, normal (not motorlocked or anything like that) rocket. The builds that it crash on are not prone to lag either so this is for sure a game issue. The error message either takes absolutely ages to come up or it never does. My game just stops. I'm an idiot and never took an f9 but I will if I remember and if it lets me (screen frozen).
help 2021-04-23 00:28:36 this has been happening over multiple days

help 2021-07-08 17:22:03 why do explosives set to explode on impact choose to wait a second before exploding causing them to do no damage because they bounce? is it lag and can i fix it?
help 2021-07-08 17:27:05 it semi works but what ends up happening is that the autocannon decides to nuke itself
help 2021-07-08 17:27:10 and i put ignore self on
help 2021-07-09 21:33:28 the explosive balls from my autocannon dont blow up exactly on impact
help 2021-07-09 21:34:32 is there anything i can do about it
help 2021-07-09 21:34:57 ive made the impact speed 5 (which also nukes itself half the time but thats another thing)

creations-chat 2021-07-12 01:39:14 ok now calm down lol
creations-chat 2021-07-13 16:15:34 Don‚Äôt copy. Experiment. Step 1: imagine your project. Step 2: build small sections of it one at a time. When you are building these parts, you can easily evaluate any design flaws. Step 3: once your project is together, ask for feedback and get bullied by everyone enough to fix all the issues they found. Step 4: make new build and repeat. | <@!837769118237065226> it‚Äôs so much more fun to do it that way than to copy some tutorial and learn nothing
creations-chat 2021-07-13 16:18:04 <@!837769118237065226> and if I can‚Äôt convince you to not use tutorials (you learn nothing from then and it‚Äôs so so so much less fun to use them) then for the love of god DO NOT CLAIM IT AS YOUR OWN
creations-chat 2021-07-13 16:22:36 ***tutorials for building METHODS are fine but direct copy tutorials are what are bad*** <@!837769118237065226>

creations-chat 2021-07-21 19:18:40 explosive ball cannon or explosive block cannon what is better? (ignoring build simplicity, assuming I can make a reliable high firerate explosive block cannon)
the-dump 2021-09-25 23:00:52 HESH shells have an advantage over regular kinetic energy rounds as their effectiveness does not decrease with distance. This shell works by creating a shockwave on detonation. Once this wave reaches a void, it reflects back. The point at which the waves cross causes tension feedback which rips apart the plate, carrying a scab with approximately half the kinetic energy forwards, scattering shrapnel around the interior of the target. Test firing of the L4 against a Conqueror and a Centurion proved how powerful the round was. In two shots, the 183 mm HESH shell blew the turret clean off the Centurion, and split the mantlet of the Conqueror in half. HESH could also serve as a dual-use round just as capable of engaging enemy armor as for use as a high-explosive round against buildings, enemy defensive positions, or soft-skinned targets.
