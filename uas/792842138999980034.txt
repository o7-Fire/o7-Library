creations-chat 2021-08-23 13:29:54 no idea how to use camera lock but thank you, i'll try to figure it out
bot-central 2021-08-23 13:30:42 !rank
creations-chat 2021-08-23 13:36:37 <@456226577798135808>  it's good but i don't think the slate material is a good idea for the pipes, as for the paint you should try to use less saturated colours.
40, 45, 50 or 50, 50, 50 for the wheels would be good
search up steampunk colour palletes online aswell
colour pallete ideas:
https://www.color-hex.com/color-palette/88040
https://www.color-hex.com/color-palette/52100
https://www.color-hex.com/color-palette/1865
i suggest trying to work with all of the shades of brown + a green/green-blue colour and a soft black which i gave you the rgb colours for above
creations-chat 2021-08-23 13:39:07 maybe you could also try to incorporate more motor lock into your build to add on detail
use online references of steampunk cars too for ideas
creations-chat 2021-08-23 13:54:56 <@!695983848575598664>  got another camera angle? like a side view of the turret
i think the smoke kind of ruins it for me, try to increase the transparency of it and make it a tad darker
paint job is decent
wouldn't use rockets for the barrel
creations-chat 2021-08-23 15:03:51 why do people spoiler pings
creations-chat 2021-08-23 15:08:02 to me it looks like a mig-31 and f-14. plane isn't that bad but <@!758330155562696764>  you should use half wedges for the front rather than full wedges, try making the nose smaller and it'll look fine

creations-chat 2021-10-10 14:27:07 <@!633253307993030676>  quite nice, but i wouldn't make the barrel so square, use things like sparklers + cylinders + signs around a block to add more shape to it

creations-chat 2021-10-11 15:03:58 armament is missing but im not sure how else you could make it stick out from other f-15's because it's still an f-15 so unless you retrofit it with vtol or make some other small change (wouldnt really do much anyway) then it's still gonna look like an f-15

creations-chat 2021-10-11 15:07:09 https://coolors.co/ good website to find palletes, just look for military ones, i think a desert one could work nicely since i think i saw an ac7 game screenshot of it with such camo

just go onto explore and search "military" or something

nice looking plane, front kind of looks like f-4
creations-chat 2021-10-11 16:49:19 doesnt need to be longer, needs to be at least 1 block tall, do you even know what an f-4 looks like
creations-chat 2021-10-11 17:06:36 i take it that you don't know what an f-4 looks like then
im talking about the GLASS being at least 1 block tall, not the whole plane itself
creations-chat 2021-10-11 17:09:52 i'm talking visually dumbass, the black part (the cockpit) barely looks like it sticks 0.5 out of the fuselage, im saying **MAKE THE COCKPIT LARGER, IT LOOKS NOTHING LIKE AN F-4 PHANTOM**

im not the only person who is trying to explain to you that the f-4 phantom doesn't have such a tiny canopy, small build or not
creations-chat 2021-10-11 17:12:38 your build literally does not look anything like that, as i said im not the only person who is trying to explain to you that the canopy is too small

are you blind? compare your build to any f-4 variant. i am aware that the f-4's canopy is smaller than most other fighter aircraft but what some people here have already said and what i am trying to explain to you in the simplest terms that i can is that your build's canopy is too small, what do you not understand?
creations-chat 2021-10-11 17:15:06 cockpit examples = examples of how f-4 cockpits look like = yours is too small

i don't care what you're making, most phantoms look like one of the things below, hence "examples"

creations-chat 2021-11-09 18:52:45 yeah, your plane is really good but you've photographed it from the worst angle, maybe show the front part of it and zoom in a bit more and post it?

creations-chat 2021-11-13 10:35:23 what is that
creations-chat 2021-11-13 10:39:57 what the fuck is it though
creations-chat 2021-11-16 22:11:55 shit
creations-chat 2021-11-19 17:40:21 could still fix the shape itself without motorlocking, reference off of real planes so you know how planes are supposed to look.
creations-chat 2021-11-19 17:43:29 that's where the s at the end of plane comes in, don't reference off of a single plane, look at a variety of designs, fictional and real, etc to give your plane a sense of realism while having unique aspect.
creations-chat 2021-11-19 17:46:06 enough variety so that it doesn't look like chunky raptor/su-30 <:FineTroll:626841259746656289>

<@!527127714004467723>  but why
creations-chat 2021-11-21 09:36:49 is it? i mean i did see a build with like 10 upvotes but like 50+ reactions in the upvote thing when you check who upvoted
creations-chat 2021-11-21 10:02:24 desaturate everything, colours far too bright and add more variation
creations-chat 2021-11-21 10:05:42 not more colour, just change all the colours as a whole into more desaturated ones for more realism and then add darker shades to add more depth
creations-chat 2021-11-23 07:38:20 shit build <:trollface:775024642104229898>

creations-chat 2021-12-03 07:28:33 looks decently good for a tutorial
creations-chat 2021-12-03 07:31:21 still kind of used a lot of parts from tutorial
creations-chat 2021-12-03 07:33:37 the front is exactly the same lol what

you:
> i did not copy any part of the tutorial
> i have my f-4 for 3 months before the tutorial came out

also you:
> front is exactly the same + other aspects just in a motor tower
creations-chat 2021-12-03 07:36:20 "i didnt copied anything" you literally proved to everyone in this channel by sending photos of your plane and front  of tutorial that you did copy it lol

you literally provided evidence against all the shit you're saying right now lol
creations-chat 2021-12-03 07:39:36 shame because you look like you know  how to play the game properly, you're better off trying to remake the front so that it's actually your own üëç
creations-chat 2021-12-03 07:43:19 look at the photo's he sent earlier of tutorial front vs his whole build in build mode, fronts exactly same

creations-chat 2021-12-21 22:00:39 i could give more feedback if more picture angles, colours could be improved a bit as the white on the su-33's camo isn't the same white as used on the nose cone thingy. you could add lines on the cockpit aswell which would look nice if you blacked out the cockpit
overall is hot üëç

scratch the more angles thing, i just had a look at it in <#384025409945337856> , looks good to me, i can't name any other flaws other than the colour issue and maybe cockpit
creations-chat 2021-12-21 22:04:46 yes the paint is good but the white in pictures looks too white, make more blue, also i reccomend using colour picker from image website so you can upload a picture and nab the colours directly

cockpit fine anyway

creations-chat 2022-01-05 01:00:49 gotta appreciate someone who actually adds the slants above track, maybe you could try spicing up the livery with a camo or something aswell

creations-chat 2022-02-28 22:03:39 more detail on larger wheels (maybe with text) and add more depth on the whole of it, extremely bland so far

yes a catwalk will look excellent and use actual references even if thhs is custom just to get an idea for adding details on it

<@!375281006091173890>  whats it meant to be
creations-chat 2022-02-28 22:08:13 some idea for detail

windows are ok but could do with things like windscreenw ipe at front maybe but i was thinking add detail around the windows like a frame or somethig i dont  know

creations-chat 2022-03-05 07:42:38 <@!499693926878281728>  very nice details, pulled off one of my personal favourite helicopters well but i think you need to  get better lighter and less saturated colours and when you take photos of your build turn up max graphics temporarily so it's easier to see and maybe take your screenshots a bit closer to the aircraft and not standing away from it, i feel like some of the screenshots should have been taken from inside of the cockpit, but either way good job üëç
creations-chat 2022-03-05 21:37:38 @blokko#7728  good build, i like the details but colours way too dark, use an image colour picker for them

creations-chat 2022-03-06 18:32:27 <@456226577798135808>  good camo but on the whole extremely plain, lacks a ton of detail, and i don't feel like using a disconnector on the turret is a good idea
creations-chat 2022-03-06 18:34:41 i said that the camo was good, but the build itself is extremely plain and it lacks detail, the colouring is fine
creations-chat 2022-03-06 18:40:31 i know its supposed to be an ifv but i said that it looks very plain, not that it doesnt look like an ifv or has a bad camo. add more depth and detail to it with signs or something

creations-chat 2022-04-19 20:35:32 better pic for you + blueprint that i used
creations-chat 2022-04-19 20:39:17 yeah but i think instead of measurements its much much better to just use blueprints/visual measurements, measuring by the eye is often a better approach to things like these and if you look at your build with the eye compared to an actual top down of a mirage 2000c you'll notice that the back is extremely short

the back of smoke pipe has skinny circle part that you can use for that
yes you should cause glass cylinder look a tiny bit shit imo

creations-chat 2022-04-21 20:34:12 can that even fit on a plane
creations-chat 2022-04-27 20:45:27 <@817843440191930430>  can i ask how you took screenshots that look like they have a higher fov? ive been trying to figure it out and i ccant find any shaders which do that
btw excellent job, i like the canopy, havent seen anyone use a cylinder canopy for a ww2 plane before but it works nicely
is it? never actually seen the he-219 but it looks very good so well done
creations-chat 2022-04-27 21:26:40 make the rotors tilt like normal helicopter
fix landing gears sticking out (motor)
if its supposed to be an apache i think the mark was missed heavily in terms of the overall shape
fix weird fade camo??
lacks a lot of detail, add decals with text and stuff

creations-chat 2022-04-28 17:28:52 looks decent but i dont think cockpit should be glass since interior white stuff looks kinda shit and you could get more detail in the cockpit if you made it black with normal material

btw the gun infront of it that isnt attatched looks really chunky so i probably wouldnt put that on or id find a way to make it smaller/more visually appealing while functional
creations-chat 2022-04-28 17:31:17 this is what i meant btw by "interior white stuff"

<@918581321004089364>  idk what you mean by the connected thing
also the guns could always be mounted on wing side thingies, theres also another more compact way to make that same gun with same amount of guns but less motor lock but youd have to check a yt video for it
creations-chat 2022-04-28 17:34:22 im sorry english is my second language but the gun doesnt look attatched to the build (the build itself looks very far away in comparison to the gun and the gun is very very low down)
creations-chat 2022-04-28 17:37:48 okay i have 0 fucking idea what im looking at, do you mind if i try to join you in a game so i can try give better feedback? 
if you let me know if you're in a vip that would be helpful if yes
creations-chat 2022-04-28 17:47:41 it looks better but why is it floating off of the helicopter? you should really move it backwards and higher
creations-chat 2022-04-28 17:49:47 sometimes you gotta decide whether its more ugly but better function or less ugly but slightly less function
creations-chat 2022-04-28 17:53:40 dont remember saying that ü§®

creations-chat 2022-04-28 18:08:59 i think hyperbot's time is coming
creations-chat 2022-04-28 18:14:48 2nd picture looks a lot better, first one looks bent but i think you should colour the motor tower at the back and try to cover it up a bit
creations-chat 2022-04-28 18:20:42 nono i mean the back by here
colours could use bit of work too i think
and maybe you could use something else to attatch ropes because instant thought is "did not hide motor lock" rather than "ah yes for the rope"
creations-chat 2022-04-29 21:55:52 colours awful (i think golden gste bridge meant to be red too) and needs a lot more detail + smoothening out
creations-chat 2022-05-05 15:32:11 <@673670368757678106>  the build looks very nice overall, it has a nice shape in my opinion and looks very much like a corsair but i really suggest doing some work on the colours, the blue seems way too bright / saturated and i think you should try taking colours directly from image (search image colour picker online) , maybe possibly smooth out the canopy somehow or add detail to it.
creations-chat 2022-05-05 15:35:04 i dont see how there's exposed lock anywhere, the only motors i see are for flaps and propellor + the wing folding lol
creations-chat 2022-05-11 20:18:32 <@845396941373833226>  is it a joke build
creations-chat 2022-06-03 20:58:55 <@612103018246176778>  why'd you just post the same images again  as the last time you posted it

creations-chat 2022-06-03 21:02:19 well it works now if you didnt notice, but either way really nice job on it, looks great, but it hink you should fill in the white bit in the image i attatched
very hot üò≥

creations-chat 2022-07-08 20:04:40 <@388730515823525889>  very very nice, but i think an interesting feature would be if you didnt do an exterior, you could have some kind of rotating thing on the outside of the build that could change the images that the submarine takes photos of like in the real game and make like pixelated photos or something that it cycles between
creations-chat 2022-07-08 20:17:42 do you know how a revolver's reload system works? you could build it like that on the side of the submarine, with four images that rotate with a motor but make sure that everything else around it is black to keep the immersion. also maybe try to add that note thaat was on the floor if you didnt e ither with a paper emoji or a sign. also maybe you could try and see if anyone uploaded sound effects on roblox like with the creaking of the submarine when the thing moves or camera sfx. i woudnt be able to point you to any though since i havent played iron lung for a while but it's nice to see someone appreciating such an interesting game
creations-chat 2022-07-08 20:36:08 im not sure if this diagram will help, but the grey box is approximately the submarine area, the red circle is a motor and then you can rotate the images along the motor like that to go infront of the submarine's camera thing
creations-chat 2022-07-08 20:53:37 hi
creations-chat 2022-07-09 16:34:58 i've watched this about 10 times because of how satisfying it looks, i know its the wrong size but you should really make a different build with that thing cause of how cool and smooth it is, how did you even make the moving part?
creations-chat 2022-07-09 16:44:18 holy shit, thanks man, i appreciate the thorough explanation üëç 
very heavy or not,  its still an awesome concept
creations-chat 2022-08-02 21:49:07 "lets get some downvotes"
> upset over 11 downvotes

<@456226577798135808>  you seem a bit upset + even though its hard to build on mobile people mainly judge on appearance and yo useemed to expect downvotes so idk why you're surprised
creations-chat 2022-08-02 21:51:49 ok but why complaining over 11 downvotes
what score did you expect <@456226577798135808>  cause you seemed to expect downvotes
creations-chat 2022-08-09 23:23:36 <@804692015887417375>  nice and clean, maybe  add trapdoors for details  on wings but it looks  pretty good otherwise

<@658318819248570381>  the engines look good for the size imo but could  bei mproved tbh
creations-chat 2022-08-09 23:36:00 captured it very well too, might be nice to see some other kinds of armaments but i dont know much about the j-8b at all
perhaps try putting disconnectors or details around the drop tanks

also like the guy said below maybe the engines could use work too but overall the plane looks good imo
creations-chat 2022-08-15 23:49:01 <@551806781609869313>  satisfying to see new vs old chinook in same angle, improvements look good well done üëç
 but the back rotor area (wouldnt know what to call it) could maybe use a bit of work. the sea chinook one is a bit less curved and there's a few more details i think you could put but overall great imo
also maybe change the colour of it to white/grey or something, i know few sea knights are olive but i personally think a grey would look better
creations-chat 2022-08-16 00:04:16 i only call it chinook because sea knight is part of the chinook family, sorry lol
the rotor housing (thanks for the correct term) could still use more detail but like i said looks good üëç
creations-chat 2022-08-16 00:08:34 looks roughly the same to some1 who doesnt know shit about helicopters ü§∑
creations-chat 2022-08-23 22:03:22 <@745004934222577684>  why the watermark lol

creations-chat 2022-09-09 05:41:00 <@750546758542688367>  nice truck but old colours looked 100x  better in my opinion, shade of blue on the frnt feels off and the black feels out of place
creations-chat 2022-09-09 06:18:14 yea but proportions on it are a nightmare
creations-chat 2022-09-09 14:18:01 looks 10x better good job
creations-chat 2022-09-09 15:10:38 looks very clean idk why the planet making guy calls it gay
creations-chat 2022-09-09 15:13:06 smooth it out by adding longer wedges at the edges on top and bottom and sides so it wont look like triangle
creations-chat 2022-09-09 15:38:55 proportions look just fine + its smooth
<@680542146054455325>  i think its meant to not be 1:1 scale lol

creations-chat 2023-05-26 06:20:00 <@862160384206962749>  its really clean but i think the image quality doesnt do it any justice, maximise your graphics and take far closer screenshots and maybe people will find it more visually appealing. either way nice colouring, its very cool
creations-chat 2023-05-26 15:22:18 well imo it looks clean, nice work
creations-chat 2023-05-27 07:53:54 assuming these are old vs new , old nose looks more like raptor, new one too sharp
nice job tho, looks a lot cleaner all round
