creations-chat 2022-11-20 00:48:59 I will kill your entire family for that beginner nose and cockpit
creations-chat 2022-11-20 00:53:12 ? I thought when you see someone have a build without atleast one motor lock (that isn't exposed) and have whatever other weird problems that this server dislikes for some reason, you have to trace their ips and murder their families, I thought that's the tradition here.
creations-chat 2022-11-20 01:03:41 No, the tradition here is to be as robotic as possible and have every building niche in your build, kind of just making the same build over and over that other people have built over and over in the past too, and if you break off that very specific robotic pattern you get sentenced to the shadow realm or something because this server is just george orwell's 1984 camoflauged, everywhere you look and go there will always be the giant red poster, with the plane crazy logo and the caption below it "SKILL ISSUE IS WATCHING", and the thought police, always reading your mind, guarding your thoughts, making sure you don't even think about breaking out of the dystopian, arid wasteland of these repetitive builds.
creations-chat 2022-11-20 01:06:58 why do one block wide builds get downvoted???? this is what I'm talking about, they break people up with this bull[REDACTED], removing all originality and style, I'm telling you this is just f***ing 1984
creations-chat 2022-11-20 01:09:05 what do you mean? btw <@939960830181642330> do those trails appear in game too or is it edited
creations-chat 2022-11-20 01:11:20 nice
creations-chat 2022-11-20 01:23:03 I wanna build a new plane but I want it to be 1 block but it's gonna get downvoted ðŸ˜­
I don't want to live in this fucking 1984 world ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­
creations-chat 2022-11-20 01:38:09 why
creations-chat 2022-11-20 12:43:29 wtf even is roscale? also I want to make 1 wide because the regular 2 wide yields the same shape over and over and it is so boring
the-dump 2022-11-20 12:44:24 
creations-chat 2022-11-20 13:36:03 ok? and why does that get upvoted?
creations-chat 2022-11-20 13:38:15 what the hell is J
creations-chat 2022-11-20 13:40:30 that is impossible because the people of this server are incredibly unpredictable and you can't tell what plane they'll like the looks of
creations-chat 2022-11-20 13:43:42 does mig 27 look good one wide
and bruh I put alot of details on my planes
