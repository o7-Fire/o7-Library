creations-chat 2020-05-20 11:50:06 Large Submarine meant to be used for monitoring the ocean
creations-chat 2020-06-23 14:19:23 199 parts. Only powered with a conveyor-drive
creations-chat 2020-06-23 14:20:01 <@!259742168661360641> Seems futuristic but boxy. Add in some wedges and it should look better.

creations-chat 2020-06-23 15:37:07 that is so creepy
creations-chat 2020-06-23 17:05:23 this is remodelled from a few hours ago.
creations-chat 2020-06-23 17:06:25 the way it moves is using conveyor drives which make this quiet and stealthy.
