bug-reports 2019-02-08 22:14:05 I only have 3 planes
bug-reports 2019-02-08 22:14:12 2 of them are insanely small with not much on them
bug-reports 2019-02-08 22:14:24 Actually I have 4
bug-reports 2019-02-08 22:14:56 Keybinds are just not working.
bug-reports 2019-02-08 22:15:15 I did
bug-reports 2019-02-08 22:15:16 twice
bug-reports 2019-02-08 22:15:19 No success.
bug-reports 2019-02-08 22:16:09 There's a few infinite yields, one of the client scripts is probably waiting on a resource that's failing to load.

bug-reports 2019-02-08 22:16:41 I don't think that's related, but I'm not a dev for the game so
bug-reports 2019-02-08 22:16:42 ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
bug-reports 2019-02-21 18:50:09 Missiles are broken rn, pressing F or whatever key is binded to firing the missiles does not work.
bug-reports 2019-04-01 00:10:46 Since about 30 minutes ago, none of my planes work properly, all of the keybinds are completely broken.
bug-reports 2019-04-01 00:11:00 I've rejoined multiple times to no avail.
bug-reports 2019-04-01 00:11:34 oh
bug-reports 2019-04-01 00:11:35 Ignore me
