plane-crazy 2020-07-24 09:01:46 Alright
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 09:01:26 Cancel is X right?
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 09:00:58 <@!370594904268734464> Seems to be glitched. The bot DMed me but has not presented a code, unless I'm supposed to use the one shown in the video?

plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:35:10 Off topic but when large object stores are added to the platform, we can most likely make much larger and complicated builds if rick implements them
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:27:22 I will.
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:27:10 > it gets forgetten
Unless it gets reported \:-)
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:25:41 Wanna bet?
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:24:58 Moot point because you were the ones breaking server rules 😎
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:24:53 @ the people who 'reported' me
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:24:45 Also
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:23:39 Yeah that's who you probably confused with me
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:22:27 > I am raging over this community tearing themselves apart
Doesn't take much for people here to attack other people.
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:21:56 Nope, not UD either
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:21:51 You must have me confused with someone else, there's another "Reshiram" there
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:21:39 <@!283153622496182274> Not a mod for them, no
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:21:09 I'm still here bud \:-)
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:20:12 Oh my god 😂
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:18:53 <@!707991071476547745> I dunno what you could have reported me for, I haven't cussed, directly attacked anyone, or spammed
As for you guys, I cannot say the same.
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:18:29 > what happened here
One guy points out a problem with pvp and everyone loses their minds
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:17:43 > if you dont like it
> leave it
My point is proven here
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:17:06 Every time I've come to this server it's been nothing but a toxic response
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:16:36 > reshi, please understand that the whole community is not gonna adjust to justa  one person thinking differently
Yes so that gives you all a valid excuse to attack people that think otherwise. Perfect logic, I love it
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:14:44 <@!434989303882579981> Scroll up lol. You'll see plenty of it.
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:14:30 I'm not raging over anything lol
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:13:59 Yes call the mods, so they can scroll up and see you:
- Cussing
- Consistently attacking me
- Spamming
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:13:24 <@!645128367611445248> Using motors to pivot 180 degrees within a .5 foot radius, with instant acceleration and deceleration
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:12:35 For one your level of toxicity doesn't help
Secondly I fail to see how I'm the problem when I actually build planes that *don't* attempt to abuse glitches
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:12:05 I am not lol
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:11:38 But see whatever you want
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:11:31 Not what I said
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:11:16 > Imagine crying over pvp
Bro I'm not even close to mad lol, I find this highly amusing
The fact that everyone here has to collectively bandwagon on the hate train the instant someone even says ***anything*** about the state of pvp
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:09:52 <@456226577798135808> Consistently spamming pictures of my damaged plane doesn't add anything other than proving my point
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:09:12 See you simply prove my point
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:08:58 I'm not 'bitching', I criticized pvp. And the moment someone even remotely criticizes any aspect of the game the quality of the server degrades into a pile of crud.
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:07:59 <@456226577798135808> Literally you and basically anyone else in this channel rn with a few exceptions:
"NO YOU CANT JUST CRITICIZE THE GAME! NOOOOO :(((("
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:06:29 > if you cant handle how pvp is then do piss off mate
Right here. This right here is my point
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:05:47 You guys are so *toxic*, holy hell
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:05:19 Oh my god 😂
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:05:13 LOL
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:05:05 I came in here and stated that running into players that abuse physics glitches in literally every pvp server is irritating
And everyone decided to have a seizure over it
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:04:42 Here's what happened
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:04:39 False
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:04:32 >Abusing glitches
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:04:11 All I've done is prove my point
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:04:07 How am I a hyppocrate lol
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:03:50 > so do please shut the fuck up
Why don't you not act like a biggot please
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:03:18 So don't I, but instead I have to deal with toxic community members whilst running into players that consistently abuse the literal hell out of physics bugs
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:02:34 > its a roblox game you cant complain about overpowered stuff
The platform the game takes place on is not even relevant here, lol
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:02:00 > this resh guy really thinks he's the victim
>Be me
>Points out consistent use of bugs in pvp servers
>Watch as the community enters a seizure over pointing it out
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:00:24 > dry comeback
It's not meant to be a comeback. It's a fact. You guys are sitting here glorifying the use of bugs whilst dunking on players that actually want an enjoyable pvp experience without having to deal with insanely unrealistic planes
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 07:59:20 Imagine being toxic \:-)
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 07:59:00 Imagine being this toxic
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 07:58:30 > you were using suicide missile
Because I was fighting planes abusing physics glitches to quite literally turn on the spot whilst instantly accelerating and decclerating
What did you expect me to do lmao
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 07:57:28 <@!439783199988514817> Imagine utilizing bugs to completely destroy pvp servers
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 07:57:13 > says the one with shredder bug
I don't even have a shredder bug \:-)
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 07:56:50 Because I have better things to do than waste my time in a server consisting of planes that quite literally should not even work
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 07:56:08 Every server I join just has insane planes that either:
- Turn 180 degrees on the spot at 14 knots
- Use cutter bug mechanics
- Speed up to mach 5 then instantly stop
- etc
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 07:55:10 I think I'm permanently done with pvp lol
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 06:00:09 Doesn't help that tnt hits barely register
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 05:57:30 This cutterbug goes mach speed and turns on a dime
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 05:56:52 has been for weeks
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 05:56:50 Pvp is unplayable rn
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 05:56:46 Is there any good way to counter cutter bugs?
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 05:54:23 mmm 3 cutterbugs in one server
plane-crazy 2020-07-15 23:31:17 they pivot on a dime
plane-crazy 2020-07-15 23:31:11 so if they hit you they can yeet your plane
plane-crazy 2020-07-15 23:31:06 and they have the cutting blocks all over them
plane-crazy 2020-07-15 23:30:55 at high speed
plane-crazy 2020-07-15 23:30:53 They use rope constraints and a bunch of control surfaces to rotate in any direction
plane-crazy 2020-07-15 23:30:41 Not sure, never watched the tutorial vids on them
plane-crazy 2020-07-15 23:30:27 or variants of them
plane-crazy 2020-07-15 23:30:25 It's a struggle getting a pvp server that isn't filled with cutterbugs
plane-crazy 2020-07-15 23:30:08 I guess I'm done with this game for a while
plane-crazy 2020-07-15 23:30:04 Welp
plane-crazy 2020-07-15 23:28:14 Like this has been a problem in the game for months
plane-crazy 2020-07-15 23:28:00 with barely any solid segments
plane-crazy 2020-07-15 23:27:52 "just blow them up lmao"
Really hard to do when they're spread across the size of a runway tethered with rope
plane-crazy 2020-07-15 23:27:21 The game is literally not fun because of this
plane-crazy 2020-07-15 23:27:11 I'm tired of joining pvp servers and seeing 2-3 of them in every. Single. Server.
plane-crazy 2020-07-15 23:27:00 Please patch the cutterbugs
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 06:55:03 I take it the exterior is razers?
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 06:54:58 LOL
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 06:51:57 Hello 👋
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 06:51:35 Every single server has cutterbug users
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 06:51:30 I think I'm done with this game for a bit
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 06:41:03 This is getting nuts lol
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 06:40:59 Ok im boutta keep hopping servers
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 06:35:07 It'd be like banning players from destiny for using the sword glitch to jump gaps - it just doesn't make sense
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 06:33:53 The best solution is to implement mechanics that punish the use of cutters and the likes
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 06:33:42 Permaban isn't the right option lol - they're simply using mechanics that exist in the game
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 06:30:27 Nah this cutterbug user is just spamming "Ez" in the chat lol
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 06:28:12 I'll have to try that, been doing it manually
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 06:27:29 I'd rather not have to use a kamikaz every time I join a pvp server lol
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 06:27:11 Yeah I have one, but they're too fast and the explosions are prone to latency issues (I hit them on my screen, but the server is a few milliseconds behind so they don't register)
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 06:26:37 Can't join any pvp servers without 2-4 of them
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 06:26:24 Are there any plans to implement game mechanics that will counter the cutter bugs?
The meta is getting out of hand...
plane-crazy 2019-10-14 20:28:41 cutter blocks yeet whatever they touch
plane-crazy 2019-10-14 20:28:28 If the servers aren't updating then there's a flaw in ur update logic lol
plane-crazy 2019-10-14 20:27:55 Half the servers I joined were new
plane-crazy 2019-10-14 20:25:27 Ok got a new server
plane-crazy 2019-10-14 20:22:18 nvm
plane-crazy 2019-10-14 20:22:18 I got kicked
plane-crazy 2019-10-14 20:22:16 agh
plane-crazy 2019-10-14 20:22:14 ;D
plane-crazy 2019-10-14 20:22:13 <@!217336009455566848> u can join my server
plane-crazy 2019-10-14 20:21:35 if you bought a PC and it died after a month, take it back to where u bought it, it's probably under manufacturer warranty
plane-crazy 2019-10-14 20:21:01 If my desktop dies I won't lose anything
plane-crazy 2019-10-14 20:20:51 Backups are a thing 👀
plane-crazy 2019-10-14 20:20:42 *backups*
plane-crazy 2019-10-14 20:20:24 time to make some kiddies rage in the pvp servers
plane-crazy 2019-10-14 20:20:11 Game shutdown in 0 seconds
plane-crazy 2019-10-14 20:20:01 rip
plane-crazy 2019-10-14 20:19:52 hahahahah
plane-crazy 2019-10-14 20:19:48 yeah lol
