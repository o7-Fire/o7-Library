bug-reports 2022-01-14 15:34:28 • This bug appears to be literally locking engines to make them unusable, I had this originally happen with wtaer propellers and now its happened to regular propellers,
• Due to the recent rule changes I cannot post a screenshot but the debug menu does read
`"Stack Begin
Script 'Players.1235735654377435677.PlayerGui.Settingsgui.LocalScript',   Line    384   -   function particle sevent
Stack End"`
whenever I try to power the motors
• I don't think others can recreate it as I would call it a "infection" because it seems to be slowly effecting all my engine propellers for myself
• , my username is
`1235735654377435677`
and my user ID is
`474605163`
My save slots now affected are all my boats, tanks, and planes
