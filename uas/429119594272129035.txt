plane-crazy 2020-07-27 08:31:52 and it makes your builds Authentic and Organic™️
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 08:31:41 i like the hint of challenge
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 08:31:35 but why
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 08:29:43 is it weird that i don't use inf fuel
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 06:46:23 i want to make a plane but i will have to sacrifice functionality for detail but i need it to work well so i will have to sacrifice detail but i want to make it look good but then it won't have functionality but then if i add functionality there won't be detail and if i add detail there won't be functionality and now i'm stuck in a paradox
plane-crazy 2020-07-16 05:50:08 have the bombs arm on key so that you don't detonate randomly in a fight
plane-crazy 2020-07-16 05:49:49 add explosive blocks to your plane that detonate at a certain velocity, like 60, so when you crash it's realistic
plane-crazy 2020-06-16 08:32:34 does altering the length/force of a piston in a conveyer drive do anything
plane-crazy 2020-06-16 08:29:46 how many conveyer drives should i put on my rocket, 1, 2, 3, or 10
plane-crazy 2020-06-14 07:40:49 actually nevermind i don't want to know
plane-crazy 2020-06-14 07:40:44 what the hell is going on here

plane-crazy 2020-06-14 06:08:10 do i see ***exurb1a content***
plane-crazy 2020-06-14 03:19:51 shit switch over to the dump
plane-crazy 2020-06-14 03:19:45 uhhh
plane-crazy 2020-06-14 03:19:41 i kinda don't wanna go into the hell that is general right now
plane-crazy 2020-06-14 03:19:10 dangerously high
plane-crazy 2020-06-14 03:19:04 75%
plane-crazy 2020-06-14 03:18:54 currently i'd rate the corruption level at:
plane-crazy 2020-06-14 03:18:37 yea it just corrupts the server even further
plane-crazy 2020-06-14 03:16:10 because i kinda see this server as fucked up
plane-crazy 2020-06-14 03:15:59 is the only reason i'm here
plane-crazy 2020-06-14 03:15:52 and that
plane-crazy 2020-06-14 03:15:48 but i have access to pub vip servers
plane-crazy 2020-06-14 03:15:41 i would really rather not be in this server
plane-crazy 2020-06-14 03:13:32 tbh i'm on the non anime pfp side
plane-crazy 2020-06-14 03:13:20 because there's a war between anime pfp's and non anime pfp's
plane-crazy 2020-06-14 03:13:09 and also general is on FIRE right now
plane-crazy 2020-06-14 03:13:02 ye
plane-crazy 2020-06-14 03:11:47 i hold w, the walking animation starts, have to wait a WHOLE SECOND to actually start moving
plane-crazy 2020-06-14 03:11:25 sometimes they get so bad i get input lag
plane-crazy 2020-06-14 03:11:17 yea
plane-crazy 2020-06-14 03:10:53 although it does add 2 more degrees of accuracy
plane-crazy 2020-06-14 03:10:43 so i don't need to use !fps
plane-crazy 2020-06-14 03:10:38 i have a built in fps counter
plane-crazy 2020-06-14 03:10:30 they were litterally screaming in chat
plane-crazy 2020-06-14 03:10:18 my pc can handle that still in the high 50's
plane-crazy 2020-06-14 03:10:05 but it was only like 1k moving objects
plane-crazy 2020-06-14 03:09:56 because they lagged to HELL when i nuked
plane-crazy 2020-06-14 03:09:49 but they had a shit pc
plane-crazy 2020-06-14 03:09:44 can't remember their name
plane-crazy 2020-06-14 03:09:41 there was this one person in vip server 1
plane-crazy 2020-06-14 03:08:43 yea it's kinda small
plane-crazy 2020-06-14 03:08:23 and don't get me started on 0 grav
plane-crazy 2020-06-14 03:08:12 it can send you 5k studs a sec with 180 grav
plane-crazy 2020-06-14 03:08:00 the nuclear power plant explosion is so fucking intense
plane-crazy 2020-06-14 03:07:38 i made a nuclear power plant
plane-crazy 2020-06-14 03:06:37 also why is everybody always in wind tunnel and not hangar/jet stream
plane-crazy 2020-06-14 03:06:17 does it wack up save files?
plane-crazy 2020-06-14 03:05:46 it is really op
