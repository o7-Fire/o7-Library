creations-chat 2022-04-12 15:27:53 <@491342931911901225> 
let me give you an explanation abt y its not too good that some people fucking lack to be able to do in this server


the cockpit is not the best, its slightly a bit more back, and the intakes are a bit too large. 
the tail wings aren't accurate that much and there is motorlock exposure on the wings.
the wings also begin a bit behind where you placed them on your F35, and your fuselage is a bit short (in height).
its an OK attempt, i guess i can see some effort.
oh and the paintjob needs improvement

creations-chat 2022-04-15 16:45:31 <@712307160230396004> 

Your F15 is actually pretty nice.

but it can improve
there is quite some exposed motorlock, and the area in front of the engines arent fully flat.
The intakes are only meant to be going downwards in one certain angle, but youve used two types of wedges.

other than that, its a pretty nice jet

creations-chat 2022-04-17 16:13:06 <@793087413526200381> 

OK so you understand how motor locking works but your designing of aircraft is not the best

I know its a custom MiG-15 based aircraft but it does not look good and there is exposed motor locks,
maybe you can improve on the shape of the plane too, and the wings are detached from the actual body of the plane. The cockpit can improve, and the horizontal stabilizers at the back can improve a lot.
Also nobody in the community likes custom planes im sorry lol, it looks slightly like a Mig 19 though without the 2 engines

P.S: the wings are long as fuck

help 2022-04-18 16:48:58 the colour is terrible
help 2022-04-18 16:49:02 you can barely see the stuff
help 2022-04-18 16:49:05 change the colour around a bit
help 2022-04-18 16:49:15 or do a different camera angle
help 2022-04-18 19:37:54 alright, so
help 2022-04-18 19:38:55 make sure that the motors circled in blue are not touching the parts in which you want to move.
help 2022-04-18 19:39:18 basically, it looks like the base of the motors (the parts on the end which dont move) are connected to both leg joints.
help 2022-04-18 19:39:42 you have to make sure that the base is only connected to one leg joint, which is the one you want to keep still.
help 2022-04-18 19:40:31 If that does not work, then its probably because both motors have the same keybinds.
help 2022-04-18 19:40:58 Make sure that the forward keybind of one motor is the backwards keybind of the other, because if not, then one motor is trying to move in an opposite direction of the other motor, locking them in position.
help 2022-04-18 19:41:20 If none of the above work then the rotatable part is probably colliding with something
