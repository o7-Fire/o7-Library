creations-chat 2022-05-09 16:36:18 bruh dumb roscaler moment, if you were a good builder you'd know by 2 blocks its -half block - block - half block-
creations-chat 2022-05-09 17:56:18 ü§£ü§£
creations-chat 2022-05-09 17:59:04 even though u said its meant to be 1 block wide then you try to take the piss out of the 2 block wide but ok
creations-chat 2022-05-09 18:10:53 thats quite hypocritic after me reading yours and receiving brain cancer, taking the piss means making fun of something, and you were making fun of two block wide by placing just two blocks together when its half block - block - half block , but its hard to change the minds of people who believe roscale = 1 block
creations-chat 2022-05-09 18:12:47 ik it was a joke and i dont care that it was, what im trying to say that he is wrong about believing roscale = 1 block wide, but alas, you as another "roscale =1 block" believer cant understand that
creations-chat 2022-05-09 18:14:30 wdym, you cant just say that as its impossible to determine, there are things called scaling and there are different scales
creations-chat 2022-05-09 18:16:20 https://tenor.com/view/thanos-compelling-didnt-ask-dont-gif-24737803 also, just checked and doesnt seem like ur arms stick out of the plane like 4dr said

creations-chat 2022-05-09 18:30:50 tf??? you still are saying that a jet is basically the same width as a human body, saying that the plane would be basically a couple inches wide
creations-chat 2022-05-09 18:32:42 that doesnt work when a roblox avatar can be bigger or smaller than a human, there are many ways to change an avatar ingame, <@704516387170812025> stfu not even talking to you, irrelevant
creations-chat 2022-05-09 18:34:32 well then if so then it would be close to being the same size, as a block is the width of an avatar, and 2 blocks for an avatars height, <@704516387170812025> you're the one talking to me either way because i can talk and you dont need to, so shut the fuck up
creations-chat 2022-05-09 18:38:11 yeah so u wouldnt be able to make a cockpit 1 block wide, <@704516387170812025> YO BRO CHJIL BRO ITS A GAME BRUH BRO BRO YE BRO says you after you failing on trying to make me stop talking to someone else

creations-chat 2023-02-12 16:23:11 <@883063424614006878> its not, people like you usually build migs with short and stubby noses, also mig 29 is really big only just a bit smaller than Flankers
creations-chat 2023-02-12 16:25:46 yeah i know thats what i literally asked for tips in the first place to tell me what should i do with it <@883063424614006878> that canopy is no where good
creations-chat 2023-02-12 16:28:57 you probably are after not reading that i said migs are still smaller than flankers <@758679633955782666> <@883063424614006878> i dont care if you think that is better than mine i never asked if you like mine, go up and see what i said, the only thing i asked for is tips on the small part of the canopy
creations-chat 2023-02-12 16:32:07 you're right but i did mean to say that its not that small, <@883063424614006878> didnt ask for feedback, stop trying <:clueless:942802644043464734>
creations-chat 2023-02-12 16:35:15 <@758679633955782666> i wanted feedback on the small part of the canopy not your feedback on a just-started fucking build, and i dont need help
creations-chat 2023-02-12 16:38:30 <@758679633955782666> i just said i wanted feedback on a small part, i never said i wanted actual feedback because its obviously unfinished and just started, if i had a genuine problem that i don't understand how to fix, then i would go to <#478584971670454284>
creations-chat 2023-02-12 17:03:20 no <@883063424614006878> because you seem to have a mental disability and dont understand how to read what i asked for, stop repeating the same thing while unable to read what i said through your tearing eyes
creations-chat 2023-02-12 17:08:52 i recommend going to <#478584971670454284> and ask for tips how to use neurons within a fucking brain to read when someone says: ''any tips regarding this part or should i leave it'' and leaves a nice image with a nice big-ass arrow directly pointing to what im asking for
creations-chat 2023-02-12 17:16:45 nope pretty sure thats <#384025409945337856> yeah you should read the second bit of the description
creations-chat 2023-02-12 17:19:33 being a typical larp telling anyone who posts unfinished builds to shut up and keep saying that they are terrible
creations-chat 2023-02-12 17:23:15 so you are ignorant and toxic because you seem to automatically get an opinion that a build is trash just because its unfinished and therefore you say anything you can to make the other person stop talking or agree with you, just so you can cope with it
creations-chat 2023-02-12 17:26:59 its not my problem or fault that anyone else can post their own builds asking things or posting unfinished builds <@883063424614006878> about the 4th time you went back to being butthurt about an unfinished build and you just made yourself look like an idiot saying you arent being toxic when you have to talk shit about someone just to make yourself feel better
creations-chat 2023-02-12 17:32:06 never did i say you arent allowed to im fine with you giving feedback but dont expect me to listen or respond to you unless you answer the question what im actually looking for
