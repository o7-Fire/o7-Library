bug-reports 2020-09-02 23:15:30 upon spawning aircraft pitch axis becomes inverted. Happens after save or loading into game
bug-reports 2020-09-03 00:28:43 FEMBOY FLMAKER LOL GG nice name
bug-reports 2020-09-03 21:19:44 i am SO SICK of this happening. INVERTED PITCH. Essentially I CANT CONTROL MY JET because the MAIN WINGS keep inverting their purpose / control surfaces MAKING THEM act them same way as the tail wings.  As you can see in the video, as I move my mouse THE CONTROL SURFACES do NOT respond as they should. This issue has happened to SEVERAL of my aircraft and now it has happened to my BELOVED mig-29 Fulcrum " Sprocket ". This needs to stop happening. It makes the game a whole lot riskier
bug-reports 2020-09-03 21:21:20 Bruh
bug-reports 2020-09-03 21:21:27 it never happened like that before
bug-reports 2020-09-03 21:21:32 Still
bug-reports 2020-09-03 21:21:36 THIS IS A SERIOUS issue
bug-reports 2020-09-03 22:52:06 That was uncalled for and rude, <@!417397161198878731>
the-dump 2020-09-05 04:01:03 Ok that lepoard comming out of the water with Sabaton was epic
bug-reports 2020-09-10 00:11:24 You know, i'm getting pretty sick of encounting this bug where it inverts my pitch control. This is about the fourth time i have reported this issue but not the fourth time i have encountered it. Infact, IT IS FAR BEYOND the first time that i have encountered it. People have tried to tell me to do so and so or do this or that to fix it but it just doesn't cut it ! PLEASE FIX THIS ISSUE with the control pannels. P.S. I am tired of people trying to tell me what to do with it that aren't game devs or staff for THIS GAME. Please DO NOT respond to this if you are NOT staff involved
bug-reports 2020-09-10 00:15:57 Thats cool and all but no???
bug-reports 2020-09-10 00:16:31 I was always told, If you are going to do something, DO IT RIGHT OR DON'T DO IT AT ALL. It's starting to make a lot of sense to me
