creations-chat 2021-11-29 04:25:25 hehehe
creations-chat 2021-12-01 05:41:12 guys, where do i report
creations-chat 2021-12-02 04:35:00 how the hell do i do that
creations-chat 2021-12-02 04:38:00 easy for you to say, theres no way i can add SPECIFICALLY 5 cylinders behind the propeller, theres no way
creations-chat 2021-12-02 04:40:18 theres literally no space, i tried to make this as life sized/ small as i could, i cant add anything else without making it a lump of exposed motors, like i know theres already some exposed motor lock but thats just gonna be too much
creations-chat 2021-12-02 04:45:09 how about instead of being toxic maybe give advice, and if you cant figure out the problem of someone's build dont insult and criticize them for it
creations-chat 2021-12-02 04:47:29 bruh its annoying when people say dumb shit like "SkILL iSsuE LoL" maybe give some advice
creations-chat 2021-12-02 04:52:02 i dont care if it got downvoted, at least give some advice on how to improve it instead of saying "skill issue!!!" and moving on without elaborating or explaining
creations-chat 2021-12-02 04:54:04 im talking about you, not him, im glad hes at least trying to help, i dont see how the motor thing could make it better
creations-chat 2021-12-02 05:05:03 Oh nah I‚Äôm fine, I‚Äôm not gonna go all depressed because some fat, dorito covered, lifeless redditor criticized my build in a lego game and refused to explain any way of fixing it, ima go to sleep tho, gn, to the toxic 50% of people in this community I hope your pillow is warm on both sides tonight.
creations-chat 2021-12-02 05:08:35 Nice lol, literally every toxic person of this server, a fat greasy chicken

Edit: I am now aware that those are turkeys
creations-chat 2021-12-02 05:11:17 Yes cuz ‚ÄúSKILL ISSUE OMG OMG SKILL ISSUE‚Äù is real feedback
creations-chat 2021-12-02 05:22:40 u literally didnt, you didnt say anything but "sparklers and skill" and then sent the "Skill issue" gif, i understand its advice but just try to be a little less annoying with the stupid skill issue shit and maybe actually explain how i can use sparklers in the build and how i can implement them in the build, if you cant its fine just dont be toxic and annoying about it, please bro have some decency, whatever im getting tired, goodnight
creations-chat 2021-12-02 05:27:14 you didnt explain how to actually add those tho, you pointed out the problems and thats it, i'd be fine with that since its actually some helpful feedback, instead of doing that in the first place you decide to send a skill issue meme.
creations-chat 2021-12-02 05:34:19 ill actually try to remove that motor some day, i've had that thing for months anyway i havent modified it, ill see what i can do and ill repost it, anyway gn fr this time, thnx for the less toxic response
creations-chat 2021-12-02 05:37:33 nah i gotta completely remove that motor, the cylinders are further towards the nose
creations-chat 2021-12-03 00:37:57 
creations-chat 2021-12-05 20:00:10 guys hows this stuka so far, theres some parts i need to fix and i gotta paint on some more insignia but how is it so far, what can i add or remove?
creations-chat 2021-12-05 20:31:51 POV: One of your bombs got stuck inside your TU-2 and you crashed

creations-chat 2021-12-07 22:24:45 ik weird paint, just tell me good or nah, how is it so far
creations-chat 2021-12-07 22:28:58 ik ik, i didnt really know what to put, hey but i used a color picker like i was advised this time, so good white and grey colors, anything about the actual build? is it good or bad?
creations-chat 2021-12-07 23:02:07 O H     N O
creations-chat 2021-12-09 02:45:16 how get rnak
creations-chat 2021-12-09 02:49:27 it has a couple, uhh, rough edges, try changing the paint up a bit, also remove that random grey thing on the wheel, it looks really out of place IMO
creations-chat 2021-12-09 02:55:00 here comes oogway critisism, what is it? "SkILL iSsuE!?!1!1111!"?
creations-chat 2021-12-09 02:57:02 THANK YOU, EXACTLY THE PROBLEM, especially with the wing folds
creations-chat 2021-12-09 03:17:27 Yes ik it‚Äôs not a 1 to 1 scale exact replica but I tried my best, maybe the model I used was inaccurate or something, if you mean the camo then just to let you know, the Japanese have f-4s too, like I said it‚Äôs still a WIP so not too much going for the paint, just simple white plane with red dots, I was too lazy to actually make it a camo
creations-chat 2021-12-09 03:20:45 Ik I addressed all of that, I‚Äôll be fixing that in the near future, idk how I‚Äôll do a lot of the decals and what not but I‚Äôll deal with that tomorrow, or maybe Friday idk, anyway ima go to bed people, gn
the-dump 2021-12-15 14:08:19 The
creations-chat 2022-02-10 22:48:14 How submarine so far, will probably get rid of white line
creations-chat 2022-02-10 22:56:26 wow i didnt get cussed out within the first couple seconds of posting build progress
creations-chat 2022-02-10 23:06:21 what is it?
creations-chat 2022-02-10 23:08:38 looks cool
creations-chat 2022-02-10 23:12:29 i tried not to make it too dark, i used a color picker, apparently that's what the actual colors were, soviets used weird color palettes
creations-chat 2022-02-10 23:16:45 Oh no... i forgot i made this thing a while ago, lord forgive me for what i have made, ill probably remake it tho, if im not too lazy
creations-chat 2022-02-10 23:35:51 its a little over detailed, too much going on
creations-chat 2022-02-10 23:38:00 most of the parts here, like the things on the dark grey spots on the wings, the trails and stuff, maybe the exhausts or vents or whatever on the top, the snow blasters look cool tho, just make it a little smoother
creations-chat 2022-02-15 00:38:13 
creations-chat 2022-02-15 00:40:28 good luck
creations-chat 2022-02-15 00:45:31 bruh, why not
creations-chat 2022-02-15 00:53:35 üëçüèª
creations-chat 2022-02-15 01:36:12 whats wrong with this thing that only allows it to deserve 1 upvote, is it that terrible? i went for more of a size accurate approach so its not the most detailed
creations-chat 2022-02-15 01:40:24 but canopy angles are ugly and plus with a compact jet like that its annoying to put any angle locking on there
creations-chat 2022-02-16 13:19:04 
creations-chat 2022-02-27 23:34:16 Guys hows this zero so far, ill send the image im using in a sec, also ignore the couple unpainted parts
creations-chat 2022-02-27 23:42:43 rocket spam is rocket spam, realism dont matter g
creations-chat 2022-02-27 23:45:16 ur legit ignoring my statement that it doesnt matter
creations-chat 2022-02-28 04:37:33 guys i need help, how do i remove the base of sparklers
creations-chat 2022-02-28 04:49:09 Guys i improved the zero, how is it?
creations-chat 2022-02-28 05:05:54 How funny kamikazi fighter plane
creations-chat 2022-02-28 05:08:17 maybe... i feel like both are iconic but yeah i might switch it, OR just keep two saves of the different colors
creations-chat 2022-02-28 05:11:03 im not an anime fan but those are pretty nice and simple but ill probably just have two saves for em, perhaps one for K A M I K A Z E, also expect a Collab with a certain TBD... :)
creations-chat 2022-02-28 05:42:52 thnx üëçüèª
creations-chat 2022-03-01 05:01:58 Im afraid to post this but here, hows the wing on my zero
creations-chat 2022-03-01 05:04:35 u mean the back of the wing or the whole plane, cuz if u mean the fuselage thats my bad, it didnt angle down that much but it can go lower
creations-chat 2022-03-01 05:09:04 eh, i tried but i cant really do that since theres barely any room and im too small brain to know how to do that, ill probably add the angles later on, i think for now its good tho, i usually modify the shit out of my builds after like a week of having them lol
creations-chat 2022-03-01 05:11:19 also i fixed that piece of exposed motor lock on the back and improved the rudder
creations-chat 2022-03-01 22:53:23 wEEEE

creations-chat 2022-05-21 19:30:30 
creations-chat 2022-05-21 19:32:32 yeah ik, i kinda lost ideas for the back, also, yeah it is a modernized draken, click the thing i responded to in my post <@938196250791141386>
creations-chat 2022-05-21 19:35:40 to me not really, i wouldnt rotate that bit, the top of the nose is more steeper than that
creations-chat 2022-05-21 19:37:48 kinda fixed it i think, hows this
creations-chat 2022-05-21 19:41:51 thats very un-draken like, also the draken has one engine
creations-chat 2022-05-21 19:45:41 making a draken like plane with draken like features however not an exact replica yes
creations-chat 2022-05-21 19:55:34 I liek single engin tho, single engine good, hows the rest of the plane tho
creations-chat 2022-05-22 21:41:40 What‚Äôs the purpose tho üóø
