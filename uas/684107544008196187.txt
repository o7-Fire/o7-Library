creations-chat 2020-09-20 16:52:54 .....what is going on
creations-chat 2020-09-20 16:53:16 its just 2 almost identical ships stuck
creations-chat 2020-09-20 22:41:42 people who use all weapons: im a moron
people who use all weapons motorlocked for focus fire: im a freaking moron!
creations-chat 2020-09-20 23:59:31 imagine that thing being real, just the size of the building is enough to say that it's bad
even tho the fuel would be too much
creations-chat 2020-09-21 00:00:46 that would probably fit at plane crazy, but a real life model would need the entire america oil production just to power an trip
creations-chat 2020-09-21 00:01:20 nuclear waste is bad
creations-chat 2020-09-21 00:01:46 also did you guys know that railguns is real? eletric ships would be good with such guns
creations-chat 2020-09-21 00:02:17 damn...
creations-chat 2020-09-21 00:02:45 also, for the "big enough battery", maybe solar panels would be good
creations-chat 2020-09-21 00:03:03 during the daytime, its the firing time
creations-chat 2020-09-21 00:03:14 during the nighttime, relocating
creations-chat 2020-09-21 00:03:59 it does exist eletric ships, but they are destroyer sized

creations-chat 2020-09-21 00:06:17 irl, they say that railguns may be used for protect earth
creations-chat 2020-09-21 00:07:00 rn, they are just an project in the table, its an good gun for mortar-usage

creations-chat 2020-09-21 00:15:15 no im talking about an real "helicopter" called rotodyne, i just found about it in my recomendeds
creations-chat 2020-09-21 00:16:56 the problem about that inovating creation was bc "it was too loud", also it was going be amazing for saving ppl, 'cause its faster than a helicopter, and can lift up and down like an helicopter
