bot-central 2023-06-02 07:37:43 im so close but yet so far, in the end it doesnt even matter
creations-chat 2023-06-02 08:19:17 look ok, i dont know how to make it smaller
creations-chat 2023-06-02 08:22:58 how do you make the cockpit smaller without comprimising on looks and functionality, my plane is a WIP, so no intakes yet
creations-chat 2023-06-02 08:25:31 yeah, that is true, it does look skinny, this is what the plane is supposed to look like, a very big cockpit, yes, i will make the intakes an actual part of the plane.
creations-chat 2023-06-02 08:28:12 this is a google image but its about there(the wings fold in and the tails fold down)
creations-chat 2023-06-02 08:30:25 it has those in the picture i sent above, but its 2d so you cant see the angle also i will prob angle lock the intakes ðŸ’€
angle locks make everything look better
creations-chat 2023-06-02 08:35:19 that is true, cam lock does look better
but you see, i still need to figure out how to camlock
help 2023-06-02 09:00:19 motors 2 wobble is just caused by wings being on a motor2 or an excessive force being exerted on it, or too much motors connected
