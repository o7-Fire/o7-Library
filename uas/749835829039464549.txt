bot-central 2021-02-07 17:31:47 why
creations-chat 2021-02-07 17:48:30 This is the only way I can show my gimbal bc I can't post it in <#384025409945337856> so... https://youtu.be/iVcfdQYOM_A
creations-chat 2021-02-07 18:16:26 what's your feedback on this
https://youtu.be/iVcfdQYOM_A
too bad I can't get inventor rank from this
the first ever 3 axis gimbal
creations-chat 2021-02-07 18:23:30 ikr
creations-chat 2021-02-07 18:25:33 it's a gimbal
creations-chat 2021-02-07 18:27:53 the point in the gimbal is to keep the cam upright and make it more cinematic
creations-chat 2021-02-07 18:30:16 not rlly I can make it fully locked but I didn't want to
I would just need to add weights to the gyros
creations-chat 2021-02-07 18:32:30 it's not zoomed in i'm just looking through the camera(edit your post to respond^^)

I don't want ppl to copy me
creations-chat 2021-02-07 18:38:58 it's not easily copied <@!718006867808485447> yes there is better camera drones BUT THEY'RE NOT DRONES

they're quads
quadcopters
yes
bc the ping will disappear after you've already seen it
creations-chat 2021-02-07 18:43:27 Also I built my quad in like 2 mins (not including the gimbal which is the first ever working 3 axis gimbal)
all the ones i've seen were 2 axis or 1 axis gimbals
no it's not
hold on i'll post a real vid of it
creations-chat 2021-02-07 18:46:06 ok

creations-chat 2021-04-27 15:31:17 It's just one of those things that you need to practice to learn.

Also, your first 3-7 motor lock builds are more than likely going to be far from perfect so lower your expectations for your first couple motor locked builds so you don't lose interest and/or determination.

creations-chat 2021-11-12 01:10:15 number 1 was a joke and 2 in short is how is it less disrespectful to not make it at all

I probably am autistic tbh and I will stop once someone answers my question without making remarks about how shitty my build was etc
creations-chat 2021-11-12 01:12:55 I legit just want to know the answer i'm   done   arguing

I didn't want upvotes I could care less

My question isn't answered
creations-chat 2021-11-12 01:15:24 it wasn't just a tomb it was a tomb honoring fallen soldiers and in fairness it was a shitty build so I don't really blame them for being so enraged

Like a flanker? <@!735539533625557012>
creations-chat 2021-12-21 02:46:18 <@509857272651055126> disregard this message
creations-chat 2022-02-13 22:37:46 <@!760595454105878529> I downvoted https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/384025409945337856/942284879482195998 because it looks like discord light theme xD
creations-chat 2022-02-13 22:40:35 I was being serious, the jet is just super bright and it just looks plain.

Also my dad left 8 years ago
creations-chat 2022-02-13 22:43:49 wtf did you ping yourself

<@!771407578285867108> I didn't even say anything bad xd

<@!760595454105878529> HOLD UP this shit didn't start until you made a remark and just acted poorly about a joke I made comparing your jet which is pure white to discord light theme
creations-chat 2022-02-13 22:54:20 🤣

ayo he actually left
creations-chat 2022-02-13 22:59:54 bro whatever if you actually took the time to look at what was said you would realize he's just overreacting

bot-central 2022-05-19 00:06:12 oh bruh
creations-chat 2022-08-25 01:54:41 <@1001400227154116698> Ok so suggestions...(i'm just going to make this a list)
1. the protruding disconnectors at the sides of the back of the cockpit look weird...
2. the wings are too large
3. the back wings are the wrong shape
4. you should put the super rockets directly next to eachother using motor lock
5. spread out the missiles and have them follow the wing angle instead of a straight line

Hope this helps!
creations-chat 2022-08-25 02:00:22 yes, dump robot

yeah the tip doesn't look right
