help 2021-03-29 12:49:08 Don‚Äôt turn the toggle feature on
help 2021-03-29 12:49:44 So basically the idea is that you have to hold down a key that activates the propeller while also making the wings fold
help 2021-03-29 12:49:50 It might be a hassle

creations-chat 2021-07-24 17:42:59 I don‚Äôt think you can go too far with ‚Äúability‚Äù when it comes to planes. All there is to it is movement. If you want to make it more detailed I submit that making the scale of the whole build just a bit larger, would help.
creations-chat 2021-07-24 17:46:10 And that‚Äôs it lol. It‚Äôs not like the design or shape of the plane matters much when it comes to those things in plane crazy.
creations-chat 2021-07-24 17:49:15 Yeah I guess so. Though if you‚Äôre making a plane soley for perfomance then I suggest you should actually show how it performs, since according to you it looks ugly, so if all you‚Äôre gonna do is show a picture of the build then people are going to rate it on looks, not ability.

creations-chat 2021-08-08 16:57:14 yeah
creations-chat 2021-08-16 11:46:30 it looks cool, but some angles are really off. Fix the horizontal stabilizers, engines are too big, and it's really plain. I suggest you use different shades of the same gray and mix it around, to add some detail to it. Also I think the fuselage is a little wide, move the wings back in by a block.
creations-chat 2021-08-16 11:49:51 yeah. It's a way to freely angle blocks to your liking. It's a way of life at this point <:FineTroll:626841259746656289>

creations-chat 2021-08-17 10:38:32 Yeah but i noticed that a bunch of other people used that star in their builds as well along with some other details (like the f-18 in hof) I want to know where to get those to use them for my planes

creations-chat 2021-08-27 06:54:57 <@456226577798135808> The colors are so jumbled up and messy and are not compatible at all. There aren't any details and the whole texture of the mech is just so rough.
creations-chat 2021-08-27 06:58:41 if you want the colors to be messy then you should actually think what parts of the build are going to be what specific color. Take a picasso painting for example, the colors are plenty but they actually sort of work. The artist thought well of what colors should be used and where they should be applied.
creations-chat 2021-08-27 07:03:10 Yeah, this is basically what his build looked like. The idea and shape of the mech was okay, it's just the paint scheme that sort of ruined it.
creations-chat 2021-08-27 07:06:14 default color pallet
creations-chat 2021-08-28 12:14:18 w h a t.
creations-chat 2021-08-28 12:16:20 Cockpit is too short, and that flat surface on the nose looks odd.
creations-chat 2021-08-28 12:18:56 Also the shape of the plane should be way more curvy overall. And by the way just please change the paint now.
creations-chat 2021-08-29 04:02:13 laughing my actual fucking ass off
creations-chat 2021-08-29 04:06:05 @marcbakker your plane isn't the best, but you've significantly improved. I remember your old su 33, and comparing that to your new build over here, you're getting better.

creations-chat 2021-12-13 08:27:31 precisely, it would just be stupidly ineffective. You would have to be building with an extremely cooperative teammate. Trolls can just place random blocks that ruin your build or even worse, deleting your build entirely

it's clearly 100% an f-1 car

it's an a-10 warthog (scientifically accurate)

why wouldn't they
like where am I gonna put the pepsi wtf
creations-chat 2021-12-23 04:24:19 Over-detailing still looks good if you make each detail coordinate with each other
doublewide's tank is an example
