creations-chat 2020-06-11 07:43:50 Battleship Main Turret for my WIP Battleship Parts: 419 
Just a turret for my WIP Battleship, i wanted people to see it.
creations-chat 2020-06-11 09:34:18 Do you guys think that the turret is too small for its size?
creations-chat 2020-06-11 09:35:26 Heres a closer look...
creations-chat 2020-06-11 09:52:54 Ill make it 2 blocks wider
creations-chat 2020-06-11 09:53:08 I still have 1 block on each side available
creations-chat 2020-06-11 09:57:59 My ship will have 4 of those turrets
creations-chat 2020-06-11 09:58:05 Each having 400+ blocks
creations-chat 2020-06-11 10:21:11 I used alot of beams
creations-chat 2020-06-11 10:21:30 Its mostly the wedges
creations-chat 2020-06-11 10:23:41 Do you think i should switch to 2x2 cyclinder or maybe even 3x3?
creations-chat 2020-06-11 10:42:39 Building an upside down turret aint easy
creations-chat 2020-06-11 10:42:55 This is a far jump from building the protoype
creations-chat 2020-06-11 10:50:45 I experienced that too
creations-chat 2020-06-11 10:50:55 I built half of my carrier upside down
creations-chat 2020-06-11 10:51:07 Specially the interior
creations-chat 2020-06-11 10:59:56 Okay now, is it still small?

creations-chat 2020-06-11 13:44:15 No need to post that 3 times because its nothing special
creations-chat 2020-06-11 13:44:23 Alot of people probably have done it already
creations-chat 2020-06-12 02:59:40 Is this good?
creations-chat 2020-06-12 03:05:34 Would be nice if they add invisible motors
creations-chat 2020-06-12 03:06:01 That way i can remove that stupid little tower that is ruining the looks
creations-chat 2020-06-12 04:28:41 <@!459749464434016266> The power of wedges2 will help you fix your ship
creations-chat 2020-06-12 04:29:29 You wont be able to get alot of upvotes if you just place wedges and blocks everywhere
creations-chat 2020-06-12 04:29:55 You have to carefully build it ~~Like me spending half a day just to build one turret~~
creations-chat 2020-06-12 04:30:26 ~~And in the end i changed up my mind, and took another day to build a bigger turret~~
creations-chat 2020-06-12 06:12:52 chonk
creations-chat 2020-06-12 06:17:01 <@456226577798135808> Your battleship has no turrets
creations-chat 2020-06-12 06:17:23 Its more of a destroyer
bot-central 2020-06-12 09:57:55 !help
creations-chat 2020-06-13 02:26:37 <@!584019963556134913> I suggest making small carriers before making big ones
creations-chat 2020-06-13 02:26:50 Because it just looks like a weird floating box
creations-chat 2020-06-13 02:27:12 You gonna make smooth bows
creations-chat 2020-06-13 02:29:15 I actually could'nt recognize your build until i looked at the description
creations-chat 2020-06-13 05:28:14 It does make it cooler
creations-chat 2020-06-13 05:28:20 But ye, it doesnt need it
creations-chat 2020-06-13 05:28:56 Also is that a youtube tutorial
creations-chat 2020-06-13 05:31:17 I dont like youtube tutorial builds
creations-chat 2020-06-13 05:42:18 I like flexing with my carrier
creations-chat 2020-06-13 05:42:34 I am going to flex harder when my battleship is finished
creations-chat 2020-06-13 05:52:10 <@!516385356006817792> The problem is that you just copied the youtube tutorial
creations-chat 2020-06-13 05:52:26 Theres no point of showing off your creation if someone already build it
creations-chat 2020-06-13 05:52:30 Are you sure?
creations-chat 2020-06-13 05:52:40 It looks like its from the tutorial
creations-chat 2020-06-13 05:53:41 <@!409676438682206218> Its on youtube, i forgot which youtuber though
creations-chat 2020-06-13 05:55:52 Because i saw that exact jet in youtube
creations-chat 2020-06-13 05:56:24 It is
creations-chat 2020-06-13 05:56:28 Look harder
creations-chat 2020-06-13 05:56:52 I always see that tutorial jet in public servers
creations-chat 2020-06-13 05:58:56 How could we know if you didnt copy it?
creations-chat 2020-06-13 05:59:05 Its looks exactly the same
creations-chat 2020-06-13 06:02:13 Hmm the back looks different
creations-chat 2020-06-13 12:19:06 <@456226577798135808> I didnt like how you didnt use wedges2 in the b2 stealth bomber, but i will upvote because it looks awesome

creations-chat 2020-06-13 23:41:14 You're an expert at everything ~~Why arent you using wedges2~~
creations-chat 2020-06-13 23:48:47 <@456226577798135808> I have seen you post that like 4 times now
creations-chat 2020-06-13 23:48:49 Stopppp
creations-chat 2020-06-13 23:56:57 Ill rate it 1/10 because you posted it again and again
creations-chat 2020-06-15 13:50:05 Tbh the system should stay, so you can post pictures in this channel without it being posted in <#384025409945337856> .You can let people see your creation being constructed, you can post the picture where your build was based off, or you can show a picture what your build does...
creations-chat 2020-06-17 14:09:52 USS Montana vs Yamato, who do you think would win?
(For people who doesnt know Montana, its a US battleship that was planned to be the successor of Iowa, but the construction was cancelled.)

creations-chat 2020-06-28 08:52:57 I think good builds deserve more
creations-chat 2020-06-28 08:53:27 I also think that time is the only thing thats blocking good builds in reaching HoF or something else

creations-chat 2020-07-02 00:41:45 For me, the reason is that theres no wedges2
creations-chat 2020-07-02 00:43:05 Why not use traingle wedges2,3,4,etc.

creations-chat 2020-08-08 10:57:21 I really miss the outlines
creations-chat 2020-08-08 10:58:02 Removing the outlines made building large stuff 10000% harder
creations-chat 2020-08-08 10:58:54 Hmm thats a good suggestion
creations-chat 2020-08-08 10:59:02 Or a option to enable outlines in settings
creations-chat 2020-08-08 10:59:19 Or an option to enable outlines in settings...
