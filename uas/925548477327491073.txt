creations-chat 2023-01-07 23:21:41 yeah but those are a dated design and not really practical

creations-chat 2023-01-27 01:53:37 im not even rooting for us im not american so idc if they lost to nederlands
creations-chat 2023-01-27 02:13:14 maximum stealth achieved it doesnt even have an intake
creations-chat 2023-01-27 03:20:14 part of the fuselage its the gun bay
creations-chat 2023-01-27 03:29:04 there are a lot of jets with bottom mount guns  like the a10 and some migs also some british jets. F35B also has a gun pod on the bottom
creations-chat 2023-01-27 03:31:27 my plane is a multirole fighter so it works for ground attack and that what i mostly use it for anyway
creations-chat 2023-01-27 03:33:29 you just gave me an idea for the jets nickname
creations-chat 2023-01-27 03:36:08 nasa and the air force are focusing on developing flying wing fighter jets as part of the NGAD program because they provide more stealth which is what 100% of modern jet combat relies on, i dont see manueverability being prioritized in future generations
creations-chat 2023-01-27 03:38:44 this is what i took inspiration from, lacks a vertical stabilizer for stealth capability. this is what most modern jets are gonna look like anyway
creations-chat 2023-01-27 03:41:49 maneuverability is also not gonna be that important because of how unmanned flight is gonna be used in the future, moving around faster isnt that important because you can use a drone fighter to strike a target from 100km away without them picking you up on radar and even if you get into a dogfight there would be nothing to lose if the jet gets shot down apart from some money because its a drone and not a pilot
creations-chat 2023-01-27 03:44:56 unmanned flight will be much better than pilots bc you can repurpose the cockpit space and life support systems for other things like radar systems missile systems etc
creations-chat 2023-01-27 03:47:15 5th gen fighter jets have never been in a close range dogfight so the era of dogfights is over now its just like 12 br war thunder where you have jets sniping each other across the map with radar missiles
creations-chat 2023-01-27 03:49:54 unmanned flight will also be better because think about it maybe in the future we wouldnt even need a drone operator we can program AI to perform fire missions by themselves that shit would be so overpowered
creations-chat 2023-01-27 03:52:13 the technology already probably exists or is in testing but we will never know until its declassified 40 years later. Also most likely there will be failsafes to prevent hijacking of these ai systems]
creations-chat 2023-01-27 03:54:35 im thinking ai will be integrated into unmanned drones similar to JARVIS in iron mans suit which would make it impossible to go rogue
creations-chat 2023-01-27 03:57:02 and also these drones will likely be commanded by a pilot inside the drone hub jet which is what the US air force is trying to do
creations-chat 2023-01-27 03:59:03 lockheed martin should hire me for unmanned flight program director asap
creations-chat 2023-01-27 04:01:53 since unmanned planes dont have cockpits they can use all that space that wouldve been life support systems, screens, etc they can use that space for fuel capacity
creations-chat 2023-01-27 04:10:41 Surprised I‚Äôm the only person in the server that‚Äôs built a realistic 6th gen fighter they are so underrated
creations-chat 2023-01-27 04:19:36 Tbh I wanna work at Lockheed Martin or Northrop Grumman when I graduate college
creations-chat 2023-01-27 04:22:09 I wanna work at skunkworks inside LM they make so much cool prototypes
creations-chat 2023-01-27 04:26:21 You when 5th gen stealth plane better than 3.5th gen outdated fighter that every shithole country has for some reason
creations-chat 2023-01-27 04:28:57 The most underrated modern jet is the f35 or the eurofighter typhoon
creations-chat 2023-01-27 04:30:59 The euro fighters have crazy technology even for being 4th gen fighters they are constantly being given upgrades and new technology that can compete with the newest 5th gen fighters it‚Äôs crazy how people don‚Äôt realize how advanced they rlly are for their time
creations-chat 2023-01-27 04:33:09 My favorite plane of all time is the av8b/harrier it‚Äôs truly a work of art but it‚Äôs sad to see they are hated a lot for no reason
creations-chat 2023-01-27 04:35:10 What do you expect it was early vtol tech and most pilots didn‚Äôt know how to handle them that well
creations-chat 2023-01-27 04:37:19 The felon would probably equally compete with the eurofighter in terms of capability since they are both 4.5th gen and have some 5th gen features
creations-chat 2023-01-27 04:39:31 Another super underrated plane is the f18 growler which is kinda the American brother of the eurofighter
creations-chat 2023-01-27 04:42:30 I‚Äôve never been to an air show but I‚Äôve seen a MH60 blackhawk, f22, f16, and f18 fly in person
