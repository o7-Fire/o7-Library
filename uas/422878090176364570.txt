plane-crazy 2020-06-07 04:58:50 literally everybody does fortnite dances and is toxic in my school
plane-crazy 2020-06-07 04:57:58 fortnite is bad because it isn't community based like minecraft and terraria

plane-crazy 2020-04-16 23:02:43 
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 22:59:22 i just removed the back propeller, it looks worse. but the handling is by far better
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 22:58:56 
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 22:43:40 i think i might know the solution, but something would have to be as heavy as a rocket to stop it
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 22:43:19 the shaking occurs when the back propellers spins fast enough
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 22:43:03 anybody know how to stop violent shaking when you make a helicopter like this?
