creations-chat 2020-05-07 01:44:02 P-51? is it good?
bot-central 2020-09-27 16:12:13 -mapsuggest [Have Road Systems with tunnels and places for planes to do cool stunts like overpasses where u can fly thru or under overhanging things, Maybe small or large tunnels for cars , something like a Skate Park where u could use cars for stunts, a Better water way system so like rivers with bridges going over or maybe draw bridges for the rivers for boats and other things to go under, Racetracks, Drift places to just practice drifting around things(could be in Skatepark) maybe but it would be hard but like small race games where u need a limited am of blocks to join that race so like 1 rocket, 4 wheels, 100 blocks ect where friends can race and do cool vids, A large train track that goes around the map with turns, tunnels, bridges, ect. but best of all a way where u can choose your spawn so like 4 diffrent spawn plates in diffrents places so like in the dessert,snow, moutains, sea, ect but to just make the game more of a exploring game where certain vehcals or planes, ect can explore where things will have to be more creative to adapt to the diffrent places you can explore and go and build.]

creations-chat 2020-12-18 18:32:19 <@!442257205689843713> Dont make a frame like that it never looks very good and its just hard to make everything else, i suggest making the Propeller first and then adding the body. Also u suggest Motor lock (if u know how) but it helps alot to make compact helis and have good detail and angles.

creations-chat 2021-02-27 02:48:08 Ikr lol the middle is suck a thin part so yea when the color is all the same it shouldn’t stick out so much
creations-chat 2021-02-27 02:50:45 I was crap laptop in bed then and I didn’t feel like using screen shot so I pulled out the phone lmao. Better pic there
creations-chat 2021-02-27 02:52:46 I’m a slow builder cause the way I build I try to perfect every section piece by piece so I’ve prob spent 30 hours on it lmao so far not even done yet. Still got thrust vectoring and some how making a ball joint for the rocket to move
creations-chat 2021-02-27 02:56:25 Yea ik, but it’s a small part of the entire thing and I have no way to hide it :/ at least ik the final product will be accurate shape wise and look good besides all the exposed motor lock
