plane-crazy 2020-04-26 15:01:46 WAIT IT WORKS
WTF
plane-crazy 2020-04-26 15:00:49 ok
plane-crazy 2020-04-26 15:00:18 they were for sure controlled by motor 2
plane-crazy 2020-04-26 15:00:13 No, I looked at his wings
plane-crazy 2020-04-26 15:00:03 he said he had motor 2s and control surfaces.
plane-crazy 2020-04-26 14:59:38 barrel rolls and everything/
plane-crazy 2020-04-26 14:59:33 I guy showed me his plane that could turn like a keyboard controlled jet, but it was mouse controlled.
plane-crazy 2020-04-26 14:58:47 ^
plane-crazy 2020-04-26 14:58:43 wot
plane-crazy 2020-04-26 14:58:05 see, my problem is that I have a top turret on my plane that allows me to snipe targets with my mouse but its laggy. and if i remove it and use my plane to target instead, my aim sucks because Im bad at keyboard controls.
plane-crazy 2020-04-26 14:54:56 cuz currently my ADFX-01 is keyboard controlled
plane-crazy 2020-04-26 14:54:26 ok
plane-crazy 2020-04-26 14:53:39 :c I can't seem to get how to make my ADFX-01 mouse controlled with motor 2s and control surfaces. It keeps going haywire because the wings that use motor 2s are at the front
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 21:44:34 if only roblox had a better engine that allowed powerful pcs to harness their potential
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 17:42:00 something that breaks physics
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 16:26:41 I love joining PVP servers with unskilled ground warriors who instantly get obliterated by a kid with a plane that has a turret on top. It really says something about laziness.
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 17:07:30 General then?
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 17:01:21 Lol u watched that vid too?ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 17:00:11 He dont wanna fry anything lul
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 16:59:51 Go to the page where it says amd processor
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 16:58:25 <@456226577798135808> get the one with the rx 580 and the ryzen 5 3600
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 16:55:23 Oof
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 16:54:39 I built my friends pc
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 16:54:34 I could always help
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 16:54:03 Building a pc is literally like putting together a lego mindstorm set
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 16:53:42 Then i upgraded
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 16:53:37 I used to have a gtx 660
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 16:52:55 I already have a pc anyway. Rx 580 and Xeon E5-2630v2
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 16:52:16 400 fps in fortnite lel (competitive settings)
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 16:52:02 My friend built a pc with a ryzen 2700x and an rx 5700xt for 900 bucks
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 16:51:42 Lol
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 16:51:30 Fat dubs
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 16:46:46 The missile will one shot the plane
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 16:46:32 Even if the cheeser adds a super thruster,
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 16:44:26 Great for ground combat but it doesnt look all too well with aircraft, except helicopters
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 16:43:58 Adding a motor 2 to control rocket angles with your mouse lags any plane with 300+ parts
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 16:43:23 Continuing with the air-to-air missile suggestion
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 16:42:28 Looks like a lizard
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 16:42:03 Honestly this idea is better than having to manually aim at some kid with a small plane who has like 9 guns on the front
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 16:40:57 But the pro with a 300 part plane and keyboard controls will smother it anyway cuz even a single rocket can blow them apart
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 16:39:26 Encourages people to stop cheesing with tutorial planes decked with guns and rockets and start building things capable of flying at high speeds
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 16:38:28 Opinion: Dogfighting Rockets
- Lesser explosion radius than normal rockets
- Can only be used at speeds of 200 or greater
- Homing
- Only locks onto airborne targets
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 14:56:09 May you educate me on how that is...?
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 14:55:15 does anybody know how to control a motorized missile with their mouse?
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 01:12:45 faster than light speed. to be faster than light speed you must not exist as matter, but as LIGHT.
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 01:11:42 7k block server exterminator
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 01:11:20 The server crashed soon after.
