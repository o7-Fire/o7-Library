creations-chat 2023-07-06 16:43:37 im kinda testing the waters of angle locking, i need some tips
creations-chat 2023-07-06 16:45:43 thank you for providing me with a response, however, that is not what i was asking, if you'd like, you can try again with a more constructive response. i am looking for actual tips, not unreasonably vague, and useless information.
creations-chat 2023-07-06 16:47:51 i have a total of 9 days of playtime on the game, again, you seem to be failing the prompt of being "constructive" if you'd like, i can provide you with the definition of "mannerism" if you've ever heard of it, and maybe after that you can remove yourself from your little gaming nest, and actually provide a use to humanity, thank you.
creations-chat 2023-07-06 16:50:14 if the only thing you can use to defend yourself are nerd emojis, perhaps its best to find another hobby, you clearly cannot argue, nor can you defend yourself in any way. you seem quite feeble to me, if you aren't providing anything constructive, don't speak up. i am asking for simple help, but you think you're hilarious responding with non-helpful responses.
creations-chat 2023-07-06 16:52:48 so, since i'm new to the server, that means i dont have reason to speak? also, i do not believe i have anything wrong with me that would consider me disabled, unless you can provide me with personal details on myself that i dont know, then stop talking. and third, you seem to be going back to your original ways of saying "get good" instead of providing constructive criticism.
creations-chat 2023-07-06 16:55:11 i can guarantee that you have no clue who aristotle is, however, atleast you are piping into an arguement, and not being as weak and insignificant as our little pest trying to weakly defend himself against pure logistics.
creations-chat 2023-07-06 18:57:23 trying to make an aircraft, but its way too blocky, any way i could combat this? looking for actual help, do not respond if you arent going to say anything constructive, dm for screenshots
