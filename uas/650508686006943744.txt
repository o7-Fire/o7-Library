<@!489910972946055172> I would do this, but the wings are motor locked into the build itself.
help 2020-11-12 21:24:26 Yes, for my F-4.
help 2020-11-12 21:35:24 They are motor locked into the fuselage.
help 2020-11-12 21:36:07 One moment.
help 2020-11-12 21:40:44 <@!489910972946055172> The issue is that the camera locked blocks stay in the location that the camera was placed at, therefore, the part of the wing that should be tilted upward is floating beneath the build.
help 2020-11-12 21:51:25 <@!489910972946055172> Is this better?

help 2021-07-01 05:35:51 Please help, I'm trying to make a YA-9A and I'm stuck on the intakes. How do I make them round?
creations-chat 2021-07-03 23:40:30 Alright.
creations-chat 2021-07-03 23:43:02 What exactly should I add or remove to make it more detailed?
creations-chat 2021-07-03 23:46:44 The scale I made the tail at, it would be impossible to make it thicker, but I could maybe make the elevators thicker.
creations-chat 2021-07-05 04:09:15 Might you have even looked and compared the two builds?
creations-chat 2021-07-05 04:11:58 Just saying, you might want to do before making an assumption about build quality.
