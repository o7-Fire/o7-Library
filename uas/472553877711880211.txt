creations-chat 2021-06-15 14:22:01 I actually have lol, it vibrates, but not much idk what else i could do to amplify vibration

i do but they dont move around since theres no space
they just hit the inside and the torque they have causes it to shake a tiny bit
creations-chat 2021-06-15 14:24:48 that could work, is it just 2 servos facing eachother?

help 2021-08-25 22:13:21 yeah so i have angle lock here at the back, but the body is only 2 blocks wide technically so how could i do that
help 2021-08-25 22:15:25 also kinda motorlocked to hell and back rn

help 2021-08-25 22:23:16 like whats too flat tho
help 2021-08-25 23:29:23 youre rotating the axle and not the individual wheels you can turn better and have a bigger angle if you put the servos closer to the wheel
help 2021-08-25 23:29:43 make it stiffer
help 2021-08-25 23:30:42 you need to counter the weight of the wheel on the other side of the servo because motor 2s are weaker than a toothpick
help 2021-08-25 23:31:28 but i dont really think you should be having that problem anyway since youre only using like 2x2 wheels right
help 2021-08-25 23:31:48 what does

help 2021-09-06 18:47:29 Let me calculate rq
help 2021-09-06 18:48:13 Earlier i did a calculation where 952 sps = mach 1
help 2021-09-06 18:48:28 and mach 1 is equal to 667 knots
help 2021-09-06 18:48:38 so uhmm
help 2021-09-06 18:48:51 952 sps = 667 knots i forget how to do math for that
help 2021-09-06 18:49:08 Oh
help 2021-09-06 18:49:12 667/952
help 2021-09-06 18:49:17 which is 0.7
help 2021-09-06 18:49:25 so for 0.7 sps you get 1 knot i think
help 2021-09-06 18:49:35 or is it the other way around
help 2021-09-06 18:51:06 <@!791976765123592233> actually it was other way round
help 2021-09-06 18:51:11 1 sps = 0.7 knot
creations-chat 2021-09-07 10:06:37 <@702907851001167882> i talked about the scale and speed of sound in this game before, you can look up my messages in <#384021699466756107> containing mach

If you assume the height is 180cm then mach 1 is 952 sps and you can pretty much convert anything using that metric and blocks are 90 cm tall

I dont see whats necessarily wrong about it tho
i know it looks kinda noobish but I dont know what i could change to fix it

I would argue i used more effort than a 5 year old tho, theres an angle lock, plenty of repositioning to make the wings in the right spots, and no exposed motor lock

help 2022-02-19 21:10:04 i asked for help with the intake
help 2022-02-19 21:10:54 maybe because it isnt finished....?
help 2022-02-26 00:54:40 i think the issue is because the main rotor is not aligned properly with the center of mass of the heli so when you try to lift from the rotor it rotates the heli
help 2022-02-26 00:55:14 so try altering with ballasts
help 2022-02-26 00:56:04 if it tilts up when you lift then your center of mass needs to be more forward
help 2022-03-01 20:22:25 is there any yt guide for folding larger planes? im wondering how to make the folds for a really big plane

creations-chat 2022-03-07 19:51:32 im literally never posting in creations again its a waste of time

Message below you is what i mean

I literally got 80 upvotes off a small hexbug thing
creations-chat 2022-03-07 19:54:16 well how could i make it better
creations-chat 2022-03-07 19:56:21 this is the scale for reference (didnt bother to lock in the spars its annoying to do)

yeah i do agree about the thick grey part i just dont know what other blocks to use to make it still look like a ring

ik about the slanted wings

but i dont see whats wrong with the nose tho
creations-chat 2022-03-07 20:00:27 
creations-chat 2022-03-07 20:03:00 tf is that


no im not sure how to yet

it locks 2 wedges together into a full block at exactly 90 degrees (wing to fuselage)
creations-chat 2022-03-07 20:08:49 i know, what else to use tho
creations-chat 2022-03-07 20:12:05 yeah but i see it both ways as rip 225 and rip my hard work being crushed by the PCC senate

creations-chat 2022-03-07 20:19:53 You guys set really high standards for people who havent played the game half as long as you, thats why

high standards make people quit lol
creations-chat 2022-03-07 20:27:33 Well, if you think about it this way, *upvotes* increases a person's motivation to build more stuff, not downvotes, and while i appreciate all the feedback, i still feel like a lot a people simply dont have empathy for newer players and think we can just magically jump to the most hyper detailed builds - if you vote on a build not based on how you think you could do it but by how well the person did it for their perceived skill and also telling them how to improve it i think it would be a lot better


well not really what im saying but its just nice to work really hard on something and have it be justified by upvotes
i never said the sole reason to build was to post in creations, literally almost all my builds never go there
creations-chat 2022-03-07 20:30:54 bitches are for the down bad

no i meant as a mono engine this was my only plane comparable in size
there are 2 motors for each engine
it will create countertorque as a mono engine tho so youd have to deal with that but not too bad

creations-chat 2022-06-05 01:49:49 Bro your "up house" didnt just have 1 single exposed engine the entire thing sucked
You got the house layout completely wrong (no porch, weird tumor looking sections) looks like you used default colors (way too neon) and some of the colors were wrong anyway (the roof is not black) you could have hid all the mechanisms inside theres plenty of space

Bro youre the one who said "have you ever seen up" if youve seen up then you know the house looks nothing like that and its the wrong image but thats just a dumb lie

took quite awhile to design a prop that didnt rip itself apart
creations-chat 2022-11-04 21:33:30 If the prop spins too fast, the hover drives that power it break because of the centrifugal force
(the motor head flies off and then theres nothing to hover off of so the engine stops)

yeah i can control the pitch of the blades and have a throttle
creations-chat 2022-11-04 21:39:38 it also self rights so thats a bonus

nah if you set hover engines with drag it does it by itself nothing complicated

creations-chat 2022-11-11 14:31:49 quick sketch
Red is the motor (do you know how to set it up?)
Blue is motorlock tower
Also make sure there are springs so you can set the angle before locking
creations-chat 2022-11-14 22:27:28 put it in the water <:OmegaTroll:626841385118597152>
idk probably just the shape, also the exposed motors and cannons, I cant really tell from the image but it looks like the back is lacking details
creations-chat 2022-11-15 18:10:15 I concur
creations-chat 2022-11-19 02:29:52 thats pretty cool make the nose and sides  a little less rough
creations-chat 2022-11-20 01:08:48 where are the intakes to provide necessary oxygen to the engine for combustion?
creations-chat 2022-11-20 01:13:48 ah well besides that I think you could have added more detail to the back, the spine is also flat I think it would look nice as a gradual slope from the canopy to the back
perhaps angled rudders would look cool too
creations-chat 2022-11-20 16:59:57 <@719624954542293073> really good ship mustve taken months with all that custom angle lock
creations-chat 2022-11-20 17:08:45 
creations-chat 2022-11-20 17:10:48 Would work if your pilot doesnt mind being smashed in the head with motorlock and motors blocking right view
creations-chat 2022-11-20 17:14:09 it looks bad from that angle because it is bad

creations-chat 2022-11-23 00:06:00 it doesnt even have to be too much, i usually do only a range of like 10 on the RGB thing
try to imagine what spots would have water, friction or sunlight constantly on them, and shade them accordingly

no idea

Plane Crazy has died. Everyone secretly thought it would happen, but never like this. No players remain online. The only sign of life occuring when both SR_B3N6828 and themorfix45 join to compare the same 15 builds and techniques back and forth with each other. Occasionally a new player will join this once populated game, exploring the different mechanics and available blocks, wondering where it all went wrong. Rickje139 has not been seen or heard from since 2022, only sometimes updating his Discord status to "working hard on Plane Crazy update".  Who would've thought it would come to this. Everyone joked, sure, but it is all too real when it actually happens. Slowly and silently, Plane Crazy drifts to the backpages of Roblox. New generations of building games enjoy golden eras, completely oblivious to what once was.
