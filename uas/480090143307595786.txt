plane-crazy 2019-06-09 02:53:09 I don't play enough roblox to be involved w/ this community so I'd rather just get back to GETTING PAID WOOO
plane-crazy 2019-06-09 02:52:24 peace comrade ðŸ‘Œ
plane-crazy 2019-06-09 02:52:13 Whatever, back to not checking in on this server in about a month
plane-crazy 2019-06-09 02:51:28 It would to me, it's not like I'm active here
plane-crazy 2019-06-09 02:51:00 You know if you did, that would be the worst burn this server has ever seen
plane-crazy 2019-06-09 02:49:57 Would be nice if you send a DM his way to remind him to choose some creations
plane-crazy 2019-06-09 02:49:19 no
plane-crazy 2019-06-09 02:49:14 Clear it out when rickje gives me the creations :)'
plane-crazy 2019-06-09 02:49:01 That's a thumbnail yes
plane-crazy 2019-06-09 02:48:29 What icon
plane-crazy 2019-06-09 02:48:15 My laptop doesn't even want to fucking use my integrated graphics card lol
plane-crazy 2019-06-09 02:47:49 Integrated graphics is the shit man
plane-crazy 2019-06-09 02:47:07 Not that I played much anyway
plane-crazy 2019-06-09 02:47:01 Lol I can barely play plane crazy anymore because I get like 5-10 fps on low settings
plane-crazy 2019-06-09 02:45:59 And mind you I bought it back before when it became free
plane-crazy 2019-06-09 02:45:44 Yeah my laptop can't even run CSGO
plane-crazy 2019-06-09 02:45:33 Now that it actually has a graphics card and a 4-core CPU
plane-crazy 2019-06-09 02:45:16 It should be more than comfortable with rendering in 4k
plane-crazy 2019-06-09 02:45:02 Anyways I had my eyes on the Acer Nitro 5 17' GTX 1650ti for $829.99 at best buy
plane-crazy 2019-06-09 02:44:14 You can go shove a chromebook up you know where
plane-crazy 2019-06-09 02:43:52 That smiley face is a little rude so here's a genuine one :)'
plane-crazy 2019-06-09 02:43:25 I did my research, I'm not asking for your advice ðŸ˜ƒ
plane-crazy 2019-06-09 02:42:55 for a new laptop
plane-crazy 2019-06-09 02:42:51 I have a budget of 800 bucks
plane-crazy 2019-06-09 02:42:31 I'm poor
plane-crazy 2019-06-09 02:42:08 Yeah but in the event where my potato laptop can't handle rendering in 4k I just step back to 1080p
plane-crazy 2019-06-09 02:41:36 My thumbnails were in 4k starting from like 2 months ago.
plane-crazy 2019-06-09 02:40:49 <@!429665143677255681> With regards to your previous question about when the thumbnail is coming out, I can start working on it after the 15th because that's probably when I'll be finishing my current commission (which I'm actually being paid for unlike this gig), AND when rickje gives me the creations in studio.
