creations-chat 2022-08-25 03:30:43 It’s a little short, the angle is off and you made the canopy too large / long.
creations-chat 2022-08-25 03:34:09 It doesn’t really look like an f-4 at all.
creations-chat 2022-08-25 03:39:06 Try using a custom angle for the entire top part of the nose so it won’t look off
creations-chat 2022-08-25 03:41:30 No, I mean the top part of the nose ( the 1x2 down wedge on top and the half-block behind it) Turn it into an entire custom angle
creations-chat 2022-08-25 03:55:56 Now try fixing the canopy
creations-chat 2022-08-25 03:58:01 It’s a half-block too high, so try moving it down a half-block. Do that alongside the custom angle for the top part of the nose.

creations-chat 2022-09-20 21:28:03 I don't get why people do that when they can just simply piston lock copies of the wing over itself, it just makes no sense. One thing that doing that does is allowing for them to color the bottom of the wing, adding detail. <@448677698773057547> too bad, you'll have to cope with it.
