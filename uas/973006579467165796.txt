creations-chat 2022-06-05 16:20:56 it's a stereotype that people think white names are dumb asf cus they're new
creations-chat 2022-06-05 16:30:00 White and purple would be a better combo for color
creations-chat 2022-06-05 16:35:23 I like faded lines, like dark purple to light. Try that
Makes builds look VERY nice
creations-chat 2022-06-05 16:37:25 Maybe add some snow camo? Because why not. If it's mostly white it should have some form of camo for snow
Purple needs to be in selective spots, that's why it looks worse
creations-chat 2022-06-05 16:41:01 Mostly spots that have a clean line across the jet. It only looks good for some builds
help 2022-06-05 16:52:47 Quick question: new to motorlocks, if I motorlock something, and joints r attached, do i need to anchor it so it wont glitch tf out or
bot-central 2022-06-05 16:59:48 Shh, silence. It was never seen
creations-chat 2022-06-05 18:01:32 correct
help 2022-06-05 18:12:35 Literally my first motorlock build lol
help 2022-06-05 18:32:16 wHAT
creations-chat 2022-06-07 17:11:57 <@791950688016007168> Very nice 2014. Only issue is that your 2014's arms are tiny compared to the movie. Another thing, the snout is a bit too pointy, and there are some dorsals along his tail. Other than that, best 2014 ive seen
creations-chat 2022-06-07 22:35:42 EMBED FAIL
creations-chat 2022-06-07 23:34:48 ~~add more detail~~
creations-chat 2022-06-09 23:03:53 I do that but with mechs

help 2022-06-11 19:37:37 I need some help. Does anyone know a good mechanism to push an object forward, and then make it rotate in all directions? Like the Queen from Aliens, she is able to freely push her head out of her headcrest while being able to look in all directions

help 2022-10-15 02:23:13 also note unpowered regular motors also wobble
help 2022-11-11 21:16:06 is slate a good material if you were to have a giant mech that could fly
help 2022-11-11 21:20:52 then what would be a good scale material that is light
help 2022-11-11 21:20:54 kind of important
help 2022-11-11 21:24:20 looks kind of ehh
help 2022-11-11 21:25:35 i mean maybe i can make the underbelly plastic since it doesn't require much detail, but main scales slate and cobblestone

creations-chat 2022-11-13 02:04:17 it's literally a rite of passage here like i said; in order to not become a whitename, make sure the others know you're not cringe and post an actual good build
creations-chat 2022-11-13 02:06:46 post images not videos, and post during the day and not night
creations-chat 2022-11-13 02:10:52 im still baffled on how the FUCK it has upvotes

creations-chat 2022-11-13 02:13:07 what is plane crazy becoming the older it gets
creations-chat 2022-11-13 02:15:31 it used to be filled with good builds now it's terrible builds once people realize that upvotes are so easy to get
