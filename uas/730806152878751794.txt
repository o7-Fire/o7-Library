help 2022-05-18 13:00:25 My new inline 4 cylinder model engine. Still needs cams and valves but I need help on something else.

I need 2 main fixes. 
1. The timing belt keeps slipping. 
 2. The timing belt creates too much friction.
help 2022-05-18 13:01:51 Yes it did jam here for a sec

It was running a slighty higher speed than it could handle
help 2022-05-18 13:02:12 Strech as in give the tracks some elasticity?
help 2022-05-18 13:02:22 *stretch
help 2022-05-18 13:02:46 No jamming isnt an issue
help 2022-05-18 13:02:54 I need it to stop slipping
help 2022-05-18 13:03:15 It keeps slipping and i need it to be accurate for the valves to work properly
help 2022-05-18 13:03:23 Hmm yea ill try that
help 2022-05-18 13:03:31 Also any way to reduce friction?
help 2022-05-18 13:03:48 The engine rpm significantly drops with the belt
help 2022-05-18 13:04:13 Hmm with the blocks preventing slipping i wont need it to be fabric
help 2022-05-18 13:04:19 Thanks mate!
help 2022-05-19 08:16:13 Guys how do i make it so that when the bottom cog (powered by motor) rotates once, the top rotates perfectly in sync with it?

There should be very little to no slippage in the belt.
help 2022-05-19 08:23:41 tried it  but nope
help 2022-05-19 08:24:23 15 on bottom (max torque)
help 2022-05-19 08:24:32 top unpowered no torque
help 2022-05-19 08:26:04 did so
help 2022-05-19 08:26:10 still no avail
help 2022-05-19 08:26:21 i tried all the way at 1
help 2022-05-19 08:29:02 Thats what ive been trying but im not sure what to use

I tried trails

I tried motorlocked trails so that its shorter and interferes less and i tried half wedge
help 2022-05-19 08:29:15 Oh and wingpanels
help 2022-05-19 08:31:31 The reason i need it to be so perfect is that im building an engine model and need the crankshaft and camshaft to be in sync or the valves will smash into the piston
help 2022-05-19 08:31:53 Hmm i shall try them
help 2022-05-19 08:32:54 Ah i did try that

But the pistons create resistance and it goes faster when the two middle pistons are going down
help 2022-05-19 08:33:05 So again out of sync XD
help 2022-05-19 08:33:34 I even tried to use magnets to stick to the belt
help 2022-05-19 08:34:40 Im ready to have to build a completely new belt itself but i just want it to sync
help 2022-05-19 08:34:46 Hmm
help 2022-05-19 08:35:23 Like a sideward boxer engine u say??

Once i get the belt thing and all working, ill build a v8
help 2022-05-19 08:35:38 Boxers are just too imbalanced
help 2022-05-19 08:36:23 I use ice for the pistons but glass for the chamber
help 2022-05-19 08:36:33 uhhuuhh continue
help 2022-05-19 08:36:44 It is
help 2022-05-19 08:36:58 ohh like that
help 2022-05-19 08:37:50 Bruh
help 2022-05-19 08:38:06 Ill try that and return lol
help 2022-05-19 08:39:31 U mean like this rite?
help 2022-05-19 08:42:21 Ah that was the first one i tried
help 2022-05-19 08:42:27 Again too much slipping
help 2022-05-19 08:43:04 Did so
help 2022-05-19 08:43:12 Pistons, suspensions
help 2022-05-19 08:43:44 even using an anchored block once it was pushed down by pistons
help 2022-05-19 08:45:12 mhm
help 2022-05-19 08:45:22 to psh down?
help 2022-05-19 08:48:49 That i will have to for the valves
help 2022-05-19 08:49:01 This is just to check if the belt is good enough
help 2022-05-19 08:49:45 Hm so the suspension pushes up on the camshaft
help 2022-05-19 08:50:03 I shall try to use something like that
help 2022-05-19 08:50:15 Oh there is no glass at the top
help 2022-05-19 08:50:37 IT opens directly into the chamber
help 2022-05-19 08:50:44 And the pistons are ice
help 2022-05-19 08:50:59 mhm
help 2022-05-19 08:51:00 0.o
help 2022-05-19 08:51:02 okk

help 2022-05-19 08:55:56 No camshaft or whatever just crank, pistons
help 2022-05-19 08:57:46 I would have gone i6

i wanted to build like a 2JZ GTE but then lag

Like evne with 4 cyls its this bad
help 2022-05-19 08:58:29 Its pretty bad already
help 2022-05-19 08:58:38 Only when the engine is running it does this
