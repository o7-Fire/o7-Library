creations-chat 2022-08-25 05:19:30 listen bro, your a white name. Aka, your just new to the server. You would not understand. My point is, if there’s a bad build, I can downvote it. I can give advice. Would you rather, let them get more negative feedback around their bad build or give advice to help them? There is nothing wrong with downvoting.
creations-chat 2022-08-25 05:21:37 listen bruv if im seeing this in creations what am I going to do

creations-chat 2022-08-25 05:25:51 bro the whole point of downvoting is to say a build is bad, are you thick?

creations-chat 2022-09-24 02:05:07 ok any tips for side detail? I thought of rivits, but the trails would just lag the game and it would be way to hard. text wouldent work bc im using disconectors for outer shell. i COULD do trails if i took the effort.
creations-chat 2022-09-24 02:07:24 yea i agree, i may just add rivits with piston lock and trails, and just reanglelock all over again
creations-chat 2022-09-24 02:09:58 ty, ill start on the rivits rn
creations-chat 2022-09-24 02:13:59 <@472553877711880211> any advice?
creations-chat 2022-09-24 02:16:15 bro........
creations-chat 2022-09-24 02:18:23 "not so blocky ooooo" ITS PLANE CRAZY
creations-chat 2022-09-24 02:23:11 already doors for behind, and I’ll make the muzzles a darker colour. Thanks for the advice!
creations-chat 2022-11-14 21:19:02 Any advice? My sloop, "Merle"
creations-chat 2022-11-14 21:22:29 Ah! Thanks for the advice. The hull shape is a bit goofy id say, but for Bermuda sloops, (which i based it off of) have quite flat hulls, and they dont protrude much, like conventional tallships, such as brigs or frigates. I may also fix the colours. And tootip, the hull is tall because it is tall. Thats how sloops are made, They rest VERY low in the water.
creations-chat 2022-11-14 21:25:15 the white is the waterline.
creations-chat 2022-11-14 21:28:08 Sure, also <@937119057042358322>, Any advice?
creations-chat 2022-11-14 21:30:15 What colours do you recommend using? Any specific ones? I do agree, the colours do look quite bland.
creations-chat 2022-11-14 21:32:32 like the cannon wood colour?
creations-chat 2022-11-14 21:34:35 uh,.. why not just use hover engines? They arent even laggy and they are very reliable.
creations-chat 2022-11-14 21:38:40 hmm, good idea. I may do a similar colour, but have different colours around the sloop so it looks worn
creations-chat 2022-11-14 21:47:07 It’s a sloop, it’s ment to be tall. The Bermuda sloop is taller then this but this is what I got out of a quick search. The Bermuda sloop is also usally equipped with two gaff rigged sails.
creations-chat 2022-11-14 21:52:38 Usually. The one I’m building is.
creations-chat 2022-11-14 22:00:48 true
creations-chat 2022-11-14 22:03:03 I also fixed colour. any better <@402617794606399488> ?

creations-chat 2022-11-14 22:08:15 Good point, but what do you mean by “sit properly on the water”?
creations-chat 2022-11-14 22:10:46 <@472553877711880211> any advice?
creations-chat 2022-11-14 22:29:24 Exposed motors? Do you mean like, the netting and rigging? And I posted a photo of it in the water in creations  chat. But other then that, thanks for the advice.

creations-chat 2022-12-31 00:28:15 give some genuine advice please.
creations-chat 2022-12-31 00:30:36 <@334903399709671445> your real quiet now aren’t you.
creations-chat 2022-12-31 00:32:42 correction, you stopped listening after you got proven wrong*
creations-chat 2022-12-31 00:35:20 I replied to you like 3 times which counts as a ping and I pinged you as well? Also you changed your story. You said you were “ignoring me”.
creations-chat 2022-12-31 00:37:23 the dude who you said was using photoshop? You aren’t in hof either. So it doesn’t really make sense? Also if you “don’t care” why are you replying??
creations-chat 2022-12-31 00:39:27 lol <@334903399709671445> tried to spam L
creations-chat 2022-12-31 00:41:34 yeah your message got auto deleted for spam. I also said “Sr is one of the best” and he’s MUCH better then you, and also me. L
creations-chat 2022-12-31 00:43:45 1. You never called me bad, you have shit advice and your being a hypocrite.
2. Your avoiding what I say, trying to play it off as “I’m mad and butthurt”
3. You didn’t recommend, you never even showed methods and you expected me to fix all issues that are unfixable, and you wanted me to “remake the build”
creations-chat 2022-12-31 00:46:58 I never dmed anybody? You also say your “hella bored and it’s funny”. It’s funny that you keep replying and acting like a obese twitter user, trying to cancel everything in your way. Everyone here sees how much of a clown your being, I’d recommend stopping now

creations-chat 2022-12-31 00:51:43 I’m just really curious, why are you defending him? Have you read what he’s said? or are you just supporting the minority group. Please read up on the chat.
