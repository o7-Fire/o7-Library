creations-chat 2020-10-27 16:33:32 So I was scrolling on YouTube, and I saw this post of 2 jets that caught my interest, does anyone mind telling me what they are called? I kinda wanna build these
creations-chat 2020-10-27 16:34:42 That's the jaguar?
creations-chat 2020-11-04 13:06:50 Whoever made the su-33, good job
creations-chat 2020-11-04 13:08:22 How is locus a copy king?
creations-chat 2020-11-04 13:11:03 Okay, here's my thought on people who use tutorials, yes, they suck, but you can also learn from those tutorials to improve on your building skills, but if you only use tutorials, yeah you're not getting anywhere
creations-chat 2020-11-04 13:13:39 Ngl, when I first played plane crazy, I used tutorials, but now I build things on my own using those skills I learned. And crinje, i know, people who do that are willing to be bullied, laughed at and even called out for it so i suggest to not do that bc basically everyone here can easily recognize a tutorial build
creations-chat 2020-11-04 13:15:28 If you want to be part of the community, try to build on your own, even if it turns out to be garbage, you can still make it better
creations-chat 2020-11-04 13:18:08 Rey, that J-20 isnt that bad, but it still looks a little off, and it's not the color
creations-chat 2020-11-04 19:13:33 Does the the f-14 even have ailerons-
creations-chat 2020-11-04 19:15:15 Yes
