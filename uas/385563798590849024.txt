plane-crazy 2020-05-13 23:52:59 Finding out the speaker was really expensive...kinda made me upset
plane-crazy 2020-05-13 23:49:17 ?
plane-crazy 2020-05-13 23:48:18 And its kinda unfair for people who cant afford the speaker..but want to get it..
plane-crazy 2020-05-13 23:47:21 Why didnt they just not make it a game pass if he made a feature where you can just mute certain people with the speakers
plane-crazy 2020-05-13 23:46:03 Yeah...
plane-crazy 2020-05-13 23:45:38 The speaker should be cheaper...
plane-crazy 2020-05-13 23:44:28 It sucks you have to buy the speaker....if I had enough robux... I would've had the speaker and be able to host air shows...or like...something idk...
