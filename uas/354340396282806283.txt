bug-reports 2019-01-19 02:43:25 Im going to be honest that this is more of a messed up feature than a bug: Shortcut keys. GET RID or FIX them. Yes they can be useful but when typing in the chat any letter that has a shortcut opens that shotcut during chat. EX: My plane's disconnect button is G. I type "Good" and the plane disconnects bc it has G in the text. This and while typing in keybinds for items it opens that shortcut, so pressing 1 for the keybind opens the build menue too.
