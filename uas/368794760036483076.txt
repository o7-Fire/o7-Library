creations-chat 2020-12-21 22:29:40 <@!697600896615448578> what should I fix that u dislike?
creations-chat 2020-12-21 23:11:19 <@!697600896615448578> You mean to tell me that making the tank big is what was wrong? I dont think you know what a P-100 ratte is..
creations-chat 2020-12-21 23:22:56 <@!697600896615448578> Well frankly I don't give a shit considering you have no reasoning as to why.
creations-chat 2020-12-21 23:25:13 <@!697600896615448578> Its factory new, and I have added all the details
creations-chat 2020-12-21 23:27:14 <@!697600896615448578> I don't think its that u specifically dislike my build of it. I think u genuinely just dislike the tank in general.
creations-chat 2020-12-21 23:29:45 <@!572411935669354528> if u haven't realised it yet there are so many different blueprints. Showing one I did not replicate is not a accurate comparison.
creations-chat 2020-12-21 23:32:01 I like how you judge it by the picture he sent even thought I did not follow that blueprint. Even after I stated that it shows your ignorance.
creations-chat 2020-12-21 23:34:57 I requested feedback, He responded with ''its too big'' Not even knowing the existence of the tank nor its actual size. The fact that u are defending him when I ask for his critism is just miserable.
creations-chat 2020-12-21 23:37:15 @Septagin Considering you didn't read the conversation you may not know that I stated there are different blueprints therefore no exact blueprint is the ''accurate''
creations-chat 2020-12-21 23:40:00 I didnt bring up any blueprints to this conversation I used one I found on the internet. Im happy to share the blueprint. And I know you wont reply Septagin because its quite obvious im in the right here.
creations-chat 2020-12-21 23:44:19 Imagine warning someone for requesting feedback. ''instigating drama'' Ye right like telling people to behave wont instigate drama.  Tired of these mindless people. Im leaving this shit community even though I joined today. Might ddos the game bye.
