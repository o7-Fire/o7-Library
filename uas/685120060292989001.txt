the-dump 2021-10-12 02:32:25 <@456226577798135808> Zumwalt was a failure
the-dump 2021-10-12 02:32:31 Is this bad enough?
the-dump 2021-10-12 02:33:18 Itâ€™s true tho
the-dump 2021-10-12 02:33:40 Thatâ€™s why 2-3 out of the 32 were built
creations-chat 2021-10-12 02:36:59 I mean i did it with no motor lock
creations-chat 2021-10-12 02:39:31 And how exactly is one supposed to do that?
creations-chat 2021-10-12 02:41:42 I donâ€™t do motor lock
help 2021-10-12 18:12:06 Anyone can help me build this?
help 2021-10-12 19:11:47 Well I honest donâ€™t really care as long as it is a 2:1 scale and than it goes up, down right and left I am fine
help 2021-10-12 19:12:57 Also it is called a Mark 13 missile launcher it was the main weapons for the American Oliver Hazard Perry class Frigate that I am starting to build today
help 2021-10-12 19:13:26 I did all the rest of the weapons it just I am very struggling to make this one and I need help for it
help 2021-10-12 19:13:35 Angle locks?
help 2021-10-12 19:21:16 And if you cant do it I could always just not put it and add the 2004+ upgrade that removes that launcher and add ads a cannon there instead
help 2021-10-12 20:27:36 Nvm, I am abandoning the projet since I canâ€™t find all the dimensions of the boat
bug-reports 2021-10-13 01:04:23 Uh so I went in a pvp server and we were spawning here, we had no assigned plots and the menus were broken (couldnâ€™t open them)
bug-reports 2021-10-13 01:16:32 It was the hole server that was bugged
bug-reports 2021-10-13 01:17:50 I reseted it didnâ€™t do anything and I left the game and rejoined a pvp server, it put me in the same one and it was still broken
bug-reports 2021-10-13 01:18:11 Yeah maybe
bug-reports 2021-10-13 01:18:43 Oh
creations-chat 2021-10-13 02:01:11 Can anyone please give me feedback on my naval weaponry I made?
creations-chat 2021-10-13 02:03:29 Wdym, also why is there a 2 min cooldown here when <#384025409945337856> have a 10sec one
creations-chat 2021-10-13 02:06:53 Lol I havenâ€™t thought about that and since I have more likes than dislikes now I think I can say I am better with weapons than tracked vehicles. And I also understand that my torpedo launcher isnâ€™t that great
creations-chat 2021-10-13 02:10:49 Yeah I made it cuz I needed a 3 wide torpedo launcher for a ship that I was going to make but I decided today to nvm that ship (R.I.P), so itâ€™s basically make out of cylinders, half balls and snow blaster thingy for the tip
