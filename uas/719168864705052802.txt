help 2021-03-09 23:39:30 Exactly
creations-chat 2021-03-09 23:42:07 the intake is too wide, elevators are skinny, the tail is fat, weird vertical stabilizer shape, weird wing shape, default landing gear, weird rear landing gears placement  and tf is that paint
creations-chat 2021-03-09 23:51:01 The F16's intake is as wide as the fuselage, yours' wider, making it look weird
The elevators are way too small, 95% of jet fighters have triangular elevators 
The tail is too wide, its a jet fighter, not a cargo
Where's the engine??
Vertical stabilizers on jet fighters usually are triangular
Curved delta wings are __really__ rare, the 2 real planes having them are the Concorde and Vulcan, and i dont think any other have that kind of wing
Jet fighters have their rear landing gear close to the fuselage, not on the wings, the weight would bend the wings and damage/break them over time

I based mine off something, making a totally custom plane without knowing much about aviation will just end with a weird ass plane 
Thats why basing custom builds off something is a good way to make decent looking things

creations-chat 2021-04-05 19:07:41 Coaxial and tail rotor 🤮
bug-reports 2021-04-05 19:09:50 Center of Lift
creations-chat 2021-04-05 19:12:10 Yea but 3 rotors is fucking dumb:

For coaxial rotors: rotors counter each other's yaw equally since they spin at the same speed

For conventional rotors: the tail rotor is here to counter the main rotor's drag (creating yaw)

So
For your heli, the tail rotor is useless
creations-chat 2021-04-05 19:15:45 <@!707133341454958604> yes and no they're mainly here to counter the main rotor's drag, but by changing its speed it can modify the yaw

<@!701882026948821084> coaxial helicopters can also turn right and left without a tail rotor
creations-chat 2021-04-05 19:27:25 This is our coaxial helicopter, both rotor spin at the same speed, it flies still
creations-chat 2021-04-05 19:29:49 But if you increase the speed of 1 rotor, they wont counter each other's drag equally, making it yaw

the-dump 2021-04-16 22:44:11 guys don't listen to the user named "Da_hars" (also known as Hars#4780). He is a very dangerous person for a number of reasons, all of which I will inform you about. Reason number one is the best motivator to stay away, just to prepare you for how much of a monster he is. He is french. I am not responsible for any harm that information may have physically or mentally caused you. The second reason is directly tied to the first, and that is that he eats escargots. Escargots are snails that were cooked. Disgusting. The third and hopefully final reason is that he is the same person as the notorious "fartsniffer42". He has long denied this, however me and my team have evidence suggesting that he is in fact fartsniffer42, and is therefore a threat to anybody near him. Please stay clear of this "person", and please stay safe. If he comes near you, it is recommended to remind him of past french losses in order to make him angry and make him argue with you. Try to sneak away as he rants.

the-dump 2021-07-21 19:20:55 guys don't listen to the user named "Da_hars" (also known as Hars#4780). He is a very dangerous person for a number of reasons, all of which I will inform you about. Reason number one is the best motivator to stay away, just to prepare you for how much of a monster he is. He is french. I am not responsible for any harm that information may have physically or mentally caused you. The second reason is directly tied to the first, and that is that he eats escargots. Escargots are snails that were cooked. Disgusting. The third and hopefully final reason is that he is the same person as the notorious "fartsniffer42". He has long denied this, however me and my team have evidence suggesting that he is in fact fartsniffer42, and is therefore a threat to anybody near him. Please stay clear of this "person", and please stay safe. If he comes near you, it is recommended to remind him of past french losses in order to make him angry and make him argue with you. Try to sneak away as he rants.

the-dump 2021-07-22 08:41:15 guys don't listen to the user named "Da_hars" (also known as Hars#4780). He is a very dangerous person for a number of reasons, all of which I will inform you about. Reason number one is the best motivator to stay away, just to prepare you for how much of a monster he is. He is french. I am not responsible for any harm that information may have physically or mentally caused you. The second reason is directly tied to the first, and that is that he eats escargots. Escargots are snails that were cooked. Disgusting. The third and hopefully final reason is that he is the same person as the notorious "fartsniffer42". He has long denied this, however me and my team have evidence suggesting that he is in fact fartsniffer42, and is therefore a threat to anybody near him. Please stay clear of this "person", and please stay safe. If he comes near you, it is recommended to remind him of past french losses in order to make him angry and make him argue with you. Try to sneak away as he rants.

the-dump 2021-11-13 16:24:57 guys don't listen to the user named "Da_hars" (also known as Hars#4780). He is a very dangerous person for a number of reasons, all of which I will inform you about. Reason number one is the best motivator to stay away, just to prepare you for how much of a monster he is. He is french. I am not responsible for any harm that information may have physically or mentally caused you. The second reason is directly tied to the first, and that is that he eats escargots. Escargots are snails that were cooked. Disgusting. The third and hopefully final reason is that he is the same person as the notorious "fartsniffer42". He has long denied this, however me and my team have evidence suggesting that he is in fact fartsniffer42, and is therefore a threat to anybody near him. Please stay clear of this "person", and please stay safe. If he comes near you, it is recommended to remind him of past french losses in order to make him angry and make him argue with you. Try to sneak away as he rants.

the-dump 2021-12-05 19:41:57 guys don't listen to the user named ~~"Da_hars"~~ "Hars_Ramsay" (also known as Hars#4780). He is a very dangerous person for a number of reasons, all of which I will inform you about. Reason number one is the best motivator to stay away, just to prepare you for how much of a monster he is. He is french. I am not responsible for any harm that information may have physically or mentally caused you. The second reason is directly tied to the first, and that is that he eats escargots. Escargots are snails that were cooked. Disgusting. The third and hopefully final reason is that he is the same person as the notorious "fartsniffer42". He has long denied this, however me and my team have evidence suggesting that he is in fact fartsniffer42, and is therefore a threat to anybody near him. Please stay clear of this "person", and please stay safe. If he comes near you, it is recommended to remind him of past french losses in order to make him angry and make him argue with you. Try to sneak away as he rants.

creations-chat 2021-12-14 20:36:34 <@!702907851001167882> here's your unwanted feedback:
- shitty ass gears
- shitty low effort tail
- really bad cockpit (looks like an apache's, not sci-fi at all)
- fat guns
- ugly turrets
- missing rocket pod things
- weird wings
- car headlights <a:WhatIsGoingOn:610227973777522688> 
- shitty line texts
- not angled wings/tail
- garbage fans (too small to lift anything + they're filled)
- low effort secondary intakes
- bad paint
- missing a shit-ton of details
- ugly chin mounted turret
- missing outlets

conclusion: looks like if an apache and a sparrowhawk had a baby but it has down syndrome

creations-chat 2021-12-21 20:06:58 "But there is a hitch: While it is, relatively speaking, rather straightforward to split an atom to produce energy (which is what happens in fission), it is a “grand scientific challenge” to fuse two hydrogen nuclei together to create helium isotopes (as occurs in fusion). Our sun constantly does fusion reactions all the time, burning ordinary hydrogen at enormous densities and temperatures. But to replicate that process of fusion here on Earth—where we don’t have the intense pressure created by the gravity of the sun’s core—we would need a temperature of at least 100 million degrees Celsius, or about six times hotter than the sun. In experiments to date, the energy input required to produce the temperatures and pressures that enable significant fusion reactions in hydrogen isotopes has far exceeded the fusion energy generated."

so you're telling me, your thing with no doors and no protection walls goes up to 100M °C?

the-dump 2021-12-24 15:57:15 Hey guys, just wanted to wish you all happy holidays. Discord is filled with ready-made messages that you don't even read, you just copy and paste to every server, I don't like that, I like writing from my heart. Our friendship, from the deepest to virtual, is very important to me and couldn't ever be represented by a cookie-cutter message from anywhere. So, I'd like to thank you all, you're the best furry roleplaying server I've ever interacted with.

creations-chat 2022-04-03 19:19:04 i like the meme, but its just too high/round, unlike a real crab, and the claws should be more spread out

creations-chat 2022-04-03 19:45:12 the merus are too thin, too flat
the cephalotorax has edges on the ghost crab and is more squary from the front while yours is mostly a ball
the dactyls are too thick
the mouth could need more work, instead of just being two lines
exposed engines on the bottom
and im too ill to continue the list

creations-chat 2022-05-11 15:16:32 nor can you since you thought you needed to copy paste a message to "prove" me im doing something "bad" (which is quite stupid when you know half of the server shits on other people's builds)
creations-chat 2022-05-11 16:01:44 (and on my way to shit yourself)
creations-chat 2022-05-11 16:07:11 i may also allow myself to say that this thing looks really bad
creations-chat 2022-05-11 16:08:57 because more than 99% of the builds posted nowadays are down bad

creations-chat 2022-05-13 17:27:31 still funny how people irl are really open-minded about lgbtq, but the guys who spend 10 hours a day on discord just dont know anything about it so they consider it bad, while thinking they're "based", "cool" or whatever
creations-chat 2022-05-13 17:29:24 there is a way, but i cant explain it here without getting murdered by the mods
the way is just a little more complicated
creations-chat 2022-05-13 17:32:54 <@673249949344989203> LMFAO MAN YOU PLAYING ON A TYPEWRITER??
creations-chat 2022-05-13 17:42:40 not only countries have flags, groups of people also had flags, political parties, like the funny mustache guy's party, that south american clan, the families during middle ages and before, and lots more things
now some groups of people also have flags, not many things have changed, yet a lot of you guys hate them for being something they arent
creations-chat 2022-05-13 17:46:32 being gay is absolutely not new, it was already widespread during the antique rome, lots and __lots__ of men were gay, and it was normal
creations-chat 2022-05-13 17:56:13 the thing is, you guys always complain about the lgbtq people doing anything, like the gay pride, what should you do? not let them do it? then the country isnt a democracy anymore
i agree some of them may act stupid, but in the "straight side" there's also fucking assholes, and some usually use way more violence than us just to be seen as "cool" or "based" by their stupid ass friends
theres also people who voluntarily go to the gay pride to damage surrounding things, deteriorating the lgbtq's image, just like for the yellow jackets in france or any manifestation
creations-chat 2022-05-13 18:54:28 definitely
creations-chat 2022-05-13 18:56:14 nah im just cooler <:clueless:942802644043464734>

creations-chat 2022-05-24 19:42:21 nah, i just think that build looks bad
creations-chat 2022-05-24 19:46:45 true, true my friend
creations-chat 2022-05-24 19:58:05 the build itself doesnt make any sense either, where the fuck would you find a 15 meters thick rope, the crane at the back would collapse under its own weight and rip the barrel off on the way cuz its probably heavier, why the fuck is there a plow if the thing doesnt even seem to move, and why does it not have any on the sides, where does the dirt that gets stuck in the plow goes, and why put a plow when you can just put suspensions, why is 85% of the build weird structures around it, while the shwerer gustav was just one 2 rail wide block, where do you load the ammo from if the thing has walls all around it, why would you need ropes to hold the barrel if it already has supports, are the ropes for holding the barrel, or the rope structure??
creations-chat 2022-05-24 20:00:52 fiction doesnt mean you can do whatever you want and its fine either, theres a minimum of logic needed
creations-chat 2022-05-24 20:21:17 imagine upvoting a build just cuz its big
creations-chat 2022-05-25 12:55:34 same for the motors at the rear, the wing root is 1 block thick, same for the nose's sides, 1 thick, and i cant move it inwards otherwise it would be visible on the other side, same for the spine
the hole in the spine has been fixed on the next version
and yes, i only complain about when the exposed motorlock is fully exposed
