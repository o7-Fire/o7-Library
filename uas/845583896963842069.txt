bug-reports 2023-07-07 04:26:21 uhh
bug-reports 2023-07-07 04:26:28 cuz idk how to send screenshots
bug-reports 2023-07-07 04:27:03 smart
bug-reports 2023-07-07 04:29:03 what's that?
bug-reports 2023-07-07 04:29:12 game updating again
bug-reports 2023-07-07 04:29:17 oh no
bug-reports 2023-07-07 04:30:54 fun fact: error code is actually 267, not 69, error code 69 is just smth added by devs https://streamable.com/2f6940
bug-reports 2023-07-07 04:32:12 i guess
bug-reports 2023-07-07 04:33:10 is that roblox?
bug-reports 2023-07-07 04:38:10 very possible
bug-reports 2023-07-07 04:38:25 why
bug-reports 2023-07-07 04:38:36 proof?
bug-reports 2023-07-07 04:39:26 but the actual error code is 267
bug-reports 2023-07-07 04:39:41 code 69 is just the reason of kick
bug-reports 2023-07-07 04:39:51 and maybe writen by devs
bug-reports 2023-07-07 04:40:04 first, the actual code is in brackets
bug-reports 2023-07-07 04:40:23 and in "Error Code", E and C is capital
bug-reports 2023-07-07 04:40:40 In the code 69, letter c isn't capital
bug-reports 2023-07-07 04:41:50 so I said it might be smth by the devs
bug-reports 2023-07-07 04:41:55 I never said 100%
bug-reports 2023-07-07 04:42:28 but why would there be 2 error codes? and 1 of them don't seems to be real code by roblox
bug-reports 2023-07-07 04:42:54 well, idk that cuz I aint developer
bug-reports 2023-07-07 04:43:26 but there would be a chance that's smth by devs on purpose
bug-reports 2023-07-07 04:45:27 they seems to work on me
bug-reports 2023-07-07 04:45:37 do you have anchor block

creations-chat 2023-07-13 17:08:47 How's my Titanic? Not yet finish coloring tho, but rate it for now plsss (15k blocks)

creations-chat 2023-07-13 17:14:14 O_O  omg thank you!!!
creations-chat 2023-07-13 17:16:31 I made a few life boats, and I haven't finish coloring, but I will try lightening thw windows thx  (I didn't put grey emoji, the ship is grey cuz i havent finish coloring, also, how do I add lines?)
creations-chat 2023-07-16 18:25:35 anyone know how to get my build to hall of frame?
bot-central 2023-07-16 18:33:02 !rank
creations-chat 2023-07-17 08:34:47 Oh, that's the fireman staircase, as the veery front of the ship
creations-chat 2023-07-17 08:37:15 I finally know this community is a piece of sh*t
creations-chat 2023-07-17 08:42:19 I see, thx!
creations-chat 2023-07-17 08:44:23 Not bad, but the bow could use more triangle wedge
creations-chat 2023-07-17 08:46:53 I mean use more triangle wedge, and try using different size of them, not just 1x2 or 1x3 or 1x4 (idk)
creations-chat 2023-07-17 08:49:28 It's this kind of ppl who ruin the community
creations-chat 2023-07-17 09:08:07 Yeh, they forgot they were white before
creations-chat 2023-07-17 09:15:32 Don't be toxic
creations-chat 2023-07-17 09:18:55 Not meant to be funny, you shouldn't take it as a joke too, this is serious and could cause any consequences
creations-chat 2023-07-17 09:22:15 First I don't understand what are you talking about, second if you mean I am new to here, then does that mean having more experiences could be mean?

Edited: I meant I don't understand what you are saying, and if you mean I am new to this community, does that mean being experienced could be rude?
creations-chat 2023-07-17 09:25:06 I wouldn't prefer staying away from problems than standing up and let the others know what shouldn't be done
creations-chat 2023-07-17 09:27:16 I am here, asking you to talk nicely, instead of being rude to anything anyone says. That's what I am doing now.
creations-chat 2023-07-17 09:29:53 Surely it's your choice to be rude to others, but I am telling you that, I am feeling uncomfortable with what you are doing now. If you don't decide to stop it, I will have to do something about it.
creations-chat 2023-07-17 09:33:16 Thank you, then can we please stop this argument and let people to try really use this channel to share their builds, instead of having arguments like this?
creations-chat 2023-07-17 09:35:24 Atleast there are still people who tries to share their builds to others in this channel
creations-chat 2023-07-17 09:43:55 Never expect a fair voting within such communities, you just have to know there are ppl who would appreciate your creations, and as long as you put I enough effort, that's a good build. The votes are just nothing
creations-chat 2023-07-17 09:48:06 I mean, in communities with "ranking discrimination" would never have a fair voting
creations-chat 2023-07-17 09:50:34 Cool, I like the funnels, it looks like the real one
creations-chat 2023-07-17 09:55:13 Oh thanks!
creations-chat 2023-07-17 10:17:17 Should I follow the real titanic or add some random details?
creations-chat 2023-07-17 10:19:21 Oh ok
creations-chat 2023-07-17 10:29:05 yeh sure if you have enough saving slot lol
