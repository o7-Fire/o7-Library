creations-chat 2022-09-25 04:52:16 ? Who are you talking to ?
creations-chat 2022-09-25 04:55:22 You think my mig31 is a Import? No, its Just a plane I use in neo-warfare alot so I built one out of boredom.
creations-chat 2022-09-25 04:59:33 <@287454032250011649> Could you elaborate why you downvoted?
creations-chat 2022-09-25 05:03:32 Why are you un-intellegent.
creations-chat 2022-09-25 05:09:45 Thank you for pointing it out. üôè
creations-chat 2022-09-25 05:12:31 Cause its a lego game? ü•∫ , Also <@707133341454958604> Yes, a few T-72s were granted permission to Kit out and decorate their tanks. And a image arround the internet surfaced of a Stealthy black t72 with the flag of NovoRus, It has since been destroyed most likely though.
creations-chat 2022-09-25 05:14:38 I have built in shaders (that just add Bloom and sunlight) I cant remove it unless i reinstall roblox. Also which build are you talking about? MIG31 or t72. I am not a plane builder by any means , I built the plane cause I like its performance in pfts neo warfare.
creations-chat 2022-09-25 05:27:10 Yes. yknow what, Im deleting the post since people cant see the missles at the bottom are plane crazy stuff And the materials

creations-chat 2022-10-01 01:36:11 300 upvotes is  Comparitivly easy , the donkey copter got like 400, some average joe (the term and the actual plane crazy player) can just post something that is semi funny and get upvotes
creations-chat 2022-10-01 01:39:04 so overused you posted that like 9 times already? also proof 300-200+ upvotes are relatively easy: https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/384025409945337856/1023460680264855592
creations-chat 2022-10-01 01:41:58 i said 300 neve 400 upvotes are Comparitivly easy in the grand aspect of things, not from my pov from the pcc pov as a whole. just post something funny , with semi detail and it will get upvotes.
creations-chat 2022-10-01 01:48:11 the simpler times when standards werent high and people didnt take everything serious
<@720751430595772418> The building qaulity in creations is low, not the standards, if the standards lowered  the same creations in <#384025409945337856>  would be getting upvoted

creations-chat 2022-10-30 00:45:55 I used the late t55 Composite hull, since i was gonna make a t55(with the drozd aps),
I  changed it up, made a it-1, gave it a sick magnet system , and called it a day
creations-chat 2022-10-30 00:49:03 Sorry my leige for making a pvp tank and not wasting 3 days on something that wasnt evne made for detail in the first place bbg

creations-chat 2022-10-30 15:40:29 PCC Standards did not drop,
This narrative was inacted by random "Expert Roles"
Do not believe that narrative. STANDARDS, did not drop.
creations-chat 2022-10-31 13:43:51 I'm not the first to make this nor the last, basically there is a huge super motor locked "Computer system" of magnets in a circular disc.
They are hooked up To Meta Contols (So they can work with a joystick like a real life MCLOS early cold war atgm)

The magnets work together to steer the missle and there is a medium in-between the missle ( A wire / rope) that's attached to insure magnet guidance is kept up. It looses its potency after 400 blocks - 300 blocks. But tank pvp is that close so I'm not complaining.

Credits to: Boxness, Van and Yielding for the idea. 

The supercomputer is alooot of magnets in a circular motion I forgot how many.
Due to this I have to anchor lol  or I'd crash and lag out

TLDR: I used old hitbox glitch , IQ, magnets, and realism to make the ATGM

creations-chat 2022-12-07 14:32:11 It does deserve its down votes cause it's all SHIT and 1 block jet builders will be phased out of their service üò° (unless it's actually good )
creations-chat 2022-12-07 14:34:27 lol 1x1 jets look shit and from future haste they will all be down voted until their upload rate in creations is lower.

I mean it's already low but people still post (that shitty j20 on question) and 2 block jet builders need lebensraum

Some people try to bypass the 1 block jet hate by making it thicker but it still looks equally as shitty
