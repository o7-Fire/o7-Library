creations-chat 2022-04-14 15:06:49 you could align the furthest parts from the chair with camera lock, motorlocking the main chair and assemble others with angle lock, but it will rob your braincells
creations-chat 2022-04-14 15:12:04 first you need to leave blocks that cameras supposed to point to cuz angled cameras easily reset its direction when saved and re-loaded.
the main principles of camera locking is angled cameras always get welded with main pilot chair, so you can float up the chair a few blocks with lock tower and stick the tricky parts onto it
creations-chat 2022-04-14 15:15:24 dreadnought or the corvette (transport i thik will be the hardest, you should fit the angled sides exactly)

creations-chat 2022-07-09 15:21:57 OK BRUH i just found out my engine nozzle should be 2.5x2.5 so need to piston lock everything
creations-chat 2022-07-09 15:24:24 this was 3x3
creations-chat 2022-07-09 16:15:33 prob solved
creations-chat 2022-07-09 16:42:11 so the vertical lock is the moving part, it uses axles in the blue circle. yellow ones in the second pic is motor2s. only the middle motor is connected directly to the nozzle which does horizontal movement.
(i couldn't avoid moving the wrong part since the whole lock tower moves together with the nozzle)

plus its very heavy, causing motor2s shake so added helium on the tip... requires more improvement
creations-chat 2022-07-09 16:44:50 ur welcome ✨

creations-chat 2022-08-12 09:07:17 1: your window isnt angled custom and doesnt have frames, you can learn to make them with trails.
2: use a tip jet or fake rotor method to create realistic rotors.
3: the thickness of the tail boom in that real helicopter should be decreasing from fuselage to tail. merge two angled cylinders and block the gaps between with text blocks would help

creations-chat 2022-12-04 19:04:56 <@525589603319676948> idk if it will match with the wheel size, but i think it would look better if you make the chassis half block higher
creations-chat 2022-12-06 14:17:03 well, uncool things about roscale is that they're too simplified and sometimes people intend to stick with some 'formula' with the bones of the build. summarizing motorlocks as simple as possible but keeping detail in an impossible level of grade (same with functions) is the key of making a good roscale build. try to make more things and always keep away from the solid principles, it's necessary to get experience from failure such as miscalculation of space, wrong proportions, or some malfunctioning mechanics.
in your current build just push the intake shadow block backwards or paint the motor black to give some depth and adjust canopy angels with piston lock in order to make smooth curves. i recommend you TNT locking to avoid bugs, jammed springs, disconnector parts sticking outside.

creations-chat 2023-01-18 09:15:58 thats just not stabilized properly then
creations-chat 2023-01-18 09:19:39 as i said, watch helicopter basics. neither its powered by engines or custom rotors what stabilises it is up to tail fin placement(mostly)
creations-chat 2023-01-18 09:21:44 I've tried it once, the hardest isnt the rotors but gathering the tail in a cone shape
