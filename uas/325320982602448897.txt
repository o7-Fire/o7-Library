bot-central 2019-08-16 00:20:53 and they get the GI bill once they get out, which they can use towards furthering their education
bot-central 2019-08-16 00:22:27 there's always other jobs
bot-central 2019-08-16 00:22:42 such as farm hands, construction workers, lumberjacks, etc.

bot-central 2019-08-16 00:31:50 to quote the encyclopedia britannica: "Libertarianism, political philosophy that takes individual liberty to be the primary political value."
bot-central 2019-08-16 00:32:02 liberty can be construed in mutliple ways
bot-central 2019-08-16 00:32:24 such as the liberty to bear arms, secede, self-govern, run a business, etc.
bot-central 2019-08-16 00:32:45 items that impede such liberty include licensing, taxing, and regulation
bot-central 2019-08-16 00:32:53 such as the homeless tax

creations-chat 2020-02-22 03:42:47 because air gets cold when you move fast
creations-chat 2020-02-22 03:42:53 and gets colder the higher you go
creations-chat 2020-02-22 03:42:57 especially in europe
creations-chat 2020-02-22 03:43:04 hence thicc clothes
creations-chat 2020-02-22 03:43:41 90 mph is still pretty fast

creations-chat 2020-02-22 03:44:08 you ever stick your hand out the window on the freeway?

creations-chat 2020-02-22 03:44:39 you could probably expect at most like 2000 ft operational altitude at the time
creations-chat 2020-02-22 03:44:45 which can be pretty chilly
creations-chat 2020-02-22 03:45:02 also the scarf doesn't compare to the thicc flight cap and tunic
creations-chat 2020-02-22 03:45:12 it's a creature comfort pretty much
creations-chat 2020-02-22 03:45:35 minimum safe altitude before oxygen requirement is 12500
creations-chat 2020-02-22 03:45:50 and with a lawnmower engine and canvas airfoil, getting up that high takes literal hours

creations-chat 2020-02-22 03:46:04 doubt the pilot would last long
creations-chat 2020-02-22 03:46:13 especially because it takes forever to get that high
creations-chat 2020-02-22 03:46:17 especially at highway speeds
creations-chat 2020-02-22 03:46:56 max altitude you can expect when your goal is to take photos, and shoot pilots is at most 5000 feet
