bug-reports 2020-06-09 15:10:33 There is this saving issue where when you paint glass to white, the colour doesn't save and the glass resets to this blue colour.
bug-reports 2020-06-09 15:10:57 This bug existed for a long time
bug-reports 2020-06-09 15:11:35 It's also triggering
bug-reports 2020-06-09 17:16:20 Only some of the glass blocks save for me.
bug-reports 2020-06-09 17:17:04 Just to make sure i am not using legacy
bug-reports 2020-06-09 17:20:10 So far i have experimented and found out it's the wegdes.
bug-reports 2020-06-09 17:20:25 1x1
bug-reports 2020-06-09 17:20:38 and half wedge downs

bug-reports 2020-06-09 17:31:01

bug-reports 2020-06-09 17:32:25 Never happened to me
bug-reports 2020-06-09 17:33:13 Must be a saving ussue

bug-reports 2020-06-09 17:37:22 I have no idea what the limit materials block is
bug-reports 2020-06-09 17:39:03 In my time of playing plane crazy, the only thing that i can think of is the paint block
bug-reports 2020-06-09 17:39:34 <:pogey:651848693842182144>
bug-reports 2020-06-09 17:42:12 For what?
bug-reports 2020-06-09 17:43:53 For the glass saving issue it's usually the 1X1 wegde, the half wedge down and that's it.
bug-reports 2020-06-09 17:45:43 place multiple wedges
bug-reports 2020-06-09 17:45:53 
bug-reports 2020-06-09 17:47:03 How many wedges did you place?
bug-reports 2020-06-09 17:47:37 I believe there are 12 1X1 wedges on my build
bug-reports 2020-06-09 17:50:17 Anyways, I have to go now.
bug-reports 2020-06-10 17:06:56 Happened to me many times.
