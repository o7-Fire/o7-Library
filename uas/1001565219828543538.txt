creations-chat 2023-06-07 03:05:42 well, in my opinion i meant that tutorials suck if your only just copying it and not learning anything, but how you have explained it it makes this felon tutorial valid to be used, as it is being used to learn how to do motorlock and other things to create good looking planes. Thank you for explaining, <@396515096693833729>
