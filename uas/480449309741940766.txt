The Tale of wermthewerm (480449309741940766)
help 2019-09-14 20:40:53 I dunno if this really counts as help needing
help 2019-09-14 20:41:23 But how do i make things rotate vertically instead of horizontally? Is there even a way to do that?
help 2019-09-14 20:41:51 Yes
help 2019-09-14 20:42:05 I mean like
help 2019-09-14 20:42:11 The motor
help 2019-09-14 20:42:16 Rotates things horizontally
help 2019-09-14 20:42:17 Regardless
help 2019-09-14 20:42:21 of the position it is in
help 2019-09-14 20:42:38 Is there any way to make the motor rotate vertically?
help 2019-09-14 20:42:51 How?
help 2019-09-14 20:42:57 I know how to turn it and all
help 2019-09-14 20:43:07 It legit always rotates horizontally.
help 2019-09-14 20:43:54 i have it positioned like that, turns sideways
help 2019-09-14 20:44:49 Positioned the motor like this, rotates horizontally but can make vertical things
help 2019-09-14 20:44:57 In a sense
help 2019-09-14 20:45:17 as this was the original position
help 2019-09-14 20:45:21 But it is not the rotation i am looking for
help 2019-09-14 20:45:36 Think of how a hammer is pulled back then forwards
help 2019-09-14 20:45:40 That's what i want to do
help 2019-09-14 20:45:55 Like make the motor rotate attached objects *vertically*
help 2019-09-14 20:46:06 It literally does not matter what position i try
help 2019-09-14 20:46:28 Do you not know what vertically means
help 2019-09-14 20:47:11 Yeah
help 2019-09-14 20:47:16 That's what i mean
help 2019-09-14 20:47:31 Yes.
help 2019-09-14 20:47:35 Yes.
help 2019-09-14 20:48:11 So what rotation should i use to get my wanted result?
help 2019-09-14 20:51:44 I doubt it even IS possible.
help 2019-09-14 20:52:17 <@!352928457358835715>
help 2019-09-14 20:52:28 I've tried T and Y rotations alike.
help 2019-09-14 20:52:38 I have to resort to other ideas instead.
help 2019-09-14 20:55:58 ._.
help 2019-09-14 20:56:13 I'm stupid.
help 2019-09-14 20:57:09 Exactly what i needed, thanks <@!352928457358835715>.
help 2019-09-14 21:00:20 I have run into another problem
help 2019-09-14 21:00:34 The disconnector will not disconnect the plane, it simply refuses to.
help 2019-09-14 21:01:04 It just doesn't no matter what i bind it to.
help 2019-09-14 21:01:34 Oh
help 2019-09-14 21:01:41 It was due to the fin tthing
help 2019-09-14 21:05:01 I've come across some anomaly.
help 2019-09-14 21:05:14 There's no center of lift, i have wing panels and all but NO center of lift
help 2019-09-14 21:05:43 <@!352928457358835715> I made a back-up, but how does this not have a center of lift?
help 2019-09-14 21:06:05 Thanks
help 2019-09-14 21:06:33 Still, too front heavy and i do not know how i can make this small plane be not front heavy
help 2019-09-14 21:06:49 I don't wanna make an enormous plane tho
help 2019-09-14 21:07:22 I'm gonna make it bigger.
help 2019-09-14 21:07:35 I hope the launcher can withstand the weight.
help 2019-09-14 21:09:37 Still too heavy.
help 2019-09-14 21:10:09 Wouldn't that add more back weight?
help 2019-09-14 21:10:25 And besides, the plane is ALREADY too heavy for my little launcher.
help 2019-09-14 21:10:30 I may have to scrap the idea all together.
help 2019-09-14 21:11:25 Gonna make a missile launcher instead.
help 2019-09-14 21:14:09 Nevermind.
help 2019-09-14 21:20:10 The delta wings are doing nothing, i literally cannot control where this rocket fork goes at all whatsoever, what can i do to control it?
help 2019-09-14 21:21:47 <@163143541160148992> Can you help me?
help 2019-09-14 21:22:14 I mean, i did try.
help 2019-09-14 21:22:35 Do i go manually set keybinds to every control surface?
help 2019-09-14 21:23:01 what does lower and raise surface mean
help 2019-09-14 21:23:40 What do they mean? It'd be cool if you didn't bruh me every time i ask a question.
help 2019-09-14 21:25:16 Well, that did not help i'd say, i just ended up turning it into a rotating rocket fork
help 2019-09-14 21:26:01 Oh.
help 2019-09-14 21:27:02 Nice job being so toxic.
help 2019-09-14 21:27:12 Good to know i'm accepted in this community.
help 2019-09-14 21:27:31 It wasn't even my idea
help 2019-09-14 21:28:09 If only there was a roblox community that didn't get mad at you for not knowing how to do something.
help 2019-09-14 21:28:40 That's why i said "if only"
creations-chat 2019-09-14 21:29:33 >best i've made is just a simple propeller plane that you can make in like 2 minutes absolute max
creations-chat 2019-09-14 21:31:10 mfw everyone is a god at building while your only working build is a simple propeller plane
creations-chat 2019-09-14 21:32:32 <@!212105708206948355> That's godly compared to anything i could make within 10000000 hourus
creations-chat 2019-09-14 21:58:00 I made a little suspension car (i am a beginner at this, sorry), i'm proud of it. It doesn't rotate well but it's a pretty cool boio
creations-chat 2019-09-14 21:59:09 A little propeller plane i made, seen in flight too.
creations-chat 2019-09-15 12:14:30 Rocket Plane with wheels, you drive forwards with the wheels, disconnect them when you feel like it and you get a full rocket plane
creations-chat 2019-09-15 12:16:04 Rocket Plane in flight
creations-chat 2019-09-15 12:24:25 Rocket Plane lifting off just after detatching legs (i put the rockets in on and off only mode so yeah)
Requested Rank: Designer 2 (got 7 upvotes on propeller plane thing)
creations-chat 2019-09-15 12:24:53 Oh
creations-chat 2019-09-15 12:25:04 Why does nobody tell me these things?
creations-chat 2019-09-15 12:25:15 <@456226577798135808> Why do you need an uncropped image, though?
creations-chat 2019-09-15 12:25:46 Okay.
creations-chat 2019-09-15 12:26:42 Is infinite fuel considered cheating?
creations-chat 2019-09-15 12:27:27 Uncropped image, you can see one of the detatched wheels + the rocket plane flying
Requested role: Designer 2 (7 upvotes on propeller plane)
creations-chat 2019-09-15 12:28:00 It's a bit low quality due to my print screen commiting robloc + desktop
creations-chat 2019-09-15 12:28:23 But anyway, is there anything bad about it?
creations-chat 2019-09-15 12:28:27 <@456226577798135808>
creations-chat 2019-09-15 12:28:55 Yes.
creations-chat 2019-09-15 12:30:23 Okay so i can't be satisfied at my beginner creations now, i know its a square with wings and engines, do you expect beginners to be able to make the RMS Titanic except it can become a tank?
creations-chat 2019-09-15 12:30:30 <@!267393167228141568>
creations-chat 2019-09-15 12:31:08 Exactly, let me be proud of my own little creations, no need to come in being captain obvious.
Sorry, i'm a bit mad rn and youre forgiven
creations-chat 2019-09-15 12:32:22 I'm afraid to ping a moderator to get the designer 2 role, i don't want the mods to rage at me.
creations-chat 2019-09-15 12:33:20 wdym
creations-chat 2019-09-15 12:33:39 so i @ a mod but idk what i ask the mod
creations-chat 2019-09-15 12:34:03 Also where do you get the "i read the rules" rule
creations-chat 2019-09-15 12:34:31 <@456226577798135808>
creations-chat 2019-09-15 12:34:33 i mean role
creations-chat 2019-09-15 12:48:26 Do i NEED to request ranks?
creations-chat 2019-09-15 12:49:30 Also i don't get why people downvote creations for no reason
