bug-reports 2020-06-14 02:20:52 Motors; 

When set to "lock", the motor flings. Idk why. It's annoying. REALLY annoying.

Not sure if it's a bug or made like that on purpose.
bug-reports 2020-06-14 22:30:46 material paint on signs does not save; it resets to wood every time i re load it
bug-reports 2020-06-18 20:11:24 I know it's not a bug, but it makes my life really hard. PLEASE remove the motor's ability to decalibrate and come off it's base. It ruins most of my builds.

bug-reports 2020-07-01 21:12:18 Only those that the devs deem as "skilled builders" are allowed to submit suggestions and not to get their bug reports ignored.... like... what's the point in creating that channel if most of us can't chat there?

bug-reports 2020-08-05 01:42:03 Can't paint material on water wheels
the-dump 2020-08-15 01:01:12 comedy
bug-reports 2020-08-28 20:05:27 •If you try to open a trap door while your build is anchored with physics off, the trap door will be jammed for everyone else.

•If you collide with a part that's dense enough at a high enough speed, you will be able to kill the altimeter, speed-o-meter or even crash the server.

•Paint on jet engine "wheels" will not save.

•You can't paint material on water wheels.
bug-reports 2020-08-28 20:43:09 •If my build is not anchored, it will shake. A lot. I mean it. It will yeet you into kingdom come.

bot-central 2020-09-25 00:07:15 -mapsuggest To be honest, just flying around the map without going anywhere gets kind of boring. I suggest using the terrain from a game that I found and adding missions that can get you new plane building parts.

bug-reports 2021-01-11 05:11:48 From time to time motorlocked parts will appear attached correctly for the client that created the build and will appear phased into the part that it's supposed to be attached to
bug-reports 2021-01-11 05:12:25 For example when someone manages to teleport to his/her plot while sitting on the seat of annother person's build
bug-reports 2021-01-11 05:13:06 The seat along with the part that is force attached to it will be dragged to the building space of the person in question
bug-reports 2021-01-11 05:13:37 sometimes when you respawn you will be phased through the ground and you get flung right off of the building platform
bug-reports 2021-01-11 05:15:52 If you fly/lag enough landing gear wheels will detach from the pole that it's attached to when you restract/extend it

creations-chat 2021-05-21 01:16:11 Hey
Got anything to say about the plane I sent in <#384025409945337856> ? You seem to have downvoted the post for some reason
creations-chat 2021-05-21 01:18:56 Oke
creations-chat 2021-05-29 00:27:32 it's called anchor blocks
creations-chat 2022-04-27 21:33:56 it was supposed to be an a340 pls no bully
creations-chat 2022-04-27 21:36:13 you got any ideas on how i could improve it then
also that thing is from a year ago the current version is blue
creations-chat 2022-04-27 21:50:09 this is the updated version i was talking about
im still working on the proportions but the wings are just a lost cause
creations-chat 2022-04-27 21:53:59 ok
the-dump 2022-07-01 15:37:04 so squishy
creations-chat 2022-08-05 16:01:35 decided to remake my plane's cabin 
anything i could improve?
creations-chat 2022-08-05 16:05:18 too many seats?
creations-chat 2022-08-05 16:08:06 you think there's too many of them?
creations-chat 2022-08-05 16:10:40 ok ty
creations-chat 2022-08-06 03:02:09 it's too small imo and the nose subtly curves upwards if you look carefully
help 2022-08-15 09:21:17 is there a gradual acceleration mechanic for motors?
creations-chat 2022-08-20 08:34:36 the canopy is too round imo but pretty good otherwise
creations-chat 2022-09-08 00:41:53 fuselage isnt long enough
wings arent long enough
the vertical stabilizer is too small
creations-chat 2022-09-08 00:51:31 maybe larger engines they look kinda small in comparison to the fuselage
bot-central 2022-09-10 19:58:33 !shelp
bot-central 2022-09-10 20:01:31 ?rhelp
creations-chat 2022-10-02 18:28:30 it's an artistic choice but how about the plane
thank you very much for your feedback i will make sure to consume it from within
creations-chat 2022-10-14 00:58:52 🧽 😁 👍 Teehee!
creations-chat 2022-10-14 01:32:19 dont know how to motorlock
might consider doing it at some point in the distant future
creations-chat 2022-10-15 18:43:58 sounds like a you issue
creations-chat 2022-10-15 18:47:48 its 2 towers the hell are you mad at wth
creations-chat 2022-10-27 00:41:03 it would have looked better without motorlock 
tbh maybe if you added more details it might have looked better
creations-chat 2022-10-27 00:50:52 even for a beginner playing on an ipad its underwhelming
creations-chat 2022-10-27 01:05:13 ops
creations-chat 2022-10-27 01:07:40 it doesnt deserve to be liked you could have made it a gazillion times better by not motor locking it
if the sole purpose of the build was practising motorlock then ok but in terms of looks it looks like balls
creations-chat 2022-10-27 01:14:09 take one good look at your build and tell me with a straight face that it looks good
that's what im saying

creations-chat 2022-12-30 00:53:32 - engines are tiny
- winglets are huge
- paper wings
creations-chat 2022-12-30 00:58:57 a lack of detail in relation to the original reference causing it to look like a double winged sausage
