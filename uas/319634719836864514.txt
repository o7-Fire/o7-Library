creations-chat 2020-04-29 10:52:59 But I base what's bad and good off of what actually takes effort to make
creations-chat 2020-04-29 10:53:11 and dubstep takes little to no effort
creations-chat 2020-04-29 10:53:17 It's literally samples

creations-chat 2020-04-29 10:54:43 pop music is the easiest of music
creations-chat 2020-04-29 10:54:55 literally the same instruments and repeated Chords
