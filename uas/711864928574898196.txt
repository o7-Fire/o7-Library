creations-chat 2021-01-27 12:07:37 im used to making fighter/multi role air superiority jets, thats the first bomber ive made
creations-chat 2021-01-27 12:11:26 it was the best i could do
bug-reports 2021-01-27 12:12:56 it might be due to server stability if it was changed recently
bug-reports 2021-01-27 12:13:15 or did you recently change any pc hardware?
bug-reports 2021-01-27 12:16:59 i have no clue then

bug-reports 2021-01-27 12:20:22 unless rickje could e bothered there is no saving it unless you rebuild it
bug-reports 2021-01-27 12:21:56 thats either
1. server lag

bug-reports 2021-01-27 12:22:40 thats a rendering problem on your hardware

creations-chat 2021-01-27 14:43:08 OH LMAO
help 2021-01-27 14:47:58 yo this barrechor guy is going out of his way to say my builds are bad in dms and now in <#504436696021204992> , that argument stopped ages ago and he is just bringing it back up
creations-chat 2021-01-27 14:54:40 what builds?
creations-chat 2021-01-27 14:57:07 well my tomcat got 20 ish upvotes but my avro that took longer got 41 downvotes, granted my tomcat looks better but i prefer my avro and some people absolutly despise it for no reason whatsoever. it is just jokes at this point
creations-chat 2021-01-27 15:00:26 ik its not great but i think it was hard work, again like i said 3 times alr i make multi role fighter jets not bombers, thats my first bomber, and you can see the clear difference between my jet and bomber, but for a first time, its not bad
creations-chat 2021-01-27 15:08:14 lol
creations-chat 2021-01-27 15:10:15 i like it but its also an abomination but it does look kool, only problem, wings come off easy
creations-chat 2021-01-27 15:12:17 id give it the raptor camo and it would look 100 x better
creations-chat 2021-01-27 15:14:18 also id change the name, f-24 seems to generic, and it undermines the original f-22
creations-chat 2021-01-27 15:20:46 is that a tiger 1?
help 2021-01-27 16:45:44 aight i blocked him its gucci

creations-chat 2022-12-18 17:19:28 light blue-140,178,200 dark blue-100,134,155 grey-122,122,132
creations-chat 2022-12-18 17:26:59 anyone who downvoted my f-14 could you let me know whats up with it so i could try to fix it
creations-chat 2022-12-18 17:30:35 people hate f-14s for some reason
creations-chat 2022-12-18 17:32:54 ok ill keep that in mind next time i do it
