help 2023-06-19 21:57:51 Need an idea from another experienced builder
help 2023-06-19 21:58:18 for a difficult build Ive been working on, I need something compact that would force a build instantly straight up with a limited force
help 2023-06-19 21:58:21 like a "jump"
help 2023-06-19 21:59:03 and no not motorlocked rockets or something like that, that makes it accelerate, Id need an instant speed up, for only a moment
help 2023-06-19 22:00:05 sure, what kind of held do you need?
help 2023-06-19 22:07:03 ok so, in your image, you used a lot of control surfaces over the entire wing. This creates lift, but not really the actual lift that will give you the control you want
help 2023-06-19 22:07:10 Ill make a little demo and post a picture in a sec
help 2023-06-19 22:10:41 
help 2023-06-19 22:10:55 so in this image, you can see the control surfaces around the back wing panels
help 2023-06-19 22:11:03 those control surfaces need to be off, like so
help 2023-06-19 22:11:12 
help 2023-06-19 22:11:43 Because we will be using a motor 2 to move the entire back wing panels
help 2023-06-19 22:11:53 basically making 1 really big control surface that is way stronger
help 2023-06-19 22:12:17 
help 2023-06-19 22:12:25 that one right there below my character
help 2023-06-19 22:12:38 
help 2023-06-19 22:13:07 make your control surfaces just normal wings, and just have the really big one we are making in the back
help 2023-06-19 22:13:34 depending on how you will turn, you may want more. but we will stick to getting 1 work for now
help 2023-06-19 22:13:52 those controls are for the motor 2 that will be a big control surface
help 2023-06-19 22:14:14 at the back of your tails wings
help 2023-06-19 22:14:32 just put them at the back of your wings
help 2023-06-19 22:15:51 yeah
