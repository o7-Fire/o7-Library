plane-crazy 2020-06-23 04:49:24 how did this not burn
plane-crazy 2020-06-23 04:42:40 the power of dark magic
plane-crazy 2020-06-23 04:41:29 anybody want to see a cursed photo?
plane-crazy 2020-06-23 00:42:54 finna get yeeted into another dimension
plane-crazy 2020-06-23 00:42:33 yeah so imagine that on rockets
plane-crazy 2020-06-23 00:42:12 damn
plane-crazy 2020-06-23 00:41:34 water jets can fling people at 15k studs per second so imagine getting hit by it when its moving with a super rocket engine
plane-crazy 2020-06-23 00:39:37 put waterjet instead of lava spitter if you really want to fling someone
plane-crazy 2020-06-23 00:38:50 flings anything that gets close and burns anything thats outside of fling range
plane-crazy 2020-06-23 00:37:43 <@!554109080873205762> https://streamable.com/dzrpb2
plane-crazy 2020-06-23 00:33:15 Basically anybody who gets close to it flung and any creation near it is shredded
plane-crazy 2020-06-23 00:30:42 Sure one sec
plane-crazy 2020-06-23 00:19:53 Make a anchored block with a motor on top with unpowered, then put a normal block on top, then add 2 suspension at max length and max stiffness and put normal blocks on the end of those. On the normal blocks put 2 in one direction and 2 in the opposite direction for the other, then put super rocket engines on the back and add lava spitters on the 2 blocks to make a force field
plane-crazy 2020-06-23 00:17:10 Lava spitters
plane-crazy 2020-06-23 00:16:48 Mr quacker5 made a 25 block helicopter
plane-crazy 2020-06-23 00:04:59 I am out
plane-crazy 2020-06-23 00:04:55 We need many save slots
plane-crazy 2020-06-23 00:04:46 Yes
plane-crazy 2020-06-23 00:01:48 Bruh they are under the pvp weapons category <:KEKW:670310537300672528>
plane-crazy 2020-06-22 23:59:22 Or you can change the keybind
plane-crazy 2020-06-22 23:59:13 Press f to use them in private or pvp server
plane-crazy 2020-06-22 23:58:15 F
plane-crazy 2020-06-22 23:57:42 What’s the dude behind you building tho
plane-crazy 2020-06-22 23:57:31 Looks cool
plane-crazy 2020-06-22 11:30:09 i made a watercooler XD
plane-crazy 2020-06-22 11:29:26 if you put guns behind the water jets it looks cooler then normal guns
plane-crazy 2020-06-22 09:00:36 I made a car wash with the summer items the jets for water and lava for deep cleaning
plane-crazy 2020-06-22 08:54:51 Someone should make a washing machine with the water jets
plane-crazy 2020-06-22 08:53:51 Water jets are more of a power washer then a pvp weapon
plane-crazy 2020-06-22 08:52:22 We need the water jet front cylinder thing as a gun
plane-crazy 2020-06-22 08:51:28 What’s backwards
plane-crazy 2020-06-22 08:50:33 Just as like a bonus feature
plane-crazy 2020-06-22 08:50:25 It would be cool if waterjets could turn corroded metal into normal metal
plane-crazy 2020-06-22 08:49:30 ?
plane-crazy 2020-06-22 08:49:07 
plane-crazy 2020-06-22 08:48:51 Water jets shouldn’t be pvp they should be decoration like snow pipe or sparklers
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 22:01:23 Sometimes 2 people spawn in the same base
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 21:31:32 They are hacking
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 21:31:27 I can explain
plane-crazy 2020-06-16 21:13:43 This one dude built a battleship with metal plating and my rockets did nothing against it
plane-crazy 2020-06-16 21:12:44 Diamond plating
plane-crazy 2020-06-05 10:09:56 so i made a 500+ version
plane-crazy 2020-06-05 10:09:33 you guys didnt like this little 270+ block sub
plane-crazy 2020-06-05 08:27:09 how the hell did you get a boat on the island
plane-crazy 2020-06-05 08:09:23 ohio class submarine
plane-crazy 2020-06-04 02:50:55 Not a tutorial
plane-crazy 2020-06-03 23:27:02 i want to build a different plane with it
plane-crazy 2020-06-03 23:26:44 oh wait i did
plane-crazy 2020-06-03 23:26:17 never though about that
plane-crazy 2020-06-03 23:26:08 wow
plane-crazy 2020-06-03 23:25:53 what should i build with the plane body
plane-crazy 2020-06-03 23:23:33 what do i build with this
plane-crazy 2020-05-28 10:51:33 Someone made a siren head on crack because it looked like it was having a seizure
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 07:25:37 who said dinosaurs cant fly
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 09:55:43 It would make it easier to connect creations
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 09:54:25 Basically they would be cables that could attach to other people’s creations, it would be useful for folds, it would work kind of like the ropes except they had one end like a grapple hook
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 09:53:18 The hook cables
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 09:53:01 Idk why
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 09:52:58 Yeah
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 09:52:13 I made a suggestion and it got 75+ upvotes but then it disappeared form the chat and was never seen again
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 09:51:11 How do you take screenshots with the new menu
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 09:50:14 Want to see the worst plane in existence
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 09:46:45 I offer something horrible, if you miss outline use legacy glass and then when your done turn it back to what ever material you were using, it’s not pretty or preferable but at least you get the outlines back
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 06:52:19 To this
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 06:52:16 Went from this
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 05:21:09 Introducing the worst F-22 in existence
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 05:17:01 Who wants to see the worst F-22 in existence
plane-crazy 2020-05-15 04:47:21 Can’t even have gravity these days
plane-crazy 2020-05-14 21:09:50 I want them but honestly I feel they are overpriced
plane-crazy 2020-05-14 21:08:06 <@!610586741224636442> they literally added speaker blocks for 300 robux
plane-crazy 2020-05-14 20:35:31 How the hell do people get neon texture
plane-crazy 2020-05-14 10:39:41 
plane-crazy 2020-05-14 10:39:29 Aight
plane-crazy 2020-05-14 10:39:25 Hmm
plane-crazy 2020-05-08 04:05:24 i'd prefer a boat
plane-crazy 2020-05-08 04:05:17 i need suggestions
plane-crazy 2020-05-08 04:05:11 i want to make something but idk what to make
