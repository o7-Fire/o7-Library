the-dump 2018-11-22 13:38:28 oof
bug-reports 2022-02-22 03:12:56 I'm not sure if it's a bug or not but whenever I blow up other vehicles in pvp my game is fine, but the second my vehicle blows up I just crash immediately
bug-reports 2022-02-22 12:56:24 My pc can run vr games and dcs if it means anything I guess
bug-reports 2022-02-22 18:35:39 Just motorlock
bug-reports 2022-07-14 15:48:49 is it normal that whenever your plane blows up your game crashes?
bug-reports 2022-07-14 16:34:36 I mean it usually happens with me even without piston lock
bug-reports 2022-07-14 16:34:47 it'll normally just of course kinda falling into pieces
bug-reports 2022-07-14 16:34:50 then my game just locks up
bug-reports 2022-07-14 16:36:02 The weird thing is I've actually tried it on two different computers and it still happens even if i'm getting a solid framerate
bug-reports 2022-07-14 16:36:44 Could be something on my end tho but I'm not sure what it is
bug-reports 2022-07-14 16:36:57 honestly thats not impossible loll
