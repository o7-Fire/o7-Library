creations-chat 2021-02-12 15:57:40 What do you guys think of my Mig 21?
creations-chat 2021-02-12 15:59:54 heres the motor locking for it aswell
creations-chat 2021-02-12 16:02:16 Thanks I made it without a reference image so thats why its wierd like that, ill change it
creations-chat 2021-02-12 16:12:05 Alright take 2 at the Mig 21
creations-chat 2021-02-12 16:14:21 It was alot harder to do the back because of the way I did the moterlock
creations-chat 2021-02-12 16:30:28 I tweaked the back a little, not sure if its any good because the motor 2s are visible but I cant get them to go inside without glitching everything out
creations-chat 2021-02-12 16:35:33 The bulge is there it just isnt made very well, ill tweak them both then
creations-chat 2021-02-12 16:56:33 Mig 21 The fuselage bulge is there just not that good from this angle, Th short nose isnt good from this angle
creations-chat 2021-02-12 17:03:29 Yes I did try
creations-chat 2021-02-12 17:07:39 Ok ill keep that in mind
creations-chat 2021-02-12 17:23:09 Im not sure if I should stop posting pictures of the mig being tweaked but i wanna see what you guys think
bot-central 2021-02-12 17:26:54 !rank
creations-chat 2021-02-12 17:29:50 This is the motorlocking of the Mig 21 noiw
creations-chat 2021-02-12 17:32:33 The motor locks were there from the beginning and I dont want to remove them as they have engine on them that stabilize the plane while flying
creations-chat 2021-02-12 17:42:37 Im not sure what much I can do with the canopy so here it is
creations-chat 2021-02-12 17:48:19 Odd switch but is my Do-17 any good?
creations-chat 2021-02-12 17:50:35 Here is this any good? I based it completely off of the war thunder earliest Do-17 varient Thats why the nose is like that

creations-chat 2021-02-13 18:48:21 What is this supposed to be btw?
creations-chat 2021-02-13 19:01:09 Should I put massive wings on this? Sort of in a steam punk type way
creations-chat 2021-02-13 19:10:35 Makes sense
creations-chat 2021-02-14 11:15:44 Is my harrier any good so far?
creations-chat 2021-02-14 11:18:58 The motor lock are disconnectors there's only 2 little bumps once the disconnectors fall off

creations-chat 2021-02-14 13:50:10 Its more or less finished I just need to paint it and tweak the air intakes a bit and its done
creations-chat 2021-02-14 13:58:08 Could you elaborate on Ew So I know what to change?
creations-chat 2021-02-14 14:00:19 So it looks nothing like a harrier?
creations-chat 2021-02-14 14:03:35 Is it too long or is it to do with the air intakes or the landing gear or something?
creations-chat 2021-02-14 14:06:00 Im pretty sure I got it the right length but yeah I agree the air intakes suck also Ill figure out how to fix the cockpit
creations-chat 2021-02-14 14:35:22 Is the paint ugly?
creations-chat 2021-02-14 14:38:00 Ill try a gradient but is this ok?
creations-chat 2021-02-14 14:41:10 I see why the gradient is better. Wrong picture lol wait 2 mins
creations-chat 2021-02-14 14:43:13 Alright here it is
creations-chat 2021-02-14 15:08:22 Ok thanks
creations-chat 2021-02-14 15:11:17 Not a good picture but would thrust vectoring look a bit like this?
creations-chat 2021-02-14 15:13:17 Thats the thing, I cant really do that without making it look even worse than it is but Ill still try
creations-chat 2021-02-14 15:17:32 I didnt know how to make the landing gears fit under the wing and there is already the other landing gear
creations-chat 2021-02-14 15:25:00 Ok I got the vectoring to work but it always gets stuck
creations-chat 2021-02-14 15:27:02 So like this?

creations-chat 2021-11-07 18:05:39 Yeah, visual effect are cool but they kinda hide the plane a bit. It was also kinda ruine dbecause you didnt turn on cinematic mode so we could see stuff in the bottom right, if you want a cinematic shot you should try to just include the building int the picture
creations-chat 2021-11-10 19:38:18 Any tips for my apache so far? I want to make sure it looks okay before I try building the nose
creations-chat 2021-11-10 19:42:50 Im too stupid to start on the nose, I found the nose really hard to build for some reason.
Should I remove the excess stuff i added to the tail then? the pictures I used didnt show off the angles lol
creations-chat 2021-11-10 19:46:30 Id be proud of it tbh lol, although I wouldnt personally post it lol
creations-chat 2021-11-10 19:50:59 First time someone has referred to an older plane and then changed their mind, monumental moment in my lifetime in plane crazy lol
creations-chat 2021-11-10 19:57:57 I want to see if its easier to build the nose from behind than from the front, I really struggle with helicopter noses
