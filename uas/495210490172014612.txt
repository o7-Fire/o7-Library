creations-chat 2021-01-21 16:34:19 how my B-17 front looks,ill add the turret and the glass soon(bottom part will be removed for the turret)
creations-chat 2021-01-22 00:52:23 feels abit weird but idk how to say
maybe too chonky?
creations-chat 2021-01-22 00:54:37 ight ive made 1 before lemme try make it out again
creations-chat 2021-01-22 00:57:06 wait imma check the blueprint and see the shape
creations-chat 2021-01-22 01:00:35 no i mean im finding one with 2D cut surface
https://tse3.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.BxKl-EABak4FS2FcfB4dUQHaKi&pid=15.1
something like this
creations-chat 2021-01-22 01:04:12 first dont use half ball for the front
and the front nose white part looks real weird with it
prefer bigger angle more than 2 diff angle
creations-chat 2021-01-22 01:08:03 is the white part under the window connected?
if not then remove it and make the nose into wadges that have same angle like half wadge up and wadge 1x2 or something
creations-chat 2021-01-22 01:11:07 if you gonna try to make realistic angle it will be a much more harder task(maybe)
you'll need motorlock and motor2 to adjust angle or use something even more harder to use like cam lock
since the only part i feel weird is the upper part of the nose
creations-chat 2021-01-22 01:13:13 ah suddenly remember a way to make it less weird
nvm
creations-chat 2021-01-22 01:15:29 Wait F
my blueprint and your blueprint isnt the same thing wth ive found it says its C130 but its not at all
but adjust the angle of the window its too slope
feels like slope of wedge 1x1
creations-chat 2021-01-22 01:19:56 better use motor lock for more detail and use motor 2 to adjust angle to 45 or around this
same way you did but diff angle
so what the hecc i found its not a C130 at all
creations-chat 2021-01-22 01:28:06 e sorry always misspell this
creations-chat 2021-01-22 01:31:57 f i finally know what is this
its a freaking C-47 then he write its C-130

creations-chat 2021-01-27 05:24:15 do you guys think its better tho,if yes then both wings will do it
creations-chat 2021-01-27 05:30:55 it affect the handling alot imma motor lock those half blocks on the wings
creations-chat 2021-01-27 06:15:27 always,i can feel that(sees my Ho-229)
meanwhile some of them cant even use motor lock
creations-chat 2021-01-27 06:30:55 i almost hide anything under the wings and the engine+fuselage making it looks bad

creations-chat 2021-01-27 09:09:25 i see now finally its a kinda hard task to do ,didnt realize that(i didnt see the inner part of engine oof)

creations-chat 2021-01-27 09:22:04 make motor lockx20 to make the trails into a cylinder <:thoink:657279634563399720>
creations-chat 2021-01-27 09:36:40 thats the problem,it also brings the wing panel aka the custom control surface into the fuselage
creations-chat 2021-01-27 09:40:45 the problem is the motor lock lock both pitch and tilt wing panels together
creations-chat 2021-01-27 09:43:14 something like this so i can use less motor lock to make 2 custom control surface,so motor lock it must bring the inner control surface into the plane

help 2021-02-06 11:23:38 like how many wing panels you out on the bottom part put same amount on the top part
help 2021-02-06 11:23:44 i think he mean like this

help 2021-02-06 11:30:24 what happen after remove the flaps?or turn off the flaps
help 2021-02-06 11:31:25 then you can only keep the flaps
help 2021-02-06 11:31:42 or else it will always be unstable
help 2021-02-06 11:31:57 im using my plane skill to help lol
help 2021-02-06 11:32:09 try hiding those somewhere
help 2021-02-06 11:32:25 like somewhere you put half blocks
help 2021-02-06 11:32:43 wait lemme show you
help 2021-02-06 11:33:29 like this
help 2021-02-06 11:33:46 the half blocks can connect to wing panels
help 2021-02-06 11:34:10 you can hide the wing panels like this
help 2021-02-06 11:34:18 might help stable it
help 2021-02-06 11:35:19 since i always do something like this when my plane cent of lift and cent of weight too far alway
help 2021-02-06 11:37:07 your rocket should be able to hide real alot of wing panels
creations-chat 2021-02-06 11:38:34 now the problem is how i build the hull god i hate this
help 2021-02-06 11:42:57 this will work
help 2021-02-06 11:43:05 i think
help 2021-02-06 11:43:15 as my missile works too
creations-chat 2021-02-06 11:45:24 why am i still making Leopard 2A7,just to suffer.
help 2021-02-06 11:48:03 yes using half blocks to connect as many wing panel as possible
help 2021-02-06 11:48:26 only 1 half blocks can already do that
help 2021-02-06 11:49:32 like hide those like this
creations-chat 2021-02-06 11:53:13 what.
the angle of the wadge 1x2 or the angle of the motor lock part
creations-chat 2021-02-06 11:55:38 if the motor lock part then that means they need to add a half block wadge down
help 2021-02-06 11:56:42 oh
help 2021-02-06 11:57:04 show it then
help 2021-02-06 11:57:27 hmm
help 2021-02-06 11:58:07 oh stall
help 2021-02-06 11:58:43 sometimes happen when speed is too low for its speed and the back is more close to the ground
help 2021-02-06 11:59:21 so if you add only a little more speed or pull your front down a bit more it wont happen
help 2021-02-06 11:59:33 no dont really need too fast
help 2021-02-06 11:59:51 a little bit slower to keep it flies
help 2021-02-06 12:00:00 umm
help 2021-02-06 12:00:33 speed up with only 1 click
help 2021-02-06 12:00:40 oh
help 2021-02-06 12:01:03 speed up only like a real small amount
help 2021-02-06 12:03:29 1 click
help 2021-02-06 12:03:44 see how many speed boosted up
help 2021-02-06 12:04:03 if not enough speed up with a small click only
help 2021-02-06 12:05:42 what you use to speed up?
help 2021-02-06 12:05:49 which button"
help 2021-02-06 12:06:55 ok so if you see it start going backwards press w
help 2021-02-06 12:07:07 few times untill it stop going backwards
help 2021-02-06 12:07:26 dont hold btw
help 2021-02-06 12:07:50 you mean its on and off only?
help 2021-02-06 12:08:51 you mean the speed is too slow to gain speed back when you start to fall back?
help 2021-02-06 12:10:42 welp that's a bit hard
help 2021-02-06 12:11:12 I dont design rocket which land so i need some test
help 2021-02-06 12:11:37 rocket which lands=missiles
help 2021-02-06 12:13:13 that's hard lemme think
help 2021-02-06 12:13:47 try make the center of lift as close as the center of weight
help 2021-02-06 12:14:09 by removing wing panels
help 2021-02-06 12:14:26 blue thing
help 2021-02-06 12:15:11 it falls back because the front lift too high or weight to heavy on the back
help 2021-02-06 12:15:45 remove some wing panels
help 2021-02-06 12:15:57 or add ballistic
help 2021-02-06 12:16:34 if the back too heavy add on the front and adjust by flying
help 2021-02-06 12:16:52 adjust weight"
help 2021-02-06 12:17:53 wait is the yellow thing on the mid point of the whole rocket ?
help 2021-02-06 12:19:06 yes
help 2021-02-06 12:19:08 hmm
help 2021-02-06 12:19:23 add boosts to slow it down.
help 2021-02-06 12:19:28 my final way
help 2021-02-06 12:20:04 on and off mode only rockets with different controls of the main driving rockets
help 2021-02-06 12:20:22 like shift to turn on to slow it down
help 2021-02-06 12:21:02 I mean the rocket you used to fly
help 2021-02-06 12:21:08 hmm
help 2021-02-06 12:21:32 use some buttons you can use which dont affect other things
help 2021-02-06 12:21:58 that works also
help 2021-02-06 12:22:24 since you only need to turn those on when you land
help 2021-02-06 12:23:12 you can try I think
help 2021-02-06 12:24:20 umm not now I have something to do right now

help 2021-02-08 02:31:37 yea
help 2021-02-08 02:31:45 i wanna see how so i can use that
help 2021-02-08 02:32:09 i didnt decide it moves also i just wanna let it be a model
help 2021-02-08 02:33:51 use motor to rotate and motor lock it?
help 2021-02-08 02:35:05 ok its not that hard then
help 2021-02-08 02:35:14 the turret is even harder than that
help 2021-02-08 02:43:54 wait nvm those are easier to build for open treads my tread guards doesnt allow me
help 2021-02-08 02:45:48 it dont have that much space for the treads motor lock
help 2021-02-08 02:49:59 totally
help 2021-02-08 02:59:15 does it looks good tho
help 2021-02-08 03:00:52 it cant move btw
help 2021-02-08 03:11:39 what.
help 2021-02-08 03:11:56 you sure?
help 2021-02-08 03:23:48 f i dont wanna rebuild it
help 2021-02-08 03:23:59 its a Leopard 2A7
help 2021-02-08 03:24:51 f i gonna remake the whole freaking back part kill me
help 2021-02-08 03:25:54 i did at first
help 2021-02-08 03:26:06 i didnt expect the engine is too long
help 2021-02-08 03:26:51 lemme take a rest its painful
help 2021-02-08 03:32:39 e
help 2021-02-08 03:32:53 youre skillful im not
help 2021-02-08 03:33:10 the Leo is totally not my level of building skill
help 2021-02-08 03:33:54 oh.
help 2021-02-08 03:38:43 wait i wanna ask what is this
help 2021-02-08 03:39:20 oh looks good
help 2021-02-08 03:40:19 hmm
help 2021-02-08 03:40:48 so you gonna use motor lock to make that shape
help 2021-02-08 03:41:28 although i think the shape can be made by wadges
help 2021-02-08 03:41:37 lots of them
help 2021-02-08 03:42:10 a
help 2021-02-08 04:54:30 actually my brain kinda hurts now
help 2021-02-08 04:54:35 i need some time to think
help 2021-02-08 04:55:04 i still need to remake the back of the leo later so lemme think
help 2021-02-08 04:55:28 your thing lose control
help 2021-02-08 04:56:35 oh
help 2021-02-08 04:57:21 then whole thing goes off?
help 2021-02-08 04:58:15 so if you undeploy at first it wont die?
help 2021-02-08 04:59:29 yes
help 2021-02-08 05:00:41 hmm
help 2021-02-08 05:07:06 hmm
help 2021-02-08 05:07:51 this thing happens just like now right
help 2021-02-08 05:09:01 attempt 7
help 2021-02-08 05:09:19 it happens as same as attempt 1 right
help 2021-02-08 05:09:43 hmm
help 2021-02-08 05:09:47 lemme see again
help 2021-02-08 05:10:45 your front flaps didnt deploy
help 2021-02-08 05:11:16 but if it dont as same as the back the whole thing will just die
help 2021-02-08 05:13:16 since the lift of the front and the back become different if you only deploy back one
help 2021-02-08 05:53:20 you deploy too much
help 2021-02-08 05:53:37 i think
help 2021-02-08 07:19:06 oh
help 2021-02-08 07:19:17 so how it lands now
help 2021-02-08 07:19:42 ah ok
help 2021-02-08 07:20:22 ah ok
help 2021-02-08 07:20:36 hmm
help 2021-02-08 08:28:45 i can almost sure the COL and the COW of it is totally messed up
help 2021-02-08 08:28:56 wait lemme check
help 2021-02-08 08:29:46 deploy the front flaps at the same time
help 2021-02-08 08:31:23 oh lemme think
help 2021-02-08 08:31:48 since the physics of this game is totally messed up
help 2021-02-08 08:32:09 you need something to prevent it rolls
help 2021-02-08 08:33:13 hmm
help 2021-02-08 08:34:04 you need wing panels which more far away from COW
help 2021-02-08 08:34:26 but it will looks weird
help 2021-02-08 08:35:15 all you can do is just deploy the flaps at 45 degree only i think
help 2021-02-08 08:41:29 hmmm
help 2021-02-08 08:43:48 they will
help 2021-02-08 08:43:51 somedays

help 2021-02-08 09:43:41 so it can land

help 2021-02-08 15:59:41 it's good but you need to train your landing skill more I think
help 2021-02-08 15:59:54 its possible to land like that

”not preference work”
can you have some logic

creations-chat 2021-12-05 14:50:15 unsmooth bow,and why theres tons of weird half wadges on deck its not decoration at all,building a tower on a ship isnt a bridge

events-chat 2022-01-30 16:48:43 rocket sucks only good when spamming tons of them on a plane
it sometimes even miss itself with auto tracking
events-chat 2022-01-30 16:49:21 and gun would need tons of time even just to shoot the wings off
events-chat 2022-01-30 16:50:33 seems like its a moment when prop plane and guns only moment
events-chat 2022-01-30 16:51:04 rocket velocity would be too bad and easy to dodge since low speed can do maneuver better
events-chat 2022-01-30 17:29:34 sounds like a skill issue
creations-chat 2022-01-31 06:45:08 actually rework the wings,everything else is pretty much fine <@595188515084566529>

creations-chat 2022-02-03 21:11:10 well lemme give my pov for the build:
it sucks,it looks nothing like the counterpart when i look at references picture,its way too blocky,totally lack of details,some shots arent even neccessary
and yes,everyone have their own pov,you like it you take it,you hate it then shut the fuck up and ignore,and meanwhile why you care about someone's opinion on others build?you get criticized then cope about it,this is PCC after all
creations-chat 2022-02-03 21:13:36 about someone who doesn't like someone's build and the other guy who doesn't own the build start the argument and say why he criticize the build

events-chat 2022-02-04 11:40:24 why the heck setting speed limit to 350 when rocket cant break 300
events-chat 2022-02-04 11:43:57 but rocket cant even break 300
events-chat 2022-02-04 11:44:21 or i should say barely so how those ppl go 347 sps with rockets
events-chat 2022-02-04 16:56:30 i did make a Yak 15 like fw 190

events-chat 2022-02-04 18:24:10 299 sps turn and 300 sps max speed <:trollface:775024642104229898>

events-chat 2022-02-04 18:24:56 it will only barely goes over 300 sps for a bit
events-chat 2022-02-04 18:33:00 actually rocket speed cap is at 300 how are we suppose to reach 350 with rocket only
events-chat 2022-02-04 18:35:35 h and i spam tons of them and still doesn't break over 310

events-chat 2022-02-06 18:33:00 oh yes i use wasd only for pvp plane as i cant use mouse to control somehow
unless war thunder like control
events-chat 2022-02-06 18:38:46 if you wondering can i actually get kills with wasd is yes,most of them are ground and also quite alot air
events-chat 2022-02-06 18:42:22 but rockets unguided so would be easier
events-chat 2022-02-06 18:43:03 gun
events-chat 2022-02-06 18:43:56 its at lower speed also so it would be easier for me to aim
events-chat 2022-02-06 18:44:16 my main weapon isnt rocket also
events-chat 2022-02-07 15:57:59 what if this
events-chat 2022-02-07 15:58:20 ramming on enemy <:trollface:775024642104229898>
events-chat 2022-02-08 17:44:59 block 1x0.9
events-chat 2022-02-08 17:45:15 then TNT and disconnector
events-chat 2022-02-08 17:45:32 what the hell
events-chat 2022-02-08 17:47:15 can i mod the bomber and make it smth like Bv 238<:trollface:775024642104229898>
events-chat 2022-02-08 17:48:55 i wont land on water tho lo
events-chat 2022-02-08 17:49:24 just extremely close to water and dropping trops at AA dead angle <:trollface:775024642104229898>
events-chat 2022-02-08 17:50:07 if i can mod it into Bv then i would do yousuf
events-chat 2022-02-08 17:50:50 would be interesting when i fly extremely low and approaching at AA dead angle<:trollface:775024642104229898>
events-chat 2022-02-08 17:51:30 yes you can thats why i wanna make it a big trop bomber but looks like Bv 239
events-chat 2022-02-08 17:52:49 theres literally no planes cant turn in my eyes in plane crazy 
almost,not every
events-chat 2022-02-08 17:53:12 i still remember i tried to make a new F104 then it never turns
events-chat 2022-02-08 17:53:28 roll then pitch who use yaw<:trollface:775024642104229898>
events-chat 2022-02-08 17:54:05 imagine yaw when you have insane roll rate<:LULW:719972409947717727>
creations-chat 2022-02-08 17:57:47 wow hars upvote approved HOF now
events-chat 2022-02-08 18:02:06 atleast torpedo can approach enemy itself which requires much less aim
events-chat 2022-02-08 18:03:02 but much more unfriendly for high altitude bombing tho since tropedo hard to do the job when its angle too big when landing on water
events-chat 2022-02-08 18:03:36 so basically much more dangerous to drop but much easier to get the job done
events-chat 2022-02-08 18:04:18 so thats why i wanna make the bomber a Bv238 and flying at extreme low alt and spam torps<:trollface:775024642104229898>
events-chat 2022-02-08 18:05:46 or what if im allowed to make OBC a swordfish<:thchoink:527880803456122891>

events-chat 2022-02-11 16:41:44 this might actual happen in the event
events-chat 2022-02-11 16:46:16 then can you ensure you can take care all of them before they drop?
events-chat 2022-02-11 16:47:14 imagine saying bomb useless <:KEKW:670310537300672528>

creations-chat 2022-02-13 16:09:23 this guy criticizing others build while his build so bad that even hars would say "delete it" instead of telling what to fix
creations-chat 2022-02-13 16:11:35 totally cant say knock off,he dont got the building skills

creations-chat 2022-02-13 16:15:18 said by a guy who only post 1 shitty sea vixen in <#384025409945337856>
creations-chat 2022-02-13 16:19:46 you know before you criticize you need to have the level to do the same thing,or better
simply say,you got some big differences in skill
creations-chat 2022-02-13 16:21:47 this white name telling me to shut up<:KEKW:670310537300672528>

creations-chat 2022-02-13 16:27:59 is he even trying to fight back,i totally cant feel it from his words
creations-chat 2022-02-13 16:30:00 he starting to look like he cant fight back anymore so he can only saying he's hating
now he even give up on hating
creations-chat 2022-02-13 16:32:05 but you fight back when people saying your build bad and start criticizing others build
smh just face what you've done
creations-chat 2022-02-13 16:35:41 ok keep yourself in the joy of that 11 upvotes,you never get better if you dont cope with those feedback and improve
creations-chat 2022-02-13 16:38:19 its like the frog in the well,seeing 11 upvote then think its good enough,while the world sees its far from enough
help 2022-02-13 16:39:09 worse than my 1 years old F-4
creations-chat 2022-02-13 16:42:05 this argument is pretty peaceful,ive seen worse
<@504577008383033344> exactly,worse would be tsar,still not worst
creations-chat 2022-02-13 17:21:04 pretty much too short,intakes to exhaust shape isnt correct
creations-chat 2022-02-13 17:33:06 <@752908414371233793> isnt that draft a bit too much
creations-chat 2022-02-13 17:35:33 that means how deep your boat goes for floating smth idk how to explain better
simply say why your boat go so deep it almost reaches the lower bridge
creations-chat 2022-02-13 17:39:41 the catapult part is kinda weird its so wide but its not even possible to put any planes there, and also some part on flight deck is kinda too plain,and itself being too bright in color
yeah if you actually fix those its actually a pretty good carrier
creations-chat 2022-02-13 17:45:28 also fix these
make that part more slim and make the landing runway line up with that part i circled
creations-chat 2022-02-13 17:50:31 smh lemme try find the photo out again explaining how a carrier hull should be
creations-chat 2022-02-13 17:53:03 a normal carrier hull doesn't shape like that it should be like a normal ship hull with big flat plate on,try imagine with that(i cant find the pic for explaining 💀)
creations-chat 2022-02-13 17:55:59 yeah i cant found that explanation picture but this also works <@752908414371233793>
creations-chat 2022-02-13 17:57:59 good,but you need to fill the pilot with it to make it better
he
creations-chat 2022-02-14 04:00:56 why so many exposed lock meanwhile you have that many space to hide the lock
creations-chat 2022-02-14 04:03:20 you have,look at your fuselage
smh theres alot of space for hiding motor lock just you didnt try to find it
creations-chat 2022-02-14 04:05:25 simply skill issue as you have that many space for hiding locks in fuselage and you still make 2 branch of lock tower to side
creations-chat 2022-02-14 04:08:14 you are the idiot,why you side lock the thing which could be putted at the main fuselage
creations-chat 2022-02-14 04:10:30 you still dont have to make a side lock for just to angle spine idiot
if you cant that means your fucking motorlock tower is putted at totally wrong location
creations-chat 2022-02-14 04:12:55 no spamming <:KEKW:670310537300672528>
creations-chat 2022-02-14 04:15:27 simply skill issue for needing huge space just to do 1 slight angle lock
creations-chat 2022-02-14 04:18:18 90% space wasted which could be compressed to use less lock
creations-chat 2022-02-14 04:21:07 simply skill issue
using less lock than you and still did better than yours which is full of exposed lock
creations-chat 2022-02-14 04:23:34 then learn how smh
creations-chat 2022-02-14 04:59:44 trust me,motor lock isnt hard

creations-chat 2022-09-16 04:54:33 ik i didnt try to cobruh tho
Mr who tells me to do to make it doing funny maneuver in 0 airspeed
btw nam jets cringe,cant even go over 1000 without conveyor engine
creations-chat 2022-09-16 05:02:03 obviously first their skill sucks alot,and nam jets obviously sucks at turning, going just 200 sps when turn
creations-chat 2022-09-16 05:05:53 nam also taught the wrong way to fix wobble which is wobble happens is because of nose lift too high or back lacks tons of lift,then he only taught to remove wing on front or remove weight on the back
which is wrong,and he said going even lighter is fucking bullshit, more important thing is reducing drags,even your plane weight like a mid age fat man
yeah anyway overall nam nam sucks in building pvp planes
creations-chat 2022-09-16 05:08:42 well using trapdoors to replace wings does helps reducing drags,actually can do
creations-chat 2022-09-16 05:10:45 add some wing panels on the back, your tail lack of lift
<@389516889501728779>  oh yeah why i reduce drag on main wing is just because i can spam more wings in the plane, so it can turn sharp even weight like a mid age fat American
creations-chat 2022-09-16 05:24:40 i wanna try lo my new PvP jet still need some fighting experimenting

<@291284163762323457> yet 3 planes is cheaper than them
creations-chat 2022-10-03 04:19:29 F-35 just Harrier but with a little more powerful engine and shitty stealth admit it
imagine bombing with F-35 and meanwhile losing stealth capability but not using F-16
F-16 even loads more
creations-chat 2022-10-03 04:21:48 its,if they update it make it capable to mount newer missile,accept the fact
creations-chat 2022-10-03 04:24:00 imagine using expensive aircraft doing the same thing but worse<:clueless:942802644043464734> 
<@706717603258957864> if you need to mount as much bomb as F-16 then F-35 have to do external mount,which make stealth useless 
idiot
creations-chat 2022-10-03 04:26:15 it does idiot its capable for external bomb mount,and im talking about if you going to mount as much bomb as F-16
creations-chat 2022-10-03 04:28:45 then why dont just use F-16,the enemy they fighting doesn't require stealth also
creations-chat 2022-10-03 04:30:47 they still survive,not important if the plane destroyed coz not expensive 
the equipment isnt all in war idiot,look at ww2 germans when theres no aces
the pilot is more important than expensive plane
creations-chat 2022-10-03 04:33:26 then do you think you really need to use a high maintenance cost jet doing same stuff F-16 does in Iraq or somewhere in middle east?the problem isnt the mission successful or not its about the cost
creations-chat 2022-10-03 04:35:39 doesn't fucking work
yet Americans still upgrading it
totally not fucking working my man
stop thinking about newer is better they only increase cost
<@456226577798135808> and 0 profit after war gg why fighting that war then
creations-chat 2022-10-03 04:38:50 F-16 upgrade isnt just changing tire idiot its like upgrading a JDM car with better stuff,which makes it preforms better and yet still capable of going against newer opponent or mission

creations-chat 2023-05-04 19:32:03 theres a reason why some people ended up in playing pvp yet its still glitchy and ez to break
creations-chat 2023-05-04 19:34:06 yes its stupid roblox consistently breaking every single game and think they improved their game
like recently motor 2 broke like for the 6th time i know
also i just start spamming downvotes on every suckass build or imperfect build in creations now<:clueless:942802644043464734>
creations-chat 2023-05-04 19:36:36 and another reason of not getting fixed is because roblox is stupid that caused source code glitch and create unfixable glitch, just like the motor 2
