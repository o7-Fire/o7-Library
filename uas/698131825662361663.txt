creations-chat 2021-01-23 05:44:41 it was kinda easy. I had to put 2 on one track, and the other 2 on the other track. So easy-ish and hard-ish.
creations-chat 2021-01-23 05:46:58 i had to motor lock this one into place, because of the locomotive's motor lock was in the way.
creations-chat 2021-02-12 04:51:38 give me the wheels, i will dry clean them.

creations-chat 2021-03-06 01:26:30 <@!702234928666116127> (sorry for ping) but i like your train, you did a great job.
creations-chat 2021-03-06 01:32:18 looks good
creations-chat 2021-03-06 04:00:38 you need to build better (no-offense) its just the shape, i know you tried your best.
creations-chat 2021-03-06 04:03:36 yes i get its hard making round noses for trains, especially if you dont have any skill, but its kind of easier with locked motor, but yet difficult.
creations-chat 2021-03-06 04:52:24 idk what it is, but looks cool
creations-chat 2021-03-07 11:24:56 how does this look for a jet?
creations-chat 2021-03-07 11:29:11 its either an custom/modified jet or a MIG-32. I dont really know..
Because i dont really know is that i am thinking about it.
creations-chat 2021-03-07 11:42:22 ok
creations-chat 2021-03-07 11:56:53 ik its terrifying, but i dont make jets often.
creations-chat 2021-03-07 21:19:02 t r a n e
creations-chat 2021-03-09 07:23:34 is there anything i need to fix? It has custom landing gear, so its the first time using it.
creations-chat 2021-03-09 07:25:35 ik, i dont know which colour is right.
creations-chat 2021-03-09 07:27:42 a darkish green, a bit on the light side
creations-chat 2021-03-30 05:41:56 im gonna need to make this smaller because i only have like a small area to build this, and this is very big which sucks, i didn't plan this out
creations-chat 2021-03-30 11:07:24 theres literally six blocks from the pipe to the top of the build limit, how can i fold that?
creations-chat 2021-03-30 21:23:34 im just stupid on how to fold because i never make ships this big, i usually try to make them fit in my plot, but i forgot all about that, this is my first ship i built this year. Ok
creations-chat 2021-03-30 21:27:47 here you go. The pipe itself is 18 blocks high i think, but i think making it smaller would be better.
creations-chat 2021-03-30 21:31:17 but, the bridge? Should i just use pistons to push it up? The body of my ship is 17 blocks tall.
creations-chat 2021-03-31 02:05:22 i am big noob tho :(
creations-chat 2021-03-31 02:07:51 im ok at motorlock
creations-chat 2021-04-02 14:09:05 Don't ask me why its so big, but give feedback on what i should improve.
creations-chat 2021-09-23 18:39:39 <@456226577798135808> dude, that is sick. I made one but of my own. my roblox cant even handle it how big it is, the fact it crashes each time i try to fold it
