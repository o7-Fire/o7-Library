creations-chat 2021-03-10 02:42:43 i might change the cockpit mechanism as it isn't very compact
creations-chat 2021-03-10 02:49:48 it currently uses a motor 2 (circled in red) to pull the suspension (blue) so it looks like it hinges off the back corner [help with this be much appreciated]
creations-chat 2021-03-10 02:56:04 <@!333570869114830859> this a better shape?

help 2021-03-10 04:20:00 ok thx
creations-chat 2021-03-10 04:34:42 bc its how people work, trains in plane crazy dont work very well and they look weird when they do (also its a reasonably new feature so it's not perfected yet)
creations-chat 2021-03-10 04:38:11 i agree but you add/subtract the difference between form and function and ususlly its not as functional as it looks
