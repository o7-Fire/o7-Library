creations-chat 2022-07-24 04:15:12 wsg
creations-chat 2022-07-24 04:17:16 quite nice, thank you. I did some watersports on my lake. yours?
creations-chat 2022-07-24 04:19:28 Kneeboarding, waterskiing, tubing and jet skiing
creations-chat 2022-08-07 05:01:27 STOL apparently it‚Äôs a thing. I‚Äôve seen people put canards on an F-15 before
creations-chat 2022-08-07 05:04:47 There‚Äôs 2 the other one is gray and it‚Äôs a bad camera angle
creations-chat 2022-08-07 05:07:09 Agreed. I hate seeing canards on planes that don‚Äôt need them, same with propellers instead of controlled tails.
creations-chat 2022-08-07 05:10:09 Motor 2 tails will do the trick just fine, and will look much better.
creations-chat 2022-08-07 05:13:11 That may be true, but with a glitch mouse plane built right you can have a pretty low stall speed
creations-chat 2022-08-07 05:17:04 If the plane is built with the right center of mass, and functioning ailerons, propellers are overkill. And instead of using canards you can alternatively hide control surfaces in the nose of the plane.
creations-chat 2022-08-07 05:20:10 Practice. Also if the actual plane has canards it‚Äôs a good idea to build canards üòÇ
creations-chat 2022-08-07 05:22:19 Dude all the angles are perfect nice work
creations-chat 2022-08-07 05:24:27 I don‚Äôt do much pvp but I know you can make a very well handling plane with only tails. I have an F-15 that can cobra without stalling just from tails
creations-chat 2022-08-07 05:26:29 I meant tails üò≠
creations-chat 2022-08-07 05:28:54 I‚Äôve adapted the plane to do much more than just a cobra. I don‚Äôt cobra that often in pvp it was just an example of the plane‚Äôs maneuverability. Definitely helpful for shaking off noobs in tut planes
help 2022-08-07 05:41:18 ?rhelp
help 2022-08-07 05:41:29 Ok I see
help 2022-08-07 05:43:17 Just read the rules apparently you just have to make a big plane
help 2022-08-07 05:43:22 Doesn‚Äôt even have to be good

creations-chat 2022-08-07 06:23:04 Show despawned
creations-chat 2022-08-07 06:38:01 Is this a scale build?
creations-chat 2022-08-07 06:40:08 Nose is a bit long imo. Don‚Äôt get me wrong it looks great, that‚Äôs just what I think
creations-chat 2022-08-07 06:42:12 Fair enough. Also you nailed that horizontal seam it has along the nose
creations-chat 2022-08-07 06:46:01 I‚Äôve made attempts on the F-35 but at the scale I‚Äôm trying it‚Äôs just to small for that seam, and wouldn‚Äôt fly well. Thought about using delta wings to give that effect but eventually settled on a cutter nose.
creations-chat 2022-08-07 06:48:32 There‚Äôs a proper way to scale and find the distance of one block compared to different parts of the plane I forgor the formula but if you want to make a scale build I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs useful
help 2022-08-07 07:06:03 Yeah I think it‚Äôs backwards
help 2022-08-07 07:06:29 Nah I‚Äôm not going too
help 2022-08-07 07:06:34 I have some grinding to do
creations-chat 2022-08-07 07:22:16 Because the people who can actually make decent builds (in pcc standards) are the smallest percentage of all pc players
creations-chat 2022-08-07 07:24:21 Not really, I‚Äôm trying to say that the bar is set so high in pcc, hopping in an average public server those builds would be good. It‚Äôs all about where the standards are
creations-chat 2022-08-07 07:26:36 Energy of pcc is odd, take it with a grain of salt.
creations-chat 2022-08-07 07:29:07 Very true. joining pcc was sobering, especially for a new builder. Especially since most good builds only function in private servers
creations-chat 2022-08-07 07:31:48 When my friend tells me to come check out his new jet
