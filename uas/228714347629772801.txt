creations-chat 2019-12-04 05:45:09 I'm not sure if this has been done before but I used motors to make a War Thunder style mouse aim plane https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVxlDuvrV-U&feature=youtu.be
creations-chat 2019-12-04 05:45:48 Works much better than the regular mouse aim + it's op as all heck
creations-chat 2019-12-04 05:46:03 Still working on making the roll mouse aim, for now it's manual
creations-chat 2019-12-04 05:54:59 Works good in third person just hold down right click
