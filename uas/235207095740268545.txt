plane-crazy 2020-04-13 06:44:31 step one) u win the challenge
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 06:44:00 i have a challenge for you guys
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 06:07:02 alright
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 06:06:43 no
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 06:05:39 no
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 05:47:03 epic roasted
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 05:46:58 you look blocky
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 05:46:19 I wanna put a bunch of trails on it so when I turn on the conveyor drives it looks epic
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 05:45:03 yeah super rockets
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 05:44:20 BRO WHAT IF I PUT THE CONVEYOR DRIVES ON THE MOTOR2'S
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 05:43:50 what about instant direction changes
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 05:40:46 idk if it's even possible to put all that into one aircraft
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 05:38:51 the perfect pvp plane in my opinion would have mouse-controlled guns and rockets, droppable bombs, lined with cutters, 500+ speed, instant direction changes, and able to function with half of it destroyed
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 05:33:20 I want to make the perfect pvp plane
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 05:32:30 how fast
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 05:31:56 so you'd need something really fast that can change directions easily
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 05:31:12 yeah but you could slice that up with a cutter plane
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 05:30:35 air to air, land, and water
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 05:30:01 what's the most effective pvp creation in plane crazy
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 05:02:40 unde?
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 05:01:23 its new top speed is 3000
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 05:01:06 then i put 4 conveyor engines on it
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 05:00:32 ...its top speed is 45...
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 05:00:13 it uses like 1500 super thrusters
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 04:59:37 i made a Borg cube
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 04:50:33 if they move they're just gonna get shredded to pieces
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 04:49:48 bro I've got an idea: cutter nets. u just fly over someone and drop a net of cutters connected by ropes onto their plane or tank or whatever
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 04:47:26 put cutters all over it and ram people
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 04:47:08 c u t t e r s
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 04:46:43 not at all
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 04:43:22 you're just minding your own business when something suddenly zooms past you and now your whole plane is cut in half
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 04:42:21 imagine conveyor engines on a plane lined with cutters
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 04:37:48 cutters are the best weapons, change my mind
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 04:05:43 I wanna make a cutter minigun
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 04:01:55 where the sole purpose of the plane is just ram into other planes and vehicles to cut them up
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 04:01:23 are there any cutter planes out there
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 04:00:30 <@216193164199985152> how
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 03:51:33 best performance wise
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 03:50:18 idk how im gonna do it but im gonna do it
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 03:49:21 it has to be very fast and able to near instantly change directions
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 03:48:27 tomorrow I'm gonna make the best pvp plane in the game
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 03:47:33 earlier somebody made this spinning hovercraft that flung a ton of ropes around  that had cutters along them and it was terrifying
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 03:39:08 but I'm not gonna tell you because it's such a good idea that people might steal it üò≥
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 03:38:38 omg this is such a good idea
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 03:38:20 wait I have an idea
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 03:37:38 bruh everyone out here making WASD turrets
