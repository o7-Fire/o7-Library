creations-chat 2019-01-07 00:37:01 <@!265546886260195329> In your video, you achieved a speed of 1,098,597,888 studs per second. According to a blog post from 2012, 1 meter is equal to 20 studs and 1,098,597,888 / 20 = 54,929,894 meters per second. The speed of light is 299,892,458 meters per second, so sadly you did not achieve lightspeed.
