the-dump 2021-12-12 21:23:07 OH NO-  ðŸ”¨ðŸ’¥
the-dump 2021-12-14 04:07:47 holy shit that sound effect gives me ptsd
the-dump 2021-12-14 04:47:38 Subspace tripmine, it's an invisible landmine that earrapes you when it goes off, also turns everything it hits pink. I remember it from Shedletsky's game "a bridge too far", a game where you blow up a cool bridge. You place one and forget it's there, then you accidentally touch it and it gives you a literal heart attack. Even worse when you're the only one in the server bc you don't expect it. But yeah, basically a surreal jumpscare landmine
the-dump 2021-12-16 16:01:48 Is this a turbo tas? Or is this a regular tas using new tech I haven't seen yet
creations-chat 2021-12-18 06:49:04 what the fuck are the upvote/downvote standards of this community
creations-chat 2021-12-18 06:52:02 generic battleship or tank for the 83487th time = 7987 upvotes 12 downvotes
neat unique plane = 14 upvotes 987 downvotes

historically and physically accurate recreation of a cool plane = 15 upvotes 200 downvotes
literally the same plane but uglier = 200 upvotes and 15 downvotes (they used motor lock to clip stuff together so it's automatically better)

creations-chat 2022-03-07 06:05:05 this server is the epitome of touch grass + shower + talk to women

yall are literally shitting on each other over roblox lmao please take social cues from other real people irl and learn to have civilized conversation
creations-chat 2022-03-07 06:08:50 wait what's wrong with antilgbt lol, they shame eachother into supporting eachother and it's a toxic endless feedback loop that causes people to negatively change themselves to conform to social pressures by submitting to the flow
creations-chat 2022-06-19 22:59:55 "Shit paintjob" THE PLANE IS LITERALLY JUST BLACK

contest-chat 2022-07-12 02:20:08 looks like it's gonna turn out sick tbh
events-chat 2022-07-17 19:58:07 AR2 doesn't run for more than 5 minutes without crashing
events-chat 2022-07-17 19:58:55 I have an RTX3050 and 32GB RAM on top of a 12th gen 12 core i5 and AR2 crashes like every time I do something
events-chat 2022-07-17 19:59:12 Like touching water just crashes me like half the time
events-chat 2022-07-17 19:59:59 It's insane that AR2 has been early access for what like 3 years? And it crashes. What other roblox game crashes, that literally just doesn't happen
events-chat 2022-07-17 20:00:18 Oh and the running animation is goofy af lol
events-chat 2022-07-17 20:01:33 To me it feels like there's some gross serverside memory leak or smth bc servers destabilize over time
events-chat 2022-07-17 20:03:34 burh
events-chat 2022-07-17 20:03:54 Incredibly disappointing because AR1 was kickass
events-chat 2022-07-17 20:04:10 Like it was just SO GOOD
Everything just worked
events-chat 2022-07-17 20:04:46 The world felt lived in and full, the guns felt great, PvP was balanced, good zombie density, etc
events-chat 2022-07-17 20:05:08 I saw AR2 and was like hooooly shit how can they make this better
events-chat 2022-07-17 20:05:24 I need to stop getting excited for things

Plane Crazy players try to build literally anything that's not a fighter jet challenge (impossible)
contest-chat 2022-09-06 19:01:12 this argument is stupid, if it's a plane designed to damage things it's an attack aircraft
contest-chat 2022-09-06 19:01:47 but that is literally what attack aircraft means
contest-chat 2022-09-06 19:01:50 attack
contest-chat 2022-09-06 19:01:52 aircraft
contest-chat 2022-09-06 19:02:02 a bomber is an attack aircraft lol
contest-chat 2022-09-06 19:02:21 yes
contest-chat 2022-09-06 19:02:25 literally yes lol
contest-chat 2022-09-06 19:02:39 but is it not an aircraft that attacks
contest-chat 2022-09-06 19:03:22 twas a novelty statement
contest-chat 2022-09-06 19:03:28 simply tomfoolery
contest-chat 2022-09-06 19:04:19 technically any aircraft can be an attack aircraft but only once
contest-chat 2022-09-06 19:05:34 but where's the lie
contest-chat 2022-09-06 19:06:22 kek
