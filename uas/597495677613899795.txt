creations-chat 2021-05-09 18:47:33 his is way different lmao
creations-chat 2021-05-09 18:49:34 all I did was look up Mig-29 on google and went off of that
creations-chat 2021-05-09 18:51:35 idk
creations-chat 2021-05-09 18:56:56 I am being honest lmao, Idk who that man is
creations-chat 2021-05-09 18:58:59 I literally made it last night, it took like 2 hours to make, angling and placing blocks is hard when you are trying to go off of a picture, anyways, I don't even know what his or hers looks like
creations-chat 2021-05-09 19:01:44 ah, then no, I dont think they look the same, alr
creations-chat 2021-05-09 19:05:20 imma have to dm them
creations-chat 2021-05-09 19:19:05 long
creations-chat 2021-05-09 19:50:19 I can still read your comments, stop trying to spread false rumors when I know what I used as a reference for my Mig
creations-chat 2021-05-09 19:52:21 based it off of this
creations-chat 2021-05-09 19:54:22 Idk that video, or that man/woman, just look at my history from last night, which was when I made it
creations-chat 2021-05-09 19:57:26 this is what I found when I searched up Mig 29
creations-chat 2021-05-09 19:59:40 lol yeah, I was comparing a build from my friend to the tutorial, just to make sure it was allowed into CDF, also nice name
creations-chat 2021-05-09 20:03:42 idk, the only compared part I see are the guns, but I use those on most my plane lol
creations-chat 2021-05-09 20:06:39 nope, I don't think so m8, I only used 250 blocks for mine, quite small nice tank WIP
creations-chat 2021-05-09 20:09:29 he has a point
creations-chat 2021-05-09 20:11:30 this man has a point, I've seen a lot of Mig-29s that were like mine, or whoever Destroyer is
creations-chat 2021-05-09 20:15:26 I'm looking through youtube for mig-29s and most of them look like this destroyer guy's
creations-chat 2021-05-09 20:18:54 it's ok, it happens, I feel your pain, nyways, those are some nice jets lol
creations-chat 2021-05-09 20:23:38 Imma submit the build that I made a couple months ago
creations-chat 2021-05-09 20:26:58 Alr, have a nice day, Imma be deciding what to do for the rest of the day
the-dump 2021-05-11 23:23:37 I'll be watching for any videos on me, Destroyer
the-dump 2021-05-11 23:25:16 never thought about that
creations-chat 2021-06-15 16:15:21 ah yes, very mixed thoughts on my mig
creations-chat 2021-06-15 16:19:42 I used them from my "copy" of destroyers mig, since they work well for pvp(you have a good point lol)
creations-chat 2021-06-15 16:42:52 I explained it on plane crazy, I dont have the "copied" mig anymore, and the videos were taken down, also sheeesh 23 downvoted
creations-chat 2021-06-15 16:45:50 yeah, I know that, and I dont have it, destroyer's friend destruction logic watched me delete the vid4eos, @ destructivelogic is who
creations-chat 2021-06-15 16:51:57 that is a good fighter jet, it might not be detailed, and a bit bland on the color side, but I mean, the design is pretty good, the size reminds me of a stealth jet
creations-chat 2021-06-15 17:15:39 hol up lemme compare the two lol
creations-chat 2021-06-15 17:18:05 yeah I see what you mean, I might want to fix that, I compared the two, they kinda look the same, anyways yeah I might want to fix it
creations-chat 2021-06-15 17:20:28 Im gonna save that picture, anyways yeah i will do that, I will try to do moldova
creations-chat 2021-06-15 17:23:37 lots of motorlock, looks good, lol, I did not mean it like that
creations-chat 2021-06-15 17:54:10 I tried to redo the back of my mig, and I dont think I am that smart lol, if I do a single thing, it breaks, so I might want to remake it into a su or something, idk
creations-chat 2021-06-15 17:58:14 also the coloring for it was supposed to be for a mikoyan mig, but yeah I should shade it better, since the mikoyan has a darker outside and a lighter inside
creations-chat 2021-06-15 18:03:59 nice
creations-chat 2021-06-15 21:36:09 I've already been told
creations-chat 2021-06-15 21:45:57 Alright, that's not the mig, it is a different one, click the spy glass somewhere on the screen then type in has file: oblivious panda
creations-chat 2021-06-15 21:48:01 This is the thing that people called copied
creations-chat 2021-06-15 22:01:29 N-no... my current one is bigger, and I was told that it looked like a su33
creations-chat 2021-06-17 14:58:35 <@747811503591129170> I was scrolling in the creations channel, and oh my God your mig is so good, even better then my mig-29
creations-chat 2021-07-02 12:29:09 nvm I see
creations-chat 2021-07-02 12:44:50 <@456226577798135808> ok, your helicopter is way better then any helicopter I can build, so congrats, plus that's your first helicopter, you are quite skilled tbh, the back angle is also quite good, I like the color scheme, though the only bad thing I see, is a bit of motorlock shown, but eh, it happens
creations-chat 2021-07-02 17:49:03 Never posted a tutorial. I have the thing despawned and I don't see a tutorial on it
creations-chat 2021-07-02 17:52:14 Cool Inspection time brb
creations-chat 2021-07-02 17:55:25 What, I don't see anything weird or off the spectrum besides me modding it way too much to the point where it barely resembles the main thing, mainly the system though, also I probably should have pointed out the fact that it was heavily modded, but eh i rarely post here, and I have 1 braincell
creations-chat 2021-07-02 17:57:48 I guess I actually deserve that punch, also I added, subtracted, fixed, and balanced, since I am the bored, the thing barely goes up or down and can barely roll due to the fact of its size that I had to put so many motorlocked rockets into it for that problem to be fixed, but hey its fast and one of my half custom pvp buildd
creations-chat 2021-07-02 18:07:49 I lost more then I made
creations-chat 2021-07-02 18:11:24 That will be your opinion, I think it is cute
creations-chat 2021-07-02 18:13:27 Waita minute, hol up gonna inspect this picture since creations blacklist nope I see what you mean, looks strange, since it is basically 16 bits for mc
creations-chat 2021-07-09 10:46:47 Napalm
creations-chat 2021-07-09 10:49:37 It is a role that blocks you from posting creations/seeing creations not block you from creations feedback
creations-chat 2021-11-04 03:16:36 I'm still blacklisted lmao
creations-chat 2021-11-04 13:32:53 Half downvote moment
creations-chat 2021-11-04 14:32:32 Lol 2 and 1 is what it is showing for mine
creations-chat 2021-11-04 14:38:25 Bet I'll post a blackshark
creations-chat 2021-11-04 14:41:08 I haven't copied ever since I pledged to both destroyer and gjsolo, all my builds are mine, I have gained a lot of skill from my friends, I now have more then 40 days into the game, cry about it genshin impact pfp
creations-chat 2021-11-04 14:43:09 Mans raging over a person who made a tank, an actually good one
creations-chat 2021-11-04 14:46:45 I'm in class, cant really argue, also, yeah ik I copied, yeah ik I made a tutorial but if I were to show you all my builds, there is nothing that is a tutorial besides a  B-29 that I wanna remake, at least I'm being blunt about the subject,  I'm not hiding the fact I copied, I just dtn want any conflict on the situation
creations-chat 2021-11-04 14:49:32 Not much detail momento (it's 9K115s)
creations-chat 2021-11-04 14:51:34 Firstly, 14*, secondly, not mad, I can care less, thirdly, I'm not a predator, at least add details
creations-chat 2021-11-04 14:57:20 Never said I was a walmart employee, the faction involved was donnie dodo, I ever blocked anyone, I am still in factions, jaim and some others were in on it, orange banned me because of me being epic hacker man, and also copin

It started over my tank
creations-chat 2021-11-04 15:01:02 Lmao, gonna paraphrase what he said into "imma dox you"
creations-chat 2021-11-04 15:04:12 Yeah, I can tell you this, the whole  "iwas a girl" thing was an experiment with a few people in on it, I dont work at walmart, I 14, and the tutorial was a mig-27 I think, I'm also in math class rn
creations-chat 2021-11-04 15:07:45 Alr, anyways, more info is that the group was CDF, I remember the group of idiots being called ROY, the man I dmed to remove my creations blacklist is also the man I told about tonk


There is also no difference between copying and inspiration if both look almost the same <@757655995051802654>
creations-chat 2021-11-04 16:44:31 The first tank looks like my friend's, the second one is good
creations-chat 2021-11-04 17:07:46 E, I'm not home rn, and I gotta ask him
creations-chat 2021-11-04 17:46:14 No I do, it is something air cant build, just it also kinda looks like mah friends
creations-chat 2021-11-23 06:52:01 debating if I want to post a photo of mine and my friend's jet without permission from them
creations-chat 2021-11-23 06:54:30 I mean, the thing is they are the exact same Weepin
creations-chat 2021-11-23 07:06:06 Guessing the guys name I'd Mario on discord? <@654510724269211648>
creations-chat 2021-11-23 07:12:18 Conflict assessed
creations-chat 2021-11-23 07:22:00 It's alright, mig 29 conflict is over, Mig-23 was my fault, and I'm friends with the man who made the video, he let me and another person copy it for a formation flight
bot-central 2021-11-24 07:51:24 !rank
creations-chat 2022-02-25 04:50:49 1 downvote😎 Also, sadly no I can't change the color since I'm not good with color schemes, most my builds will be black/grey unless it is supposed to be accurate to a real life counterpart
