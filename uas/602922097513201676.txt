help 2023-06-06 20:34:41 Plane Crazy Players who know how to motorlock and motorlock experts, I need help with my plane's horizontal stabilizer. Once I motorlock everything, it won't move. Please give me ideas on how to fix it. And yes, I've tried using control surfaces to make a small gap so it can move, still won't budge.
help 2023-06-06 20:38:24 no, its nigh enough so that the max angle ive set it (15) doesnt reach it
help 2023-06-06 20:39:33 wait, you may be right. ill check
help 2023-06-06 20:40:15 yup, it clips into it
help 2023-06-06 20:40:33 ima try adding a control surface to where it clips
help 2023-06-06 20:43:24 wait, its the bottom lock. i use 2 locks for the upper and lower verticle stabilizers
help 2023-06-06 20:43:54 ill try moving the lower one's lock a bit up because thats the lock that gets clipped
help 2023-06-06 20:44:26 i pray it works
help 2023-06-06 20:44:34 this has already taken 16 hours of my life
help 2023-06-06 20:49:16 These 2 are just out enough so that they can bug out the stabilizer
help 2023-06-06 20:49:44 if i change them with half blocks, the stabilizers is okay
help 2023-06-06 20:49:51 problem is
help 2023-06-06 20:50:49 if the upper one is fixed, there is the lower one. it is also out enough so that when i move the stabilizer (horizontal) down or for the aircraft to go up, it clips in it too
