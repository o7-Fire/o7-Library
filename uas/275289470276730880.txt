creations-chat 2018-11-16 15:06:15 It's meant to be short, to be a smaller target and a manoeverable plane

creations-chat 2018-11-20 14:55:48 The fastest and most manoeverable small fighter jet i made yet, it has 111 blocks, can go up to around 600 speed at max speed, and turns quite rapidly.

creations-chat 2018-11-20 15:19:17 thanks
creations-chat 2019-08-19 08:36:31 This is my fighter jet, it's inspired from real life Dassault Rafale and F-35B fighters, it can go up to 610 Speed (useful to evade other fighters), can do a 360Â° turn in 5 seconds, and capable of vertical landing and somewhat hovering (hovering is not very stable). It is very manoeverable. It is also small sized, which makes it hard to hit.
