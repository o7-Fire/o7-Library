help 2018-12-06 05:44:21 how do i get a wing design that i like on the center of mass because i've seen people do what they want with their center fo gravity but i cant do it with mine
creations-chat 2018-12-10 03:00:43 My take on a battleship. Its a foldable with two 4 barrel turrets (one of them do not have a gun) and one triple barrel turret. It's powered by super rockets and is capable of a top speed of 80 sps. 1931 blocks. You guys can tell me what class and ship it resembles!
