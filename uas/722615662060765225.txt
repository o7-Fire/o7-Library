help 2022-10-30 02:43:03 My mech looks so stupid when flying i need help
help 2022-10-30 02:44:06 Guys please my last question wasn't answered for a whole day and google cant even help
bug-reports 2022-10-30 02:52:25 Please for the love of god fix the bug where we cant place beams without any blocks beside it, 

theres also a bug that makes you stay in the pilot seat when disabling pilot mode, normally you should go back to the ground

I know this sounds like suggestion content but i cant access suggestions, please let mobile players have cursor (pc) based building where you could just tap an area and place the block, dont remove the crosshair tho

Also cutters cant be painted anymore?
