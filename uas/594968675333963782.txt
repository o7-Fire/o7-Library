creations-chat 2021-05-02 19:59:47 ugh.... I get that joke every time.

the-dump 2021-05-02 21:21:14 ok? I can't draw so I resort to using the piece of shit software. I hate stealing pictures of the internet.
the-dump 2021-05-02 21:22:28 Plus, that all I use it for is making profile pictures and characters. I don't do nsfw, I'm not one of *them*.
the-dump 2021-05-02 21:22:59 Those people disgust me.
the-dump 2021-05-02 21:23:15 **ahem**
the-dump 2021-05-02 21:24:16 Someone's going to point out that I stole a pfp from the internet.
the-dump 2021-05-02 21:24:34 And I'd much rather make my own than be lazy.
the-dump 2021-05-02 21:26:22 Then why are you complaining about my profile picture? It's not copyrighted and it's original.
the-dump 2021-05-02 21:27:11 I literally only use it to make characters.
Nothing else.
the-dump 2021-05-02 21:28:17 Fuck you all. I hope you get the urge to sneeze but you never actually do.
