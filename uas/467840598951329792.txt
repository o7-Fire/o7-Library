help 2021-05-12 02:05:48 oh
help 2021-05-12 02:05:51 so just for looks
help 2021-05-12 02:22:16 what do they do
help 2021-05-12 02:48:32 why does my elevator get stuck when there's another person's plane on it but it's fine when I go up and down on it
help 2021-05-12 11:58:23 I know that, it's an elevator for a carrier. Whenever I use a plane on it the elevator works fine but when my friend uses a plane on it, it glitches out.
help 2021-05-12 12:00:41 I have the force thing set at 2500 if that's what you meant
help 2021-05-12 12:08:38 would suspension on the other plane help maybe?

bug-reports 2021-06-03 22:07:12 nice
bug-reports 2021-06-03 22:07:14 lol
bug-reports 2021-06-03 22:18:30 I thought I was the only one
bug-reports 2021-06-03 22:18:31 phew
bug-reports 2021-06-03 22:24:36 and the water
bug-reports 2021-06-03 22:25:18 you can literally fly through the water LOL
bug-reports 2021-06-03 22:27:01 lol
bug-reports 2021-06-03 22:32:42 I joined a private sevrer and it works fine
creations-chat 2021-06-21 22:26:17 is that why people are downvoting I wonder
creations-chat 2021-06-21 22:28:37 I'll post one where you can actually see lol
creations-chat 2021-06-21 22:33:34 that's weird it says 6 downvotes on my screen
creations-chat 2021-06-21 22:51:36 feedback?
creations-chat 2021-06-21 22:53:45 gotcha, I do think the bridge could use a redo
creations-chat 2021-06-21 22:56:04 the bridge on the real thing is pretty far back though so how far should I move it up?
creations-chat 2021-06-21 23:12:31 so I think I should do these things: rebuild the bridge to make it more accurate (not moving it though), build some jets, make a crane, and add some more detail to the stern but how would I do weathering?
creations-chat 2021-07-12 21:33:57 is that an osprey
help 2021-07-13 01:18:13 does anyone have any tips I guess on how to weather an aircraft carrier
creations-chat 2021-07-13 15:09:44 The shape looks good but I think it extends too much
creations-chat 2021-07-13 15:52:39 you can find tutorials on youtube if you just want something cool looking but just don't post a tutorial in <#384025409945337856> or act like it's your own
creations-chat 2021-07-13 15:54:40 :( just trying to help sorry
creations-chat 2021-07-13 16:16:18 ^plus it feels way better when you made it yourself
creations-chat 2021-07-13 16:20:40 unless it's a tutorial for motor locking or folding or something right
creations-chat 2021-07-13 16:42:33 feedback
creations-chat 2021-07-13 16:47:17 nice I like it but maybe you could add like a rollcage
creations-chat 2021-07-13 16:49:21 bruh what does that have to do with anything why is everyone a asshole
creations-chat 2021-07-13 16:55:21 does the suspension work
