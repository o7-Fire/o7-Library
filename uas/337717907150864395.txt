bug-reports 2020-11-26 18:46:17 Motors sometimes fling off my build and slowly come back to it. This includes whatever was attached to the motor. It's not an often issue but it is an issue none the less.
bug-reports 2020-11-26 19:25:17 Nah it's not motorlocked. Just servo toggle type 2 motors folding things.
bug-reports 2020-11-29 02:16:19 Ok so
bug-reports 2020-11-29 02:16:53 I was using mobile to try and get some good screenies of my spitfire and I noticed not all the control buttons showed up on screen
bug-reports 2020-11-29 02:17:14 The only buttons that showed up were the ones for the trap doors and the landing gears, nothing else
bug-reports 2020-11-29 02:18:00 
bug-reports 2020-11-29 02:18:15 Nothing except those 3. Edit : pinned messages say I need to include device type. Samsung J2 phone.

[Pvp] [Naval] 
So, once again im suggesting naval guns. 2 types of calibers, long range and short range. Calibers 2 to 8 inches are short range, and have a faster reload time. Calibers 9 to 18 are long range and have a slow reload time. As the caliber goes up, the reload time gets slower. Calibers 15 to 18 inch will have a reload time of 37.5 seconds are to prevent spam. The block design for these weapons will be a cylinder. 18inch guns are the exact size of a cylinder, and it gets progressively smaller from there.

the-dump 2021-02-05 02:45:49 Hey guys
the-dump 2021-02-05 02:45:57 Wanna see something gross?
the-dump 2021-02-05 02:46:43 My cat's claw has evidently grown into a loop, and has now gone into her paw pad. Atm she is fine but here is scab that came out of the middle of the loop
the-dump 2021-02-05 02:47:42 I would give yall a grosser picture of the actual claw, but naturally the cat wont stay fucking still
the-dump 2021-02-05 02:48:29 Oh please it doesnt have puss and shit in it (yet)
the-dump 2021-02-05 02:48:42 Yeah she doesnt act like its there at all.
the-dump 2021-02-05 02:49:19 But once it gets through the claw pad and into her skin, guaranteed she'll feel it.
the-dump 2021-02-05 02:51:46 Finally, she gave in. Heres a shot of the claw (still not getting the full scale of it but better than a scab)
the-dump 2021-02-05 02:52:16 Yes
the-dump 2021-02-05 02:52:19 She acts like a dog
the-dump 2021-02-05 02:52:25 She sleeps and licks people
the-dump 2021-02-05 02:52:31 But she does go outside
the-dump 2021-02-05 02:53:22 Whats odd is the other toe on her other paw isnt big. Not even average sized. Its a midgit claw
the-dump 2021-02-05 02:55:32 Ok thats fucking good!
the-dump 2021-02-05 02:56:53 What?
the-dump 2021-02-05 02:57:13 My cat didnt get the memo
the-dump 2021-02-05 02:57:19 I doubt it
the-dump 2021-02-05 02:57:49 Seriously though my cat didnt get the memo and now she has a looped claw digging into her
the-dump 2021-02-05 02:58:05 Wanna see it?
the-dump 2021-02-05 02:58:11 NOOOOO
the-dump 2021-02-05 02:58:28 She doesnt feel it atm. Its only in her claw pad so far.
the-dump 2021-02-05 02:58:37 Thats one hell of a trooper
the-dump 2021-02-05 02:58:51 True
the-dump 2021-02-05 02:59:15 The question is how to cut the claw off without this cat going berserk
the-dump 2021-02-05 03:00:21 All my cats scratch shit. I will always see them scratching stuff once a day. I think its because of her polydactly (having an extra claw/thumb) and thus this claw didnt get scratched
the-dump 2021-02-05 03:00:52 Eh
the-dump 2021-02-05 03:01:28 Thats Japan

creations-chat 2021-03-22 00:32:21 <@754238494083252224> maybe add some curves in the fuselage with wedges and make it not a block? Also add some bombs and shrink the tail fins, besides that you're good.
creations-chat 2021-03-22 00:37:31 Debatable, im looking at a schematic and the tail fins on yours are pretty big
creations-chat 2021-03-22 00:40:11 Make them shorter by 2 blocks and then itll be scale ,because it appears on the schematic the tail fins end at the prop's center, hope that schematic helps.

creations-chat 2021-05-16 20:10:38 Thats the thing. It aint a real jet so you can't say its inaccurate. Color scheme is simple yet appealing, and the motorlock is subtle but excellent.

the-dump 2021-06-08 02:07:18 Round 1
the-dump 2021-06-08 02:07:55 What ive never gotten is why transformers keep the seats in their vehicle modes
the-dump 2021-06-08 02:08:10 No one is gonna fucking drive you if you're a decepticon
the-dump 2021-06-08 02:08:34 Or use holograms

the-dump 2021-06-08 02:09:03 They still have seats
the-dump 2021-06-08 02:09:05 Why
the-dump 2021-06-08 02:09:41 Just darken your glass man
the-dump 2021-06-08 02:09:50 Or make a hologram of the damn chair

the-dump 2021-06-08 02:10:27 Idk
the-dump 2021-06-08 02:10:52 I guess not having the chair means theres room for something else in the robot mode.
