the-dump 2020-07-08 17:34:42 Holy f*bleeep*
the-dump 2020-07-08 17:35:06 It somehow managed to damage its funnel too.
the-dump 2020-07-08 17:35:27 *grey = damage*
the-dump 2020-07-08 17:58:15 Bruh
the-dump 2020-07-08 17:58:37 Autopilot and the collision avoidance system was on
the-dump 2020-07-08 17:58:44 I have no idea what it hit..
the-dump 2020-07-08 18:05:46 When you try to roast someone and they say *"No U"*
the-dump 2020-07-08 18:07:44 Its spraying itself
the-dump 2020-07-08 18:08:13 Supposed to be spraying forwards, but because of the ship's speed it just goes back at the windshield.
the-dump 2020-07-08 18:09:13 The ship was going 62 MPH at that point
the-dump 2020-07-08 18:09:32 Or 101 KPH
the-dump 2020-07-08 18:10:12 So it was going fast for a ship
the-dump 2020-07-08 18:10:28 
the-dump 2020-07-08 18:10:51 That's in knots. Shove that in a calculator to get mph or kph
the-dump 2020-07-08 18:10:59 Yeah.
the-dump 2020-07-08 18:11:09 But plane crazy doesnt have a definite speed unit
the-dump 2020-07-08 18:11:27 Its just speed.
the-dump 2020-07-08 18:11:47 What unit? How would you compare it to a realistic build if you're doing a direct replica?
the-dump 2020-07-08 18:12:14 Liek for example,  if you wanted to do a replica of the carnival dream..
the-dump 2020-07-08 18:12:26 Everything down to the top speed (22 knots)
the-dump 2020-07-08 18:12:35 How would you figure that out?
the-dump 2020-07-08 18:14:18 Bruh
the-dump 2020-07-08 18:14:54 What unit is it closest to irl
the-dump 2020-07-08 18:14:59 M/s?
the-dump 2020-07-08 18:15:06 Feet per seccond?
the-dump 2020-07-08 18:15:27 I know stormworks defaults to meters per seccond
the-dump 2020-07-08 18:16:01 Hence how I can do all those conversions on my yacht's top speed
the-dump 2020-07-08 18:17:07 So basically you would take the plane crazy speed and divide by 20
the-dump 2020-07-08 18:17:21 Then convert that from m/s to whatever
the-dump 2020-07-08 18:20:45 
the-dump 2020-07-08 18:21:07 Tell me that's not accurate
the-dump 2020-07-08 18:21:16 Uh no
the-dump 2020-07-08 18:21:27 
the-dump 2020-07-08 18:21:39 How the bots think squeakers are
the-dump 2020-07-08 18:21:47 Ots true though isnt it
the-dump 2020-07-08 18:23:23 Teabag submarine?
the-dump 2020-07-08 18:25:35 Its falling
the-dump 2020-07-08 18:25:38 Into the void
the-dump 2020-07-08 18:25:52 HMMM

the-dump 2020-07-26 05:23:58 What have I created
the-dump 2020-07-26 07:51:14 <@338393512389378059>
the-dump 2020-07-26 07:52:00 .
the-dump 2020-07-26 08:06:39 
the-dump 2020-07-26 08:07:06 > Hug me
DHMIS
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:24:43 Phase 2 complete
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:25:10 You have no idea how much I had to fight my laptop to record that
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:25:19 3 hours
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:25:38 3 hours of fighting my laptop
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:25:45 For these 20 secconds
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:26:23 Notice what's new on it?
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:28:41 Yeah and the NAV lights as well as an extended superstructure
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:28:58 Also comms antennas
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:30:17 Bruh
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:30:27 Its been upgraded
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:30:37 Phase 2 of the superstructure construction
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:31:28 
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:31:43 First picture is before today seccond picture is after today
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:32:08 ..
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:32:23 Because I'm proud of it.
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:32:25 That's why
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:32:41 The bow better?
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:32:52 Wdym.
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:33:09 The stern will be smoothed out in phase 4
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:33:39 Phase 2 which was today's work was just the superstructure improvements
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:34:07 Might start work on smoothening the stern tomorrow
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:34:21 Hmm
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:34:39 This is about a week's worth of work
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:35:04 The hull will be improved tomorrow..
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:35:18 Tug?
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:35:20 Ah
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:35:38 It's like that for a reasion
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:35:58 Cant make it rounder
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:36:09 Thats the roundest that's possible in stormworks
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:36:24 Oh
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:36:38 I see what you mean by fireboat resemblance
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:36:49 It kinda does double as one.
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:37:14 *you've seen the demo of the water cannon I assume*
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:37:30 Yes?
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:38:06 What do you mean by that?
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:38:14 Like, not being smooth?
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:38:38 Ease of building
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:38:57 OH
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:39:03 I get what you mean
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:39:08 The stripe right?
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:39:20 The blue stripe?
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:39:34 Or you're not talking about color?
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:41:08 Hmm.
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:41:21 I don't go for realism..
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:41:43 Also tbh the most efficient hull you can have in stormworks is a block.
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:41:47 No joke
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:42:00 Jeez!
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:42:20 That Sucker is **HUGE**
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:42:36 Right right
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:42:47 I like to make my hulls smooth
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:43:21 Eh, and I'm fine with that
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:43:35 Keep in mind that all my ships are fictional
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:43:42 The PT Jumper especially
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:44:02 There is no way a ship that weight and size could hydrofoil in the real world
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:44:28 Sure
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:45:03 This is one of the few I have of it hydrofoiling
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:45:05 I don't record much
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:45:40 See that black trail by the rudders?
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:46:00 That's an infinite generator,  its basically an exploit
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:46:13 That's what powers the hydrofoil motors
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:47:54 Lol
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:48:12 Jumper class yachts... wouldnt be effective in offensive or defensive
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:48:29 It's only able to be armed with a fluid cannon
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:50:23 Yep
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:50:44 It can hit a top speed of 110 knots with the foils active and jumping mode active
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:51:03 Usually it sticks around 80 or 90 knots when foiling
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:51:35 I've memed the engine blow footage
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:51:38 Wanna see?
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:51:47 > that gif looked around 40 kots
<@471095469402095627> 
Bad framerate
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:52:00 
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:52:37 Also
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:52:43 That was purposely done
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:53:00 I actually rigged up the ship to exploade on command for that
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:53:12 It was part of a joke
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:54:15 Yep
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:54:32 Its the same gif just cut and sped up
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:54:51 Yep
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:55:37 You see the gif on my pfp?
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:56:08 This one
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:56:08 
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:56:18 That was an accident
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:57:16 Yeah the electric motors will overwhelm the engines when they're backfed into them
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:57:32 Yep
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:57:48 Generators and prop drivers
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:58:05 The electric motors act as, sort of a nitro system
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:58:13 Gives the ship a boost
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:58:47 The generators run on the same shaft, so yes and no
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:59:08 What exploded was the diesel engines
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:59:24 Also know that exploit I was telling you about?
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:59:35 The inf generator
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:59:50 Yes but the diesel engines can also power the props
the-dump 2020-07-27 05:00:09 The diesel engines primarily power the props alongside the gens
the-dump 2020-07-27 05:00:17 The electric motors serve as a boost
the-dump 2020-07-27 05:00:53 Noe.
the-dump 2020-07-27 05:01:08 The diesel engines can power the props without the electric motors
the-dump 2020-07-27 05:01:18 Its just, really slow
the-dump 2020-07-27 05:01:31 Like 16 knots
the-dump 2020-07-27 05:01:56 > what is you are talking to about
<@472553877711880211> 
PT Jumper, one of my ships
the-dump 2020-07-27 05:02:04 That's the auxiliary
the-dump 2020-07-27 05:02:15 Nah
the-dump 2020-07-27 05:02:48 This will answer that question
the-dump 2020-07-27 05:03:06 Yes lol
the-dump 2020-07-27 05:03:12 XD
the-dump 2020-07-27 05:03:26 Gearbox trickary
the-dump 2020-07-27 05:03:37 That's how it goes so fast with the electric motors
the-dump 2020-07-27 05:04:11 1:12 ratio for the boost
the-dump 2020-07-27 05:04:15 Yep
the-dump 2020-07-27 05:04:27 Noe...
the-dump 2020-07-27 05:04:38 Both run the props
the-dump 2020-07-27 05:04:53 The diesel engines and the boost motors run the props
the-dump 2020-07-27 05:05:03 They can do it individually or in unison
the-dump 2020-07-27 05:05:16 The inf gen powers the motors
the-dump 2020-07-27 05:05:27 That's the black smoke comming from the stern
the-dump 2020-07-27 05:05:34 Just an exploit
the-dump 2020-07-27 05:05:37 That's all lol
the-dump 2020-07-27 05:05:47 Basically a flywheel
the-dump 2020-07-27 05:05:54 That's being crushed into turning
the-dump 2020-07-27 05:06:09 Then the physics of said wheel makes it spin like crazy
the-dump 2020-07-27 05:06:26 Lol
the-dump 2020-07-27 05:06:40 Because off topic discussion
the-dump 2020-07-27 05:06:57 > Because off topic discussion
the-dump 2020-07-27 05:07:34 Idk
the-dump 2020-07-27 05:07:53 
the-dump 2020-07-27 05:08:04 XD
the-dump 2020-07-27 05:09:42 Oh yeah the jumper can also fire derpy missiles
the-dump 2020-07-27 05:10:13 They have no guidance
the-dump 2020-07-27 05:11:03 
the-dump 2020-07-27 05:11:35 I've slammed it into everything I could to sink it
the-dump 2020-07-27 05:11:45 Took like 40 hits on the bow
the-dump 2020-07-27 05:12:50 It got wedged in the ice once too
the-dump 2020-07-27 05:13:06 The bridge was all screwed up and unresponsive
the-dump 2020-07-27 05:14:52 Nah.
the-dump 2020-07-27 05:15:16 That's why
the-dump 2020-07-27 05:15:42 The control panels and helm were absolutely obliterated
the-dump 2020-07-27 05:15:55 Shouldn't have went afk.
the-dump 2020-07-27 05:16:26 I went afk.. and the collision avoidance system bugged and got itself cornered
the-dump 2020-07-27 05:17:27 Stormworks logic
the-dump 2020-07-27 06:26:14 SPEED
the-dump 2020-07-27 06:26:23 Look at the radar lol
the-dump 2020-07-27 07:50:10 https://youtu.be/SumgbxvEV04
We must blast this on curiosity 
Or build a rover that can blast it!
the-dump 2020-07-27 18:08:53 Hull phase 3 completed
the-dump 2020-07-28 08:17:48 Imagine hand drawing a full length movie..
*every animator before Toy Story* "Am I a joke to you?"
the-dump 2020-07-28 08:37:08 Burn it
the-dump 2020-07-28 08:37:33 Q
the-dump 2020-07-28 21:20:01 Noe
the-dump 2020-07-28 21:44:19 ...
the-dump 2020-07-28 21:44:30 
the-dump 2020-07-28 21:45:37 Wot
the-dump 2020-07-28 21:45:59 Lol
the-dump 2020-07-28 21:46:12 Its a rickroll that only works with light theme
the-dump 2020-07-28 21:46:15 Lol
the-dump 2020-07-28 21:46:19 Sometimes dark theme
the-dump 2020-07-28 21:46:36 
the-dump 2020-07-28 21:46:43 Boatt
the-dump 2020-07-28 21:46:55 Can you guys actually make this out?
the-dump 2020-07-28 21:46:58 PC users.
the-dump 2020-07-28 21:47:31 You on computer?
the-dump 2020-07-28 21:47:37 Its enlarged for mobile
the-dump 2020-07-28 21:47:47 It's supposed to be tiny
the-dump 2020-07-28 21:48:05 Ah
the-dump 2020-07-28 21:48:11 Boate
the-dump 2020-07-28 21:48:26 Original
the-dump 2020-07-28 21:48:49 It's slow tho
the-dump 2020-07-28 21:49:10 The actual ship is slow as hecc
the-dump 2020-07-28 21:49:20 Maybe
the-dump 2020-07-28 21:49:28 This is stormworks tho :p
the-dump 2020-07-28 21:49:43 Stormworks=Plane Crazy 2?
the-dump 2020-07-28 21:49:57 XD
the-dump 2020-07-28 21:50:15 They're raising the price to 24 USD September 17th
the-dump 2020-07-28 21:50:26 Because it's being taken out of early access
the-dump 2020-07-28 21:51:27 Abstract art be like
the-dump 2020-07-28 21:51:47 
the-dump 2020-07-28 21:56:08 Wot
the-dump 2020-07-28 21:58:26 
the-dump 2020-07-28 22:15:59 Oh
the-dump 2020-07-28 22:16:16 Can you guys make out what this is?
the-dump 2020-07-28 22:16:34 I assume not
the-dump 2020-07-28 22:16:47 Yes its the same as my pfp...
the-dump 2020-07-28 22:16:56 Just recut and sped up, as well as shrunk
the-dump 2020-07-28 22:17:15 
the-dump 2020-07-28 22:17:20 Its this
the-dump 2020-07-28 22:17:32 Look at the radar tho
the-dump 2020-07-28 22:18:07 It's nowhere near 60 fps
the-dump 2020-07-28 22:18:09 That's sped up
the-dump 2020-07-28 22:18:37 Its edited to be faster
the-dump 2020-07-28 22:20:06 This is closer to the real speed
the-dump 2020-07-28 22:21:04 This is the real speed
the-dump 2020-07-28 22:21:24 I has like 7 or 9 fps at the time
the-dump 2020-07-28 22:22:06 The ship is even slower now
the-dump 2020-07-28 22:22:30 Eh
the-dump 2020-07-28 22:22:35 Because I'm proud of it
the-dump 2020-07-28 22:22:38 That's why
the-dump 2020-07-28 22:22:50 Also this *is* out of date
the-dump 2020-07-28 22:23:19 I've gotta fight my computer to record another short of it...
the-dump 2020-07-28 22:23:56 E
the-dump 2020-07-28 22:24:06 My laptop takes forever to load up..
the-dump 2020-07-28 22:24:26 Just wish I could buy a desktop unit now, from selling the damned craptop.
the-dump 2020-07-28 22:24:49 CRAP
the-dump 2020-07-28 22:25:16 Oh nevermind
the-dump 2020-07-28 22:25:32 I was just siked by a craptop
the-dump 2020-07-28 22:25:59 I'm saving for a desktop unit
the-dump 2020-07-28 22:26:11 That's goanna be 50 times better than this piece of trash
the-dump 2020-07-28 22:27:08 Wonder if I could sell it for the price it was bought at
the-dump 2020-07-28 22:27:27 Its 2 years old
the-dump 2020-07-28 22:27:38 My current one is an HP 15-F387WM
the-dump 2020-07-28 22:27:46 Not really
the-dump 2020-07-28 22:28:04 But since we've done so much work some panels on the keyboard tend to unsnap themselves
the-dump 2020-07-28 22:28:19 And the keyboard comes up from time to time
the-dump 2020-07-28 22:28:43 Uh..
the-dump 2020-07-28 22:28:50 500? I'm not sure
the-dump 2020-07-28 22:29:01 I know they aren't made anymore
the-dump 2020-07-28 22:29:24 Aw
the-dump 2020-07-28 22:29:38 I was hoping for at least 300
the-dump 2020-07-28 22:30:09 Hmm.
the-dump 2020-07-28 22:30:13 Thatd be better tbh
the-dump 2020-07-28 22:30:26 Ah oh well
the-dump 2020-07-28 22:30:46 I'll just have to resist the urge to snap this thing in half for another year or so
the-dump 2020-07-28 22:31:26 > Ru able to add an ssd to it
<@335599526414909451> 
What?
the-dump 2020-07-28 22:31:47 I'm not sure it would even work with a SSD
the-dump 2020-07-28 22:34:02 Yep
the-dump 2020-07-28 22:34:33 Uh no.
the-dump 2020-07-28 22:34:47 What for?
the-dump 2020-07-28 22:35:14 AMD A8 integrated graphics..
the-dump 2020-07-28 22:35:18 4gb ram..
the-dump 2020-07-28 22:35:23 1tb HDD
the-dump 2020-07-28 22:35:31 With a little over 400 left
the-dump 2020-07-28 22:35:51 > Its hot garbage
<@335599526414909451> 
Yet people wonder why I wanna snap it in half somethimes
the-dump 2020-07-28 22:36:08 I'm not sure about the price
the-dump 2020-07-28 22:36:19 My parents bought it for school
the-dump 2020-07-28 22:36:31 It got me in trouble ALL THE TIME for how slow it was
the-dump 2020-07-28 22:36:45 My laptop hates discord
the-dump 2020-07-28 22:36:49 4gb ram sucks
the-dump 2020-07-28 22:37:16 We were supposed to get more but I was talked out of it, because my laptop is a lost cause
the-dump 2020-07-28 22:37:26 I tried
the-dump 2020-07-28 22:37:42 But, nobody listens and instead blames what's on my file
the-dump 2020-07-28 22:37:59 Files..
the-dump 2020-07-28 22:38:02 Games and such.
the-dump 2020-07-28 22:38:19 We spent almost 800 bucks on a new laptop for school
the-dump 2020-07-28 22:38:25 And its 100 times faster
the-dump 2020-07-28 22:38:37 Because it's actually WORTH the money
the-dump 2020-07-28 22:38:55 What the hell
the-dump 2020-07-28 22:39:51 My theme just reset itself

the-dump 2020-09-16 06:42:00 How people talk with people trying to build a good pc on a budget
the-dump 2020-09-16 06:42:18 My point, is RGB is needless
the-dump 2020-09-16 06:43:42 Listen here
the-dump 2020-09-16 06:43:56 RGB , red green blue lights are just lights
the-dump 2020-09-16 06:44:05 Useless to the overall computing
the-dump 2020-09-16 06:44:32 Looks are the only thing it stands for
the-dump 2020-09-16 06:45:14 And for someone on a budget that just wants to play some stormworks (highly unoptomized) RGB doesn't matter worth a crap.
the-dump 2020-09-16 06:46:06 If I wanted RGB, I've got a long as crap LED strip I can shove in the computer
the-dump 2020-09-16 06:46:24 Or behind it
the-dump 2020-09-16 06:46:35 Nah
the-dump 2020-09-16 06:46:40 I'll hang it like a noose
the-dump 2020-09-16 06:46:48 Then have it on red at all times
the-dump 2020-09-16 06:47:00 Nah
the-dump 2020-09-16 06:47:07 Relevant
the-dump 2020-09-16 06:47:24 Pluto is worse
the-dump 2020-09-16 06:47:56 My point is
the-dump 2020-09-16 06:48:23 Dont waste cash on RGB, just get some strip lights and a controller and you're set for any RGB needs.
the-dump 2020-09-16 06:48:46

the-dump 2020-09-30 13:06:10 XD
the-dump 2020-09-30 13:07:16 Imagine what JFK would think about modern America
the-dump 2020-09-30 13:07:30 Or George Washington
the-dump 2020-09-30 13:07:51 ;-;

the-dump 2020-09-30 13:22:11 Because all I see are flashing lights of the characters and them yelling
the-dump 2020-09-30 13:26:13 My opinion on bullying,  and the time when I snapped.
the-dump 2020-09-30 13:27:09 For those who couldn't figure it out, said "bomb" never went off
the-dump 2020-09-30 13:27:24 Never was a bomb in the first place
the-dump 2020-09-30 13:27:33 Was more of a fire hazard.
the-dump 2020-09-30 13:28:49 This applies to personality too.
Like me for example,  I'll get overly excited about random things because of my ADHD.
the-dump 2020-09-30 13:51:01 > <@426802747875131393> thats too fucking far even for me

the-dump 2020-09-30 13:54:47 I'm no longer suicidal..

the-dump 2020-09-30 13:55:11 Hmm
the-dump 2020-09-30 13:55:55 When you are so overworked and stressed that you want to stab/melt/kill something
the-dump 2020-09-30 13:56:14 Me to a random 9V battery: You're dead
the-dump 2020-09-30 13:57:26 Mm
the-dump 2020-09-30 13:57:51 Honestly I've gotta get out of my current issues before that reality slap comes in.
the-dump 2020-09-30 14:01:26 Honestly, 2020 has been hell, but 2020 made my hopes collapse with the passing of my old doggo, but made my hopes rise when I met Emily.
the-dump 2020-09-30 14:02:09 *"We head into the darkness to find the light"*
Perfect description of 2020 for me so far.

Literally what meme channels are for.
the-dump 2021-01-12 10:24:26 It should only be pointed out if said post is controversial or offensive.
the-dump 2021-01-12 10:24:59 Minimod

Recently found out that it was a fan's render of her.
the-dump 2021-01-15 04:49:57 I would get a screenshot of the character in game, but I had to uninstall Arknights for storage.
the-dump 2021-01-15 04:50:16 And to top it off, I forgot the character's name.

the-dump 2021-01-15 06:16:52 The audio in this, if you couldn't tell is called Peak Inverse

the-dump 2021-01-15 07:38:40 Could be the earth
the-dump 2021-01-15 07:39:00 Maybe a similar phenomenon that causes the moon phases
the-dump 2021-01-15 07:39:30 Or maybe someone photoshopped a crescent moon on the moon landing picture.
the-dump 2021-01-15 07:40:40 Horn

the-dump 2021-01-16 03:47:20 Still sus
the-dump 2021-01-17 04:51:36 Peak Inverse.
the-dump 2021-01-17 04:51:55 Figured I'd post 2 more audios here...
the-dump 2021-01-17 04:52:06 Eh?
the-dump 2021-01-17 04:52:17 
the-dump 2021-01-17 04:52:28 He left?
the-dump 2021-01-17 04:52:34 Ouf
the-dump 2021-01-17 04:53:16 
the-dump 2021-01-17 04:53:26 Day 2 of recommending this song
the-dump 2021-01-17 04:54:17 Honestly, it has a kind of calming vibe
the-dump 2021-01-18 04:54:03 
the-dump 2021-01-19 14:38:32 I'd hate to say, but I might be getting into media from across the Pacific Ocean.
You can see where I'm going with this.
the-dump 2021-01-19 14:42:03 Reasonable reaction
the-dump 2021-01-19 14:42:42 I've fought the want to try it for a while now..
But alas, when a song gets stuck in your head it torments you until you find a source.
the-dump 2021-01-19 14:44:34 Eh.
the-dump 2021-01-19 14:44:53 My mind has been eroded faster than Grand Isle Louisiana by high school
the-dump 2021-01-19 14:45:04 It'll never be that far
the-dump 2021-01-19 14:45:59 Yeah...
That's not happening
the-dump 2021-01-19 14:47:19 Although, this experience could have the potential to make me multilingual
the-dump 2021-01-19 14:48:32 Honestly, I'm not getting into it because of another person.
the-dump 2021-01-19 14:48:55 I've slipped across a few audio tracks from the series, and now they're stuck in my head...
the-dump 2021-01-19 14:49:26 Soo now I'm  hoping that seeing the context they were used in will get rid of them looping.
the-dump 2021-01-19 14:49:42 Hmmm seems legit
the-dump 2021-01-19 14:49:46 I relate
the-dump 2021-01-19 14:50:19 Insanity intensifies
the-dump 2021-01-19 14:51:25 I mean, I've been near my breaking point before, and I don't want to go back.
the-dump 2021-01-19 14:51:46 I don't like myself when I'm in that state...
the-dump 2021-01-19 14:52:23 I used to be suicidal
the-dump 2021-01-19 14:52:58 I actually almost took my own life...
But now I've realized through therapy that suicide or death is not the answer.
the-dump 2021-01-19 14:53:47 Let me just say, High School is hell. For those who haven't been through it yet.
***Prepare for the worst!***
the-dump 2021-01-19 14:54:30 No, I might end up attempting suicide again
the-dump 2021-01-19 14:54:49 And this is completely unrelated to my school career.
the-dump 2021-01-19 14:55:31 Like I said, I used to be suicidal.
the-dump 2021-01-19 14:55:44 Because yes, that's why
the-dump 2021-01-19 14:56:05 What is life, an illusion?
the-dump 2021-01-19 14:56:32 You could've offered a year ago when I was fighting the urge to end it all....
the-dump 2021-01-19 14:56:55 But support helps.....
It's nice to know others care about you.
the-dump 2021-01-19 14:57:26 See, the way to prevent a suicide is to make the person feel wanted in this world.
the-dump 2021-01-19 14:58:04 Or when your mind makes you *think* that.
And torments you for it
the-dump 2021-01-19 14:58:50 Eh, like I said, life is an illusion
the-dump 2021-01-19 14:59:11 The dump is literally a dump for random *bleep*
the-dump 2021-01-19 15:00:08 What for
the-dump 2021-01-19 15:00:31 .
the-dump 2021-01-19 15:00:36 I see watermark
the-dump 2021-01-19 15:01:38 You've ruined your spellcheck
the-dump 2021-01-19 15:02:09 Ah
the-dump 2021-01-19 15:03:27 Because yes...
the-dump 2021-01-19 15:03:33 Notice how I've stopped
the-dump 2021-01-19 15:03:47 I've already had therapy, for 7 months
the-dump 2021-01-19 15:04:48 I meant notice how I've stopped talking about it.
the-dump 2021-01-19 15:05:15 In most cases, yes
the-dump 2021-01-19 15:06:08 In others however, it isn't the therapy that helps.
It's the feeling of purpose in this world.
However,  not everyone can be saved by their self inflicted demise.
the-dump 2021-01-19 15:06:27 He asked
the-dump 2021-01-19 15:07:57 You have to find your purpose.
the-dump 2021-01-20 16:05:19 Truth: Am I a joke to you?
the-dump 2021-01-20 22:26:39 What the hell happened here
the-dump 2021-01-21 15:03:03 funi audio
the-dump 2021-01-23 04:26:01 Guys...
the-dump 2021-01-23 04:26:42 Listen to this, it's only 3 weeks old..
And in my opinion it's good.
https://youtu.be/rvIIiSWfa8E
the-dump 2021-01-23 04:27:09 What?
the-dump 2021-01-23 04:28:21 Because yes, that's why
the-dump 2021-01-23 04:29:28 Arknights really likes pairing Steve Aoki with RUNN
the-dump 2021-01-23 04:30:06 Last of me, and End like this, have them paired.
the-dump 2021-01-23 04:31:09 I mean, I'm not complaining, they're great working together..
But it's just a little funny.

the-dump 2021-08-23 19:49:36 Here's some nostalgia.

*Creeper Rap*
the-dump 2021-09-07 03:02:33 When you have a good car you built, and screw with the traction control
the-dump 2021-09-07 03:03:05 Hi there
the-dump 2021-09-07 03:04:16 
the-dump 2021-09-07 03:04:29 Electric race car go brr.
the-dump 2021-09-07 03:05:37 It goes so fast now that it thinks it's a plane..
And I had to make the spoiler dynamic.
the-dump 2021-09-07 03:11:03 Yes.
That's the name of the car.
the-dump 2021-09-07 03:11:15 Because it's electric.
the-dump 2021-09-07 03:11:50 Thanks.
One of the few good names I can come up with.
the-dump 2021-09-07 03:12:40 The electro was actually built because someone else thought I couldn't build a race car.
the-dump 2021-09-07 03:13:23 Stormworks, Build and Rescue
the-dump 2021-09-07 03:15:57 This is the previous race car, the one before electro.
the-dump 2021-09-07 03:16:07 This one's retired now.
the-dump 2021-09-07 03:16:35 It would always pop wheelies, and blow itself up
the-dump 2021-09-07 03:16:46 The spoiler you see is fake..
It does nothing
the-dump 2021-09-07 03:17:01 Electro is my first racer to use an actual spoiler.
the-dump 2021-09-07 03:17:15 Yes, and boats.
And helicopters.
And tanks
the-dump 2021-09-07 03:17:21 And landships
the-dump 2021-09-07 03:17:29 25USD currently.
the-dump 2021-09-07 03:17:41 Ikr
the-dump 2021-09-07 03:17:57 Weapons dlc comming out soon..
Like, in a few weeks
the-dump 2021-09-07 03:18:27 This was my first race car ever built. 
Nicknamed the beatle
the-dump 2021-09-07 03:18:40 Never made it to the track.
the-dump 2021-09-07 03:18:57 It would flip over, and like a beatle, would get stuck.
the-dump 2021-09-07 03:19:14 Also had a major traction issue.
the-dump 2021-09-07 03:19:33 Tbh now that I think of it, electro is my first one to have TCS.
the-dump 2021-09-07 03:19:40 Ironik
the-dump 2021-09-07 03:20:20 Found a pic of the gen 2 car doing a wheelie
the-dump 2021-09-07 03:21:51 35 is HTI's racing number. All the cars have that number.
the-dump 2021-09-07 03:22:10 Technically incorrect
the-dump 2021-09-07 03:22:25 Stormworks isn't as exploitable as plane crazy is
the-dump 2021-09-07 03:22:51 And besides.. 
Crap like shredders are impossible,  since stormworks has actual drag.
the-dump 2021-09-07 03:24:25 Did I stutter?
the-dump 2021-09-07 03:46:11 Me slidin away from my problems
the-dump 2021-09-07 03:47:19 Do it
the-dump 2021-09-07 03:47:24 I wanna see you try.
the-dump 2021-09-07 03:47:36 Purely from scratch. No workshop stuff
the-dump 2021-09-07 03:48:19 I built electro from scratch..
It got its vintage shape on accident
the-dump 2021-09-07 03:48:46 Well, electro is a converted version of an old street use car..
Which was vintage shaped on accident.
the-dump 2021-09-07 03:49:06 I don't remember what I was going for tbh
the-dump 2021-09-07 03:49:31 What car looks better, 1, 2, or 3?
the-dump 2021-09-07 03:50:00 I also have some utility busses, but I don't have a pic on my phone
the-dump 2021-09-07 03:50:13 Not until DLC drops
the-dump 2021-09-07 03:50:21 Negative.
the-dump 2021-09-07 03:50:40 E
the-dump 2021-09-07 03:50:57 Yes
the-dump 2021-09-07 03:51:00 You can
the-dump 2021-09-07 03:51:10 Uhhhh.
the-dump 2021-09-07 03:51:16 Well yes, but actually no

the-dump 2021-09-07 03:54:28

the-dump 2021-09-13 03:18:32 We do a mild amount of tomfoolery
the-dump 2021-09-13 03:19:23 Want context or nah?
the-dump 2021-09-13 03:19:50 Context: I bashed it like 10 times with a landship, and ended up having to put it out
the-dump 2021-09-13 03:20:35 Brought another version of it for firefighting,  and that burst into flames because of the nearby radiation leak from an exploaded reactor trailer
the-dump 2021-09-13 03:21:22 Needless to say, I may or may not have caused a 7 vehicle fire by doing a joyride at an airport with a landship.
the-dump 2021-09-13 03:21:33 *stormworks build and rescue*
the-dump 2021-09-13 03:21:53 Ye
the-dump 2021-09-13 03:22:19 To put the fires out, I had to get the primitive Ab3.
the-dump 2021-09-13 03:22:55 Since I had to gut the firefighting equipment off of the AB4 (which caught fire from the trailer exploading)
the-dump 2021-09-13 03:23:56 Anyways,

the-dump 2021-09-13 04:14:13 No
the-dump 2021-09-13 04:14:49 Leave the anime landship alone

the-dump 2021-09-13 04:18:14 Ironic how now that I mentioned it, it didn't happen.
the-dump 2021-09-13 04:19:52 Noted
the-dump 2021-09-13 04:20:04 So don't argue in pcc
the-dump 2021-09-13 04:20:27 <@723940197456281640> I see you're *that*  kind of weeb.
the-dump 2021-09-13 04:20:47 I respect that, but I look down upon it as well.
the-dump 2021-09-13 04:21:07 Accurate
the-dump 2021-09-13 04:21:28 I-
Wait.
the-dump 2021-09-13 04:21:49 Tbh I can't even call myself a weeb, I've only seen a single anime.
the-dump 2021-09-13 04:21:57 *technically I'm a weeblet*

the-dump 2021-09-13 04:22:39 I'm into the lore of things mostly
the-dump 2021-09-13 04:23:11 Hence why I'm obsessed with Rhodes Island LS.
Because so little is known about it.
the-dump 2021-09-13 04:23:38 Note, Rhodes Island Landship is from Arknights. 
Which never had an anime as of yet.
the-dump 2021-09-13 04:23:54 *Arknights anime when*

I might do an Express train tbh.
the-dump 2021-09-22 07:46:07 Even though the loco and power car were built for cargo...
the-dump 2021-09-22 07:46:33 It do look nice with coaches
the-dump 2021-09-22 07:46:39 Eh kinda.
the-dump 2021-09-22 07:47:31 When a container breaks loose from the flatbed,, and bashes the power car.
the-dump 2021-09-22 07:47:43 Actually,  2 came loose.
the-dump 2021-09-22 07:49:12 Alright, I'm just here chillin in a coach, and a while ago. The locomotive caught on fire.
the-dump 2021-09-22 07:49:22 Burns for a bit, and the coupler breaks
the-dump 2021-09-22 07:49:35 So now there's a burning, runaway train..
the-dump 2021-09-22 07:51:34 I would do a chase with it with another loco and power car, but eh..

the-dump 2021-09-27 23:25:40 Not trying to be.
the-dump 2021-09-27 23:27:20 <@251386335883952129> it was nicknamed the Polar Express, but due to copyright, we had to officially name it the Arctic Express

the-dump 2021-09-28 01:22:09 Nah, we use the flatbed for that.
the-dump 2021-09-28 01:22:42 And 6 header locomotives, 4 power cars, and 7 trailing locomotives.
the-dump 2021-09-28 01:24:08 Btw like everything on this train, the hoppers are custom built by me.

the-dump 2021-09-29 02:04:08 The cabin structure is 2 stories high. With the length of the entire cruiser being 23 meters
the-dump 2021-09-29 02:05:09 Oh yeah

the-dump 2021-10-01 00:21:12 Ironic, because that car is a generation 3 racer.
the-dump 2021-10-01 00:21:42 There's a catch tho
the-dump 2021-10-01 00:22:02 And the name probably gives it away

the-dump 2021-10-12 05:14:51 Azur Lane is a shipwreck
the-dump 2021-10-12 05:15:06 I was surprised when I found out that it had lore..
the-dump 2021-10-12 05:15:16 The tiniest amount,  but it's there.

the-dump 2021-10-16 01:20:58 Stormworks
the-dump 2021-10-16 01:21:13 LS Dalet is going to be a land carrier

the-dump 2021-11-18 05:19:06 HMMM YES.
SCIENCE FICTION
the-dump 2021-11-18 05:19:12 TOTALLY
the-dump 2021-11-18 05:19:43 DAL classifies as a harem comedy
the-dump 2021-11-18 05:19:58 Very little sci-fi
the-dump 2021-11-18 05:20:04 Wait. I take that back
the-dump 2021-11-18 05:20:40 
the-dump 2021-11-18 05:20:51 There do be sci fi
the-dump 2021-11-18 05:21:23 
the-dump 2021-11-18 05:21:33 Uhhhhh
the-dump 2021-11-18 05:21:36 .
the-dump 2021-11-18 05:21:41 You don't get it
the-dump 2021-11-18 05:22:00 You *"date"* spirits....
the-dump 2021-11-18 05:22:17 Beings which cause spatial quakes when they enter our world
the-dump 2021-11-18 05:22:44 They're living.
They just become spirits with a sephara crystal
the-dump 2021-11-18 05:22:55 Being a spirit means you get powers.
the-dump 2021-11-18 05:23:41 The date, if successful,  will prevent that.
It "seals" them, so they STAY in our world. In turn not causing spatial quakes.
the-dump 2021-11-18 05:24:28 Interesting anime tbh
the-dump 2021-11-18 05:24:56 Gotta get her to fall for you
the-dump 2021-11-18 05:25:01 Then kiss her
the-dump 2021-11-18 05:25:05 That create the seal
the-dump 2021-11-18 05:25:13 If you dont
the-dump 2021-11-18 05:25:19 And her emotions go unstable
the-dump 2021-11-18 05:25:35 You risk her causing a quake, or her angel summoning
the-dump 2021-11-18 05:25:57 And an angry spirit + her angel isn't good
the-dump 2021-11-18 05:26:50 Bruh
the-dump 2021-11-18 05:26:57 What the hecc
the-dump 2021-11-18 05:27:41 ..
the-dump 2021-11-18 05:27:52 huh?
the-dump 2021-11-18 05:27:56 Weird
the-dump 2021-11-18 05:28:45 An example of a spirit's angel going rogue
the-dump 2021-11-18 05:31:45 Its cheese I swear.
*Teen Titans out of context*
the-dump 2021-11-18 05:32:20 Tbh I wonder if any clips of the original teen titans still exist...
the-dump 2021-11-18 05:32:39 That'd be interesting to see.
the-dump 2021-11-18 05:38:15 In that case
the-dump 2021-11-18 05:38:43 Anime out of context
the-dump 2021-11-18 05:38:59 h
the-dump 2021-11-18 05:39:40 ***SWEET HOME ALABAMA***

the-dump 2021-11-18 05:42:51 *featus deletus*
the-dump 2021-11-18 05:43:08 Or, Yeetus Featus
the-dump 2021-11-18 17:48:34 
the-dump 2021-11-18 17:49:06 Lol
the-dump 2021-11-18 17:51:08 Yez
the-dump 2021-11-18 19:56:20 So
the-dump 2021-11-18 19:56:37 I just had a feel for how 60 fps looks
the-dump 2021-11-18 19:56:48 But god damn, so freaking smoll
the-dump 2021-11-19 15:43:37 
the-dump 2021-11-19 16:21:54 When
the-dump 2021-11-19 16:27:17 Stormworks and space engineers devs be like
the-dump 2021-11-19 16:28:15 Also here is your cursed image of the day
the-dump 2021-11-19 20:51:24 Bit of a weeb rant.
But god damn the first season of Date A Live had crippling depression as far as its intro goes.
This is literally what the first verse looks like.
the-dump 2021-11-19 20:51:39 For comparison,  Here is the one from the third season
the-dump 2021-11-19 20:52:13 *I still gotta do the one for the second season*
the-dump 2021-11-19 20:52:40 Are all anime like this?
Are they always depressed in their first season,?
the-dump 2021-11-19 20:53:29 I mean, I get that japan has a problem with mass depression,  but god damn is it really THAT bad?
the-dump 2021-11-19 21:00:12 No I haven't. 
So it's actually that bad?
the-dump 2021-11-19 21:01:30 Jeez we need to ship a boat load of antidepressants over to japan
the-dump 2021-11-19 21:03:28 Look, I may be considered a weeb. 
But I'm never moving to japan.
If I would move, It'd not be by choice.
the-dump 2021-11-19 21:04:33 Yeah.
Japan has a crippled economy
the-dump 2021-11-19 21:06:58 
the-dump 2021-11-19 21:07:30 Yeah.
*"You're either a success or a disappointment"*
the-dump 2021-11-19 21:08:28 I think so
the-dump 2021-11-19 21:09:13 You know your country is depressed when they have a freaking ***Suicide forest***
the-dump 2021-11-19 21:12:28 Dear god

the-dump 2021-11-23 04:13:17 I would say I'm open for recommendations,but I'm not ready for a commitment yet lmao
the-dump 2021-11-23 04:13:36 Someone said I should watch darling in the franx
the-dump 2021-11-23 04:13:49 I said they can go sh- themselves
the-dump 2021-11-23 04:14:04 A
the-dump 2021-11-23 04:14:13 Someone said I should watch Azur Lane
the-dump 2021-11-23 04:14:33 I watched half of the first episode and said hell to the naw
the-dump 2021-11-23 04:14:37 So
the-dump 2021-11-23 04:14:38 Much
the-dump 2021-11-23 04:14:42 Upskirting
the-dump 2021-11-23 04:15:19 Although,  I may have a saving grace?
the-dump 2021-11-23 04:15:31 Depends on how shit this one is
the-dump 2021-11-23 04:15:50 Wonder how they would do the landships..
the-dump 2021-11-23 04:16:09 Yes
the-dump 2021-11-23 04:16:15 Arknights has landships
the-dump 2021-11-23 04:16:50 ......

the-dump 2021-11-23 04:17:57 Like they did with Azur Lane
the-dump 2021-11-23 04:18:03 Freaking cringe
the-dump 2021-11-23 04:18:15 I now have a fear of upskirting thanks to Azur Lane
the-dump 2021-11-23 04:18:20 Yay what fun
the-dump 2021-11-23 04:18:54 I was never into it anyways.
the-dump 2021-11-23 04:19:13 Because some weeb decided they wanted to date world war era battleships
the-dump 2021-11-23 04:19:28 Uh what the hell?
the-dump 2021-11-23 04:19:48 Bismarck is a girl in AL canon

the-dump 2021-11-23 04:21:17 Isn't that compared to Arknights sometimes?
the-dump 2021-11-23 04:21:38 Reject Azur Lane.
Embrace Arknights lore.
the-dump 2021-11-23 04:21:57 Tbh I was shocked when I found out that Azur Lane actually has lore
the-dump 2021-11-23 04:23:06 Anyways.
If this doesn't at least make an appearance in the Arknights anime adaptation. 
Ima riot

the-dump 2021-11-23 04:26:55 Hence why I'm obsessed with the Arknights landships
the-dump 2021-11-23 04:27:17 Or, the Combat Realizers from Date A Live.
the-dump 2021-11-23 04:28:09 Or this
the-dump 2021-11-23 04:28:24 The only anime I've seen.
the-dump 2021-11-23 04:28:46 It's an anime.

the-dump 2021-12-23 17:42:48 
the-dump 2021-12-23 17:43:53 Nah
the-dump 2021-12-23 17:44:25 We built a landship to move yours, and even though we used reinforced titanium suspension,  she still broke the tracks
the-dump 2021-12-23 17:44:45 So we just settled on an aircraft carrier landship instead
the-dump 2021-12-23 17:45:08 *,shots fired right back at ya buckaroo*
the-dump 2021-12-25 07:14:48 New bow I built for my newest ship.

the-dump 2021-12-25 15:22:27 
the-dump 2021-12-25 15:23:05 It's actually a drill.
the-dump 2021-12-25 15:23:27 No
the-dump 2021-12-31 17:08:00 Can someone give me an opinion on this nameplate? It's supposed to say HTILS Aura.
the-dump 2021-12-31 17:08:25 it's a miniture nameplate that's inside the landship's bridge
the-dump 2021-12-31 17:11:10 so... does that mean it's bad?
the-dump 2021-12-31 17:11:51 does that mean it's bad?
the-dump 2021-12-31 17:12:21 hmmmm
the-dump 2021-12-31 17:12:41 hey <@!707953054489509978> may I ask ya something?
the-dump 2021-12-31 17:13:07 a
the-dump 2021-12-31 17:13:26 How would you rate this nameplate?
It's supposed to say HTILS Aura
the-dump 2021-12-31 17:13:42 ;-;
the-dump 2021-12-31 17:13:49 how might I improve it?
the-dump 2021-12-31 17:14:06 keep in mind that this is a small nameplate that goes in the bridge
the-dump 2021-12-31 17:14:13 so I really can't do a lot of detail
the-dump 2021-12-31 17:14:29 no, I just said why I cannot do that.
the-dump 2021-12-31 17:14:57 also the font is supposed to be custom, but it's difficult to do that with the small amount I have on that small nameplate
the-dump 2021-12-31 17:15:25 1x5 block nameplate.
I have very little room to do detail
the-dump 2021-12-31 17:15:50 
the-dump 2021-12-31 17:15:58 that's the boarders of the paint blocks
the-dump 2021-12-31 17:16:36 also..
the-dump 2021-12-31 17:16:51 repeat the landship's name twice <:trollface:775024642104229898>
the-dump 2021-12-31 17:17:00 *the name is Aura*

the-dump 2022-02-02 13:53:07 *The dry wind passes through (Dead or alive)
The city of forlorn people
My eyes desperate for the light (Dead or alive)
Could only see~ the despair~

My mouth which screams are left unheard~
Seal it with your hand that ^I've been looking for^

In a world where everything is destroyed
I don't know the reason why, I'm still
Scared of the gentleness that you touched me with

Are you gonna be the one
Who will fill the all emptiness ^inside of my heart?~^*
the-dump 2022-02-02 13:53:53 *My pain that I'm suffering in silence~ (Dead or alive)
Has come up once~ again~
After this war is over ~(Dead or alive)
Will despair be the only thing that remains?~

My mind that nobody has ever cured
Clear it with your hand that I took hold of

In a world that everybody has rejected
I still can't find the way to
Keep being in it without having to hurt someone

Are you gonna be the one
Who will accept this feeling that will fade, without a place?
Please tell me, date a live...

Can't hold back~ (Resolution and desolation)
My lingering doubts~ (I wander alone)
A clash of conflicting views on justice~

Growing expectations~ (But truthfully~)
I just want to believe, if change is possible, ^Ohhh^

In a world where all is lost
I'm starting to feel that I've found something
From that hand that's reaching out to me

Faintly, bit by bit
This unclear feeling~
Is starting to affirm itself more

Are you gonna be the one
Who will change the rumb-ling course of my heart?~*

the-dump 2022-02-02 13:55:35 ||Fate, everything is necessary?
A meeting (meeting) like being attracted to each other, a connecting story.

Hey, if you can't understand
The pounding in this chest (up to you) ,
Just let it fall like this.

Now choose, let's begin the thrilling date.

I'll never give up these feelings that awaken
As we talk, as we touch, as we laugh.
This is my first time being so honest,
Because I met you and want to be by your side.
I want to believe, Date a Live

Fake, just a misunderstanding?
Fading vertigo (vertigo) , when you feel it it's the end.

Hey, nothing can stop
These rampaging feelings
Once they melt. (it's too late)
Now choose, let us begin the dangerous date
As I Struggle, frustratingly, painfully,
This wish grows, even if it should never
come true.
Because | want to protect
The feelings that saved me, touching your
kind lips.
Let me believe Date a Live.
Like | don't even know how to doubt
(purifying, these feelings with nowhere to go)

I end up accepting everything. (can I look
forward to it?)
The overly-kind you, (though it's just
complicated)
| want to be by your side (supporting you)
Always.
There's no way that there's a right answer
To the intersecting happiness and sadness.
ln this word that doesn't know anything,
just one
Strong, definite thought.
I'll never give up these feelings that awaken
As we talk, as we touch, as we laugh.
This is my first time being so honest,
Because I met you and want to be by your
side
| want to believe Date a Live||

the-dump 2022-02-02 14:16:02 ||This lightly fading, contours, it's almost like, our focus points unify~

The anxiety and pain, that I have kept hidden for all this time, is all entrusted in-to you~
Without hesitation I can go when I'm with you, I can be dedicated when I'm with you
I will be by your side at any time, I know that I can feel it. ^Date A Live^

You kissed me so sweetly once again, at the moment I gently closed my eyes
A line of sight intersecting somewhere, I can never go back to before!

Memories that are just so similar, but different.. I swear, on this sketched scenery
I start to notice the present that's here right now and then, the different future

We meet each other so many times, oh in this constantly revolving world. So Let's begin our ^Date!^

It's like this somewhat weird feeling, that is gently flowing through myself
Don't take these, feelings that look like they'd overflow only upon yourself~
I can overcome if it's with you, I'll show you just because it's you

The real truth,(somewhere), `that I know before touching`. ^Date A Live!^

It lightly changed color once again, the moment we finally touched each other's heart.
The truth goes missing somewhere, did you know, even before we touched?

I don't want to lose this memory. One day, I swear a budded determination
I can't express it well in words but it's a ^certain thing^!

I won't ever give up your warmth, no not in a thousand years ^ So Let's begin our Date^

I'm starting in the past, here only exists now, and this future just might change.
Whatever despair, whatever hope, If only I could be oh just like you who gently smiles~

More than now, for a moment, there can be a world without sorrow..
Even if the irreplaceable wounds heal, don't you ever let these connected hands be ^separated^
…
I just want to protect you who is more dear than anybody else. I just wanna feel alive and ^always by your siiiide^

You kissed me so sweetly once again, at the moment I gently closed my eyes
Somewhere our glances crossed, and from there, we never got to ^return back from before!^

They resemble but they're different memories. I swear, on this sketched out scenery
I start to notice the present that's here right now, and then the changing future~

We meet eachother so many times, oh in this constantly revolving world,  so there's one thing left to do now, ^let's begin our Daaaate~^||

the-dump 2022-02-07 15:42:42 What if I use one that already did?
the-dump 2022-02-07 15:42:57 then explain how most laptops have them.
the-dump 2022-02-07 15:43:14 HP Probook 650s G1.

the-dump 2022-02-07 15:44:47 besides, I just want an extra drive that'd mainly be used for games and such, so i can get some load off of the main system drive
the-dump 2022-02-07 15:44:55 and don't say "oh just get an external"
the-dump 2022-02-07 15:45:17 ain't goanna get anywhere not taking risks

the-dump 2022-02-07 15:54:52 haha CO2 poisoning go brrr
the-dump 2022-02-07 15:55:15 it's simple
the-dump 2022-02-07 15:55:27 plop the laptop on top of dry ice, with the case off
the-dump 2022-02-07 15:55:49 fucking laws of thermodynamics, always ruining the fun
the-dump 2022-02-07 15:56:13 oh, so it will turn into my life?
the-dump 2022-02-07 15:56:52 I'm still finding a way to expand storage, more permanetly
the-dump 2022-02-07 15:57:28 whether it be bolting on an external HDD, or installing another drive permanetly into it
the-dump 2022-02-07 15:57:35 I did you baka
the-dump 2022-02-07 15:57:42 went from 4 gb to 12 gb
the-dump 2022-02-07 15:57:50 it has a max cap of 16 gb
the-dump 2022-02-07 15:58:13 why
the-dump 2022-02-07 15:58:23 hehe laptop BBQ
the-dump 2022-02-07 15:59:06 ~~forbidden slushee~~
the-dump 2022-02-07 15:59:20 okay fine, so what do ya'll think I should do?
the-dump 2022-02-07 15:59:24 hmm?
the-dump 2022-02-07 15:59:37 Other than externals, what option do I have?
the-dump 2022-02-07 15:59:46 hmm?
the-dump 2022-02-07 15:59:59 already did
the-dump 2022-02-07 16:00:02 but at modern day
the-dump 2022-02-07 16:00:06 200 GB ain't shit
the-dump 2022-02-07 16:00:20 all those are on an external drive
the-dump 2022-02-07 16:01:11 I'm aware
the-dump 2022-02-07 16:01:25 I still play them from time to time
the-dump 2022-02-07 16:01:41 which is why I have them on an external
the-dump 2022-02-07 16:02:09 s t e a m
the-dump 2022-02-07 16:03:19 uhhhh
the-dump 2022-02-07 16:03:24 damn...
the-dump 2022-02-07 16:03:33 15 GB of workshop content
the-dump 2022-02-07 16:03:40 god damn past me, wtf?
the-dump 2022-02-07 16:04:06 is bulky
the-dump 2022-02-07 16:04:08 yes Ik
the-dump 2022-02-07 16:04:15 I was goanna put it on the external
the-dump 2022-02-07 16:04:19 but steam had a stroke
the-dump 2022-02-07 16:05:13 why not just use the current one?
the-dump 2022-02-07 16:05:34 I don't keep photos on my pc
the-dump 2022-02-07 16:05:54 I might invest in Megasync
the-dump 2022-02-07 16:06:02 I keep those on onedrive
the-dump 2022-02-07 16:06:18 why not just.. E x t e n d
the-dump 2022-02-07 16:07:04 make the case contour to the upgrade
the-dump 2022-02-07 16:07:12 hehe buzz saw go brrr
the-dump 2022-02-07 16:07:20 nice joke
the-dump 2022-02-07 16:07:48 bold of you to assume I have a stable income
the-dump 2022-02-07 16:08:15 anyway
the-dump 2022-02-07 16:08:29 Ima either invest in hard upgrades, or in a cloud service
the-dump 2022-02-07 16:08:41 I hear Mega has quite a deal with storage
the-dump 2022-02-07 16:10:01 **ngl this ain't that bad**
the-dump 2022-02-07 16:10:07 yep
the-dump 2022-02-07 16:10:26 16 TB is something a laptop user can only dream of
the-dump 2022-02-07 16:10:46 I'm saying buying an entire new unit
the-dump 2022-02-07 16:10:52 wait....
the-dump 2022-02-07 16:10:57 I'm a dumbass
the-dump 2022-02-07 16:11:22 Bold of you to assume I can program
the-dump 2022-02-07 16:11:55 I have a hard drive from a laptop I dismantled because It failed on me. I might just hook it up and use it as another external or some crap
the-dump 2022-02-07 16:13:13 Anyway would a network drive be any good?
the-dump 2022-02-07 16:13:20 like, at all?
the-dump 2022-02-07 16:13:31 for example, to have a game stored on?
the-dump 2022-02-07 16:13:56 me wanting to upgrade
the-dump 2022-02-07 16:14:03 trashy SSD moment
the-dump 2022-02-07 16:14:18 laptop....
the-dump 2022-02-07 16:14:27 I want a more... *perminant* solution
the-dump 2022-02-07 16:14:39 one that... *can't be removed*
the-dump 2022-02-07 16:15:02 Ayo I just realized
the-dump 2022-02-07 16:15:23 My laptop has like at least 60% of its case taken by the disk drive
the-dump 2022-02-07 16:15:37 I was planning to remove it anyway
the-dump 2022-02-07 16:15:44 why not put the hard drive in there?
the-dump 2022-02-07 16:16:00 I mean, if it fits, it fits
the-dump 2022-02-07 16:16:18 disk drives typically just, slide out, with laptops
the-dump 2022-02-07 16:16:36 yes because it opens inside my bag and gives me mini heart attacks
the-dump 2022-02-07 16:18:14 here's the neat part. ***I'm not***
the-dump 2022-02-07 16:18:53 yeah.. I'm a professional....
the-dump 2022-02-07 16:18:58 ***Professional Idiot***
the-dump 2022-02-07 16:58:11 wtf is up with this?
the-dump 2022-02-07 16:58:42 god damnit microsoft I get youw anna force people to use windows 11, but really? ***Really***
the-dump 2022-02-07 16:58:57 fucking windows system files that's what
the-dump 2022-02-07 16:59:25 Smoll, trashy SSD that has almost nothing in regards to storage
the-dump 2022-02-07 16:59:35 237GB is almost nothing at modern day
the-dump 2022-02-07 16:59:52 and considering winsystem takes like, almost 50 gigs
the-dump 2022-02-07 17:00:00 and I can't do shit about it
the-dump 2022-02-07 17:03:17 almost tempted to compress
the-dump 2022-02-07 17:04:35 guys
the-dump 2022-02-07 17:04:39 I found the bastard
the-dump 2022-02-07 17:05:05 and it's still going
the-dump 2022-02-07 17:05:15 what happens if I compress it?
the-dump 2022-02-07 17:08:10 fun fact
the-dump 2022-02-07 17:08:18 OS won't let you delet sys32
the-dump 2022-02-07 17:08:54 I got the bastard
the-dump 2022-02-07 17:10:24 shit
the-dump 2022-02-07 17:10:34 "Do not compress the windows root directory"
the-dump 2022-02-07 17:10:45 ***Well shit***
the-dump 2022-02-07 18:08:30 I've already handled that..
the-dump 2022-02-07 18:08:43 and uh
the-dump 2022-02-07 18:09:00 
the-dump 2022-02-07 18:09:28 btw gmod takes up like, 14 gigs...
the-dump 2022-02-07 18:09:46 
the-dump 2022-02-07 18:09:52 i'm aware
the-dump 2022-02-07 18:10:36 I already been using that
the-dump 2022-02-07 20:49:41 okay so
the-dump 2022-02-07 20:49:44 I found a cloud service
the-dump 2022-02-07 20:49:51 that gives 1 Terrabyte free
the-dump 2022-02-07 20:49:57 1024 GB
the-dump 2022-02-07 20:49:59 free
the-dump 2022-02-07 20:50:02 no catch.
the-dump 2022-02-07 20:50:06 like, god damn
the-dump 2022-02-07 20:51:54 I'm not joking
the-dump 2022-02-07 20:52:10 I can legit send you a link to it
the-dump 2022-02-07 20:52:23 so, that, and the fact you can use alts
the-dump 2022-02-07 20:52:50 you can probably get up to 30TB *depending on how determined you are* of storage free
the-dump 2022-02-07 20:53:18 it isn't google drive
the-dump 2022-02-07 20:54:04 only bad part is...
the-dump 2022-02-07 20:54:19 it doesn't integrate as a drive.... you have to use the app
the-dump 2022-02-07 20:54:43 so, notice how google drive will integrate itself...
the-dump 2022-02-07 20:55:01 This one, terrabox. Doesn't
the-dump 2022-02-07 20:56:16 'anyway I'm tempted to create 50 gmail accounts to exploit the desktop app for google drive's multiple account feature
the-dump 2022-02-07 20:56:53 hehe
the-dump 2022-02-08 02:54:45 *"We're still gonna keep going forward"
Graphite/diamond
Without looking back*
the-dump 2022-02-08 02:56:33 Yep
the-dump 2022-02-08 02:57:41 What do I believe in.
My chest feels like it's about to burst and now once again, I'm all alone to face this world.
Why should I believe in, the pain is building up into layers just to shackle me down, but there's no time to cry right now...
the-dump 2022-02-08 02:57:52 <@698587744842022983> guess that one
the-dump 2022-02-08 02:58:18 Shdgdvnakargbd
the-dump 2022-02-08 02:58:33 Oh lol
the-dump 2022-02-08 02:58:42 Untitled world, Reona
the-dump 2022-02-08 02:59:32 The dry wind passes through (Dead or alive)
The city of forlorn people
My eyes desperate for the light (Dead or alive)
Could only see~ the despair~
My mouth which screams are left unheard~
Seal it with your hand that ^I've been looking for^
In a world where everything is destroyed
I don't know the reason why, I'm still
Scared of the gentleness that you touched me with
the-dump 2022-02-08 03:00:13 Know that one?
the-dump 2022-02-08 03:00:56 Someone's goanna be using google sound search lol
the-dump 2022-02-08 03:02:38 
the-dump 2022-02-08 03:03:04 
the-dump 2022-02-08 03:03:11 E
the-dump 2022-02-08 03:04:45 Hmmm.
Maybe
the-dump 2022-02-08 03:04:59 Ë
the-dump 2022-02-08 06:30:58 Gotta love when pcc roasts the fuck outta of shredder users
the-dump 2022-02-08 06:31:16 That's the one thing that keeps my faith in pcc
the-dump 2022-02-08 06:31:38 Is the fact that most of it, is cultured people.
the-dump 2022-02-08 06:33:04 How it feels making custom suspension
the-dump 2022-02-08 06:33:42 Yeah I built that, and it's the best one i built....
Yet, i have no use for it.
😕
the-dump 2022-02-08 06:34:12 I'm outta ideas for landships..
the-dump 2022-02-08 06:34:27 And my Explorer class bus is too small to support it
the-dump 2022-02-08 06:34:33 Stormworks
the-dump 2022-02-08 06:35:03 As of last week, it now has legit storms
the-dump 2022-02-08 06:35:41 Stormworks is basically the chad version of plane crazy,  but twice as laggy
the-dump 2022-02-08 06:36:10 Kuso baka<@159985870458322944>
the-dump 2022-02-08 06:36:26 Oh so I can cuss you out in Japanese
the-dump 2022-02-08 06:36:31 But not english
the-dump 2022-02-08 06:36:36 I see how it is
the-dump 2022-02-08 06:37:24 Anyway as I was saying
the-dump 2022-02-08 06:37:44 The reason it be so laggy is because the lead dev can't lead a dev team for crap.
the-dump 2022-02-08 06:38:07 He has affectionately been nicknamed deltard by the game's community
the-dump 2022-02-08 06:38:28 *his actual name is deltars*
the-dump 2022-02-08 06:39:17 
the-dump 2022-02-08 06:40:47 Goddamn... I just realized
the-dump 2022-02-08 06:41:06 It's been legit ages since I've built a landship in stormworks
the-dump 2022-02-08 06:41:44 Yet, here I am making parts to build a mega one...
the-dump 2022-02-08 06:50:22 I'm not building that
the-dump 2022-02-08 06:51:00 Still not building it
the-dump 2022-02-08 06:51:09 Can't convince me
the-dump 2022-02-08 06:51:26 I'm sticking to my roots of Arknights landships
the-dump 2022-02-08 06:51:50 Well...
I do custom ones but they're heavily inspired by the ones in Arknights
the-dump 2022-02-08 06:52:05 Specifically the Rhodes Island land cruiser
the-dump 2022-02-08 06:52:31 As, that's sadly the only one that has concept art.
the-dump 2022-02-08 06:52:49 I hope that will change with Prelude to Dawn
the-dump 2022-02-08 06:53:17 Anyway...
Ima send a picture of my newest landship. If I can find it, it's been ages.
the-dump 2022-02-08 06:54:05 Two newest ones..
LS Titan and LS Dalet
the-dump 2022-02-08 06:54:33 Dalet is the newest one, and it's a 3 story land carrier with an internal hangar
the-dump 2022-02-08 06:54:44 Titan is a 2 story landship interceptor
the-dump 2022-02-08 06:55:01 Alot faster than Dalet, however the armor on it is VERY light
the-dump 2022-02-08 06:55:19 I did build one in plane crazy, wanna see?
the-dump 2022-02-08 06:55:34 Ight gimme a sec
the-dump 2022-02-08 06:56:05 A bit outdated, but still about the same.
the-dump 2022-02-08 06:56:35 She was completely rebuilt for plane crazy 2
the-dump 2022-02-08 06:56:57 
the-dump 2022-02-08 06:57:12 Hehe
the-dump 2022-02-08 06:58:37 Anyways...
I would build more.. but uhh
the-dump 2022-02-08 06:58:43 I've kinda got landship burnout
the-dump 2022-02-08 06:59:05 So currently...
I've been working on a bus.
the-dump 2022-02-08 06:59:12 
the-dump 2022-02-08 06:59:30 Le storm chaser
the-dump 2022-02-08 07:00:04 It did its purpose for storm chasing, although with legit all tornados being the same, there's no point in chasing them.
the-dump 2022-02-08 07:00:27 However, I'm working on converting it to a Terrain Explorer
the-dump 2022-02-08 07:00:52 Meaning it could climb mountains and shit like that
the-dump 2022-02-08 07:01:28 *I mean, the chaser can do that already,  but it's kinda weird bc of the mechanisms for the storm probe*
the-dump 2022-02-08 07:01:50 Uh
the-dump 2022-02-08 07:02:01 And here I thought what I did was cursed
the-dump 2022-02-08 07:02:44 Hehe nyoom
the-dump 2022-02-08 07:03:10 I have yet to do a photoshoot of the modern version
the-dump 2022-02-08 07:03:34 .....
the-dump 2022-02-08 07:03:52 I will fite you with a landship, and run you over
the-dump 2022-02-08 07:04:13 Or would you prefer to be smacked by a tornado probe?
the-dump 2022-02-08 07:04:37 Bet
the-dump 2022-02-08 07:04:48 You can if there are no witnesses
the-dump 2022-02-08 07:05:16 Le controls
the-dump 2022-02-08 07:05:35 Exactly
the-dump 2022-02-08 07:05:54 Nah. Just smack the pregnant person with their own featus...
*wait*
the-dump 2022-02-08 07:06:14 Featus deleatus
the-dump 2022-02-08 07:06:54 
the-dump 2022-02-08 07:10:02 Hehe

the-dump 2022-02-20 02:23:08 renamed my landship from Land-Cruiser to Terrain Explorer
the-dump 2022-02-20 02:23:30 So I don't have to deal with nerds callling it a giant tank that was named after a rodent

the-dump 2022-02-22 13:02:14 Who else remembers *Shake it Up* ?
the-dump 2022-02-22 13:03:30 Accurate
the-dump 2022-02-22 13:06:50 Yes
the-dump 2022-02-22 13:07:02 Such as letting someone choose their gender
the-dump 2022-02-22 13:07:11 That's for biology to decide
the-dump 2022-02-22 13:07:38 Exactly
the-dump 2022-02-22 13:07:58 Although, gender swap surgery exists....
So there's that
the-dump 2022-02-22 13:09:34 Yeah
the-dump 2022-02-22 13:09:40 Some people need to just cope
the-dump 2022-02-22 13:09:58 Anyone?
the-dump 2022-02-22 13:10:28 Scroll up
the-dump 2022-02-22 13:12:41 Physically, not really
the-dump 2022-02-22 13:13:21 This is what I was referring to
the-dump 2022-02-22 13:14:13 Dun fact.
There is actually only 3 genders,  eith the 3rd one being exceptionally rare
the-dump 2022-02-22 13:14:59 Male, Female, and Nonbinary. 
This is caused by a rare mutation causing the child to have both female, and male reproductive organs, which also causes them to become infertile.
the-dump 2022-02-22 13:15:48 It's called science
the-dump 2022-02-22 13:53:21 no, the person themselves are infertle, meaning they literally cannot *'do the deed'* or else their hormones would cause their body ho have a stroke
the-dump 2022-02-22 13:55:47 I'm just saying, biologically non bianary people are the 'inspiratio' beinind this whole mess, so they can promptly go screw themselves... 

*w a i t, I didn't mean it like that*
the-dump 2022-02-22 13:57:39 okay <@!192861290677534722> so, how many genders are there?
the-dump 2022-02-22 13:57:42 <:trol:916591571963629608>
the-dump 2022-02-22 13:58:24 2
the-dump 2022-02-22 13:58:40 according to science, only 2 1/2 genders exist
the-dump 2022-02-22 13:58:54 Science never lies
the-dump 2022-02-22 13:59:01 nor does statistics
the-dump 2022-02-22 13:59:25 *yes*
the-dump 2022-02-22 13:59:42 but still, all these other 34 genders can <a:SHUT:874923284850966528>
the-dump 2022-02-22 14:00:07 oh so nonbianary is genderless now?
the-dump 2022-02-22 14:00:13 seems legit
the-dump 2022-02-22 14:00:42 Anyway, am I just old, or does **anyone** else here remember the old disney shows? Like Shake it Up, or ANT farm, or JEssie
the-dump 2022-02-22 14:12:30 *bring the lights up, bust the doors down, dust yourself off, Shake it Up, Shake it Up!*
the-dump 2022-02-22 17:26:33 *The show may be trash, but the intros can be fire.*

the-dump 2022-02-25 03:44:54 This exists

the-dump 2022-03-01 06:00:13 What will remain after this world war?
Will it just be despair, pain and disrepair?
Or will it be a depression, leaving an impression on generations to come?
The time to find out isn't very far, with the tensions rising, nuclear warfare is bound.
the-dump 2022-03-01 06:03:26 So
the-dump 2022-03-01 06:03:34 Pain and disrepair?
the-dump 2022-03-01 06:04:02 And economic depression, leaving impressions on our grandchildren for generations?
the-dump 2022-03-01 06:04:20 Shut
the-dump 2022-03-01 06:04:51 The fact I basically did a poem instead of saying
*After this war is over,  will despair be all that remains*
the-dump 2022-03-01 06:08:26 I was just doing a poem
the-dump 2022-03-01 06:08:40 Instead of quoting anime lyrics to bring the topic up
the-dump 2022-03-01 06:08:54 The bot
the-dump 2022-03-01 06:09:00 Has a mind of its own

the-dump 2022-03-01 06:12:01 <@705345850137640960>
the-dump 2022-03-01 06:12:20 You've been struck by
Plane-Bus
the-dump 2022-03-01 06:12:46 *AKA A bus with jet wings slapped on*
the-dump 2022-03-01 06:13:17 Mexican burrito
the-dump 2022-03-01 15:08:47 Damn right
the-dump 2022-03-01 15:09:13 Wait, that actually aired?
the-dump 2022-03-01 15:18:37 Stormworks is a better version of plane crazy, while being more broken at the same time.
the-dump 2022-03-01 15:19:43 Plane crazy is more stable than SW, bu it has less features than SW.
the-dump 2022-03-01 15:20:36 True..
the-dump 2022-03-01 15:20:43 Although each game has its advantages
the-dump 2022-03-01 15:20:47 For example
the-dump 2022-03-01 15:20:59 Stormworks has copy paste, multi build,  and logic
the-dump 2022-03-01 15:21:21 Plane crazy has pvp,simple mechanics, and runs more stable *most of the time*
the-dump 2022-03-01 15:21:55 While stormworks has pvp mechanics, the weapons are modular and would be more difficult to understand than the ones in plane crazy
the-dump 2022-03-01 15:23:32 It all comes down to preference
the-dump 2022-03-01 15:23:45 Those who prefer more simpler mechanics would go to plane crazy
the-dump 2022-03-01 15:24:02 Those who want full control, and more advan6building would go to stormworks
the-dump 2022-03-01 15:24:17 Myself personally,  I prefer both
the-dump 2022-03-01 15:24:44 Although I prefer the building style of stormworks over plane crazy
the-dump 2022-03-01 15:24:48 Mainly because
the-dump 2022-03-01 15:24:54 It has multi place
the-dump 2022-03-01 15:25:06 U can make a big wall with one clicc
the-dump 2022-03-01 15:25:20 
the-dump 2022-03-01 15:25:32 Lol
the-dump 2022-03-01 15:25:42 I actually had plans for that chassis
the-dump 2022-03-01 15:25:49 But now it's just...
the-dump 2022-03-01 15:25:54 No plans.
the-dump 2022-03-01 15:25:57 Yes
the-dump 2022-03-01 15:26:29 It was going to be the base frame for 3 modular landships, that would be capablr of docking together to create a mega landship
the-dump 2022-03-01 20:31:30 Taht is only because I was testing the chassis, there were no engines yet
the-dump 2022-03-01 20:31:50 Actually to increase surface area, but I guess top speed works too
the-dump 2022-03-01 23:19:09 Treads have no collisions, therefore why I added the wheels

the-dump 2022-03-06 04:21:08 Non binary,  in which either none, or one of the reproductive organs will be functional. 
It is impossible for the human body to have both organs still functional, as it's only designed to handle one, and the hormones from both at the same time would cause mental failure.
the-dump 2022-03-06 04:21:38 Estrogen, is very strong as a hormone
the-dump 2022-03-06 04:21:43 So is testosterone
the-dump 2022-03-06 04:22:02 If they're in equal amounts in an individual,  that wouldn't end well
the-dump 2022-03-06 04:22:11 I just freaking said what would happen
the-dump 2022-03-06 04:22:25 No
the-dump 2022-03-06 04:22:32 I literally just said what would happen
the-dump 2022-03-06 04:23:02 That's not how that works...
the-dump 2022-03-06 04:23:12 No..
the-dump 2022-03-06 04:23:22 Literally said that's not how it works
the-dump 2022-03-06 04:23:50 Humanity needs to stop screwing with genetics
the-dump 2022-03-06 04:24:05 Smoke

the-dump 2022-03-06 04:25:17 You can't tell me, corona is natural
the-dump 2022-03-06 04:25:28 It's literally showing all signs of being artificial
the-dump 2022-03-06 04:25:48 If it was natural...
Explain how it evolved at least 10 times already?
the-dump 2022-03-06 04:25:52 That ain't natural
the-dump 2022-03-06 04:26:04 In 2 years?
the-dump 2022-03-06 04:26:09 10 strands come out?
the-dump 2022-03-06 04:26:26 So that's like, 5 evolutions per year
the-dump 2022-03-06 04:26:30 That ain't natural
the-dump 2022-03-06 04:26:34 And if it is
the-dump 2022-03-06 04:26:37 We're screwed
the-dump 2022-03-06 04:27:16 When
the-dump 2022-03-06 04:27:49 I'd imagine it was the Korea, and they sent it to china
the-dump 2022-03-06 04:27:55 Specifically,  North Korea
the-dump 2022-03-06 04:28:11 The fatty Kim there would be the person to do that anyways
the-dump 2022-03-06 04:28:41 
the-dump 2022-03-06 04:29:12 Corona ain't no accident.

Last weekend I went over to her house...
I had planned for us to watch either Up or WALL-E
the-dump 2022-04-06 06:36:32 But, disney pulled all their films from all streaming services

the-dump 2022-04-06 06:41:43 At this point

the-dump 2022-04-06 06:53:49 But.
Both of us are hyped

the-dump 2022-04-06 07:05:55 Do you realize how few girls let you cuddle?
the-dump 2022-04-06 07:06:24 Also.

I'm trying to provoke them anyways
the-dump 2022-04-06 07:07:27 I have a big kiss planned...
the-dump 2022-04-06 07:07:48 So.
At the end of season 3, there's a scene of a kiss that's REALLY exaggerated
the-dump 2022-04-06 07:07:57 From there, I kiss her
the-dump 2022-04-06 07:08:07 Potentially..
the-dump 2022-04-06 07:08:19 Lips to lips 😳
the-dump 2022-04-06 07:08:31 Meh

the-dump 2022-04-06 07:15:41 Anyway
the-dump 2022-04-06 07:15:46 The key to this
the-dump 2022-04-06 07:15:53 Is to not be horni..
the-dump 2022-04-06 07:16:05 nah don't have to

the-dump 2022-04-06 20:23:53 My gf lets me cuddle with her.
the-dump 2022-04-06 20:23:59 That's what that was

the-dump 2022-04-06 22:01:41 I mean, that's different. But that's nice.

the-dump 2022-04-06 22:05:19 That one statement was a lie
the-dump 2022-04-06 22:05:36 Everything else however, is truth
the-dump 2022-04-06 22:05:46 You have a point
the-dump 2022-04-06 22:06:04 That makes no sense
the-dump 2022-04-06 22:06:40

the-dump 2022-04-27 01:06:32 actually, while survivalcraft came out after minecraft, it can be argued that SC2 is better than Minecraft
the-dump 2022-04-27 01:06:48 Each has advantages over the other
the-dump 2022-04-27 01:13:14 yeah. they ported to windows 10
the-dump 2022-04-27 01:18:40 I never encountered any whales

So a certain social media app has found one of my long lost friends that I've been out of contact with since he switched schools in the 5th grade. *(we're both in high school now)* should I reestablish contact?
the-dump 2022-04-30 05:00:11 Or, should I just let the old times die out?
the-dump 2022-04-30 05:22:17 Advice taken
the-dump 2022-04-30 05:22:49 I shall attempt recommunication in the morning
the-dump 2022-04-30 05:46:43 Fuck no
the-dump 2022-04-30 05:47:16 If anything I'm going to send him 2 pictures.  One of chicken noodle soup, and another of a loaf of bread
the-dump 2022-04-30 05:47:33 When we were younger, we had a joke regarding that
the-dump 2022-04-30 05:50:25 If he remembers this, I shall attempt reconnection
the-dump 2022-04-30 05:50:47 If not, I'll try a few more measures... if that fails I'll bid him well and depart
the-dump 2022-04-30 05:53:55 Heh

the-dump 2022-05-04 05:11:45 Turns out it wasn't anything near what I thought
the-dump 2022-05-04 05:12:25 Turns out, she sensed something was off, and told her parents because she was worried about me. Her parents told mine. And now I'm getting the help I was too scared to ask for
the-dump 2022-05-04 05:12:58 Buuuut, sadly I can't talk to them for a while... until my mental state improves
the-dump 2022-05-04 05:13:04 Shit
the-dump 2022-05-04 05:14:31 Ehhh nah
the-dump 2022-05-04 05:14:52 Hmm

the-dump 2022-05-04 05:16:27 Go ahead
the-dump 2022-05-04 05:17:04 
the-dump 2022-05-04 05:17:55 
the-dump 2022-05-04 05:19:04 
the-dump 2022-05-04 05:19:55 Anyway
the-dump 2022-05-04 06:32:49 H
the-dump 2022-05-04 06:33:16 
the-dump 2022-05-04 06:34:13 Shit
the-dump 2022-05-04 06:34:40 
the-dump 2022-05-04 06:35:09 ...
the-dump 2022-05-04 06:35:13 Shit
the-dump 2022-05-04 06:35:24 Especially since he's younger
the-dump 2022-05-04 06:35:26 Fuck
the-dump 2022-05-04 06:35:29 You're right
the-dump 2022-05-04 06:35:40 No.
the-dump 2022-05-04 06:35:47 He plays minecraft actually
the-dump 2022-05-04 06:35:58 I taught him a few tricks
the-dump 2022-05-04 06:36:18 Well
the-dump 2022-05-04 06:36:40 Currently I'm not allowed anywhere near my girlfriend or her family 😔
the-dump 2022-05-04 06:36:55 Or, quite frankly.. out of my house
the-dump 2022-05-04 06:37:29 No,she knew something was up as my anxiety was spinning out of control and I was going borderline suicidal
the-dump 2022-05-04 06:38:09 So, her parents want us apart until my emotional state stabilize
the-dump 2022-05-04 06:38:30 I'm on anxiety meds now
the-dump 2022-05-04 06:38:42 Had a massive breakdown last night..
the-dump 2022-05-04 06:39:12 Thinking that her parents were turning her against me,that she was going to break up with me..
the-dump 2022-05-04 06:39:35 As it turns out.. her parents are genuinely worried about me..
the-dump 2022-05-04 06:39:45 I tell you,first impressions ARE everything
the-dump 2022-05-04 06:40:19 So anyway...
the-dump 2022-05-04 06:40:28 Since I lost myself over text
the-dump 2022-05-04 06:40:40 We both can't text eachother for the time being
the-dump 2022-05-04 06:40:54 Let things "cool down"
the-dump 2022-05-04 06:41:37 I'm told that I shouldn't talk to her even if I see her when I go back to school....
the-dump 2022-05-04 06:41:52 I'm almost convinced it's a restraining order ;-;
the-dump 2022-05-04 06:42:18 But, no legal evidence of one
the-dump 2022-05-04 06:42:44 Yes I'm aware
the-dump 2022-05-04 06:42:58 Her parents are kinda overprotective anyways
the-dump 2022-05-04 06:43:11 It's like midnight
the-dump 2022-05-04 06:43:29 Yeah
the-dump 2022-05-04 06:43:45 Honestly... this feels wrong.. but I miss her 😔
the-dump 2022-05-04 06:44:04 HOL UP
the-dump 2022-05-04 06:44:23 WAIT A MINUTE
the-dump 2022-05-04 06:44:33 1
the-dump 2022-05-04 06:45:13 This is why I'm forced to be away from her. Because everything just broke that I've been holding back.. and my anxiety spun out of control
the-dump 2022-05-04 06:46:05 Heh.. out of spite I watched the next episode of the show we were watching together...
the-dump 2022-05-04 06:46:26 I'll fucking do it again when the next one comes out
the-dump 2022-05-04 06:46:50 No

the-dump 2022-05-12 09:19:35 Ironically,  that happened alot in the prototype stage
the-dump 2022-05-12 09:20:02 
the-dump 2022-05-12 09:21:11 Festive excursion
the-dump 2022-05-12 09:21:39 HTI trying to put that old steamer outta business so we started the Arctic Express
the-dump 2022-05-12 09:21:55 Bam
the-dump 2022-05-12 09:22:01 Raw. Power.
the-dump 2022-05-12 09:22:33 A perfect balance in diesel, and perpetual technology...
the-dump 2022-05-12 09:23:21 Accidents do happen though
the-dump 2022-05-12 09:23:35 Sadly not possible in stormworks
the-dump 2022-05-12 09:24:07 Because no
the-dump 2022-05-12 09:24:18 Hover tech is VERY finicky
the-dump 2022-05-12 09:24:36 I've experimented with it before.. and it always crashes to the ground
the-dump 2022-05-12 09:24:42 *literally*
the-dump 2022-05-12 09:25:12 Lonk
the-dump 2022-05-12 09:25:40 I'm aware of my reasons and you don't need to know them
the-dump 2022-05-12 09:26:01 Meh
the-dump 2022-05-12 09:26:05 Go ahear
the-dump 2022-05-12 09:26:24 I disobey that avoid self harm part
the-dump 2022-05-12 09:26:38 I am getting help though
the-dump 2022-05-12 09:26:55 
the-dump 2022-05-12 09:27:19 
the-dump 2022-05-12 09:27:47 
the-dump 2022-05-12 09:28:03 Failure..
the-dump 2022-05-12 09:28:08 It's a factor of engineering
the-dump 2022-05-12 09:29:16 
the-dump 2022-05-12 09:30:47 Ah yes. The prototype
the-dump 2022-05-12 09:30:50 Back when it was a freighter
the-dump 2022-05-12 09:31:08 Had to dig real deep to find these
the-dump 2022-05-14 05:23:32 H
the-dump 2022-05-14 05:24:28 This is it now
the-dump 2022-05-14 05:30:48 Humpback landship
the-dump 2022-05-14 21:54:14 
the-dump 2022-05-14 21:54:38 
the-dump 2022-05-14 21:55:01 Stormbrokes. 
I mean stormworks
the-dump 2022-05-14 21:58:03 Nah
the-dump 2022-05-15 00:19:35 
the-dump 2022-05-15 01:07:37 
the-dump 2022-05-16 21:54:58 
the-dump 2022-05-16 22:07:16 
the-dump 2022-05-16 22:07:56 Pain
the-dump 2022-05-16 22:09:33 I dunno
the-dump 2022-05-16 22:09:44 H
the-dump 2022-05-16 22:57:45 Yes
the-dump 2022-05-16 22:58:14 
the-dump 2022-05-17 02:45:30 Spooder
the-dump 2022-05-17 02:54:07 <@471802613168603173> hey old buddy
the-dump 2022-05-17 02:58:46 Ay
the-dump 2022-05-17 02:59:39 Landship drift
the-dump 2022-05-17 04:26:39 I have to use window mode
the-dump 2022-05-17 04:29:09 Headlights
the-dump 2022-05-17 04:34:56 
the-dump 2022-05-17 04:34:58 Hehe
the-dump 2022-05-17 10:54:30 <a:Ammogus:891573881117237298>
the-dump 2022-05-17 11:11:49 Too bad
the-dump 2022-05-17 11:12:29 
the-dump 2022-05-17 11:12:32 Flashbang
the-dump 2022-05-17 16:29:58 Landship burnout.
*(the bow got wedged under the bridge)*
the-dump 2022-05-17 16:30:39 Nah
the-dump 2022-05-17 16:30:55 I'm just forced to use windowed mode now, since my pc is aging
the-dump 2022-05-17 16:31:00 Well,laptop
the-dump 2022-05-17 16:31:32 
the-dump 2022-05-17 16:32:02 Obviously needs bright lights, since it is a sea crawler
the-dump 2022-05-17 16:33:25 I mean
the-dump 2022-05-17 16:33:33 There's also the headlights..
the-dump 2022-05-17 16:33:44 But they're on a daylight sensor
the-dump 2022-05-17 16:34:03 The lights on that picture are the manual rooflights.
the-dump 2022-05-17 16:34:12 
the-dump 2022-05-17 16:34:28 Be careful what you wish for <:trol:916591571963629608>
the-dump 2022-05-17 16:34:40 Wha
the-dump 2022-05-17 16:34:54 ..
the-dump 2022-05-17 16:35:13 I am limited by the technology of my time
the-dump 2022-05-17 16:35:29 No
the-dump 2022-05-17 16:35:45 I'm not adding more lights for multiple reasons
the-dump 2022-05-17 16:35:58 1.I refuse to build more light mounts
the-dump 2022-05-17 16:36:13 2. My pc can barely handle the lights it has already
the-dump 2022-05-17 16:36:29 3. With all the lights on at once,  it's blinding enough already
the-dump 2022-05-17 16:36:48 There's 4 sets of headlights, only 2 of which are wired up
the-dump 2022-05-17 16:37:15 Not possible
the-dump 2022-05-17 16:37:31 Stormworks has its limits
the-dump 2022-05-17 16:37:49 Anyway
the-dump 2022-05-17 16:38:33 Can't mount that on a landship
the-dump 2022-05-17 16:38:47 It simply doesn't exist in game
the-dump 2022-05-17 16:39:16 Although,  I could use a modded light and break the game with its brightness
the-dump 2022-05-17 16:39:37 I've done it before
the-dump 2022-05-17 16:39:44 And stormworks doesn't like it
the-dump 2022-05-17 16:40:54 Rain never stopped a landship before.
And wet mountains are no match for an exploration class landship.
the-dump 2022-05-17 16:41:12 Small picture
the-dump 2022-05-17 16:52:49 You wish it was pc2
the-dump 2022-05-17 18:45:19 Stormworks
the-dump 2022-05-17 18:45:30 It is stormworks
the-dump 2022-05-17 18:45:37 Because yes
the-dump 2022-05-17 19:15:08 Because I can't afford a "proper" gaming computer
the-dump 2022-05-17 23:37:53 Nice virus <:trol:916591571963629608>
the-dump 2022-05-17 23:42:49 But you can only weld organic conpounds
the-dump 2022-05-17 23:43:05 Lol
the-dump 2022-05-17 23:43:35 Lol
the-dump 2022-05-17 23:43:58 I was thinking like living tissue but that works too
the-dump 2022-05-17 23:44:17 I meant weld
the-dump 2022-05-17 23:44:32 Yes I did
the-dump 2022-05-17 23:44:40 OHHH
the-dump 2022-05-17 23:44:47 I misunderstood lol
the-dump 2022-05-17 23:45:16 Welding organic compounds
the-dump 2022-05-17 23:45:42 You're a master of welding organic compounds together.
the-dump 2022-05-17 23:45:48 You figure it out
the-dump 2022-05-17 23:46:11 
the-dump 2022-05-17 23:46:36 Indeed
the-dump 2022-05-17 23:46:47 
the-dump 2022-05-17 23:48:34 Guys guess what
the-dump 2022-05-17 23:48:48 Get flashbanged
the-dump 2022-05-18 09:39:52 Why'd that song become a meme again?
the-dump 2022-05-20 03:50:14 Under da sea
the-dump 2022-05-20 03:50:14 
the-dump 2022-05-20 03:50:29 ..
the-dump 2022-05-20 03:50:39 Because
the-dump 2022-05-20 03:50:41 I can
the-dump 2022-05-20 03:51:12 How do you know it wasn't to trigger people? <:trol:916591571963629608>
the-dump 2022-05-20 03:51:40 Nah they flat now
the-dump 2022-05-20 03:51:47 
the-dump 2022-05-20 03:51:51 Ran em over
the-dump 2022-05-20 03:52:13 Bruh momwnt
the-dump 2022-05-20 07:27:25 Okay so
the-dump 2022-05-20 07:27:34 It's official
the-dump 2022-05-20 07:28:05 Nautica is classed. Exploration class.
the-dump 2022-05-20 07:28:57 We all wish that was pc2
the-dump 2022-05-20 07:49:10 It's the headlights isn't it?
the-dump 2022-05-20 07:50:13 Nautica can still plow you down you know
the-dump 2022-05-20 07:50:37 
the-dump 2022-05-20 07:50:48 Good
the-dump 2022-05-20 07:51:01 Nautica is built for hazardous environments anyway
the-dump 2022-05-20 07:51:26 Meh
the-dump 2022-05-20 07:53:26 Nani?
the-dump 2022-05-20 15:27:45 Ayo that stern don't lie tho
the-dump 2022-05-20 21:49:27 I bet I can piss off at least 2 people here with two words
the-dump 2022-05-21 20:27:59 
the-dump 2022-05-22 02:10:29 Wherever you go, there you are 
-library of babel
the-dump 2022-05-22 04:09:51 
the-dump 2022-05-22 15:44:41 Okeh
the-dump 2022-05-22 15:44:42 So
the-dump 2022-05-22 15:45:13 LS Nautica has been moved to Franxx class.. with the merger between exploration and franxx class...
the-dump 2022-05-22 15:45:38 My next landship. LS Demon, will be the second in the franxx class. Being designated FX-002
the-dump 2022-05-22 15:46:06 *subtle but obvious zerotwo reference*
the-dump 2022-05-22 15:46:35 <:trol:916591571963629608>
the-dump 2022-05-22 15:46:54 .
the-dump 2022-05-22 15:47:07 Meh
the-dump 2022-05-22 15:47:13 Nah
the-dump 2022-05-22 15:47:25 Hehe
the-dump 2022-05-22 15:47:57 Ara ara
the-dump 2022-05-22 15:48:43 I've gotta figure out how to make horns look good on a landship...
the-dump 2022-05-22 15:48:57 Since, LS Demon is going to be somewhat modeled after Zerotwo
the-dump 2022-05-22 15:49:18 Color scheme will be.. at least
the-dump 2022-05-22 15:49:51 However, it's going to be difficult to make Demon, since I've gotta engineer new tech for it
the-dump 2022-05-22 15:50:22 What
the-dump 2022-05-22 15:50:32 What
the-dump 2022-05-22 15:51:16 I'm making a landship in reference to zerotwo
the-dump 2022-05-22 15:51:29 It's the second in the Franxx class landships
the-dump 2022-05-22 15:51:50 Yes, I have the chance and I'm taking it
the-dump 2022-05-22 15:52:04 Why?
the-dump 2022-05-22 15:53:14 You didn't answer the question
the-dump 2022-05-22 15:53:44 The Franxx class is planned to have 3 ships.
LS Nautica.
LS Demon.
And LS Hiro.
the-dump 2022-05-22 15:54:22 LS Demon,  and LS Hiro are references to two characters from Darling in the Franxx
the-dump 2022-05-22 15:54:34 Nautica is basically a numerical placeholder
the-dump 2022-05-22 15:54:57 F
the-dump 2022-05-22 15:55:11 Demon might have an ara ara hidden on the back bumper.. idk yet
the-dump 2022-05-22 15:55:33 LS Demon is still in the concept phase
the-dump 2022-05-22 15:55:55 .
the-dump 2022-05-22 15:56:33 LS Nautica's stern.
the-dump 2022-05-22 16:03:00 H

the-dump 2022-05-25 22:27:39 
the-dump 2022-05-25 22:27:54 Surprisingly,  landship hulls make great boats
the-dump 2022-05-25 22:28:02 
the-dump 2022-05-26 23:47:33 
the-dump 2022-05-27 14:10:02

the-dump 2022-05-28 20:34:06 Le fishé
the-dump 2022-05-28 20:41:13 Or put gasoline in a water gun and fire with a lighter <:trol:916591571963629608>
the-dump 2022-05-28 20:42:55 That the point <:trol:916591571963629608>
the-dump 2022-05-28 21:05:46 Oop

the-dump 2022-05-28 23:08:32 
the-dump 2022-05-28 23:08:38 
the-dump 2022-05-28 23:08:43 
the-dump 2022-05-28 23:09:25 Most flexible landship yet. *LS Nautica*  **HVD FX-1**
the-dump 2022-05-29 00:40:51 <:trol:916591571963629608>

the-dump 2022-05-29 14:01:31 Ara ara
the-dump 2022-05-29 14:01:45 I dunno I'm bored.. and honestly quite depressed
the-dump 2022-05-29 14:02:00 *I want to die*
the-dump 2022-05-29 14:35:20 *yeet*
the-dump 2022-05-29 17:17:28 Under da sea
the-dump 2022-05-29 21:56:42 
the-dump 2022-05-30 04:16:42 
the-dump 2022-05-30 04:32:47 Yes
the-dump 2022-05-30 22:26:18 
the-dump 2022-05-30 22:28:25 <@456226577798135808> there's your cannon fire
the-dump 2022-05-30 22:28:30 <:trol:916591571963629608>
the-dump 2022-05-30 22:33:05 Stormworks,but now I'm tempted to get unturned
the-dump 2022-05-30 22:33:35 Idk
the-dump 2022-05-30 22:34:30 Modern landships be like
the-dump 2022-05-30 22:34:48 While also
the-dump 2022-05-30 22:36:39 I don't have many pictures of this one...
the-dump 2022-05-30 22:40:27 However, here's one I built in plane crazy
the-dump 2022-05-30 23:12:04 The next one in the Franxx class will have Anti Air capabilities
the-dump 2022-05-30 23:12:23 Nautica is just an unarmed cruiser
the-dump 2022-05-30 23:13:58 LS Titan. Flagship of the Titan class interceptors.
the-dump 2022-05-30 23:14:37 My deadliest landship to date
the-dump 2022-05-31 02:08:51 Stormworks
the-dump 2022-05-31 02:09:59 Ayo what the
the-dump 2022-05-31 02:10:15 I didn't know someone made a roblox ripoff of it
the-dump 2022-05-31 02:10:38 Stormworks is a game on steam
the-dump 2022-05-31 02:10:43 
the-dump 2022-05-31 02:11:00 No, it's literally on steam
the-dump 2022-05-31 02:11:48 https://store.steampowered.com/app/573090/Stormworks_Build_and_Rescue/
the-dump 2022-05-31 02:12:07 Shut
the-dump 2022-05-31 02:12:20 I'll run you over with a landship you heckin bot
the-dump 2022-05-31 02:12:44 Actually
the-dump 2022-05-31 02:12:48 It's rather cheap
the-dump 2022-05-31 02:13:32 Stormworks getting a major update this Friday. Ocean revamp update
the-dump 2022-05-31 02:13:52 Basically the stormworks equivalent of the minecraft Aquatic update
the-dump 2022-05-31 02:14:13 Built this bad Boi in preparation
the-dump 2022-05-31 02:14:25 Multi-player does exist, but it's shit
the-dump 2022-05-31 02:14:45 Stormworks can be seen as a superior version of plane crazy
the-dump 2022-05-31 02:14:49 Because
the-dump 2022-05-31 02:14:52 L o g I c
the-dump 2022-05-31 02:15:55 Anyway. I'm working on my Franxx class landships, and I plan to have *at least* one weeb reference per ship
the-dump 2022-05-31 02:16:05 Nautica has the Ara Ara on the back bumper
the-dump 2022-05-31 02:16:33 LS Demon's reference will be it's serial number. *(HVD FX-002)*
the-dump 2022-05-31 02:17:18 Not sure what to do for the third one tho
the-dump 2022-05-31 02:17:36 
the-dump 2022-05-31 02:18:12 BTW. I'm doing this as a coping mechanism, to get over recent events.
the-dump 2022-05-31 02:18:25 Surprisingly,  it's been working

the-dump 2022-06-03 04:02:57 ..
the-dump 2022-06-03 04:03:09 So was the kraken before I flung it to Brazil
the-dump 2022-06-03 04:03:50 It tried to pry into my ballast vents, but I shut those things so fast it cut a tentacle off
the-dump 2022-06-03 04:04:21

the-dump 2022-06-03 04:07:16 
the-dump 2022-06-03 06:46:26

the-dump 2022-06-04 06:06:00 Melatonin
the-dump 2022-06-04 06:06:12 Somehow, I have become immune to it
the-dump 2022-06-04 06:09:17 Ew genshit
the-dump 2022-06-04 06:09:35 I prefer arknights over genshit

the-dump 2022-06-04 17:00:05 I mean,  he's not wrong

*plasma*
the-dump 2022-06-04 17:01:05 I'm talking about the gas plasma
the-dump 2022-06-04 17:01:09 Ionized air
the-dump 2022-06-04 17:01:47 Nah
the-dump 2022-06-04 17:01:49 Discord
the-dump 2022-06-04 17:02:08 *Discord by definition means disagreement*
the-dump 2022-06-04 17:02:11 Little fun fact
the-dump 2022-06-04 17:02:39 Another little fun fact..
the-dump 2022-06-04 17:03:05 Apparently squids like traumatizing landships
the-dump 2022-06-04 17:03:55 I wonder how many krakens Nautica can handle at once before the breakers pop
the-dump 2022-06-04 17:04:02 You wish
the-dump 2022-06-04 17:04:25 Because screw physics
the-dump 2022-06-04 17:04:52 Explain how a multiple ton landship gets sent flying through the air
the-dump 2022-06-04 17:05:30 Or how the God damn kraken learned to fly
the-dump 2022-06-04 17:06:04 
the-dump 2022-06-04 18:02:13 Indeed
the-dump 2022-06-04 19:02:16 Yes..
the-dump 2022-06-04 19:02:20 Yes
the-dump 2022-06-04 20:29:18 Hey guys
the-dump 2022-06-04 20:29:34 Say ara ara backwards
the-dump 2022-06-04 20:30:38 Nah
the-dump 2022-06-04 20:30:55 ara ara backwards is *~Ara Ara~*
the-dump 2022-06-04 20:37:07 
the-dump 2022-06-04 20:51:15 
the-dump 2022-06-05 01:31:47 *~Ara Ara~*
the-dump 2022-06-05 03:37:00 *ara ara*
the-dump 2022-06-05 06:07:18 All three of my *Franxx* class landships
**HTI-HVD:FX-001** "Nautica" *(Project "Stealthcrawler")*
**HTI-HVD:FX-002** "Demon" *(Project "Zerotwo")*
**HTI-HVD:FX-003** "Hiro" *(Project "Weeabo")*
the-dump 2022-06-05 06:07:52 The names are in fact intentional
the-dump 2022-06-05 07:04:17 Look at the codename for Demon
the-dump 2022-06-05 07:04:20 <:trol:916591571963629608>
the-dump 2022-06-05 07:58:13 
the-dump 2022-06-05 08:39:37

the-dump 2022-06-05 09:11:33 Animated
the-dump 2022-06-05 09:14:58 It worked as intended
the-dump 2022-06-05 09:16:24 Ara ara
the-dump 2022-06-05 09:55:50 
the-dump 2022-06-05 17:28:28 I did a thing
the-dump 2022-06-05 19:59:23 Lights on, Lights off
the-dump 2022-06-05 19:59:29 Redid the nameplates
the-dump 2022-06-05 19:59:58 
the-dump 2022-06-05 21:21:10 How'd I do?
the-dump 2022-06-05 21:22:31 I think the blue can go..darker.
the-dump 2022-06-05 21:22:45 They aren't interlaping
the-dump 2022-06-05 21:23:03 That's kinda tricky, given my level of skill with these
the-dump 2022-06-05 21:23:18 This is not plane crazy
the-dump 2022-06-05 21:23:41 
the-dump 2022-06-05 21:23:45 Stormworks
the-dump 2022-06-05 21:24:10 About that
the-dump 2022-06-05 21:24:17 The red X is at the edge
the-dump 2022-06-05 21:24:33 Can't do that..
the-dump 2022-06-05 21:25:56 Should I go darker on the blue X?
*I took the glow off of it just now*
the-dump 2022-06-05 21:31:47 
the-dump 2022-06-05 21:32:08 Ayo the nameplate looks hella good with bloom on
the-dump 2022-06-05 21:32:34 Thanks
the-dump 2022-06-05 21:35:30 Stormworks
the-dump 2022-06-05 22:31:31 
the-dump 2022-06-05 22:32:27 The landship is fully my own design. The landship class is named after Darling in the Franxx, This ship in particular is named after the fact it was originally a sea crawler.
the-dump 2022-06-05 22:32:49 Also.
the-dump 2022-06-05 22:32:58 Why not?
the-dump 2022-06-05 22:33:19 Meh
the-dump 2022-06-05 22:33:26 Regardless,Franxx class is here to stay
the-dump 2022-06-05 22:33:43 Mainly because the nameplates are so easy to make <:trol:916591571963629608>
the-dump 2022-06-05 22:50:15 Meh
the-dump 2022-06-05 22:50:25 Everyone has an opinion
the-dump 2022-06-05 22:50:38 My opinion? I'm inspired by the Franxx units.
the-dump 2022-06-05 22:52:56 Pfft
the-dump 2022-06-06 00:31:54 
the-dump 2022-06-06 00:34:02 
the-dump 2022-06-06 00:34:22 Attempted replica
the-dump 2022-06-06 00:38:57 Huh...
the-dump 2022-06-06 00:39:21 Well shit now I can't unsee it
the-dump 2022-06-06 00:40:55 ...
the-dump 2022-06-06 00:41:18 Well
the-dump 2022-06-06 00:41:25 The resemblance is there
the-dump 2022-06-06 00:41:43 Although, it's unintentional,  I cannot deny it looks like that
the-dump 2022-06-06 00:43:06 
the-dump 2022-06-06 00:43:49 What?
the-dump 2022-06-06 01:06:30 No you. Because I personally like it
the-dump 2022-06-06 02:45:30 Everyone has an opinion
the-dump 2022-06-06 04:09:34 
the-dump 2022-06-06 17:42:30 Hey guys
the-dump 2022-06-06 17:43:01 Which looks better? *the tracks*
the-dump 2022-06-06 17:43:22 BTW top two are the same thing
the-dump 2022-06-06 18:23:54 Stormworks
the-dump 2022-06-06 18:48:19 Redid them again
the-dump 2022-06-06 18:49:16 Nah
the-dump 2022-06-06 18:49:24 The dump is where I get the most reaction
the-dump 2022-06-06 19:12:41 I'd say so
the-dump 2022-06-06 19:13:12 H
the-dump 2022-06-06 19:15:12 Nautica as a whole took around 2 or 3 weeks
the-dump 2022-06-06 19:15:20 And it's too small to fit drones
the-dump 2022-06-06 19:15:53 There's emergency exits on the roof
the-dump 2022-06-06 19:16:02 Survival, creative...
the-dump 2022-06-06 19:16:06 Both gamemodes
the-dump 2022-06-06 19:16:20 Editor
the-dump 2022-06-06 19:16:32 Not like plane crazy
the-dump 2022-06-06 19:16:44 It's the opposite of plane crazy building
the-dump 2022-06-06 19:18:33 It's an Editor for building
the-dump 2022-06-06 19:18:41 BTW that's the back nameplate
the-dump 2022-06-06 19:18:51 
the-dump 2022-06-06 19:19:17 
the-dump 2022-06-06 19:20:05 No
the-dump 2022-06-06 19:20:16 But the landship after it will
the-dump 2022-06-06 19:20:41 Doesn't exist un game
the-dump 2022-06-06 19:22:25 Can't do that
the-dump 2022-06-06 19:26:33 When you piss off a Franxx class landship
the-dump 2022-06-06 19:27:15 The landship?
the-dump 2022-06-06 19:27:24 LS Nautica
the-dump 2022-06-06 19:41:24 LS Demon will have turrets
the-dump 2022-06-06 19:42:08 Shut
the-dump 2022-06-06 19:42:19 You just toxic because you can't build one <:trol:916591571963629608>
the-dump 2022-06-06 19:42:54 Everyone has an opinion
the-dump 2022-06-06 20:55:13 
the-dump 2022-06-06 21:11:35 Truly menacing
the-dump 2022-06-06 22:00:06 Called updates
the-dump 2022-06-06 22:00:23 You perfect one build before moving onto another
the-dump 2022-06-06 22:01:54 Oh yeah, this is pcc, so nobody will care anyway
the-dump 2022-06-06 22:02:12 It's just fun seeing you all get triggered over the anime references I put on these things
the-dump 2022-06-06 22:03:11 That being said
the-dump 2022-06-06 22:03:38 Yep
the-dump 2022-06-06 22:03:56 Meh
the-dump 2022-06-06 22:04:07 Is it wrong to be proud of your own creation?
the-dump 2022-06-06 22:04:43 Nobody said it's a personality
the-dump 2022-06-06 22:05:04 Nah
the-dump 2022-06-06 22:05:19 I go off of a lot of things
the-dump 2022-06-06 22:05:43 Just sometimes I feel like pissing pcc off
the-dump 2022-06-06 22:05:50 And guess what, it worked <:trol:916591571963629608>
the-dump 2022-06-06 22:10:11 Controlled chaos
the-dump 2022-06-06 22:11:16 You happy now?
the-dump 2022-06-06 22:13:07 Meh
the-dump 2022-06-06 22:13:21 Breathing is *optional*

the-dump 2022-06-07 02:29:02 Nah
the-dump 2022-06-07 02:29:10 
the-dump 2022-06-07 02:29:13 As I said. Relatively wide
the-dump 2022-06-07 02:29:22 That's the old picture
the-dump 2022-06-07 02:29:35 Vs the new one
the-dump 2022-06-07 02:30:15 Old vs new
the-dump 2022-06-07 02:36:59 
the-dump 2022-06-07 02:37:22 I can add as many watermarks as I please <:trol:916591571963629608>

the-dump 2022-06-07 03:22:34 Wouldn't want a fog child
the-dump 2022-06-07 03:31:53 Got a problem?

the-dump 2022-06-07 07:16:37 For the 15th time in 6 weeks...
the-dump 2022-06-07 07:17:08 Fucking hell. Why are breakups so painful?
the-dump 2022-06-07 12:29:31 No, had an existential crisis for the 15th time in 2 months
the-dump 2022-06-07 12:44:38 **totally not losing myself from failed coping mechanisms**
the-dump 2022-06-07 12:46:18 I'm losing my shit bruh
the-dump 2022-06-07 12:46:40 That's a train running you over
the-dump 2022-06-07 12:46:56 It's animated
the-dump 2022-06-07 12:47:29 Though. I might switch it to a group photo of my landships once I finish Franxx class
the-dump 2022-06-07 12:47:40 No, like legit look at my profile
the-dump 2022-06-07 12:48:02 It's a POV of being hit by my Arctic Express train
the-dump 2022-06-07 12:48:16 Anyway..
the-dump 2022-06-07 12:48:24 Sanity is declining
the-dump 2022-06-07 12:49:05 I can feel myself getting lost in my work... which would usually be a good thing...
the-dump 2022-06-07 12:49:08 However..
the-dump 2022-06-07 12:49:48 
the-dump 2022-06-07 12:50:43 
the-dump 2022-06-07 12:50:53 ***help***
the-dump 2022-06-07 12:51:01 ***it's even getting on the ships***
the-dump 2022-06-07 12:51:33 It was originally a way for me to cope with the loss of my beloved...
the-dump 2022-06-07 12:51:45 Designing takes me back to a time when there was no pain
the-dump 2022-06-07 12:52:02 However... it seems it's getting out of hand..
the-dump 2022-06-07 12:52:39 The Franxx class was supposed to be a landship class to let my iner weeb run free to revert my mind to the state it was in before I started dating *her*
the-dump 2022-06-07 12:52:53 However.... it seems it backfired..
And now I'm losing my shit
the-dump 2022-06-07 12:53:30 Tried that
the-dump 2022-06-07 12:53:35 Isolation makes things worse
the-dump 2022-06-07 12:53:47 Never be alone with your thoughts
the-dump 2022-06-07 12:53:50 Trust me
the-dump 2022-06-07 12:54:08 Mostly now, I just use it as background noise
the-dump 2022-06-07 12:54:27 I haven't watched anime in a good 2 weeks..
the-dump 2022-06-07 12:54:35 I do that too...
the-dump 2022-06-07 12:54:43 But regardless..
the-dump 2022-06-07 12:54:47 I'm losing my shit
the-dump 2022-06-07 12:57:20 No
the-dump 2022-06-07 12:57:44 We legit dated in person. I met her at school because I have dual enrollment
the-dump 2022-06-07 12:58:05 Sometimes I wish I had no emotions
the-dump 2022-06-07 12:58:18 *a*
the-dump 2022-06-07 12:58:46 I did
the-dump 2022-06-07 13:01:14 I just want to be happy, like I was before
the-dump 2022-06-07 13:01:43 However. The past is history, what's done is done and there's no changing it..
the-dump 2022-06-07 13:02:14 I can actually push my glasses using my facial muscles
the-dump 2022-06-07 13:02:21 No joke
the-dump 2022-06-07 13:02:44 I rarely touch them to push them up anymore
the-dump 2022-06-07 13:03:41 One of my eyes is fucked
the-dump 2022-06-07 13:03:45 So I wear glasses
the-dump 2022-06-07 13:04:10 You have multiple brain?
the-dump 2022-06-07 13:04:13 Ayo what
the-dump 2022-06-07 13:04:30 ...
the-dump 2022-06-07 13:04:36 I'm confused
the-dump 2022-06-07 13:08:19 Roblox moment
the-dump 2022-06-07 13:11:18 *I can bring the end early*
the-dump 2022-06-07 13:11:33 *I'll fuckin do it too*
the-dump 2022-06-07 13:11:59 *something keeps stopping me when I try though.. some invisible force*
the-dump 2022-06-07 13:12:15 The world is unforgiving
the-dump 2022-06-07 13:12:32 We're nothing but specs
the-dump 2022-06-07 13:12:49 In the end. Nothing we do matters...
the-dump 2022-06-07 13:13:14 Oh to be a frog on a log with not a care in the world
the-dump 2022-06-07 13:13:41 That gave me a stroke
the-dump 2022-06-07 13:14:34 I'm going back to sleep. I hope I can sleep for 30 years...
the-dump 2022-06-07 13:15:14 ...
the-dump 2022-06-07 13:15:49 Sometimes I wish my landships were real so i could run things over with them
the-dump 2022-06-07 13:16:09 *they have plows for a reason*
the-dump 2022-06-07 13:16:47 Ehhhh you might be right... those things are heavy as fuck
the-dump 2022-06-07 13:19:58 The evidence will remain on the bumper. My lamdships can detach their plows and bumpers
the-dump 2022-06-07 13:20:20 ***dents***
the-dump 2022-06-07 13:20:41 A person dents a car by alot if you hit them
the-dump 2022-06-07 13:21:04 *Don't ask how I know*
the-dump 2022-06-07 13:21:26 ..
the-dump 2022-06-07 13:21:50 I'm going back to sleep,to see how long my body will let me sleep before my biological clock kicks in..
the-dump 2022-06-07 14:20:47 It seems my biological clock kicked in because I can't sleep any longer 😔
the-dump 2022-06-07 17:24:35 Demon mode <:trol:916591571963629608>
the-dump 2022-06-07 17:44:17 Shut

the-dump 2022-06-07 20:40:49 Oop
the-dump 2022-06-07 20:41:01 I've never seen it referred to like that
the-dump 2022-06-07 20:42:44 I mean, she do be kinda blocky. Ngl
the-dump 2022-06-07 21:28:17 Highly considered
the-dump 2022-06-07 21:28:31 Yes
the-dump 2022-06-07 21:28:41 Ayo
the-dump 2022-06-07 21:29:16 Wha
the-dump 2022-06-07 21:29:42 It's considered for the next ship in the Franxx class. Nautica is too small for one
the-dump 2022-06-07 21:30:10 No
the-dump 2022-06-07 21:30:23 Way too small to need an elevator
the-dump 2022-06-07 21:30:41 Way too small for that
the-dump 2022-06-07 21:31:04 .
the-dump 2022-06-07 21:31:09 Did I stutter?
the-dump 2022-06-07 21:32:30 ...
the-dump 2022-06-07 21:32:33 You do realize
the-dump 2022-06-07 21:32:40 This is a sea crawler
the-dump 2022-06-07 21:33:15 
the-dump 2022-06-07 21:33:35 Wha
the-dump 2022-06-07 21:33:43 It's on the workshop
the-dump 2022-06-07 21:33:51 I can't screen record because my pc is shit
the-dump 2022-06-07 21:34:36 Adding airborne propulsion <:trol:916591571963629608>
the-dump 2022-06-07 21:35:01 It's both
the-dump 2022-06-07 21:35:17 Nautica is a landship, that can operate as a submarine, or a sea crawler
the-dump 2022-06-07 21:35:34 And, if I can get this right...
the-dump 2022-06-07 21:35:36 An aircraft
the-dump 2022-06-07 21:35:50 Yes
the-dump 2022-06-07 21:38:13 Wha?
the-dump 2022-06-07 21:38:17 No
the-dump 2022-06-07 21:38:26 Nautica is not designed for cargo
the-dump 2022-06-07 21:38:35 However, LS Hiro will be a carrier landship
the-dump 2022-06-07 21:46:19 O
the-dump 2022-06-07 21:46:36 Lmfao it's trying so hard to flip back over
the-dump 2022-06-07 21:53:02 What do you think is trying to flip it?
the-dump 2022-06-07 21:54:34 So I added some offset to the pivot for the flip beams
the-dump 2022-06-07 21:54:41 And it works
the-dump 2022-06-08 00:26:34 Man screw society
the-dump 2022-06-08 00:26:42 Also screw physics
the-dump 2022-06-08 00:26:51 Become uncontrollable
the-dump 2022-06-08 00:30:22 Oop
the-dump 2022-06-08 02:37:25 Depressed. And losing my shit
the-dump 2022-06-08 02:38:06 The breakup is what's wrong... the past keeps coming back
the-dump 2022-06-08 02:38:48 I hope I find someone senior year,  or at least soon..
the-dump 2022-06-08 02:39:04 😔
the-dump 2022-06-08 02:39:09 I'm aware of that
the-dump 2022-06-08 02:39:48 I've taken up anime, and becoming embedded into designing landships as a coping method...
the-dump 2022-06-08 02:40:45 Both of which have failed me
the-dump 2022-06-08 02:42:06 ..
the-dump 2022-06-08 02:42:09 What?
the-dump 2022-06-08 02:42:21 Can't a person be honest?
the-dump 2022-06-08 02:42:37 Jeez sometimes I wish I could yeet my emotions to brazil
the-dump 2022-06-08 02:42:47 Become emotionless
the-dump 2022-06-08 02:42:50 But no.
the-dump 2022-06-08 02:43:01 Heartbreak shakes me to my core
the-dump 2022-06-08 02:43:44 Like an earthquake breaking the ground, similarly this is breaking my mind.
the-dump 2022-06-08 02:44:08 No
the-dump 2022-06-08 02:44:20 I ironically do that when I'm stressed
the-dump 2022-06-08 02:44:56 Le fishe
the-dump 2022-06-08 02:46:12 I don't know why I even bother hoping things will get better.
the-dump 2022-06-08 02:46:23 Truth is, they probably won't
the-dump 2022-06-08 02:47:06 I might as well just stop fighting... and just give in to the thoughts until they bring my demise
the-dump 2022-06-08 02:48:38 I have. And it doesn't work
the-dump 2022-06-08 02:49:12 *the void grows deeper,and deeper pulling at the faint strands that are left of my will to live*
the-dump 2022-06-08 02:49:51 I don't know why I even try anymore
the-dump 2022-06-08 02:50:44 I don't take P.E

the-dump 2022-06-16 00:40:24 I had panic attacks..
the-dump 2022-06-16 00:40:35 17, turning 18 this December

the-dump 2022-07-11 22:40:28 I have the entire thing <:trol:916591571963629608>
the-dump 2022-07-11 22:41:15 Come over here beside me. My restraint crumbles.
Just Don’t you fear me now~

Ah~

A flightless bird dreamed of the sky.
The colors mixing there are a different kind of red.~

I covered my ears to the sound of knocking on my door.
Is that you knocking? Or is it some other?~

Will your lips taste the kiss of death?

Darling, fate runs through my veins
As this world begins to move …is it love?~

I want to melt like no one has before, Darling.
So don’t fear me, just kiss me now!

I want to taste you …does that make me weird?

It’s something we’re unable to feel all alone.

Embracing one another will keep our wounds sealed,
So I’ll seal your breath with my lips.

Will your lips taste the kiss of death?
Darling, what is this melting feeling I feel
From the beating of my heart to the tips of my fingers? 

Hey…
Come over here beside me. My restraint crumbles.

So don’t fear me, just kiss me now, my love!~

I felt something like the moment of death~
With your taste.

Did your lips taste the kiss of death? (Death, Death~)

Darling, fate runs through my veins
As this world begins to move …is it love?

I want to melt like no one has before, Darling.

So don’t fear me, 
Let me taste you,oh just kiss me now!
the-dump 2022-07-11 22:41:32 Hehe
the-dump 2022-07-11 22:42:33 Yes
the-dump 2022-07-11 22:43:08 Inexperienced
Heartless
But even so
Be beautiful

No destiny, unworthy
If we just talk as if it's never enough
"If it's like this then probably things will go well"
Things, money, love, words
I'm tired of self-asserting myself already
Déjà vu, what are you so unsatisfied about?
You've said all sorts of selfish things
What more could you possibly want?
But surprise, I don't hate this situation
Already, "I'm sick of hearing that line"
The one thing I don't want is ambiguousness

Enough
Even if you say to do this or that
Even if you say you love me or why?
It's easy if it's just for fun
And that it's reckless serious negotiating
Those contemptuous and surprising words
How many times do you want to use?
Anyway
I was hoping it even in a fixed game

Even all those quoted phrases
Those words make people tiptoe
Let these things become taboo
Take a hint, don't let it rain

I hate talking in a roundabout way
If you must speak, "Answer it within two words"
Red butterfly, even a letter can not be served
Spreading a fragile folding fan
That is more attractive, isn't it?

Confused
If you can't answer, please leave me alone
The key words, but you don't listen
If it is only for the sake of peace of mind and then fall
Sweet raindrops
You also want to hold up the umbrella, right?
Like this
I hope I can always look forward to it
I closed my eyes
I wanted to change
Pretending to be an adult
Lost
But things are irreparable
Now, please don't stop raining

the-dump 2022-07-12 01:19:23 Ara ara
the-dump 2022-07-12 01:19:43 Yes. As of recently I have been thinking of that
the-dump 2022-07-12 01:20:06 Okay i might be fucked up. But I'm not that fucked up
the-dump 2022-07-12 01:20:58 Literally me with cat litter
the-dump 2022-07-12 01:21:59 Can't be bothered to carry that shit
the-dump 2022-07-12 01:22:17 I mean. I *can* but if someone else can why bother <:trol:916591571963629608>
the-dump 2022-07-12 01:22:54 Oop

the-dump 2022-07-12 01:35:43 oh well ¯\\_(ツ)\_/¯
the-dump 2022-07-12 01:37:28 I've started dating for like the 4th time
the-dump 2022-07-12 01:38:15 ..
the-dump 2022-07-12 01:38:51 Hey guys
the-dump 2022-07-12 01:38:56 I have a theory
the-dump 2022-07-12 01:39:02 So. Fish..
the-dump 2022-07-12 01:39:18 To them, the surface is what they perceive as space
the-dump 2022-07-12 01:39:23 They can't breathe
the-dump 2022-07-12 01:39:26 They can't survive
the-dump 2022-07-12 01:39:38 On the surface, there are animals that survive
the-dump 2022-07-12 01:39:41 IE Us
the-dump 2022-07-12 01:39:44 So what if
the-dump 2022-07-12 01:39:49 There were animals in space
the-dump 2022-07-12 01:40:04 That we just can't see because we're looking wrong
the-dump 2022-07-12 01:40:21 No, like they could somehow breathe.  Think Fish out of water
the-dump 2022-07-12 01:40:37 I had that idea at work 💀
the-dump 2022-07-12 01:41:07 I had a shower thought washing golfcarts lmao
the-dump 2022-07-12 01:41:25 I should pitch that idea to nasa lol
the-dump 2022-07-12 01:42:27 Screw you I can drift a landship
the-dump 2022-07-12 01:43:44 See. That's the theory
the-dump 2022-07-12 01:44:00 Think of a Fish, versus Us
the-dump 2022-07-12 01:44:11 We have a different organ structure to survive on the surface
the-dump 2022-07-12 01:44:16 Compared to a fish k water
the-dump 2022-07-12 01:44:25 Nono hear me out
the-dump 2022-07-12 01:44:38 Now what if..
the-dump 2022-07-12 01:44:42 These creatures
the-dump 2022-07-12 01:44:54 Hitched a ride on the satellites we sent up into space
the-dump 2022-07-12 01:45:11 And are just hiding on the side we can't see (the side that faces away from earth)
the-dump 2022-07-12 01:45:51 One would think that youd be able to see it with another one right? Wrong.  They're so far apart you can barely see them even from the SS
the-dump 2022-07-12 01:46:06 Also so small by comparison
the-dump 2022-07-12 01:46:27 It sounds like a shower thought
the-dump 2022-07-12 01:46:40 Lmao
the-dump 2022-07-12 01:46:49 Tardegrades
the-dump 2022-07-12 01:46:54 I spelt it wrong
the-dump 2022-07-12 01:47:22 But what if there were complex ones
the-dump 2022-07-12 01:47:30 Like. Similar to us
the-dump 2022-07-12 01:47:43 But compleatly evolved for the vacuum of space
the-dump 2022-07-12 01:48:00 Wait.. what would that look like?
the-dump 2022-07-12 01:48:09 PFFT
the-dump 2022-07-12 01:49:21 Watch i get taken by the FBI
the-dump 2022-07-12 01:49:35 I sharpened a pencil eraser once
the-dump 2022-07-12 01:49:59 Sharp eraser

the-dump 2022-07-12 01:55:36 I'm assuming it works
