help 2018-12-09 06:43:03 why cant this fly straight up
help 2018-12-09 06:43:29 the center of mass is inbetween the propellers almost perfectly
help 2018-12-09 06:43:39 w
help 2018-12-09 06:44:19 yes it flips  over backwards almost instantly
help 2018-12-30 13:14:07 u need the axle things that hold the wheels on to rotate and u need what doomfire said
help 2019-01-02 01:22:13 i just tested a plane earlier and it worked perfectly now it all of a sudden doesnt work anymore
help 2019-01-02 01:22:50 and i didnt change anything
help 2019-01-02 01:24:45 now it works again what
help 2019-01-03 05:19:23 why dont engines work after they get disconnected from the pilot seat after i turn them on
help 2019-01-03 05:39:03 even wings stop working when that happens
help 2019-01-31 23:29:58 why does this helicopter always try to tilt to the left when i start flying
help 2019-01-31 23:37:33 it doesnt rotate it tilts
help 2019-01-31 23:37:51 the back rotor thing cancels out the rotation
help 2019-01-31 23:54:01 i tried to put the center of mass in the right spot and it made the tilting worse
help 2019-02-01 00:14:12 i just tested the helicopters tilt on every axis individually and it had no tilt but when i tried to fly it normally it tilted and crashed almost instantly
help 2019-02-01 00:16:01 k
help 2019-02-01 00:18:10 wait how much do i move  the center of  mass
help 2019-02-01 00:18:18 is it till its level with the tail rotor
help 2019-02-01 00:46:07 i added as much weight as i could to the top and removed weight from the bottom and its still tilting exactly like it was before
help 2019-02-01 03:42:55 i still cant get this helicopter to stop tilting
help 2019-02-01 04:09:23 it tilts to the right easier now  but still tilts to the left on take off
help 2019-02-01 04:10:59 the tilt is much worse if i try to go forward
help 2019-02-01 04:14:40 to the point where it starts to actually flip
help 2019-02-01 22:08:08 everything ive done has either not changed the flipping at all or  made it worse
help 2019-02-01 22:08:17 and its not spinning it does like a corkscrew dive
help 2019-02-01 22:34:18 i just ended up making another rotor even tho i didnt want to and it works now
help 2019-02-02 22:35:50 is there a way to make motors glitch out less
help 2019-02-02 22:36:13 the helicopter i made gets more glitchy every time i spawn it in
help 2019-02-02 22:39:33 its like impossible to fly my helicopter for more than 30 seconds without the rotor blades spazzing out and getting stuck
help 2019-02-02 22:44:25 how do i stop these rotor blades from glitching out and getting stuck like this
help 2019-02-02 22:46:17 the same thing with motors spazzing out has broken 2 of my helicopters
help 2019-02-03 06:48:06 yes i think
help 2019-02-03 11:04:13 whatever propulsion you have is probably making it flip if they arent like alligned with the center of mass or mirrored around it
help 2019-02-04 00:54:47 how do i make these motors stay in sync cuz they always get off sync after like 15 seconds
help 2019-02-04 00:54:56 the 4 center  ones
help 2019-02-04 00:55:02 that move the legs
help 2019-02-04 00:58:06 
help 2019-02-04 01:44:39 yes they are weight
help 2019-02-04 21:57:29 what blocks have a lot of grip
