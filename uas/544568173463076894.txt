plane-crazy 2020-06-27 22:13:21 ?
plane-crazy 2020-06-26 21:42:18 That’s why  I suggested sticky blocks
plane-crazy 2020-06-26 21:42:05 I can’t figure out how to get 1 magnet to stick to another magnet
plane-crazy 2020-06-26 21:38:55 What do magnets do?
plane-crazy 2020-06-26 21:33:16 Ok I did
plane-crazy 2020-06-26 21:24:23 I have a suggestion add sticky blocks where when they touch another block they become stuck to each other (my idea with this is to make folds less glitchy)
