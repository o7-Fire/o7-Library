help 2021-12-08 10:59:52 becuse i do have 3 1x4
help 2021-12-08 11:00:53 there's a slight problem, the smaller the wing upfront the less drag I have
help 2021-12-08 11:01:11 plus my plane top speed is 310 knots
help 2021-12-08 11:02:00 eh idk, I think it looks good for now

creations-chat 2021-12-08 11:30:27 I tried, the only thing close is a 1x1 wheel which looks too weird, and too small, plus I still have some skill issues that I can't seem to do, I tried to use camera lock, angle lock and such stuff but things... didn't really work out
creations-chat 2021-12-08 11:35:30 wouldn't that make it the same?
creations-chat 2021-12-08 11:38:24 Okay but... how will it retract?

help 2021-12-08 12:14:04 plain?
help 2021-12-08 12:14:16 Lets just say there is not much details

help 2021-12-08 12:18:25 I KNOW
help 2021-12-08 12:18:34 Goddamit I still have skill issues dammit
help 2021-12-08 12:18:54 Look, I dont have the perfect wheel
help 2021-12-08 12:19:26 even the half cylinders still look fat as hell
help 2021-12-08 12:21:00 whatever I do with the wheel, it still looks bad
help 2021-12-08 12:21:20 if there is a resize tool, it's possible
help 2021-12-08 12:22:04 which one? 1x1? if yes, it looks bad
help 2021-12-08 12:22:31 it's so small ;/

help 2021-12-08 13:45:17 the wing is actually around... I'm guessing 6 blocks wide
help 2021-12-08 13:45:24 btw I'ma start building it
help 2021-12-08 13:53:02 true
help 2021-12-08 13:53:19 tbh I like building unusual and weird looking planes

help 2021-12-08 14:06:08 Because I think thats gonna be a problem for me to build
help 2021-12-08 14:06:25 I only see one seat on-top
help 2021-12-08 14:06:46 I guess this Amiot is smaller than I thought
