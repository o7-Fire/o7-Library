creations-chat 2021-03-05 21:03:33 i need more opinions about the blue hawaiian heli i made
creations-chat 2021-03-06 02:15:47 so basically, https://streamable.com/tejube
creations-chat 2021-03-06 02:19:47 can fly upside down, rotor is not really a vital part, just there because its a helicopter and also for looks, also can do back flips
creations-chat 2021-03-09 02:06:41 it will also be in <#384025409945337856> , also sorry for the default colors, just a quick project to see on how good i can make cars [rvs to be specific] and i wanted your guys' opinions on it
creations-chat 2021-03-09 02:13:51 i know its bad and i know its 16 screenshots, i need opinion
creations-chat 2021-03-09 02:15:52 maybe its better i kept the vehicle to myself
creations-chat 2021-03-09 04:56:05 the community hasnt made blimps much, we should try making them more often, its a good idea

creations-chat 2021-03-29 19:03:58 jerry the gunship. https://streamable.com/44167b [comes with a collar that includes his name, (imeanitsacollar.) his respective owners phone number, and working eye cameras, and also when you fire the gun it does a little funny sound]
creations-chat 2021-03-29 19:06:08 also he can take naps, which i think is the best thing about him, but also he has roar noises, and rotor sounds
creations-chat 2021-03-29 19:24:11 gunships are fat
creations-chat 2021-03-29 19:38:50 https://streamable.com/gc0w6m this is a drone controlled by jerry, he wanted to see what would happen if he clicked the self destruct button, and this is what happened to the drone replica of him
