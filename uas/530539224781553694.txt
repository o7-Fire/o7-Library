help 2020-02-12 19:05:29 I'm working on a tank with conveyor treads but for whatever reason it stops moving when it exits the blue square, even if the conveyors are still moving.
creations-chat 2020-02-12 20:52:00 A maneuverable,  light and fast and hard to hit pvp drone ive been working on. what do you all think of it?
creations-chat 2020-02-12 20:59:23 can i have advice to improve how it looks atleast?
creations-chat 2020-02-12 21:05:40 very big Oof.
creations-chat 2020-02-12 21:10:22 Alright, Thanks for actually being helpful and not so bloody harsh.
creations-chat 2020-02-12 21:13:33 Ya i know, it does discourage alot tho.
And mew, wouldnt that be space costly? i can see how its good for larger builds but the build im doing is a bit small, one block tall at the most
creations-chat 2020-02-12 21:14:31 alright. What are some wing designs from real aircraft that would look good on the drone?
creations-chat 2020-02-12 21:14:45 or atleast something i can have a reference on.
creations-chat 2020-02-12 21:16:48 ah i understand. So leave the back and work on the more forward part of the drone?
creations-chat 2020-02-12 21:17:49 Alright. Would it be ok to leave the size to a average of a half block?
creations-chat 2020-02-12 21:18:03 as in height
creations-chat 2020-02-12 21:19:32 alright. Should i do a basic pyramid nose?
creations-chat 2020-02-12 21:20:10 alright.
creations-chat 2020-02-12 21:38:54 Thanks i suppose but i do see the flaws which is what im experimenting on.
creations-chat 2020-02-12 22:05:03 Hey mew, i experimented with the main body of the aircraft, i can show it to you if you'd like so i can know what to change.
