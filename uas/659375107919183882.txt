bug-reports 2022-10-08 14:14:37 1. My alt account can paint other’s builds and the others see it too.

2. Players can edit texts without screwdriver tool when build spawned.

creations-chat 2022-10-08 17:07:06 currently building a new space shuttle launch pad cuz the one i currently got is ass. to be honest, it was rushed.
creations-chat 2022-10-08 17:09:14 guys should i add the treads to the rollout pad or just use custom fabric wheels
creations-chat 2022-11-01 21:45:51 relax bro
creations-chat 2022-11-01 21:48:11 bro 😐
creations-chat 2022-11-09 22:23:35 it took me 9 months to build it 😎
creations-chat 2022-11-14 22:03:44 you will get used to it
creations-chat 2022-11-14 22:05:47 💀 Can't get used to it
creations-chat 2022-11-14 22:21:59 Can't wait to finish Space Shuttle Mega Project and post it here! uses 4 accounts and its 32.7k blocks currently. And of course laggy af 💀

Here is an outdated image as I don't want to spoil the end result. This is just a small sneak peak for you guys to let me know what to be improved / added.

Please be fully honest as we want to make this as accurate as possible. We won't get mad at horrible comments.
creations-chat 2022-11-14 22:25:38 ok my honest response

1st. How are we gonna fit all of that in one tiny plot?
2nd. Wdym no terrain?
3rd. And again, no space. Launch Site massive and would take a massive amount of alts. Plus if you want us to make it in one account, that would be impossible 💀.
4th. Are you serious bro? We aint posting this for jokes.
creations-chat 2022-11-14 22:28:05 yeah RSS not even finished yet even tho it looks finished
creations-chat 2022-11-14 22:30:09 thank god. Imagine spending 9 months trying to figure out how to fit all of that in one account 💀
creations-chat 2022-11-14 22:40:33 We aint aiming for hall of fame. We are just posting for fun.
creations-chat 2022-11-14 22:43:08 Maybe not the structures because they are under development but the shuttle does have tiny details. Also thx.

<@297120728342331392> I repeat myself again. We are not aiming for hof, we are posting for fun.
