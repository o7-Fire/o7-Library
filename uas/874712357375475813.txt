creations-chat 2022-01-14 04:06:24 I like the use of the skis and the ladders
bot-central 2022-04-26 15:09:06 huh
bot-central 2022-04-26 15:09:20 I do have a pretty high level if I say so myself lol
bot-central 2022-04-26 15:09:27 (/s)
bot-central 2022-04-26 15:09:54 !rank
bot-central 2022-04-26 15:10:12 So if I chat more that means I can level up?
bot-central 2022-04-26 15:10:20 Oh
bot-central 2022-04-26 15:10:29 This probably means I should rnak up

bot-central 2022-04-26 17:14:59 I can attach
creations-chat 2022-04-26 17:38:41 I don't have any words to describe my confusion
creations-chat 2022-04-26 17:42:13 No this is not a tutorial, please don't ask
creations-chat 2022-04-26 17:46:46 anyone have suggestions to make my B-17g better in <#384025409945337856> ?
creations-chat 2022-04-26 18:03:35 proof?
creations-chat 2022-04-26 18:05:53 It's the most unsightly thing ab the build : (
creations-chat 2022-04-26 18:14:21 so you agree it's not a tutorial?
creations-chat 2023-03-03 01:45:21 Will I get 10000000 F-22s sent to my home for being the 10000000th person to post an F-22
creations-chat 2023-03-03 01:47:31 That's a tad bit concerning, but I'm grateful for the prize considering my efforts
creations-chat 2023-03-03 01:49:54 Why not 10000000 pipebombs : (
creations-chat 2023-03-03 02:05:19 No I used https://imagecolorpicker.com/en, with the attached image (except I slightly edited the RGB values so that they are slightly lighter than the ones in the picture)
creations-chat 2023-03-03 02:10:27 Yeah the nose and the canopy (and the exposed locking), are pretty bad but I wouldn't say that it's horseshit (not sure if you meant the paint, or the actual jet itself). But then again I did post it in <#384025409945337856> so I guess I shouldn't have expected the reactions to be good.
creations-chat 2023-03-03 02:14:52 For future reference, what did you mean that it was horseshit. What made it so that it was justifiable to call it horseshit, this is so I can avoid those mistakes when I build it (or other builds) again in the future
creations-chat 2023-03-03 02:32:45 Thanks! Btw is this: https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/f22-raptor-2a64abf0866a405c865466c7642ca689 a good 3D model to reference while building an F-22
creations-chat 2023-03-03 02:46:26 Also thanks for going through the trouble of editing the images to show what you were talking about
creations-chat 2023-03-04 03:08:43 Was it really that bad (though I still do think the things you pointed out were valid), or was it really bland and not innovative (as in it didn't really do anything to add onto what you usually see in a Plane Crazy F-22)
creations-chat 2023-03-04 03:16:00 Was it bad to the point where it's as bad as, for example, Plane Crazy's official tutorial plane with spammed rockets and guns? I really did try on this build to not be as bad as possible : (
creations-chat 2023-03-04 03:22:45 As in bad when held to the standard of players like justrens (I don't know that many famous plane crazy builders)? or is it bad when held to the standards of people who are ok/sorta good
creations-chat 2023-03-04 03:29:27 He's quite nice : D, he gave me actual feedback
creations-chat 2023-03-04 03:31:52 Oh ok, well, thanks for your help!
