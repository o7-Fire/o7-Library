creations-chat 2022-12-10 16:24:41 the cockpit part is a glitch, its not a failed one, the canopy is actually perfect but the cylinder shows even if it is inside of other idk why
creations-chat 2022-12-10 16:30:23 even though this is a wip, i never changed the canopy so this is the same

creations-chat 2023-06-30 16:21:30 bro i dont play plane crazy for years dude
creations-chat 2023-06-30 16:24:01 i think i cant even motorlock now, bruh
creations-chat 2023-06-30 16:28:01 maybe a trapdoor or a disconector
creations-chat 2023-06-30 16:30:09 put it inside with motorlock then
creations-chat 2023-06-30 16:33:45 then use a half wedge 2 i guess (i dont play pc for years idk if its the right wedge)
creations-chat 2023-07-05 07:34:02 bro im going to cry, my helicopter is only 974 blocks and its so heavy, i dont know how i managed to make it fly
