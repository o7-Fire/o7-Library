either way, you have earned my respect, keep up the good work and i'll hope you would do an even better job with your next ship <:BlobThumbsUp:645126335806832659>

creations-chat 2020-10-18 11:06:55 when i try to replicate a real life ship, i usually google a blueprint, then reduce the image's resolution until it become pixelated enough
then i make outlines of the hull using the pencil tool, after that i save the image and use said image to build 
maybe you could try that, could be too complicated but eh <:4Shrug:557226759909539851>
