Buttons and levers
[gameplay]
Those things would be cool when making different mechanisms with which other players could interact like piston and motors custom doors, elevators, etc

creations-chat 2022-03-19 12:26:41 dayum i am getting downvote bombed cause my plane isnt 100% motorlock XD
creations-chat 2022-03-19 12:44:45 nah homie, motorlock spams are shi*, just copying what tens of people have done with a tiny variation isnt good looking
creations-chat 2022-03-19 12:46:50 average motorlock spammer:
-Do something every other motorlock spammer has done before
-Tryhard on the people who dont motorlock spam
-Cry when their motorlock copy gets downvote bombed as hard as a non motorlock build
creations-chat 2022-03-19 12:49:17 Well the upvoted ones, not concidered crap are just motorlock spams, man i hope pc2 will make motorlock either hard or destroy it completely
creations-chat 2022-03-19 12:58:33 nah, its just the motor lock people, thinking they are better than anyone else and are toxic to people who don't use it.
creations-chat 2022-03-19 14:50:53 yes
creations-chat 2022-03-19 14:52:55 i don't know
I don't really blame it, i just hate ml
creations-chat 2022-03-19 14:54:59 Yes but i am not changing my mind
I might be an outcast but i will stand against it
creations-chat 2022-03-19 15:03:38 ik i admit it i have no clue  how this shit works
I am only capable of using the most basic motorlocks imaginable
my brain pulls windowscrash.exe everytime i try to understand how to make builds using it
creations-chat 2022-03-19 15:06:48 now give me a fire extinguisher cause my brain is smoking more than the 1st ever computer if you would try to run fortnite, cod vanguard and cyberpunk at the same time all on the highest graphics
creations-chat 2022-03-19 15:12:22 as a zeppelin wars player i can say that it is a very well recreation
||By plane crazy standards it is ugly, but so would be the original zw zeppelin model||
creations-chat 2022-03-19 15:15:22 no, its just an accurate recreation
the build is simple cause the original model is simple, dont belive me just look at the original
creations-chat 2022-03-19 15:17:49 the front is dang weird, and the baloon is too small but overall its decent
creations-chat 2022-03-19 15:20:40 why everyone just hates me
creations-chat 2022-05-10 16:13:32 Glitch crazy

creations-chat 2022-08-17 22:26:39 Man i really don't understand PC community creation upvoting criteria.

Sometimes someone makes a really good looking detailed build and get hella downvoted, while the other guy makes a low efford hamster and get houndreds of upvotes
creations-chat 2022-08-17 22:29:44 its not about me,  i build like garbage so no matter what i get downvoted
creations-chat 2022-08-22 12:52:37 ayo do you things those wings are good enough for my plane (ik its ugly, but i want to know if the wings fit the uglyness or are even uglier)
creations-chat 2022-08-22 12:54:44 should i make deez wings smaller?
creations-chat 2022-08-22 12:58:47 Well what do you think, leave those wings me or make them smaller
creations-chat 2022-08-27 16:59:00 as a person with no motorlock abilities i shall say
Sheesh
