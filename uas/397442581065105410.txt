The Tale of brownie8590 (397442581065105410)
help 2021-08-24 18:20:28 yes
help 2021-08-24 18:21:07 there's almost no limits on what you can do aslong as it flies and doesn't use hover engines
help 2021-08-24 18:23:52 you might want to make it a lot thinner and round
help 2021-08-24 18:23:59 chunky planes dont tend to fly well
help 2021-08-24 18:24:14 unless you're making a cargo plane
help 2021-08-24 18:24:59 im trying to find a good example of one of my jets
help 2021-08-24 18:26:52 <@!809951794402558023> basically every jet has this basic 2x2 nose with a pyramid on the nose
help 2021-08-24 18:27:18 you can draw the body back with the same thickness to form a nice body
help 2021-08-24 18:28:01 thats why i said "basically"
help 2021-08-24 18:28:24 so yea, not every jet uses it. for example, I had to use some very different tactics trying to make a nose for the mirage 2000
help 2021-08-24 18:28:31 long boi
help 2021-08-24 18:29:20 what plane are you making
help 2021-08-24 18:29:23 or is it custom
help 2021-08-24 18:29:47 you
help 2021-08-24 18:30:51 for that, then yea, you might want to limit the body width to 2x2 made up of 2 half blocks and 1 block
help 2021-08-24 18:31:22 like skeppy said, you could start with a lot of tutorials, you get free vehicles for pvp, and you learn a whole lot

help 2021-08-24 18:48:42 you used 2x1 blocks for the nose

help 2021-08-24 18:51:40 you close it off with a pyramid wedge
help 2021-08-24 18:58:50 delete about 4 half blocks from the top and fill it in with a half wedge from "wedges" at the front and back
help 2021-08-24 18:59:28 like this
help 2021-08-24 18:59:44 its a very basic cockpit shake, and you can improve it as you go
