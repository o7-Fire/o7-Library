help 2020-07-14 02:44:08 I was using locked motors for more control but somethings causing them to spas out
help 2020-07-14 02:44:30 I removed what I thought were the problem motors that rotated the hub, but they could still spas out sometimes
help 2020-07-14 02:44:40 I think itâ€™s just a problem with locked motors
