help 2023-06-13 12:14:29 As soon as I add motor locking into the turret to make it looks like a T-72 turret
help 2023-06-13 12:14:35 It stops moving around
help 2023-06-13 12:27:51 I’m pretty sure it is
help 2023-06-13 12:28:06 But I cant figure out where that part of the motor lock sits within my tower

help 2023-06-13 12:35:39 Lil hard to understand
help 2023-06-13 12:44:27 Ok
help 2023-06-13 12:58:39 Yeah
help 2023-06-13 12:58:42 I was thinking that
help 2023-06-13 12:58:47 I got most of it fixed
help 2023-06-13 12:59:01 All I did was increase motor torque from 30-1000
help 2023-06-13 12:59:14 And I made my piston go from 0.75 up to 1
help 2023-06-13 12:59:26 But I’ll refine that piston as I want it close to the hull
