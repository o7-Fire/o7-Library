bug-reports 2020-06-30 10:29:44 Tips of the day: Write Useful Comments

Comments are crucial. You wonâ€™t appreciate them until you leave your thousand-line script for a couple of days and return to and try and make sense of it. Useful comments make life easier for yourself and those after you who have to maintain your code.
Write meaningful, single line comments for vague lines; write full parameter and functionality descriptions for functions and methods; for tricky logic blocks, describe the logic in words before it if necessary. And donâ€™t forget, always keep your comments up to date!
