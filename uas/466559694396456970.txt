creations-chat 2021-01-05 17:21:44 <@!478926341539102740> you can safely use metal blocks, they dont increase weight from what i tested

even if you do make it out of metal and it somehow has more weight, you can easily make it all back to the default material without losing any colors
creations-chat 2021-01-05 17:26:33 metal gives shiny effect too
