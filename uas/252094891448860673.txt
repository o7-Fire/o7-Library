help 2018-09-05 22:32:10 What should I add to my carrier?
help 2018-09-05 22:34:20 Already have a launch catapult, but only littlegunner is utilizing it
help 2018-09-05 22:34:34 It needs the other plane to have a piston though
help 2018-09-05 22:35:28 I'd like to add a lot more, but the glitch is preventing me from doing so
help 2018-09-05 22:35:35 I don't know if its the save slot I'm using
help 2018-09-05 22:36:46 I think what I could do is just save this to another slot

help 2018-09-24 21:51:01 Video?
help 2018-09-24 21:52:41 That's just the motors glitching out
help 2018-09-24 21:52:44 Does that sometimes
help 2018-09-24 21:55:05 Not really
help 2018-09-24 21:55:16 I'd probably just save and reload

help 2018-10-04 21:25:20 Please help
help 2018-10-04 21:26:50 I think its only effecting me
help 2018-10-04 21:27:27 I think it *might* be because I have 3 massive creations that take up a lot of storage so there might not be enough serverstorage to actually save my B-2
help 2018-10-04 21:30:34 Last time this save glitch has happened to me was with my carrier
help 2018-10-04 21:33:45 Propeller blades have a tendency to cause instability
help 2018-10-04 21:34:06 I'd probably add more wing panels to help reduce the wobbling that the motors produce

bug-reports 2018-10-07 14:05:10 You can clearly see I have the paint bucket deselected
bug-reports 2018-10-07 14:22:30 Don't know if this is a bug or just code limitations but the colors don't save as their original
bug-reports 2018-10-07 14:28:11 Its kinda pointless to have the custom color code system if it doesn't want to save in that color
bug-reports 2018-10-07 14:29:23 Still kinda pointless to have it though
bug-reports 2018-10-07 14:29:36 You could just add the entire default color pallet

help 2018-10-08 16:36:16 You using any motors on the flag?
help 2018-10-08 16:36:31 Motors tend to cause the rope to freak out and fling your aircraft everywhere
help 2018-10-08 16:39:20 Idealy, you want your centre of life (blue orb) to be behind the centre of mass (yellow orb)
help 2018-10-08 16:39:33 So the plane wants to fly upwards
help 2018-10-08 16:39:57 Also seems that most of your weight in the form of engines are conecentrated in the back making it rather unstable
bug-reports 2018-10-09 13:00:44 I don't think the data limit can be changed
bug-reports 2018-10-09 13:00:55 It is a *limit* after all
bug-reports 2018-10-09 22:12:23 You lose all control over the engines if an engine falls into the abyss
bug-reports 2018-10-09 22:17:02 I was getting that glitch for a while and only now have I found the source of it
bug-reports 2018-10-09 22:17:29 https://youtu.be/Oh2UlDCPl0M
bug-reports 2018-10-09 22:34:50 Its whenever an engine is dropped off the map and despawns

help 2018-10-09 23:29:33 On the wings?

help 2018-10-12 23:08:41 1x2 is more round, but will mean less space for the interior
help 2018-10-12 23:08:50 1x3 is less round but will allow more space for the interior
help 2018-10-12 23:12:48 Its the best I can do with the limited amount of blocks
help 2018-10-13 13:02:13 Does this look like a GEnx engine?

help 2018-10-13 13:25:03 Having the centre of lift behind your centre of mass makes it easier to get airborne
help 2018-10-13 13:25:28 ?
help 2018-10-13 13:25:32 Looping?
help 2018-10-13 13:25:50 Could be weight or lift inbalance
help 2018-10-13 13:25:58 Could you send a screenshot of your creation?
help 2018-10-13 13:27:32 You probably don't want your centre of lift to be that far back
help 2018-10-13 13:27:34 Just slightly
help 2018-10-13 13:27:44 About half a block or so
help 2018-10-13 13:29:13 Still needs to be moved forward more
help 2018-10-13 13:29:28 Or delete some blocks up front
help 2018-10-13 13:31:09 Yes
help 2018-10-13 13:31:38 I'd place 2 in the front and 2 in the rear
help 2018-10-13 13:32:03 Its all recommended that you have a second wing in the back so you have control over your plane's pitch (up and down movement)
help 2018-10-13 13:32:49 No
help 2018-10-13 15:48:18 Balance
help 2018-10-13 16:36:14 Is the wing flex too much or just about right?

help 2018-10-13 17:30:26 Haven't really worked with magnets much
bug-reports 2018-10-14 13:37:05 Saving and loading take an extremely long time
bug-reports 2018-10-14 13:39:13 I'm trying to resave my 787 but its not saving at all
bug-reports 2018-10-14 13:41:01 I've been waiting here for a whole minute and it still hasen't been saved
bug-reports 2018-10-14 13:50:49 It would be nice to know when it would time out instead of just being given nothing
bug-reports 2018-10-14 13:51:31 Literally any creation that's over 1000 blocks will refuse to save
bug-reports 2018-10-14 13:51:41 Imperial is also struggling to save his sub
bug-reports 2018-10-14 13:52:01 4/10 update
bug-reports 2018-10-14 13:53:22 Honestly think its just worth reverting all the save data changes you made
bug-reports 2018-10-14 13:53:33 Its not worth the 40% of data saved
bug-reports 2018-10-14 13:55:45 Game is literally unplayable right now
bug-reports 2018-10-14 13:56:12 Delete aircraft button is glitched
bug-reports 2018-10-14 13:56:32 Deletes the creation, but the centre of mass and lift are still there and the UI is stuck
bug-reports 2018-10-14 13:56:39 nvm
bug-reports 2018-10-14 13:56:45 But it hangs there for longer than usual
bug-reports 2018-10-14 14:10:39 I vote for revert
bug-reports 2018-10-14 14:11:44 Yes
bug-reports 2018-10-14 14:11:50 Revert painting back to what it was
bug-reports 2018-10-14 14:12:12 This update has honestly created more bugs than it has fixed
bug-reports 2018-10-15 12:05:24 It would be helpful to have a version number somewhere in the GUI so we know whether or not we're in an updated server
bug-reports 2018-10-15 12:07:14 I know, but in a future update
bug-reports 2018-10-15 18:16:00 ?
bug-reports 2018-10-15 18:16:17 Think you may be talking about the sound easter egg
bug-reports 2018-10-15 18:16:31 Has a rare chance of playing that sound rather than the normal sound
bug-reports 2018-10-15 18:18:45 Its not a bug its a feature™
help 2018-10-15 18:39:54 Engines
help 2018-10-15 18:57:05 Propeller blades?
help 2018-10-15 18:57:07 Yeah use motors
help 2018-10-15 18:57:44 I'd probably use a combination of unpowered motors and engines to power them though as powered motors spinning at a high rate of speed tend to glitch out a lot
the-dump 2018-10-16 21:48:23 When you get your community to make updates and get frustrated about bugs for you:
bug-reports 2018-10-16 22:04:58 Arena doesn't work if your plane has a block that was added after September 1st
bug-reports 2018-10-16 22:05:09 i.e, every block added after the helium block was introduced

help 2018-10-26 00:05:06 There are many ways to make ladders:

2) basically the same as #1 except flip the wedges upside down
3) use 1x1 wing panels

help 2019-01-24 18:50:05 <@456226577798135808> do you have anything physically locking the wings in place or are you just relying on motor lock?

help 2019-01-24 18:54:07 I think the root cause of the glitching is from the sheer amount of motors you have turning that prop

help 2019-09-19 02:47:16 could be an issue with torque by the looks of it
help 2019-09-19 02:47:43 no
help 2019-09-19 02:47:49 torque created by the main rotor
help 2019-09-19 02:48:32 to simplify; when the main rotor spins, it causes the whole helicopter to spin in the opposite direction of the rotor
help 2019-09-19 02:48:59 usually counteracted by either a counter-rotating rotor setup or a tail rotor
help 2019-09-19 02:49:09 using a tail rotor is much harder to balance out
help 2019-09-19 02:49:54 yes
help 2019-09-19 02:50:16 so uhh
help 2019-09-19 02:50:33 it would appear that the easiest solution to that would be to increase thrust on tail rotor

help 2019-09-19 02:53:50 hmm
help 2019-09-19 02:54:28 try adding a small prop engine to the tail rotor set to a set of keys seperate to the ones you're using to control the rotors
help 2019-09-19 02:54:38 and maybe try throttling that to try and control the torque

bug-reports 2020-03-16 23:52:04 steps to reproduce:

2) place a locked motor on the section that the motor2 actuates
3) spawn in creation, toggle on the motor2 and rotate the motor a bit
4) let the motor lock, this should happen after the motor has locked
bug-reports 2020-03-16 23:52:37 either that or the locked motor causes the motor2 to go backwards

bug-reports 2020-04-21 18:11:21 **KNOWN BUGS/GLITCHES:**
The following are a list of known bugs and glitches that rickje139 is aware of, you do not need to submit a bug report for them.

• Motors and pistons with locking enabled will sometimes not lock in the correct position.
• The "strange sounds" that rarely come from engines are not a bug. It is an intended feature.
• The forced camera perspective upon spawning in your creation is not a bug. This can be disabled by turning off automatic controls on your control panels.
• Blocks with long hitboxes (1x7 beam, huge jet and rocket engines, 1x4 wedges) will sometimes have their hitbox clip through other blocks when in build mode and not allow placement.
• Parachutes can sometimes fling you into the abyss.
• Locked motors in general.
• Locked motors (and sometimes motor2) attached to an anchor block with physics off will not move when the anchor block is anchored.

bug-reports 2020-06-06 05:14:36 also locks when placing control panels with "automatic controls" enabled
reports 2020-06-06 05:33:42 We will be closing <#623337136267067393> for the foreseeable future until we are able to find a better way to handle reports. 

As mentioned before, Plane Crazy currently has only 3 people who possess moderation powers ingame - 2 of which are busy with other projects and aren't able to moderate Plane Crazy. As a result, this basically means that we only have 1 moderator for the entire game. This in turn means that the majority of the reports being submitted here are being completely ignored.

> Why not just add more ingame moderators? 
Myself and the rest of the staff team have brought this up repeatedly with rickje139 who has repeatedly denied our requests for more ingame moderation citing "trust issues."

In the meantime, reports can be filed directly to rickje139. Here is a reminder of what is and is not reportable:

**WHAT IS NOT REPORTABLE**
> Derogatory language use in chat
This should be reported to Roblox using their in-game report abuse feature (esc menu > report). This also applies to verbal abuse and toxicity in chat.

> Copying of creations
Plane Crazy has features to help prevent potential copying of a user's creations. It is recommended that users who do not want their creation to be potentially copied to turn on the `anti-copy blacklist` found in settings.

**WHAT IS REPORTABLE**
• Derogatory language use and offensive symbols **on creations**
• 18+ content **on creations**
• Creations that **intentionally** lag the server such that **it makes the game unplayable**
• Users who exploit such that it gives them an unfair advantage or hinders gameplay for others.

More info on what can be reported can be found in the pinned messages.
