creations-chat 2022-05-30 03:45:33 bruh the entirety of <#504436696021204992> had a mental breakdown after somebody posted a Russian tank with a Z on it and "Glory to Russia" as the caption
why cant people understand that not all people from a certain country are bad. although it is PCC
creations-chat 2022-05-30 03:48:18 He just has patriotism bro calm down

and maybe he's russian idk
i think hes just screwing around and pissing people off
creations-chat 2022-05-30 03:54:25 yeah the minigun or gun looks nice enough and maybe has function
the escape pod doesnt look great and is just a large oversized oval (no offense)
creations-chat 2022-05-30 03:58:07 the problem with this community is that they will downvote something for the slightest mistake
like an exposed motorlock
or if the creation is too big or something like that

First fix the fucking canopy make it entirely clear, please it hurts my eyes, or just redesign it
Second make the fuselage longer 
third male the wings uniform in color or just change the livery 
Fourth, make the wings more angled or farther back
Fifth, add more detail, and shitty egg plane with good afterburners looks horrible
Sixth, fix the engines

creations-chat 2023-03-04 22:40:56 heres something, if you're gonna make something that functions, make the functioning system impresive, not just some motors hooked up, make it so the steering wheel actually has an effect on the steering, cause what you did was put some blocks, cameras, and motors together and called it a day
creations-chat 2023-03-04 22:43:29 you could also just build an impresive looking frame around it, would probably work
creations-chat 2023-03-04 22:52:12 its the fuckin child who lagged out the private server, ghost ping cause i tried to reply to you but it got deleted for a reason

creations-chat 2023-03-12 16:31:15 atleast i have a color
creations-chat 2023-03-13 22:53:15 Are you stupid, they are different, the grey one has vertical stabilizers and no external intake, the grey ones body is also shorter than the wing
creations-chat 2023-03-14 01:33:34 Make canopy more angled
creations-chat 2023-03-14 01:38:08 just push it forward and adjust the angle from there
creations-chat 2023-03-14 01:55:11 Anything that looks like it took 5 minutes, or something such as a block, or a large block, or anything that doesn’t look impressive
creations-chat 2023-03-16 04:33:06 thats not real
creations-chat 2023-03-16 14:07:39 Too blurry for plane crazy, and the contrails don’t look right
creations-chat 2023-03-16 15:15:19 Same
creations-chat 2023-03-17 02:11:09 Much better, add some canopy lines as well
creations-chat 2023-03-17 02:15:07 Trails
creations-chat 2023-03-17 02:22:10 Tbh, if you can’t use trails don’t bother with it, plane crazy doesn’t have anything thin that looks good
creations-chat 2023-03-17 02:25:09 Still ass
creations-chat 2023-03-17 02:37:00 Doesn’t look right, I’d say remove it
creations-chat 2023-03-18 05:15:10 t
creations-chat 2023-03-18 21:30:52 I think theres some exposed lock on the wing

creations-chat 2023-03-28 19:33:44 Well shit
creations-chat 2023-03-28 19:37:19 Ok, the wings are fixed so they look better, cockpit could look a little more streamlined( basically just make it less flat), body could be more round and tube like, elevators and vertical stabilizer should looks less like a triangle and more like the new wing
This better?

creations-chat 2023-04-14 14:28:14 That’s been done a lot
creations-chat 2023-04-14 19:40:39 too big, too simple
this is a good example made by Southern_Pac
creations-chat 2023-04-14 20:09:39 basically you put some cameras under the motor and some blocks over the motor, pretty simple actually, trails and text also work
creations-chat 2023-04-14 20:12:52 my system has more cameras because it cant interfere with the blocks and other stuff
its a bit of a mess but i hope you can understand it

creations-chat 2023-06-23 19:47:42 Guh, move the motor over by one block to the frame, then place blocks on the motor so it is connected
creations-chat 2023-06-23 20:01:30 Suspension
creations-chat 2023-06-23 20:05:10 Tbh make the frame smaller by 1 block on each side (basically so there is a 4 block gap between the wheels and the frame, put a suspension block on the end of the motor that turns the wheel (make it face up) connect the rest of the wheel frame
creations-chat 2023-06-23 20:07:21 There’s a shitty drawing that I made, I’m on a phone so I can do a good drawing (black is wheel, yellow is motor, white is blocks, blue is suspension
