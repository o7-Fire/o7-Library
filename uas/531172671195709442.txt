creations-chat 2020-05-09 17:29:20 Ngl this games community is pretty toxic whenever somebody posts a bad build
creations-chat 2020-05-09 17:54:59 True
creations-chat 2020-05-09 17:55:37 But people go out of their way to downvote those kids builds
creations-chat 2020-05-09 17:56:03 Like bad builds get more downvotes than good builds get upvotes
creations-chat 2020-05-11 17:32:05 Halo Unsc Pillar of Autumn. 7700 blocks, with a full interior. It kinda flies, but only forwards, up, and backwards, and not very consistantly. it isnt the greatest but i thought it was a good halo build

creations-chat 2021-06-29 13:46:44 <@!719073974239363145> DAMNNN, you did an incredible job recreating the loxodon, like itâ€™s literally as accurate as possible. The fact youâ€™re getting so many downvotes doesnâ€™t make sense. However, loxodon is not best destroyer because bad turret placement :troll:
creations-chat 2021-07-11 22:35:12 Holy shit this is incredible, creativity wise
creations-chat 2021-07-11 22:38:58 Like the design is beautiful, as a spaceship design
creations-chat 2021-08-06 14:35:21 <@456226577798135808> looks like a foralkan Starscape ship, itâ€™s got hardpoints and everything lmao
creations-chat 2021-08-06 17:37:54 I see, so like a light cruiser of sorts
creations-chat 2021-08-06 17:47:14 Makes sense
creations-chat 2021-08-13 01:45:01 This place makes no sense
creations-chat 2021-08-21 12:52:14 How the hell does this have 45 downvotes
creations-chat 2021-08-21 12:54:46 It just looks like a fairly well made fighter jet to me idk whatâ€™s so bad about it
creations-chat 2022-01-30 19:27:40 <@!644261445600804894> looks like a 3-dimensional stock image (great build though)
