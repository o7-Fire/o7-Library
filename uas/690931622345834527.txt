help 2021-10-23 22:25:09 it still exists
help 2021-10-23 22:27:10 (the problem is that the door refuses to open, btw.)
help 2021-10-23 23:10:39 the door uses a motor 2 to open, max torque and opens at 75 degrees. the angle uses a locked motor to keep it in that position
bug-reports 2021-10-30 00:53:10 is today National Everything is Broken Day? because Roblox is down, and hyperbot forgot how upvoting and downvoting works. <:thconking:535171057649188865>

creations-chat 2021-11-06 02:43:46 <@456226577798135808> isnt the Blue Comet y'know... ***blue???*** i mean it cant be called blue if its red, they are two opposite colors. literally, blue is red inverted.
creations-chat 2021-11-06 02:46:27 the inverted blue comet <:thoink:657279634563399720>
creations-chat 2021-11-06 02:48:36 go hang out in tornado alley, that'll really do the trick.
creations-chat 2021-11-06 02:51:42 when weathering, i'd say take the original color and subtract between 50-100 then paint. not the best of methods, but it still works.
creations-chat 2021-11-06 02:53:55 considering that i weather them not at all, they look fine to me. i only have 2 weathered builds, and they are weathered a little more than a tank
creations-chat 2021-11-06 02:56:25 i also chose 50-100 bc i forgot the numbers i actually use
creations-chat 2021-11-06 02:58:45 looks kinda like moss
creations-chat 2021-11-13 05:55:57 pardon my lack of trophy truck knowledge but i think either the top of the truck is too tall or the bed is too short (in height). maybe add an extra cylinder or two on the wheels to make them more accurate
creations-chat 2021-11-13 05:59:25 maybe use this for reference
creations-chat 2021-11-13 06:01:50 shouldn‚Äôt be too hard to match. extending is easy, but its the extra wheels is where the issues might occur.
creations-chat 2021-11-13 06:04:04 1-2 blocks should do it
creations-chat 2021-11-13 06:12:17 much more accurate
creations-chat 2021-11-13 06:18:01 buildings mostly. i suck at planes and trains. *that or i‚Äôll work on another build i have that needs work*
creations-chat 2021-11-13 06:24:32 its actually more complex than it looks. it has a full meltdown sequence, with a lockdown implemented. parts fall (including the sign) others explode, and one of the floors collapses. the logo is on top and folds into position, along with an incredibly long pole with a light at the end and the parking lot. i‚Äôm not in pc rn and this is a 13k block creation so its not loaded in. *the logos on the top are other companies that Bus Co. is allied with* ~~it was also designed to be a giant bus~~
creations-chat 2021-11-14 03:48:31 <@!639374429532717056> you are taking ‚Äòpotato mode‚Äô very literal
creations-chat 2021-11-14 04:04:44 what is it with you and food?

it used to be there but rickje must‚Äôve removed it.
creations-chat 2021-11-21 05:23:46 nah it was a guy who posted a friend‚Äôs build

creations-chat 2021-11-26 05:56:37 the things that we do here
creations-chat 2021-11-26 06:02:13 quick question. WHY DO YOU GUYS HATE NIGHT PICTURES SO MUCH
creations-chat 2021-11-26 06:07:03 perhaps i could make an artificial moon, since the only working lights are the ones on the bus. which is over 50 years old. (there are literally no lights whatsoever in Bus Stop Simulator. the nearest one is the disco ball in Blox Donald's.)
creations-chat 2021-11-26 06:10:23 i literally tried to get the lighting bug so i could get something out of the dark pics. nope. nothing changed.
creations-chat 2021-11-26 06:32:24 lower the brightness maybe? (there aren't supposed to *be* any lamp posts. that's why it was so dark to begin with.)
creations-chat 2021-11-26 06:37:13 yeah adjusting the brightness did nothing. i'll just have to lower it carefully then.
creations-chat 2021-11-26 06:48:50 i suggest using waterwheels for fans, although they are made of wood they look pretty good. not if you set them to toggle <:thoink:657279634563399720>
creations-chat 2021-11-26 06:51:13 there *isss* a bug that they still slow down with toggle, but its at random.
creations-chat 2021-11-26 07:03:09 dont intend on changing and/or posting this, just thought i'd throw it out there for a little help. also, the PCC is harsh on bad builds. diamond plate platforms are blast covers for the windows, and the blast doors are obvious. also has a full meltdown sequence.
creations-chat 2021-11-26 07:05:11 Fun Fact: screenshot number for 2nd image is #69 <:trollface:775024642104229898>
creations-chat 2021-11-26 07:09:28 full info: the core section of the facility is located underground (despite the giant window saying otherwise, that's just the core chamber.) it has a full meltdown sequence, falling parts, etc. blast doors and covers are functional, has a working elevator, safegaurd, and eye-removing explosion. top floor in the image is the generator room, middle is the control, and lowest is coolant. ~~also, i forgot to paint the center of the ceiling fans. ~~ <--- that's bad. really bad.
creations-chat 2021-11-26 07:16:45 *~~let this be a good lesson to not say things~~*
creations-chat 2021-11-26 07:18:57 i was tossed in front of a train when i first started posting

creations-chat 2021-11-28 05:41:29 the stern on my ship uses a bunch of wedge blocks, triangle wedges, and regular wedges. it's more complex than it looks and it hurt my brain to do. same follows for under the bow, which can't quite be seen.

*(side notes: the siren is in fact the original siren, and the engine and horn are from Cadillacs. Cleanin' Up the Town is on the radio, along with the montage from the original movie.)* https://streamable.com/7zpmwl
*(2nd side note, there have been some slight modifications since the last <#384025409945337856> upload but they were too small to mention. ~~also i forgot what they were.)~~*

creations-chat 2023-03-28 22:52:34 hate to break it to you, but we're all pretty fucking sick of seeing shitty builds and more shitty builds that break the rules.

you may think you're funny, but you're not.
you may think that just because it isnt directly stated in the rules it's allowed, but it's not.

have some fucking common sense, all of you.

what you're saying is the equivalent of "i'm black so i can say the word starting with the letter n"

it doesn't matter where you're from or what ethnicity you are, race means nothing in this server, it's irrelevant, and it's against the rules.

and, fun fact: Germans don't even like that symbol.

creations-chat 2023-06-10 04:06:27 1. we aint resparking the game until we get pc2

2. stick to guides, they teach more than tutorials do.

3. people will learn better designs as they progress over time, it's not like they'll be stuck as a shitty builder unless they do a tutorial
creations-chat 2023-06-10 04:09:55 one of many issues.

<@396515096693833729> and another thing about reviving the game, it can't be done because it's constantly breaking more and more. players will stop playing even if we get them to start because plane crazy is beginning to be unplayable

i'm on the little to no good builds anymore team <:verycool:755817509567070351>
creations-chat 2023-07-17 21:02:09 effort and build quality are not the same thing

around the time when i first joined (mid 2021) there was pretty much a consistent flow of good builds.

as 2022 rolled in more whitenames and newer members started joining and so the quality of builds went down

that doesn't mean that there **aren't** good builds, just not that many as there used to be.

(also note that the people saying that there arent any good builds in creations are also older pcc members who were around when there were better builds)
