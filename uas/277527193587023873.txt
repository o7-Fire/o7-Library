creations-chat 2019-03-27 08:23:24 Name: RY - C
Type: Low speed, maneuverable jet
Features: Funtions normally as intended, Basic front VTOL is used to help with takeoff, but only works at 60 speed
Description: This slightly ugly jet was made to be more maneuverable than stylish, the purpose of building this was to have a plane that can go at moderate speeds without rockets, since they are notorious for lagging.
Result: 200 speed, lightning fast movements, no screaming kids throwing their mom's crappy laptop out the window due to lag

creations-chat 2019-03-28 08:32:22 My first drone
Features: Lateral movements assisted with jet engines (only forward and back, tilts)
Functionality: Slow, heavy drone which may turn into a tiny fortress in the near future, will need to change motors out tho.

Thoughts?
creations-chat 2019-04-01 00:31:51 Rear
btw the engines can do a full 360 degree rotation and can pivot up or down
the fins in the rear stabilize turning

creations-chat 2019-04-06 02:44:39 WASP - 32B
This is a jet rocket hybrid that is design to takeoff on water, kinda like a boat.
Open front engine design with a huge jet in the rear. if someone tells me its a batmobile i swear to ConConinos (dont ban)

Top speed: roughly 500 MPH

Triple jet design, two larges and one huge.

creations-chat 2019-04-06 02:51:34 i dont know if my creations are role worthy. we need a locked channel explaining them
creations-chat 2019-04-06 02:51:45 nvm
creations-chat 2019-04-06 02:51:56 i just feel like it is too unknown

creations-chat 2019-04-17 02:20:37 Kraken V2
Designed for speed, pardon the canard.
Top speed: 595
This is a much improved version of my first half decent rocket powered plane, this one not being nearly as laggy.
Very snappy controls.
creations-chat 2019-04-17 02:20:52 
creations-chat 2019-04-17 02:24:42 UPDATE: minor engine fix increased speed to a stable 600
creations-chat 2019-04-17 02:47:03 That plane needs some nerfing. It's too good
creations-chat 2019-04-17 03:43:40 sorry for posting this yet again, but i made the top flatter and added a long stabilizer. im not gonna self upvote this time.
creations-chat 2019-04-18 23:59:54 Yeah I should probably make another VTOL plane
creations-chat 2019-04-19 00:00:19 Not that I'm gonna copy I just got the idea after looking at yours
the-dump 2019-04-21 20:04:49 
creations-chat 2019-04-21 20:30:37 No name for this new plane.
Top speed is 156 while remaining stability and maneuvers
dont think this is role worthy tho
creations-chat 2019-04-21 20:31:08 
creations-chat 2019-04-22 03:48:54 i made another plane today with no name either.
Top speed is shown
440 parts or something.
best part? no lag and no hidden engines. The only engines is motorized props with 4 speeds
creations-chat 2019-04-22 03:49:32 what roles can this give?
creations-chat 2019-04-22 03:49:50 was wrong about parts lol

creations-chat 2019-04-25 01:11:38 twin prop passenger plane

creations-chat 2019-05-19 08:29:48 that twin prop plane i made last month that took around 2 days (i build slow) is apparenty great in anyone's eyes except for anyone in this discord. people have to be an expert to acomplish anything i guess
