creations-chat 2022-06-29 11:43:41 But skilled might be an overstatement, because during the building phase especially the windshields, they had to use motorlock and i just discovered how basic motorlocking works, hence this is by far my first truly motorlocked build

creations-chat 2022-06-30 00:00:56 Yes yes indeed, i never decline people who want to learn, just make sure you know you are able to make it, else people who make the "substitute" Of my wheel without asking for permission tend to butcher the shape of the wheel and bring shame to my name, very sorry about my strict policy, but it's to encourage others to believe in themselves, i might make a tutorial about it soon, i could take public opinion whether or not
creations-chat 2022-06-30 00:06:27 I mean its more to a trust the process build because you could build them subconsciously, although slight disclaimer, each wheels are almost 300 blocks!

believe me or not, the bot actually works 0.5% of the time to recognize whether or not it is a non-plane crazy-related build and will issue a warn as well as delete the said creation, the bot of which provides us with downvote and upvote buttons, which still break at least five times a month doing a very simple thing <:trollface:775024642104229898>, hence we can't really afford to let some bozo (4th count as of now, i witnessed two only) just spam nsfw images and unrelated images, and it is simply to just clarify that whitenames will not last long if they are an underaged delinquent within this server as their actions are discriminatory against them
