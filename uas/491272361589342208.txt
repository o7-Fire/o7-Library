creations-chat 2022-06-03 17:17:15 Yes some Italian regions do too, <@719168864705052802> there is no such French food that reached Pizza, the most famous types of pastas, Lasagne and ton of other foods, these foods are the most ate food in the world while who tf eats baguettes and chocolate isn't only yours come on, also don't say a few undreds different dishes because you make Italian cuisine feel big in comparision
creations-chat 2022-06-03 17:21:31 Subway is world wide known? It only exists in a few countries, while Pizza is the dish which reached further than any others, <@567763933952475157> If you say cheese is an ingredient of pizza you don't know what Pizza is

creations-chat 2022-06-17 14:48:12 Yeah and as a guy who knows a lot about it I can tell you that in a BVR engagment the F22 Is still better than the Rafale, the Rafale wasn't made to be an interceptor or an air superiority fighter even if it's capable of that, It was rather made to be a multirole fighter

creations-chat 2022-06-17 15:14:35 China hasn't been just coping, most of China's fighter jets troughout the modern history were Russian jets, J11 was just a repainted and modified Su-27 same as the J15 = (Su 33)

creations-chat 2022-06-21 15:24:41 If you scroll up you'll see what off topic really is, <@765318482753224704> That's correct flaps basically increase the air force below your wings so you can takeoff shorter than without flaps <@883063424614006878> Idk why but I think you're just mad you don't have a decent pc to play dcs <@416152900960780290> are you Italian by any chance?

creations-chat 2022-06-24 14:14:10 Fuel thirsty ass plane
creations-chat 2022-06-24 14:22:26 The problem Is that a 1800 thousand block fighter jet will never get in hall of fame so It you won't get master rank, I think they should remove the thing that you have to go in hall of fame to get master rank because we only see 1 build every month go into hof so it's tok difficult to get master rank
creations-chat 2022-06-25 05:50:53 Most? 15 percent of phones are waterproof

Only high-end phones are waterproof if you compare this number to the rest of medium end and low end phones you'll find that the majority isn't waterproof, especially if you take in consideration the most sold brand Xiaomi and other brands, Google phones aren't famous at all in fact they suck ass.
creations-chat 2022-06-26 05:41:37 Yeah It seems the same
creations-chat 2022-06-26 08:30:24 Depends in the first picture It shows what I think of a Mig 29A, in the last It shows Mig-29SMT a modernized version of the mig-29S better know by the west as the Mig-29C, there only noticable difference from the A to the SMT, the spine in the SMT Is bigger and longer as the SMT variant holds more fuel even more than the S version which had a bigger spine than the A version but not as big as the SMT version

creations-chat 2022-06-27 20:44:26 I won't respect a human being trying to resemble an animal, I won't harm him but there's nothing that stops me from cussing at him
creations-chat 2022-06-27 20:52:42 I know bulling Is bad but in a society where a fat person doesn't get admired for his beauty, furrys behaviour isn't accepted into society, where the weak isn't chased Is a good society, nowdays society Is normalizing being obese, it's normalizing weak man, it's normalizing  abnormal behaviours.
creations-chat 2022-06-27 20:54:53 Is this too political? Maybe I'll eliminate it
creations-chat 2022-06-27 21:00:43 Seems cool then we can change the rules to get to master rank

creations-chat 2022-06-29 14:58:46 These military kids thinking they know something about aircrafts, F-35 hasn't the best air-to-air combat capabilities, the f-22 has better manouvrability than the F16 even if the F16 has better manouvrability out of the F18 or the F14 generally speaking.

creations-chat 2022-06-29 15:14:56 The majority of times the A-10 doesn't use his gun to destroy his targets, the A-10 Is designed for aerial ground support, It doesn't Need to be fast or stealth, the A-10 isn't designed to go against air defenses, the A-10 Is a God in close support, It showed It in many wars
creations-chat 2022-06-29 15:26:25 üíÄAgain bruh I just told the A-10 was designed for ground support, It needs to be able to take hits
creations-chat 2022-06-29 16:58:05 Nicer but rework the nose, the cockpit , also if you see an F-16 you Will see how's the space beetween the nose and the intake because it's not Just flat

creations-chat 2022-07-16 22:40:56 Let's keep the standard to have a shaped and healthy body high, now I'll do the second round
creations-chat 2022-07-16 22:45:09 In general fat acceptance Is rising in this society full of comforts, people can sit behind a screen and say things they would never say face to face, in general having a good body is gradually becoming less useful in modern society which I found absurd, so let me go with a second round of push-ups
creations-chat 2022-07-16 22:51:40 Yep <@706717603258957864> bro that's the Indian Fighter Typhoon from 7/11
creations-chat 2022-07-16 22:55:11 That's pretty easy the difficult part Is to angle lock the back part which goes down and sideways at the same time, It took me two days of full work for that part
creations-chat 2022-07-16 22:57:13 People used to try to look good back then to fit in society, to work to have friends, now you can have "friends" behind a screen, work behind a screen that's what I mean for becoming less useful and idk if you have noticed how I am against everything that accepts being fat

creations-chat 2022-07-17 07:58:59 You said the common phrase "Do you have anything against people who aren't american?" trying to make me sound racist, unfortunately you didn't know that I wasn't American either<:trollface:775024642104229898>
creations-chat 2022-07-17 08:04:53 You said "Any problems with being Latin American?" "I don't have to know English just because i'm on a server", you thought I was American or from the UK a native english speaker and that me saying you barely speak English to you was very offensive so you had to make me sound racist unfortunately I'm not a native English speaker too <@723940197456281640> Sorry where are you from?
