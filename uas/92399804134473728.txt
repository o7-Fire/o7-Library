creations-chat 2018-11-30 06:48:17 Pretty well. The only thing is landing it. XD
creations-chat 2018-11-30 06:48:33 Other than landing it is really smooth.
creations-chat 2018-11-30 06:49:48 üëå
creations-chat 2018-11-30 06:49:56 Yeah
creations-chat 2018-11-30 15:31:05 I experimented with basically everything except for PVP stuff on my first day. I love building mechanical things. Awesome AT-AT btw.

creations-chat 2018-11-30 18:39:11 Oh. For some reason I was thinking of the Halo Warthog.
creations-chat 2018-11-30 18:39:13 XD
creations-chat 2018-11-30 18:39:36 Awesome.

creations-chat 2018-11-30 21:30:18 My plane?
creations-chat 2018-11-30 21:30:43 I haven't posted a plane here in a while.
creations-chat 2018-11-30 21:30:45 Lol.
creations-chat 2018-11-30 21:31:04 I haven't even attempted it yet.
creations-chat 2018-11-30 21:31:37 My largest build was able to fit in the build zone so I haven't needed it.
creations-chat 2018-11-30 21:32:27 Oh.
creations-chat 2018-11-30 21:32:36 You can probably do a piston lock.
creations-chat 2018-11-30 21:33:53 Just make a piston push a block or two at the point where it starts to swing open.
creations-chat 2018-11-30 21:34:12 So it can't swing open.
creations-chat 2018-11-30 21:34:35 Idk.
creations-chat 2018-11-30 21:34:56 I use it to keep my plane's cargo door from swinging down.
creations-chat 2018-11-30 21:35:15 Pretty simple.
creations-chat 2018-11-30 21:36:26 I started playing like this week I think. But I have experimented a lot.
creations-chat 2018-11-30 21:36:37 Lol
creations-chat 2018-11-30 21:37:30 Awesome.
creations-chat 2018-11-30 21:37:42 The first large scale build was a submarine.
creations-chat 2018-11-30 21:38:01 About a 1000 blocks I believe.
creations-chat 2018-11-30 21:38:20 Not too big. But big for my standards at the time. üòÇ
creations-chat 2018-11-30 21:39:01 Yeah underwater is so hard to move with submarines.
creations-chat 2018-11-30 21:40:52 Wow.
creations-chat 2018-11-30 21:41:11 My biggest build currently is 1660 something blocks.
creations-chat 2018-11-30 21:41:18 Lol
bug-reports 2018-12-02 03:28:46 Not sure if this is a bug or something I a doing wrong, or maybe it was intentional who knows? But when using magnets, the toggle doesn't really seem to work. Could be a range thing however. When I repel the magnets (My settings: Max Range, Max Strength, Toggle On, Magnets Only, Weld On) and weigh one down so it doesn't fly off the other just doesn't stop when I toggle it off. It continues in that direction forever. Even if you block it, once the obstacle is removed it will continue fly off.
creations-chat 2018-12-03 04:09:03 I made a railgun. XD

creations-chat 2018-12-03 21:18:06 My first build was trash. XD
help 2018-12-03 21:19:43 You could use a piston lock possibly to keep them from not moving.
help 2018-12-03 21:20:12 Above and under the wing.
help 2018-12-03 21:20:33 It will stop it from flinging up and down like that.
creations-chat 2018-12-03 21:21:46 With what?
creations-chat 2018-12-03 21:21:51 Looks fine.
creations-chat 2018-12-03 21:22:01 Just add wedges.
creations-chat 2018-12-03 21:22:05 To smooth it out.
creations-chat 2018-12-03 21:22:53 Don't compare yours to other peoples.
creations-chat 2018-12-03 21:22:55 Lol.
creations-chat 2018-12-03 21:23:02 Just look at it as a whole.
creations-chat 2018-12-03 21:23:56 Adding wedges to the bottom to smooth it out will make it look a 100x better.
creations-chat 2018-12-03 21:24:03 And coloring it.
creations-chat 2018-12-03 21:24:14 I think it look really good though.
creations-chat 2018-12-03 21:31:18 Yeah

creations-chat 2018-12-04 00:01:01 Yeah
creations-chat 2018-12-04 00:01:19 Just would be hard to control.
creations-chat 2018-12-04 00:01:38 Depending on the speed of the plane.
creations-chat 2018-12-04 00:01:49 Yeah
creations-chat 2018-12-04 00:02:53 Pretty smart.
creations-chat 2018-12-04 00:08:05 If you use magnets and helium you can get 400k really fast.. :D

creations-chat 2018-12-04 04:22:05 I usually only use propellers for turning on two different types of builds. Things that are super heavy or planes that go over the 300 to 350 range.
creations-chat 2018-12-04 04:22:29 And I always have them set to On/Off Mode.
creations-chat 2018-12-04 04:24:51 Anything below about 300, with enough flight controls should be pretty easy to turn.

help 2018-12-05 04:16:16 Not enough lift, or too much weight in the front.
help 2018-12-05 15:30:00 Well you haven't given people time. XD
help 2018-12-05 15:31:37 What is the problem?
help 2018-12-05 15:31:54 <@376019740310634497>
help 2018-12-05 15:32:21 Is it just not moving?
help 2018-12-05 15:32:30 Or falling forward?
help 2018-12-05 15:32:36 Hmm..
help 2018-12-05 15:32:49 Needs front lift.
help 2018-12-05 15:32:52 I can't.
help 2018-12-05 15:32:57 I'm at school. XD
help 2018-12-05 15:33:45 Like wings in the front or a propeller engine facing upward hidden in the front of the plane.
help 2018-12-05 15:34:09 It looks like it would be very front heavy.
help 2018-12-05 15:34:18 The wings are in the back.
help 2018-12-05 15:34:27 Which is fine.
help 2018-12-05 15:34:40 But you need to add some upward force in the front.
help 2018-12-05 15:35:40 Well I have to go. You can probably get someone else's help if my suggestion doesn't work.
help 2018-12-05 16:22:24 I'm back
help 2018-12-05 16:24:01 Ok.
help 2018-12-05 16:24:29 Yeah, usually it is too much weight compared to speed or not enough lift.
bug-reports 2018-12-05 16:24:37 Dang
help 2018-12-05 16:25:05 So what is your problem now?
help 2018-12-05 16:26:53 Can't watch the video now.
help 2018-12-05 16:27:07 But you can probably turn on the lock option on motors.
help 2018-12-05 16:28:07 Oh.
help 2018-12-05 16:28:52 It should be pretty easy.
help 2018-12-05 16:29:04 Just give me a second to think it through.
help 2018-12-05 16:29:47 Np.
help 2018-12-05 16:30:28 Look at the folding tutorial in <#501034677793193994>
help 2018-12-05 16:30:57 And then just add locking to the motors to keep it in the position.
help 2018-12-05 16:31:44 Since I can't watch the video not sure if that's what you want.
help 2018-12-05 16:32:09 Sure.
help 2018-12-05 16:33:39 Oh.
help 2018-12-05 16:33:45 The vertical stabilizers?
help 2018-12-05 16:34:19 That is pretty simple I believe.
help 2018-12-05 16:35:13 Just attach them to the top of the motors rotating part.
help 2018-12-05 16:36:00 And then add the locking to the motors.
help 2018-12-05 16:36:13 And reverse the keybinds for one of the motors.
help 2018-12-05 16:37:31 That way the motors rotate outwards.
help 2018-12-05 16:38:41 Yeah
help 2018-12-05 16:40:01 What happens?
help 2018-12-05 16:40:25 Ok.
help 2018-12-05 16:41:26 Np.
help 2018-12-05 17:23:34 You would need to add a block.
help 2018-12-05 17:23:48 Like replace a wing panel with a block.
help 2018-12-05 17:24:01 Or half block.
help 2018-12-05 17:24:11 And then attach the rocket it that.
