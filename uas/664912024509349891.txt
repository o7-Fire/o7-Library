creations-chat 2023-02-16 18:46:44 I like croatia
creations-chat 2023-02-17 21:02:51 what is bad with white name
creations-chat 2023-02-19 17:06:59 what do you mean?
creations-chat 2023-02-19 17:10:19 it is not a tut build i built it all on myself
that just looks very similar i promise on god i built it myself
do you want me to show a pic of it in my building area to prove i built it
creations-chat 2023-02-19 17:13:15 no but the building area will look different since i built it myself
waiting for cooldown to send pic
basically you follow the tutorial you get the same plot but mine may look the same motorlocked but if i havent motorlocked his unmotorlocked build will look different to mine
creations-chat 2023-02-19 17:15:30 skip to end of tut and it will most likely look nothing like this
what is wtv
plus you are looking at trapdoor wings that just help with manouverability, someone told me about them before i knew who namnam was
creations-chat 2023-02-19 17:18:18 i didnt follow any namnam guides for this build bruh the only issue you guys see is trapdoor wings
creations-chat 2023-02-19 17:21:27 can you guys atleast just tell me what to do to improve rather than berating me over an apparant tut build
creations-chat 2023-02-19 17:26:49 on the model i used they bulged up
creations-chat 2023-02-19 17:29:41 it is my build
creations-chat 2023-02-19 17:32:54 i just use models and that looks just like the model i followed i dont get it
creations-chat 2023-02-19 17:37:15 what do i have to do to make my builds better, all you guys say is just make it look like the actual thing when im following the model
creations-chat 2023-02-19 17:53:09 what do people dislike about the a3 and the eurofighter?
you guys will ridicule a build over sizing, I just prefer that size and have always built in that size, plus I dont watch namnam and I dont see what's wrong with them
creations-chat 2023-02-19 17:58:56 1 wide jets is scaled to the roblox character, hence the name roscale, so therefore it is the correct size for a jet. a for the a3, it is a bigger plane so i decided to upscale it to 2 half blocks each side, so, that is also roscale

people literally call it roscale, plus ik fighter jets are massive and i have done the scaling to a roblox character and it is a normal size, if size is the only thing you will hate on i will take it that my build is fine
creations-chat 2023-02-19 18:05:37 have you ever scaled it
creations-chat 2023-02-19 18:08:02 everytime anyone ridicules my build ingame its always that its roscale
i have also scaled it to my roblox character and its 1 wide, but it doesnt matter the size i dont know why i just get downvotes
creations-chat 2023-02-19 18:10:17 i scaled my builds to height not to width because roblox characters are unnecessarily wide
creations-chat 2023-02-19 18:12:55 i mean i did that on my a3 and i still get downvoted
creations-chat 2023-02-19 18:15:39 what makes it so bad then?
bro we are past the sizing, what actaully makes it look bad
creations-chat 2023-02-19 18:22:44 can we get past that because i thought 1 block was roscale after multiple people telling me
i wasnt arguing i just dont want people insulting me and i prefer actual feedback over say 'its shit' 'everything is bad'
creations-chat 2023-02-19 18:26:13 why is everyone so harsh on here? im trying to improve my building skills and people do nothing but hate, the bombs do work and they are pvp planes for performance

hes not being very nice just calling it shit too just calling specific bits shit, not telling me how to improve
creations-chat 2023-02-19 18:30:16 its just my only builds, sorry guys i will build a jet that isnt pvp soon and please give proper feedback next time and dont be so rude pls
creations-chat 2023-02-19 22:55:49 what block did you use for the thrusters
creations-chat 2023-02-23 01:10:38 how is this start
creations-chat 2023-02-23 01:22:29 i think its fine because hes only making it fly i think the looks are done thats all that matters right
creations-chat 2023-02-23 01:33:16 he says working on getting it to fly not necessarily working on the looks
creations-chat 2023-02-23 03:56:28 what do you think of progress
creations-chat 2023-02-23 05:08:52 is f18 not finished so hard to tell
creations-chat 2023-02-23 17:37:42 does this look like f18 wings? if not tell me whats wrong
creations-chat 2023-02-23 17:42:57 on sketchfab just says f18
creations-chat 2023-02-23 17:45:36 im only talking about the wings and wingspan and that im getting onto the other parts just wondered if the wings looked accurate
creations-chat 2023-02-23 17:51:21 does the wings look accurate then
creations-chat 2023-02-23 17:58:23 this is better?
