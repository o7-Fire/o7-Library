creations-chat 2022-04-23 16:42:05 Yeah, i intended it to, inter war designs meant to look as crazy as hell
creations-chat 2022-04-23 16:45:11 I just think early/inter war aircrafts look cool, cause it gives the experimental vibes, a vacation from all those jets and fighters you see in creation
Not in for the votes
creations-chat 2022-04-23 16:46:57 just want to occasionally share some of my designs jeez chill
creations-chat 2022-04-23 16:55:30 smh do i need to write a disclaimer of every design choice i made for the plane
basically, it's inspired by the Stipa-Caproni mixed with Grumman's series of aircraft.
I want to create a barrel shaped aircraft with space for people. Eventually i added a turret at the rear.
Just like most 1920 aircraft designs, the cockpit is opened and position at the very top for better visibility.
After that, I sorted out the engine by creating a concave shield and fitting a small giant propeller.
I intended not to use a synthetic propeller because I want the overal design to reflect an underpowered feel.
creations-chat 2022-04-23 16:57:44 I've been here for a year, I know how toxic it is, but yeah just tryna explain the design thinking of what I built
creations-chat 2022-04-23 17:06:20 smh don't start a creation war out of me explaining design choices

creations-chat 2022-04-24 16:49:48 No, I don't want to use some super rocket engine to cheat, I rather have the element of challenge and try to work with an engine plant rather than chunk a rocket and have the blue flare come out.

I know it makes the build generally looks cracky, but I love the theme it places

creations-chat 2022-04-24 17:57:04 They build upon request, tips and suggestions. So the fuselage looks the same but everything like engine, wingspan etc is different.

Anyway I probably would stop the design chain to here
creations-chat 2022-04-24 18:02:19 ngl, you should try these things yourself, the community may give some horrendous suggestion, but if you pick the good ones, you can slowly develop.
Just look through the previous designs and see how far it came.
creations-chat 2022-04-24 18:04:03 Build a craft, and let PCC judge it and give you tips
creations-chat 2022-04-24 18:07:40 basically, build a craft, and slowly develop into modern conventions, should give it a try.
creations-chat 2022-04-25 07:29:29 That's the theme
I want a radial engine style plane
All those cool spitfighters you craze are liquid cooled engines
creations-chat 2022-04-25 07:31:16 you get my idea, finally <:thoink:657279634563399720>
creations-chat 2022-04-25 07:33:37 Nah, I sometimes deny some feedback is because it doesn't fit with the general theme.

I think the problem is people just got too satisfied with the Liquid Cooled Planes while I was going for Radial. Ofc, I made statements to try to swing the topic from lc engines to r engines that sounds like I'm angry
creations-chat 2022-04-25 10:45:13 Show me how, draw
creations-chat 2022-04-25 11:26:37 Absolutely the apex of engineering. The ability to merge between 2 forms of transport is mesmerizing. He is able to broker down into the simplest of elements, without the need of motorlock, showing that he is skilled in knowing the game's simplicity and compliment. Those who downvote merely did not grasp the game's mechanics, forcing themselves into motorlocking every feature to satisfy their rectum size. I greatly adore such design and wish many follow his feat of engineering. Those who oppose it must open their eyes and study such technology and enhance their sluggish impractical builds.
creations-chat 2022-04-25 11:36:21 Uncommendable. Colour is the result of imagination. White can represent anything, in this case, he is merely showing off the mechanics, not to dazzle as some cossier or some dessault. Your mere lack of understanding of the simplicity of colour would see your great temptation to downvote. He is not representing any form of vehicle, and thus do not need to paint in it in humorous colours.

creations-chat 2022-04-25 12:00:18 We were joking, child took it as a twitter argument and drag all the way to now, trying to win some form of contest against us

creations-chat 2022-04-25 12:05:47 So you're just 13, respectable, I can excuse your behavior
creations-chat 2022-04-25 12:08:35 Absolutely the apex of engineering. The ability to merge between 2 forms of transport is mesmerizing. He is able to broker down into the simplest of elements, without the need of motorlock, showing that he is skilled in knowing the game's simplicity and compliment. Those who downvote merely did not grasp the game's mechanics, forcing themselves into motorlocking every feature to satisfy their rectum size. I greatly adore such design and wish many follow his feat of engineering. Those who oppose it must open their eyes and study such technology and enhance their sluggish impractical builds.
creations-chat 2022-04-25 12:10:44 True, PCC is more toxic than Phantom Forces
creations-chat 2022-04-25 12:14:08 PCC players when they realize their girl isn't motorlocked and doesn't use a hover engine
creations-chat 2022-04-25 12:18:42 Simple tell them tips
Don't insult them, are you square headed?
creations-chat 2022-04-25 12:20:27 I can show you how to improve as a human being morally.

"I suggest you add more detail to your builds, there is a few form of elements you can add that entice your builds"
creations-chat 2022-04-25 12:22:12 Good for you, learn to be morally appreciative.
You are an "elite". You have the opportunity to help other improve by suggesting.
creations-chat 2022-04-25 12:24:34 You should be nice, you should respect their skills, you should not force them into a field of mere high level and trash them at not able to master as you are.

creations-chat 2022-04-25 12:26:16 See my example, I'm creating a neutral tone, learn to use it. When you grow up and get a job, speech is appreciative to be for mutual bodies.
creations-chat 2022-04-25 12:29:40 I'm respecting your talent, this is a chat for helping, not to show off. Understand the ability to announce your criticism not through violent and egoistic means but through a neutral tone.

Anonymity? bro do you need to not be nice? What is that morality?
creations-chat 2022-04-25 12:31:22 Then get the fuck out and go to contest-chat
creations-chat 2022-04-25 12:33:12 Then show it formally. I don't see you respecting until I started giving you a lecture.
I adore your appreciation of reading my reasoning unlike aftershock, so I forgive you.
creations-chat 2022-04-25 12:34:54 You there, please, be reasonable and not have your antics fight control against you. I know you are prideful, but use it against what? Just give suggestions, though some may be disgruntled, be neutral.
creations-chat 2022-04-25 12:36:37 How do you know you are in your definition "cool"? Ever theorize that word? Tap into your mind, what did you want to be cool, who is the audience? who is the supporters?
Like I say, you're antics are incontrol of you, is best to keep them at bay.
creations-chat 2022-04-25 12:38:19 People call me an orator, I know
So I'm using my skill in oration to reason with you.
creations-chat 2022-04-25 12:40:12 It's alright, as long as you understand my reason and try to enforce it, I'm just here to help correct your antics. Have a nice day ❤️
creations-chat 2022-04-25 12:41:54 john, is never an insult, his language is in a neutral tone, never inserting into an argument like sarcasm, or never aggressively painting as a negative.
I understand your anger, but is not an insult.
creations-chat 2022-04-25 12:48:55 I understand
I was trashed at for building a barrel plane and a radial engine plane simply because it did not suit the conventional thinking of a fighter.
But you do not need to be so aggressive in your words, instead try to exclaim your reasoning by telling them of the design choices of the era in specifical areas.
creations-chat 2022-04-25 12:53:13 Is simply how I give reason, I know it may sound uncanny, but I prefer to impact the audience with a more monotone speech so they can understand the details without having to be enticed by my expression.

creations-chat 2022-04-25 17:39:31 <@732299200624197712> Awesome use of scale, though mind showing the face. Would like to see the full concept of the build. I think people are dissatisfied with you showing the back, but I have to give you massive grants for that Pelvis and Shoulder bone detail! Don't let PCC votes discouraged you, is an excellent build that people just want to see it more materialized!
creations-chat 2022-04-25 17:41:47 <@844852940291702814> Colour scheme, it is essential, I suggest you take a darker tone and more serious wooden texture on the ship. Harness the power of colour, it can make your build look professional. Remember, the votes are not to discourage you, people just think the pattern isn't suited, same for myself
I use a more darker brown for the decks and a more steel blue for the hull, should try it out.
creations-chat 2022-04-25 17:43:34 Try setting all the rest to like 50 based value
Then slightly increase the blue contrast by like 10-20.
Gives a metallic feel!
Plus glass should get a serious tone, like try getting it 60,60,60
creations-chat 2022-04-25 17:45:41 I think the contrasting camo is the one effecting the overall patterns, you should try minimizing the contrast by making both camo patterns closer in values. Make it seem not out of place and more home groom
creations-chat 2022-04-25 17:47:29 Hmm, try adding your specific green you love.
Then try to select a nice variation of it, by setting the values 10 lower (as example). Try and mix until you feel satisfied with the results
creations-chat 2022-04-25 17:49:11 Try adding a slightly lighter/darker shade of green in the mix, it should work.
creations-chat 2022-04-25 17:58:17 <@839451762205392897> Let me help <@393527373729103888> orate his point.

From what he seems, he talks about how your flaps covers your entire wing, try to minimize it with the centre cutting through and making it look like there is variation, viable to your aircraft's ability to fly.
He also talk how the colour looks a bit plain, needs more serious tones like a darker shade to reflect the worn ability of the MiG.
Lastly he talks how the afterburner looks a bit chunky and can add more detail to make it look more streamlined. (Ask him how)
creations-chat 2022-04-25 18:00:05 Buoyancy!!!
Try adding ballast block to stabilize the ship and weighing it down, or if you're daring, enlarge the hull.
creations-chat 2022-04-25 18:01:54 Simply put, he wants your flaps to have variation and not encompass the entire wing.
Add a more serious colour scheme
Make the afterburner less chunky
creations-chat 2022-04-25 18:08:27 NICEEEE

creations-chat 2022-04-30 11:28:05 <@729176170163077130> Nice! I understand the sacrifices you have to make, gives the great depth to your build, a sort of mark to show the development concessions. Sure it doesn't look the best, but you made effort in allowing it to work, eventually you can get into further more beautiful detail!
creations-chat 2022-04-30 11:30:12 <@611882188430114826> Nice submarine! though I think what steals the kilt is the colour, making it more serious tone of blue can get you somewhere further! Remember colour is essential in providing a vibrant build. Hope you improve in controlling your tempo for colours. The overall build look nice
creations-chat 2022-04-30 11:31:54 <@800407883283431444> Looks awesome! I guess people got over saturated with jets and thus they compared your build to a much high standard. Don't let it down, I like your design and build, gives so many teasers.
creations-chat 2022-04-30 11:33:51 <@410585010295275520> I like your overall design except for the cockpit part, it feels let down for the amount of geometry you try to insert for the other parts, maybe have a darker tone for the windows as well as lifting your seat up. Looks a bit clunky, overall it has quite a good potential!
creations-chat 2022-04-30 11:35:44 <@700761272282775593> Awesome!!! Just like retro's jet, felt that the community just got a bit tired of jets thus they compared it to different standard. Don't let it down, I'm a fan of that build!

creations-chat 2022-05-03 09:13:58 I gave him a sliver of hope by talking about his creativity and his adventurism.
I think he was heavily unexpected of how PCC expect builds to be on a high level. 
He is inexperience like me in high-level motorlocking, thus he would be absolutely blown out of the water in creations. Seeing his build, despite heavy and dedicated improvements (yes he upgraded it multiple times) and still flopping was his last straw.

Man dedicated alot of time to improve his build, but PCC ignores and treats it as a triple A contest.
this is what saddens me
creations-chat 2022-05-03 09:16:43 Other things are those self entitled and glorified "critics" which basically gives you no advice but shitting on you. They are a thorn to PCC seriously.
creations-chat 2022-05-03 09:18:50 From what I can infer, is too late to change, PCC's attitude has already bloated up to no return. New players will have to deal with the toxic atmosphere PCC now host.
You can't change the minds of thousand, is irreversible.
Guess PCC is a tale on how a building game community can become super toxic and egotistic.
creations-chat 2022-05-03 09:22:57 There is a fine line between judging. Like I said before, PCC is filled with self entitled critics, who will spit, shit on your builds and expect you to learn from insults.
What I prefer is actual helping.

creations-chat 2022-05-03 09:25:34 True true, just think downvoting should be followed by reasoning.
creations-chat 2022-05-03 09:27:17 He did not beg, he just says is his first vtol, then after many suggestions and tips, he upgraded his build to the current one you see. He just wants to achieve what the community wants, but the community always set the goal post higher

so he just gave up.
creations-chat 2022-05-03 09:28:59 It's a human emotional reaction. If you see your build get disliked, you would want to get it liked. That's his mentality.

Ah I see, alright
creations-chat 2022-05-03 09:31:01 Because it's the actual paint job given
creations-chat 2022-05-03 09:34:43 When you post a creation, you want it to show to the community what you build. Right?
His mentality is just like yours, however he is new. Unlike you, who is an expert, he can only go so far. 
He wants his build to succeed, but it did not.
Sure, there is people like me who shrug off the dislikes, but there is some who feel a more personal attachment, and therefore couldn't cope.

You should learn/ ponder a bit of phycology, it can help shift your view
creations-chat 2022-05-03 09:39:07 I have no interest in roles, I play this game to build, I post in creation to share, and sometimes I give advice I can think of.

Yeah sure, there might be mistakes, but is due to the limitation of the techniques he use, so i'm giving him a thumbsup.

the-dump 2022-05-14 14:18:14 he needs
the-dump 2022-05-14 14:18:34 I can proclaim you to break rule 9, from the entirety of the history of your messages

the-dump 2022-05-14 14:19:22 not clear
the-dump 2022-05-14 14:19:38 I want to see the justification
the-dump 2022-05-14 14:19:48 there is 3-4 different designation
the-dump 2022-05-14 14:19:51 How.
the-dump 2022-05-14 14:20:08 This is the paradox you're creating

the-dump 2022-05-14 14:21:02 the desired context has been removed
the-dump 2022-05-14 14:21:12 it's now merely suggestive
the-dump 2022-05-14 14:21:21 a warn without possible justification
the-dump 2022-05-14 14:21:35 and given with a vague reason
the-dump 2022-05-14 14:21:42 thus one must inquire why?
the-dump 2022-05-14 14:21:44 so I asked
the-dump 2022-05-14 14:22:20 I'm trying to justify
the-dump 2022-05-14 14:22:27 or if some call it lashing out
the-dump 2022-05-14 14:22:47 because of the unfound justification of the warn
the-dump 2022-05-14 14:23:07 thus I laid my questioning, objections and defense
the-dump 2022-05-14 14:23:11 which spiralled into this
