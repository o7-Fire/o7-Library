the-dump 2020-08-08 20:09:02 The missile knows where it is at all times. It knows this because it knows where it isn't. By subtracting where it is from where it isn't, or where it isn't from where it is (whichever is greater), it obtains a difference, or deviation. The guidance subsystem uses deviations to generate corrective commands to drive the missile from a position where it is to a position where it isn't, and arriving at a position where it wasn't, it now is. Consequently, the position where it is, is now the position that it wasn't, and it follows that the position that it was, is now the position that it isn't.
In the event that the position that it is in is not the position that it wasn't, the system has acquired a variation, the variation being the difference between where the missile is, and where it wasn't. If variation is considered to be a significant factor, it too may be corrected by the GEA. However, the missile must also know where it was.

The missile guidance computer scenario works as follows. Because a variation has modified some of the information the missile has obtained, it is not sure just where it is. However, it is sure where it isn't, within reason, and it knows where it was. It now subtracts where it should be from where it wasn't, or vice-versa, and by differentiating this from the algebraic sum of where it shouldn't be, and where it was, it is able to obtain the deviation and its variation, which is called error.

creations-chat 2020-10-10 22:34:03 > Why are you motor locking it sideways
<@456226577798135808> im trying to fit a rocket engine with a height and width with 2 by 2 blocks into a jet engine with a height and width of 3 by 3 blocks
creations-chat 2020-10-10 22:34:53 i also motorlocked vertically
creations-chat 2020-10-10 22:35:09 i did part of it sideways so it's centered
creations-chat 2020-10-10 22:35:26 anyway it works so what's the problem
creations-chat 2020-10-10 22:36:12 ok but that's a rocket engine with a height and width of 3x3
i have a rocket engine with a height and with of 2x2
creations-chat 2020-10-10 22:36:27 <:PogStare:699130318510227537>

<@!273536574770380800> you can just motor lock on some rocket propelled projectiles with disconnectors and bam, you're done
nothing too impressive
creations-chat 2020-10-10 22:47:06 according to that logic

*camo
*basically looks like shit compared to the harrier above

*canopy.

creations-chat 2020-11-28 23:43:07 "camo is real RAF colors"
"custom camo"
dude make up your mind on which camo you wanna use
not only that but the harrier's nose is an abomination as well <@!414359638302130176> 
try motorlock

creations-chat 2020-12-25 15:16:15 <@456226577798135808> not all that bad, but the fuselage is a bit thick, especially at the tail section
the nose is pretty flat, try making it more pointed
and the main wings aren't swept, like on an actual B-52

make it a bit darker
<@!738843958066544663> that cabin has no support and looks like it will collapse at any minute
there's also no way to exit or enter it, aside from climbing the roof
creations-chat 2020-12-26 02:58:29 just set 200 as the red value

<@456226577798135808> your f117 is pretty mediocre, although it's generally true for all stealth planes in plane crazy so there's nothing you can do about it
however there are some improvements to be made, such as this needs to be fixed
creations-chat 2022-05-23 23:14:34 i could at least tell you, so
you should make the top part of the canopy more pointy and angle the intakes
creations-chat 2022-05-23 23:17:47 the challenger was funny but still pretty damn accurate, dont see how anyone could argue about it
creations-chat 2022-05-23 23:22:15 welcome to the club lol

just make the pawns less wide and it should be better
also if you can, hide the magnets under the board

creations-chat 2022-10-09 16:22:10 do you not like russian mbts or smth
ah, alright, i see

i also might replace the tracks with signs and angle them sometime
creations-chat 2022-10-09 16:26:29 it already looks good, small improvement you could make is by replacing the hull mg trail with the water gun block
creations-chat 2022-10-09 17:15:47 i literally cant cover the ones on the turret
it's 1 block tall
also they're a part of the e.r.a, so <a:exquisite:1004241683065610250>

creations-chat 2022-10-09 17:39:58 im not gonna use gold because then it will be too similar to bog's t72 (copying is cringe)
also why would i hide the lock beneath the hatch when there is no room without overcomplicating the turret
