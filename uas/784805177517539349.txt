creations-chat 2021-03-02 17:57:35 Guys, can I show you a dornier do 17m?
creations-chat 2021-03-02 18:00:42 <@!527653676022628353> I don't. It's the m version of the do 17, lol.
creations-chat 2021-03-02 18:05:04 What do you think about this dornier?
creations-chat 2021-03-02 18:07:41 Is my dornier good enough for you?
creations-chat 2021-03-02 18:18:40 Lol, I didn't make that version. It's a special romanian one.
creations-chat 2021-03-02 18:24:35 Ok, but do you like this NMS Elisabeta romanian cruiser? If this 3593 blocks detailed ship is "too small" for you, I think  we don't use the same metric system.
creations-chat 2021-03-02 18:27:35 I can't count, but here I'm on the deck, you can make a comparaison.
creations-chat 2021-03-02 18:29:57 It's about that, but the real thing wasn't gigantic, it's pre ww1. I used 1.5 blocks for 1 m on the ship. I got a friend who made an incredible Ratte, but in smaller scale. Do you only like size? In that case, build a giant block, and post it.
creations-chat 2021-03-02 18:32:23 <@!718006867808485447> Well that means most voters on this server are dumb.
creations-chat 2021-03-02 18:37:00 Well for example, here I made a small but detailed 500+ U-I class submarine from the K.u.K. navy. The real thing was a coastal U-boat and was only 30 bloody meters long. If I'd make it bigger, it would be unrealistic. But I understand that only size, and not historical accuracy metter for votes.
creations-chat 2021-03-02 18:41:57 Do you like this one?
creations-chat 2021-03-02 18:48:23 Eh, ok? Is it good than?
creations-chat 2021-03-02 18:50:49 It was a psychology experiment.
creations-chat 2021-03-02 18:53:16 Yes, I wanted to see how dumb people were.
creations-chat 2021-03-02 18:55:48 Bruh, I wanted to post a submarine but, ok. This server is so toxic anyways.
creations-chat 2021-03-02 18:58:20 Do you at least know if I'll be blacklisted forever on this account <@!690967945165275216> ?
creations-chat 2021-03-02 19:02:07 <@!707133341454958604> Thanks for blacklisting me. You got all the compliments.
creations-chat 2021-03-02 19:05:38 Bruh. I'm new here, how can I possibly know who can blacklist? But I'm leaving anyway, here people only care about the size of builds and this server is so toxic. Just get over it.
creations-chat 2021-03-02 19:10:26 Bruh, I'm not NeW oN tHe GaMe, I'm new on the disc. I got a lot of detailed accurate fucking builds, don't trust me? Join me on the bloody game. And I posted a block, because I wanted to see how fucking dumb voters are here, because I see they only care about one thing; SiZe.

creations-chat 2021-12-05 14:44:20 <@!799381636407099483> Than, stfu, you don't even know what you're talking about.
creations-chat 2021-12-05 14:47:40 <@!799381636407099483> Shut it, noob. You think your first ever ship will beat mine, whatever. Come on, build something better than this in 8 days. Forgot to mention, must be 9000 blocks or more. Go ahead.

help 2022-02-17 18:26:35 Greetings, fellow players. It has come to my attention that locked motors will no longer teleport in Plane Crazy 2. I was wondering if that means that motorlock as we use it now will still work.
creations-chat 2022-03-04 21:24:08 DM me if you wanna see a rocket.
