[LAG NERF] 
[BUILDING] 

[LAG] - Player vs Player is my more favourite game mode, since it has action and I can actually see how good my builds perform. But lately I haven't been able to enjoy this mode as people have been creating massive lag machines. One of the most important blocks in these are parachutes( at least from my current experience). So my suggestion is to significantly nerf the max parachute count. No good build would require more than 20 parachutes.
