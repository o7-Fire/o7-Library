bug-reports 2021-05-24 10:59:56 My smoke pipe in my guided missile emit smoke in the opposite direction(it releases smoke up instead of down). How do you fix this?
creations-chat 2021-05-24 11:04:05 <@!561155604014694400> cool carrier but the stern, port and starboard part is too straight and square
creations-chat 2021-06-11 23:08:15 <@!699494777648971776> looks cute lol

creations-chat 2021-06-24 10:33:00 <@!559568621312147476> thats a nice planee, but the color could be better

creations-chat 2021-06-24 10:37:52 unfunny trolling  <:WeirdChamp:670867805176070145>
creations-chat 2021-06-29 10:30:33 <@!791976765123592233> nice, great and all but the  hangar could have more details
creations-chat 2021-06-29 10:35:01 more details on all sides
bug-reports 2021-07-01 13:22:06 idk if this is a glitch on all clients, or if its just my side (cause my pc is laggy) but smoke pipes seem to emit smoke in the opposite direction, as shown on my missiles
bug-reports 2021-07-01 13:40:09 so its client sided?
creations-chat 2021-07-07 13:54:55 <@!721103577380159490> Pretty decent carrier, could be alot better tho (maybe add more details and lower the hue of your paint job) also make its main flight deck's texture slate. and the bridge's windows are too blue. awesome name for the ship lol
creations-chat 2021-07-08 09:53:06 <@!721103577380159490>  the windows are still too blue üëÅÔ∏èüëÑüëÅÔ∏è 
oh, so thats what u want.. thts nice
creations-chat 2021-10-14 12:48:55 <@!722468929246593134> nice overall, but i think the color job could be better
