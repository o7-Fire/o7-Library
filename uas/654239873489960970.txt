bug-reports 2020-03-14 21:15:06 If you get in a seat on a craft by a player you are blacklisted by, and they teleport back to their base, you get teleported inside the blacklisted plot. Just happened for me there, I think a bug fix is in order.
creations-chat 2020-03-15 17:17:25 Bigger version of the boat I made yesterday. All the same functions, except, this version has Port & Starboard lights, a searchlight, 2 turrets, and an improved turning system, which in turn, makes the craft more stable.

creations-chat 2020-03-25 19:07:09 The newest boat in the Royal Plane Crazy Naval Fleet, the HMS Hamish (named after my late grandfather) is the best ship I've ever made. This large ship has probably the most detailed interior I've ever made, and it took a few days to build.
This warship has 3 decks; the below decks, the main deck, and the bridge. The below decks is fitted with sleeping quarters, a mess hall and a recreational area. The main deck, pictured in the picture below, has 2 guns and a helipad (behind the bridge). The bridge is fitted with 8 computers, the main ship controls, and a captains quarters.
More screenshots are to follow.

creations-chat 2020-04-11 11:57:49 Now Presenting... the Bluebird K7!
Used by the late Donald Campbell to set many water speed records, this boat was Campbell's final resting place after he crashed it trying to go to 300mph in 1967.
However, since 2002, the Bluebird Project team have been restoring this beast of a machine to it's former glory. Then, in 2018, the came to Loch Fad, on the Isle of Bute, to test her out.
I was fortunate enough to know the bailiff of the Loch, and I got to stand next to the Bluebird, and oh my, what an absolute beast she is. The engine was absolutely massive. Everything about it was... amazing, to say the least.
Then, a few days ago, I was going through my old creations when I found an old rendition of the K7. I realised that she looked like a piece of shit, and for the past few days, I've been trying to fix her up and I finally finished.
She has a top speed of 200, about how fast they were running her on Loch Fad. I realise that not every part of it is perfect, but it's the best I could do.
(PS - I realised that the intakes on the top photo are yellow. That is because those were the intake covers so nothing bad could happen to the intakes)

bug-reports 2020-06-05 12:33:45 There's a really annoying bug where, if you stop in your creation on the ground, it locks your creation in place and you have to flip to fix it.
Easiest way to fix it without flipping right now is putting a motor that doesn't attach to a block, which updates it, but I think it would be better to have a fix, rather than sticking a random motor to our creations.
(cant get screenshots right now, will try and get them later)
bug-reports 2020-06-05 12:47:42 Aight thats fine
bug-reports 2020-06-05 12:48:19 maybe if you could put something on the Roblox dev thread and alert Roblox to it
bug-reports 2020-06-05 12:48:31 Ah ok
bug-reports 2020-06-05 12:49:05 It's usually creations with free-turning wheels (ball wheels, landing gear, etc) that freeze
bug-reports 2020-06-05 12:49:16 So I think its because they dont want it to store momentum

creations-chat 2020-06-09 17:14:43 should I upload this or nah?
creations-chat 2020-06-09 17:14:53 its a cool pickup but idk
creations-chat 2020-06-09 17:23:04 doe you guys like my costom pickup/
creations-chat 2020-06-09 17:23:32 yeah needs more helium or ballast tanks
creations-chat 2020-06-09 17:23:45 because you can use ballast tanks to raise its position on the water
creations-chat 2020-06-09 17:24:18 also put helium in the highest point of the ship so it stays upright
creations-chat 2020-06-09 17:24:26 and is basically unflippable
creations-chat 2020-06-09 17:24:42 <@!280393446114590722> make a mini Iowa
creations-chat 2020-06-09 17:25:22 holy shit people actually like my pickup-
creations-chat 2020-06-09 17:25:25 how?????
creations-chat 2020-06-09 17:25:47 Everything I've ever made has bombed
creations-chat 2020-06-09 17:25:50 and now-
creations-chat 2020-06-09 17:25:58 *spluttering noises*
creations-chat 2020-06-09 17:26:05 yeah
creations-chat 2020-06-09 17:26:40 the headlamps I stole off another guy
creations-chat 2020-06-09 17:26:45 its actually a neat idea
creations-chat 2020-06-09 17:27:33 i dont like to upvote on creations that people dislike because i feel like they'll take it out on me
creations-chat 2020-06-09 17:27:40 yeah
creations-chat 2020-06-09 17:27:48 effort-wise i'd give it 100%
creations-chat 2020-06-09 17:28:06 if you took out the "Iowa" part from the name it would get tonnes of upvotes
creations-chat 2020-06-09 17:28:14 cuz its a good ship
creations-chat 2020-06-09 17:29:47 pancake dude was the only dude who downvoted because he thought it was low-effort
creations-chat 2020-06-09 17:30:26 check <#384021699466756107>
creations-chat 2020-06-09 17:32:09 yeah
creations-chat 2020-06-09 17:32:17 My main goal was to make it look nice
creations-chat 2020-06-09 17:46:38 Yo Jack gimme what you got
creations-chat 2020-06-09 17:46:47 I need constructive criticism
creations-chat 2020-06-09 17:47:09 no
creations-chat 2020-06-09 17:47:14 he upvoted mine
creations-chat 2020-06-09 17:48:47 You downvoted my creation so I was asking for constructive criticism
creations-chat 2020-06-09 17:49:16 Its only 2, don't get all hot and bothered mate
creations-chat 2020-06-09 17:49:54 Yeah thats fine
creations-chat 2020-06-09 17:50:04 I wanted to go for a simplistic and clean look
creations-chat 2020-06-09 17:50:14 If I put in too much detail it distracts people
creations-chat 2020-06-09 17:51:57 *And "Best Name of The Year" goes to.....*
creations-chat 2020-06-09 17:52:20 No seriously, that cracked me up.
creations-chat 2020-06-09 17:54:10 tbh I think the whole reason my pickup succeeded was because of the caption
creations-chat 2020-06-09 17:54:33 its... flat.
creations-chat 2020-06-09 17:54:59 I would suggest throwing in some lighter greys and making the cabin taller
creations-chat 2020-06-09 17:55:29 Stick lighter grays on the turrets and stuff, gives it more definition
creations-chat 2020-06-10 10:16:46 why do people like my cars?
creations-chat 2020-06-10 10:17:03 
creations-chat 2020-06-10 10:17:17

creations-chat 2020-06-10 10:17:38 GOOD IDEA
creations-chat 2020-06-10 10:18:07 No need

creations-chat 2020-06-10 10:22:54 Nice
creations-chat 2020-06-10 10:23:13 How does the artificial gravity work, I'm curious.
creations-chat 2020-06-10 10:23:37 Well, I understand the basic principle
creations-chat 2020-06-10 10:23:54 Disc go spinny and pull object
creations-chat 2020-06-10 10:24:33 But that requires real physics, which Plane crazy has none of.
creations-chat 2020-06-10 10:24:39 Except aerodynamics
creations-chat 2020-06-10 10:25:02 So I dont see how that would work
creations-chat 2020-06-10 10:27:05 ok thank you this will live forever
creations-chat 2020-06-10 10:27:28 wait so
creations-chat 2020-06-10 10:27:36 you built the interior first then the sub?

the-dump 2020-06-10 13:42:42 There was a time where they were trynna find out if the Pyramids were made by aliens because they was symmetrical and shit and they spent about 3 hours talking about crazy shit until they went up to some tired archaeologist and he just said "maybe they used a wheel" and the whole show just bombed
the-dump 2020-06-10 13:43:00 ***They literally forgot about circles***
the-dump 2020-06-10 13:57:47 The only reason there was an extra 5 was because that Earth god woman got 5 extra days off of Khonsu to give birth to her children
the-dump 2020-06-10 13:58:04 Because annoying sun man Ra wouldnt let her give birth
the-dump 2020-06-10 13:58:10 on any of the 360
the-dump 2020-06-10 13:58:20 so she betted with Khonsu and he added an extra 5 days

**~~ POWER ~~SPEED!!! UNLIMITED ~~ POWER ~~ SPEED!!!!!!!**
creations-chat 2021-03-05 14:22:37 yes congratulations. all jokes aside, i like the concept of your vehicle, just maybe if you tried adding a bit more detail to it it would be better, for example if you tried smoothing out the curves and getting rid of the flat surface **here**, it might be a bit better
