help 2021-05-10 01:53:29 But seriously how is it?
help 2021-05-10 01:54:47 I need to use the blocky method, otherwise I won't get the shape I need.
help 2021-05-10 01:55:24 I need the width to increase slowly
help 2021-05-10 01:55:30 You can't do that with wedges
help 2021-05-10 01:57:07 To get the shape I want with smooth wedges, the devs need to add more blocks.
help 2021-05-10 01:57:21 Right now, I can't do much to smooth it out.
help 2021-05-10 01:57:58 
help 2021-05-10 01:58:00 That's the shape I need
help 2021-05-10 01:59:21 I've already got the shape I want
help 2021-05-10 04:40:24 I am using custom angles. I was just explaining to someone why I couldn't use regular wedges
