bot-central 2020-08-12 04:34:24 ?shelp
bot-central 2020-08-12 04:44:52 &suggest  you should first off redo some blocks like the first of if your going to keep the rocket the way it is it would look weird because it cartoonish and weird looking I would change it into something like the Alamo missles or a side winder and also add a Gatling gun that takes up a 1x2 space and rotates like a real a-10 gun or f-14 gun, second is to redo the map the map is kinda bland and like making it bigger and add islands and stuff would be cool and third going with the whole map thing add a launch pads for rockets, we have water for well boats and a airport for planes and rails for well trains but another popular type of build is rockets, and we don’t have a launch pad, also a extra note make instead of just rocket engines add a whole new category names *advanced rocket engines* and redo some rocket engines to look like the Merlin engines or have like engines that leave a big ploom like srbs, And make all the rocket engines in the game have a bigger flame because they are so small compared to real life, that’s my opinion on what you guys should add and no you don’t have to add everything like just the launch pad idea would be good enough but I think it would be good to add some of these suggestions to your considered category

the-dump 2021-05-07 00:17:06 The missile knows where it is at all times. It knows this because it knows where it isn't, by subtracting where it is, from where it isn't, or where it isn't, from where it is, whichever is greater, it obtains a difference, or deviation. The guidance sub-system uses deviations to generate corrective commands to drive the missile from a position where it is, to a position where it isn't, and arriving at a position where it wasn't, it now is. Consequently, the position where it is, is now the position that it wasn't, and it follows that the position where it was, is now the position that it isn't. In the event of the position that it is in is not the position that it wasn't, the system has required a variation. The variation being the difference between where the missile is, and where it wasn't. If variation is considered to be a significant factor, it too, may be corrected by the GEA. However, the missile must also know where it was. The missile guidance computance scenario works as follows: Because a variation has modified some of the information the missile has obtained, it is not sure just where it is, however it is sure where it isn't, within reason, and it knows where it was. It now subracts where it should be, from where it wasn't, or vice versa. By differentiating this from the algebraic sum og where it shouldn't be, and where it was. It is able to obtain a deviation, and a variation, which is called "air"

creations-chat 2021-11-12 18:37:07 yea, currently im just working on getting the plane done atm, im suprised the prop rotates lol
creations-chat 2021-11-12 18:50:37 no, unfortunately. the angle is there to make the blades look angled when engines off
creations-chat 2021-11-12 18:52:52 there going to stay at a constant angle so maybe a little power will come from it but the motors are there for more looks than use

creations-chat 2022-11-23 22:50:06 blueprints suck because roblox pov and angle isnt exactly 90 degrees. when you look down iits at about 88 degrees.
creations-chat 2022-11-23 22:52:40 so your blueprint is basically invalid and you should make ur v-22 more proportional
