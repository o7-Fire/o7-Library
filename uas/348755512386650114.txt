help 2021-04-19 17:57:01 I'm currently trying to use motor propellers, I am using 4 (2 on each wing) and they move the plane, but some some reason when I start up the propellers they force the plane to turn to the left, I placed each propeller blades the same on each motor https://gyazo.com/5d5ab2eb143531771e9cf72b5543a777
help 2021-04-19 17:57:33 Is there a way to fix this?
help 2021-04-19 18:00:16 Would the rotor be facing forwards or to the side?

help 2021-04-19 18:01:34 It's a shame really, I had hoped by adding the propellers it would make my plane faster but instead it's reduced speed by 80 knots
help 2021-04-19 18:03:34 I think I understand
