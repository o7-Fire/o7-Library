creations-chat 2021-12-21 16:26:43 the cockpit looks like a su 57s, not a f-22s. i recommend using 1x2 wedge and 1x2 half up wedge cockpit style or angled  cockpit
creations-chat 2021-12-21 16:29:09 plus whole intake is wrong, omg cheese grater wings, pls fix spine, fix engine
creations-chat 2021-12-23 14:01:56 my advice is to the change the front wings a little
creations-chat 2021-12-23 14:05:04 imo f-18 front wings are over used, im just saying, ok then keep it

creations-chat 2022-02-04 12:52:05 the magic of motor locking
creations-chat 2022-02-14 15:50:59 what is that
creations-chat 2022-02-15 20:49:23 <:trollface:775024642104229898> heheheha
creations-chat 2022-02-15 20:55:18 **the easy way** ðŸ—¿
creations-chat 2022-02-15 21:04:54 good planes require to have good amounts of effort to be treated with such. easy way is just another way of saying that you dont want to put as much effort to make it look good. for me, i try my best and go to the hardest way, any hard way to make it the best as i can. just saying.
creations-chat 2022-02-15 21:07:09 ðŸ¤£ well atleast you tried the wings
creations-chat 2022-02-15 21:11:04 i never mentioned you betrayed me, but all of this because you said you wanted the easy way, not the hardest. the hardest way may not be perfect, and no ways are. but i just wanted to say that if you want something with good standards, then it should take good efforts.
creations-chat 2022-03-20 17:58:46 looks quite, hm. similar to something i have seen before made by somebody else.
