creations-chat 2021-04-04 15:02:07 any advice on how to recreate this ammo rack in plane crazy
creations-chat 2021-04-04 15:05:07 like with Os or emojies
creations-chat 2021-04-04 15:07:24 doesnt wanna go on the sign for some reason
creations-chat 2021-04-04 15:15:00 does this look ok? signs are just getting annoying
creations-chat 2021-04-04 15:18:00 ?
creations-chat 2021-04-05 04:24:06 any advice for my t55e1?
creations-chat 2021-04-05 04:26:28 like what kind?
creations-chat 2021-04-05 12:18:07 <@!763847040190775326>  you should try and get better colors imo
creations-chat 2021-04-05 13:02:24 <@!723940197456281640> you should try and make the turret fly off with the ammo detonation lol
creations-chat 2021-04-05 13:05:25 id suggest putting rockets (normal for the yellow exhaust) on the top of the turret facing down and add a dissconnector to the turret motor, probably got it all wrong but just trying to help lol
creations-chat 2021-04-05 13:09:49 oh alr
creations-chat 2021-04-05 13:33:00 do horns look decent as ammo/shells?
creations-chat 2021-04-05 13:37:41 or does this look better as ammo? ill find a way to hide the motorlock
creations-chat 2021-04-05 13:49:44 sure? what do you wanna build


uhhh
creations-chat 2021-04-05 13:52:07 kinda boring idea but, what about a sherman?
<@!611251614178869269>  what about a helicopter actually?
creations-chat 2021-04-05 13:54:32 k so you wanna go in a vip or smt?
creations-chat 2021-04-05 14:13:52 wouldnt 4 wings mean more motors/more lag/more parts
bot-central 2021-04-05 16:03:55 -pccmc
creations-chat 2021-04-05 16:21:30 does this ammo look good?
creations-chat 2021-04-05 16:24:05 how do i make it better?

whats a 1/4th circular block then?
creations-chat 2021-04-05 16:30:43 what about this? i can maybe add like a trail in the middle to make it look like its 2 seperate shells

sparkler is a full block <@!630182372444209182>
creations-chat 2021-04-05 16:33:30 kinda like this
creations-chat 2021-04-05 16:38:07 really hope i can get designer III with my T55E1, just need 5 more upvotes
creations-chat 2021-04-05 16:40:25 imo it looks a bit blocky from the front, also the back house part looks a bit weird, try making it flat and adding the helm above it, aswell as putting the stairway to below hull kind of connected to the new flat part and the deck
creations-chat 2021-04-05 16:42:52 kind of like this but a bit further back
creations-chat 2021-04-05 16:54:52 does this ammo rack look better? /:
creations-chat 2021-04-05 16:56:55 not the shells, just the ammo rack box with the Os on it since i cant find any circles that actually work on signs
creations-chat 2021-04-05 17:00:04 does anyone have a circle in text that actually works on the sign?
creations-chat 2021-04-05 17:04:56 do half cylinders look better?
bot-central 2021-04-05 17:27:02 ?shelp
creations-chat 2021-04-05 18:18:21 btw it was about the ammo rack box, not the shells
creations-chat 2021-04-05 19:01:47 not really tbh, its just super fast and if you encounter it headon chances are you'll kill it since you can MG the gunner and driver instantly and the T55E1s gun takes a while to stabilize after braking
