bug-reports 2020-08-06 20:48:38 I do not have proof, but DM me for more info. I made a small plane and helicopter for a carrier i’d made. The helicopter flew in circles because the huge carrier was next to it. The helicopter was perfectly semetrical. I do not know how to film on my pc, so here is my best description.
bug-reports 2020-08-06 22:20:13 Make sure that you confirm the safe and that the block number in the slot was updated.
