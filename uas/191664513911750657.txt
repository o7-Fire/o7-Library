help 2018-11-07 02:34:17 im having trouble making my jet roll
help 2018-11-07 02:35:40 it's not possible to perform a roll with the jet, I currently have 1 control surface on each side of the wing for the roll and 1 on the tail for each side

the-dump 2019-05-07 07:12:28 According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way that a bee should be able to fly. Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground. ... Because bees don't care what humans think is impossible." It's a nice idea, but in reality bees do not disobey any laws of physics
the-dump 2019-05-07 07:13:11 Have you ever heard about the benefits of raisin water? It’s amazing and an excellent addition to your diet, especially for promoting good liver health. 
So what’s the big secret behind raisin water? It stimulates particular biochemical processes in the liver that help it detox your bloodstream more effectively. The benefits of raisin water mostly come from the grapes themselves, which you might already know about. If you follow this treatment for four days straight, you’ll notice your digestion improves and you have much more energy. Would you really miss out on this opportunity? 
Doctors often recommend that you eat raisins in the morning to take better care of your heart, eliminate bad cholesterol, lower your triglyceride levels, and prevent constipation or an upset stomach. 
Raisins are a natural source of vitamins and minerals, but those benefits are increased tremendously if you consume the water that they are soaked in.
