creations-chat 2021-09-07 04:11:42 I mean my tanks are a lot better now
but my first tank is just a block with slanted frontal plastic, with no signs of any type of ‘armor’, not to mention it used rockets and plane wheels to move
creations-chat 2021-09-07 04:13:44 <@!742647076198023189> also how the fuck do you make working tracks
I need a tutorial holy s-
creations-chat 2021-09-07 04:18:27 meanwhile me using a t90 tutorial with no tracks and can barely handle me placing 1 gun on it, not to mention it has horrible durability with 1 gun being able to pierce it’s central turret rotation system and immobilize the entire thing



also gaming, I failed to make an entire tank that I worked so hard on with the tracks because I made it too thin
creations-chat 2021-09-07 04:20:31 or yer way too good, or watched a tutorial to get a hang of it before building it
