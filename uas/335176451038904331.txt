creations-chat 2019-08-29 01:24:17 Sorry I'm used to Reddit
creations-chat 2019-08-29 01:24:37 Also I called it a boat because i didn't expect everyone to know what an ekranoplan is
creations-chat 2019-08-29 01:24:47 and fine, i'll remove my upvote
creations-chat 2019-08-29 01:25:18 Neither does reddit karma
creations-chat 2019-08-29 01:26:03 it's not reposting if you make it yourself
creations-chat 2019-08-29 01:26:26 Just a question though... does it look like an ekranoplan?
creations-chat 2019-08-29 01:26:53 close enough

help 2019-08-29 04:38:00 Also, does the "Just like Elon" challenge allow wings and/or parachutes?
help 2019-08-29 04:39:38 It does say propulsion landing
help 2019-08-29 04:40:04 So I'm surprised about the wings
help 2019-08-29 05:15:11 So no shuttles?
help 2019-08-29 05:29:13 But could I use a vtol?
help 2019-08-29 15:40:54 A got a question about the "Just like Elon" challenge. Can the final stage of the rocket be a Vtol?
help 2019-08-29 16:53:39 PvP rockets?
help 2019-08-29 16:53:47 Wait nvm
help 2019-08-29 16:53:55 Those don't work in water
help 2019-08-29 16:54:15 You could add a super rocket to explosive blocks
help 2019-08-29 16:54:28 And launch that as a torpedo
help 2019-08-29 17:26:35 So does my vtol idea count?
help 2019-08-29 17:49:29 ok
creations-chat 2019-08-29 19:59:04 Since everyone said it didn't have enough wedges, I've smoothed out my carrier, and it's now up to 2750 Blocks. I'm applying for ShipWright IV
help 2019-08-29 20:46:04 So another question about the "Just like Elon" challenge... are jet engines allowed? I know it's a rocket, but for some parts with the landing craft they would work better. So are they allowed?
help 2019-08-29 20:47:26 Well turns out this question was pointless, as it turns out i didn't need them...

Another airport, and island, another railway station, a mountainous area and a volcano, etc.

creations-chat 2020-05-26 01:25:17 <@!527653676022628353>  I thought the same thing when making a Jaegar
creations-chat 2020-05-26 01:25:50 Sounds fun, till you try walking without falling. Sure you can cheat with thrusters, but that's not fun
creations-chat 2020-05-26 01:25:57 No clue
creations-chat 2020-05-26 01:26:02 Against torque
creations-chat 2020-05-26 01:26:15 I guess motor to keep it from rotating?
creations-chat 2020-05-26 01:26:22 like how your hips turn when walking
creations-chat 2020-05-26 01:27:25 I made a SUPER tiny mech actually, like 12 blocks
creations-chat 2020-05-26 01:27:32 Ses bke?

creations-chat 2020-05-26 01:27:44 With 2 motors
creations-chat 2020-05-26 01:27:56 1 motor for ankle, one motor for hip
creations-chat 2020-05-26 01:28:06 well the ankle is mixed with the knee
creations-chat 2020-05-26 01:28:20 the leg is just a half beam
creations-chat 2020-05-26 01:28:27 attached to feet and tiny body
creations-chat 2020-05-26 01:28:35 and mirrored on other side
creations-chat 2020-05-26 01:29:19 Well yeah, but I don't feel like making it weirdly small
creations-chat 2020-05-26 01:29:26 There's a SUPER tiny one by a friend of mine
creations-chat 2020-05-26 01:29:30 it's 5 or 6 blocks
creations-chat 2020-05-26 01:29:52 Whole thing
creations-chat 2020-05-26 01:29:57 That's what's so impressive
creations-chat 2020-05-26 01:30:57 I've only copied from a tutorial 3 times. Never for a full creation though, they were just for tiny vehicles to put on my carrier.
creations-chat 2020-05-26 01:31:08 A heli, a submarine, and a cessna(which I modified)
creations-chat 2020-05-26 01:31:23 Honestly the cessna is so different it might not count anymore
creations-chat 2020-05-26 01:31:32 But yeah I shamelessly followed those sub and heli tutorials
creations-chat 2020-05-26 01:32:08 The sub is 6x4x3
creations-chat 2020-05-26 01:32:14 Yes I know, why?
creations-chat 2020-05-26 01:32:26 I've also made one myself
creations-chat 2020-05-26 01:32:47 No?
creations-chat 2020-05-26 01:33:01 I built a mech that happens to be 6 blocks tall
creations-chat 2020-05-26 01:33:13 But could be 4 if I didn't use beams
creations-chat 2020-05-26 01:33:32 Also... I lied. I was not aware of that tutorial
creations-chat 2020-05-26 01:33:40 BRUH that's just a player

creations-chat 2020-05-26 01:34:14 I *am* a mech
creations-chat 2020-05-26 01:34:19 Oh, 1 high
creations-chat 2020-05-26 01:34:25 Thought you meant block count
creations-chat 2020-05-26 01:34:35 That's what I've been talking about this whole time
creations-chat 2020-05-26 01:34:47 Except for mine being 6 tall
creations-chat 2020-05-26 01:35:02 But the friend I mentioned with like a 5 block one? That's 1 tall if you count a seat as 1
creations-chat 2020-05-26 01:35:47 Sometimes, other times not though
creations-chat 2020-05-26 01:36:02 ...
creations-chat 2020-05-26 02:45:58 Dang, I was so close to designer III, but it seems a French monarch was not amused

creations-chat 2020-05-26 18:43:51 Or make the glass black or red
creations-chat 2020-05-26 18:44:09 Yeah red glass would be best
help 2020-05-26 18:44:18 Paint them red
creations-chat 2020-05-26 18:44:42 Hey, anyone wanna give some feedback on my jet? Downvoted, and I'd like to know why

creations-chat 2020-05-26 18:47:08 Alright fine, revoked
creations-chat 2020-05-26 18:47:23 I was curious if anyone would check if it didn't say on the first 3
creations-chat 2020-05-26 18:47:32 Nice one starcraft
creations-chat 2020-05-26 18:48:10 Nice
help 2020-05-26 18:49:35 Yes
creations-chat 2020-05-26 18:50:05 Nice
creations-chat 2020-05-26 18:51:12 I just make the canopy pop on mine, nothing complicated
creations-chat 2020-05-26 18:56:13 <@!697786877444358186> How'd you make your rocket so round looking on the top part? That's not cylinders, right?
creations-chat 2020-05-26 18:56:32 wow
creations-chat 2020-05-26 18:59:09 The lack of a 4x4 cylinder is really hurting my rocket
creations-chat 2020-05-26 19:00:56 motor 2
creations-chat 2020-05-26 19:01:43 ohhh that's how you fix that, thanks
creations-chat 2020-05-26 19:30:44 even just 4x4 like the half and wedge beams would be nice
creations-chat 2020-05-26 19:51:53 a block and a wedge
creations-chat 2020-05-26 19:52:03 so 1.5 blocks
creations-chat 2020-05-26 19:52:42 Uhg, building this quinjet is hurting my brain
creations-chat 2020-05-26 19:52:59 This area is annoying
creations-chat 2020-05-26 20:18:40 Uhg, don't you hate it when you're making good progress, then realize something was built in the completely wrong place?
creations-chat 2020-05-26 20:22:50 I like the shipyard
creations-chat 2020-05-26 20:23:03 reminds me of something from this lego space book I have
creations-chat 2020-05-26 20:24:12 this
creations-chat 2020-05-26 20:36:14 cool
creations-chat 2020-05-26 20:43:10 Dude that's adorable
creations-chat 2020-05-26 20:57:35 <@!679741669159207010> If you're gonna post something that's WIP, post it in *this* channel
creations-chat 2020-05-26 20:58:32 Well it needs the envelope
creations-chat 2020-05-26 20:58:51 And the railing should be different color from the rest
creations-chat 2020-05-26 20:58:57 Envelope, the balloon
creations-chat 2020-05-26 20:59:21 Yes, and maybe some gold accents on the hull
creations-chat 2020-05-26 20:59:27 Or metal accents
creations-chat 2020-05-26 20:59:34 Yes, that looks better
creations-chat 2020-05-26 20:59:58 Maybe switch to wooden planks instead of wood for the hull?
creations-chat 2020-05-26 21:01:35 Yes, better
creations-chat 2020-05-26 21:03:31 Ok, but have the deck be a bit darker than the rest of the hull
creations-chat 2020-05-26 21:12:32 How's my WIP quinjet look so far?
creations-chat 2020-05-26 21:13:09 <@!432354194960416769> Looks good. Curiosity rover?
creations-chat 2020-05-26 21:13:27 You should make Opportunity, it was the best one
creations-chat 2020-05-26 21:13:33 No, they are not all the same
creations-chat 2020-05-26 21:14:00 one sec
creations-chat 2020-05-26 21:14:04 there's a lot, lemme grab 2 pics
creations-chat 2020-05-26 21:15:08 On the right is Opportunity
creations-chat 2020-05-26 21:15:13 Left is Curiosity
creations-chat 2020-05-26 21:15:28 Biggest differene is size, and solar panels, and overall structure
creations-chat 2020-05-26 21:16:07 So did Spirit
creations-chat 2020-05-26 21:16:09 Nope
creations-chat 2020-05-26 21:16:42 Spirit and Opportunity were deployed at the same time, so basically the same. Curiosity is FAR more recent
creations-chat 2020-05-26 21:17:21 Well your current wheel looks perfect for it
help 2020-05-26 21:17:33 same
help 2020-05-26 21:17:41 or a stretch tool, as a lot of people have said
creations-chat 2020-05-26 21:18:16 No, the left
creations-chat 2020-05-26 21:18:24 since that fits your wheel better
help 2020-05-26 21:18:38 Just look in <#507673335816126509>
creations-chat 2020-05-26 21:18:45 Left is Curiosity
creations-chat 2020-05-26 21:19:02 yep
creations-chat 2020-05-26 21:28:52 <@!432354194960416769> yep
creations-chat 2020-05-26 21:44:21 An aircraft carrier airship
creations-chat 2020-05-26 21:51:01 lol
creations-chat 2020-05-27 01:19:43 <@!409676438682206218> We need to get that list of yours pinned
creations-chat 2020-05-27 16:48:50 <@!564503356576628737> The windmill shouldn't be green
creations-chat 2020-05-27 19:28:40 You yourself described it as "shit"
creations-chat 2020-05-27 21:05:04 I'm surprised, that of all the Jaegars I've seen people recreate, I've never seen a Brawler Yukon
creations-chat 2020-05-27 21:05:19 It's one of the simpler ones too
creations-chat 2020-05-27 21:05:27 Should I build it later?
help 2020-05-27 21:51:11 How the heck do you make a vehicle that can go on the rails and actual handle the turns?
help 2020-05-27 21:56:12 I tried that, but it just goes over the turns rather than turning
creations-chat 2020-05-27 23:28:45 Did you see over in <#384025409945337856> ? He turned himself into a pickle, funniest shit I've ever seen!
creations-chat 2020-05-27 23:32:14 Why are the giant propellor engines so TINY?
creations-chat 2020-05-27 23:32:16 and tall
creations-chat 2020-05-27 23:59:39 <@!443562221050658816> Can it?
creations-chat 2020-05-28 15:42:25 <@!273536574770380800> That tank might be the best one I've seen
creations-chat 2020-05-28 15:42:56 I have though
creations-chat 2020-05-28 15:43:05 That cromwell was top-notch
creations-chat 2020-05-28 16:18:17 <@!277197945273581570> we all do
creations-chat 2020-05-28 16:18:32 This is why a wedge stretch tool would be so handy
creations-chat 2020-05-28 16:19:25 Just saying, it would be way simpler to be able to make your own wedges, rather than adding like 30 more
creations-chat 2020-05-28 16:23:17 And the vote arrows aren't showing up on it
creations-chat 2020-05-28 16:24:14 weird
creations-chat 2020-05-28 18:53:14 Well the paint job needs some work
creations-chat 2020-05-28 18:53:20 for one thing, don't make it the same color as the ground
creations-chat 2020-05-28 21:49:05 So it can't fly?
creations-chat 2020-05-28 22:02:43 How does this quinjet look so far?
creations-chat 2020-05-28 23:10:58 I bet no one can guess what this incomplete vehicle is
creations-chat 2020-05-28 23:12:47 nope
creations-chat 2020-05-28 23:12:54 but close
creations-chat 2020-05-28 23:13:31 close, but no
creations-chat 2020-05-28 23:14:28 uh... I guess
creations-chat 2020-05-28 23:14:37 It's a Hydroplane
creations-chat 2020-05-28 23:14:40 and it's incomplete
creations-chat 2020-05-28 23:15:14 Boeing
creations-chat 2020-05-28 23:15:24 
creations-chat 2020-05-28 23:15:28 As far as I know Boeing only had the one
creations-chat 2020-05-28 23:15:48 Oh I should tint the glass
creations-chat 2020-05-28 23:15:59 that's a hydroplane
creations-chat 2020-05-28 23:16:22 no
creations-chat 2020-05-28 23:16:40 just google "hydroplane unlimited"
creations-chat 2020-05-28 23:16:54 well yes
creations-chat 2020-05-28 23:17:13 Also they were named for the engines they used, which were formerly aircraft engines
creations-chat 2020-05-28 23:17:35 Read what I just wrote
creations-chat 2020-05-28 23:17:36 that's why
creations-chat 2020-05-28 23:17:58 And if you're just gonna call it a boat, then when someone posts a 747 you could just say it's a plane
creations-chat 2020-05-28 23:40:05 What's it from?
creations-chat 2020-05-29 00:33:02 My wifi is terrible
creations-chat 2020-05-29 00:33:10 sometimes it just cuts out randomly
creations-chat 2020-05-29 00:34:35 Apparently a bandwidth of 3 is recommended for most games, and mine is 2.4 lol
creations-chat 2020-05-29 00:37:24 go into properties when choosing a wifi
creations-chat 2020-05-29 00:37:39 And look for Network Band
