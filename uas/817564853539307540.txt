creations-chat 2023-03-07 03:08:25 No, it's not. I got that earlier, I guess it just looks like one.   Look man, I made that myself, so you're probably confused. I don't do tutorials.
creations-chat 2023-03-07 03:10:49 Why would I lie about using a tutorial on the PC discord server.
creations-chat 2023-03-07 03:15:33 Yeah, Dodge discontinues their best selling car and makes a piece of crap EV.
creations-chat 2023-03-07 03:18:25 I hate myself. Send me a screenshot of the "tutorial" you think I'm using. Please.
creations-chat 2023-03-07 03:26:47 Okay. Goodnight, have a goodnight. I am mid, so I will be having a midnight.
creations-chat 2023-03-07 20:38:28 Yes, but I don't lie. I give people credit for their creations,, I don't steal. I don't know what tutorial you think I'm using, I don't know. Please tell me. I do not steal, and I don't use tutorials.

creations-chat 2023-03-08 02:23:15 Finished the the "top half," of the B17, made it too long, so I'll push the canopy up two or so blocks, and make the top half shorter.
creations-chat 2023-03-08 02:35:58 I'm glad he's gone, he was being annoying for two days, but it was funny to watch.
help 2023-03-09 02:42:53 Tint or no tint?
help 2023-03-09 02:53:21 Explain what you are trying to do.
help 2023-03-09 02:55:50 Hmm..
help 2023-03-10 03:14:58 <@1025827600716796014> Because the wheel is touching the block. Move the wheel out one more block, then it will work.
creations-chat 2023-03-11 00:52:59 Trying to make this ball turret is giving me a brain aneurysm.
creations-chat 2023-03-11 02:58:12 Speaking of that, look at my crappy B-17 so far!
