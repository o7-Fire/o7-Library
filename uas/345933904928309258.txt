The Tale of tormented_spider1 (345933904928309258)
creations-chat 2019-03-17 11:09:42 Mah first robot build. all joints move except for the hands.. (cause there are no hands xD)

Over 1500+ parts

Has two swords, a fully rotatable head and arms, has a very simple walking mechanism (Instead of walking, it more so slides it's feet around while jets help it move a LITTLE bit forwards). Oh, and it can also pick itself up when toppled over, since it's swords act like an extended arm.
creations-chat 2019-03-17 11:27:04 From that angle they do. xD
creations-chat 2019-03-17 11:27:21 actually maybe they just normally look wierd.
creations-chat 2019-03-17 11:27:26 Might remake them eventually.
creations-chat 2019-03-17 11:49:35 looks smooth.

creations-chat 2019-03-17 11:51:27 /looks like it may be hard to steer though, with all of that speed?
