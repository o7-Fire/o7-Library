creations-chat 2020-06-02 18:44:28 And that may be so, but at least I am a fairly well mannered one.
creations-chat 2020-06-02 18:44:53 As the saying goes, "Said the teapot to the kettle."
creations-chat 2020-06-02 18:45:18 No speak english?
creations-chat 2020-06-02 18:45:29 The more common phrase is "Takes one to know one."
creations-chat 2020-06-02 18:45:54 You speak it.
creations-chat 2020-06-02 18:45:56 So....
creations-chat 2020-06-02 18:46:18 .
creations-chat 2020-06-02 18:46:35 You should at least understand the phrase it takes one to know one.
creations-chat 2020-06-02 18:46:44 That is a fairly common phrase.
creations-chat 2020-06-02 18:47:13 Yes they do. That's why it is called a common phrase.
creations-chat 2020-06-02 18:47:22 Because people use it.
creations-chat 2020-06-02 18:47:44 Again, you are not from an english speaking area.
creations-chat 2020-06-02 18:47:51 So of course it is not common there.
creations-chat 2020-06-02 18:48:04 Then you should know what it means.
creations-chat 2020-06-02 18:48:13 You should.
creations-chat 2020-06-02 18:48:33 Even someone who doesn't use it should easily know what it means.
creations-chat 2020-06-02 18:48:45 If you don't, you might require therapy.
creations-chat 2020-06-02 18:52:25 > this went from some dumbass saying i need a therapist because i called somebody's roblox plane ugly to common english sayings and how you're better than all of us because you know them
I didn't say i was better because I know them, I implied I was better because I have better manners and know when to be partly polite instead of a blundering fool.
creations-chat 2020-06-02 18:53:07 Again, back to that common phrase, Takes one to know one.

creations-chat 2020-06-02 18:54:56 K, I will check it out.
creations-chat 2020-06-02 18:55:09 Cygnus, smartness is relative.
creations-chat 2020-06-02 18:55:31 the width?
creations-chat 2020-06-02 18:55:34 you mean the diameter
creations-chat 2020-06-02 18:55:53 do you mean the diameter
creations-chat 2020-06-02 18:56:08 you need to tell me what the DIAMETER IS
creations-chat 2020-06-02 18:56:09 dummy
creations-chat 2020-06-02 18:56:12 not the width
creations-chat 2020-06-02 18:56:15 DIAMETER
creations-chat 2020-06-02 18:56:34 Width is different than diameter
creations-chat 2020-06-02 18:56:37 its completely different
creations-chat 2020-06-02 18:56:45 to find the answer you need to correct parts.
creations-chat 2020-06-02 18:56:53 lets just say the diameter is 5
creations-chat 2020-06-02 18:57:04 if the diameter is 5
creations-chat 2020-06-02 18:57:09 then the radius is 2.5
creations-chat 2020-06-02 18:57:12 which means
creations-chat 2020-06-02 18:57:15 98.17 is the volume
creations-chat 2020-06-02 18:59:34 Cygnus, no need to worry, by now your brain cells have gone through an apocalypse
creations-chat 2020-06-02 19:01:44 Dead is still fine, and fine is relative.
creations-chat 2020-06-02 19:02:44 I just find it amusing how it seems decent to make fun of someone in a game, most likely because someone does that to them....
