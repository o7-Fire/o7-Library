plane-crazy 2020-06-22 04:18:23 yes especially if you surround your body in it
plane-crazy 2020-06-22 04:17:37 Thanks
plane-crazy 2020-06-22 04:16:49 Strange question. But, what icon is the water sprayer under?
plane-crazy 2019-09-21 00:18:25 heck yeah dude
plane-crazy 2019-09-21 00:17:49 let me reword this *what I heard is that blacklisting someone out of protection in pvp is bannable*
plane-crazy 2019-09-21 00:16:12 Idk
plane-crazy 2019-09-21 00:15:26 Okay I may have missed a rule, but is blocking someone in pvp right next to you bannable?
