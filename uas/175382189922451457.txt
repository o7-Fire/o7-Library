creations-chat 2020-06-07 02:09:17 I'm currently making a Alaska Airlines 737-400 Combi, I'm considering making the fuselage longer to accommodate the logo on the side.

creations-chat 2020-06-08 23:52:43 https://gyazo.com/fc1fee55e8cb5f1e2514fcbca100ba8b Are you still confused?
creations-chat 2020-06-08 23:53:39 What are you confused about?
creations-chat 2020-06-08 23:53:53 I can't help you there, sorry
creations-chat 2020-06-08 23:54:59 I made contra rotating propellers in Plane Crazy for a XB 35 that I might make
creations-chat 2020-06-08 23:58:44 Are you still confused?

creations-chat 2020-06-10 00:25:56 It looks like it's held in place by a swing set
creations-chat 2020-06-10 00:26:23 more precisely a swing chair
creations-chat 2020-06-12 15:32:26 That's really epic
creations-chat 2020-06-12 15:43:40 Interesting
creations-chat 2020-06-12 15:43:59 Stealth Fighter
creations-chat 2020-06-12 15:45:04 motor3, I've heard that you can use em to go invisible
creations-chat 2020-06-12 15:45:56 Yeah I just used cameras
creations-chat 2020-06-12 15:46:09 for those who didn't get the joke
creations-chat 2020-06-18 16:20:58 maybe try some ballast?
creations-chat 2020-06-18 16:21:30 ah okay
creations-chat 2020-06-19 20:56:56 Man, that reminds me, I really dislike when people copy that tutorial and then use it in PVP, I mean come on that plane is almost as big as the area you spawn in and you haven't considered that a larger target is easier to shoot down?
creations-chat 2020-06-19 21:06:57 sup
creations-chat 2020-06-25 19:48:27 That destroyer looks like a big project
creations-chat 2020-06-25 19:53:20 https://gyazo.com/16a59fd11552f3ebef871de0f5fb1b1c Afterburner Mechanism (Now I realize why so many people use Locked Motors in their builds)
creations-chat 2020-06-25 20:52:57 It took me like 10 minutes to make xD
creations-chat 2020-06-25 20:54:40 It was just a concept that I put on a block stand
creations-chat 2020-06-25 20:57:40 None taken

creations-chat 2020-07-01 05:40:09 Hmm, I just had a thought. Is the Plane Crazy tutorial in different languages besides English?
creations-chat 2020-07-01 05:41:57 Not exactly, but sure let's go with that.
creations-chat 2020-07-01 05:44:46 Wouldn't Roblox automatically change text files in published games for people who chose to set the option to Spanish etc?
creations-chat 2020-07-01 05:48:12 Anyway guys, let's keep this chat relevant to creations.
creations-chat 2020-07-01 05:49:03 Yeah, lol xD
creations-chat 2020-07-01 21:51:40 Maybe use a 1x3 wing wedge for the front and a 1x4 wing for the back, that's what I would do personally
creations-chat 2020-07-06 19:39:01 <@!431283338716905472>  You use copy paste emoji's
creations-chat 2020-07-25 04:35:18 My P51D aircraft, I used motor2 to make custom rudder, alerions, horizonal stabilizer, fuel drop tanks.  Please feel free to tag me if you have any building tips and suggestions for me to improve the design, thanks
creations-chat 2020-07-25 04:38:46 Sorry, I added motor2 to all the control surfaces making it custom
creations-chat 2020-07-25 04:39:23 Yeah using a little bit of blueprints
creations-chat 2020-07-25 04:40:04 Maybe a little more engine?
creations-chat 2020-07-25 04:40:55 
creations-chat 2020-07-25 04:41:40 Yeah it's a little short
creations-chat 2020-07-25 04:41:48 xD
creations-chat 2020-07-25 04:42:38 Ok, thanks for the feedback
creations-chat 2020-09-27 18:19:22 Here's the image of the aircraft I based my creation on in case any of y'all were curious. https://discordapp.com/channels/384021699466756103/384025409945337856/759840367687893052
creations-chat 2021-01-04 07:27:28 Currently remaking my Boeing 727 to version 3, going to be quite challenging and fun!
creations-chat 2021-03-19 02:50:26 Currently trying to make a better 737 nose with motorlock. I'm open to any ideas on how to improve the shape/curvature of the front of the aircraft. Thanks!
creations-chat 2021-06-22 01:17:20 Poor dad
creations-chat 2021-06-25 05:57:27 That cockpit glass is so smooth!

creations-chat 2021-06-26 17:26:17 This is why I don't post in Creations...
creations-chat 2021-06-26 22:43:50 Kill it with fire
creations-chat 2021-07-02 01:25:57 https://gyazo.com/19636cf35deff232058cc5a005ba31d9 What do y'all think about my 727 reverse thrust?
creations-chat 2021-07-02 01:30:08 Lol
creations-chat 2021-07-02 01:34:19 <@!354786846049566720>  Some pretty serious FOD right there.
creations-chat 2021-07-03 03:28:19 https://gyazo.com/8e890016be9776c615836815ea1ac8a6 Both thrust reversers done on my 727
creations-chat 2021-07-07 01:43:34 Nope, get out of here scammer
creations-chat 2021-07-07 01:47:18 "Free Nitro, oh wait your account is stolen, wopsies I wonder how that could have happened."
creations-chat 2021-07-20 01:03:55 737 300 that I started to build a couple of years ago, finally figured out how to motor lock the cockpit windows. (Eventually going to put it in <#384025409945337856> whenever I feel like it.)
creations-chat 2021-07-22 14:14:36 ^
creations-chat 2021-07-26 21:21:52 <@456226577798135808>  Look up blueprints, Sketchfab is a really great  online 3D program to use to model any type of vehicle you are building.
creations-chat 2021-07-26 21:24:44 No problem
creations-chat 2021-07-28 00:11:19 <@670636377792184330>  would you like some feedback/improvements you could make on your 707?
creations-chat 2021-07-28 00:15:07 I would make the wings thicker, add some inverted top 1x2 half slabs to the bottom of the main wings.
creations-chat 2021-07-28 00:30:10 <@!670636377792184330>  I would also move the fan blades 1 block back, make the rudder 1 block thick (I would put some wing panels vertically with disconectors added on both sides to ensure your plane is vertically stable.)
creations-chat 2021-07-28 02:38:14 At least this dude's f22 hasn't blown up with views.

creations-chat 2021-08-05 01:26:27 Looking amazing!
creations-chat 2021-08-08 22:09:21 Cessna 172 or 152 because 152 only has 2 seats
creations-chat 2021-08-28 18:00:31 <@!633408435601276945>  That A320 cockpit looks really good
creations-chat 2021-08-28 18:03:11 Meanwhile I'm working on a 727, so much pain and suffering.
creations-chat 2021-08-28 20:12:39 ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ I guess if you have any ideas for how to improve the shape then I'm all ears.
creations-chat 2021-09-18 17:25:56 He's just trying to get us creations blacklisted, lol

creations-chat 2021-09-21 23:00:28 Wild guess, it's a F104...
creations-chat 2021-09-28 21:19:37 
creations-chat 2021-10-05 03:18:07 Kinda reminds me of the cargo bay on the Valkyrie shuttle from the movie "Avatar"
creations-chat 2021-10-08 20:19:19 Work in progress 737 cockpit with modern instruments.
creations-chat 2021-10-08 20:23:37 Thanks, although the yokes work I'm just thinking of it being a stand alone cockpit and not actually a full flight simulator.

creations-chat 2021-10-26 00:52:45 Use Tamiya tape, also did you use a paint can and was it super humid outside?
creations-chat 2021-10-26 01:04:56 Oof, were you sure it the paint was good for plastic models? What brand was it? I heard somewhere that certain spray paints actually eat away at the plastic.

creations-chat 2022-01-24 19:15:12 WIP 737 8 Max cockpit, pretty happy with this, although I'm not entirely sure if I'll be able to finish the whole nose as it already takes up a large portion of the plot.
creations-chat 2022-01-28 06:26:49 bigger is better
creations-chat 2022-03-09 00:52:06 *Takes notes*
the-dump 2022-04-19 01:52:56 I wanna know what that tax fraud script does in the Creator Marketplace
