creations-chat 2021-06-05 23:45:50 yeah... didn't really know how to implement it well so i just went without it
creations-chat 2021-06-20 15:55:36 lol
creations-chat 2021-06-20 15:59:02 hmmm
creations-chat 2021-06-20 16:01:14 if you were making it bigger you could use half block down 1x2s and then pyramid wedges to make it look the most realistic

but obviously thats on a larger scale build
creations-chat 2021-06-20 16:11:31 that looks good except for the thousands of guns on the turrets and then obviously you're planning to paint it different from just plain white right?


try putting the guns in the turrets via motorlocking or just putting less guns in
creations-chat 2021-06-20 16:13:59 what kidn of boat are you basing this off of? a destroyer?

<@!812089451450466364> edit your message instead of waiting for another minute
creations-chat 2021-06-20 16:19:20 Need feedback on my destroyer, I'm not sure what else to add. I have lifeboats and guided missiles as well as torpedoes and turrets. (and interior) (also my skin is minecraft steve)
creations-chat 2021-06-20 16:22:00 ok so ill smooth the front and try to fix up that front gun and also add some more detail on the side
creations-chat 2021-06-21 12:38:52 ðŸ‘Œ
creations-chat 2021-06-21 12:43:09 well to answer your question yes, and make is less obvious bc right now it kinda sticks out

also they're saying ur image is low quality basically (but it's 144 p definitely)
creations-chat 2021-06-21 12:56:08 yeah maybe on a tank

help 2021-06-25 13:48:27 Use half wedge and then motors to get a more realistic propellers and then I would use round wedges or just half wedge downs to get a better body for the propeller thing
