creations-chat 2020-06-10 10:25:51 well, when you add zero g to anything, theres alot more you can do, it opens a door, instead of just aerodynamics you now have a simulated space enviroment without radiation and that nasty stuff

creations-chat 2020-06-10 10:28:51 yes.
creations-chat 2020-06-10 10:28:53 it did
creations-chat 2020-06-10 10:32:39 well since roblox has janky physics, instead of walking along the wall, the spinning force pulls me to the floor with earth gravity in zero g, so it half works in normal walking mode, but in ragdoll mode it works with earth gravity and lets me stick to wall like it should in real life

creations-chat 2020-12-15 13:16:14 <@!691268263459684472> scale the rocket booster up so its more realistic, dont use helium instead use wing panels inside around fuel beams for stability when tilting and propeller engines inside at the top for rcs control if you dont have snow blaster thing and make less blocky (example. use curves and wedges etc.) and try to have the solar panels and satellite inside a fairing like a real rocket, the stage seperation is clean and functionality is great but over all the looks could use alot of improvement. :)
creations-chat 2020-12-15 13:22:35 if you want help with making a rocket with no helium dm me, i can make simple rocket stages that function well and are more "realistic" and can help you out with the curves and wedge part if you struggle with that too, if you want help i can make a simple rocket booster and you can take ideas from it and add new features to it if you want :)
creations-chat 2020-12-15 13:24:55 did they really just post a ksp shuttle on minimum graphic settings?
creations-chat 2020-12-15 13:26:56 yeah in creations someone posted a ksp shuttle on minimum graphics it looked look a chunk of polygons and the kerbal planet behind it looked like the ps2 graphics whoever it was has no graphics card in their pc :/
creations-chat 2020-12-15 14:58:39 im making something inspired by this ;)
creations-chat 2020-12-15 15:16:17 probably the tutorial plane?
creations-chat 2020-12-16 00:55:14 still wip any ideas on what too add maybe?
creations-chat 2020-12-16 12:21:01 bruh <@!691268263459684472> asked for suggestions not insults jeez so toxic in here lol, try make it less thicc and blocky, add slopes and wedges and small external details like ladders etc add the headlights under the main lights and fix the placement of wheels and use a better green and change the hubcaps to grey like they are in picture :)
creations-chat 2020-12-16 12:27:19 bruh jesus christ <@!712273624865701921> why do you need to post a billion screenshots of the one single plane so much? what is the need you just clogging up creations jeez you only need like 3 screenshots not enough to the point theres more screenshots than stars in the night sky :/
creations-chat 2020-12-16 12:35:47 he asked for suggestions not bombardment of insults jeez he is clearly fairly new so give him some tips for improvement instead of insults :/
creations-chat 2020-12-16 12:37:48 <:IntendedFeature:706289545548660746> commit motor lock, helps alot for detail :) <:IntendedFeature:706289545548660746>
creations-chat 2020-12-16 12:44:20 <@!698131825662361663> train looks good, good job but the truck could maybe use less, exposed motor... and maybe more range of colour, the ac130 try make the wings better, theres a huge gap and the rear wings although undone, are not a good thing to start that way, there quite inaccurate as you see, also front wings need more curve as you see here in the image :)
