the-dump 2022-12-13 23:56:16 Native Americans, also known as American Indians, First Americans, Indigenous Americans, and other terms, are the Indigenous peoples of the mainland United States (Indigenous peoples of Hawaii, Alaska and territories of the United States are generally known by other terms). There are 574 federally recognized tribes living within the US, about half of which are associated with Indian reservations. As defined by the United States Census, "Native Americans" are Indigenous tribes that are originally from the contiguous United States, along with Alaska Natives. Indigenous peoples of the United States who are not listed as American Indian or Alaska Native include Native Hawaiians, Samoan Americans, and the Chamorro people. The US Census groups these peoples as "Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islanders".

European colonization of the Americas, which began in 1492, resulted in a precipitous decline in Native American population because of new diseases, wars, ethnic cleansing, and enslavement.[4][5][6][7] After its formation, the United States, as part of its policy of settler colonialism, continued to wage war and perpetrated massacres against many Native American peoples, removed them from their ancestral lands, and subjected them to one-sided treaties and to discriminatory government policies, later focused on forced assimilation, into the 20th century.[8][9][10] Since the 1960s, Native American self-determination movements have resulted in positive changes to the lives of many Native Americans, though there are still many contemporary issues faced by them. Today, there are over five million Native Americans in the United States, 78% of whom live outside reservations. The states with the highest percentage of Native Americans in the U.S. are Alaska, New Mexico, South Dakota, Montana, and North Dakota.[11]

When the United States was created, established Native American tribes were generally considered semi-independent nations, as they generally lived in communities.

the-dump 2022-12-14 00:01:30 Reply from Joshua Alexander
The area along the Colorado River gets very little rain.  The summers are hot and the winters are mild.  Quechan and Mohave settlements were located on high ground away from the river during the winter and early spring, when the river might flood.  The people moved closer to the river in the late spring and summer.  Some settlements had as many as several hundred people, but families were usually spread out over a mile or two, rather than clustered in villages.

Both Quechan and Mohave thought of themselves as tribes made up of many clans or bands.  The tribe came together to make war against neighboring tribes, and to celebrate the harvest.  The Mohave and Quechan were often allies against neighboring tribes.  Each settlement had one or more headmen who were chosen by the people.  The headmen from all the settlements sometimes met together to discuss things of importance to the entire tribe.

HOUSES

Houses in this desert country were usually just shade roofs (called ramadas), with four or six poles supporting a flat roof covered with bundles of reeds or grasses.  For cold weather, the houses had side walls made from poles slanting from the ground to the roof, covered with bundles of grass and then with a layer of mud several inches thick.  Sometimes a settlement would have one or two such houses larger than the rest, where the leaders lived.  If the weather was very cold, they would invite others to stay with them.

It seems that neither the Mohave or the Quechan used sweathouses, as most early Californians did.

In the hot, dry southwestern desert, people did not need to wear many clothes.  Women made apron-like skirts from the inner bark of the willow tree, pounded until it was soft.  The knee-length skirts were made in two pieces, one for the front and one for the back.  Men either went without clothing, or wore a girdle,  woven from pieces of willow bark, around their hips.  Children usually wore no clothes.

For the few times when the weather was cold, both men and women wore robes or blankets over their shoulders.  They made the blankets from strips of rabbit skins sewn together.  Sometimes they carried a piece of burning wood, called a firebrand, to keep themselves warm.
the-dump 2022-12-14 00:02:09 Mohave and Quechan men and women wore their hair long, treating it with a mixture of reddish mud and the sap from willow bark.  Men rolled their hair into long strands, sometimes as many as 20 or 30 of them, that hung down their backs.  Both men and women painted designs on their faces, often keeping the same design for many months. The paint was a protection from the hot desert sun, as well as being a decoration.   They used plants to make red, yellow, green, black and white dyes.  Men wore bead or shell ornaments in their ears and noses.
the-dump 2022-12-14 00:02:17 TOOLS

The Mohave and Quechan were not known for their skill in making tools.  Since they did very little hunting, their bows were simple and their arrows often had no sharp points.  In fact, they made very little use of stone or bone for tools or implements.  From wood they made planting sticks and hoes used in weeding the gardens. 

Although they lived along the river, the Mohave and the Quechan did not build boats.  Once in a while they would tie several logs together to make a raft, but they usually swam when they wanted to cross the river.  To get their supplies or their children across the river, they put them in a very large pottery bowl and pushed it ahead of them as they swam across.

Fishing was done from the river banks with nets, traps, or long-handled scoops.  Nets and traps were made from cord, which was made by twisting plant fibers together.  The scoops were woven from reeds and plant fibers, like baskets.

The Mohave and the Quechan made both baskets and pottery containers, which they used for carrying and storing food.  Pottery bowls, made from clay found along the river, were sometimes decorated with designs in red and black.  Their baskets were coarsely woven from arrowweed branches, often with the leaves left on them.  Women carried loads on their backs in net bags attached to rough wooden frames, supported by a band across the forehead.
the-dump 2022-12-14 00:02:26 TRADE

The Mohave and the Quechan did not show much interest in gathering wealth for themselves.  They shared food supplies with each other, and did not value other possessions.  They were all rather equally well-to-do or equally poor.

Trading was done between the Mohave and Quechan, and with groups living both east and west of them.  The Quechan grew wheat and traded it to the Mohave, who did not grow wheat.  From the Hopi, to the east, they both got blankets.  They also had contacts with other California groups.

CEREMONIES

Each year, people from all the settlements would gather with their tribal neighbors to celebrate the fall harvest.  Each family brought food for the feasting.  Communities also joined together once a year for a mourning ceremony to remember those who had died during the past year.

the-dump 2023-01-08 22:30:44 heres the recipie if you cant find it 

6 tomatoes, quartered
1 onion, quartered
1 capsium/ bell pepper, chopped
1 whole garlic bulb
Chilli flakes (optional)
1/2-1 cup unsalted vegetable stock
1/2-1 cup cream
3-4 basil leaves
Salt and pepper

2 slices of your favourite bread
Mozzarella cheese
Cheddar cheese
Butter

Method:
1. Chop off the top of your garlic bulb, leaving the cloves exposed. With your garlic, place all your other chopped vegetables into a large baking dish, drizzle generously with olive oil, chilli flakes, salt and pepper and bake at 200C for 50-60 mins until the vegetables are slightly charred and soft. 
2. [optional] Use a blow torch and lightly torch your roasted vegetable to add extra char if you like your soup smokey. Careful not to burn it. 
3. Transfer your vegetables into a pot or a blender with your stock, cream and basil. With a stick blender or a normal blender, blend your soup until smooth. Salt and pepper to taste. 
4. For your grilled cheese, cut up 2 slices of bread. You can use any cheese you want or have on hand. I used mozzarella for the stretch and cheddar for the bitey taste. Butter your bread and grate as much cheese as your heart can take. Grill in a pan over medium heat until golden brown and cheese melted. Serve with tomato soup.

creations-chat 2023-05-23 22:05:35 Grass is a type of plant with narrow leaves growing from the base. A common kind of grass is used to cover the ground in places such as lawns and parks. Grass is usually the color/colour ‘green’. Grasses are monocotyledon herbaceous plants.
The grasses include the "grass" of the family Poaceae. This family is also called Gramineae. The family also include some of the sedges (Cyperaceae) and the rushes (Juncaceae).[1] These three families are not closely related but all of them belong to clades in the order Poales. They are similar adaptations to a common life-style.

The true grasses include cereals, bamboo and the grasses of lawns (turf) and grassland. Uses for graminoids include food (as grain, sprouted grain, shoots or rhizomes), drink (beer, whisky), pasture for livestock, thatching thatch, paper, fuel, clothing, insulation, construction, sports turf, basket weaving and many others.

Many grasses are short, but some grasses can grow very tall, such as Bamboo. Plants from the grass family can grow in many places and make grasslands, including areas which are very arid or cold. There are several other plants that look similar to grass and are referred to as such, but are not members of the grass family. These plants include rushes, reeds, papyrus and water chestnut. Seagrass is a monocot in the order Alismatales.

Grasses are an important food for many animals, such as deer, buffalo, cattle, mice, grasshoppers, caterpillars and many other grazers. Unlike other plants, grasses grow from the bottom, so when animals eat grass they usually do not destroy the part that grows.[2] This is a part of why the plants are successful. Without grass, soil may wash away into rivers (erosion).

It's interesting that you're using uni joints instead of a dynamo to overcome the speed difference between the left and right wheels during a turn, and that you're using an open differential with 1:1 bevel gears attached to it. It sounds like you've put a lot of thought and effort into this project, and I'm looking forward to hearing more about your progress! 🤓

creations-chat 2023-06-28 02:03:12 Title: The Elusive Dream: Plane Crazy 2 and the Discord Server Inferno

Introduction:
In the vast realm of Roblox game development, enthusiasts often harbor lofty aspirations for sequels and new creations. One such dream revolves around the beloved game, Plane Crazy. However, there is a prevailing belief that the developer, Rickje, will never bring Plane Crazy 2 to fruition. This essay aims to explore the reasons behind this skepticism and the purported burning of his Discord server, shedding light on the unique dynamics of the Roblox community.

Body:
I. The Elusive Sequel:
    a. Ambitious Expectations: Plane Crazy captured the hearts and imaginations of players with its innovative flight mechanics and creative possibilities. Naturally, fans yearn for a sequel that builds upon its success.
    b. Developer's Reluctance: Despite the clamor for Plane Crazy 2, Rickje has remained tight-lipped, leaving players to speculate on the reasons behind his hesitation. Some posit that the immense pressure to surpass the original game has hindered progress.
    c. Creative Direction: Developing a sequel requires careful consideration of the game's identity and vision. Rickje's reluctance may stem from a desire to ensure that Plane Crazy 2 lives up to the expectations of the community.

II. Discord Server Inferno:
    a. Community Outbursts: The Roblox community is known for its passionate and sometimes volatile nature. Discontentment over the absence of Plane Crazy 2 has led to heated discussions within Rickje's Discord server.
    b. Discord Server Burn: While the notion of a literal server inferno may be an exaggeration, metaphorically, tensions and conflicts within the server have threatened to consume the sense of unity and shared enthusiasm.

Conclusion:
In the realm of Roblox game development, the prospect of Plane Crazy 2 remains shrouded in uncertainty. Rickje's apparent reluctance and the simmering discontent within his Discord server add to the intrigue surrounding.

creations-chat 2023-07-06 19:10:35 Flightpoint and Plane Crazy: A Comparative Look

Flightpoint, a game on Roblox, has drawn attention due to similarities between it and Plane Crazy. Developed by chisled_cheese, Flightpoint has been described by some as a copy of Plane Crazy.

While there may be similarities, it is important to consider the nuances and individuality of each game. It is also worth noting that the age of chisled_cheese, the developer of Flightpoint, has not been confirmed. Making assumptions about someone's age without concrete evidence is not fair or accurate.

Both Flightpoint and Plane Crazy provide players with aviation experiences, allowing them to pilot different aircraft in a virtual environment. However, it is crucial to recognize that games often inspire each other, and creators draw inspiration from existing ideas to build upon them.

Rather than focusing solely on the perceived similarities, it is essential to appreciate the effort and creativity put into crafting each game. Both Flightpoint and Plane Crazy provide unique gameplay experiences, attracting different audiences and offering distinct features.

In the world of game development, it is important to foster creativity and encourage young developers, regardless of their age. It is through their contributions that the gaming community thrives, pushing boundaries and exploring new possibilities.

In conclusion, while Flightpoint and Plane Crazy may share similarities, it is important to recognize the individuality of each game and refrain from making assumptions about the developer's age. Let's celebrate the creativity and diversity of the Roblox gaming community, appreciating the unique experiences that each game brings to the table.

contest-chat 2023-07-13 21:50:58 would the yak-38 be a three engined aircraft
contest-chat 2023-07-13 21:55:49 "The Yak-38 is a three-engined aircraft. It has two Rybinsk RD-38 turbojets and one Tumansky R-28 V-300 turbofan."
creations-chat 2023-07-13 21:59:27 is the yak-38 a three engined aircraft?

"The Yak-38 is a three-engined aircraft. It has two Rybinsk RD-38 turbojets and one Tumansky R-28 V-300 turbofan."
creations-chat 2023-07-13 22:12:39 then literally no plane has 3 engines according to that logic

it has 2 intakes leading to one main engine with 2 thrust that can rotate at the back, thats 1 engine

then you have 2 engines that can stabalize its vtol capability
creations-chat 2023-07-13 22:14:44 then why is it a contest
creations-chat 2023-07-13 22:17:27 i get it did you even read the messages

he said flaps and elevators and everything that moves on a plane is an engine

how can you read one message and think you know everything

contest-chat 2023-07-14 22:04:44 the two intakes connect to one main engine that leads to two thrust thingies, so thats powered by one engine (it can rotate)

then it has two engines at the front to stabalise vtol
