bot-central 2021-04-02 00:55:58 Almost at rank 3 nice
creations-chat 2021-04-02 00:57:20 Wow
creations-chat 2021-04-02 00:59:21 Thats amazing <@593544426111107085> I can't wait to show my train creations specially the one with the Pantagraphs
creations-chat 2021-04-02 01:02:10 This is one of my newest trains I call it the LME Local Liner and it had two Pantagraphs
creations-chat 2021-04-02 01:06:43 It has 2 working Pantagraphs and has a some sighs with English and Japanese language on them and I made the cabins have over head cargo platforms and a nice smooth design
creations-chat 2021-04-02 01:08:41 Also I love your EMD F7A local motive design I really like that you added the nice shaped out widows to it <@702234928666116127>
creations-chat 2021-04-02 03:27:03 Unfortunately no one likes my train creations or the guys helicopter creation
creations-chat 2021-04-02 03:29:11 I spent pretty good effort into both of those trains that have Pantagraphs but it's unfortunate that no one admires that type of stuff anyone or nice helicopter design, but I think the guys helicopter looked pretty cool regardless of people's thoughts. And for my trains I'll just stick with there design I like them regardless
creations-chat 2021-04-02 03:33:18 Well I respect your opinions I just like classy and modern trains so I made my trains look in between both and called my little train line LME but in time I'll be making them in my own little train simulator and everything and maybe on more advanced games, but yeah.
creations-chat 2021-04-02 03:37:11 Well I kinda gave it that nice amtrak paint job a nice horizontal paint job and maybe in time I'll change the paint job but yeah
creations-chat 2021-04-02 03:39:12 Well I like it black and purple a nice black primary color and a line purple secondary color going across the train
creations-chat 2021-04-02 03:41:47 Either your talking about the LME RL Class 25's colors or the LME RL Class 12 colors because the LME RL Class 25's colors is still a work in progress
creations-chat 2021-04-02 03:43:49 And the LME RL Class 12's livery is the classic LME livery
creations-chat 2021-04-02 03:48:58 Hey man I'm just a train builder, I stopped building planes.
creations-chat 2021-04-02 03:53:04 Besides, I love building trains, I know everyone may not like my train designs or meet to there qualifications but I enjoy building my trains.
creations-chat 2021-04-02 03:55:09 Now I can tell your all nay more mature then me and way more into high quality stuff, but I know my stuff may be garbage but hey that's just my ways if building it may suck but in time it will look cool.
creations-chat 2021-04-02 03:57:11 And for your helicopter man, it looks amazing I really like your livery style towards it, yes the body may be odd but in a way I quit like how you made it and keep up the good work man.
creations-chat 2021-04-02 04:04:10 Well it's a wonderful helicopter in every way, unfortunately my trains won't be getting anywhere, but that's why I'll be doing my own things in the future I know now this server is for more high class builders I'll just stick with my own things
creations-chat 2021-04-02 04:06:19 I hope you all have a goodnight stay safe and healthy.
creations-chat 2021-04-02 04:10:55 I've seen the video on that train, but it's just odd it's huge and everything else I just make my trains for the right size so people can ride on them, but yeah.
creations-chat 2021-04-02 04:16:18 Well I honestly joined this group because I though people where gonna be supportive and like my creations, not be the extremely judged or not shown much of support, but I've learned my lesson, so I'll be going now, once again I hop you all have a good night and stay safe and healthy, bye now.
creations-chat 2021-04-02 04:20:20 I'll make sure next time when I enter a server I'll actually check everything to make sure I'm comfortable with it, see you all.
creations-chat 2021-04-02 04:22:26 Ok, goodbye.
creations-chat 2021-04-02 05:08:43 Oh I am now.
creations-chat 2021-04-03 03:17:27 Oh yeah I know, I just wanted to show what's happening to my train so now I'm just going to fully do everything and get wback with you all
creations-chat 2021-04-03 18:06:12 This is my LME BX C32 now the detail and livery is pretty nice, now I'm trying to see how I should make the roof and folding
creations-chat 2021-04-03 18:08:25 Any ideas on how I should make the roof if I'm going to add a Pantagraph?
