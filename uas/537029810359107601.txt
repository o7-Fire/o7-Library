help 2022-10-31 18:47:32 hey so i built a plane that has a propeller built with a motor and half wedges
help 2022-10-31 18:47:48 but when the propeller spins (motor is toggled) the whole plane slightly rotates
help 2022-10-31 18:48:08 which is not good and i want to fix that
help 2022-10-31 18:48:37 yeah
help 2022-10-31 18:48:45 it rolls, thats what i meant
help 2022-10-31 18:49:07 the motor?
help 2022-10-31 18:49:12 its at 20
help 2022-10-31 18:50:37 sooo how do i make it not roll when the motor is toggled
help 2022-10-31 19:10:16 actually it works fine with something that is more centered like trails
help 2022-10-31 19:10:27 but those are too small for propeller blades
help 2022-10-31 19:12:57 alright i just need an alternative to the half wedges that will look decent

creations-chat 2023-04-01 21:33:29 how many studs is a block actually
creations-chat 2023-04-01 21:36:34 a Roblox character is 5 studs tall, right? so that makes a stud equivalent to a foot
creations-chat 2023-04-01 21:38:38 wasn't the official roblox definition for a stud like 5cm or something I read about that online somewhere
creations-chat 2023-04-01 21:40:45 5-6 inches is a lot but okay
creations-chat 2023-04-01 21:44:24 actually around 12 inches but okay

creations-chat 2023-04-16 16:29:58 put more wing, put more engines if it gets slower
creations-chat 2023-04-16 16:33:19 actually framerate doesnt matter ü§ì

creations-chat 2023-04-16 16:45:16 yeah still fps doesnt change the fact that im bad at the game
creations-chat 2023-04-16 16:47:44 gaming laptop
creations-chat 2023-04-16 16:50:11 üòî
creations-chat 2023-04-16 17:02:29 my biggest creation is 402 blocks üëç
creations-chat 2023-04-16 17:04:49 its a bad f-14 i made a long time ago so no
creations-chat 2023-04-16 17:06:54 mostly mid size to small jets, i just dont use a lot of motorlock
creations-chat 2023-04-16 17:09:49 i usually do like a 4 block tall or 2 block tall motorlock tower, rarely some motors to get low wings/ high wings
creations-chat 2023-04-16 17:13:48 like this (ignore the low quality ms paint i just cant boot up the game rn)
creations-chat 2023-04-16 17:16:34 one tower per build
yeah its cramped up as hell but it works and thats what matters right
creations-chat 2023-04-16 17:20:23 you just have to be really careful on how you place things
creations-chat 2023-04-16 17:23:53 i usually dont really care how my builds look, as long as they work as intended, they usually end up looking okay
creations-chat 2023-04-16 17:27:06 i  just try to get the proportions as good as i can
creations-chat 2023-04-16 17:29:31 i mean they really arent the best looking
creations-chat 2023-04-16 17:37:31 how
creations-chat 2023-04-16 17:39:37 that doesnt really matter since its on the ground at all times right
creations-chat 2023-04-16 17:43:39 yeah sure
creations-chat 2023-04-16 17:52:32 they're pretty good ngl
creations-chat 2023-04-16 18:32:57 why do i come to a chat about block planes and see a conversation about transgenders
creations-chat 2023-04-16 18:36:41 you mean like XY chromosomes? thats just male isnt it though
dont hate on me i failed biology
creations-chat 2023-04-16 18:39:51 honestly i couldnt care less about gender as long as there is at least one hole
creations-chat 2023-04-16 18:45:15 damn my points still stands
creations-chat 2023-04-19 13:38:55 yo so basically i kinda wanna make a tank but im horrible at making tanks so i need some advice and all
creations-chat 2023-05-17 16:11:47 why are actual jet engines worse than propellers in this game ong
creations-chat 2023-05-17 16:18:49 a single propeller engine is a third faster than two jet engines
creations-chat 2023-05-17 18:36:41 make this abomination
creations-chat 2023-05-18 17:58:53 i tried making a simple glider looking plane and i accidentally made it go 1300 speed
creations-chat 2023-05-19 14:34:44 this game is actually bad
the only decent way to propel aircraft is literally a glitch
a jet engine is just slightly better than two small propellers
creations-chat 2023-05-19 14:37:29 literally three jet engines are worse than a single propeller
creations-chat 2023-05-19 15:29:41 it isnt, it never was
creations-chat 2023-05-19 15:32:12 im making it out of the mental hospital with this one
creations-chat 2023-05-19 15:37:55 i've deleted it and tried to make something myself
creations-chat 2023-05-19 16:22:42 it kinda isnt probably because im stupid and built it badly
best i can do is cover the top
creations-chat 2023-05-19 16:25:01 its beautiful wym
there still is some on the bottom but i coudlnt care less
the worst thing about it is that it actually flies
creations-chat 2023-05-19 16:28:50 how am i gonna fit this shit in a five block long 50 block biplane
creations-chat 2023-05-19 16:41:21 idc this beauty doesnt need to be modified
creations-chat 2023-05-19 16:46:15 i may have or may have not forgot rudder control
