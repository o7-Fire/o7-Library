plane-crazy 2020-07-15 04:57:39 ???
plane-crazy 2020-07-08 06:09:53 Almost as bad as that pun
plane-crazy 2020-07-08 06:09:30 Not sure how to feel about that.
plane-crazy 2020-06-21 22:03:34 I think I've discovered something weird. It's not a glitch tho.
plane-crazy 2020-05-14 04:55:42 It's just my sleep schedule (and my sense of time as a whole) has pretty much collapsed on itself.
plane-crazy 2020-05-06 08:47:48 There's 4 ways to fix this. (at least to my knowledge)
1: Add engines to the front.
2: Helium to the front side.
3: Ballast blocks to the back side.
4: Remove some engines in the back.
I'm not a VTOL pro though.
plane-crazy 2020-04-28 08:55:50 post that in reports and follow the format. (I think it's in the pinned message, but I haven't checked.)
plane-crazy 2020-04-27 07:46:46 It's cold there. I like the cold.
plane-crazy 2020-04-24 20:28:31 Probably not the largest built, but my largest is over 4500.
I bet someone here has a build over 6000 parts though.
plane-crazy 2020-04-24 20:00:37 TitanicAiden2013 I recommend putting that in <#504436696021204992>
plane-crazy 2020-04-24 19:57:41 It's called bait.
