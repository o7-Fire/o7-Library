plane-crazy 2020-04-10 01:33:33 Well, soap+methylated spirits does that.
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 01:31:04 Well, that’s what happens when you use methylated spirits
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 01:28:30 Nope, tried that
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 01:28:17 Hmm time to clean
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 01:28:07 Hahah
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 01:28:04 Lol
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 01:27:07 But I think soap will do
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 01:26:54 Maybe not strong alcohol
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 01:26:34 Or methilated spirits?
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 01:26:19 But soap?
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 01:26:14 Never heard of it
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 01:25:57 Clorox?
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 01:25:45 Hey, I’ve tried
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 01:15:10 Although, my screen is filthy, anyone have any other ideas then a micro fibre cloth?
