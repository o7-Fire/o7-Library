help 2021-12-01 22:48:15 Alright, first attempt at being creative. What I need help from the amazing people here is how should I start building the base for it that could accommodate an engine but still manage to be true to the second picture shown. ||(it was from a flash game I played years ago called porta potty racers)||


I got bored figuring it out and just shoved an engine at the back and hoped it would fly. 

||*it certainly flied without wings and has exceeded expectations.*||
