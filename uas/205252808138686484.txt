help 2021-02-24 20:56:48 idk how to help on that one, i was about to suggest gear reductions but then how would they speed up after that <:Thonk:509498568982134816>
help 2021-02-24 20:57:03 ^
help 2021-02-24 20:57:09 the most simple of solutions
help 2021-02-24 20:57:16 or just make a whole transmission system
help 2021-02-24 20:57:17 ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
help 2021-02-24 20:57:40 ya gotta go back to the past
help 2021-02-24 20:58:05 there's better gear systems im sure of it
help 2021-02-24 20:58:14 im trying to figure that out now
help 2021-02-24 20:58:28 <:nooo:787097964946259978>  fabric cylinders
help 2021-02-24 20:58:59 well-
help 2021-02-24 20:59:03 im using the chain as more of a timing belt
help 2021-02-24 20:59:23 and i want the belt to stay fully attached to the gears as possible
help 2021-02-24 20:59:27 for maximum torque
help 2021-02-24 20:59:44 more friction in this case is better
help 2021-02-24 20:59:46 for me atleast
help 2021-02-24 21:00:30 https://gyazo.com/c446e33c14b137050dc5c54a7ac1cff7

help 2021-02-24 21:01:13 
help 2021-02-24 21:02:09 they are fabric clynders
help 2021-02-24 21:02:10 at the core
help 2021-02-24 21:02:23 i just used the rigid blocks to keep the belt from slipping
help 2021-02-24 21:02:35 and incase it does slip the halfblocks are there for keeping it on
help 2021-02-24 21:02:45 
help 2021-02-24 21:03:00 its two 3x3's in the center
help 2021-02-24 21:06:06 but then it does this
help 2021-02-24 21:06:07 
help 2021-02-24 21:06:10 thats my issue
help 2021-02-24 21:06:22 so
help 2021-02-24 21:06:22 the top cylender has no fairing to keep it in because the motor is there
help 2021-02-24 21:06:25 <:Thonk:509498568982134816>
help 2021-02-24 21:06:27 im stuck

help 2021-02-24 21:08:23 thats also my issue lol
help 2021-02-24 21:08:41 having to work around the unrealistic nature of this game is iffy
help 2021-02-24 21:10:44 that was my issue
help 2021-02-24 21:10:51 when it tried making a v8
help 2021-02-24 21:11:02 which i just had to turn into a twin-shafted i4x2
help 2021-02-24 21:11:13 which is why im also making this gear drive lol
help 2021-02-24 21:14:03 yo thats genius
help 2021-02-24 21:16:14 welp thats the first time out of ~50 tests that the chain snapped
help 2021-02-24 21:16:15 
help 2021-02-24 21:16:23 these physics lol
help 2021-02-24 22:52:45 <@!683847069890510887> ?
help 2021-02-24 22:52:46 oh
help 2021-02-24 22:52:48 yeah that lol
help 2021-02-24 22:53:10 ive been working on this for a while, im thinking about turning it into a track-driven tank that can drive over almost anything
help 2021-02-24 22:53:33 the engine would have to be sideways ofcourse for the tracks since i cant make a differential
help 2021-02-24 22:53:39 atleast idk how to
creations-chat 2021-02-25 00:42:19 https://gyazo.com/e92de80071d2cf0aeeb87ae29b9a70df any ideas on how to improve this?

creations-chat 2021-02-25 07:59:02 The slim, sharp, compact design mixed with the variety of the police/coast guard aesthetic and the little helipad is nice, also the color scheme is real nice to me, i am particularly a fan of the black and gold mixture, and just to say again, god damn that is a slick curvy boy, ya did good <:ElonApprove:589130525315301380>
creations-chat 2021-02-25 08:01:05 The red and blue lighting on the top mixed with the compact helipad

creations-chat 2021-02-25 11:25:48 well there was a secondary i4 that the chain drive would turn the crankshaft of but, it broked
creations-chat 2021-02-25 11:28:25 Eh, couldnt find an acceptable way that wasnt just making springs compress
creations-chat 2021-02-26 01:51:48 how many parts (the red in the camo is pain)
creations-chat 2021-02-26 01:54:19 how many parts is it though <:empty:794431705070174238>
creations-chat 2021-02-26 01:56:35 Vtol III engineer moment, if it moves, but that camo is painful, and the nose looks like it was flattened, other than that if it moves im impressed because i dont know planes for shit <:hahaa:773727260539617280>

creations-chat 2021-02-26 04:21:22 is there a better way to get this thing to extend outwards to tighten the track or do i just have to eat this fate
