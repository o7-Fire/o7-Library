bug-reports 2020-11-26 01:11:45 At the end of the video, I'm not sure why this happens but the folding part on my build likes to flick at an unwanted point at around 6000+ height.
bug-reports 2020-11-26 01:12:50 It could be with my motor2 settings...
bug-reports 2020-11-26 01:14:22 There is not anchors or helium on the aircraft the only technical part is the one motor2 I use to fold.

creations-chat 2020-12-15 16:53:03 Good but use different lengths of wedges as the cone gets bigger, so use 1x4 at the start then 1x3 and so on

creations-chat 2021-01-05 13:51:40 <@!670939038999511041> I'm surprised your creations don't get more upvotes
bug-reports 2021-01-05 14:24:12 The "Toggle" function on the water wheel doesn't work. Both settings will gradually mane the wheel spin slower and slower.
creations-chat 2021-01-15 19:19:31 <@!456219506486804480> I smell an SLS
creations-chat 2021-01-19 16:25:05 <@456226577798135808> You might want to try different colors on the ERA. it makes it look better than a solid green texture

creations-chat 2021-01-24 05:03:21 <@!649796186399834113> that is going to be a very sexy plane
creations-chat 2021-01-24 05:08:58 It looks really nice but, how much plot do you have left
creations-chat 2021-01-24 23:19:29 So I have this Blackhawk all done structurally but, For some reason it likes to keep turning to one side without any control. Any fix?
creations-chat 2021-03-17 12:47:18 Does anyone know why or how to fix the constant spin on helicopters? Every heli I make continuously yaws to the right.
creations-chat 2021-03-17 12:49:52 I have this great looking Osprey that doesnt lag and it has this issue.
creations-chat 2021-03-17 12:57:10 Dont try to calculate that. People have tried.
creations-chat 2021-03-17 13:06:58 About a third, I think, idk correct me if im wrong.
creations-chat 2021-03-17 13:11:54 So, The rotors are not powered and are only used as bearings and I have 4 super rockets controlling roll on each side.
creations-chat 2021-03-17 13:27:12 Make the engines more profound, they are too tucked away.
creations-chat 2021-03-17 23:49:01 Now I am.
creations-chat 2021-03-17 23:56:55 It looks too good, great job.
creations-chat 2021-03-18 14:24:32 They are meant to be small, the wings are like that to produce as little drag as possible, this thing goes over mach 1 irl.
creations-chat 2021-03-18 14:27:10 Thats not all to modern, it was made in 1958.
creations-chat 2021-03-18 14:29:12 O ok kool.
creations-chat 2021-03-18 15:46:38 <@!473580489337339914> Cuz we watchin The Final Coundown.
creations-chat 2021-03-23 22:33:25 Ok so, since all of you seem to not like my Osprey, whats wrong. i would really like to know so i could fix/redesign that.
creations-chat 2021-03-23 22:35:27 Well, ok.
creations-chat 2021-03-23 22:37:58 Ok, I'll take note of that.
creations-chat 2021-03-23 22:48:45 <@!640752250536460341>  At least you got the blades correct.
creations-chat 2021-03-23 22:53:59 It looks good but the coloring is off.
creations-chat 2021-03-24 14:26:19 <@!580713604320591873> That looks amazing, The Panther.

bug-reports 2021-06-16 08:04:59 PLEASE fix the bug in pvp where other peoples builds will detach from their original build. Example; When shot at the player's build will partially freeze in the air. The other bit will still show motion but there is little of it. Sometimes the builds will be invisible and it is awful. Sorry for pestering of this has come up more than once.
bug-reports 2021-06-16 08:06:44 Yeah but I just had that happen and there was like a couple rocket engines floating though the air..
creations-chat 2021-07-02 03:43:48 Is there ever gonna be a new map or no? I've heard and seen different renditions of a new one but no clarification.
