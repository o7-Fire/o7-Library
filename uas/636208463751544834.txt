creations-chat 2019-11-24 18:28:38 Small fighter plane, capable of going upwards of 611 SPS and remains stable, lots of pewpews, a ship and ground target killer
creations-chat 2019-11-24 18:28:57 Yeah that jet engine is actually quite important to balance out of the center of flight
creations-chat 2019-11-24 18:33:25 I will, it's just a prototype right now
creations-chat 2019-11-24 18:36:51 A **very** functional carrier that I made a few weeks ago, intended for PVP, has four guided missiles hidden away in silos, a really ugly mouse-controlled CIWS, functional catapult system, compartments on the inside like a meeting room and secondary bridge.
creations-chat 2019-11-24 18:39:55 That's not an issue that anyone can really fix
creations-chat 2019-11-24 18:40:03 The carrier is literally as big as it can get
creations-chat 2019-11-24 18:40:21 Why not?
creations-chat 2019-11-24 18:40:50 Yeah but it's not some recreational WW2 carrier that serves no purpose apart from being eye candy
creations-chat 2019-11-24 18:41:01 It wasn't really meant to be exceptionally good looking
creations-chat 2019-11-24 18:41:16 Uhuh
creations-chat 2019-11-24 18:42:07 Did I ever say I did?
creations-chat 2019-11-24 18:42:17 It's a god damn floating kill box
creations-chat 2019-11-24 18:43:27 I'm just wondering why people tend to show their opinion more on my ugly carrier than my plane
