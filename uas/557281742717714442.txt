Sensor
MECHANICAL

The sensor would detect if a vehicle is in front of it and how far it is away. The range of detecting things, what to detect , and what the sensor activates will be controlled with the screw driver. It should activate sensor blocks (sensor motors, sensor thrusters, etc) when it detects something. There should also be different types of sensors that detect speed, height, angle, etc and activate those sensor blocks based on it.
