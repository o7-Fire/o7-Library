creations-chat 2023-05-12 15:10:12 ok I understand, if the T-80 needs a few tweaks, I have planned to put a camouflage on it<:stuff:908917207986208828>

creations-chat 2023-05-12 21:03:33 ok then nothing right? It's not like someone arrives and specifically pinches me, puts big-mouthed faces and for a change, be your Claudio.

creations-chat 2023-05-24 08:22:38 I graduated as a Soviet designer, well, nice and cheap xd
creations-chat 2023-05-24 08:25:43 nothing to do xd, it's difficult to do a caterpillar type, I opted for the classic ones, since they are easy to do and the truth is that they don't look so bad.
creations-chat 2023-05-24 17:53:19 That B3 model has not implemented the torque detail, although I have another model that is the T-80, this one does have torque, and everything that has to do with the suspension is a headache, believe me I almost gave up doing the suspension of the T-62, and because of the type of scale, it is very, very difficult to track it
creations-chat 2023-05-24 17:55:24 If the piece that you tell me about here is called a torque roller, which is the one that is connected to the gearbox
creations-chat 2023-05-24 18:00:06 No, did the smoke grenade launchers face forward?
creations-chat 2023-05-24 18:04:50 (T-90) The smoke grenades face the front, and you could even angle them to make them more noticeable
creations-chat 2023-05-24 18:06:54 The T-80 launches the same Smoke grenades and the same angle  y en todos los modelos rusos el lanza granadas miran al frente<:thoink:657279634563399720>
