help 2021-12-19 08:42:51 or is that a bad thing
help 2021-12-19 08:48:00 it's wobbling back and forth
help 2021-12-19 08:48:15 when walking
help 2021-12-19 08:56:39 sometimes lag can cause wobbling i think
help 2021-12-19 08:57:41 <@456226577798135808> u good at mech?
help 2021-12-19 08:57:47 I need help
help 2021-12-19 08:58:41 my mech balancing is dogwater
help 2021-12-19 08:58:46 it can barely walk
help 2021-12-19 09:53:34 if I used regular powered motors for a mech's leg wouldnt they be in odd positions if it got bumped rly bad and be forced to respawn or something
help 2021-12-19 10:30:27 my mech can't walk properly
help 2021-12-19 10:30:59 that doesn't help
help 2021-12-19 10:31:17 there's very little resources on youtube that teaches u how to make ur mech stable
help 2021-12-19 10:32:33 so it's 1:1:1, front:middle:back or some parts need to have more helium
help 2021-12-19 10:36:16 yeah did that
help 2021-12-19 10:36:38 if more it might start floating
help 2021-12-19 10:37:08 I only have 2 max ballast at the feet 1 on each leg
help 2021-12-19 10:37:24 I think there needs to be improvement on my walking mechanism
help 2021-12-19 10:38:09 every motor below waist level (entire leg) are free and it is powered by some propellers
help 2021-12-19 10:38:20 I cant make a walking mech with powered motors
help 2021-12-19 10:39:04 the leg when launched
help 2021-12-19 10:40:23 for refference

help 2021-12-20 03:50:29 the mechanism isn't but I still can't figure out how it works

help 2021-12-20 13:10:17 <:FineTroll:626841259746656289>
bug-reports 2021-12-22 10:41:39 tnt works, but I believe the explosion is delayed so it probably exploded only after bouncing off target therefore missing, just a theory
help 2021-12-23 15:17:04 
creations-chat 2021-12-24 01:41:33 idk how
creations-chat 2022-01-10 06:25:32 <@753399511061233694> make the body open and close like a Titanfall mech
creations-chat 2022-01-10 08:47:05 segsy
creations-chat 2022-01-11 14:54:05 bet, how do i take a vid on windows, ok
creations-chat 2022-01-11 14:59:22 https://streamable.com/5ud182  (had to angle it so u guys can see it running from side view and the acalyte pods following my mouse that's why the acalyte pods going weird lol)
creations-chat 2022-01-11 15:05:33 im gonna build ronin titan next
creations-chat 2022-01-11 15:28:47 if his 35k block was a lie, warn, if he reveals he really has 35k block, prob less downvotes
creations-chat 2022-01-11 16:06:07 why hide 35k sticks within sticks
creations-chat 2022-01-11 16:15:42 tried making the arms move but not much space for that, would probably need to redesign the arms, that's the best I can do to simulate running, how else could I make it run stable without helium support, ok thx
creations-chat 2022-01-12 03:28:44 is that a rounded answer
creations-chat 2022-01-12 03:34:26 1 meter = 1.42857 block
1 block = 0.7 meter

no, the further it multiplies the more it get inaccurate so consider it 1.4
creations-chat 2022-01-12 03:37:10 I don't use feet but according to google it's 2.29659
creations-chat 2022-01-12 16:54:38 wing panels made movement a lot smoother and consistent now (thx), will make a new video of it running again soon
creations-chat 2022-01-14 06:30:03 step 3: leave the server
creations-chat 2022-01-14 06:56:09 I copied Titanfall 2
creations-chat 2022-01-14 08:46:40 I have a question, what do you use to propell your tank forward
creations-chat 2022-01-14 09:10:11 so ur saying his tracks are scarpping the ground and his wheels are useless, ok ima do a tank like that
creations-chat 2022-01-14 09:13:11 2 block wide? im trash at motor lock
creations-chat 2022-01-14 09:17:45 I think i will just go back to making Glamrock Freddy
creations-chat 2022-01-14 09:22:25 Have you heard of Among us, Gregory?
creations-chat 2022-01-14 12:05:52 me too <:pogey:651848693842182144>
creations-chat 2022-01-17 14:10:18 you prioritize detail over functions?
creations-chat 2022-01-17 14:12:57 pvp or not, I value function just as much as the design, because I really don't enjoy having a good looking build that has limited functions, it's just my opinion that I like functions just as much as design (make a video on the functions ðŸ˜³)
creations-chat 2022-01-17 14:15:07 I actually thought ur nozzle could move up and down <:empty:794431705070174238>, turns out I overestimated something
creations-chat 2022-01-17 14:18:21 I guess keeping the aesthetic while having a functioning nozzle becomes more difficult or not depending on the tank frame and design in the first place
creations-chat 2022-01-23 03:19:29 <@!753399511061233694> you can use this emoji for the headlight instead of circle, âšª

events-chat 2022-01-28 09:38:03 can i only join the bonus round with whatever mech i have
creations-chat 2022-02-03 21:22:59 how does blast pressure affect tnt block, specify what it actually does, does it delay the explosion?
help 2022-02-03 21:25:38 does blast pressure delay tnt block explosion
help 2022-02-03 21:25:50 also does it affect the explosion radius
help 2022-02-03 21:32:25 where is it
help 2022-02-03 21:33:45 wait
help 2022-02-03 21:33:49 what does impact speed do exactly
creations-chat 2022-02-03 21:34:23 emotional damage
help 2022-02-03 21:36:22 ohh
help 2022-02-03 21:36:28 so if I make impact speed of 0
help 2022-02-03 21:36:31 then it blow instantly
help 2022-02-03 21:37:00 if I put the missile on impact, and impact speed of 0
help 2022-02-03 21:37:12 would the 'on impact' settings be finally useful ðŸ—¿
creations-chat 2022-02-16 12:42:39 <@638063314752241735> u dont put F1 downforce wings for drifting
creations-chat 2022-02-18 11:57:16 teleporter is definitely not allowed within the rules, what is 0g, how, if the vehicle have no weight I can slip
creations-chat 2022-02-18 12:21:31 cool, if u read what I said, I only need performance, additional performance feedback, big or small, I will take it, if aesthetic feedback, I know what u are going to say already, some sacrifices have to be made for performance
creations-chat 2022-02-18 12:24:22 winter wheels are the grippest things that exist in plane crazy, I tested it, winter wheels are still way better in cornering
creations-chat 2022-02-18 12:26:48 then u can fuck off, I'm only here for performance feedback to dominate the F1 entry not some whining joe ðŸ—¿, I will dm u a video of the performance when I'm free later
creations-chat 2022-02-18 12:29:05 active suspension system, soft anti roll bar, triple hybrid engine mix, extra adjustable wings both front and back before cornering, u can give me some more if u can think of one, I'm really trying to think of a good tech to add in
creations-chat 2022-02-18 12:38:22 wdym elaborate
creations-chat 2022-02-18 12:41:05 they aren't glitchy, they are just very very grippy, so grip u can flip from turning, if u have F1 downforce, u won't flip

doesn't matter, it don't mess with performance
creations-chat 2022-02-18 12:44:37 im in an F1 entry that have certain rules, looking good isn't one of them

donâ€™t care + didnâ€™t ask + cry about it + stay mad + get real + L + cope harder + h0es mad + basic + skill issue + ratio + counter ratio + you fell off + the audacity + triggered + stay mad+ any askers + redpilled + get a life + ok and? + cringe + touch grass + donowalled + not based + yourâ€™re probably white + GG! + get good + go outside + not based + grammar issue + your're* + ad hominem + reported + you're a full time discordian + not funny didn't laugh + hahahahaha cry
creations-chat 2022-02-18 12:46:41 my F1 is not aesthetic based, im here for performance feedback not toxic aesthetic comments
creations-chat 2022-02-18 12:49:58 so pcc is the wrong place to ask for F1 performance feedback <:empty:794431705070174238>

I posted specifically here for feedback on performance for the entry
creations-chat 2022-02-18 12:52:39 basically wasted time here explaining the existing performance tech components on my F1 but got nothing in return
creations-chat 2022-02-18 13:27:08 should I report
creations-chat 2022-02-18 13:29:11 ok I'll let him go ðŸ—¿
creations-chat 2022-02-18 13:42:04 can I ask u for performance feedback in dms, here is useless other than people vomitting on me
creations-chat 2022-02-18 13:49:45 
creations-chat 2022-02-18 13:52:15 <@!335599526414909451> <@!460531752033845258> and <@456226577798135808> is harassing people.
creations-chat 2022-02-18 14:03:02 actually, I believe people just want to talk down on other people more than actually giving feedbacks, wouldn't change much if downvotes disappeared, slow mode too long im lazy to respond ðŸ—¿
creations-chat 2022-02-18 14:05:57 im trying to learn to not have an ego and actually get along with people not like all of u ðŸ—¿
creations-chat 2022-02-18 14:08:19 donâ€™t care + didnâ€™t ask + cry about it + stay mad + get real + L + cope harder + h0es mad + basic + skill issue + ratio + counter ratio + you fell off + the audacity + triggered + stay mad+ any askers + redpilled + get a life + ok and? + cringe + touch grass + donowalled + not based + yourâ€™re probably white + GG! + get good + go outside + not based + grammar issue + your're* + ad hominem + reported + you're a full time discordian + not funny didn't laugh + hahahahaha cry
creations-chat 2022-02-18 14:11:44 who's fault was it <:FineTroll:626841259746656289>, was it me not able to shut or was it people being toxic ðŸ—¿, also ur 4/14/2021 crazy dave post looks bad, could do better if u did motor lock and removes the disconnector rect prisms

help 2022-05-08 14:54:30 oh
help 2022-05-08 14:54:32 fireworks are
help 2022-05-08 14:54:33 eh?
help 2022-05-08 14:55:04 do this: put 2 fireworks side by side but 1 is spinning did u do that
help 2022-05-08 14:55:16 hmmm
help 2022-05-08 14:55:28 but does 1 explode first
help 2022-05-08 14:55:50 can u screnshot the test build u did
help 2022-05-08 14:56:08 I had really high hopes for spinning fireworks

help 2022-05-08 14:58:17 is there a contraption that possibly makes a forward motor but not move on the spot <@587047177558163466>
help 2022-05-08 14:58:30 like motor rotation
help 2022-05-08 14:59:13 what if rotation + forward movement boosts it
help 2022-05-08 14:59:19 instead of just plain forward movement
help 2022-05-08 14:59:26 since real battle takes place in movement
help 2022-05-08 15:00:02 how about fireworks
help 2022-05-08 15:00:31 they could've at least added a legacy option to fireworks
help 2022-05-08 15:00:46 or maybe it was that way from the beginning
help 2022-05-08 15:01:35 <@587047177558163466> another question, does spinning a block (with motor) messes up incoming rocket tracking
help 2022-05-08 15:02:46 a lot of people have been implementing this
help 2022-05-08 15:02:53 spinning objects on their builds
help 2022-05-08 15:03:04 that makes the rocket go different direction out of confusion
help 2022-05-08 15:03:14 I'll probably test it myself soon
help 2022-05-08 15:06:29 ok thanks for the info

help 2022-05-21 14:44:41 where
help 2022-05-21 14:44:43 i mean the turret
help 2022-05-21 14:45:20 yes

help 2022-05-25 12:50:54 trapdoor glitch
help 2022-05-25 12:51:17 when I use trap door on my build (maybe motor locked), it appears normal for me but for others the trap door is going crazy
help 2022-05-25 12:51:42 why
help 2022-05-25 14:00:49 no
help 2022-05-25 14:01:32 The glitch can't be experienced client side but clearly visible to other players
help 2022-05-25 14:01:50 So u never know when it happens
help 2022-05-25 14:02:32 my theory is motor lock + trap door = glitch but not client side
help 2022-05-25 14:03:09 The trapdoor either is in odd angle or starts spinning crazy on other player screen
help 2022-05-28 03:46:40 how do i prevent my tank's turret from getting a bit stuck when turning
help 2022-05-28 03:46:48 I've used ice
help 2022-05-28 03:46:55 I limited friction using wedges
help 2022-05-28 03:47:05 there is nothing blocking its way when turning
help 2022-05-28 03:47:12 (it turns on motor 2)
help 2022-05-28 06:33:58 can't
help 2022-05-28 06:34:11 the motor 2 freaks out if it is on top of a piston in any way
help 2022-05-28 06:34:19 I don't even know why
help 2022-05-28 06:37:02 it gets worse by the second
help 2022-05-28 06:37:45 but I will attempt anyways
help 2022-05-28 06:38:37 yeah didn't work
help 2022-05-28 06:38:42 keeps randomly spinning endlessly
help 2022-05-28 06:40:23 ok
help 2022-05-28 06:40:26 wait
help 2022-05-28 06:40:29 can't
help 2022-05-28 06:40:36 the bottom of my turret are half blocks
help 2022-05-28 06:40:55 and is put down by 1 motor lock
help 2022-05-28 06:41:13 it's smooth most of the time and sometimes gets a bit stuck then smooth again
help 2022-05-28 06:43:05 no
help 2022-05-28 06:43:10 all engines are below the hull
help 2022-05-28 06:43:23 so the hull is flat
help 2022-05-28 06:43:45 
help 2022-05-28 06:43:47 red is the hull
help 2022-05-28 06:44:00 it is pretty much flat
help 2022-05-28 06:44:07 the half blocks are all ice
help 2022-05-28 06:44:18 and wedges
help 2022-05-28 06:46:17 yes
help 2022-05-28 06:46:26 it is hollow inside
help 2022-05-28 06:46:41 there is nothing inside other than the outside layer of half block shell
help 2022-05-28 06:46:51 for the part that touches the hull
help 2022-05-28 06:47:12 then it will be see through
help 2022-05-28 06:47:17 but likely removes the problem too
help 2022-05-28 06:48:21 ok I found the main problem
help 2022-05-28 06:48:30 it's not the friction between the turret and the hull
help 2022-05-28 06:48:49 it's the actually the friction that causes the barrel to elevate downwards clamping the turret and the hull
help 2022-05-28 06:48:57 so it's barrel's problem
help 2022-05-28 06:55:30 after another test
help 2022-05-28 06:55:33 that was the wrong problem
help 2022-05-28 06:55:41 the turret didn't clamp down at all it still got stuck
help 2022-05-28 06:56:18 no
help 2022-05-28 06:56:28 my new theory is collision
help 2022-05-28 06:56:47 motor locking things together sometimes some things are not fully into each other maybe causes small friction problem
help 2022-05-28 07:00:45 wasn't that either
help 2022-05-28 07:01:10 the most motor lock collision things were either my top mounted gun or rockets, their were both removed and the small stuck behaviour is still there
help 2022-05-28 07:02:28 that brings back to square 1
help 2022-05-28 07:02:35 friction between the half blocks and hull
help 2022-05-28 07:02:42 because removing the half blocks removed this problem
bug-reports 2022-05-28 12:29:54 probably have already been reported but worth a shot, I was in a random public pvp server where the guns were glitched, the red bullets didn't came out for everyone there was only the yellow bullet in the guns, so shooting someone makes their builds invisible and look damaged but infact, on other player's view there is nothing happening

the-dump 2022-10-20 14:39:36 I mean, if you look at anime decades ago they are trash
the-dump 2022-10-20 14:40:06 you probably don't watch anime but you can have your opinion

the-dump 2022-10-20 14:40:45 azur lane?
the-dump 2022-10-20 14:41:47 I watch anime because I enjoy the intellectual entertainment
the-dump 2022-10-20 14:42:13 but they don't give me the feels of an anime
the-dump 2022-10-20 14:42:26 which one

the-dump 2022-10-20 14:43:46 those are the reasons why I watch anime it's interesting

the-dump 2022-10-20 14:44:34 no movie gives me the feel I get from animes

the-dump 2022-10-20 14:45:44 which is basically dynamite
the-dump 2022-10-20 14:45:54 lol they dont teach u anything
the-dump 2022-10-20 14:46:03 some anime actually teaches
the-dump 2022-10-20 14:46:10 go try, you can't
the-dump 2022-10-20 14:46:26 it teaches hell ton you just landed on the wrong one for your first
the-dump 2022-10-20 14:46:34 but I can because of anime
the-dump 2022-10-20 14:47:01 the anime deliberately warned the viewers all ingredients and crafts within the anime is real and do not attempt every episode, watch Dr Stones

the-dump 2022-10-20 14:52:22 that's not the point
the-dump 2022-10-20 14:52:28 not rewatching it
the-dump 2022-10-20 14:52:46 you enjoy it because you watched the anime and you are still able to think about it and enjoy it as much as when u watched it
the-dump 2022-10-20 14:53:35 but they are random stuff, imagine you get that but in a whole series, packs the punch much higher
the-dump 2022-10-20 14:53:45 I don't have a mic
the-dump 2022-10-20 14:53:55 give me math questions
the-dump 2022-10-20 14:54:22 I meant numerical
the-dump 2022-10-20 14:54:33 I don't know these definitions because English was not my first language
the-dump 2022-10-20 14:55:39 not at all
the-dump 2022-10-20 14:55:49 we're not talking about the scenes, but sure they are really cool as well
the-dump 2022-10-20 14:55:59 it's not always about the fighting
the-dump 2022-10-20 14:56:25 anime like 'Your Lie in April' is actually very good because of the impact it lands on you after you finished the anime
the-dump 2022-10-20 14:56:32 and there is absolutely no fighting
the-dump 2022-10-20 14:57:11 and movies like 'silent voice' is actually somewhat interesting and impactful
the-dump 2022-10-20 14:57:25 the further you go down into the movie the more things makes sense
the-dump 2022-10-20 14:58:47 try Eighty Six
the-dump 2022-10-20 14:59:11 it's about far in the future as well
the-dump 2022-10-20 14:59:38 or animes like 'Love is War', intense psychological warfare and intellect
the-dump 2022-10-20 15:00:26 Death Note is also one of those intellectual typed anime, outsmarting outsmart
the-dump 2022-10-20 15:01:23 'classroom of elite' is just speechlessly genius, no idea how the director pulls these stuff off
the-dump 2022-10-20 15:02:04 but it hits different in anime compared to movie that's undescribable in words for me
the-dump 2022-10-20 15:04:13 anime be like:
main character gives himself amnesia on purpose to dodge the intense interrogation and somehow with enough pre-instructions to reverse the effect
the-dump 2022-10-20 15:05:12 except that's just the base
the-dump 2022-10-20 15:05:43 there are anime directiors that directs a few animes
the-dump 2022-10-20 15:06:27 I wouldn't say all of them are as well but the ones I chose to watch are good for me
the-dump 2022-10-20 15:08:00 I think Saiki is better
the-dump 2022-10-20 15:08:52 I can't take the art style lol

help 2023-04-28 08:06:35 it's just illogical to think that super strength makes it stronger if u already have a strength bar u can set
help 2023-04-28 08:06:47 I've also heard somewhere that it doesnt make it much stronger
help 2023-04-28 08:07:16 I am not starting a petition
help 2023-04-28 08:07:20 I am questioning a functionality
help 2023-04-28 08:07:35 would he answer

help 2023-04-28 08:17:06 the magnet is weaker with super strength on
help 2023-04-28 08:17:39 any explanations
help 2023-04-28 08:17:50 you should know because you are a pro non-white name right
help 2023-04-28 08:37:41 wow ur so good
help 2023-04-28 08:37:48 but what u said earlier is false
help 2023-04-28 08:37:49 lol
help 2023-04-28 08:38:00 super strength "english" yeah about that it actually makes the magnet weaker
help 2023-04-28 08:38:15 test it yourself
help 2023-04-28 08:38:16 ðŸ•‹
help 2023-04-28 08:39:01 u don't need to know it to help me test it
help 2023-04-28 08:39:05 you are in the help channel
help 2023-04-28 08:39:52 I should because you are useless

help 2023-05-11 10:45:27 does anyone know how to make magnet engines accelerate and cap at a desired speed instead of it just accelerating forever
help 2023-05-11 11:00:14 but it has to be magnet
help 2023-05-11 11:00:19 someone has achieved it
help 2023-05-11 11:00:34 tho he doesn't play anymore and refuses to talk about plane crazy
creations-chat 2023-05-15 12:37:19 Actually, I changed to winter wheel in the latest modification, it now requires winter wheel to maintain its current steering capability

I will post latest performance and design soon
creations-chat 2023-05-15 12:40:13 it's not visible probably due to video quality but there is a trail connecting it
creations-chat 2023-05-15 12:45:02 I can add textblocks with black square emoji to make it more visible
creations-chat 2023-05-16 06:27:14 exhaust colour changed

btw it's fully capable of circuit racing if someone has a build that loads the circuit barriers
creations-chat 2023-05-16 06:30:01 stabilisers which are responsible for helping the bike lean and not fall over and tumble like any average bike if they tried to lean, this also really helps it with maneuvering for circuit typed racing
creations-chat 2023-05-16 10:06:46 it can off road but it's not supposed to as a track racing bike, it can cross terrain at around 150 speed and be stable (uses motor 2 suspensions)
creations-chat 2023-05-16 10:29:06 which one
creations-chat 2023-05-16 10:32:33 will he get warned
help 2023-05-17 16:27:20 are there any plane crazy engineers here that has experience with magnet engines
help 2023-05-17 16:37:48 yes but that is a really trash model
help 2023-05-17 16:39:32 motor lock is obsolete idiot <:trollface:775024642104229898>
help 2023-05-17 16:39:54 top tier pvp engineering has very little motor locking by now, it uses offset locking
help 2023-05-17 16:40:17 offset locking does what motor locking can do but motor locking can't do what offset locking can
help 2023-05-17 16:40:21 <:trollface:775024642104229898>
help 2023-05-17 16:40:49 performance is not liked here, so just say engineering instead
help 2023-05-18 00:21:48 the functions I side are not aircrafts
help 2023-05-18 00:22:23 I seek functions with practicality
help 2023-05-18 00:22:59 for example, a motor 2 suspension chassis system made for pvp tanks
help 2023-05-18 00:23:15 7 blocks wide pvp tanks, I don't enjoy oversized
help 2023-05-18 03:07:02 im not interested in over sized suspensions, they don't have any use other than for show
help 2023-05-18 03:07:14 my motor 2 suspension is being used in pvp tanks
help 2023-05-18 03:07:26 does he have a yt video showcase?
help 2023-05-18 03:07:39 what's his discord user
help 2023-05-18 03:08:07 where can I see his suspension
help 2023-05-18 03:14:42 does anyone know what does the magnet do if u turn off the 'lose parts only'
help 2023-05-18 03:15:07 what will trigger its attraction after that
help 2023-05-18 05:54:47 it apparently stopped attracting loose parts

bug-reports 2023-07-07 05:58:02 put 2 wedges
bug-reports 2023-07-07 05:58:06 and I got it
bug-reports 2023-07-07 05:59:11 u can't put a wedge above another one
bug-reports 2023-07-07 05:59:17 if u do u get it
bug-reports 2023-07-07 05:59:18 bruv
bug-reports 2023-07-07 06:02:41 
bug-reports 2023-07-07 06:02:48 I tried moving the entire build but the center of the build is
bug-reports 2023-07-07 06:02:55 not on my plot
bug-reports 2023-07-07 06:04:08 he's going to sleep
bug-reports 2023-07-07 06:04:14 he will fix tomorrow or something
bug-reports 2023-07-07 06:04:20 tbh wouldn't be bothered if he didn't
bug-reports 2023-07-07 06:04:33 I would rather he do pc2
bug-reports 2023-07-07 06:04:49 oh wait
bug-reports 2023-07-07 06:04:55 if u put a block on top of any block
bug-reports 2023-07-07 06:05:01 u disconnect
bug-reports 2023-07-07 06:05:02 lol
bug-reports 2023-07-07 06:06:17 o nvm it's cylinders and wedges for now
bug-reports 2023-07-07 06:06:34 and half blocks
bug-reports 2023-07-07 06:06:45 wedge, cylinders, half blocks, balls, pontoons
bug-reports 2023-07-07 06:07:19 they give u error code 69
bug-reports 2023-07-07 07:03:39 are you sure it isn't center of weight issue
bug-reports 2023-07-07 07:04:18 im gonna test my ship
bug-reports 2023-07-07 07:04:55 no issue
bug-reports 2023-07-07 07:04:59 no issue with pontoons
bug-reports 2023-07-07 07:05:05 my ship is still upright
bug-reports 2023-07-07 07:05:16 your center of weight is above your floating point so you are flipping over
bug-reports 2023-07-07 07:05:24 you need to lower your center of weight
bug-reports 2023-07-07 07:07:51 hold on
bug-reports 2023-07-07 07:08:01 <@217336009455566848> pontoons now float infinitely even out of water, making you ascend
bug-reports 2023-07-07 07:08:18 oh wait
bug-reports 2023-07-07 07:08:24 pontoons float on water
bug-reports 2023-07-07 07:08:28 but it doesn't stop floating
bug-reports 2023-07-07 07:08:34 it keeps going up even after out of water
bug-reports 2023-07-07 07:09:21 it didn't affect my military grade ship with a better stability, but civillian grade ships will now flip
bug-reports 2023-07-07 07:09:34 because pontoons will infinitely float
bug-reports 2023-07-07 07:09:35 new bug
bug-reports 2023-07-07 07:09:53 yes
bug-reports 2023-07-07 11:54:57 guns are phasing through blocks, they aren't stopping when hitting one block
bug-reports 2023-07-07 12:17:20 guns are damaging every block in line at the same time, phasing through all of them
bug-reports 2023-07-07 12:17:37 this isn't supposed to happen, as guns were previously stopped by one block and damages one at a time
bug-reports 2023-07-07 12:17:57 along with this, pontoons now infinitely float upwards once touching water
bug-reports 2023-07-07 12:18:10 these are the 2 notable bugs that needs to be fixed after this new update
bug-reports 2023-07-07 12:37:11 So far I've found that half block, wedge, cylinder and pontoons stacked upwards causes error 69
bug-reports 2023-07-07 12:37:42 also going to mention about the gun bug, it phases through and damaged everything instead of stopping at the initial block it hits
bug-reports 2023-07-07 12:41:02 a lot of new bugs after that performance update apparently
bug-reports 2023-07-07 12:44:42 u don't really need to, it's quite easy to explain
bug-reports 2023-07-07 12:46:09 u can put the block on any side of the following blocks: half block, wedge, cylinder and pontoon, except for the top of it. If you try to place another block on top of them, u wouldn't be able to as if something is already there, and if u do place it, which it will push it 1 block away sideways from the top of the block, then u get kicked
bug-reports 2023-07-07 12:51:06 wait I'll try
bug-reports 2023-07-07 12:51:51 half block is fixed
bug-reports 2023-07-07 12:52:04 maybe he was putting half block on top of a block that was still affected by error 69
bug-reports 2023-07-07 12:53:00 but there is still a bug where u can't place a wedge on top of another wedge directly
bug-reports 2023-07-07 12:53:07 that is the same for pontoon
bug-reports 2023-07-07 12:53:29 try putting a wedge on top of a wedge
bug-reports 2023-07-07 12:53:48 u'll find that u can't, it'll push ur wedge to a side
bug-reports 2023-07-07 12:54:02 6 sides, one of the sides doesn't allow u to stack on
bug-reports 2023-07-07 12:54:21 I'll show pic example of pontoon and wedge having this issue
bug-reports 2023-07-07 12:55:44 
bug-reports 2023-07-07 12:55:50 they get pushed aside
bug-reports 2023-07-07 12:55:58 you cannot put blocks directly on them
bug-reports 2023-07-07 12:56:15 previously, that would've resulted in error 69 but that is now fixed
bug-reports 2023-07-07 12:56:27 however, not being able to place on top of them is still an issue
bug-reports 2023-07-07 12:58:06 dont know
bug-reports 2023-07-07 12:58:12 doesn't seem to be
bug-reports 2023-07-07 12:58:19 Rick is trying to fix all these issues
bug-reports 2023-07-07 13:13:08 <@217336009455566848> u might as well fix this one while at it
bug-reports 2023-07-07 13:41:49 no, it was different before
bug-reports 2023-07-07 13:41:59 before this
bug-reports 2023-07-07 13:42:19 gun projectile actually stops at the initial block it hits, only then damages the next one after the initial one is destroyed
bug-reports 2023-07-07 13:42:32 I play plane crazy for pvp, so I know this one well
bug-reports 2023-07-07 13:43:10 I've done the tests
bug-reports 2023-07-07 13:43:20 I shot at a tnt armoured vehicle
bug-reports 2023-07-07 13:43:35 the gun's bullet went through the entire vehicle ignoring the block infront of it
bug-reports 2023-07-07 13:43:46 and killed the man inside along with damaging every block in its way all at the same time
bug-reports 2023-07-07 13:57:33 oh yeah I heard of that as well
bug-reports 2023-07-07 13:57:43 pistons being major source of lag recently
bug-reports 2023-07-07 15:32:52 all concept of armours flop due to new gun bug
bug-reports 2023-07-07 15:37:56 yes that too
bug-reports 2023-07-07 15:40:59 if we remember why PC2 is made over PC1, it's because PC1 is hardcoded, which means it's very difficult for rick to find and fix the errors, so this might take a while
bug-reports 2023-07-07 15:55:55 omg
bug-reports 2023-07-07 15:56:10 <@217336009455566848> I think plane crazy is starting to get a bug infestation
bug-reports 2023-07-07 15:56:17 even fireworks broke
bug-reports 2023-07-07 15:56:41 when u fire them, the fireworks projectile actually shoot somewhere away from the fireworks block
bug-reports 2023-07-07 15:57:01 and the faster u move, the further the projectile starts from the block
bug-reports 2023-07-07 15:57:10 in like random positions idk
bug-reports 2023-07-07 15:57:34 they were working so fine earlier today
bug-reports 2023-07-07 15:57:50 maybe we should collect a list of bugs
bug-reports 2023-07-07 16:05:49 it's urgent and he should know about it, so that's most likely reasonable
bug-reports 2023-07-07 16:06:13 there's a lot of bugs going on after recent update
bug-reports 2023-07-07 16:06:25 if he isn't aware of it, we'll let him be aware of it
bug-reports 2023-07-07 16:06:39 we're the players he's the developer, that's how we work together to make a game great
bug-reports 2023-07-07 16:07:58 probably problem with PC1's coding
bug-reports 2023-07-07 16:08:03 PC1 is hardcoded afterall
bug-reports 2023-07-07 16:09:01 this bug alone halted an entire pvp community
bug-reports 2023-07-07 16:09:25 literally most of the battles cannot be conducted
bug-reports 2023-07-07 19:44:19 well everything is breaking
bug-reports 2023-07-07 19:44:28 bug infestation
bug-reports 2023-07-08 03:20:36 so you're saying it's normal for it's bullet to start midair
bug-reports 2023-07-08 03:21:02 no, clearly not, as a pvp'er that uses fireworks every pvp ever I can tell u
bug-reports 2023-07-08 03:21:06 bullets don't start midair
bug-reports 2023-07-08 03:21:12 but from the gun
bug-reports 2023-07-08 10:11:16 gun blocks also need to be fixed, they are damaging everything in line all at the same time
bug-reports 2023-07-08 10:11:35 before this update, they can only damage 1 block at a time
bug-reports 2023-07-08 10:11:44 after this update, they are going through everything
bug-reports 2023-07-08 11:12:14 that's a minor problem
bug-reports 2023-07-08 11:12:41 main issues that are still on going is piston lag, error code 69 and gun block bug
bug-reports 2023-07-08 13:04:53 yes they are going through everything and damaging them while at it
bug-reports 2023-07-08 13:05:24 which is not how it's supposed to work, new update caused some unnoticeable bugs that is changing the game in bad way
bug-reports 2023-07-10 08:19:36 ?
bug-reports 2023-07-11 07:29:40 or 25 drag disabled hover engines
bug-reports 2023-07-12 01:43:16 water propeller continues to provide thrust even after going out of water
bug-reports 2023-07-14 14:24:46 guns are still bugged
bug-reports 2023-07-14 14:24:55 it's bypassing blocks
