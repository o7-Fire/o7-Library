help 2019-06-30 03:37:13 <@!587393222855229457> I mean, it's not that of a big deal. If someone copied you, you should know that they think you have a cool plane/ship/car/train. So you should be proud of yourself someone likes your creations a lot.
help 2019-06-30 03:37:44 But the bad thing is they can say "I made it"
help 2019-06-30 03:37:49 If they say it, it's kind of a big deal
help 2019-06-30 03:37:52 as long as they credit you.

Why isn't this plane going up? And sometimes it just flips.
help 2020-06-08 04:42:17 Sorry, I'm pretty new to plane making, so.

my plane works fine with flying.

But my plane won't "go" up when I'm going full speed. I have to hit some kind of rock to make it fly up. How can I make my plane "go" up when driving? Basically, it won't takeoff. It only takes off when I hit something or when I go down or something like that
help 2020-06-09 20:16:45 Ping me when you can find the answer for my question. (And yes, obviously I have landing gears)

Okay, so somehow I got into a guy's area, which he blacklisted me.

This is a bug because you shouldn't be able to get inside the red box, which somehow I got into. So I don't know how this is not a bug..

help 2020-06-14 22:17:54 Well the job of it is to keep the mech to the ground with the help of helium
help 2020-06-14 22:18:01 Either way without the rocket engine, it still walks backward
help 2020-06-14 22:18:35 Without the front wedge, it still walks backwards
help 2020-06-14 22:22:32 I fixed it
help 2020-06-14 22:22:39 It was because of the helium blocks on the back.
help 2020-06-14 22:22:42 I put them in the front instead.

EVEN WITHOUT THE 2 SMALL ROCKETS, IT'S STILL FLIPS
