help 2023-04-29 13:47:54 can anyone tell me why this wont move up? green is motor, red is anchor block (physics off), the motor is powered and locked btw

when i launch, the motor wont move but when i unanchor, the base of the motor moves (thus moving the anchor block as well)

**THERES NO OTHER ANCHOR BLOCKS IN THIS BUILD**
