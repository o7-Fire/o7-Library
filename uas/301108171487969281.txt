the-dump 2020-05-25 12:36:48 glitch that can be fixed with a reload, still very irritating
bug-reports 2020-05-27 15:15:17 you can fix that by saving and reloading
bug-reports 2020-05-27 15:15:19 that fixed it for me
bug-reports 2020-05-27 15:15:25 but i got a horrible bug to report
bug-reports 2020-05-27 15:16:16 my recently finished sphere
bug-reports 2020-05-27 15:16:24 took me three days to finish completely
bug-reports 2020-05-27 15:16:35 i havent even launched it yet
bug-reports 2020-05-27 15:16:42 then when i turn it to glass and then reload
bug-reports 2020-05-27 15:16:52 
bug-reports 2020-05-27 15:16:54 glass version
bug-reports 2020-05-27 15:17:12 then when i reloaded it

bug-reports 2020-05-27 15:17:25 its COMPLETELY BROKEN
bug-reports 2020-05-27 15:18:11 this is the first time something like this has happened to me
bug-reports 2020-05-27 15:18:16 i cant reload it correctly
bug-reports 2020-05-27 15:18:22 it reloads like this every time
bug-reports 2020-05-27 15:18:48 this is the block count
bug-reports 2020-05-27 15:18:49 
bug-reports 2020-05-27 15:19:08 even though the block count is like that, it wont load correctly
bug-reports 2020-05-27 15:19:39 when i re-save it, this is the block count
bug-reports 2020-05-27 15:19:41 
bug-reports 2020-05-27 15:19:54 i need some help on this
bug-reports 2020-05-27 15:19:57 can anyone help me?

bug-reports 2020-05-27 15:39:13 thank you
bug-reports 2020-05-27 15:40:35 thats weird
bug-reports 2020-05-27 15:40:38 ill try reloading it now
bug-reports 2020-05-27 15:40:45 uh
bug-reports 2020-05-27 15:40:52 thats the wrong save file
bug-reports 2020-05-27 15:40:59 slot 25 is the one that needs to be fixed
bug-reports 2020-05-27 15:41:20 its supposed to be a sphere
bug-reports 2020-05-27 15:41:24 but instead it looks like this
bug-reports 2020-05-27 15:41:48 
bug-reports 2020-05-27 15:41:49 this is what i see
bug-reports 2020-05-27 15:42:00 its not
bug-reports 2020-05-27 15:42:01 
bug-reports 2020-05-27 15:42:06 i reload it multiple times and its still broken
bug-reports 2020-05-27 15:42:08 yes im in game
bug-reports 2020-05-27 15:42:24 i even made another save of this broken state and it has 1334 parts
bug-reports 2020-05-27 15:45:14 alright
bug-reports 2020-05-27 15:45:49 oh great roblox update
bug-reports 2020-05-27 15:46:01 maybe that has something to do with it
bug-reports 2020-05-27 15:46:22 almost updated
bug-reports 2020-05-27 15:46:34 joining now
bug-reports 2020-05-27 15:47:58 well
bug-reports 2020-05-27 15:48:16 now i forever have one save of a sphere and one save of a broken sphere, thanks for the help rickje
bug-reports 2020-05-27 15:48:49 ooooh i just remembered
bug-reports 2020-05-27 15:49:02 i ran out of normal blocks so i used paint blocks for the remainder of the build
bug-reports 2020-05-27 15:49:09 maybe that has something to do with the temporary corruption
bug-reports 2020-05-27 15:49:25 all the 1x4s and 1x7s loaded
bug-reports 2020-05-27 15:49:28 along with all of the paint blocks
bug-reports 2020-05-27 15:49:43 just normal blocks didnt load, thats interesting
bug-reports 2020-05-27 15:50:08 the broken sphere has 0 normal blocks
bug-reports 2020-05-27 15:50:10 
bug-reports 2020-05-27 15:51:04 also i saved about 2500 blocks by using 1x4s and 1x7s
