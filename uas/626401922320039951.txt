creations-chat 2023-01-30 21:19:32 Just looks goofy dude 
Can probally use more softer colors that mix on the wagon, try to use materials (Wheels that are just black look bad) . Make the black parts of the wagon a little bit grayish. Use darker wood for the tables, and maybe put some food on them ? (Use emojis for food) 

P.s : You don't have to use motorlock for a build to look good
creations-chat 2023-01-30 21:23:17 You can bypass emojis by just putting a letter next to it (Ex : ü•ò m) Pro tip : crank the scale up to 100

Since you are making this build as a learning experience, you can just save this to another slot and try using materials on it (Ex : Use metal on the body of the wagon, maybe use diamondplate on the linings, etc.)

Using materials adds life to your builds
