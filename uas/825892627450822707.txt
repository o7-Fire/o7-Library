creations-chat 2022-01-17 18:58:21 make window smaller by using piston and motor locks. and maybe remove this thing on turret or make smaller :/ like 1.5x1.5

creations-chat 2023-05-15 18:35:17 banned!
<@554026870912581643> thanks for feedback but its only wip cus only done with it.
only one thing left somehow build it on other save file where hull :/

ig its gonna be easier if i will build hull on save file with turret
creations-chat 2023-05-15 18:37:36 missiles üëç
creations-chat 2023-05-15 18:44:39 and hull, used camera locking for frontal part.
still wip so dont blame me

btw asymmetrical ü´°
creations-chat 2023-05-15 18:46:40 turret above in this chat
now i need to connect them :/
creations-chat 2023-05-15 18:50:43 i was doing turret at test slot but made working and because of its size i cant copy and paste it in other slot
<@986395564126134363> use motorlocks and camera locks (camera locks kinda buggy so be careful) and dont forget about emojies and signs and text signs.
creations-chat 2023-07-11 20:31:04 any suggestions what to add or fix?
still wip so dont ask to add wheels cus i will do it in future
its T-80bvm
creations-chat 2023-07-11 20:34:18 ok i will try thanks
creations-chat 2023-07-11 20:49:03 Imposible due to no space<:noway:1021283202561744977>
creations-chat 2023-07-11 21:03:09 By adding blocks on back to hide motorlocks i will not be able to move turret or horizontal degrees of turning will decrease. Maximum that i can add barrels on back
creations-chat 2023-07-11 21:05:13 Good idea but only turret took 100% of vertical space, i mean i cant place blocks on top. I will try adding extra motor locking to add machine gun but i dont think its gonna work
creations-chat 2023-07-11 21:17:30 atleast i closed some of motors
creations-chat 2023-07-11 21:23:29 Im bad at coloring so idk but i will try something
