help 2019-05-18 13:58:18 How does one submit a creation?
creations-chat 2019-05-18 14:12:42 My Delta Fighter, 567 going flat 553 going straight up, can do a complete u turn in 2 seconds and turn around in a complete circle in 5 seconds. You can also kill the engines to have it glide while retaining most of its altitude at a speed of 10.
help 2019-05-19 00:30:43 How do I the ranks for builds
help 2019-05-19 00:31:18 and <@!505835349889777685> may I reccomend making small pontoons, that keeps narrow ships from capsising

bug-reports 2019-06-07 20:03:27 https://gyazo.com/23ff2d7874ba3d90bff2be2d29c14b6b The control surfaces nearest the camera are manually controlled, the ones further from the camera are auto. The front ones are inverted and make the plane impossible to fly. It worked previously.
bug-reports 2019-06-07 20:04:09 And by worked previously I mean that the further ones acted as a elevator and rotated it, now they act as a elevator.
bug-reports 2019-06-07 20:04:20 Back ones when set to auto also behave like a elevator
bug-reports 2019-06-07 20:07:09 Please clarify.

bug-reports 2019-06-07 20:14:10 I'm going to delete and build a exact replica and see if that fixes anything
bug-reports 2019-06-07 20:17:55 Ok, I built a perfect replica and it works
bug-reports 2019-06-07 20:18:17 The old config was messed up after the update I assume
creations-chat 2019-06-09 19:56:33 Submission for novice

My version of the F-86 F2 Sabre, I used the real life sabre and made it into a vehicle for plane crazy, it could be better looking however as I mainly play PVP it has more emphasis on performance rather than looks. Top speed 557 in level flight and made of 160 blocks.
creations-chat 2019-06-09 20:02:05 ok gimmie a second

bug-reports 2019-08-02 17:05:14 There is currently a game breaking bug
bug-reports 2019-08-02 17:05:31 Near impossible to film so I will try describing it
bug-reports 2019-08-02 17:07:18 If you shoot off part of a players vehicle it will remain still in the air and floating, you can interact with it and visually destroy parts but it is all client sided. Sometimes the entire vehicle will have this. On the server the actual vehicle keeps flying and you can shoot and damage it, but its all inviable to you. The vehicle while invisible can still damage you and its like bullets and rockets appearing out of nowhere
bug-reports 2019-08-02 17:07:58 A seat without a player is all that remains that visually moves sometimes
bug-reports 2019-08-02 17:18:58 Got a video of it
bug-reports 2019-08-02 17:22:19 To recreate it just shoot at something and it will happen sometimes
bug-reports 2019-08-02 17:22:46 I will screenshot debug menu next time it happens
bug-reports 2019-08-02 17:27:44 Rejoining seemed to help as I was able to complete a fight without it happening
bug-reports 2019-08-02 17:31:43 A video of it happening can be found here when my slow internet uploads it
