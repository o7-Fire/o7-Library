the-dump 2021-01-31 20:52:43 what number even is that
bug-reports 2021-02-03 03:55:23 You can do this one very easily. If you have control surfaces on a wing (sort of like pictured idk if it does it with any other setup) but every time I reload the plane (spawning it, despawning it, then spawning it again) the direction of the control surfaces switch. Position the mouse near the top and the red ones go down but the blue ones go up. Reload the plane. Position mouse in the same spot, Red ones go up blue ones go down. Why do they do this lmao
bug-reports 2021-02-03 03:56:29 no
bug-reports 2021-02-03 03:56:35 ive done that over 10 times
bug-reports 2021-02-03 03:56:50 did that

bug-reports 2021-02-03 04:11:06 but its still doing the same thing
bug-reports 2021-02-03 04:11:16 even though they all look the same
