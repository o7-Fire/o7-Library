creations-chat 2020-06-20 14:05:46 Brub wbat happened there
creations-chat 2020-06-20 14:06:09 The piston is unpowered
creations-chat 2020-06-20 14:06:26 Not alwyad
creations-chat 2020-06-20 14:06:28 Always
creations-chat 2020-06-20 14:06:38 It depends on the build
creations-chat 2020-06-20 14:07:06 Im guessing around 5k speed for a medium size plane
creations-chat 2020-06-20 14:07:49 I dont use conveyor so i don't really know its lagginess and stuff
creations-chat 2020-06-20 14:07:55 Its too hard to control for me
creations-chat 2020-06-20 14:08:12 Plus maneuvering with conveyor drive is literally gay
creations-chat 2020-06-20 14:08:23 Tight turns are impossible
creations-chat 2020-06-20 14:08:43 Conveyor good for lile submarine and big aircraft
creations-chat 2020-06-20 14:08:58 For aircraft of the medium size i reccomend super rockets
creations-chat 2020-06-20 14:09:19 Oh a rocket
creations-chat 2020-06-20 14:09:38 Yes i said big
creations-chat 2020-06-20 14:14:38

creations-chat 2020-06-20 14:14:54 Its more maneuverable at low speeds
creations-chat 2020-06-20 14:15:00 But its not too fast

creations-chat 2020-07-28 05:54:55 you think kids will become murderers by making tanks?
creations-chat 2020-07-28 05:56:00 even though its a weapon you think kids will get a bad influence by making tanks?

the-dump 2020-09-24 13:33:23 it literally splits its body showing a mouth and impales you with its tounge
the-dump 2020-09-24 13:33:35 the imposter is a shape shifting alien
the-dump 2020-09-24 13:33:41 its literally the lore
the-dump 2020-09-24 13:33:59 👍
the-dump 2020-09-24 13:34:35 According to the official website, the Impostor is confirmed to be an alien, (as in, a different species from the Crewmates), and is confirmed as a parasitic shapeshifter (But beware...as there may be an alien impostor aboard! One crewmate has been replaced by a parasitic shapeshifter.). It is further implied from the following reasons:
One of the impostor's attack animations depicts them opening their rather large mouth full of razor-sharp teeth, then impaling the targeted crewmate's head with their spear-like tongue, killing them.
The Impostors will win if the ship's oxygen is depleted, implying that the Impostors can survive without oxygen.
Getting scanned at the MedBay is perhaps the most well-known way of proving yourself a Crewmate, implying that the Impostor doesn't want the Crewmates or the ship's systems to know about their anatomy.
When a Crewmate gets killed on the Polus map, the Impostor's pulse on Vital Signs Machine (Simsong) doesn't increase at all from stress or guilt. 
True or not, some pets are alien lifeforms.

bot-central 2020-09-24 22:00:12 -mapsuggest for the new map, why dont add a forest and a little town with natural scenery. This would make ground combat alot more fun. Also make larger oceans because the water we have now is kinda small. And mabye add a new road  and bridges and tunnels that go around the map to make ground vehicles alot more fun to play with.
bot-central 2020-09-24 22:03:25 yeah sorta
bot-central 2020-09-24 22:03:47 i would like a destroyable town but that could be problematic in public pvp
bot-central 2020-09-24 22:04:06 since shredders and random bombing
bot-central 2020-09-24 22:04:07 yeah
bot-central 2020-09-24 22:04:32 they are if you have a good thing to counter it

creations-chat 2020-10-15 15:19:14 tail rotor yes
but tail rotor isnt counted as a part of the swashplate so not swashplate
creations-chat 2020-10-15 15:21:39 yes tail rotor is used for yaw
creations-chat 2020-10-15 15:23:50 since the torque of the main rotor produces yaw in one way and the tail rotor is used to counter it, you can just increases or decrease the tail rotor power. I know this i was asking if you could produce yaw with just a swashplate and no tail rotor

creations-chat 2020-10-19 05:31:42 too make roll better make the roll surfaces have the same wingspan as the wing or make it far away from the body
creations-chat 2020-10-19 05:35:28 > as far away from the body means more leverage but slower and closer to the body means less leverage and more speed <@!447221768520859659>
> aka outer means constant and slow and inner means takes time to accelerate a bit and rolls real fucking fast
i thought it was the other way around
actually nvm i get what you mean
creations-chat 2020-10-19 05:38:50 yeah i get it
if its closer in it rolls faster but cant roll a whole lot
if its farther out it rolls slower but can do barrel rolls and stuff

creations-chat 2020-10-25 10:40:19 a tip for new players, don't post anything in creations until you can get to a point where you can be considered good. If you do you are just gonna get destroyed by the community
creations-chat 2020-10-25 10:41:54 I get that hes new but you guys don't have to shoot him down like that, hes new and still learning
creations-chat 2020-10-25 10:44:28 i know self upvoting is bad, but you guys literally don't have to destroy the guy that hard just cause he self upvoted
creations-chat 2020-10-25 10:48:51 > i mean, there are 2 good sides to the story, yes he is new and that could genuinely be a good creation to a new player, and would feel proud and deserves it should be posted, but on the other hand, I, for example, when posted my build, a ship, (i really dont mean to sound selfish here) I was hoping it would have a good chance at upvotes, immediately after, whateevr that is under mine got posted, sent it up.. then a couple of other good builds, which im ok with, but then a low effort build that I could probably make in less than half a minute gets posted, sending it up in the chat even more...

just suddenly everyone and their families are making phantoms
bug-reports 2021-01-12 22:35:33 yes locked motors with powered on just give up sometimes
bug-reports 2021-01-12 22:35:38 or just fall off
bug-reports 2021-01-12 22:35:52 theyll correct themselves later but its still annoying
creations-chat 2021-01-13 06:17:41 yum
creations-chat 2021-01-13 15:04:25 morgans tails have an inward angle, not an outward angle
creations-chat 2021-01-13 22:12:04 you can see the tons of motorlock in the back
he motorlocked the 4 trails half a block each towards the sparkler, which requires alot of motorlock to do
creations-chat 2021-01-13 22:15:59 but it had more effort then the build symion posted
creations-chat 2021-01-13 22:18:48 i mean you can clearly see the effort difference between the 2 builds
Just because it's small doesnt mean its low effort
creations-chat 2021-01-13 22:21:12 so youre saying having to motorlock all those trails half a block whilst still making the motorlock tower 1 wide takes seconds?
the-dump 2021-01-14 01:43:54 they can get 1 tapped by a power 5 bow
the-dump 2021-01-14 01:45:06 yeah those are hacks

creations-chat 2021-02-26 03:54:20 but the bomb itself wasnt practical, sure it was big but delivering it was the hard part. They couldnt put it on an ICBM because of the warhead size, so the bomb was made to mostly scare america

creations-chat 2021-04-05 05:43:25 when big builds have exposed motorlock it wont be noticed or will add to the minor details

When small build such as jets have exposed motorlock, it should be smooth without any protrusions. Exposed motorlock ruins that smooth look
creations-chat 2021-04-05 05:45:43 Hidden motorlock shows how much effort you put into hiding the motorlocks

Its better than having 2 pegs on a smooth wing
creations-chat 2021-04-05 05:48:21 i put effort into hiding my motorlocks
creations-chat 2021-04-05 05:53:35 First of all, the turret cheeks are 2 blocks wide and the the mantlet is 2 blocks tall, meaning i have to motorlock the barrel half a block in the mantlet. To make sure the cheeks don't collide with the mantlet and gun i used custom angled 1x2 wing panels at the angle of 1x2 wedges to make it have space for the turret. The turret width isnt just in 1x1s or half blocks. The turret has to be piston locked to be on the same surface as the cheeks

It isnt as easy as just putting a motor to make the barrel elevate
And all that motorlock has to be hidden in a 2 block tall space

cobras are impossible to pull of in pc due to the lack of inertia

creations-chat 2021-04-07 06:13:57 you didnt continue to move forward either, the speed bar measures your speed depending on how fast your character is going regardless of its vertical or horizontal speed, that 80 sps you said was your vertical speed and 100 altitude in plane crazy is still alot, what you did was just a sudden pitch up to slow down, not a cobra

once again pulling a proper cobra in plane crazy in impossible due to the lack of inertia
creations-chat 2021-04-07 06:20:04 you claimed it was  ***proper*** cobra when it wasnt
creations-chat 2021-04-07 06:24:51 ***"during which the aircraft does not change effective altitude."***
even if you did continue forward it was at a very slow speed, once again the sps meter measures your speed regardless if its vertical or horizontal
creations-chat 2021-04-07 06:27:50 that quote was taken from wikipedia plus ill say it again, the sps meter doesnt only measure horizontal speed, that 80 sps was your vertical speed and you didnt go 520 sps while in the nose up position
creations-chat 2021-04-07 06:30:46 you can clearly see here it went up and came back to its original altitude
creations-chat 2021-04-07 06:33:00 even if they do gain altitude its not significant enough to be noticed, your scale and altitude gained was significant enough to be noticed
creations-chat 2021-04-07 06:35:14 here even if i say your altitude gain wasnt that much, you barely even continued forward during the nose up position, thats why the altitude gain was so noticable

no it just annoys me when people claim to do a cobra when its impossible to do so in plane crazy due to the lack of inertia
creations-chat 2021-04-07 06:39:49 https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/515766334865539074/829243840875069450/IMG_20210407_133845.jpg what you did was this. you barely continued forward after the nose up and that made the altitude gain very noticable

creations-chat 2021-04-07 06:57:36 he went from 900 to 1000????????

thats modifying your plane to do 1 maneuver and kinda defeats the whole reason

creations-chat 2021-06-24 15:14:43 theyre just tired of having the pride flag thrown at their faces

If youre lgbtq just keep it to yourself so people wont comment on you
creations-chat 2021-06-24 15:18:48 I don't know how saying to keep being lgbtq to yourself is discriminating
creations-chat 2021-06-24 15:22:34 By putting a trans flags on your build you are basically just flexing your gender, i have no fucking clue how it causes problems to you and its just annoying to keep seeing this same flag and people always defending it like their life depends on it

I also dont see a problem about not being so open about your sexuality, just dont be so open about it and people wont judge. Same goes for weebs or furries alike
creations-chat 2021-06-24 15:25:47 I dont put anime faces on all of my builds, or say an anime reference every 2 seconds, thats how i avoid being judged for a weeb
creations-chat 2021-06-24 15:28:14 The fact you **chose** something like being trans to represent your wholeself is why people dislike lgbtq so much, you dont base your whole personality or life over being trans. Its just wrong.

pcc can sometimes be so hypocritical it hurts my brain
creations-chat 2021-06-29 06:49:45 stfu pcc is like "oh its your first build, it looks shit go delete it we dont care its your first build." "oh is that a some copy pasted pizza recipe on a wall, incredible build 10/10 upvoted"

creations-chat 2021-06-29 07:16:15 of course were arguing when OUR builds that we worked HARD on gets beaten in upvotes BY SOME RANDOM SHITTY MINECRAFT BUILD
creations-chat 2021-06-29 07:18:49 first of all, downvoting builds because you dont like the creator is warnable and please shut the fuck up, you dont understand the amount of frustration you get when a build LIKE THAT gets more upvotes than a build you worked for days on

creations-chat 2021-06-29 07:38:01 i dont care about what people build, if they choose to build that its fine. i dont blame the creator but the shit community thats so hypocritical it hurts my brain.
creations-chat 2021-06-29 07:40:40 i only get mad over them because the same community that told people to delete their builds because it was shit even though it was their first is upvoting and praising the hell out of a meme build that probably the took the same amount of time to build
creations-chat 2021-06-29 07:46:30 looks decent so far, add more details to the roof and stuff though, it looks plain

creations-chat 2022-06-28 04:34:24 lack of motivation to finish anything 💀

the main motivation for my f16 was the experimental plane contest

creations-chat 2022-06-29 15:11:06 the f35 has a 25mm gun while the GAU 8 is 30💀

im dumb sorry
creations-chat 2022-06-29 15:13:53 yeah the a10 is all good and shit because it fights against enemies that cant shoot back at it

30mms wont evaporate a tank at any angle and the a10 is literally slower than a fucking ww2 aircraft

creations-chat 2022-07-02 19:39:18 that doesnt stop people taking it to heart

if you show something you created and proud of to some random stranger and they say "you should destroy it" or "get it out of my face its shit" you arent gonna walk away feeling good
creations-chat 2022-07-02 19:45:46 so? it being lego doesnt just magically make people stop not feeling good after someone verbally abuses them

if you find a "bad build" you dont have to call them out and talk shit about them, just dont say anything and move on with your day
creations-chat 2022-07-02 19:56:13 saying that youre new wont matter, my suggestion is to just not post any builds here until youve gotten somewhat "good", and if you do wanna post your builds, do it somewhere more welcoming
creations-chat 2022-07-02 19:58:50 i never said the build was bad, i put good in quotation marks for a reason

creations-chat 2022-07-05 15:37:05 rotors that have an unpowered motor and spin using engines dont have any torque

thats why so many people make them like that
if you want to experience real torque, make a non coaxial rotor that spins using a powered motor

it causes yaw not roll
creations-chat 2022-07-05 16:12:01 that doesnt disprove my first point of a rotor with unpowered motors makes no torque
creations-chat 2022-07-05 16:16:35 rolling torque doesnt exist 

In the video you sent, the roll isnt caused by the rotor, even with coax rotors it does the same. I cant really explain it but thats just how helicopters work in pc
creations-chat 2022-07-05 16:19:00 and in real life too, tip jet rotors create no torque either
creations-chat 2022-07-05 16:22:08 it isnt similar, your helicopter isnt violently yawing in the other direction and its much easier to control than a powered non coax with a tail rotor
creations-chat 2022-07-05 16:27:26 yeah you wouldnt but that isnt my point, tip jet rotors in pc and dont have torque was my original point

and they also dont have torque irl too

the upvotes and downvotes are there as secondary
creations-chat 2022-09-09 08:52:30 so?

honestly i dont even make most of my builds for performance anymore
at least they work is all i need

+they usually only take a 1-2 weeks at most
people who say they took months procrastinate a ton and only built like once or twice per week
creations-chat 2022-09-14 04:48:16 you havent changed what i said before
the ufp angle is too flat

make the ufp shorter so its angle becomes steeper

the roadwheels also seem too big

its good if you want to make small detailed things, however any angle locking with magnet lock wont work
unless you want to keep the angled motor which just makes it normal motorlock

however you cant really remove the magnet sticking everything, so unless you got a good position for it, its gonna be sticking out
creations-chat 2022-10-14 11:02:29 you push the magnet into the thing with a piston

i spent like a day on the canopy alone

maybe i can find a way later but for now ill keep it like that
