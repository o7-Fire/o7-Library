creations-chat 2022-11-08 23:19:26 nah
creations-chat 2022-11-08 23:23:27 considering i never use this server probably
creations-chat 2022-11-09 01:01:02 alright
creations-chat 2022-11-09 02:09:58 better than what i can do

creations-chat 2022-11-11 03:43:40 needs more neon pink and then it looks like a real man jet <:trollface:775024642104229898>
creations-chat 2022-11-12 17:34:55 lmfao the hate is real
creations-chat 2022-11-12 17:37:51 the only thing people upvote are fucking planes and tanks
creations-chat 2022-11-12 17:40:07 yeah
creations-chat 2022-11-12 17:42:14 I'll correct myself, the only thing people upvote are motor lock builds that don't have exposed locks. nobody likes old fashioned shit.
creations-chat 2022-11-12 17:44:31 I don't care how "low effort" it looks, I put my time and effort into her. I guess its just the ego that these people have. "oh it looks low effort so i will downvote it". this is exactly like the starscape discord server. the reason it got shut down is because the veteran players were extremely and indiscriminately toxic to the newer players of the community. the whole server is in read only
creations-chat 2022-11-12 17:46:41 if something "sucks and is low effort" you are supposed to give Positive critical feedback to tell them how to improve, not bring down their self esteem by telling them their build is shit
creations-chat 2022-11-12 17:48:44 i know my build is low quality, i have no idea how to improvise and improve on detail and quality of building. i never said my build was the best build ever. this "argument" is done. i do not wish to incite toxicity any further.
creations-chat 2022-11-12 17:50:48 if its not good, Please tell me how i can further improve on detail in the future. i would absolutely be so grateful to know
creations-chat 2022-11-12 17:53:58 ill take that into consideration thanks
creations-chat 2022-11-12 19:18:14 damn thats sad as hell.
creations-chat 2022-11-12 19:50:34 holy shit bro its an argument from 12:00 this morning stop replying to what i said the argument ended
creations-chat 2022-11-12 19:53:33 yeah *stops shitting*
creations-chat 2022-11-12 19:58:23 <#705941616199991307>
creations-chat 2022-11-16 20:35:02 i asked for positive feedback not negative. please refer to the channel description before you are potentially escalated/striked/warned.
creations-chat 2022-11-16 20:37:31 I apologize for the inconvenience of being unproportionate, I myself have never been strong in proportioning objects in various shapes and sizes to scale exactly with a model.
creations-chat 2022-11-16 20:40:02 Thanks for the positive message. I will reshape the entire front of the ship over time, and work on enlargement of the turrets. curving the front tower was very difficult and in the future, I will experiment on angles, and curves. <@291284163762323457> I will look into more versions of 3d rendered models of ships.
creations-chat 2022-11-16 20:47:37 <:deshawn:999634590597656656>
creations-chat 2022-11-16 20:52:20 I appreciate the.. sorta positive message. Look I've never been much of a builder. IRL I work as a cook, not an architect. I only play games like these to pass time, or to enjoy spending time with family. I did not know that the guns were decommissioned. Yes, I do not like derogatory language unless used in a form of joke.
