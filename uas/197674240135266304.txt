plane-crazy 2020-03-25 08:28:54 make it lower for the best ricer experience
plane-crazy 2020-03-24 07:24:23 Most promimently used for climbing during the age of sails
plane-crazy 2020-03-24 07:24:03 Theyre also used to climb up the mast
plane-crazy 2020-03-24 07:22:17 er
plane-crazy 2020-03-24 07:21:59 Boom is a term related to sails and masts
plane-crazy 2020-03-24 07:15:01 no
plane-crazy 2020-03-24 07:14:51 If you cant have sails, then just dont add it
plane-crazy 2020-03-24 07:13:08 Well, I dont know about that
plane-crazy 2020-03-24 07:13:03 Ah, the mizzen mast, you mean?
plane-crazy 2020-03-24 07:12:35 Foremast?
plane-crazy 2020-03-24 07:12:31 Main mast?
plane-crazy 2020-03-24 07:12:28 Uh, can you actually point out which or which?
plane-crazy 2020-03-24 07:11:50 SAIL MASTS LIKE THESE HAVE TRIANGULAR SAILS
plane-crazy 2020-03-24 07:11:36 THERE'S LITERALLY AN OUTLINE
plane-crazy 2020-03-24 07:11:13 that's it
plane-crazy 2020-03-24 07:11:10 Just make triangles
plane-crazy 2020-03-24 07:10:45 Like this
plane-crazy 2020-03-24 07:10:13 From that image, try imagining it as a bermuda sloop
plane-crazy 2020-03-24 07:09:47 find the guy
plane-crazy 2020-03-24 07:09:19 find it then
plane-crazy 2020-03-24 07:09:12 then find it
plane-crazy 2020-03-24 07:08:45 find one and sail it
plane-crazy 2020-03-24 07:08:39 just go to the nearest docks
plane-crazy 2020-03-24 07:07:53 Im not someone who knows anything about yachts
plane-crazy 2020-03-24 07:07:44 I have no idea what that is
plane-crazy 2020-03-24 07:05:58 have a sail folded, and the other not folded
plane-crazy 2020-03-24 07:05:50 have all of them
plane-crazy 2020-03-24 07:05:30 two birds with one stone
plane-crazy 2020-03-24 07:05:22 just have all of them
plane-crazy 2020-03-24 07:04:05 Why decide when you can have all of them
plane-crazy 2020-03-24 06:59:48 Otherwise, no
plane-crazy 2020-03-24 06:59:44 Do it if you dont like global warming
plane-crazy 2020-03-24 06:58:54 Welcome to plane crazy, we make things
plane-crazy 2020-03-24 06:57:53 Any year that ends with a 20 is really cursed, isn't it?
plane-crazy 2020-03-24 06:57:24 Like the Spanish flu
plane-crazy 2020-03-24 06:57:13 And that when you realize that the centuries before at the same number has some plagues happened
plane-crazy 2020-03-24 06:55:50 It's not even half of the year yet and tons of things went zero to a hundred real quick
plane-crazy 2020-03-24 06:55:25 And bad stuffs happened
plane-crazy 2020-03-24 06:51:36 That model of the Panzer IV somehow reminds me of PlaneFreak's Panzers
plane-crazy 2020-03-24 05:55:00 Do they fly?
plane-crazy 2020-03-24 05:54:56 Cars are landing in your castle?
plane-crazy 2020-03-24 05:52:59 They have ten legs
plane-crazy 2020-03-24 05:52:54 Ten
plane-crazy 2020-03-24 05:45:20 I dont often see people build buildings in PC
plane-crazy 2020-03-24 05:42:58 <@!322970944303923200>
plane-crazy 2020-03-24 05:42:07 Some tanks are literally land battleships that is taken too literally
plane-crazy 2020-03-24 05:40:06 So im confused
plane-crazy 2020-03-24 05:39:59 I know how to answer, but I cant seem to get the right word for it
plane-crazy 2020-03-24 05:39:27 ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
plane-crazy 2020-03-24 05:36:36 And also design
plane-crazy 2020-03-24 05:36:28 Your legs basically dont allow for effective movement from that stiffness
plane-crazy 2020-03-24 05:36:02 Oh wait
plane-crazy 2020-03-24 05:34:41 Well, try it like that for starters and see if it works
plane-crazy 2020-03-24 05:34:29 |
   |
|
   |
plane-crazy 2020-03-24 05:34:13 Move it like this
plane-crazy 2020-03-24 05:33:57 How else?
plane-crazy 2020-03-24 05:33:54 Uh, motors
plane-crazy 2020-03-24 05:33:28 <@456226577798135808>Change the way those legs move, not by remaking the entire leg itself
plane-crazy 2020-03-24 05:30:06 i mean, how else would you do it? make it go backwards?
plane-crazy 2020-03-24 05:29:51 you make it go forward
plane-crazy 2020-03-24 05:29:48 easy
plane-crazy 2020-03-24 05:29:41 You make it go forward
plane-crazy 2020-03-23 21:47:22 Yes, yes you did
plane-crazy 2020-03-23 21:43:13 Hi stupid, im dad
plane-crazy 2020-03-23 21:43:02 Im not sure whats wrong with it, im probably just too used with light theme
plane-crazy 2020-03-23 21:21:16 That will sure cause nausea
plane-crazy 2020-03-23 21:20:50 Nice theme park ride
plane-crazy 2020-03-23 16:31:03 Not to be mistaken by Chevrolet yes
plane-crazy 2020-03-23 16:30:49 A new car brand
plane-crazy 2020-03-23 06:25:14 <@!180475893112635392> Ah yes, the slowly dying, stale but with a loyal fanbase game called ***[REDACTED]***
plane-crazy 2020-03-07 18:26:10 Though that's harder than the conventional design
plane-crazy 2020-03-07 18:25:46 Or make an oscillating turret
plane-crazy 2020-03-07 18:25:13 That's the problem I noticed
plane-crazy 2020-03-07 18:23:03 
plane-crazy 2020-03-07 18:21:15 Or just make the gun the thing that elevates and depress while the turret being the one that rotates
plane-crazy 2020-03-07 18:20:30 One way to fix your problem is to make an oscillating turret
plane-crazy 2020-03-07 18:18:53 You have a motor underneath the turret that is connected to the hull
plane-crazy 2020-03-07 18:18:32 Oh I see why it doesn't move
plane-crazy 2020-03-07 18:17:55 Like the left one as F and R
The right one as R and F
plane-crazy 2020-03-07 18:17:34 Try changing the keybinds so they're the opposite of each other
plane-crazy 2020-03-07 18:17:05 You don't really need 2 motors for it to turn, but sure
plane-crazy 2020-03-07 18:16:18 Like try making the left one F and R while the right one as R and F
plane-crazy 2020-03-07 18:15:44 And did you make the motor keybinds the opposite to each other?
plane-crazy 2020-03-07 18:15:11 It's the blocks underneath the motor
plane-crazy 2020-02-24 13:10:42 Or the cylinders won't be attached to the motors
plane-crazy 2020-02-24 13:10:30 Because the tail wings wont be attached to the cylinders
plane-crazy 2020-02-24 13:10:01 You mean half cylinders?
plane-crazy 2020-02-24 13:05:09 <@!421975189362966538> That's not the reason why it wouldn't turn
plane-crazy 2020-02-24 12:29:06 It isnt really anything that reaches the level of genius lol
plane-crazy 2020-02-24 12:18:34 Try deleting the blocks shown in green and red and if that still doesnt work, try deleting the ones in orange
plane-crazy 2020-02-24 12:17:47 The half wedge 2 encircled in red apparently made the motor on the rudder attached to the plane, while the half blocks shown in green is still stuck to the tail wing <@!488239293475586048>
plane-crazy 2020-02-24 12:16:35 Basically these circled blocks are the main culprit, though the orange one isn't the main problem to it
plane-crazy 2020-02-24 12:05:43 I had to replicate the problem and managed to fix it by deleting the half blocks next to the wings and motor and the half wedge 2 that was under the 2nd motor
plane-crazy 2020-02-24 12:04:45 Some of parts were still connected but it wasnt visible to the eye
plane-crazy 2020-02-24 12:00:28 I see why it doesnt turn now
plane-crazy 2020-02-24 11:41:24 Im not exactly sure why, since I haven't seen his entire build
plane-crazy 2020-02-24 11:41:05 This person cant seem to make his motor turn
plane-crazy 2020-02-24 11:40:06 Hm, why not try deleting that one specific half block I mentioned?
plane-crazy 2020-02-24 11:39:51 If not, try deleting that one specific blue half block I mentioned earlier
plane-crazy 2020-02-24 11:39:18 If they are, then that's the problem
plane-crazy 2020-02-24 11:39:08 Are they connected?
plane-crazy 2020-02-24 11:38:16 It's those delta wings
plane-crazy 2020-02-24 11:38:09 Ah, I see the problem
plane-crazy 2020-02-24 11:37:04 Try deleting this one specific half block and try turning
plane-crazy 2020-02-24 11:35:56 Not the wings above it
plane-crazy 2020-02-24 11:35:53 What about the blue stuffs next to it?
plane-crazy 2020-02-24 11:35:21 What about this?
plane-crazy 2020-02-24 11:34:39 Are you sure its not connected?
plane-crazy 2020-02-24 11:31:45 Otherwise you'd have a motor that is trying to turn the entire creation
plane-crazy 2020-02-24 11:31:22 You need to make sure that the tail isnt connected to the main creation
plane-crazy 2020-02-24 10:32:28 Ah yes, the airbus species of birds
plane-crazy 2020-02-24 09:55:02 You mean this?
plane-crazy 2020-02-24 09:52:31 Im not well versed in this community, so grant me your wisdom
plane-crazy 2020-02-24 09:51:54 Oh, then what is it?
plane-crazy 2020-02-24 09:48:29 But anyways, thanks for the feedback
plane-crazy 2020-02-24 09:47:03 If you're talking about that, I did fold it when making it since the ship was too long
plane-crazy 2020-02-24 09:46:13 Like this?
plane-crazy 2020-02-24 09:44:10 And I had no idea what pontoons were because I dont live in a country that primarily speaks english
plane-crazy 2020-02-24 09:43:43 It was too long, so I had to make it into 2 sections
plane-crazy 2020-02-24 09:43:34 Oh, I did fold the ship
plane-crazy 2020-02-24 09:42:28 Wdym by fold?
plane-crazy 2020-02-24 09:42:02 The only other ship I made was literally a small PT boat and a submarine
plane-crazy 2020-02-24 09:41:45 Well I am new to shipbuilding lol
plane-crazy 2020-02-24 09:41:32 I'll take note on that
plane-crazy 2020-02-24 09:41:10 Haven't, I did try using heliums so it doesn't fall on its side
plane-crazy 2020-02-24 09:40:28 But it's seriously unstable since it's a long and narrow ship
plane-crazy 2020-02-24 09:40:07 The only big problem I have on the ship isn't the details
plane-crazy 2020-02-24 09:34:24 Im not too committed into this discord to even remember these kind of stuffs
plane-crazy 2020-02-24 09:34:00 Even so, I dont really remember
plane-crazy 2020-02-24 09:33:50 Probably got another rank because of the Me-262 I made a while back
plane-crazy 2020-02-24 09:33:36 The only attempts on a rank I requested was on my microplane
plane-crazy 2020-02-24 09:33:07 I kinda forgot about it
plane-crazy 2020-02-24 09:32:31 Oh, you mean this?
plane-crazy 2020-02-24 09:31:42 And I got the microbuilder rank previously which is gone now
plane-crazy 2020-02-24 09:31:19 I was here before the rank system was revised
plane-crazy 2020-02-24 09:30:49 Me?
plane-crazy 2020-02-24 09:30:46 Who?
plane-crazy 2020-02-24 09:29:59 Those details on the rear should be fine for me to make, the one on the bow is a bit difficult
plane-crazy 2020-02-24 09:29:05 Mk
plane-crazy 2020-02-24 09:29:03 Ah, those
plane-crazy 2020-02-24 09:28:29 I might have to fix the bow so it's a bit more rounder
plane-crazy 2020-02-24 09:27:32 Mk, what details?
plane-crazy 2020-02-24 09:27:24 Should I make the hull and superstructure more darker so it looks like this?
plane-crazy 2020-02-24 09:26:50 Mk
plane-crazy 2020-02-24 09:26:06 or the red paint on the hull?
plane-crazy 2020-02-24 09:25:55 The deck?
plane-crazy 2020-02-24 09:25:12 Here's the real ship
plane-crazy 2020-02-24 09:25:06 Yes
plane-crazy 2020-02-24 09:24:51 here's another angle
plane-crazy 2020-02-24 09:24:34 My first time making a ship this large, so idk what I need to fix
plane-crazy 2020-02-24 09:24:12 kk
plane-crazy 2020-02-24 09:23:48 i demand feedback on how i should paint it, and what needs to be fixed
plane-crazy 2020-02-24 09:23:34 a destroyer to be specific
plane-crazy 2020-02-24 09:23:31 a ship
plane-crazy 2020-02-24 09:21:50 i demand feedback on something
plane-crazy 2020-02-23 00:13:56 What should I improve on this?
plane-crazy 2020-02-23 00:05:35 Wait what? 201 blocks in length?
plane-crazy 2020-02-22 14:15:51 <@414778672847781888> Can I see how your gun looks?
plane-crazy 2020-02-22 13:49:03 I kinda prefer them to be small
plane-crazy 2020-02-22 13:48:48 <@456226577798135808> I don't like building large builds
plane-crazy 2020-02-22 13:47:29 I demand that ship to have more dazzle camo
plane-crazy 2020-02-22 13:46:47 <@414778672847781888> sure
plane-crazy 2020-02-22 13:45:40 I might be wrong though
plane-crazy 2020-02-22 13:45:11 I think I started playing somewhere in late 2018
plane-crazy 2020-02-22 13:44:10 Who?
plane-crazy 2020-02-22 13:43:48 Eh, its not as detailed as I wanted it to be
plane-crazy 2020-02-22 13:43:25 Oof
plane-crazy 2020-02-22 13:43:23 I question my decision to create this ship, its a lot larger in brick counts than my previous builds
plane-crazy 2020-02-22 13:41:58 Wouldn't this do? Its literally the pic of my shimakaze and you don't need to scroll far up <@456226577798135808>
plane-crazy 2020-02-22 13:40:39 <@456226577798135808> Hold on
plane-crazy 2020-02-22 13:40:18 I do plan to make the hull higher because it keeps listing
plane-crazy 2020-02-22 13:39:29 <@456226577798135808> And yes, it is the Shimakaze
plane-crazy 2020-02-22 13:39:08 <@385411356708569090> The bridge or the hull?
plane-crazy 2020-02-22 13:36:08 And elaborate on making it more realistic? <@!385411356708569090>
plane-crazy 2020-02-22 13:35:18 So far, this is the amount I have finished
plane-crazy 2020-02-22 13:34:18 It's half finished
plane-crazy 2020-02-22 13:33:21 Anyways, is there anything that needs to be fixed on my ship?
plane-crazy 2020-02-22 13:32:38 lol
plane-crazy 2020-02-22 13:32:00 Not sure if I should post it here or in creations, but I'd like some feedback on what I should fix on this ship
plane-crazy 2019-07-24 08:26:09 <@!322970944303923200> I dont see a leo?
plane-crazy 2019-07-24 08:22:45 ***hmmm***
plane-crazy 2019-07-22 11:28:50 <@456226577798135808> Should I paint it all grey?
plane-crazy 2019-07-22 11:08:20 Im fine with anything
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 14:24:06 Jagd T-34
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 13:53:36 I tried making a bi-plane of my Me-262 plane. Fun fact, it doesnt work
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 13:51:38 👏
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 13:46:59 Its also hard to find good roleplayers
