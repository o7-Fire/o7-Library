creations-chat 2019-07-21 11:33:55 A pretty much unpainted Me-262 (Not sure how to paint it), it goes about 470 SPS with 229 total brick count.

I had to figure out how to get around the problem of the plane being front heavy, about the engine not having any room for a closed top, and that I cant seem to put the elevators on the rudder
creations-chat 2019-07-21 13:36:31 <@210141202698338304> Its not finished yet, but im taking suggestions
creations-chat 2019-07-21 13:38:17 <@210141202698338304> Some guy suggested me to add that propellers so it looks like a jet engine
creations-chat 2019-07-21 13:38:38 I did that
creations-chat 2019-07-21 13:38:45 It looks pretty weird
creations-chat 2019-07-21 13:39:37 I think I have a pic of it when it had actual jet engines
creations-chat 2019-07-21 13:40:53 This was when it had actual jet engines <@210141202698338304>
creations-chat 2019-07-21 13:41:35 Oh that
creations-chat 2019-07-21 13:41:48 I think I might be able to do that
creations-chat 2019-07-21 13:42:52 Might be hard though
creations-chat 2019-07-21 13:43:08 Since something needs to carry all that weight
creations-chat 2019-07-21 13:43:42 <@456226577798135808> I have no idea
creations-chat 2019-07-21 13:44:25 <@456226577798135808> I do

creations-chat 2020-02-23 00:36:51 Polar Express 2
creations-chat 2020-02-23 12:43:21 Reminds me a lot of the Leopard 2A4's Revolution upgrade
creations-chat 2020-02-27 16:22:03 That happens
creations-chat 2020-02-27 16:28:43 Very nice
creations-chat 2020-02-27 16:28:51 Now make the gravity gun
creations-chat 2020-02-27 16:31:11 Can it elevate with each wheel?
creations-chat 2020-02-27 16:31:38 I use the magnet for movement for a non-engine aircraft <@456226577798135808>
creations-chat 2020-02-27 16:31:54 Its laggy and I dont know if it even works again
creations-chat 2020-02-27 16:32:50 Compared to the other forms of engines I've used, the magnet engine is more efficient and accelerates seriously fast
creations-chat 2020-02-27 16:33:42 Like you can get up to your top speed in just 1-2 seconds with a magnet
creations-chat 2020-02-27 16:36:27 <@456226577798135808> I wonder if its possible to create levitating obbies with those levitation device you made
creations-chat 2020-02-27 16:38:28 Hmm, he didnt make it despite being on his plot
creations-chat 2020-02-27 16:38:37 <:Thonk:509498568982134816>
creations-chat 2020-02-27 16:39:50 How about a hover train or something?
creations-chat 2020-02-27 16:42:44 Yeah, it'll probably be useful for like simulating space
creations-chat 2020-02-27 16:43:54 No, like space
creations-chat 2020-02-27 16:44:07 You never heard what outer space is?
creations-chat 2020-02-27 16:44:18 The place where stuffs like rocks float?

creations-chat 2020-03-06 06:05:21 I like the cockpit design
creations-chat 2020-03-06 06:06:39 My only problem with it is the nose design, but eh
creations-chat 2020-03-06 06:06:45 I can't be too picky
creations-chat 2020-03-06 06:13:46 You gave me an idea, thanks

creations-chat 2020-03-07 17:41:45 That reminds me of the caterpillar tracks the British mark iv tanks
creations-chat 2020-03-07 17:42:42 What about the body?
creations-chat 2020-03-07 17:43:33 No, I mean like does the body move like a shark swimming?
creations-chat 2020-03-07 17:43:53 Like zig zagging or some sort
creations-chat 2020-03-07 17:47:25 Fairly stiff, but nice
creations-chat 2020-03-07 17:47:50 The only problem I have with the build is the tail design
creations-chat 2020-03-07 17:56:44 Tbh, it gives me those arcade tank game vibes
creations-chat 2020-03-07 18:04:59 If you remove the turret, it become the Goliath

creations-chat 2020-03-22 17:53:46 <@531903658011394058> Not always
creations-chat 2020-03-22 17:54:34 A bit late, but there are reasons why there are actual military aircraft that uses backward wings
creations-chat 2020-03-22 17:59:36 They basically have their own advantages that makes countries like the US spend money on such aircraft
creations-chat 2020-03-22 18:09:30 Visually smooth, I like it
creations-chat 2020-03-23 07:03:11 downvoted, there's no eggs inside

creations-chat 2020-03-23 07:47:56 <@456226577798135808> add an egg into the van's trunk
creations-chat 2020-03-23 07:47:58 or no
creations-chat 2020-03-23 07:48:18 if it's an egg van, it must have an egg inside

the-dump 2020-03-24 10:28:43 Oh no
the-dump 2020-03-27 10:30:34 no, it doesnt break any rules
the-dump 2020-03-27 10:32:18 It's also not discussing anything controversial
the-dump 2020-03-27 10:32:47 It's simply an ironic meme from those ridiculous "ethnicity estimate" websites
creations-chat 2020-04-17 11:04:48 <@!471659414575775794> No offense, but that looks nothing like a Panzer IV
creations-chat 2020-04-17 11:06:30 It looks more like a TOG 2 with a sloped front
