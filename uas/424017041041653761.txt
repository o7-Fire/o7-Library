creations-chat 2021-09-09 18:07:15 The intake is the same, wedge and half wedge down on top the nose is also the same with a pyramid wedge and 2 half wedges 1x2
creations-chat 2021-09-09 18:22:30 it looks the same as vulpen’s f15 with more stabilizers
creations-chat 2021-09-09 18:24:32 If you want to prove that it isn’t a tutorial post a close up picture of the plane
creations-chat 2021-09-09 18:39:48 The full plane not the tail fins, that doesn’t prove it isn’t a tutorial
creations-chat 2021-09-09 18:43:47 It isn’t based, its the tutorial with different tail fins
creations-chat 2021-09-09 18:46:03 He is helping his friend and trying to convince us it isn’t a tut lmao
creations-chat 2021-09-09 18:49:08 Painfully obvious even with low res screenshot
