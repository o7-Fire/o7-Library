The Tale of CubingTurtle (453930002430296065)
help 2021-06-04 05:08:55 hey everyone, the jet i built seems to really like to wobble when coming out of turns, sometimes uncontrollably just going straight too. ive googled around and apparently helium is a good fix? i put it in the nose but it doesn't seem to do much. Gosjo64 on youtube also says put control pads in the nose, also doesn't seem to help that much. any suggestions?

help 2021-06-08 01:33:00 vertical stabilizers a little too tall, shorten em a bit and the proportions will match. Also lots of weird trapdoors and other little things around that seem a bit unneccessary but thats just me
creations-chat 2021-06-08 03:34:01 i upvoted but i think the proportions are just too off for some people, the wing is too large for such a tiny body
creations-chat 2021-06-08 03:43:43 then it ugly
