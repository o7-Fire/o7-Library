plane-crazy 2020-07-20 20:19:19 Ok I already understood that the roblox removed the lines, but why do the creators of plane crazy not put it again?
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 20:18:46 even if I paint or put a texture on the side that doesn’t shine in some buildings I can’t see anything it’s all dark I can’t
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 20:17:51 they’ve done something worse like practically every block in the game physics things are more difficult than putting lines in blocks
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 20:17:27 it's just they put it again
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 20:17:08 but why not put the lines again? it was much better with the lines what sense?
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 20:15:50 Hey, when are you going to put the lines on the blocks again? because it’s very difficult to build the parts that don’t get sun are dark and almost impossible to make
