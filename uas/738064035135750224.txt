help 2021-07-28 06:07:11 If it‚Äôs a blimp make sure it is rounded and not rigid
help 2021-07-28 06:07:17 Otherwise it would be a zeppelin
help 2021-07-28 06:07:50 In my opinion, zeppelins are more expendable than blimps, but you can build what you want

help 2021-09-20 02:24:25 Has someone fixed this problem yet
help 2021-09-20 02:25:24 If it still spins, it may be the direction one of the rotors is spinning; are your rotors jet powered or motor powered?
help 2021-09-20 02:25:54 If it still spins try flipping the direction of the jets
help 2021-09-20 02:26:40 Try both rotors until the only force being applied is upward and it stops spinning, depending on weight distribution it may go forward or backward but you can add helium and control panels until it levels out to your according preferences

creations-chat 2021-09-20 22:34:45 I usually go for messy apocalyptic looks on most of my militaristic builds, so u might expect alot of detail or "mess"

creations-chat 2021-10-04 20:17:13 Thanks, I thought it would look nicer without the sails because ive seen some really incredible french ships that did not have sails, I will most likely add some in the future though
creations-chat 2021-10-04 20:24:03 oooo I love to weather my builds
creations-chat 2021-10-04 20:26:24 I don't usually make realistic planes, when I do of course they are clean, but I usually make sci fi jets and random cool crap that comes to my head.
creations-chat 2021-10-04 20:29:00 Also thank you to everyone who upvoted my Atomica Epilogue from a couple of days ago, I got over 110 upvotes; that jet is also the reason I got my expert designer rank level V

creations-chat 2021-10-13 03:24:51 I agree, also hi everyone
creations-chat 2021-10-13 03:27:34 Oh you should piston lock that part
creations-chat 2021-10-13 03:29:35 In my opinion, the night photos were a bit unnecessary, no diss to the build just a friendly tip <@778133713912856586>
creations-chat 2021-10-13 03:32:35 All we‚Äôre saying is you could‚Äôve put a litttle more detail into it, no diss or anything just a little more effort would‚Äôve went a long way
creations-chat 2021-10-13 03:35:40 Did you put any motor locking in your micro build <@778133713912856586>
creations-chat 2021-10-13 03:38:29 Not bad
creations-chat 2021-10-13 03:40:31 You should motor lock some cylinders into the nozzle or add some caging to the cockpit windshield so the gun looks more natural
creations-chat 2021-10-13 03:42:50 Thanks
creations-chat 2021-10-13 03:49:46 Bro you still could‚Äôve put more effort into it tho

creations-chat 2021-10-13 16:30:13 I wonder why so many people here build like mostly realistic vehicles and no sci fi or fantasy themed builds
creations-chat 2021-10-13 16:32:38 true

creations-chat 2021-10-14 21:52:17 What is up boys hru today

creations-chat 2021-10-15 18:35:55 That is really cool
creations-chat 2021-10-15 18:46:09 No
creations-chat 2021-10-16 01:14:00 <@!894564166256427038> theres no motor locking; its just a wheel in a shaft
creations-chat 2021-10-16 01:24:36 ohh
creations-chat 2021-10-17 19:36:42 <@!869613092559007774> if dababy was in terraria
creations-chat 2021-10-20 23:22:18 <@!724699963531198586> that blimp is sick, btw if it has a rigid frame it is actually considered a zeppelin tho (just a common misconception)
creations-chat 2021-10-20 23:24:44 I am also making a zeppelin currently, I‚Äôm a huge fallout fan as well
creations-chat 2021-10-20 23:52:21 You mean copying?
creations-chat 2021-10-22 13:01:55 Ofc
creations-chat 2021-10-22 13:03:57 I think the red should definitely be a little duller, when colors are too bright like that they usually signify like a cartoony look; I usually make brighter colors on my builds a little duller so they don‚Äôt look like cartoons
creations-chat 2021-10-22 13:06:06 F o n e  b u k <:FineTroll:626841259746656289>
creations-chat 2021-10-22 13:20:55 yeah
creations-chat 2021-10-22 13:30:44 looks good, I recommend dulling the red a little more so it doesnt stick out so much
creations-chat 2021-10-22 13:33:52 just the red tab, whats the current code for the tabs?
creations-chat 2021-10-22 13:41:27 Yeah that looks a lot better
creations-chat 2021-10-22 13:50:33 looks good
creations-chat 2021-10-22 14:03:08 probably not

creations-chat 2021-10-24 02:49:17 Reply to <@456226577798135808>  thanks for tips.  <@!527653676022628353> its not floating its connected to the front of the car. Its not floating even though it may look like its floating, I assure you it is connected to the car and not floating :)) <@!526780837300142081> I should do some more painting and texturing tru
creations-chat 2021-10-24 02:52:45 Theres no need for insults, Mira mijito si sigue con eso <@!527653676022628353> soy de la republico dominicana mijito lo hablo espanol

creations-chat 2021-10-24 03:29:33 Motorlock gore? <@!707953054489509978>
creations-chat 2021-10-24 03:32:38 What gore lol; last time I checked post apocalyptic military grade aircraft wasn't THAT gruesome, unless your playing fallout
creations-chat 2021-10-24 05:19:29 It‚Äôs all detail but it might look like a mess from far away
creations-chat 2021-10-24 05:21:36 Not true, not every ‚Äúgood‚Äù build is gonna be smooth, it‚Äôs supposed to be messy and heavy because it‚Äôs an apocalyptic themed militaristic jet, carrying an unrealistically large load. 

Bro what statistics üíÄ I already told you this isn‚Äôt a ‚Äúrealistic‚Äù plane, not every good aircraft is gonna be an F22 lol
creations-chat 2021-10-24 05:25:07 Bro crude what üíÄ it already looks themed enough, if I have to explain to you that it‚Äôs an apocalyptic aircraft you‚Äôre contradicting yourself tho 

I mean you can look at it how you want man, I‚Äôm not gonna change how I make my aircrafts just because one kid thinks it looks ‚Äúmessy‚Äù <@!707953054489509978>
creations-chat 2021-10-24 05:29:10 It‚Äôs not slow though, it would most likely classify as a vtol
creations-chat 2021-10-24 05:35:42 Bro why are you consistently pointing out details of my builds when you‚Äôre contradicting yourself, corrugated panels is meant to be part of that post apocalyptic look; any details like what you see as ‚Äúuneven‚Äù color is part of the build, no aspect of the plane was left aside or not considered. If you need any further explanation to why certain aspects of the aircraft are the way they are you can ask. Maybe you are used to only realistic builds but I think you shouldnt limit your field of view to only realistic aircrafts. 
I mean u can look at it how you want but I‚Äôm not gonna change how I make my aircrafts just because one kid thinks it looks ‚Äúmessy‚Äù <@!707953054489509978>
creations-chat 2021-10-24 05:39:20 <@287454032250011649> I never made any grammar mistakes, also I don‚Äôt really care if you downvote on a build that‚Äôs like a month old and has over 110 upvotes LMAO

Well if that‚Äôs how you want to use your judgement then okay lol; everyone sees what they want to see <@!707953054489509978>
creations-chat 2021-10-24 05:43:59 You‚Äôre right, I listen to rap. Also have fun scrolling up to the post lmao

Then whyd I what <@456226577798135808>

creations-chat 2021-10-24 05:54:26 Then why‚Äôd I what
creations-chat 2021-10-24 05:56:30 No he just changed his name and changed his pfp 

That was a long time ago, not sure why u brought it up I already talked to some people about it in <#478584971670454284> like 3 weeks ago and I told them that it was just a prank my friend was pulling <@!521504905693888521>

Yeah <@!521504905693888521> he changed it back to regular a long time ago as well
creations-chat 2021-10-24 06:00:25 Why‚Äôd I say what‚Ä¶

<@!521504905693888521> doesn‚Äôt say when he mentioned?? If it means a lot to u you could ask him yourself when he did the prank

I can‚Äôt really explain that then idk <@!521504905693888521> if you still have doubt or smthn then you can dm Fishy tmrw if u want
creations-chat 2021-10-24 06:05:13 <@!796708501816213524> nice job on your phantom btw
creations-chat 2021-10-24 06:07:26 The colors are fine it just needs different shades of that beige <@!796708501816213524>, consider adding more texture as well, what was your reference?

Ah I see, do you need help with any color codes? <@!796708501816213524>
creations-chat 2021-10-24 06:16:40 I think you should do a sand gradient for patches of lighter shaded beige, the sand texture will give it a smoother camo look
creations-chat 2021-10-24 06:21:21 I agree with Sleed; you should try to extrude the nose a little further

<@!811909229588906006> that plane is really cool, nice job

creations-chat 2021-10-24 06:29:21 Yes but make the cockpit windshield angle locked so it isn‚Äôt the exact same angle as the nose of the plane
creations-chat 2021-10-24 13:49:51 The cockpit windshield is slightly angled upward, sorry for late response I went to bed lol

creations-chat 2021-10-24 14:52:24 Yeah
creations-chat 2021-10-24 14:54:30 Really? You shouldn't take stuff like that from people if their intent isn't to help u get better at the game.   <@!707953054489509978> If that was our intent we should tell him HOW he can do better not point out all the little things he did wrong.
creations-chat 2021-10-24 14:57:11 Alr if youre okay with that kind of criticism, but I am pretty sure I'm the only person on this server that wont freaking harass someone when their build is ass lmao

<@456226577798135808> Good effort but I have a few suggestions, try to give some depth to the intake by taking out those inner blocks; try rounding the edges a bit too, you don‚Äôt want to have blocky details
creations-chat 2021-11-25 22:22:07 Sorry to disagree with you, although the intakes aren‚Äôt like super defined, they still aren‚Äôt like flat yk, I would recommend motor locking some ladder blocks into the intake and angle locking some blocks to make the intake outer a bit more curved. Just a suggestion :))

creations-chat 2021-11-30 04:31:52 No, rigid airships (framed ships like zeppelins) are not balloons <:FineTroll:626841259746656289> it‚Äôs a common misconception tho.   <@595298908574449688> I guess that qualifies
creations-chat 2021-11-30 04:39:32 <@!401530469952389130> <@287454032250011649> I meant like how they aren‚Äôt bent and there is much more space between the body and the intakes, I feel like they could be a little more bent or maybe it‚Äôs just me
creations-chat 2021-11-30 04:41:37 <@!401530469952389130> Bro chill I made a mistake, you guys are merciless lmao.     <@287454032250011649> Great job it‚Äôs perfect
creations-chat 2021-11-30 04:44:09 Bruh I made a mistake can you chill please we‚Äôre all good here, I was just saying you did a good job man.  <@!401530469952389130> Sorry I made a mistake, in the photo it looked a bit more bent
creations-chat 2021-11-30 04:46:55 So there‚Äôs this thing called not looking at an image close enough‚Ä¶ also no need to speak in all caps üíÄ
creations-chat 2021-11-30 04:49:19 I mixed it up yeah, my bad 

<@!401530469952389130> I already told you, I perceived the intake as slightly bent inward before getting a closer look; I think you need to take an anger management session- I just answered you‚Ä¶
creations-chat 2021-11-30 04:52:55 I don‚Äôt understand why every conversation in this channel has to end up in some blown up argument over hot headed 13 year olds like DoubleWide.   Bro I already answered your question can you scroll up üíÄ     <@!441939688018935818> that‚Äôs true
creations-chat 2021-11-30 04:55:01 I agree lmao, civil conversation is a m y t h

<@!401530469952389130> ok so inward toward the only other thing that exists üí°

creations-chat 2021-11-30 05:03:16 Bro‚Ä¶ anyone reading this can you scroll up and find any part of this conversation when I was ‚Äúangry‚Äù üíÄ you‚Äôre the one who spoke in all caps my guy I was just trying to mediate
creations-chat 2021-11-30 05:06:23 You just seem like you‚Äôre trying to sound smart bruh

creations-chat 2021-11-30 05:09:12 Broooo i‚Äôm done üíÄ I can‚Äôt put up with 13 year olds like this

<@!799381636407099483> please try and get this man to just comprehend what I‚Äôm trying to tell him
creations-chat 2021-11-30 05:12:21 1st off, I am talking to him, 2nd of all, if I‚Äôm supposedly the one who is ‚Äúkeeping this argument up‚Äù then I am going to end it by bringing an admin into this if that‚Äôs what you want.

<@!723940197456281640> I did explain multiple times, this person is just acting critical and it‚Äôs messed up. You should read the entire chat before making assumptions
creations-chat 2021-11-30 05:14:49 I‚Äôm done, if I‚Äôm supposedly keeping this argument up then i am not going to continue. No more arguing. <@!335599526414909451> please try to mediate this whenever is convenient for you. 

<@!540515443132334090> Thank you, I meant the other way tho so the open space is towards the front of the plane

<@!401530469952389130> yes or no to what??
creations-chat 2021-11-30 05:17:55 It‚Äôs a messed up community sometimes 

<@!401530469952389130> bro can you shut up the discussion is over
creations-chat 2021-11-30 05:21:33 Motor lock on a light set of motor 2s like that might cause it to shake; if that ends up happening, I would recommend going for a sort of minimalistic design like covering the outermost segments. Another option is making more turrets and spreading the gun blocks
creations-chat 2021-11-30 05:25:17 I think the minimalist color choice is a nice detail, also the sail is pretty good
creations-chat 2021-11-30 05:27:36 Not bad, I think I would‚Äôve placed the pilot seat a little more to the side or back a bit
help 2021-11-30 05:29:25 Do i need a special perm to leave suggestions? I noticed the channels chats were locked
creations-chat 2021-11-30 05:30:04 Okay but what would you rather have me say? ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre build is shit XD‚Äù I don‚Äôt think you can compare someone who is still learning how to get better at the game to like a professional yk
creations-chat 2021-11-30 05:32:14 Yea, I upvoted your tank <@!765318482753224704>; only suggestions I would give is a little more texture variation and also some work on that turret, but for now it looks pretty good. Good job üëç
help 2021-11-30 05:33:28 Okay thanks, I didn‚Äôt see that previously sorry
help 2021-11-30 05:33:30 Thanks for the help
creations-chat 2021-11-30 05:39:15 Try to think of it this way, upvoting doesn‚Äôt necessarily or always mean that you would build that creation yourself, it just means that you support the builder as they advance; not all builders build the same
creations-chat 2021-11-30 05:43:19 Not necessarily, obviously unless you scrolled and scrolled and scrolled you wouldn‚Äôt be able to upvote every build that people post, but it‚Äôs good to show that you still support their efforts yk, (I don‚Äôt mean upvoting something that obviously is not a build with much effort put into it) 

<@!707953054489509978> we‚Äôre chill, nothing is an argument unless you make it an argument yk
creations-chat 2021-11-30 22:41:19 What'd u guys think about my heli     <@!733276175862071316> Its apocalyptic üíÄ that's all I can say, apocalyptic engineers put together whatever they find man, and it almost always looks badass
creations-chat 2021-11-30 22:44:13 No it shouldn't- Its apocalyptic... its not supposed to be realistic
creations-chat 2021-11-30 22:46:15 Not necessarily, anything apocalyptic combines wasteland scrap and functionality- not to mention cheeto dust stains.   Its supposed to combine the strength of an MI-8 with the faster flight capability of an Osprey
creations-chat 2021-11-30 22:50:36 The lore I've put behind this build would be a broken MI-8 found in a musty jungle river, combined with the remains of an old osprey with its own technological advancements; in apocalypse you really can't be picky with what warfare aircraft you choose to fly/build

creations-chat 2021-11-30 22:55:57 Bro the plane crazy community is only used to realistic builds lmao, I get freaking harassed every time I post an apocalyptic build and have to explain the concept of apocalypse     <@!733276175862071316> Not u im just saying like before and in general, people have always been skeptical of apocalyptic builds   <@456226577798135808> Thx      <@!527653676022628353> I deleted it on purpose lol, a few minutes ago i posted the same thing and deleted it because I brought up how people would harass me for my apocalyptic builds. I can re upload it if you want
creations-chat 2021-11-30 23:08:06 Bro üíÄ what do you think looks apocalyptic; a new F22 with a coca cola stain on the windshield :))
creations-chat 2021-11-30 23:10:23 Lmao have you guys ever played any fallout game? Apocalyptic aircraft is supposed to look experimental
creations-chat 2021-11-30 23:13:15 Yeah I am going to remake the one I built, I built that one a hell long ago but I wanted to see what people thought, I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôve ever made one of those either though so you shouldn‚Äôt be a hypocrite
creations-chat 2021-11-30 23:15:58 Bro üíÄ. Are you blind

Bruh you sound like a 13 year old what the hell is speaking out of my ass

<@!527653676022628353> I don‚Äôt need to talk to ignorant  haters like u bruh lmao
creations-chat 2021-11-30 23:23:22 You‚Äôre too ignorant to know how  the key word,  **apocalypse** relates to fallout <@!527653676022628353> and for some reason you immediately thought vertibird

<@!765318482753224704> I appreciate it, but please don‚Äôt hold me up too high or else these other people are gonna get pissed off

<@!527653676022628353> no they‚Äôre about the same as when we started talking üòê you‚Äôre still ignorant
creations-chat 2021-11-30 23:26:15 When you don‚Äôt understand the concept of apocalyptic aircraft

creations-chat 2021-12-04 01:10:43 Ah yes makes sense
creations-chat 2021-12-04 01:14:42 Front part is good. Also, you think an emo duck is hot?...
creations-chat 2021-12-04 01:16:56 She's emo bruh  <@!705533053740777584> That's an emo cut
creations-chat 2021-12-04 01:19:20 Bruh emo duck, also if I remember correctly from what I've seen of the show a few years ago, wasn't her mom like satan or something. There were some really graphic scenes for a show made for kids
creations-chat 2021-12-04 01:21:57 Its an emo duck... whose mom is a demon... that would be a pretty awkward "meet the parents" dinner    I didn't notice that
creations-chat 2021-12-04 20:20:05 <@431881268775616513>  It looks like you tried copying doublewidesurprise‚Äôs vehicle design, like with the text signs on the front of the car, and the wheels
creations-chat 2021-12-04 20:22:15 I think your kitchen design looks nice for a minimalist design, you could definitely add a lot more though
creations-chat 2021-12-04 20:25:12 <@431881268775616513> I believe you but I just think you should try to make it a bit different though so people don‚Äôt accuse you

<@431881268775616513> Spice it up with different emojis and color codes, also change the design of the front instead of using the same one that DoubleWide used. You could make it more bubbly

<@!678986403153182772> Ooo nice!
creations-chat 2021-12-04 20:27:13 <@!426156778007429140> Yes

<@!690727914521493504> No, I would reccomend motor locking wedges into the front glass to make the transition cleaner. The transition between the glass and the body is pretty bad
creations-chat 2021-12-04 20:29:39 The tail is ok i guess, you don‚Äôt need to quit it just renovate it. If you quit that easily on projects you‚Äôll never make anything good; I have had old projects that I have lost faith in in the past but I renovated them and I like them more now
creations-chat 2021-12-04 20:32:19 You need to have transitions between most colors, especially under and around the eyes and facial features. Make a darker gradient of the color and mix it with what you‚Äôre blending into
creations-chat 2021-12-04 20:34:21 Ofc
creations-chat 2021-12-04 21:04:49 Looks cool, I would add a bit more color to the bed spread tho

creations-chat 2021-12-12 02:36:24 Maybe they will choose more? or do you think that they choose only at the end   Actually yeah I think you're right; It wouldn't make sense for them to choose early

creations-chat 2021-12-12 02:40:45 Ill finish my build and see if I can get it in before midnight; hopefully I will be considered. What did you all make?

events-chat 2022-01-30 17:55:28 Hey for those of you who don‚Äôt know, evasive action means the plane maneuvering in methods of dodging/**evading** fire or harm. This could include but not limited to flying to higher altitudes to reduce fire and enemies on tail and any flight maneuver purposed in the evasion of enemy harm
<#621452102618578964>
events-chat 2022-01-30 17:55:59 Yes
events-chat 2022-01-30 17:56:32 I don‚Äôt think the plane is allowed to change altitude either
events-chat 2022-01-30 17:56:48 Unless they are like flying over a ridge or something
events-chat 2022-01-30 20:40:59 <@!466793357318815744> Hello, I wanted to ask if winning teams will be determined or if singular player winners will be determined
events-chat 2022-01-30 20:42:01 Yeah it‚Äôs because your back horizontal wings aren‚Äôt horizontal with your front wings, to fix this you can either A. Put bent wings on the front or B. Stabilize that back wings
events-chat 2022-01-30 20:43:22 No they don‚Äôt make super rockets that big in plane crazy
events-chat 2022-01-30 20:43:50 Those aren‚Äôt super rockets
events-chat 2022-01-30 20:44:16 Oh my bad you‚Äôre right I didn‚Äôt see that
events-chat 2022-01-30 20:44:33 I apologize
events-chat 2022-01-30 20:45:04 Lmao true
events-chat 2022-01-30 20:45:46 Yes
events-chat 2022-01-30 20:46:23 Yk I try to make my jets mostly non-control-panel reliant because it means I can lose more of my aircraft and still function
events-chat 2022-01-30 20:47:51 Yeah the more singular panels the harder to destroy
events-chat 2022-01-30 20:48:34 Another reason I try to not be control panel reliant is because you can control your turning much more efficiently than a panel
events-chat 2022-01-30 20:49:00 I still have air brakes on my non control panel reliant jet but they are more or less for pitch
events-chat 2022-01-30 20:52:03 How do people make huge tutorial videos
events-chat 2022-01-30 20:52:30 Like on huge builds
events-chat 2022-01-30 20:52:53 True but they have to memorize every block
events-chat 2022-01-30 20:53:43 Probably
events-chat 2022-01-30 20:54:17 Nice afterburner effect tho
events-chat 2022-01-30 20:55:16 I think I‚Äôm going to remake my ‚ÄúEpilogue‚Äù jet and 1. Make it cleaner looking but still have that apocalyptic look, 2. A little larger, 3. Not glitch like heck when it is idle on the ground
events-chat 2022-01-30 20:55:38 I want a jet that I can land like an actual plane and not worry about it bouncing around like a rubber ball
events-chat 2022-01-30 20:55:57 My jet lands pretty cool but not really how I want it to, it lands like a futuristic space ship
events-chat 2022-01-30 20:56:22 I have a Lancaster but it‚Äôs more of a cartoony design
events-chat 2022-01-30 20:56:40 I was talking about my custom jet
events-chat 2022-01-30 20:57:04 Have u played bomber crew? I was trying to make the Lancaster similar to that kind of design
events-chat 2022-01-30 20:57:46 Oh I meant like how space ships would hover for a sec and then like slowly descend
events-chat 2022-01-30 20:58:07 Basically an apocalyptic harrier
events-chat 2022-01-30 20:58:23 But not really because they look nothing alike, only the landing
events-chat 2022-01-30 20:58:50 You will see me posting a lot of apocalyptic builds in creations, that‚Äôs sort of my thing
events-chat 2022-01-30 21:00:19 People in creations feedback are like, ‚Äúyour creations are so messy and don‚Äôt look anything apocalyptic >:(‚Äú
events-chat 2022-01-30 21:00:39 And I ask them, ‚ÄúWould apocalyptic be to you, an F16 with a coffee stain?‚Äù And they said ‚Äúyes‚Äù
events-chat 2022-01-30 21:01:19 Doesn‚Äôt have to be multiple wings tho
events-chat 2022-01-30 21:01:39 Yes I agree with u :))
events-chat 2022-01-30 21:01:55 Flying nuke be like
events-chat 2022-01-30 21:02:27 True
events-chat 2022-01-30 21:02:44 Everybody always builds like freaking F16s and realistic stuff and I‚Äôm like:

events-chat 2022-01-30 21:03:25 when someone builds an F16 and posts in creations
events-chat 2022-01-30 21:11:30 If it‚Äôs not allowed they simply won‚Äôt choose that creation
events-chat 2022-01-30 21:11:51 Like in the mech competition there were people who didn‚Äôt follow guidelines, they weren‚Äôt chosen for the competition

creations-chat 2022-01-31 02:37:49 If you read the description, you would discover that it is a car **version** of my custom **ship**

creations-chat 2022-01-31 04:51:57 I have such a great idea for Lego theme, What themes have you guys looked into?

<@!790634040780390440> U mean Emmet from Lego movie?
creations-chat 2022-01-31 04:54:50 I see u I see u, I‚Äôm really into the early early age Lego sets since my brother is from the 90s and he is like a Lego fanatic; he introduced me to a lot of the older sets and themes, especially the original Star Wars theme sets
creations-chat 2022-01-31 04:57:06 I wish they would bring back set themes from early 2000s but like reboot them so they fit with the times
creations-chat 2022-01-31 04:59:08 BRO SAME POWER MINERS WAS ABSOLUTE FIRE
creations-chat 2022-01-31 05:02:16 I liked the steampunk vibe
creations-chat 2022-01-31 05:04:25 If you remember what ‚ÄúAdventures of Clutch Powers‚Äù is, you are an absolute goat bro, me and my brother used to watch that all the freaking time back when we were younger

<@!401530469952389130> Yeah I have the DVD somewhere too, I remember watching that so much when I was little
creations-chat 2022-01-31 05:07:19 Yessir- u are a goat if u have it, it‚Äôs absolute fire
creations-chat 2022-01-31 05:09:25 Oh fr? Cane out when I was 3 too

<@!734608228192616572> Fire
creations-chat 2022-01-31 05:11:35 Wow I‚Äôve just been thinking of like how much of a jump in quality Lego movies have gone from Lego Clutch Powers and in just four (my bad)  years to the Lego movie
creations-chat 2022-01-31 05:16:17 What I was gonna say was how I remember blasting üé∂ I I I. I WORK ALONE üé∂ through my house 

<@!401530469952389130> Nah I don‚Äôt remember those but I definitely remember seeing those around; we‚Äôre those newer than the original hero factory figures?
creations-chat 2022-01-31 05:18:35 OOHHH I KNOW WHAT YOURE TALKING ABOUT- THEY MADE ONE OF THOSE SETS LIKE WITH A HUGE FREAKING ALIEN TRAIN THING RIGHT?
creations-chat 2022-01-31 05:21:46 Aw rip, that‚Äôs happened to me a few times before
creations-chat 2022-01-31 05:26:30 
creations-chat 2022-01-31 05:36:05 I have all of those except for the farmer dude, gollum, warrior lady, gorilla, the bounty hunter, and those 2 military camo trooper helmets <@!401530469952389130>
creations-chat 2022-01-31 05:38:55 Imagine if it‚Äôs flat
events-chat 2022-01-31 14:23:13 <@!310238229666201602> doesn‚Äôt look like an atomic bomb to me
creations-chat 2022-01-31 14:44:59 <@456226577798135808> Thank you for that insane amount of nostalgia
creations-chat 2022-01-31 14:49:39 My Lego creation is going to be one that only the OG Lego fanatics are gonna remember
events-chat 2022-01-31 14:51:00 Ah I see

events-chat 2022-01-31 14:53:51 Me?
events-chat 2022-01-31 14:54:14 Oh sorry
events-chat 2022-01-31 14:54:36 Lmao
events-chat 2022-01-31 14:58:03 Sorry that‚Äôs confidential for rn, people born in like late 90s to early 2000s will know what it is tho
events-chat 2022-01-31 14:59:03 I was born in 2007 but my brother was born in 1999 he taught me a lot about like Lego history and stuff, he also collects a crap ton of Lego from like early 2000s
events-chat 2022-01-31 14:59:52 Dang bro
events-chat 2022-01-31 15:01:42 I mean it does mostly because you are wasting some space, but it‚Äôs not a crazy difference
events-chat 2022-01-31 15:02:13 Just replace the bottom with half‚Äôs and remove the disconnectors and then lock guns into it
events-chat 2022-01-31 15:02:43 But if u locked it you wouldn‚Äôt be out of space <:ElonApprove:589130525315301380>
events-chat 2022-01-31 15:03:17 I just think it would be best to lock so u can have more room for other stuff
events-chat 2022-01-31 15:03:44 If you‚Äôre still inclined to keep it that way it‚Äôs alright
events-chat 2022-01-31 17:24:39 Awesome plane
events-chat 2022-01-31 17:24:56 What I really love is the amount of logic that goes into that build
creations-chat 2022-01-31 23:14:54 <@!404509323360862209> BRO ITS SUCH A BEAUTIFUL AIRBOAT- GREAT JOB
creations-chat 2022-02-05 01:31:51 I was trying to add to the steampunk look, you don't need to like it if you don't want to lol
creations-chat 2022-02-08 15:36:11 Facts
events-chat 2022-02-08 15:44:14 <@!774696277669314602> shouldn‚Äôt a HE-PLANE have like the same colors as He man

creations-chat 2022-02-11 02:57:29 If anything, you could probably add better detail by just covering it up; extra stuff super quantum plates or smthn I don‚Äôt freaking know
creations-chat 2022-02-13 04:07:45 <@!853750272529399809> People propose with flowers?
creations-chat 2022-02-13 04:41:26 Touche LMAO (not to start arguments or anything but I was trying to make a steampunk themed ship) <@!853750272529399809>
creations-chat 2022-02-14 00:27:21 Why skull? It was an old attempt like from march 2021 or somethn around there
creations-chat 2022-02-14 00:29:22 What's the IP address to that server
creations-chat 2022-02-14 00:32:48 I mean ig not, it was collecting dust for a while until I decided to tinker a bit
creations-chat 2022-02-15 01:33:13 <@!346438146549874688> Yo that cheeta mount is insane, great job
creations-chat 2022-02-15 02:01:22 No problem
creations-chat 2022-02-15 23:21:55 <@!714878625484243101> Isn‚Äôt that just a little boy bomb?
creations-chat 2022-02-15 23:24:02 <@!698911110773866576> Where is the cockpit on that plane?

<@!698911110773866576> How is that obvious it looks like a squash; also no cockpit windshield
creations-chat 2022-02-15 23:26:41 Nah it‚Äôs proportional to a little boy bomb, nothing really make it  a, ‚Äúbig boy‚Äù

<@!698911110773866576> Listen bro I like to make sci fi stuff too, but you should at least make it evident where a cockpit would be (adding some sort of windshield or optical device) not trying to start an argument or anything just tryna give u a tip

<@!375281006091173890> Oh that‚Äôs where the cockpit is??? üíÄ
creations-chat 2022-02-15 23:30:42 Ah ok well u should make that more evident so people don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a gun or some random little thing (I thought that) I also recommend changing the afterburner design; rocket makes trail look like fard (religious obligation)
creations-chat 2022-02-15 23:38:40 It‚Äôs aesthetic wdym how

<@!375281006091173890> True
creations-chat 2022-02-15 23:41:00 Also lower the nose, it looks like a squash and also covers intakes so bad logic; add a sign or somethn to the camera that makes it evident it‚Äôs a camera and not just a random tube
events-chat 2022-02-15 23:46:34 We can make mechs?
events-chat 2022-02-15 23:46:55 That‚Äôs what I was thinking

events-chat 2022-02-20 14:44:29 Way too fat and non rigid to be a zeppelin
events-chat 2022-02-20 14:47:31 Hindenburg was flawed; unfunny üë∫
events-chat 2022-02-20 14:48:57 Nah it was flawed because the gas it used was highly flammable, not because it hit a tower. If it hit a tower I don‚Äôt think it would be a zeppelin anymore‚Ä¶
events-chat 2022-02-20 14:49:51 Makes sense

events-chat 2022-02-20 14:52:07 That‚Äôs pretty big
events-chat 2022-02-20 14:53:05 Just cover your motorlock ez ez ez
events-chat 2022-02-20 14:54:01 Not necessarily, but in some temperament you are correct in the sense that if you add a crap ton of blocks to the side you‚Äôre more likely to deflect random crap thrown at u <:hahaa:773727260539617280>
events-chat 2022-02-20 14:54:52 Yes good look that‚Äôs what I meant by other blocks that may be unnecessary

events-chat 2022-02-20 20:59:05 Yes missing propellers, and an undercarriage
events-chat 2022-02-20 21:00:36 Ohh yes you‚Äôre absolutely correct my bad, I thought those were planes- I was thinking of Graf style zeppelins, not the WWI zeppelins; my bad.

creations-chat 2022-02-22 19:01:42 It‚Äôs not feedback, it‚Äôs just random stuff that he likes to tell me but I choose not to give a crap lol. Not starting an argument just choosing not to give a crap. 
Maybe you don‚Äôt understand what societal conformity means

<@!460531752033845258> I‚Äôm not stopping him from saying what he wants, I choose to fix what I find appropriate. If he has a problem with that he can go scream in his pillow. Also as I have previously explained, this is an old design and it correlates to the old video. I have made other edits recently
creations-chat 2022-02-22 19:04:46 Also why should I care what u think, your only rank is expert designer and pixel artist <:Mhm:551152556324159488>

If you have a problem with that then go scream in a pillow little man

creations-chat 2022-02-22 20:06:14 Hey not to start an argument or anything but there are gonna be a lot of people in this server that may not agree with you on a certain topic, tbh my advice would be just keep doing what you‚Äôre doing and not listen to toxic people unless they are actually offering you valuable advice
creations-chat 2022-02-22 20:08:44 Oh don‚Äôt worry, it‚Äôs not real feedback it‚Äôs just blatant opinion so I don‚Äôt really care about it :)) if you care so much about me not caring then I‚Äôm sorry since I can‚Äôt really help u.

creations-chat 2022-02-23 14:49:30 <@!773287769488752653> Good looking tank overall, some tips I would give you are
1. Try staying consistent between color transitions like camo 

2. Add some more texture to the larger exterior parts of the tank like main hull, wheels and treads

3. I think the top of the hull could use a little more detail

4. I think you should replace the front dozer with maybe some sandbags and/or some extra armor; dozer isn‚Äôt too common on a tank

creations-chat 2022-03-14 19:47:22 <@!581608044417515521> Here is a representation of why both wheels are not going to be at the same angle during turning. Red line represents axel, yellow lines represent tires, and blue lines represent the tire direction. In order to create a full 360 degree turn you would need to have the wheel on the opposite side of the direction you are turning, turned at a lower angle than the wheel on the side you are turning toward. Tire on the right is slightly more aligned then the tire on the left
creations-chat 2022-03-15 05:52:35 Why didn't you incorporate it in your build then

creations-chat 2022-04-21 21:43:59 How are u going to fit another motor lock tower in there bro

Yes I see the rigidity in the head, that was one of the first things I noticed
creations-chat 2022-04-21 21:46:28 Remove the propeller on the front, remove the rockets, add 2 engines to each wing, make wing tips flat, make the back wing rigid, add a cockpit, add doors, add landing gear, add gunners, make nose less sharp
creations-chat 2022-04-21 21:49:03 Ok whatever you struggled with or didn‚Äôt get on, get it on and also work on wings because they look very blocky
creations-chat 2022-04-21 21:59:57 Bro the ones behind your wing. Why are there rockets there
creations-chat 2022-04-21 22:03:54 Ohh ok that makes more sense, I think you should work on the engine design first tho

creations-chat 2022-04-21 22:45:18 Bro same I love the butter, I use the fake liquid butter that comes in a bottle tho because IMO it‚Äôs much richer in flavor and also it‚Äôs healthier so
creations-chat 2022-04-21 22:47:01 True, I drench my bag in butter. My mom got mad at me one time because I used so much of the bottle lmao

<@729396282493501504> Would u rather go sweet or savory when it comes to popcorn
creations-chat 2022-04-21 22:49:09 Bro SAME I love to dump a crap ton of chocolate chips in my bag especially when it‚Äôs melted <@525637460676313088> It‚Äôs alright you can have an opinion too :))

creations-chat 2022-04-25 04:06:46 Why are you telling me this
creations-chat 2022-04-25 04:09:04 I never asked you if you found it funny or not tho
creations-chat 2022-04-25 04:11:05 This is ‚Äúcreations_chat‚Äù
creations-chat 2022-04-25 04:12:47 Calm down lol it‚Äôs not that deep
creations-chat 2022-04-25 04:15:34 I‚Äôm just not sure someone would care to talk about it tbh
creations-chat 2022-04-25 04:17:29 Huh
creations-chat 2022-04-25 16:43:53 <@766369468347580437> I really liked how you made the blending afterburner effect on your jet
creations-chat 2022-04-25 16:53:04 I think you have a large ego bro, you criticize others in a non-constructive way and you engage arguments

<@393527373729103888> So because someone is calling you names you are going to call them names back?
creations-chat 2022-04-25 16:56:52 Bro why are u trying to convince him that it‚Äôs a good color, if you like the color and he‚Äôs not giving you any real justification as to why not to use it then use it. Do you know how many times people have told me ‚ÄúbRo YoUr bUiLd StInkS‚Äù and how many times I‚Äôve said ‚ÄúI want to build how I want to build regardless of your opinion <:nooo:787097964946259978>‚Äú

Ye
creations-chat 2022-04-25 16:59:44 Ye, arguing with a wall ain‚Äôt gonna change what it‚Äôs made out of
creations-chat 2022-04-25 17:02:56 No, he didn‚Äôt ask for your criticism; I post builds here all the time and whenever somebody tries to give me criticism that is not constructive, I really just do not care what they think. You chose to give him that criticism and then you instigate it by fallaciously calling out that he has a ‚Äúbig ego‚Äù
creations-chat 2022-04-25 17:05:21 No, your post was the first post given; you‚Äôre saying you believe this is a constructive post?

<@581500505759416340> Doesn‚Äôt matter what people think, u build what u want to build
creations-chat 2022-04-25 17:08:08 Well here‚Äôs the thing buddy, you didn‚Äôt give it to them. Assuming that someone is gonna ask YOU specifically how they can improve, after giving no constructive criticism of any kind and only calling out flaws, makes your ego pretty clear

<@393527373729103888> We‚Äôre not talking about previous incidents. Stop trying to get off track

<@720024036863901717> Maybe he did in the past but that is not what we are discussing right now
creations-chat 2022-04-25 17:10:26 We don‚Äôt need to say that tho, we should only be saying what is happening not adding ‚Äúshit‚Äù or ‚Äúcrap‚Äù to the end of it

<@393527373729103888> Neither do I, why don‚Äôt you enlighten us?

<@393527373729103888> Next time you need to tell the player how they can improve directly after you point out flaws. If you don‚Äôt wish to instigate arguments and stuff you shouldn‚Äôt use critical terms like calling the entire build crap. Only call out parts that need direct improvement
creations-chat 2022-04-25 17:14:14 I mean this is pretty true

<@456226577798135808> People who can‚Äôt give constructive feedback to others
creations-chat 2022-04-25 17:17:40 If you don‚Äôt know how to fix it then you clearly don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs wrong with it and are just calling out random stuff

<@581500505759416340> You shouldn‚Äôt say the entire thing is bad since you‚Äôre only calling out certain aspects
creations-chat 2022-04-25 17:20:56 Bro why are u exaggerating to make a point <:nooo:787097964946259978> 
I‚Äôm not looking for improvement from you Fleet trust me I‚Äôve seen enough from you

creations-chat 2022-04-25 17:27:02 Bro I didn‚Äôt think it was this hard for someone to understand but I guess I forgot this place existed

<@375281006091173890> Thank you
creations-chat 2022-04-25 17:29:04 Hey bro

Yeah u

Guess what

I was actually talking about you



<@375281006091173890> You‚Äôre not someone I‚Äôd turn to for ‚Äúlogic‚Äù

Similar to how you answer me, ‚ÄúThis is feedback channel so u will get feedback‚Äù welcome to Fleet‚Äôs logic land
creations-chat 2022-04-25 17:32:07 So if I‚Äôm talking in 3rd person and I respond to someone, that means I‚Äôm not talking about them? <:duck2:652569235469369375><:duck4:652569237143158794>
creations-chat 2022-04-25 17:34:31 Hey bro can I see some of your ‚Äúawesome‚Äù builds :))
creations-chat 2022-04-25 17:40:17 2nd one is alright.

1st 2nd and 3rd need more color variation,

Afterburners on 1st are kinda flat I would recommend using panels or somethn to get the shape more accurate

3rd, wings don‚Äôt look proportionate to the hull 

4th, main wing tips and windshield need some work, you should try to finish off the wings a little more sharper on the ends
creations-chat 2022-04-25 17:43:57 If that‚Äôs true, I don‚Äôt think you would have liked it if I judged you the same way you judged <@839451762205392897> ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

creations-chat 2022-04-29 22:52:23 Wish I could say the same whenever you speak in this server <:hahaa:773727260539617280>

<@492815944666578975> ?
creations-chat 2022-04-29 22:55:04 What‚Äôs wrong with that, it‚Äôs a nice windshield variation

<@375281006091173890> The same point in time when getoutdood asked for your comment :))

creations-chat 2022-04-29 23:03:29 Not sure he knows exactly what a biplane is :/
creations-chat 2022-04-29 23:11:29 It is factual
creations-chat 2022-04-29 23:15:21 <@389378589914562565> You should change the color of the light part of the wheels on your plane, I would suggest using like a 80 80 85 or somethn

You could use a light grey or a whitish color that won‚Äôt light up
creations-chat 2022-04-30 16:04:59 <@752908414371233793> you should make the propeller on that seaplane less skinny, you could modify a regular propeller
creations-chat 2022-05-01 00:36:23 No
creations-chat 2022-05-01 00:40:08 Irl, pilots' arms don't stick out the plane    <@287454032250011649> That's if we are talking realistic, not theoretically lol
creations-chat 2022-05-01 00:56:28 Were you trying to dodge bot when you misspelled that name or did you make a typo

creations-chat 2022-05-01 22:32:26 <@337690534040698882> You should make the bullfrog dark green, I think it would look cooler
creations-chat 2022-05-01 22:34:41 What about yellowish green, you could also add rust or damage to it

<@337690534040698882> Yeah you‚Äôre right lol I don‚Äôt like yellowish green too much either, another color option would be like beige-ish. You could make some seriously nice color variations with that
creations-chat 2022-05-01 22:56:24 B-17 right? looks awesome

creations-chat 2022-05-06 17:56:06 I mean it‚Äôs not the best

<@448677698773057547> Instead of being critical we could help the player

creations-chat 2022-05-06 18:00:09 <@719168864705052802> I understand that persons build is not the greatest but instead of being critical we could help the player improve
creations-chat 2022-05-06 18:02:23 No being critical isn‚Äôt constructive young lad
creations-chat 2022-05-06 18:04:35 Alright big dog calm down, if being critical is all you can do to a player then you shouldn‚Äôt give feedback

<@393527373729103888> I mean critical as in not giving any constructive responses to, ‚Äúa work of literature, music or art‚Äù
creations-chat 2022-05-06 18:07:30 Actually helping them improve is what games them improve, not being a jerk

<@685909594932773033> Yes ofc but they didn‚Äôt tell him that.

creations-chat 2022-05-06 19:18:25 Uh huh. Anyway, here is my new favorite Fleet moment; hypocrisy at its finest üëå
creations-chat 2022-05-06 19:20:42 As I‚Äôve explained earlier, I didn‚Äôt mean critique when I said critical, I was referring to criticism

<@567763933952475157> No I‚Äôm not a bully. If you want to do that, that is your issue

<@791976765123592233> You we‚Äôre talking about when I said ‚Äúcritical‚Äù <:nooo:787097964946259978> stop being slow
creations-chat 2022-05-06 19:22:50 Criticism is for the hypocrites and the arrogant bruv

<@719168864705052802> Maybe you didn‚Äôt see the message but I wasn‚Äôt referring to the word ‚Äúcritique‚Äù when I said critical; I was referring to blatant criticism

creations-chat 2022-05-06 19:34:24 Oh, I wasn‚Äôt crying lol I was just letting you know you should be more concise and less critical instead of pointing out only flaws

<@456226577798135808> Yeah but people can still change tho, even Hars
creations-chat 2022-05-06 19:36:46 Not necessarily, complaining could be taken in different ways but it‚Äôs usually defined as like pointing out dissatisfaction. Many people correlate dissatisfaction with crying tho lmao
creations-chat 2022-05-06 19:38:30 Why are u calling yourself that?

<@567763933952475157> Doesn‚Äôt make it any more correct

creations-chat 2022-05-06 23:46:51 That‚Äôs not the point, my ego isn‚Äôt harming anyone and these people use irrelevant comments as justification for treating people wrong.

<@769636174259814440> My bad bro I didn‚Äôt realize my ego was hurting your feelings
creations-chat 2022-05-06 23:50:23 Listen, my ego isn‚Äôt hurting anyone. You are committing  the fallacy ‚Äúad hominem‚Äù by using my ego as a justification for your argument. I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve noticed in the past few minutes I never called u a dumbass, yet u continue to use irrelevant terms to try and ‚Äúwin‚Äù the argument instead of giving an actual rebuttal like cmon bruh. My justification for you not giving accurate feedback was your methods and your skill level. Your justification for your argument was me supposedly being ‚Äúa dumbass‚Äù
creations-chat 2022-05-06 23:52:19 <@769636174259814440> My justification for you not giving accurate feedback was your methods and your skill level. Your justification for your argument was me supposedly being ‚Äúa dumbass.‚Äù Tell me which argument YOU think is less irrelevant.

<@769636174259814440> No YOU are wrong, if I knew I was wrong I would‚Äôve stopped typing young lad
creations-chat 2022-05-06 23:54:32 You‚Äôre justification is irrelevant bruh, you‚Äôre literally referring to past issues and still referring to me as a ‚Äúdumbass‚Äù

@Jesse.#3179 Did u ask him for feedback

<@853042393309904897> Irrelevant arguments from mr bogchostbull himself
creations-chat 2022-05-06 23:56:32 I was never attacking you‚Ä¶ you were attacking me by repeatedly calling me ‚Äúdumbass‚Äù and then backing THAT up by claiming it‚Äôs true. Also I just pinged Bruhfo

<@769636174259814440> Bro just like earlier, GIVE CONSTRUCTIVE FEEDBACK. It‚Äôs not that hard young lad
creations-chat 2022-05-06 23:58:15 You can believe whatever you want lol

<@375281006091173890> It‚Äôs been going on for 20 minutes, last time I checked they aren‚Äôt the same
creations-chat 2022-05-07 00:00:25 <@769636174259814440> You can call yourself whatever you want, the only ‚Äúlabels‚Äù you‚Äôll ever earn is in front of people like u. I entered this chat to prevent Bruhfo from being attacked by a toxic young kid like you

<@375281006091173890> Oh mb I thought u meant since I interfered
creations-chat 2022-05-07 00:02:48 That is absolutely not true, he asked me to help even things out but I didn‚Äôt ask him to continue arguing. I am only trying to mediate things here lol

<@375281006091173890> I was not aware that Bruhfo called everyone bipolar, but Bogchost‚Äôs feedback and reaction is not okay
creations-chat 2022-05-07 00:04:46 As I informed Fleet, I was not aware that Bruhfo called people bipolar. <@745389882607927337> Is this true?
creations-chat 2022-05-07 00:06:37 I was not aware of him saying that, but what was he reacting to? There must‚Äôve been a reason he reacted that way
creations-chat 2022-05-07 00:09:30 I should have reviewed the entire situation before attempting to mediate things here so mb for that, but still if someone throws a rock you shouldn‚Äôt throw the entire freaking US military at them. <@745389882607927337> If your build is downvoted it doesn‚Äôt really matter. If u like it, that‚Äôs what matters; Not the opinions of others. It wasn‚Äôt right to call everyone bipolar tho just because of a game

Im not looking for forgiveness from people like you <@769636174259814440>
creations-chat 2022-05-07 00:11:49 Not looking for any sort of recognition or forgiveness from people like you. Keep your comments and your special feedback to yourself unless you have something constructive to give
creations-chat 2022-05-07 00:13:30 Ok so you were purposely trying to get him angry for the laughing matter of it? You are contradicting yourself here, Bog.

@Jesse.#3179 No it isn‚Äôt funny
creations-chat 2022-05-07 00:21:36 So me and Bog had a pointless dm convo, here is a recap
creations-chat 2022-05-07 00:23:18 Don‚Äôt worry Fleet you‚Äôre the last person I‚Äôll ever ask for anything <:nooo:787097964946259978>

@Jesse.#3179 Stop you‚Äôre only making this worse
creations-chat 2022-05-07 00:26:24 Hey man just a tip for future reference, when you give give an insult to someone that gave you an insult, that won‚Äôt end the argument and won‚Äôt help your case. It‚Äôs all irrelevant

<@938196250791141386> Actually sir it‚Äôs ‚Äúouyre‚Äù
creations-chat 2022-05-07 00:29:04 I‚Äôm 15, also it‚Äôs not about ‚Äúwinning‚Äù or ‚Äúlosing.‚Äù Those terms are for people who don‚Äôt care about contributing to the people and only care about their image. If you have a problem with the way I deal with situations, I do not really care 


<@738091123590824000> Also saying ‚Äúit‚Äôs pointless‚Äù and, ‚Äúyour justification is irrelevant‚Äù are two different things.
creations-chat 2022-05-07 00:32:49 Mb I thought u meant that in a negative way, also no you are incorrect about that; me saying ‚Äúyour justification is irrelevant‚Äù is **not** purposed on making the other person look like an idiot. It is based on whether or not the other person gives me an actual base for their claim or not

Yep, typo
creations-chat 2022-05-07 00:38:50 U gotta focus on the upvotes, the downvotes are just people tryna pull u down and take your focus away from the good stuff
creations-chat 2022-05-07 00:40:50 Look at the number that has the people who actually will contribute somethn to you and not just try and drag you down. It doesn‚Äôt matter how many downvotes your build has, you keeping your build up there is showing them that you don‚Äôt care what they say
creations-chat 2022-05-07 00:43:54 This is the kind of stuff u guys should ignore, build how you want to build and don‚Äôt let anyone else tell you otherwise. Learn to identify who is going to try and bring you down

<@567763933952475157> Don‚Äôt ask them why, if u ask them why you are giving them the attention they want

<@738091123590824000> I hope I‚Äôve gotten through to you when I say I do not care what people think
creations-chat 2022-05-07 00:46:36 I hope I‚Äôve gotten through to you when I say I do not care what people think. Also you‚Äôre not part of the people I‚Äôm trying to help so by all means, ignore my ‚Äúpreachings‚Äù

<@738091123590824000> I‚Äôm not telling you about it‚Ä¶
creations-chat 2022-05-07 00:48:24 I do not care how annoying I sound to you or any of your misguided friends, nothing u say will affect my views

<@738091123590824000> You are the one who is calling me pretentious and annoying so I am simply pointing out my view
creations-chat 2022-05-07 00:50:34 And you don‚Äôt need to respond to everything I say or every interaction I have in this channel young lad*

<@738091123590824000> *What does my age have to do with whether or not I interact in a channel?*
creations-chat 2022-05-07 00:52:49 No my ego is not fragile, I‚Äôve been told many things in the past as attempts to ‚Äúshatter my ego‚Äù not just in this server but in other places to and none of them have been successful. 


<@738091123590824000> Young lad is simply an expression, I doubt you are older than 15 tho judging by the way you are acting
creations-chat 2022-05-07 00:54:33 Why are you replying to me with, ‚Äúok, and?‚Äù If you‚Äôre the one who I‚Äôm assuming expected a response <:nooo:787097964946259978>
creations-chat 2022-05-07 14:02:08 <@874912257128136734> It is indeed a nice little ship üëç

Also when u wrote ‚Äúblack powder‚Äù I think you meant gunpowder
creations-chat 2022-05-07 14:08:21 <@321114893489012748> Try to make blue rocket trails less apparent, instead of using rockets you should use fireworks since they tend to be more effective (make sure to blend them in well with the rest of the plane), hide your exposed motorlock patch, texture you jet, add more color variation, remove white and black streaks or make them less ‚Äústand-outish‚Äù
creations-chat 2022-05-07 14:10:15 Use textures; like sand for less solid blocks, or slate for rough surfaces. You could also use diamond plate for specified areas

Also make sure you widen your hind wings, they are way too small
creations-chat 2022-05-07 14:12:52 Uh oh I think an argument is coming

And here comes Fleet the de-initiator of arguments
creations-chat 2022-05-07 14:15:39 Hey let‚Äôs try not to start anything guys, <@697143509089517578> Shaders modify the way the game is viewed. If at any time you see more realistic lighting or textures, it is most likely that you‚Äôre looking at a shader rendered image

<@297120728342331392> No it‚Äôs not lol just don‚Äôt get frustrated easily
creations-chat 2022-05-07 14:17:32 You didn‚Äôt tell him how to rebuild the entire thing, you just told him what was ‚Äúbad‚Äù about his plane
creations-chat 2022-05-07 14:19:56 See this is what lots of people in pcc believe; telling someone what is wrong with their build is not telling them **how** to fix it. It‚Äôs such a common misconception

<@771407578285867108> Well alright but still you should try to give more constructive feedback towards your peers so they can actually benefit from it and not just know that it is ‚Äúbad‚Äù
creations-chat 2022-05-07 14:25:03 I see potential in your jet so I am going to upvote it <@321114893489012748>
creations-chat 2022-05-07 14:27:12 I mean it‚Äôs the truth tho

<@771407578285867108> You sure did
creations-chat 2022-05-07 14:40:47 <@716996057099141140> Better color variation, more texturing, more details to improve less basic look overall, use regular glass instead of legacy glass, make large ship cannons instead of tiny turrets
creations-chat 2022-05-07 14:51:05 Bruh it‚Äôs one downvote, you shouldn‚Äôt care about one downvote
creations-chat 2022-05-07 14:54:52 Yeah I agree with this, I would blend it in with the surrounding areas a little better
creations-chat 2022-05-07 15:04:28 Well alr

creations-chat 2022-05-07 22:47:33 Never heard of black powder, young lad and yes I am American
creations-chat 2022-05-07 22:51:35 California isn‚Äôt in the northeast <:nooo:787097964946259978>
creations-chat 2022-05-07 23:53:00 There‚Äôs no way you are older than me judging by the way you act and speak.

In your earlier message you said northeast, your message was edited

<@738091123590824000> Sorry I don‚Äôt believe that

Yeah I don‚Äôt blame you, I wouldn‚Äôt give out personal information on discord.

This is what I‚Äôm talking about, you don‚Äôt stop with the insults lmao
creations-chat 2022-05-07 23:55:46 Yeah man just more entertainment for the **very** mature ‚Äú17‚Äù year old

creations-chat 2022-05-08 14:49:40 <@832440010313170944> Isn‚Äôt your linear motor just a piston variant with suspension?
creations-chat 2022-05-09 00:13:13 <@300064258824208388> Micro-detailing is something I would like to see more in plane crazy, very nice job üëç
creations-chat 2022-05-09 00:19:21 Still looks awesome and shows what a small amount of time and a large amount of innovation can give in plane crazy :))
creations-chat 2022-05-09 00:24:11 The incorporation of large water turbines and other industrial features, it is not *just* sail powered.
creations-chat 2022-05-09 00:26:24 Not sure if you saw it or not but my ship does have sails, they are rolled up though.
creations-chat 2022-05-09 00:28:06 Leave it on the downvote. Don't tell me that you didn't like something unless you have something to actually contribute to me.
creations-chat 2022-05-09 00:31:45 Well the ship could be relying on fossil fuels, or it could be docked at a harbor?

<@375281006091173890> <@287454032250011649> Maybe you didn‚Äôt read the message but as I recently informed awesomenessbyme, ‚ÄúLeave it on the downvote. Don‚Äôt tel me that you didn‚Äôt like something unless you have something to actually contribute to me.‚Äù

Also I never asked for either of your feedbacks, and you are the last people I would ask for feedback

<@375281006091173890> Calm down young lad, why you getting so angy
creations-chat 2022-05-09 00:33:58 It does have an interior young lad

<@287454032250011649> If you care very little about my opinion, what makes you think I‚Äôm gonna care about you giving me yours? This is the logic of Fleet gang
creations-chat 2022-05-09 00:36:34 You‚Äôre not making yourself look educated by acting like a pissbaby and saying whatever cusses you learned in remedial math young lad

I know that‚Äôs all you can say because no one could tell you otherwise due to your lack of posting ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

<@375281006091173890> Yes Fleet all of your 14 year old buddies see what you mean
creations-chat 2022-05-09 00:39:02 I‚Äôm not the one acting like a pissbaby rn tho

<@456226577798135808> No good sir I am not a f√¥ut

<@375281006091173890> Nice, you aren‚Äôt colorblind <:hahaa:773727260539617280> üëç
creations-chat 2022-05-09 00:40:54 Nice
creations-chat 2022-05-09 00:42:52 Pov when uneducated 14 year olds try to make comebacks. If you aren't colorblind, I am happy for you young lad

<@551806781609869313> Sails are for non-reserve movement, for example a sailor may use turbines at times when short on fossil fuels or when winds are strong.  They could also be used in unison likewise to maximize speed

<@287454032250011649> You probably watch Mr Beast

<@375281006091173890> Listen man if you feel intimidated or something by my builds then by all means go ahead and post a build of your own for once in a century; this time, why don‚Äôt you make it something other than an actual place where people take dumps considering your last build was a public bathroom
creations-chat 2022-05-09 00:48:34 I mean anybody with sense of sight can see you are an unreasonable and uneducated person, you don‚Äôt quit with insults, your arguments have no justification whatsoever and you are a hypocrite

<@375281006091173890> I didn‚Äôt use any words from other languages bruh, is English not your first language?
creations-chat 2022-05-09 00:50:55 Alright lol 

<@866848584888877077> True, walls can‚Äôt be reasoned with
creations-chat 2022-05-09 00:53:45 What's the issue?

<@456226577798135808> Just walls
creations-chat 2022-05-09 00:55:33 It‚Äôs not everybody, just the toxic players like you. There are good people in this server and you‚Äôve made quite clear you are not one of them
creations-chat 2022-05-09 00:57:28 Oh that's not true, that's just you're opinion and I've made quite clear that the opinions of others do not effect me
creations-chat 2022-05-09 00:59:10 Sounds logical lmao
creations-chat 2022-05-09 01:01:20 My builds are off-brand snacks? I guess you could say that, my builds promote non-conformity
creations-chat 2022-05-09 01:03:35 You didn't give me feedback, you gave me blatant criticism; don't be in shock when you find yourself in arguments soon after your special "feedback." You shouldn't give people anything unless they ask for it

<@554300932217765888> I want constructive feedback, not insults. This server has the most ignorant people
creations-chat 2022-05-09 01:05:34 Ive literally never shed a tear during any dialogue in this server‚Ä¶ the only facial expression I‚Äôve made in dialogues with people like you is halfway between a belch and a grimace. It looks like the kind of face you‚Äôd make when you‚Äôre in a gamer session

<@554300932217765888> All you have is blatant insults and then you wonder why I don‚Äôt accept your precious feedback <:nooo:787097964946259978>
creations-chat 2022-05-09 01:07:42 Probably gonna happen soon, people like Fleet don‚Äôt contribute jack to this server

<@554300932217765888> Well according to your buddies, that‚Äôs adequate feedback
creations-chat 2022-05-09 01:10:57 I find it really amusing how people like fleet who try to give me what they call, ‚Äúfeedback‚Äù  me is a low rank player; Not including Fleet since his ranks are not low, but kind of promotes the hypocrisy
creations-chat 2022-05-09 01:13:45 Eh just let it go, these hypocrites can‚Äôt be reasoned with

<@694235233368801400> The ship is not powered by steam it‚Äôs powered by fossil fuels and presumably has an exhaust but I‚Äôll need to add that on
creations-chat 2022-05-09 01:15:44 Walls

<@466793357318815744> Ah thank you
creations-chat 2022-05-09 01:18:19 As explained twice already, the engine runs on fossil fuels so I‚Äôll most likely need to make some sort of conversion chamber detailing.
Thank you for good feedback and lack of blatant insults
creations-chat 2022-05-09 01:20:23 Thanks for knockin‚Äô some sense into them <@466793357318815744>

<@375281006091173890> Maybe you‚Äôll remember next time

<@853042393309904897> Yes lol
creations-chat 2022-05-09 01:22:31 Yeah u are one of the competent people in this chat :))
creations-chat 2022-05-09 01:24:23 You are here, that is usually not a good sign for anyone looking for good feedback

<@466793357318815744> Interesting
creations-chat 2022-05-09 01:26:12 No, everyone‚Äôs voice should be heard and no one should be muted just because they are being toxic; even if it is someone like Fleet

<@738091123590824000> Don‚Äôt be a hypocrite bro
creations-chat 2022-05-09 01:27:56 So being pro freedom of speech is being entitled? That‚Äôs a new one
creations-chat 2022-05-09 01:30:29 How would you know wierdo üëÄ 

<@897250114719080508> Facts

<@738091123590824000> That Walter white-name is more mature than you
creations-chat 2022-05-09 01:32:28 Ignoring a message and deleting it are two different things, kid

<@738091123590824000> Still doesn‚Äôt change the fact I never asked u for ‚Äúfeedback‚Äù :))
creations-chat 2022-05-09 01:35:19 I‚Äôm just going to block u guys, there is no point in trying to reason with some 13 year olds typing on their moms android
creations-chat 2022-05-09 01:37:12 LMAO
creations-chat 2022-05-09 01:38:53 Accurate except no one is standing there anymore

creations-chat 2022-05-09 02:02:18 I got a few questions for you

1. Have you seen a ship that looks like mine irl?

2. The sails are for reserving fuel; I‚Äôve explained the fuel conservation system earlier today


<@695457559989190686> Maybe I‚Äôll transition the ships motif

<@453015366281723905> Idk ask ship manufacturers, I‚Äôm not a ship manufacturer yet
creations-chat 2022-05-09 02:05:54 I was going for the motif rather than the steam function, most likely I‚Äôll transition my ship to a diesel-punk motif
creations-chat 2022-05-09 02:08:26 That‚Äôs because it **is** a sail ship with engines strapped on it, lore is basically that it was modified to fit the energy needs and available energy by those who used it.
creations-chat 2022-05-09 03:11:24 Looks cool
creations-chat 2022-05-09 10:50:17 There‚Äôs nothing in there

<@761854427262353408> I agree, it is nice, but I think you should make the basket more bent at a slope, most carts are bent üõí

<@468889548407963658> I‚Äôm talking about irl, like how an actual shopping cart maneuvers. Yes I‚Äôm American too
creations-chat 2022-05-09 20:16:08 I never said move I said turn

<@761854427262353408> They don‚Äôt turn

creations-chat 2022-05-10 13:45:30 Your mech looks pretty cool too as a first mech

The Paladin was my 4th mech I think, my first 3 weren‚Äôt the best but my Paladin was definitely an exclusion

creations-chat 2022-06-03 18:18:39 <@865663648218742844> Why is it so short, also Maverick is Pete‚Äôs callsign not the name of the plane
creations-chat 2022-06-03 18:22:38 <@389516889501728779> what I like about your plane is how little control you need to turn it so efficiently
creations-chat 2022-06-03 18:25:18 You should make a manual air brake system with like R key or smthn; that would definitely increase pvp effectively in the sense that when you need to slow down fast you can hold R and then maneuver toward your target. You can also slow down before you pass your target to increase likeliness of hitting your target
creations-chat 2022-06-03 18:28:37 What I mean is the air brake doesn‚Äôt have to slow down your plane by a crazy amount, it can slow it down like half the forward force. This would give you more time to remaneuver. Also if you don‚Äôt like overshooting, slowing down before catching a target would increase your chance of getting a hit
creations-chat 2022-06-03 18:31:24 My guy the airbrake doesn‚Äôt need to be at a drastic angle‚Ä¶
It‚Äôs not the wings bruh it‚Äôs the angle that the panels are at

<@389516889501728779> Calm down bro, applying airbrake pressure steadily will steadily decrease your speed; previously I believed u found speed significant or smthn. Also for someone who has done PVP for 2 years I would expect you to value at least pvp effectivity OR speed
creations-chat 2022-06-03 18:40:43 Yes, it does effectively decrease speed in a considerable amount of time

<@938196250791141386> Yea but also the proportion of the panels
creations-chat 2022-06-03 18:47:34 My take on this argument is this:
Just because someone puts a historically relevant symbol on their build DOES NOT mean that they support this group. This vehicle in particular, HAS HISTORIC RELEVANCE. Again, just because the symbol is on a historically relevant build, DOES NOT mean that the builder supports the group. Although I have not reviewed this entire argument, I do believe that Babyskinboots‚Äô build should not be deleted due to historical relevance and significance. Ignoring history does not mean you are cleansing the world of evil, it means you are not letting people be informed on real world events and information which is crucial so people can understand what has happened in the past. Not saying I support the symbol, but the symbol does have historic significance.
creations-chat 2022-06-03 18:55:40 <@670636377792184330> I think that is considered a WIP, I‚Äôd recommend removing it before possibly being warned by mods
creations-chat 2022-06-03 20:50:40 <@668294916274913280> Nice Mig
creations-chat 2022-06-03 20:58:16 <@826842234950910023> Nice Mig, I‚Äôd recommend adding some caging to the cockpit windshield, and try to make the planes weaponry stick out a little less. I‚Äôd recommend making the wings a thicker and making a smaller custom mig wing weaponry (which is more accurate in proportions) and then you could try hiding a firework block or singular rocket launchers within the wing with the rocket portion of the block protruding out the bottom of the wing and into the smaller custom weaponry. I‚Äôd reccomend trying to make something like this (view image attached)

<@914605911744593930> Yes lol
creations-chat 2022-06-03 21:10:29 <@864602524220129321> Bro why are you terminating monkeys, that‚Äôs not cool.

creations-chat 2022-06-06 00:26:37 <@568688233760686081> I mean the rockets are burning some sort of fuel, but logically I feel it doesn‚Äôt necessarily need an exhaust no since whatever it is burning would just exit through the rockets; you‚Äôll have to do some more research on it but I‚Äôm pretty sure exhausts are unnecessary

help 2022-06-11 17:08:19 I‚Äôll list them
help 2022-06-11 17:19:53 <@876900536979435570> 1. Add texture and color variation to the balloon part of the airship

2. Add texture and color variation to the gondola of the airship 

3. Add some nice detailed weaponry, I would recommend making some 60 cal ball turrets on the gondola of the airship (if you like that sort of thing) they don‚Äôt necessarily have to shoot, unless you are bringing this thing out into pvp mode then you can add some gun blocks into them

4. Add some large custom propellers to the side of the gondola so you can control the ship (and also because they look pretty sick)

5. If you are trying to make an adventurous sort of airship I‚Äôd recommend adding a little crane or something to the side of the gondola or a separate cargo chamber for carrying any custom cargo or crates that you may want to add

6. Id recommend adding some cool lights like spotlights with a cross hatch decal on top of them to make it look like caged lighting (go to coolsymbol.com for decals)

7. Maybe add a huge propeller on the end of the blimp to give it a diesel punk kind of vibe 

8. Id recommend adding a controllable ramp that lowers and raises so you can enter and exit the ship

9. You should add a ladder that goes around the hull of the ship or at least to the top of one side and maybe add a separate control area of some sort

10. I‚Äôd recommend adding some heavy duty multi-wheeled retractable landing gear to the bottom of the gondola so when you land it won‚Äôt look like it‚Äôs grinding against the floor
help 2022-06-11 17:20:45 Hope this helps :))
help 2022-06-11 17:20:54 If you need more ideas just let me know
help 2022-06-11 17:34:50 Oh the starting process for building a large hill is pretty simple:
1. Estimate how big you want your ships hull to be (length width height etc.)

2. Next you want to separate your plot into a ‚Äú# x # x #‚Äù kind of grid. Note that this will rely heavily on your hull‚Äôs estimated measurements.

3. Start building the frame of the hull and only the frame; this means building the edge of each plane of the build. For example, when making the vertical frame, you want to estimate what your ships edge would look like from the side view and for your horizontal frame you would want to estimate what your ship would look like from a birds eye view. Note that it helps to start building at the front of your build facing forward

4. After you have the frame of your build created for one of the lower sections of the plot (we will be using the higher sections later) we can work out whatever fold locking mechanism you may choose to use.

5. Once you have finished the fold mechanism, construct a middle vertical frame of your build and make sure to connect it to your fold mechanism. When you click play, and activate the fold mechanism, that vertical frame should connect perfectly into your first section that you constructed. 

6. Now you can continue to build the rest of the hull. Repeat this process as much as necessary until your hull is as long and as big as you need. Remember that side folding is also another option for you in opposition to vertical folding.

7. After you have finished making the model of the hull, you can add details and more complex parts of the ship. 

8. Test flights

9. Coloring and texturing

10. More details 

11. Recoloring and retexturing (in case you aren‚Äôt satisfied with the current look)

12. You‚Äôre done

creations-chat 2022-07-03 17:05:40 <@676808894466752542> I think the afterburners should be a liiiittle more spread out tho.. Other than that, amazing F-14; I really like the detailing and the color scheme. If you wan't to spice up the colors a bit more I'd recommend doing some color gradients. Maybe you could do a color gradient with olive drab and 120 120 123 grey? Although that is just an example I feel it would add some great contrast to the build

contest-chat 2022-07-08 02:34:24 I've never used this technique, but firstly I'd recommend starting with the chassis
contest-chat 2022-07-08 02:34:39 and then making suitable walking mechanics
contest-chat 2022-07-08 02:35:08 I'd also reccomend using suspension for the legs
contest-chat 2022-07-08 02:35:14 and using keybinds E and Q for leg movement
contest-chat 2022-07-08 02:35:39 Np

contest-chat 2022-07-08 02:46:33 I feel like building a titan for this competition would have been way too generic
contest-chat 2022-07-08 02:46:44 Not necessarily, it will get you more votes

contest-chat 2022-07-08 23:05:36 Oh lol
contest-chat 2022-07-08 23:06:02 Reason I don't use TNT configuration techniques is because I want to be able to use my builds in the regular gamemode
