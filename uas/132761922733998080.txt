the-dump 2022-02-23 09:42:08 <:saul:903519198691618827> be careful of this user, he used an exploit in the trading system to steal my $150 green wistful wink
the-dump 2022-02-23 09:43:10 I did message their support
the-dump 2022-02-23 09:43:15 waiting for a response
the-dump 2022-02-23 09:43:28 but it's like 1:42am and this happened like an hour ago
the-dump 2022-02-23 09:43:47 dude I hope I get my wink back, it was the main face I wore for six years <:FeelsBadMan:713126026221453362>
the-dump 2022-02-23 09:44:34 <:saul:903519198691618827> wait we can say the fuck word here?
the-dump 2022-02-23 09:45:21 
the-dump 2022-02-23 09:45:36 when I never made this trade
the-dump 2022-02-23 09:46:00 one thing I noticed after the trade is that the user ID is of the scammer account
the-dump 2022-02-23 09:46:08 but it shows the inventory of the snowshlo account
the-dump 2022-02-23 09:46:37 <:FacePalm:815350751773065216> I should have just took their roblox premium from them and just blocked them but I'm a nice guy
the-dump 2022-02-23 09:47:12 <:FeelsBadMan:713126026221453362> I guess I gotta stop trusting people and being so nice because all it's been doing is been biting me in the ass recently
the-dump 2022-02-23 09:48:11 lol I forgot that Shedletsky wanted my wink at one point
the-dump 2022-02-23 09:48:19 is the green wink seriously that high demand?
the-dump 2022-02-23 09:48:58 https://www.roblox.com/users/261/profile#!/about this is his real profile right?
the-dump 2022-02-23 09:49:18 
the-dump 2022-02-23 09:50:24 how do I report a trade
the-dump 2022-02-23 09:50:44 I've reported both the accounts and submit a customer support ticket
the-dump 2022-02-23 09:52:22 I got scammed <:saul:903519198691618827>
the-dump 2022-02-23 09:59:36 <@456226577798135808> I searched them up and found their scratch.mit.edu profile and the comments are flooded with people calling them a scammer and I guess they used to scam people out of their adopt me stuff
the-dump 2022-02-23 09:59:56 latest comments are from like ten months ago
the-dump 2022-02-23 10:00:18 so I'm assuming I'm their first tradeable victim or something, idk. Does anybody else know of this exploit?
the-dump 2022-02-23 10:00:30 Like this is a horrid exploit that needs to be fixed on the website
the-dump 2022-02-23 10:01:30 so bs is that all I have is this plus a month of roblox premium
the-dump 2022-02-23 10:01:44 like bro, why tf would I want some lame ass gucci bag
the-dump 2022-02-23 10:01:56 #1 it's gucci, #2 it's ugly
the-dump 2022-02-23 10:02:09 >Roblox Gucci
the-dump 2022-02-23 10:02:42 no it was done through the actual roblox website
the-dump 2022-02-23 10:02:50 not through a link that looked like roblox
the-dump 2022-02-23 10:03:04 it's not like the discord gift phishing scams
the-dump 2022-02-23 10:04:23 me when my potential $200 gets stolen because shitty kids game can't program a website right
the-dump 2022-02-23 10:05:04 I have the hacker's IP <:saul:903519198691618827>
the-dump 2022-02-23 10:05:07 jk
the-dump 2022-02-23 10:05:27 I wonder where that IP is
the-dump 2022-02-23 10:05:55 No more Ukraine
the-dump 2022-02-23 10:06:18 I could have grabbed his IP lol
the-dump 2022-02-23 10:06:21 I'm not scum tho
the-dump 2022-02-23 10:06:35 yes
the-dump 2022-02-23 10:06:42 it's not that hard

the-dump 2022-02-23 10:06:59 <:saul:903519198691618827> but that's not important

the-dump 2022-02-23 10:10:35 this tutorial isn't that bad he has a good voice
the-dump 2022-02-23 10:11:04 He doesn't sound like he wants my credit card info and my computer data
the-dump 2022-02-23 10:12:09 <@456226577798135808> but basically I would have had to do was link them to a "download" of my playermodel and it would have been just an IP grabber that then redirects to like the discord server file link to my model
the-dump 2022-02-23 10:12:23 and then boom I easily could have snatched his IP
the-dump 2022-02-23 10:12:28 but like I said I'm not scum
the-dump 2022-02-23 10:12:39 why tf we all Asian

the-dump 2022-02-23 10:29:58 yes

the-dump 2022-03-08 14:44:12 I'm Thai but I hate Thai food
the-dump 2022-03-08 15:34:21 no their accounts still exist
the-dump 2022-03-08 15:34:44 RUSSIA IDENTIFIED TAIWAN AS A COUNTRY
the-dump 2022-03-08 15:35:44 but I do have my item back
the-dump 2022-03-08 15:36:10 so what I learned is <:saul:903519198691618827> when getting scammed, just scam the scammer by leaving with their roblox premium before they steal your shit
the-dump 2022-03-08 15:39:02 no
the-dump 2022-03-08 15:39:29 scamming would be me leaving after the dude gave me roblox premium, but in reality he gave me the roblox premium to scam me
