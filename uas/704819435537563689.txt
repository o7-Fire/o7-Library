bug-reports 2021-06-24 02:38:34 My airplane randomly inverts controls. No matter where i spawn.
bug-reports 2021-06-24 03:10:31 even if i spawn at base it messes up half the time
bug-reports 2021-06-24 03:11:06 i made a big b2 bomber and sometimes it takes off with ease and sometimes when i try to lift it sticks to the ground
bug-reports 2021-06-24 21:13:33 update: its bc im an idiot. placement of control surfaces fs matters

creations-chat 2021-10-17 20:12:51 thoughts?
creations-chat 2021-10-17 20:15:34 idk i just used a blueprint and went by that, i can make the top a little thinner lol
creations-chat 2021-10-17 20:18:05 thats also kind how it looks irl
creations-chat 2021-10-17 20:20:19 no

creations-chat 2021-10-26 12:36:39 Intakes
creations-chat 2021-11-11 16:36:53 Don‚Äôt call that a stuka lol. Maybe if you fix it up a little
creations-chat 2021-11-12 14:34:17 Wow
creations-chat 2021-11-18 13:27:06 Wow
creations-chat 2021-11-18 13:47:39 How would that be possible on a wedge
creations-chat 2021-11-18 13:49:42 It would overlap and look glitched lol edit original message if respond

I guess but that‚Äôs very difficult and piston lock is hell
creations-chat 2021-11-18 13:53:57 Oh yeah I didn‚Äôt think about how the piston would be exposed

You can put the piston farther back and use a   camera
creations-chat 2021-11-18 13:56:52 1x0.9 block and cylinder is all I can think of

But I don‚Äôt like using 1x0.9 blocke

Yes the jet is amazing rn
creations-chat 2021-11-18 13:59:42 No circle on wings though
You can by motor locking disconnecter at wing level and put text on that
Yes
Looks like he added some sort of text block idk why there‚Äôs no circle
creations-chat 2021-11-18 14:02:56 I hate this channel slow mode
creations-chat 2021-11-18 14:05:27 Yes but creations itself is toxic bc some people need help and other downvote but won‚Äôt say why so they can improve
bug-reports 2021-11-18 14:14:01 Dang man just pinged rickje
creations-chat 2021-11-18 14:15:29 Yes. Though it is very hard to criticize a build without sounding mean. I told a guy his f35 back horizontal tail things were way too big (they were about at big as the wing itself) and he and his friend got mad and blocked me
bug-reports 2021-11-18 14:21:02 Rules say otherwise. Ik it says unnecessarily but it states don‚Äôt do it in general
creations-chat 2021-11-21 01:55:42 tell him how to improve instead of calling it bad
creations-chat 2021-11-21 01:58:37 true but you can point out key things like make the wings with custom control surfaces, and fix the shape of the fuselage
