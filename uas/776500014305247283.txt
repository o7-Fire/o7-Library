the-dump 2022-08-06 23:02:23 Done
bug-reports 2022-08-13 23:07:16 I dont know if this is a bug or not but i made a missile that blows on impact and for some reason it doesnt damage anything even with a direct hit for details it does not ricochet off targets. But it does bounce off the target but only by 1.5 studs. This problem only occurs when the target is going at high speeds Edit: this also happens with slow target although its is more rare. Edit 2: after the hit targets say i "missed" or it "ricocheted" even though at was a direct hit with no chance of a miss/dodge/ricochet
