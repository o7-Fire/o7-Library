help 2021-12-08 17:54:36 acutally i like the Ca.5

help 2021-12-08 17:56:35 yeh ik im a newbie at motorlock so idk how to make it work
help 2021-12-08 17:57:07 this is the CA.5 you meant right
help 2021-12-08 17:57:22 i got the theory its about trial and error
help 2021-12-08 17:58:41 mm
help 2021-12-08 17:58:54 the best motorlocking i got to so far was making tracks
