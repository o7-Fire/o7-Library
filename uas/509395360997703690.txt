creations-chat 2021-02-16 11:32:48 You are literally arguing about points where you know that the paint looks like garbage but you are to proud on your tutorial build so you defend that, the name is smt you found on your fortnite friendlist and put plane behind it, btw when you ask people why they disliked then its because your build is no effort
creations-chat 2021-02-17 11:57:07 You won that argument
