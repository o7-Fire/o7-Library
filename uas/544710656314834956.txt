[building, pvp]
A system that detects the block count of the creation, and increases your weapon limit accordingly. Currently PVP ~~once you get past the shredders~~ is dominated by small, nimble craft. Large vehicles are not competitive at all in PVP, due to in part the small amount of available weapons. However, simply increasing the limit will only make spammers worse, so I propose something to take the size of the creation and increase weapon limits according to the size. This will allow large creations to be used competitively in PVP, and give more options to players in PVP, as right now, small, nimble jets are the kings of PVP, and small ground vehicles are in second place. With this you could choose to continue building small creations, or you could build a massive battleship with unmatched firepower.
