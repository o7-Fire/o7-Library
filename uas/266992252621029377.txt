creations-chat 2022-12-07 18:11:20 i believe it's because your motors are at too high of a speed + it's so far back so it makes the angle more extreme, if you have 2 motor 2s then there max angles add up so it might be that as well

help 2022-12-07 18:25:25 you mean like keyboard vs mouse or something else?
help 2022-12-07 18:25:52 yeah
help 2022-12-07 18:26:00 motor2 for pitch and keyboard for roll and yaw
help 2022-12-07 18:26:30 i wouldn't say keyboard is fine aim
help 2022-12-07 18:26:57 feels more like it's the other way around
help 2022-12-07 18:27:07 using keyboard lets you do sharper manuevers but less fine tuning
help 2022-12-07 18:27:17 from what i've seen
help 2022-12-07 18:27:24 not for me
help 2022-12-07 18:27:29 idk what experience you've had

help 2022-12-07 18:39:43 i'm really proud of this f-22 nose so far but i don't know how to fix this little overlap cause if i get rid of it the blocks causing the overlap it will have a hole just straight through it
help 2022-12-07 18:40:18 what i mean by hole
creations-chat 2022-12-07 18:42:56 i wasn't talking about the hover engines, i mean like the motors themselves
help 2022-12-07 18:43:09 i did that
help 2022-12-07 18:43:14 see how it doesn't go all the way through
help 2022-12-07 18:43:20 but it still has that gap
help 2022-12-07 18:43:24 piston lock?
help 2022-12-07 18:43:34 haven't heard of that before
help 2022-12-07 18:44:00 i think i understand what you mean by that though
help 2022-12-07 18:44:08 i'll search it up
help 2022-12-07 18:45:02 yep piston lock is exactly what i expected it to be lol
help 2022-12-07 18:45:30 i'll try it rq
help 2022-12-07 18:50:42 yep that worked
