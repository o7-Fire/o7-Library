the-dump 2023-01-24 21:55:39 damn😞
the-dump 2023-01-24 22:20:57 he had a script for how the argument was supposed to go
the-dump 2023-01-24 22:22:04 not every russian is a Z / putin supporter
the-dump 2023-01-24 22:22:28 also dude might not even be old enough to vote (not like a vote matters to putain)
the-dump 2023-01-24 22:24:15 passive supprter is a very slippery slope to argue on
the-dump 2023-01-24 22:25:26 easy way to end argument is just to ask: lorshara do you vote for putin? do you contribute to his war effort?
the-dump 2023-01-24 22:25:39 agreed
the-dump 2023-01-24 22:25:50 give them canned soda cannons too
the-dump 2023-01-24 22:25:57 simple
the-dump 2023-01-24 22:26:25 do you have the ability to vote?
the-dump 2023-01-24 22:26:35 not that a vote in russia really matters
the-dump 2023-01-24 22:27:04 then you dont support russia, simple argument should end
the-dump 2023-01-24 22:27:24 what do you expect a child to do?
the-dump 2023-01-24 22:27:36 start a full revolution on his own?
the-dump 2023-01-24 22:28:06 active resistance is very hard to do when you get arrested for saying something negative about “our glorious war that we are winning trust us”
the-dump 2023-01-24 22:28:54 not everyone who hates putin is in a position to do something about it much less directly help ukraine
the-dump 2023-01-24 22:29:22 not really
the-dump 2023-01-24 22:30:05 thezezz believes that since lorshara doesnt assassinate putin he passively supports him
the-dump 2023-01-24 22:30:46 give me a paperclip, some money, and a fake passport and i could do it though
the-dump 2023-01-24 22:30:58 i wont get muted for saying that right?
the-dump 2023-01-24 22:31:20 you mean the fbi hiring list
the-dump 2023-01-24 22:31:36 hi
the-dump 2023-01-24 22:33:01 i dont think it was specified if they moved there before or after the war started

creations-chat 2023-06-08 14:58:31 reasonably well if i get the wings to deploy right
creations-chat 2023-06-08 20:51:19 nope all control surfaces, i binded them to the arrow keys
creations-chat 2023-06-08 22:01:13 glitchy magic
creations-chat 2023-06-08 22:03:33 the motors on the wings are powered and locked so they dont swing out when just loaded in and theres a block that forces them out since the hitboxes dont like eachother when i move the motor
