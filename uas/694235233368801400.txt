the-dump 2021-04-16 01:28:45 They make it too easy for a mech to get in the hall of fame

creations-chat 2021-05-21 21:36:09 Yes
bot-central 2021-05-29 15:18:16 Oops I suggested something twice lol
bot-central 2021-05-29 15:18:23 I thought it didn't work the first time
creations-chat 2021-07-09 16:55:44 Why would I use an exploit? I used a custom skybox and some shaders.
creations-chat 2021-07-09 17:00:10 In what way are skyboxes and shaders an exploit? Both of them only change the way that I see roblox. plus it works in every roblox game not jsut plane crazy. (they skybox doesn't work in every game though, it only works inbgames that use the default roblox skybox)
creations-chat 2021-07-09 17:03:01 Exactly, plus the shaders even said that no one can be banned from roblox for using it, and this is the discord server for a roblox game
creations-chat 2021-07-09 17:15:15 But this server says nothing about shaders and skyboxes, and neither are considered exploits
creations-chat 2021-07-09 17:17:31 Actually Mine had better angle so imma just delete

creations-chat 2021-07-24 02:03:56 Wasn't the one who picked it
creations-chat 2021-07-24 02:26:22 How? It is the name of a mech from the past.
creations-chat 2021-07-24 02:53:25 nope, the person who did suggested hte name because it looks similar
creations-chat 2021-07-25 15:44:53 <@!831663795884785736> I think your mech is pretty decent for you second mech but PCC just hates mechs because they are uncultured.
creations-chat 2021-07-25 17:58:49 What build of his was a WIP?
creations-chat 2021-07-25 18:23:58 oh hi mega

creations-chat 2021-07-30 15:29:16 Wow everyone here is too much of a stinky head too even explain why they hate  mechs
creations-chat 2021-07-30 15:38:04 You didn't, not many do, but almsot every mech gets way more downvotes than upvotes
creations-chat 2021-07-30 15:44:44 Why are you asking me about a mig?
creations-chat 2021-07-30 15:59:13 hollen but no one ever says what's wrong with it

creations-chat 2021-09-24 22:12:17 if the game is laggy enough or if I go fast enough I can cut right through other buildsif they aren't too thick

creations-chat 2021-12-22 21:59:39 because your plane isn't even good and the turret looks decent. and what's the point of posting a terrible plane, it's quite obvious ir's going to get tons of downvotes.
creations-chat 2021-12-22 22:02:36 1. your plane is the opposite of epic, 2. Tanks don't need ugly weapon spam to be op 3. you are acting like they are so good when they aren't so it's obvious that people will downvote it <@!792070674465423360>
creations-chat 2021-12-22 22:04:46 Ver true, I wouldn't be surprised if he is still a young child. (also cj that looks like a deformed godzilla from this angle lol)
creations-chat 2021-12-22 22:07:38 Ok but motorlock detail = ver gud look
Low effort plain weird shaped weapon spam = terrible
creations-chat 2021-12-22 22:09:43 It doesn't, I motorlock my mechs and they function and look way better than without motorlock. Also you're just skill issue so you think everything you make is good and you think everything other people make and do is bad.
creations-chat 2021-12-22 22:11:51 Then motorlock the sides of the vehicle onto it and you have tons of space for motorlock then B)
creations-chat 2021-12-22 22:13:58 If you're a fairer player then it doesn't make much sense to spam every weapon possible onto on build that even a jet could probably kill easily
creations-chat 2021-12-22 22:16:10 Pretty useless tank then since there is now like a 3/10 chance to find a shredder in a public server. <@!509857272651055126> I killed a shredder with a mech that had a terrible weapon, just to further prove your point.
creations-chat 2021-12-22 22:18:37 I killed it easily with a small tank that uses fireworks and then the pilot of it just rage quit. Also about 70% of public servers I go to have a shredder or 2, rarely any more.
creations-chat 2021-12-22 22:20:58 Then make something that isn't 1 shot, such as an actual good build or something that kills the shredder before it kills you. Also I have very small tanks that were able to kill shredder bugs and shredder balls multiple times.
creations-chat 2021-12-22 22:24:03 To further prove this, I have 2 very small pvp tanks that won 2 build battles in full servers. Also <@!792070674465423360> lol in your example you used a boat and said that a good build can't be not 1 shot.....  most boats are big and not 1 shot can can easily kill a shredder with anti - air guns. Also just dodge a shredder, it isn't hard, they aren't fast.
creations-chat 2021-12-22 22:26:56 1. Dodge. 2. there is a 5 second period of time after you spawn that people cannot damage you while in this period. 3. Just lure them to your plot and blacklist them, they will mald after this happens.
creations-chat 2021-12-22 22:29:07 1. Dodge. 2. It is very likely they will not fling you very far. 3. Blacklist them again and they get reset. 4. Just don't spawn your build and work on smth else. 5. Skill issue

creations-chat 2022-03-08 02:52:42 why would someone jsut give out their bday with no hesitation
creations-chat 2022-03-08 02:54:45 The thing is most people don't give their bday to someone as soon as they are accused of unde, plus we can't confirm it
creations-chat 2022-03-08 02:59:46 multiple people saw the mech as a clone
creations-chat 2022-03-08 03:07:21 a voice is irrelevant, what we were discussing was your clone of 2 different mechs, which you agreed that you copied ame in dm's and even had mashu talk shit to you about it being a clone. and yes it does. we have proof that you copied ame on that mech
creations-chat 2022-03-08 03:12:07 this is the other mech Envi copied, it's called nineball seraph and is used by a respected member of mech comms. Envi copied the color scheeme and overall shape of it
creations-chat 2022-03-08 03:14:25 yes but the frame set aside, what he put on the frame is the parts that were copied. <@!410455661814480896> that is somewhat true
creations-chat 2022-03-08 03:16:44 the shape of th body is very similar, the proportions are also quite similar, and I saw how it was moving around in the ps, fast and quick just like seraph(and the color). Then part of the torso and the leg shapes were copied from walmart falcon, and also the feet and part of the actual armour itself is copied from both. <@!812155616046743572>
creations-chat 2022-03-08 03:20:42 wellthe copies are not form this server but, envi brought the mecch over here showing it off and <@!793829260347310090> decided to let people know that it was a cpoy of some mechs, then fighting started. brb I'm pissing
creations-chat 2022-03-08 03:23:00 I think things will calm down if we forge that thiss happened and you jsut delete th epost for stopping current and future conflict.
creations-chat 2022-03-08 03:26:13 yes but that was a logn time ago, this is right now
creations-chat 2022-03-08 03:28:27 yees
creations-chat 2022-03-08 03:41:20 <:Upvote:490311647492309004>
creations-chat 2022-03-08 03:51:19 Yea which is why we should spend 12 days motorlocking a small mech just to get 30 upvotes and have a block count of 1400.(legit barely any mechs get a reasonable amount of upvotes. Y’all upvote trash trash and downvote pro mechs)

creations-chat 2022-04-25 01:01:42 waht should I name this mech
creations-chat 2022-04-25 01:04:27 bob
creations-chat 2022-05-08 19:01:55 but you see
creations-chat 2022-05-08 19:03:38 his builds do get hundreds of upvotes
creations-chat 2022-05-08 19:05:33 his still get hundreds
creations-chat 2022-05-08 19:08:01 that's easy to get 90
creations-chat 2022-05-08 19:09:55 
creations-chat 2022-05-08 19:17:21 that's exactly what I did and my mech looked shit back then
creations-chat 2022-05-09 01:09:09 so one thing I think could make the ship looks better is more shades for better shading on the boat(the yellow guy's boat)
creations-chat 2022-05-09 01:13:39 Also I think if looks like the machinery is powered by steam, then it might fit the name of steampunk a bit better. There are plenty of examples like this (I'm not trying to act like I'm a better builder, I'm just saying what I think would make it look better)
creations-chat 2022-05-09 01:15:47 k but I think 
the colors still seem a bit plain though, a lot of the more accepted builds have more shading of the colors on them to make them seem a bit less made of plastic
creations-chat 2022-05-09 01:17:37 he explained how it's powered by fuel instead of steam so it's not completely steam punk but I agree with parts of that

contest-chat 2022-06-08 22:12:37 If it starts with a j
contest-chat 2022-06-08 22:12:43 Then can we make a jaeger
contest-chat 2022-06-08 22:13:22 Most jaegers only have 1 or 2 golds
contest-chat 2022-06-08 22:13:25 Folds
contest-chat 2022-06-08 22:13:45 Nu
contest-chat 2022-06-08 22:14:00 Nuuuuuuu
contest-chat 2022-06-08 22:17:51 If an average one is around 80m tall and a character is let’s say 2 meters tall, then a normal block would be about 1m tall, so a normal jaeger to character scale would make the jade get around 80 blocks tall
contest-chat 2022-06-08 22:18:02 What
contest-chat 2022-06-08 22:18:55 2 blocks is about player height
contest-chat 2022-06-08 22:18:57 So how tall
contest-chat 2022-06-08 22:18:59 Is a character
contest-chat 2022-06-08 22:19:05 In those terms
contest-chat 2022-06-08 22:19:13 If a character had normal human height
contest-chat 2022-06-08 22:22:33 That would make a normal human
contest-chat 2022-06-08 22:22:38 Under 5 feet
contest-chat 2022-06-08 22:22:41 In that scale
contest-chat 2022-06-08 22:22:58 I mean
contest-chat 2022-06-08 22:23:03 If we make the character
contest-chat 2022-06-08 22:23:09 The size of a normal human
contest-chat 2022-06-08 22:23:12 Or around it
contest-chat 2022-06-08 22:26:27 What if we make then around 5.5 - 5.6 feet tall
contest-chat 2022-06-08 22:26:37 Then that around 96 blocks tall I think
contest-chat 2022-06-08 22:26:41 Or 94
contest-chat 2022-06-08 22:26:42 I forgot
contest-chat 2022-06-08 22:26:58 Uh
contest-chat 2022-06-08 22:27:05 There is really
contest-chat 2022-06-08 22:27:07 No way to tell
contest-chat 2022-06-08 22:27:17 Unless Roblox itself says how tall a stud is
contest-chat 2022-06-08 22:28:14 1 meter is 20 studs
contest-chat 2022-06-08 22:28:25 A stud is 5 cm
contest-chat 2022-06-08 22:28:38 Because
contest-chat 2022-06-08 22:28:40 This is a Lego game
contest-chat 2022-06-08 22:29:06 I just said that a stud is 5 cm
contest-chat 2022-06-08 22:29:19 And I never said that they didn’t say that
contest-chat 2022-06-08 22:29:24 I said unless they said that
contest-chat 2022-06-08 22:29:46 Anyways

contest-chat 2022-06-08 22:29:59 Unpro*
contest-chat 2022-06-08 22:30:13 Depends on how detailed it is
contest-chat 2022-06-08 22:30:32 If it’s just a flat map of blocks then yea
contest-chat 2022-06-08 22:30:43 But with more shapes then idk
creations-chat 2022-06-09 01:47:35 I think it’s a good idea to sit on the edge of the tip of the crane and eat lunch for an hour
creations-chat 2022-06-10 00:36:23 <@496779210728275969> you should motorlock delta wing panels into the edges to it is smooth rather than very blocky

creations-chat 2022-06-22 22:58:49 makes sense
creations-chat 2022-06-23 14:43:59 Hypocrite
creations-chat 2022-06-24 22:12:55 Dude just make your builds more likable to most pcc member by taking in some constructive criticism and suggestions if you want more upvotes. For example I think the colors are a bit too plain and some of the coloring doesn’t look that good on the diagonals, I suggest maybe locking some delta wings into the parts so it had more of a smooth edge.
creations-chat 2022-06-24 22:15:12 Plus the feedback of pcc and what they think of your builds doesn’t matter, it’s about how much you like it and how much you enjoy using and building it with maybe some friends to play with. Also don’t compare it to others because they build different and every person is different, some people like vans but not boats. Focus on what you want to do and not what other people think of you.(I don’t like the van either not much effort put in)
creations-chat 2022-06-24 22:17:31 (also are you actually in mech gang? I build mechs usually in plane crazy and might want to start a few in babft)
creations-chat 2022-06-24 22:19:56 I usually play in mech plane crazy servers but I’ve seen people playing babft and I kinda want to make some small to mid sized mechs there to see how fun they are.

creations-chat 2022-07-11 14:46:08 <@740718867344654436> I liked your old steam powered scrap mech and I think you should make the oni look a bit more armoured and more rounded with more shading, and maybe make the joints less exposed. It’s just smth that I think would help make your build style as every mech builder has a different one.
