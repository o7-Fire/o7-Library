creations-chat 2022-10-25 06:38:33 As I said in <#384025409945337856> This could get a redesign, so feel free to comment feedback to help fix the design, and for more info: It's a Torpedo Ram Class Iron Clad Battleship in 1890's England, and it was utilized to defend smaller steamships to escape England from Alien Fighting Machines.
creations-chat 2022-10-26 09:12:13 So... HMS Thunderchild... I might redesign mine lol... can someone tell me how to improve the design to make it more realistic/cool looking lol, (even though it's a fictional torpedo ram from an alien invasion novel, lol) Feedback would be great! and uhh... yeah...
creations-chat 2022-10-26 09:14:17 More photos of it are in <#384025409945337856> but you need to scroll up a fair bit.
bug-reports 2022-11-09 11:38:30 maybe roblox updated some of the websites code, which is causing the update loop maybe...?
