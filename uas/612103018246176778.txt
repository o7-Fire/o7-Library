creations-chat 2021-07-01 17:37:06 Black, If you ever want to be respected here, you have to put lots of effort into your builds, like my Arleigh burke class wihth 90+ upvotes, I didn't just build it in 10 minutes, in fact, it took me 3 **days**.
creations-chat 2021-07-01 17:39:37 <@!745689751805231160> Because they don't understand how low effort it is. People have gotten upset because easy builds like yours got more upvotes than their thing they spent so long on.
creations-chat 2021-07-01 17:43:03 Yes, But quality is not the same as effort, effort is how hard someone tried, which back then we usually tried our best, but quality is how good it is, building a good looking dolphin in 10 minutes is not effort.
creations-chat 2021-07-01 17:45:37 there isn't, it's around your builds. You, seem like a cool dude, but it makes people upset for low effort to be deemed as "high quality".

creations-chat 2021-08-08 00:38:20 Yes yes I see. I have reasoning on one thing, and others were just me being a dumbass. The reason the gun is so lacking of detail is mainly because the guns actually ***spin*** when I fire them. Also, I don't undestand what you mean by "more accurate?" To me I think the base looks fine, could you specify more?
creations-chat 2021-08-08 00:41:06 Well wait, specify what the Aiming thingy is? Is it the area around the gun's base? is it the guns huge forehead? is it the "infared cameras" on the side?
