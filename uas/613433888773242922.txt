plane-crazy 2020-07-22 09:15:09 Most of my builds don't really fall into the requirements for the roles
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 10:07:04 i'm sure some builds I have fit the criteria
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 10:06:57 Ah well, lemme get a rank
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 10:06:41 t r u t h
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 10:06:36 I mean, i'm no roleplayer

plane-crazy 2020-06-30 10:05:16 Kind off, not all servers have annoying players in them
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 10:05:02 > a lot of people play pvp <@!613433888773242922>  you just play passive mode since clearly your a roleplayer so you wouldn't know how toxic they really are.
<@!318291033626771457> What? I'm no roleplayer mate
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 10:04:48 I cant really be bothered but like
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 10:04:33 Well, maybe I'll try to get a rank
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 10:03:56 > but <@!613433888773242922> they are toxic scum of the game that made plane crazy go in a 600 player loss decline
<@!318291033626771457> No one plays that much PVP
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 10:03:15 bruh, this channel is just
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 10:01:16 not just for pvp
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 10:01:12 Well I dont want cutters to be removed because they are great for building
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 09:59:56 Yeah
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 09:59:47 Only 2
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 09:59:44 I've played PVP yesterday and the day before, 2 cutter builds
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 09:59:23 > <@!613433888773242922> you have been under a rock if you think so
<@!318291033626771457> No, you clearly have mate...
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 09:58:45 Bruh, cutter missiles arent that common
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 09:58:27 Yes
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 09:57:58 they still hit you
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 09:57:54 No, you cant avoid cutter spam
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 09:57:31 No it will not
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 09:57:01 Well yes but that is better than just not being able to fly
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 09:56:43 bruh, berg
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 09:56:37 I say remove blacklist for a while.
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 09:56:31 Well yes but it's not about rank
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 09:55:31 I could if I wanted
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 09:55:27 > unranked white names cringe
<@!325320982602448897> bruh, i'm just to lazy to get a rank
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 09:55:13 I mean, spawning at base works like 70% of the time

plane-crazy 2020-06-30 09:29:32 Everything seems to work fine!
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 09:29:12 Just dont add a votekick feature.
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 09:28:27 > make a vote kick feature to kick shredder bugs
<@!553344683938414596> It'd be abused to kick good players
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 09:27:27 Thanks, rickje
Let's hope it's fixed
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 09:26:10 Let's hope it works!

plane-crazy 2020-06-30 09:20:36 Spawn at airport, that works
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 09:19:45 Oh, it's still broken if you spawn a build
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 09:18:26 seems to be fixed!

plane-crazy 2020-06-30 09:12:12 > does Plane Crazy have a test game?
<@!528733203674955776> yes

plane-crazy 2020-06-30 09:11:08 wdym, did they shutdown again?
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 09:10:03 Paint seems to work fine
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 09:02:44 That should work, thanks dude
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 09:02:00 The build can go outside the base, just not the player
plane-crazy 2020-06-19 19:41:55 Yeah, looks good

plane-crazy 2020-05-01 17:22:20 Bruh
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 17:21:59 Speaker doesnt seem to be out yet
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 17:20:40 > rickje really just added a speaker
