help 2023-06-17 00:12:58 are yall aware of the system that makes it so you can fuse things together?, where you burn your limbs off get in somebody's seat and spawn in and they have said build, basically i made a dragon slayer sword that's incredibly strong but when your not in your seat cutters don't do damage, and since im in my friends seat in his gundam the sword can only fling people, should my friend make it so he is the one in MY seat or should i find a diffrent method, because when your limbless you cant get out of seats so i cant switch to my seat to deal damage, any idea's on how to make it work?
help 2023-06-17 00:45:36 great tip.
