plane-crazy 2020-06-29 22:41:24 perfect
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 22:40:44 do you have any STOL planes
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 22:40:34 i kinda wanna do a STOL competition
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 22:40:12 phat
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 22:31:09 another angle
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 22:29:50 p(p)
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 22:28:43 by STOL i kinda meant something like this
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 22:27:59 huh
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 22:25:14 competition
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 22:25:10 so y/n on STOL not VTOL
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 22:22:42 where you cannot use upwards facing thrust
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 22:22:32 i do a STOL competition
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 22:22:23 thats why
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 22:22:20 yea
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 22:20:28 do you think i should try and host an STOL competition
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 22:20:12 ive been doing some thinking
plane-crazy 2020-06-25 21:02:41 nice
plane-crazy 2020-06-21 00:39:19 dont tell the cops
plane-crazy 2020-06-21 00:38:56 dont <:FixPls:548709302282747914>

plane-crazy 2020-06-05 01:42:29 it would be really nice for landing
plane-crazy 2020-06-05 01:42:14 buttering the bread
plane-crazy 2020-06-05 01:41:58 and boom
plane-crazy 2020-06-05 01:41:56 and then subtract the ground height
plane-crazy 2020-06-05 01:41:45 it would just need to use your altitude
plane-crazy 2020-06-05 01:41:27 tells you how high off the gground you are
plane-crazy 2020-06-05 01:41:17 ground proximity warning system
plane-crazy 2020-06-05 01:40:52 who here thinks plane crazy needs gpws
plane-crazy 2020-05-28 02:00:43 da ba dee da ba die
plane-crazy 2020-05-27 20:42:39 and there's be map lists
plane-crazy 2020-05-27 20:42:30 where on vip server you could maybe load custom maps
plane-crazy 2020-05-27 20:42:14 what if a bigger map was another server type/vip server thing
plane-crazy 2020-05-27 20:41:46 hm
plane-crazy 2020-05-27 20:37:39 we got speakers
plane-crazy 2020-05-27 20:37:34 we asked for bigger map
