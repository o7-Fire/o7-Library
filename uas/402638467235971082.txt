bot-central 2021-05-28 06:45:57 &suggest Incendiary rounds for guns
PVP 
Players who have 1 day or more of playtime in the game get rewarded with the ability to use 50 rounds of each gun w/ incendiary rounds which don't penetrate blocks but rather set alight blocks near the area hit on an enemy build using the game's current fire mechanics. Longer guns will do more damage as opposed to smaller guns (ex: A block hit by a gun of 5 blocks or longer is destroyed completely and the fire spreads to more blocks farther out, being hit by a gun smaller than 2 blocks will only set on fire the block that is first hit).
