creations-chat 2019-11-27 23:29:58 ok it was cool at first but now you keep putting in pictures of your AC130 and its getting annoying
creations-chat 2019-11-27 23:42:00 yeah but we've already seen at least like 6 fucking pictures of it
creations-chat 2019-11-27 23:52:31 Y
creations-chat 2019-11-27 23:52:37 its my own design
creations-chat 2019-11-27 23:57:14 great genius, but super unstable
creations-chat 2019-11-28 00:03:35 and it has the most upvotes
creations-chat 2019-11-28 00:03:36 smh
creations-chat 2019-11-28 01:18:08 but if you put in a decal ID it comes out with the picture
creations-chat 2019-11-28 01:18:24 yeah
creations-chat 2019-11-28 01:21:53 well i made a shitty churchill
creations-chat 2019-11-28 01:22:01 some of the conveyors were wrong
creations-chat 2019-11-28 01:22:13 but that just made it bounce sometimes
creations-chat 2019-11-28 01:46:42 is it really?
creations-chat 2019-11-28 01:46:58 all it does is follow your mouse
creations-chat 2019-11-28 01:47:23 don't get me wrong, it's useful as fuck
creations-chat 2019-11-28 01:47:27 but is it op?
creations-chat 2019-11-28 01:52:14 <@!249666368411009025> 1. the inventor role cant be given to anyone anymore
2. its been made before
3. it's really not that useful
4.Too simple
creations-chat 2019-11-28 01:53:29 well by usefule i meant do something actually cool and original

creations-chat 2019-11-28 01:54:31 but nothing overkill
creations-chat 2019-11-28 01:54:59 except for maybe unscheduled space travel
creations-chat 2019-11-28 01:55:25 good point
creations-chat 2019-11-28 01:56:11 i will admit its way harder pressing all the keys than following with your mouse
creations-chat 2019-11-28 01:56:21 but motor2 is also unreliable to an extent
creations-chat 2019-11-28 01:56:48 sometimes when you aim up with it, the up/down motors go down until the side to side motors get to the target
creations-chat 2019-11-28 01:57:15 both

creations-chat 2019-12-01 20:55:27 or turn the torque to 1
creations-chat 2019-12-01 20:55:34 that worked for my fighter
creations-chat 2019-12-01 20:57:37 thats why you set the torque to 1, put power on, and speed to 50
creations-chat 2019-12-01 20:57:48 or maybe invert the controls

creations-chat 2019-12-31 01:07:48 there
creations-chat 2019-12-31 01:09:01 so the center of mass is slightly in front of the rotor
creations-chat 2019-12-31 01:09:07 so it moves forward
creations-chat 2019-12-31 01:10:00 and when the control surfaces go down, the forward motion pushes the rear of the heli upwards, making the rotor more angled, and making the heli go at a higher speed
creations-chat 2019-12-31 01:10:30 and vice versa
creations-chat 2019-12-31 01:12:04 just read it, i'm sure it'll make sense

creations-chat 2020-01-31 00:27:46 because it also balances it out, and it also lets you get a rank for it

the-dump 2020-10-06 14:17:37 I find it hilarious how you're being assholes for no obvious reason
the-dump 2020-10-06 14:18:48 > reason: anime cringe
invalid reason; please fuck off
the-dump 2020-10-06 14:19:00 nope :)
the-dump 2020-10-06 14:19:48 what
the-dump 2020-10-06 14:20:58 my unde readings are off the charts
the-dump 2020-10-06 14:21:44 says the person who is, in fact, not offended, but defending someone you're being an asshole to.
the-dump 2020-10-06 14:22:31 that is not from pyrocynical, just probably used in his video
the-dump 2020-10-06 14:22:54 What's the top ship?
the-dump 2020-10-06 14:23:00 Ik the bottom is a destroyer
the-dump 2020-10-06 14:23:21 cruiser?
the-dump 2020-10-06 14:23:45 there's another ship beating the shit out of a DD tho
the-dump 2020-10-06 14:24:08 carrier?
the-dump 2020-10-06 14:28:00 you know what's really cringe?
Two people who aren't even rank V in any area but are more critical than VipEmpire
over anime pfps of all things
the-dump 2020-10-06 14:28:38 that is all entirely your opinion
the-dump 2020-10-06 14:28:50 it's cringe that you think everyone should hold the same thoughts as you
the-dump 2020-10-06 14:30:16 > and it is cringe you argue about it while you just can keep your own opinion in your mind
Wow it's actually kinda funny
because I can say the exact same stupid thing back at you
the-dump 2020-10-06 14:32:06 https://youtu.be/krFvGL_EIZg
the-dump 2020-10-06 14:33:17 https://youtu.be/4eTdDAvqahI this video is the same exact thing, but a minute longer
the-dump 2020-10-06 14:34:13 then dont be sus lol
the-dump 2020-10-06 14:34:18 2 years
the-dump 2020-10-06 22:27:54 A bunch of memes: stonks
British Survivors of St quentin scar: *PTSD noises*
the-dump 2020-10-07 01:39:05 
the-dump 2020-10-07 04:38:39 <@!292484332042321921> can you do everyone and yourself a favor and stop spamming gifs?
the-dump 2020-10-07 04:38:42 thanks
the-dump 2020-10-07 04:39:15 I mean, I can ping obcpro if you'd like
the-dump 2020-10-07 04:39:32 spamming gifs
the-dump 2020-10-07 04:39:52 it still has the same exact rules
the-dump 2020-10-07 04:39:58 just a different theme
the-dump 2020-10-07 04:40:31 tsunami
the-dump 2020-10-07 04:40:37 it was spam
the-dump 2020-10-07 04:42:55 yeah that's gonna have to be a mega ♻️  from me dawg
the-dump 2020-10-07 04:44:01 I mean at least his excessive recycling of jokes is good for the environment
the-dump 2020-10-07 04:44:53 seen it
the-dump 2020-10-07 04:45:23 it's ok to share other people's jokes, but at least have the decency to make your own every now and again
the-dump 2020-10-07 04:46:13 jokes have no monetary value, so what would you be advertising?
the-dump 2020-10-07 04:46:16 the joke itself?
the-dump 2020-10-07 04:46:42 i've probably been here ten times longer than you have
the-dump 2020-10-07 04:47:36 Ah, and the spamming doesn't provoke a single thing?
the-dump 2020-10-07 04:48:44 i mean, there's still a rule that says "use common sense"
the-dump 2020-10-07 04:49:04 you are most certainly flooding the chat with recycled memes
the-dump 2020-10-07 04:49:42 thaaank you!
the-dump 2020-10-07 04:50:16 giv me mod so i can delet serevr
the-dump 2020-10-07 04:50:26 sure?
the-dump 2020-10-07 04:51:06 wait a minute
the-dump 2020-10-07 04:52:05 <@!292484332042321921> be like:
the-dump 2020-10-07 04:52:17 <@!615356321340063784> upvote if you agree
the-dump 2020-10-07 04:53:21 that's a uh
the-dump 2020-10-07 04:53:33 idk how far the rules go
the-dump 2020-10-07 04:53:41 but that definitely is a racist joke
the-dump 2020-10-07 04:53:48 not that i have a problem
the-dump 2020-10-07 04:53:54 I just don't know if they allowed
the-dump 2020-10-07 04:54:30 where did <#495286269459300364> go?
gone, reduced to shitty meme spam
the-dump 2020-10-07 04:55:08 it's a very obvious hint
the-dump 2020-10-07 04:55:36 i mean it feels like you think that only syria gets bombed by drones
the-dump 2020-10-07 04:55:43 you'd be right
the-dump 2020-10-07 04:56:57 ok it's been like 30 minutes and that's the first good meme you've posted
the-dump 2020-10-07 04:57:50 i mean the chat most certainly is dead
the-dump 2020-10-07 04:57:56 it's been replaced with shit memes
the-dump 2020-10-07 04:58:17 NEPAL
the-dump 2020-10-07 04:58:26 <@!714763671410180127> NEPAL
the-dump 2020-10-07 04:58:36 they are different fucking countries, i'll have you know
the-dump 2020-10-07 04:58:48 oh my fuck
the-dump 2020-10-07 04:58:53 there's not even any context
the-dump 2020-10-07 04:59:02 he's just posting meme formats without any jokes
the-dump 2020-10-07 04:59:39 I can hear the echoes of the tapping inside of your empty head
the-dump 2020-10-07 05:01:07 My ass wouldn't be miserable if the dump was deleted
the-dump 2020-10-07 05:02:42 > Live footage of <@!414778672847781888> when he gets banned and acts like he didn’t do anything
<@!725583147928125461> i've been banned once before. I've apologized, and haven't broken the rules since. i'm not breaking any rules now by being annoyed by a metric ton of 9 year old humor
the-dump 2020-10-07 05:03:10 you're breaking more rules than i am
the-dump 2020-10-07 05:03:54 i dislike the incredible spam
the-dump 2020-10-07 05:04:33 But i'd  like to see a meme that actually has a sliver of comedic value in all honesty
the-dump 2020-10-07 05:05:26 that's a suicide suggesting post
the-dump 2020-10-07 05:05:29 so uhh
the-dump 2020-10-07 05:05:30 yeah
the-dump 2020-10-07 05:05:35 probably should delete it
the-dump 2020-10-07 05:05:51 narrow's memes are by far the best in here
the-dump 2020-10-07 05:05:56 not to say they are that good
the-dump 2020-10-07 05:06:02 but they aren't shit
the-dump 2020-10-07 05:06:49 ima pass
the-dump 2020-10-07 05:07:11 i'm staring at the chat to see if a good meme comes up

the-dump 2020-10-07 05:10:05 woooah
the-dump 2020-10-07 05:10:23 he's actually being a helpful person instead of calling me an idiot
the-dump 2020-10-07 05:10:37 there are no mods right now
the-dump 2020-10-07 05:10:55 because this would've been stopped a long time ago
the-dump 2020-10-07 05:11:37 check this out: i'm gonna leave and you're still gonna call me an idiot
the-dump 2020-10-07 05:15:14 Hey guys check it out it's a meme i made by myself
the-dump 2020-10-07 05:16:14 and you could not tell
the-dump 2020-10-07 05:16:32 ahh there you go
the-dump 2020-10-07 05:16:41 even though i'm not even angry anymore
the-dump 2020-10-07 05:17:26 <@!347182144873037824> Name a field of study that you enjoy
the-dump 2020-10-07 05:17:30 I enjoy space.
the-dump 2020-10-07 05:17:35 I know many things about it
the-dump 2020-10-07 05:17:50 History? ok then
the-dump 2020-10-07 05:18:41 well obviously space is infinite, so i cant do that
the-dump 2020-10-07 05:25:18 R136a1 : the star with the most mass
Sagitarius A* : central black hole of our galaxy
Blazar : The brightest thing in the universe, which is ironically a black hole
Neutron star: closest density you can get to a black hole
Stephenson B(?) : largest star in existence
Oort cloud: the huge asteroid field that spans way further than the planets in the solar system
Sedna: a useless small sphere that orbits the sun
Pistol star: A blue hypergiant that ejects millions of tons of mass every second
the-dump 2020-10-07 05:25:28 I did not look this up. this is from my knowledge.
the-dump 2020-10-07 05:26:15 m

the-dump 2020-10-07 05:26:44 I find it kinda annoying how yall are still being assholes to me even long after ive stopped complaining
the-dump 2020-10-07 05:26:53 there it is
the-dump 2020-10-07 05:27:23 ahh and i come back civilized, and you start again
the-dump 2020-10-07 05:27:33 so i mean, what's your point?
the-dump 2020-10-07 05:27:59 obcpro99 is busy, but surely not that busy
the-dump 2020-10-07 05:28:44 I quite literally did for a while
the-dump 2020-10-07 05:28:51 I come back, without complaining
the-dump 2020-10-07 05:28:55 and here you are
the-dump 2020-10-07 05:29:44 from who? oh wait ik
the-dump 2020-10-07 05:30:35 Am i even provoking anything anymore?
the-dump 2020-10-07 05:31:08 Well that was my fault before, but is it really my fault now?
the-dump 2020-10-07 05:32:26 I mean, you can help it not be my problem by not calling me an idiot many times over (which is more stale than year old crackers)
the-dump 2020-10-07 05:33:01 > Your genuinely are being a idiot
this is big brain time
the-dump 2020-10-07 05:33:56 Oh hey guys check out this funny meme I made
the-dump 2020-10-07 05:34:24 exactly my problem
the-dump 2020-10-07 05:34:45 no matter what I do, you guys just have to be so incredibly rude
the-dump 2020-10-07 05:36:55 Hey i made a gun from garden warfare :)
the-dump 2020-10-07 05:37:22 <#495286269459300364> has no rules :)
the-dump 2020-10-07 05:38:20 you see me trying my best not to complain?
the-dump 2020-10-07 05:38:41 So you should understand, right?
the-dump 2020-10-07 05:38:56 What it feels like to be annoyed
the-dump 2020-10-07 05:39:44 i'm the only minority, that is true
the-dump 2020-10-07 05:40:43 here have an old destroyer that i made
the-dump 2020-10-07 05:41:23 what is annoying about posting a creation in the dump?
the-dump 2020-10-07 05:41:44 please do; i'd rather not be yelled at for existing
the-dump 2020-10-07 05:42:21 You see, you're allowed to post anything that falls within the rules here
the-dump 2020-10-07 05:42:35 so creations are allowed, and there is nothing you can do about it :)
the-dump 2020-10-07 05:43:12 Thank you
the-dump 2020-10-07 05:43:43 ahh yes, reassuring me that i'm an idiot. how thoughtful?
the-dump 2020-10-07 05:43:58 i thought you said you'd stop but you clearly didnt
the-dump 2020-10-07 05:44:43 have some planes i made
the-dump 2020-10-07 05:45:23 ignore what?
the-dump 2020-10-07 05:45:28 I want to be left alone
the-dump 2020-10-07 05:45:44 No thanks
the-dump 2020-10-07 05:46:30 well duh
the-dump 2020-10-07 05:46:48 I want to talk in this chat without everyone flaming me for being annoyed like a year ago
the-dump 2020-10-07 05:47:23 well of course, because, believe it or not, I have a reason to be.
the-dump 2020-10-07 05:48:29 I mean, you're giving it to me. it's not what I desire, but you think that's the case so you keep yelling at me
the-dump 2020-10-07 05:49:09 I am a person looking for happiness
the-dump 2020-10-07 05:49:46 yes
the-dump 2020-10-07 05:50:00 Exactly
the-dump 2020-10-07 05:50:10 oh for the love of god
the-dump 2020-10-07 05:50:33 I know what I want, and it's for you to just act like I don't exist
the-dump 2020-10-07 05:50:57 by saying "just ignore him" over and over again, you clearly aren't doing that
the-dump 2020-10-07 05:51:19 i'm not screaming at you
the-dump 2020-10-07 05:51:33 i'm not filling up the chat
the-dump 2020-10-07 05:51:51 I'm taking up about 20% of the space right now
the-dump 2020-10-07 05:52:03 then resume posting
the-dump 2020-10-07 05:53:21 I can ping obcpro right now and he would take unbiased action
the-dump 2020-10-07 05:53:50 most certainly not
the-dump 2020-10-07 05:54:02 He will see who is being less civilized, and punish them more
the-dump 2020-10-07 05:54:31 0balance
the-dump 2020-10-07 05:54:36 do yourself a favor
the-dump 2020-10-07 05:54:43 and continue enjoying the dump
the-dump 2020-10-07 05:55:27 time to stop talking and celebrate my leave with a random gif

the-dump 2020-10-08 23:02:12 the discord server still has rules that are **UNIVERSAL** across all channels that might not have the same rules, for example, you are not allowed to flood the chat *anywhere*. <@!512467907469377539>
