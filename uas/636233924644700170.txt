contest-chat 2022-09-08 19:15:04 No customs‚Ä¶. Welp there goes my f6f   Monstrosity
creations-chat 2022-09-13 20:01:19 how is my  ah-1 so far....  dont mind the rough edges, it will  eventually be smoothed out
creations-chat 2022-09-13 20:04:19 they shouldn't forget bout the bitz
creations-chat 2022-09-13 20:06:28 I haven't decided yet, but if it is gonna be a variant, its gonna be the 1s
creations-chat 2022-09-13 20:27:55 i don't really like the look of the 1z, I  think i might just stick to a normal AH-1
creations-chat 2022-09-13 23:06:54 im making it because i dont have much experience  with motor locked helicopters, so, im tyrin to challenge my self with something different, now I chose the AH-1s because its  the first heli my friend told me to build
creations-chat 2022-09-13 23:14:36 I am also  trying to use new tricks that i can use on other builds
creations-chat 2022-09-13 23:17:51 well, all of my lock is at the bottom, I though it would  make  it less top-heavy, ultimately making it more stable...  also, this a good length for the cockpit? (i aint gonna make it more smooth)
creations-chat 2022-09-13 23:20:08 is it that bad?
creations-chat 2022-09-13 23:40:33 its a heli, and if i made it clear, it would look  worse
creations-chat 2022-09-13 23:55:40 already tried clear, i dont like it
creations-chat 2022-09-14 01:50:25 Oh lord.... this is gonna be rough

creations-chat 2022-09-14 02:50:04 no, its "fr on bro" situation
creations-chat 2022-09-16 22:42:59 i think it might just be a little bit too long
