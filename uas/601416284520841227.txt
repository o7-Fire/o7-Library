The Tale of noob_17593649 (601416284520841227)
bug-reports 2021-04-03 12:09:55 i would like to report a wrong translation
bug-reports 2021-04-03 12:10:06 in the loading screen of plane crazy
bug-reports 2021-04-03 12:10:13 a green message appears
bug-reports 2021-04-03 12:10:52 "Like the game for more updates"
bug-reports 2021-04-03 12:11:05 but in the portuguese translated version it is:
bug-reports 2021-04-03 12:11:21 "Como o jogo para mais atualizaÃ§Ãµes"
bug-reports 2021-04-03 12:11:32 the thing is
bug-reports 2021-04-03 12:11:58 like translated to portguese can have 2 meanings
bug-reports 2021-04-03 12:12:03 one is the
bug-reports 2021-04-03 12:12:30 Like (as in comparison)  translated it would be "como"
bug-reports 2021-04-03 12:12:33 and
bug-reports 2021-04-03 12:12:58 Like (as in liking, enjoying)  translated it would be "gostar"
bug-reports 2021-04-03 12:13:14 so the green text should say
bug-reports 2021-04-03 12:13:27 "Goste do jogo para mais atualizaÃ§Ãµes"
bug-reports 2021-04-03 12:46:43 So..
bug-reports 2021-04-03 12:46:50 i found more wrong translation
bug-reports 2021-04-03 12:46:55 way more wrong translation
bug-reports 2021-04-03 12:47:05 they are everywhere
bug-reports 2021-04-03 12:48:53 i can't put them all here
bug-reports 2021-04-03 12:48:56 they are so many
bug-reports 2021-04-03 12:49:01 but from what i found
bug-reports 2021-04-03 12:49:09 "Beam" translation is wrong
bug-reports 2021-04-03 12:49:20 "Block" translation is wrong in some cases
bug-reports 2021-04-03 12:51:33 "Magnet" translation only supports 1 portuguese type (yes there are many portuguese languages, you have portuguese from Portugal, you have PALOP portuguese, you have portuguese from Brazil, you have portuguese from Asia, and portuguese from Timor)
bug-reports 2021-04-03 12:52:13 "Conveyor" translation is also wrong but you can sort of understand what it means
bug-reports 2021-04-03 12:52:46 "landing gear" translation is also wrong
bug-reports 2021-04-03 12:53:11 "Spring" translation is super wrong
bug-reports 2021-04-03 12:53:37 "Horn" translation is also wrong
bug-reports 2021-04-03 12:53:58 "Trap door" translation is wrong
bug-reports 2021-04-03 12:56:11 "Half Block" translation is wrong but only on the gender of the words (yes in portuguese you have feminine words and male words ex: o Bloco - male word (the Block)  / a Mola - feminine word (the Spring)
bug-reports 2021-04-03 12:56:46 "Half wedge" Translations are wrong in some cases
bug-reports 2021-04-03 12:58:13 some translations of the Light blocks have also the wrong gender and Spotlight isn't translated  (Spotlight = Holofote )
bug-reports 2021-04-03 12:59:22 Some translations of the stairs block are wrong (it sounds like a GPS  Vire Ã  esquerda = turn left , what you want is more like "Viragem Ã  esquerda" or "Curvo para a esquerda")
bug-reports 2021-04-03 13:02:32 then we have the translations in the settings of a functional part
bug-reports 2021-04-03 13:03:11 and from what i saw they don't look that good
bug-reports 2021-04-03 13:03:37 just found another
bug-reports 2021-04-03 13:04:32 "Sign" translation is wrong  (it is translated to "assinar" as in signing papers where it should be "sinal")
bug-reports 2021-04-03 13:23:00 so are you saying that roblox is the one that converts the text to the translations in all GUIs of the game?
bug-reports 2021-04-03 13:23:11 man
bug-reports 2021-04-03 13:23:15 they suck at it
bug-reports 2021-04-03 13:23:28 it's literally the worst translation ever
bug-reports 2021-04-03 13:24:41 can't plane crazy remove the roblox translation or make a custom that is correct?
bug-reports 2021-04-03 13:25:23 because with that type of translation
bug-reports 2021-04-03 13:25:29 it's best to not have translation at all
bug-reports 2021-04-03 13:36:30 well
bug-reports 2021-04-03 13:36:35 as you can see above
bug-reports 2021-04-03 13:36:44 if he needs help with the portuguese translation
bug-reports 2021-04-03 13:36:52 i would happily provide it
bug-reports 2021-04-03 13:56:39 i don't know if anybody else has posted this bug but
bug-reports 2021-04-03 13:56:47 sometimes when i open my parachute
bug-reports 2021-04-03 14:00:41 My parachute starts moving from side to side and projects me with 140000000+ Speed so i watch my avatar slowly become more pixalized until ultimatly it is reduced to nothing or i somehow hit the barrier of the environment space and die
bug-reports 2021-04-03 14:01:43 but i don't know if there are different types
bug-reports 2021-04-03 14:02:03 i don't know if everyone's avatar gets reduced to pixels
bug-reports 2021-04-03 14:03:33 but didn't you saw my question?
bug-reports 2021-04-03 14:03:49 i don't know if everyone's avatar get's reduced to pixels
bug-reports 2021-04-03 14:03:59 the pinned only says flinged
bug-reports 2021-04-03 14:04:31 and everyone reaches 14000000+ speeds?
bug-reports 2021-04-03 14:05:07 never happend to me in other games
bug-reports 2021-04-03 14:05:12 i'll look for it
bug-reports 2021-04-03 14:07:35 oh
bug-reports 2021-04-03 14:07:39 that explains alot
bug-reports 2021-04-03 14:11:31 yes
bug-reports 2021-04-03 14:12:24 however if one happens without the other it would imply that there are in fact multiple type of the bug, but since this is not the case, no need to worry

creations-chat 2021-04-12 19:43:28 nobody here can confirm it since we weren't there
creations-chat 2021-04-12 19:45:33 so with more than a century since the accident and if you claim to be on  a sub you needed to me in your early adult age to be able to crew it so you are saying you are 120+ years old?
creations-chat 2021-04-12 19:47:35 why this chonnel haeb cooldown

congratulations kokamzy you are one of the oldest if not the oldest person in the world, one question, why do you spend your final days in a discord server of a game in a platform intended for children?
