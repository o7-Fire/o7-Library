plane-crazy 2020-03-02 16:26:21 It's "Network receive" that's throttling my fps.
plane-crazy 2020-03-02 16:25:35 in terms of fps
plane-crazy 2020-03-02 16:25:24 Decreasing graphics does nothing
plane-crazy 2020-03-02 16:19:32 I guess I'll have to live with my planes flying in slowmotion

plane-crazy 2020-03-02 16:18:24 So it's not that
plane-crazy 2020-03-02 16:18:19 Well roblox only uses like at most 10% cpu and 15% gpu

plane-crazy 2020-01-21 23:22:02 Hey we need heat seeking motor 2s.
plane-crazy 2020-01-21 22:22:58 Locked motors do wonders when trying to create a portal to the void through which you can instantly transport matter.
plane-crazy 2019-12-11 19:58:19 I thought that was how u got ranks.....
plane-crazy 2019-12-11 19:57:56 Has my life been a lie?
plane-crazy 2019-12-11 19:57:06 So uh... About does rules of that one challenge I asked about a few minutes ago.....
plane-crazy 2019-12-11 19:53:37 You guys know that 600 block 1 propeller 200 speed challenge thing? What are the actual rules on that about using motors and stuff?
plane-crazy 2019-12-11 19:44:34 oof
plane-crazy 2019-12-11 19:37:46 <@386974424538152960> oh really?
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 13:39:42 They add mouse controlled motors but don't let you make moving winglets that control the same as the control surfaces
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 13:38:41 Is there a way to make the motor 2 just follow where on your screen your mouse is and not what you're pointing at?
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 13:37:36 time to add mouse control to the all-moving canards
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 13:37:14 well

plane-crazy 2019-08-28 16:04:59 For the crazy engineer thing, do you need to use the propeller block or can you make your own propeller with a motor and propeller blades?
