bug-reports 2022-06-19 23:56:19 There is a bug that is happening to me and that is that every time I make an airplane the control panels bulge and begin to wobble
bug-reports 2022-06-19 23:56:52 That is, the control panels move like crazy
bug-reports 2022-06-20 00:42:43 You are wrong, it is not the plane, since you accelerated the plane from the runway begins to move the controller
