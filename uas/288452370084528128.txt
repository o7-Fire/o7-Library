bug-reports 2021-06-14 15:22:08 its not a bug if u have to rebalance ur ship and if it was working u either have faulty memory or roblox updated
bug-reports 2021-06-14 15:33:00 probably a roblox update ur just gonna have to roll with it and keep trying buddy
bug-reports 2021-06-14 15:33:21 i know ur pain a roblox update messed up my 12k block ship and i had to rebalance for a few hours to get it working
bug-reports 2021-06-14 15:33:49 wert man how wide is ur ship and how long is it

creations-chat 2021-07-24 02:32:35 did u make the mech of the past?
bug-reports 2021-07-31 03:20:46 This bug always happens to me when i try to load a build that is above 11k blocks, but usually i can just go into a private server and spawn the build fine. However with my newest build of 14k blocks, it does not matter how many different private servers or public servers i try to spawn my build into, it just does not work. Basically what happens is when i try to spawn the build, the build will teleport to the water (where i want to spawn it), and will just sit there while i won't be teleported. Along with this, my altitude and speed gauges will be permanently broken and i can't do anything until i reset.
bug-reports 2021-07-31 03:22:17 here is the f9 menu
bug-reports 2021-07-31 03:24:31 also what makes this actually bad is that my build sits useless in the air and will not correctly spawn meaning it cant actually move or do anything

bug-reports 2023-07-07 20:53:22 this issue has happened to me forever, figured something might have changed with the new update, but oh well. whenever i try to load a large build anywhere other than the spawn area this error that says 'exhausted allowed execution time' always occurs and the build will basically just sit in place and be completely unusable, i have to reset my character in order to fix the game
bug-reports 2023-07-08 19:39:06 my user id is 51108706, the build in question is in slot 20, named 'New Laker', 15,598 blocks
bug-reports 2023-07-08 19:41:37 also another issue i have found is disconnectors causing huge ping spikes, basically if you have say a few hundred disconnectors all set to the same keybind, when u press the bind they will slowly disconnect one by one and you will have like 300k ping and the game is completely frozen until they all disconnect
bug-reports 2023-07-12 01:30:07 yes, here is the f9 screen, the build can be seen on the water, my character is not teleported and the build is useless. I wonder if something with disconnectors? although this doesn't happen on my other disconnector-heavy builds
bug-reports 2023-07-12 16:49:10 okay, my username is depuitypoop. user id 51108706. The slot that I used in the screenshot is slot 20, named 'New Laker'. This glitch has always existed since I've played Plane crazy, however after the recent update only affects this one build. Basically, when I try to spawn the build in slot 20 on the water or airport, it will be stuck in the air and my character will not be teleported. If I try to go over to the build and sit in the pilot seat, the controls do nothing and the build just sits there. This used to happen occasionally with a few of my other large builds, however happens consistently every time I try to load slot 20 on the water or airport instead of the base spawn area.
bug-reports 2023-07-12 16:49:45 happens in both public and private server
bug-reports 2023-07-12 16:50:32 and this build doesn't contain pistons, only locked motors and disconnectors, although I have another build with almost 900 disconnectors which can spawn on the water just fine
bug-reports 2023-07-12 16:55:13 load slot 20, click 'water' in the settings menu, click the spawn build button, and the glitch happens
