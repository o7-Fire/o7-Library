The Tale of tailedkitsune09 (619312093962829849)
help 2021-08-11 19:17:41 are the materials just for looks or do they add weight and durability to a block?
help 2021-08-11 19:50:10 thanks
help 2021-08-11 20:03:35 a bit of a subjective question, but what's considered a "good" build here? I don't do camera or motor locks so I can't build anything complex
help 2021-08-12 00:15:52 i think he means boathouse
creations-chat 2021-08-12 01:07:30 what if he put a lava spitter on the fire truck?
creations-chat 2021-08-12 01:12:55 one of the variants appears to have a rotary cannon turret on the underside
creations-chat 2021-08-12 01:17:59 > <@580878305486569474> 
Not sure on that, also guns are attached above hardpoints for rocket pods (see images for reference)
> <@456226577798135808> 
Just emphasizing the "fire" in fire truck. I know what you mean, my humor is shit.

creations-chat 2021-08-12 23:52:23 damn, who pissed in 'yall cups today?
Also, feedback for improvements?
creations-chat 2021-08-12 23:54:31 I mean it can't go off-road. It can move off the plot (lemme edit that)
creations-chat 2021-08-12 23:56:58 More circles. Noted.
creations-chat 2021-08-13 00:00:39 bestow upon it a comically large gun
add wings on it and make it flyable
creations-chat 2021-08-13 00:03:18 actual suggestion: try giving it a camo paint job?
creations-chat 2021-08-13 00:08:10 yep, looks good. Good luck

creations-chat 2021-08-13 00:34:44 how many upvotes do y'all think I can get with a single block?
creations-chat 2021-08-13 00:42:20 üëç
np
creations-chat 2021-08-13 00:44:59 ...should we move this to <#497142796961054721> ?
creations-chat 2021-08-13 02:24:37 *cough cough* wall e *cough cough*
yeah just referring to the shitshow that one caused
creations-chat 2021-08-13 02:28:04 I kinda feel a bit egotistical asking this but would my tank be in the "meh" or "okay" zone?

also <@723940197456281640> I was talking about the whole argument that ensued after the wall e didn't get into hof
creations-chat 2021-08-13 02:32:55 lmao some people think it looks like a siege tank. I don't even know sc2
creations-chat 2021-08-13 02:35:35 I'll see what I can do. can't guarantee perfect results tho, this was heavily retrofitted from one of my first builds
creations-chat 2021-08-13 12:49:56 now the motorlocks are even more exposed in the front. You could've tried to hide it with a paint job y'know
creations-chat 2021-08-13 12:54:14 cant say much with that shitty pic quality. maybe try adding some round windows on the sides
creations-chat 2021-08-13 12:56:35 overall just more detail, like extending the engines so they dont look like blocks attatched to a motor and wings, turrets on the back of the wings, etc.
Look at images of the plane to see what I mean
creations-chat 2021-08-13 12:59:42 ...thats literally what I just said

fine >:I
creations-chat 2021-08-13 13:03:02 can't complain bout that
help 2021-08-13 13:06:58 How can I get more stable flight in high speeds without motorlocking?
help 2021-08-13 16:51:02 gotta get level 3 rank to post images here. type !rank in <#384027830192832513> to see your rank
help 2021-08-13 16:52:09 either way I wouldn't recommend posting anything too mainstream such as a10s or whatnot in <#384025409945337856> unless it's really well done.
help 2021-08-13 16:52:18 people are a little judgy here
creations-chat 2021-08-13 17:36:33 sure. Also please give it a paint job it hurts my eyes to look at it
creations-chat 2021-08-13 17:53:05 Okay, any suggestions? I can't make custom landing gears due to space constraint
Bottom is pvp version with different paint scheme and hatch closed
creations-chat 2021-08-13 17:55:28 Btw, these aren't based off any irl planes. All custom built.
creations-chat 2021-08-13 18:07:48 üò¢
creations-chat 2021-08-13 18:40:59 thats... why I asked for suggestions
creations-chat 2021-08-13 19:03:51 i made it as smooth as I can. Limited half blocks means the nose stays like that. Any more feedback?
creations-chat 2021-08-13 19:10:11 custom jet. no irl base. Actually, fuck it. I just redid the nose
creations-chat 2021-08-13 19:17:01 I can fix the elevators, working on the canopy right now, but I can't do much about the nose. What do you think about improving the nose
creations-chat 2021-08-13 19:49:09 Alright, I reworked the canopy (seat is horizontal b/c it won't fit), redid the elevator, and reworked the nose. How is it now?
creations-chat 2021-08-13 19:52:50 wait, lemme just make the nose a bit more **THICC**
creations-chat 2021-08-13 20:12:49 color, texture, maybe put some ladders around the top to make it look like fencing
creations-chat 2021-08-13 20:34:23 okay, any more feedback on what could be done? If you need more pics I'll provide
creations-chat 2021-08-13 21:07:05 seat isn't  motorlocked 0/10
creations-chat 2021-08-13 23:16:33 Any feedback before I put this in creations to be downvoted to death?
creations-chat 2021-08-14 00:35:07 Thoughts on this before I upload it to creation? Custom jet
creations-chat 2021-08-14 00:37:41 wish me luck
creations-chat 2021-08-14 00:45:02 Oi, what do you want me to do; shove a shitload of motorlocks up it's intake, make it jumbo jet sized, and give it the ability to transform into a fucking robot? At least give some feedback instead of saying that it's a beginner plane

p.s. I can't do any of that

Boi this is like the fifth time I changed the nose
creations-chat 2021-08-14 01:06:45 I've gave this plane so many nose jobs that I might as well take up a job in plastic surgery. How bad is it now?
creations-chat 2021-08-14 01:12:41 Compared to the previous nose, comparable or worse? (I'm not keeping this nose anyways looks like shit)
creations-chat 2021-08-14 01:14:49 yeah I figured that's the shit part. I 'll see what I can do
creations-chat 2021-08-14 01:26:42 Best I can do with the nose. It's nearly 10:30 pm, I'm tired and out of ideas, and this is a horrible attempt at blending the nose and body together. Just kill me already
creations-chat 2021-08-14 01:29:25 please... no more nose... I want to shower and sleep... I've already taken multiple suggestions and all of them was the nose... no more...
creations-chat 2021-08-14 01:35:59 not my art, but me right now.
creations-chat 2021-08-14 01:56:42 north america. yep
creations-chat 2021-08-14 02:01:58 anything else I should change on the jet tomorrow ***besides the goddamn nose***?

very funny alxti96
creations-chat 2021-08-14 02:09:42 well I'm sorry I can't turn my "beginner noob" custom jet into a perfectly recreated motor locked russian jet for you. I guess I should just give up and step aside for you elitists because I can't build for jack shit without looking up some tutorial on youtube. I'm trying for fucks sake.
creations-chat 2021-08-14 02:12:33 sorry, just had to vent a little
creations-chat 2021-08-14 03:06:14 it is custom. Actually, it first started off as a bad attempt at a boeing "Loyal Wingman" and moved from there to the custom jet you see now.

I even attempted a forward swept version and it ended up being a su47 so I deleted it
creations-chat 2021-08-14 03:08:35 I have a habit of accidentally making things resembling things I don't intend it to be lol
creations-chat 2021-08-14 12:46:02 AAAAAAAAAA
creations-chat 2021-08-14 12:49:38 got it, thanks (how can I make the wings flush? I get that using half wedges can help, but a good chunk of it is control surfaces so I don't want to fix it in place

...... I'll redo the wings.
creations-chat 2021-08-14 12:52:42 everyone's complaining about the thicc nose, should I just give up and replace the nose with a long stick made with trails instead? (this is a joke)
creations-chat 2021-08-14 12:55:25 btw, I can't easily move the canopy up because I won't have room for the canopy motor, do you think shortening the nose by a block would help?
creations-chat 2021-08-14 12:59:39 after so many requests and complaints about the thicc nose, I think I've finally thinned it down enough. How's this?
creations-chat 2021-08-14 13:01:43 I HAVE ACHIEVED ENLIGHTENMENT. THE PLANE SHALL NOW *A S C E N D*

creations-chat 2021-09-25 22:49:19 What about this? I extended it by one block since I personally don't like the longer 2x1 one up there
creations-chat 2021-09-25 22:59:40 Should I make the canards bigger?
creations-chat 2021-09-25 23:15:41 the front small wings on the nose.
creations-chat 2021-09-25 23:22:15 The jet is custom. I'm just tweaking the wings so they look more proportionate
creations-chat 2021-09-25 23:25:02 Canards are bigger. Feedback?
creations-chat 2021-09-25 23:28:34 
creations-chat 2021-09-25 23:31:16 and it actually helped with balancing the lift as well. I don't need the helium blocks to level it anymore. Thanks <@!467459282250629120>
creations-chat 2021-09-25 23:35:36 ?
creations-chat 2021-09-25 23:38:20 How about this? <@!467459282250629120>
creations-chat 2021-09-26 01:11:07 I was trying not to make a copy of any other wings from other aircraft (especially the f22 and f35). Admittedly i did switch back to the original canards (abeit thicker and longer) to retain consistency.

<@792842138999980034> Oh it was nothing, just greyscaled the colors and adjusted the patterns a little
ye it looks more formal
creations-chat 2021-09-26 01:22:28 <@456226577798135808> 95% of the effort went to motorlocking that nose and the other 5% went to the plane. I'm already being quite generous with the 5%
creations-chat 2021-09-26 01:28:32 I also put functionality first in all of my builds, but in creations, it's basically always looks over functionality. As a designer IV you should know that.
creations-chat 2021-09-26 01:32:59 yeah I agree. But strong's mig didn't even look like any effort was put in. As he said, it was only made in half a hour. He did say it was for pvp though so i can see why (still, a nose like that is kinda unnecessary for pvp dontcha think?)
creations-chat 2021-09-26 01:39:22 oh, okay.

creations-chat 2021-09-30 15:53:50 I see your reason, but think about it. Are you really building to appease the masses or are you building for your own enjoyment? If the latter's the case, a few downvoted builds shouldn't be enough to drag you down

"The ‚Äútsun‚Äù in tsundere comes from the Japanese word ‚Äútsuntsun‚Äù („ÉÑ„É≥„ÉÑ„É≥) which means¬†to be aloof or high and mighty. Thus, tsunderes are often stuck-up on the outside but loving on the inside."

creations-chat 2021-10-21 02:54:45 good tank, but the chassis is too rectangular
creations-chat 2021-10-21 02:56:52 you could angle the back more with wedges. The front looks relatively fine. It may just be the railings making it look rectangular so its probably negligible
creations-chat 2021-10-21 02:59:51 <@456226577798135808> it looks like you took a plane and removed the back and the wings. No, really, those wings look too small and the canopy is too disproportionate

creations-chat 2021-10-23 20:55:18 I slightly changed the wing shape. How is it now?
Don't answer it looks shit
creations-chat 2021-10-23 20:57:45 it is. can reach +1000 with hover engines alone. Though maneuvering and stability is still wip
creations-chat 2021-10-23 21:02:10 I can't fully blend them in, it's basically impossible because each surface has a motor rather than two motors driving a big surface
creations-chat 2021-10-23 21:04:43 I'll try, I've never motorlocked this many wings before. Actually, this is my first motorlocked build

creations-chat 2021-10-26 00:19:21 The canard is the only motorlocked thing in the build. I'm not experienced enough to use it and anglelocking properly on the fuselage and I rely on preexisting wedges (which by itself is limited).

creations-chat 2021-11-05 00:10:54 1. going in this specific order: A10, F14 intake and wing, X-02 wing, F4 exhaust
2. this, but shittier
creations-chat 2021-11-05 00:14:34 1. why not?
2. Started off as a cursed project so I initially chose tutorial components for a good bit of the airframe for faster construction; particularly the a10/f14 aspect of the plane.
3. refer to number 1
creations-chat 2021-11-05 00:17:05 yeah, I dunno how I ended with this. I was aiming for the epitome of cursed a10s but somehow ended up with a somewhat okay-ish and functional jet??? I probably will polish it and remove the vulpen front later

okay...
creations-chat 2021-11-19 02:24:14 not even going to give any suggestions?

Oh yes, I forgot this was <#504436696021204992>. you can't get actual suggestions for improvement.
creations-chat 2021-11-19 02:26:54 I assume you're going to say it's too fat. To which I will say: "there's nothing I can do about that. I'm not making a mini build."
creations-chat 2021-11-19 02:37:09 <@707953054489509978> The <#384025409945337856> version will not have those. Ik.

<@799381636407099483> Both of which require more motorlock and complex anglelock. Given the current design and my skill level that is impossible to do without reworking a massive swath of the airframe

I am already pushing the canards. This is as far back as they can go atm

They weren't added for looks. I literally needed them to properly fly the aircraft
creations-chat 2021-11-19 02:43:46 it's for stability. most of the lift is at the back of the plane and I'm not using helium to compensate. I'll explain more in the <#384025409945337856> post. In short, the airframe is very unstable
creations-chat 2021-11-19 02:45:52 I can probably experiment without canards but it'll likely result in a lot of shaking and worse pitch rate
creations-chat 2021-11-19 14:31:37 (I can't tell if you're trolling me) I cannot and will not anglelock the nose. 

I presume you wouldn't find a pyramid wedge good, nor will I since the nose is 2 blocks thick, not the usual 3 so adding that will be a pain.
creations-chat 2021-11-19 14:34:53 1x4 triangle instead of 1x3? this is what the front looks like. Yes, I know; I will remove the motor
creations-chat 2021-11-19 14:43:48 Ill try. there's a prop in there so I'm not sure how that'll affect handling

<@489371955158450176> Metal texture would just make it slow or probably unflyable. The plane shakes a lot with default
creations-chat 2021-11-19 14:46:21 oh well, noted for <#384025409945337856> display model
creations-chat 2021-11-19 15:55:09 <@!404632014189494293> Used the 1x4 wedges along with some minor changes. how's it now?

It's starting to be uncomfortably close to the xfa 27...
creations-chat 2021-11-19 15:59:56 1x3 glass wedge for the front?
creations-chat 2021-11-19 16:02:09 
creations-chat 2021-11-19 16:04:10 the glass wedge?

the glass wedge or the block?

creations-chat 2021-11-19 17:04:04 metal is heavier and has darker colors (because of this the metal ver. will not have fly-by pics, and the plastic one may not either)

plastic can fly, but it'll be too unstable for practical use. metal is untested which is why metal and plastic will be display models. the official one will be ice.
creations-chat 2021-11-19 17:08:28 ~~f22~~ It's custom
creations-chat 2021-11-19 17:10:55 it actually flies
creations-chat 2021-11-19 17:14:54 I refuse to motorlock further. I'll find a way
creations-chat 2021-11-19 17:18:16 you're right it doesn't. the only motorlocked things are the cockpit, top intake covers, and the signs on the back, all of which (except for top intake covers) were retrofitted on in the last iteration.
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/756900018602115152/911304795053256764/unknown.png
creations-chat 2021-11-19 17:22:56 yeah but the complexity and effort needed to rebuild this entire plane with motorlocks rn is too much for me
I'm still working out problems with stability
creations-chat 2021-11-19 17:25:33 absolutely not. I will not delete this jet just because it wasn't built with motorlocks
creations-chat 2021-11-19 17:31:21 are you saying there's problems with the paintjob or the lack of motorlock? Because I can fix one of those.
creations-chat 2021-11-19 17:35:23 removed some of the lighter spots, anything else?
creations-chat 2021-11-19 17:38:41 Any more suggestions for improving paintjob?
creations-chat 2021-11-19 17:42:20 it's a custom plane, and I've been working on changing the shape for several months already. It's tricky to find what parts would be good on your plane while having a aspect of originality y'know.
the lack of half wedge parts doesn't help either
creations-chat 2021-11-19 17:45:02 I've already looked at pictures of the f14, f22, f35, macross planes, cfa44, SU aircraft, and (unintentionally) the xfa 27, along with advice from various pcc members. How much more variety do you want?

<@!721103577380159490> those are downvotes
creations-chat 2021-11-19 17:47:10 I still question what part of this looks like a raptor

creations-chat 2021-11-19 17:55:17 they look nothing like the ones on the f22, are you trolling me or being serious?
creations-chat 2021-11-19 18:00:39 so theoretically I could make something that doesn't work at all and I get upvotes if it looks good??

events-chat 2022-01-27 05:43:23 oh come on that's too restrictive. Can't it at least be ww2?
events-chat 2022-01-27 05:43:39 barely

events-chat 2022-01-27 05:45:12 how about a max speed cap
events-chat 2022-01-27 05:45:49 it is possible to motorlock engines, thus negating the engine restrictions. A maximum speed restriction may solve the issue
events-chat 2022-01-27 05:46:28 ehhhh 700-900ish
events-chat 2022-01-27 05:46:45 maybe lower
events-chat 2022-01-27 05:47:12 I'd be impressed if soneone can make a 1 speed plane fly
events-chat 2022-01-27 05:47:58 speed boosts are easy to spot anyways no? just see if they're going faster than usual
events-chat 2022-01-27 05:49:00 thats why I suggested the speed cap. you could ban all engines except for rockets and people would still motorlock them in
events-chat 2022-01-27 05:50:08 besides, if you can hide a speed booster what's keeping you from hiding banned blocks?

events-chat 2022-01-30 13:51:16 The tutorial plane is a 5x5 space so it's possible to it lol
events-chat 2022-01-31 00:45:19 so is the maximum speed 350 now? and 1 rocket only with no fireworks? (8 guns still)?
events-chat 2022-01-31 00:46:18 oh boy. aight
events-chat 2022-01-31 01:37:01 My plane goes at 366 in a straight line but it takes the entire map to get to that speed. is it still valid?
events-chat 2022-01-31 01:39:50 it must look like a plane.
events-chat 2022-01-31 01:42:01 he doesn't need to. he was the one that came up with the event idea
events-chat 2022-01-31 01:42:52 ask rbk idk
events-chat 2022-01-31 01:47:53 Imma gonna try and see if I can restore vtol functionality to my nerfed event build
events-chat 2022-01-31 02:56:49 isn't tnt banned?
events-chat 2022-01-31 02:58:05 üóø
events-chat 2022-01-31 02:59:01 I'm gonna work on restoring vtol functionality and snipe from a distance
events-chat 2022-01-31 02:59:30 gonna have to pull some more witchcraft to make vtol without super rockets
events-chat 2022-01-31 03:04:47 fun and games until gjsolo arrives and decimates everyone
events-chat 2022-01-31 03:05:26 until rbk hits the wrong key and sets off all the explosives
events-chat 2022-01-31 03:10:37 I have a a-10 f-14 x-02 hybrid
events-chat 2022-01-31 03:13:05 if i joined red team all I need to do is restore pixy livery lol <:itstime:800364383829884950>
events-chat 2022-01-31 03:13:47 his plane is gonna get mistaken for bomber and be nuked
events-chat 2022-01-31 03:14:09 <@!466793357318815744> can we use speakers?
events-chat 2022-01-31 03:14:50 lmao forget guns or rockets sonic weapons are the future
events-chat 2022-01-31 03:15:17 you clearly haven't seen my plane handle <:OkayChamp:709084018485887096>

events-chat 2022-01-31 03:17:00 dragon fighter 2? <:OmegaTroll:626841385118597152>
events-chat 2022-01-31 03:18:14 so dragon fighter on steroids
events-chat 2022-01-31 03:19:56 cameras and motor
events-chat 2022-01-31 03:20:53 https://streamable.com/3uertq
events-chat 2022-01-31 03:21:21 that would be hard to set up
events-chat 2022-01-31 03:21:49 this is my daily-driver. the one you see submitted is nerfed.
events-chat 2022-01-31 03:23:10 lmao i ran some tests, should be relatively okay although i did have to sacrifice a feature or two to make things legal.
events-chat 2022-01-31 03:23:55 the handling is mostly unchanged outside of some pitch issue
events-chat 2022-01-31 03:25:37 show the results later I'm curious
events-chat 2022-01-31 03:27:03 imagine needing gravity slider to fly <:trollface:775024642104229898>
events-chat 2022-01-31 03:29:10 no it's possible with regular engines
events-chat 2022-01-31 03:29:35 i did it once way back, though i needed some simple thrust vectoring to stay stable
events-chat 2022-01-31 03:31:05 oh boy i expected that
events-chat 2022-01-31 03:33:20 psms would be easier to perform
events-chat 2022-01-31 03:35:28 i just realized my plane can drift and has the initial d ae-86 paintjob. I just need a speaker and some eurobeat now
events-chat 2022-01-31 03:36:24 hmmmmm.....  <:MarisaThinking:856279671054270534>
events-chat 2022-01-31 03:37:03 I know some flowering night (night of nights) eurobeat mixes
events-chat 2022-01-31 03:37:39 also night of nights is a touhou song, just a heads up
events-chat 2022-01-31 03:37:59 no but eurobeat remixes exist. A LOT in fact
events-chat 2022-01-31 03:40:04 what if the intruder is spy?
the-dump 2022-01-31 03:42:40 try bing.
events-chat 2022-01-31 12:23:46 I used 6 hover engines. can not confirm its op.
events-chat 2022-01-31 12:24:40 not to mention hover engines have horrible acceleration and has a massive speed penalty on turns
events-chat 2022-01-31 12:25:12 same
events-chat 2022-01-31 12:25:53 that and the original plane already had them so too much work both swapping out the engines and recalibrating the control surfaces (gotta do it anyways)
events-chat 2022-01-31 15:45:41 I guess they will also pick the teams?
events-chat 2022-02-01 02:46:21 i see something. I will not say what, but you can probably figure it out
events-chat 2022-02-01 02:49:17 <@!849557593046777886> wingless plane how does that even turn?
events-chat 2022-02-01 02:50:19 barely
events-chat 2022-02-01 03:35:04 spin
events-chat 2022-02-01 03:39:33 yes.
events-chat 2022-02-01 03:42:19 some planes may be able to take more hits
events-chat 2022-02-01 03:43:21 motor locked planes included
events-chat 2022-02-01 03:44:15 i don't even know what that is
events-chat 2022-02-01 03:45:35 hey rbk, how can I submit something for hof
the-dump 2022-02-01 13:06:02 inaccurate not enough stalling
the-dump 2022-02-01 13:42:08 imagine going with a team I play this game solo

events-chat 2022-02-03 01:27:51 experimental fighter?
events-chat 2022-02-03 01:30:19 what's so experimental about it
events-chat 2022-02-03 01:31:34 rookie numbers
events-chat 2022-02-03 01:32:34 lemme guess, the tilt-wings?
events-chat 2022-02-03 01:32:56 is that with the tnt armor or without?
events-chat 2022-02-03 01:33:18 would recommend your normal one. the experimental one seems a little fragile
events-chat 2022-02-03 01:33:47 that makes sense. just aim for the cockpit instead of tail during event
events-chat 2022-02-03 01:35:00 <@!466793357318815744> what if we have a bonus round with only the bombers against each other?
events-chat 2022-02-03 01:35:19 sounds much sturdier and reliable
events-chat 2022-02-03 01:36:46 wait, <@!369303015267631104> how agile are both planes?
events-chat 2022-02-03 01:40:32 make it drift with thrust vectoring
events-chat 2022-02-03 01:46:34 the plane I'm gonna use is technically experimental but evolved out of that stage
the-dump 2022-02-03 02:33:11 you beat me to it
events-chat 2022-02-03 02:34:45 hmmmm aoa funnies you say :)
events-chat 2022-02-03 02:35:13 https://streamable.com/mctm64
events-chat 2022-02-03 02:36:19 It's got pitch control as well
events-chat 2022-02-03 02:37:21 A10 is the easiest to have thrust vectoring in PC due to its engine placement
events-chat 2022-02-03 02:46:40 oh boy this event's gonna be fun
events-chat 2022-02-03 02:46:58 I made it worse.

This is a pvp event not a beauty contest
events-chat 2022-02-03 13:51:30 he just has skill issue so he copes by looking down on other builds
events-chat 2022-02-03 13:51:53 also he uses emojis in every sentence so his opinion is invalid
events-chat 2022-02-03 13:55:48 hmmm?
events-chat 2022-02-03 13:57:20 nothing seems to break the rule so far
events-chat 2022-02-03 13:58:12 before you say the speed rbk increased the max speed to 350 sps
events-chat 2022-02-03 14:30:37 make xb-0

events-chat 2022-02-03 19:41:26 <@!841801936210624572> that looks more like a cyberpunk batman-esque flying car than a plane
events-chat 2022-02-03 19:42:42 yeah i get it. still, cyberpunk flying batmobile
events-chat 2022-02-03 19:43:37 oof. at least you got a okayish flying wing
events-chat 2022-02-03 19:45:17 swap the rockets out for hover engine, add bombs, make it a functional bomber for pvp
events-chat 2022-02-03 19:45:54 well there's that
events-chat 2022-02-03 19:46:38 the only concern I have for the time is if I gotta dip for lunch
events-chat 2022-02-03 19:48:04 imagine if everyone goes to church and only rbk shows up for the event

the-dump 2022-02-04 22:56:57 it's perfect
the-dump 2022-02-05 01:32:48 dig a hole under their house, steal their shit, and plant tnt there.
the-dump 2022-02-05 01:33:17 or even better, lavacast their house
the-dump 2022-02-05 01:35:32 but that's so quick. a slower longer lasting form of torment is better
the-dump 2022-02-05 01:35:53 lavacast or flood their home with a massive chunk of water
the-dump 2022-02-05 01:38:37 you're thinking too small. Giant crater is too cheap. Lavacasting or flooding caused the most torment since the build is still mostly intact but is done in such a way that it's not usable anymore/takes too much effort to fix
the-dump 2022-02-05 01:39:29 even better since it will stay there for them to see while tnt is "poof and gone"
the-dump 2022-02-05 01:40:54 no but have fun trying to enter or exit
the-dump 2022-02-05 01:44:22 the point of lavacasting is to do this. You don't need to worry about it not penetrating cobblestone since their base will be buried under a mountain.
the-dump 2022-02-05 01:44:40 oh shit even better. do both tnt and lavacasting
the-dump 2022-02-05 01:45:27 yep some people use lavacasting to do that, but for this purpose we are going to bury a base under a mountain then turn said base into a crater inside the mountain
the-dump 2022-02-05 01:46:14 perfection.
the-dump 2022-02-05 01:46:29 ultimate trolling
events-chat 2022-02-05 12:33:33 you could've used the entire tutorial...?
events-chat 2022-02-05 12:36:50 ~~oh I see~~ ***You dare challenge me with another modified tutorial a10***
events-chat 2022-02-05 12:37:22 
events-chat 2022-02-05 12:39:55 this is what it started as
events-chat 2022-02-05 12:40:44 all I did was strip most of the hover engines, replace them with rockets, and recalibrate some wing angles
events-chat 2022-02-05 12:41:56 currently the event version is roughly 618 blocks
events-chat 2022-02-05 12:42:12 i nerfed the speed way too much
events-chat 2022-02-05 12:43:15 I hollowed out the gun module on top and used it as a thruster pack since regular rockets weren't enough to support vtol
events-chat 2022-02-05 12:44:39 my normal speed is +900. The nerfed speed is a stable 283
events-chat 2022-02-05 12:45:39 it also maneuvers fast, both the nerfed and normal version
events-chat 2022-02-05 12:47:58 how well does it turn?
events-chat 2022-02-05 12:48:49 https://streamable.com/mctm64
events-chat 2022-02-05 12:51:28 this is not much conpared to some of the other planes here. I'm talking instant turns and maneuverability beyond what I can do.
events-chat 2022-02-05 12:52:38 aight
events-chat 2022-02-05 12:55:35 I'm thinking of making the thrust vectoring work on a standard tutorial a10. At the moment the mod is compatible but produces some stability issues
events-chat 2022-02-05 12:57:39 Mine still uses a fair bit of tutorial parts. The intakes and (some) wing are directly taken from another f14 tutorial but have undergone heavy modifications
events-chat 2022-02-05 12:57:59 well that's just plane crazy
events-chat 2022-02-05 12:58:53 motorlock+good gaming chair+skill+rtx on+made by hars

events-chat 2022-02-05 13:04:05 did you read <#621452102618578964> for instructions?
events-chat 2022-02-05 13:04:49 and more importantly did you check what srever you're in?
events-chat 2022-02-05 13:06:06 also how the hell did you submit a pic in <#917397949938548736> without the image rank
events-chat 2022-02-05 13:58:43 I could probably replace the gun on mine with underside motor turrets and make a gunship
events-chat 2022-02-05 14:01:04 that time works great for me
events-chat 2022-02-05 16:23:18 How long do the events typically last?
events-chat 2022-02-05 16:25:30 also the event takes place in vip 1 right?
events-chat 2022-02-05 16:33:02 oh okay
events-chat 2022-02-05 16:34:20 probably might have to go afk for a minute or two in the match to start the rice cooker but it should be fine lol
events-chat 2022-02-05 16:39:05 for the first event, yes.
events-chat 2022-02-05 16:39:50 
events-chat 2022-02-05 16:40:14 I'm switching to sunday event since I can't attend saturday event so I assume someone's gonna take my place
events-chat 2022-02-05 16:40:52 not picked yet
events-chat 2022-02-05 16:42:11 1) it's a hidden channel visible to selected contestants only
2) see <#917397949938548736> 
3) You may have noticed only 4 people are picked for each event, which is where this comes in:
events-chat 2022-02-05 16:43:02 wish that was the case, but the servers are 10 people only. Minus the mods (2 people) it would only be 8 contestants
events-chat 2022-02-05 16:43:25 good question. I have no idea
events-chat 2022-02-05 16:44:16 besides I'm not attending the 11pm saturday event. I'm attending the sunday event (I asked hyper to move me)
events-chat 2022-02-05 16:45:06 
events-chat 2022-02-05 16:45:24 I'm kidding this is a earlier pic
events-chat 2022-02-05 16:45:52 
events-chat 2022-02-05 16:48:07 it's a nerfed version of another plane, but nerf is a relative term since all I did was decrease speed and weapons along with removing a illegal feature
events-chat 2022-02-05 16:50:54 too many emojis
events-chat 2022-02-05 16:52:09 what the illegal feature?
events-chat 2022-02-05 16:53:23 there's worse
events-chat 2022-02-05 16:55:05 i found this
events-chat 2022-02-05 17:01:01 yes. that's what some of us did
events-chat 2022-02-05 18:56:24 uhh I can't attend today's tournie so you may have to find someone else in my place. I can only attend sunday's tournament
events-chat 2022-02-05 18:57:49 how will teams be picked?

events-chat 2022-02-06 01:56:36 thanks
events-chat 2022-02-06 01:59:14 also LETS GOOOOO A-10 GANG
the-dump 2022-02-06 02:54:29 fuck.
events-chat 2022-02-06 02:55:40 oh fuck I think I'm screwed
events-chat 2022-02-06 02:56:43 hi dad, where the fuck were you you dissapeared for 15 years after you said you were going to get milk
events-chat 2022-02-06 02:57:45 forget shooting you down I'm gonna down the bomber as fast as I can
events-chat 2022-02-06 02:59:13 ehhh I mean the a10s are a integral part of my team and shall play a key role in achieving victory in this event
events-chat 2022-02-06 03:24:00 hmmm...
events-chat 2022-02-06 03:24:42 <@466793357318815744> is it legal if I allocate 4 of my guns to repurposed missiles (without explosives) as support drones?
events-chat 2022-02-06 03:25:57 about that... have you seen gjsolo's pvp footage? he's one of the opponents
events-chat 2022-02-06 03:26:14 it one of the reasons I'm a little worried
events-chat 2022-02-06 03:28:31 exactly what I said. basically a mini arsenal bird as a deformed a10
events-chat 2022-02-06 03:28:46 which is why I'm worried
events-chat 2022-02-06 03:29:53 right. but someone's also gonna have to protect the bomber
events-chat 2022-02-06 03:30:28 what I was gonna say. I imagine he's gonna chase us down first then get the bomber
events-chat 2022-02-06 03:31:00 which is why I'm asking if parasite fighters are legal
events-chat 2022-02-06 03:31:17 oh fuck
events-chat 2022-02-06 03:31:49 soooo, are parasite fighters allowed?
events-chat 2022-02-06 03:32:18 i can really only have 4 anyways and it's not like I can make them too fast given the size of my plane
events-chat 2022-02-06 03:33:29 so I got 8 max guns right? I'm thinking of taking 4 of them off my plane and using them on drones instead as parasite fighters. no rockets, no cutters, just one gun each
events-chat 2022-02-06 03:34:01 mhm
events-chat 2022-02-06 03:35:38 yep
events-chat 2022-02-06 03:36:52 what nah I'm attending tomorrow's event
events-chat 2022-02-06 03:38:07 I've tested plane launched uavs in the past. Shouldn't be too hard to modify my plane into supporting some
events-chat 2022-02-06 03:39:02 1. I'm not flying a bomber
2. yes they are separately controlled
events-chat 2022-02-06 03:39:33 yep
events-chat 2022-02-06 03:39:50 this is either gonna be my best idea or worst one
events-chat 2022-02-06 03:40:54 yeah same. Think of it as boosting team numbers up by 4 weaker and smaller planes
events-chat 2022-02-06 03:41:51 I already have a hardpoint system made for dropping bombs. It's just a matter of a few modifications here and there
events-chat 2022-02-06 03:42:54 tbh I haven't tested even motor 2 missiles on the wyrtcatt yet so I'm not sure how well it'll fare.
events-chat 2022-02-06 03:51:08 I shall turn my xaf-142 into a amazon drone hub tomorrow
events-chat 2022-02-06 13:19:23 aight team name?
events-chat 2022-02-06 13:56:57 not our team
events-chat 2022-02-06 13:59:01 well I guess we're fucked now
events-chat 2022-02-06 14:06:14 they have gjsolo. adding boxnesz to their team would make it very unbalanced
events-chat 2022-02-06 14:06:50 I don't mean to be picky but we all know gjsolo's one of the best pvp players here no?
events-chat 2022-02-06 16:50:44 I like how this time none of the teams have colors designated because the builds already categorize themselves, mostly.
events-chat 2022-02-06 20:36:56 I can confirm the drones were a useless idea
events-chat 2022-02-06 20:41:08 what if we had no restriction pvp event
events-chat 2022-02-06 20:42:20 oh yeah, shredder event
events-chat 2022-02-06 21:49:19 I tried in the event. flying both a swarm of drones and a plane simultaneously is hard
events-chat 2022-02-06 21:52:22 boat soccer
events-chat 2022-02-06 21:59:36 called it
events-chat 2022-02-06 22:00:21 uhhh we didn't face their team
events-chat 2022-02-06 22:02:23 I learned that using a drone swarm with a plane simultaneously is not really effective
events-chat 2022-02-06 22:02:57 wait it actually did something?
events-chat 2022-02-06 22:03:53 "file encoding is not supported"
events-chat 2022-02-06 22:05:07 yeah last time I tried something like this was last year and only two unarmed drones
events-chat 2022-02-06 22:07:56 pvp montage with project wingman ost
events-chat 2022-02-06 22:08:55 close tracking is shittertin missile lock-on.

nobody's too sure what legacy really does; it's supposed to be a togglable bug fix but had some unexpected effects
events-chat 2022-02-06 22:09:58 i think that's a aforementioned side effect of the legacy setting
events-chat 2022-02-06 22:11:34 i remember someone asked for motorlock to be "nerfed" and got the entire server against him

events-chat 2022-02-06 22:20:17 I witnessed someone put a fucking conveyor engine in their tank before
events-chat 2022-02-06 22:21:39 I used to have a mega tank that took half the server 5 minutes to fully destroy, but it's disassembled and in storage atm
events-chat 2022-02-06 22:22:54 good gaming chair

the-dump 2022-02-07 23:19:40 well is that really wrong?
the-dump 2022-02-07 23:21:55 it is scripted tho
the-dump 2022-02-07 23:22:53 I have access to several smp servers but not motivated enough to play
the-dump 2022-02-07 23:24:12 the smps I join are good (no mods power tripping or shit) but I'm just not too interested in minecraft
the-dump 2022-02-07 23:26:17 I learned through playing smps to never build your house close to spawn.
the-dump 2022-02-07 23:26:51 came on one day to find it gone; no tnt or crater, no lava. just gone, like it was never there
the-dump 2022-02-07 23:27:17 not even a admin, it was just a random player
the-dump 2022-02-07 23:27:29 in hindsight it was kinda funny
the-dump 2022-02-07 23:27:49 yeah it was, 5x5 house
the-dump 2022-02-07 23:28:08 and like 200 or so blocks from spawn
the-dump 2022-02-07 23:29:19 Sadly that server no longer exists. the server (both discord and minecraft) just suddenly vanished one day
the-dump 2022-02-07 23:31:07 idk
the-dump 2022-02-07 23:34:51 ?
the-dump 2022-02-07 23:44:57 oh
the-dump 2022-02-07 23:58:11 used to have minecraft pe lite. good times
the-dump 2022-02-08 00:01:31 Ok jeez now you're making me feel old, lemme explain.
Minecraft mobile nowadays is just called Minecraft right? you can play with console players and others.
the-dump 2022-02-08 00:01:35 A long time ago when dinosaurs roamed the earth and mojang was separate from microsoft, Minecraft had a mobile version called Pocket Edition, or MCPE. That was a paid version, but there was a separate free version called MCPE lite; that one had only creative mode, limited blocks, and no saving.
the-dump 2022-02-08 00:02:19 yep
the-dump 2022-02-08 00:02:35 but before bedrock it was mcpe; console, pc, and mobile were separate
the-dump 2022-02-08 00:02:43 i dunno, the name just brought me back to the past
the-dump 2022-02-08 00:03:59 but still didn't give us back tix
the-dump 2022-02-08 00:04:25 hmm...
the-dump 2022-02-08 00:05:21 it's still shit
the-dump 2022-02-08 00:06:27 Welp now I'm curious. If I don't come back it's your fault for making me curious

events-chat 2022-02-11 03:24:06 so uhhh I'm not gonna attend the event, but I did something with the planes
events-chat 2022-02-11 03:25:10 Because I'm probably banned from the event after doing this to the planes
events-chat 2022-02-11 03:26:49 nonono you don't understand. the plane consists of:
yousuf fuselage
tincan tail
doof nose
obc wings

creations-chat 2022-02-13 16:34:19 so you don't think your build is good, and you show it in creations and somehow expect others to think it's good, then get upset when people say it's bad. the fuck kind of logic is that?

creations-chat 2022-03-05 13:44:23 <@598480813050560512> the plane itself is fine. the main issue would be the paintjob. There's also the issue where the f4 is overbuilt here thus (like most aircraft here) the standards are much, much higher.
creations-chat 2022-03-05 13:49:11 (ironically the fire tips are very likely the first thing you'll need to remove since pcc doesn't exactly like bright colors like that)
I would say do a better job with the color blending in the camo, if you have some issues try looking up both color pallets and images of the aircraft for reference.

also I just noticed this, don't use legacy glass for <#384025409945337856> builds. I know your plane is meant for pvp, but just switch it back after (pvp planes often have a hard time getting good upvote scores anyways so eh)

the-dump 2022-03-14 19:54:29 alright so this is how the plot of ff10 is gonna go: a shadowy organization uses bicycles to hijack a russian convoy carrying a superweapon that hijacks masks using 5g signals. Dom and his team will travel to the moon via a toyota prius strapped to a spacex starship to infiltrate their moon base to stop the superweapon, only to find that the head of the organization is Dom's long lost great grandma. The movie ends with the gang and Dom's grandmother together at a family barbecue after they blew up the moon base and returned to earth by stealing a dodge charger propelled by the explosion.

the-dump 2022-04-03 00:53:15 you have to
the-dump 2022-04-03 00:53:31 wait. it can take as long as a week (ping a mod if you dont get rank past 2 days or so)

the-dump 2022-04-08 21:08:38 
the-dump 2022-04-09 00:57:53 fallen kingdom? I remember the entire saga
the-dump 2022-04-09 01:06:52 i just found this via the discord subreddit lmao
the-dump 2022-04-09 01:07:19 discord literally tells everyone to go touch grass
the-dump 2022-04-09 01:08:16 some pcc members don't exactly like furry pfps, protogens included.
the-dump 2022-04-09 01:09:38 going back to the not liking part, it ties in with that
the-dump 2022-04-09 01:09:50 tbh it's kinda tame
the-dump 2022-04-09 01:09:58 there's worse
the-dump 2022-04-09 01:11:27 there's a inactive member here that blocked 3/4 of all members here simply for having certain pfps
the-dump 2022-04-09 01:12:11 yeah you're fine
the-dump 2022-04-09 01:12:31 the guy blocks anything that remotely looks like "anime" and I guess furries as well
the-dump 2022-04-09 01:12:57 you're fine
the-dump 2022-04-09 01:13:49 I won't say the specific username but I will note said guy has 4 expert ranks that he got by simply asking the mods immediately when he joined
the-dump 2022-04-09 01:15:16 I'm a bit of both and I simply don't give a shit
the-dump 2022-04-09 01:15:38 HOWEVER, I'm asian so I get a weeb pass
the-dump 2022-04-09 01:17:09 just watch alita battle angel to get the idea.
the-dump 2022-04-09 01:18:15 almost nobody in my irl friend circle is either a furry or a weeb (that I know of), except for my mother who is a weeb.
the-dump 2022-04-09 01:18:43 cop-out explanation: It's lost alien technology
the-dump 2022-04-09 01:19:46 yes, "your mom" jokes have no effect on me
the-dump 2022-04-09 01:20:36 I make weight jokes in front of my mother.

the-dump 2022-04-16 23:02:43 <:Thonk:509498568982134816> according to folklore, if a fish (carp or koi i think) swims up a waterfall or river it becomes a dragon. such is the case with magikarp evolving into gyarados (I also think). So what happens if that big chonker swims up a river?

<@486232069886705665> late to the party but from what I gathered, some idiot knowingly posted a modified tutorial, got all salty, and started shitting on everyone. then we found out he linked all his accounts to his discord (twitter, reddit, etc) and he basically doxxed himself. from what i heard he was basically your stereotypical basement degenerate weeb

creations-chat 2022-12-25 03:17:29 then get expert ranks with your builds if you're so confident
creations-chat 2022-12-25 03:19:32 oh fuck i forgot about the rice cooker. will do it eventually
creations-chat 2022-12-25 03:50:33 he asked mango to show his best build and mango got angry
creations-chat 2022-12-25 04:03:16 he's gonna start malding saying that you got upvoted because pcc is biased and unfair
creations-chat 2022-12-25 05:37:18 You are the first person I've ever seen actually make a detachable adfx-10 and I love you for it (no homo)
creations-chat 2022-12-25 05:39:44 I could probably do it but the problems would likely outweigh the benefits (and that's also because I'm not making a raven)
creations-chat 2022-12-25 05:42:51 I've tested air-launched drone swarms and I'd assume some of that can be translated over. Building it isn't the issue for me (besides designing it so it looks decent); it's getting it to function well that's a hassle

the-dump 2022-12-25 18:29:24 *why is that in your search history*
the-dump 2022-12-26 20:49:03 I'm scared to do it
the-dump 2022-12-26 20:49:18 you do it
the-dump 2022-12-26 20:49:35 well I'm not doing it then
the-dump 2022-12-26 20:49:52 just use incognito goober
the-dump 2022-12-26 20:50:05 Im having dinner outside rn you do it
the-dump 2022-12-26 20:54:36 you asked for it so you do it
the-dump 2022-12-26 20:55:42 btw you gotta type war_thunder for it to work. it's like that for most image boards
creations-chat 2022-12-29 03:42:16 no. make the fuselage chonkier, specifically the middle to rear portion
creations-chat 2022-12-29 03:49:24 color's too bright (also they don't blend well) and proportions are off. Make the vertical stabilizers steeper (and the bottom one too) and make the plane longer from the center to the nose. Also, move the wings back by one block. If you're trying to recreate the ZOE paint scheme, just use a single red color with slight adjustments, nothing too different; ZOE uses just one color in its livery.
creations-chat 2022-12-29 03:52:41 excluding the bottom fin, there is a visible curve on the bottom of the plane from the intake to the exhaust. a bit of a extreme request but maybe you could use some extra anglelocking to make that. it's a small detail that would make a huge difference (your current engine section looks pretty flat)
creations-chat 2022-12-29 03:56:14 ZOE but it became a discord moderator (fat)
creations-chat 2022-12-29 03:58:17 <@729396282493501504> I can't see shit in that image, get a daytime photo
thanks
creations-chat 2022-12-29 04:06:07 oops, my mistake (they look similar please don't kill me). still, my point stands. ZOE uses a consistent color in its paint scheme, and since they're the same airframe the proportions don't change
uhhhh.... is ZOE supposed to be more round or is that just the artist's style?
creations-chat 2022-12-29 04:08:35 ok, now make a functional RAW-F airframe to attach it to and give it the ability to detach when damaged <:trollface:775024642104229898>
creations-chat 2022-12-29 04:10:38 huh, i thought ZOE used the falken, which was built by grunder using information recovered from the morgan's wreckage.
https://acecombat.fandom.com/wiki/ADF-01_FALKEN
creations-chat 2022-12-29 04:13:24 ZOE is the ai that pilots the aircraft, the falken refers to the aircraft itself. ZOE also piloted several other aircraft, notably the adf-11f Raven in Ace combat 7.

<@761354294859005962> RAW-F is the designation for the larger part that consists of the wings of the adf-11f. the small drone itself is the adf-11
creations-chat 2022-12-29 04:18:50 Oh, that refers to the ace combat infinity aircraft. Infinity isn't canon since it's a mishmash of our world and strangreal events. that said, players could unlock special variants of different planes, the ADF-01 ZOE being one of them (There's also a ADFX-01 prototype block 2 or something like that if i remember)
Basically, infinity takes place in a different canon, much like assault horizon

<@761354294859005962> yeah I'm talking about that
creations-chat 2022-12-29 04:20:52 Me explaining ace combat lore for some reason:
creations-chat 2022-12-29 04:27:48 yes. he did, and i love him for it

creations-chat 2022-12-29 14:21:42 1. I ripped the wings off a x-02 because I can
2. you're thinking too small. look closely at it and see what it resembles (hint: it's NOT a morgan) <:trol:941148044026585128>
creations-chat 2022-12-29 14:24:44 also here you go, another view of the aircraft
creations-chat 2022-12-29 14:27:54 there's more <:trollface:775024642104229898>

creations-chat 2022-12-29 14:31:16 first. Do I look like vulpen to you?
second. it ended up okay anyways. don't worry, **it can get worse**
creations-chat 2022-12-30 00:14:27 for aeronautical role, it means using wings only for control surfaces; no propellers on wing tips for pitch or what have you. As for vtol, that isn't a restriction; as long as you aren't using helium or hover engines for either one you should be fine
creations-chat 2022-12-30 00:16:42 y'know, it never said anything against using ballasts~ üòâ
the-dump 2022-12-31 17:30:58 
the-dump 2022-12-31 18:02:00 
the-dump 2022-12-31 18:04:00 I like how within the rows of ya-10 pics there's a single armored core pic that comes outta nowhere
creations-chat 2023-01-01 14:20:26 yes they are actually bombs that are designed to roll off the side of the plane and into the intakes- of fucking course they're not weapons idiot why is that the first conclusion you come to?

they're likely heads up displays used for info like altitude and such. I do remember some modern planes have them. it's not exclusive to fighter jets
creations-chat 2023-01-01 14:22:43 did you know most technology used by the population originates from military technology? This is one such case.
the-dump 2023-01-01 17:34:55 what the fuck have you been watching
the-dump 2023-01-01 17:43:08 <:skul:1037864135515459705>
the-dump 2023-01-01 17:43:23 yeah, "random"
creations-chat 2023-01-01 17:46:25 correct. editing your screenshots via microsoft powerpoint is clearly the superior move
the-dump 2023-01-01 18:55:15 
the-dump 2023-01-02 22:14:37 people who think they're above others technically identify as something above human since they think they're better.
Therefore they are not human and therefore have no human rights.
the-dump 2023-01-02 22:19:45 and since they claim they are better that means that they are too good to interact with us, so we should segregate ourselves from them
the-dump 2023-01-02 22:21:04 actually, given the fact that they aren't human but look like people means we should help release them from their mortal shells by burning away their human bodies so they can ascend. it'll be fine, since they're better than us that means they won't feel pain
the-dump 2023-01-02 22:33:05 lmao people get angry at others critiquing their builds and their first conclusion is this server:
1. is homophobic
2. hates furries
3. is full of furries
4. is toxic as fuck because of the other 3
the-dump 2023-01-02 22:34:06 yeah they can, they serve in juvie though. different system

the-dump 2023-01-10 02:07:35 nonono, i mean **this** is just another day at work for the truck, sending people into another dimension
the-dump 2023-01-10 02:08:06 honestly it'll be funny if someone made a scp article out of this trope
the-dump 2023-01-10 02:09:12 while it's commonly seen as a honda brand truck, it has been reported to take on the appearance of alternate vehicles or brands of trucks
the-dump 2023-01-10 02:09:36 nah it'll be euclid
the-dump 2023-01-10 02:10:44 anyone who gets hit by the truck will vanish from sight. However, upon further research it has been discovered that the subject will have been transported into a alternate dimension
the-dump 2023-01-10 02:11:25 there have also been cases recorded where the subject reappears in a random location after a minimum of [redacted] months
the-dump 2023-01-10 02:12:13 lmao we're just writing this article in here right now
the-dump 2023-01-10 02:12:34 because i brought it up with the truck
the-dump 2023-01-10 02:13:47 sadly no longer a peanut
the-dump 2023-01-10 02:14:11 look at how they massacred my boy
the-dump 2023-01-10 02:14:37 interesting tags...
the-dump 2023-01-10 02:18:33 average reformer mindset (f14 is outdated)
but i kinda like that idea, what if we rebuild and modernize the f14 from the ground up
the-dump 2023-01-10 02:19:23 imagine a f15 with f22 engines
the-dump 2023-01-10 02:20:12 so the engines blow themselves up
the-dump 2023-01-10 02:21:22

the-dump 2023-01-12 03:42:43 lmao, this reminds me of a school project i had last year
the-dump 2023-01-12 03:43:10 we were given a budget and had to find parts online to make a pc for different roles
the-dump 2023-01-12 03:43:31 yeah, also had some funny results
the-dump 2023-01-12 03:43:37 yeah
the-dump 2023-01-12 03:43:39 totall
the-dump 2023-01-12 03:44:32 so for example, one of my classmates "made" a mid-budget pc for a call center. she chose a black computer case because it was more suitable for a professional office environment
the-dump 2023-01-12 03:45:16 i on the other hand, chose the 5000+ budget to make a computer for nasa. I gave it a glass case and shit tons of rgb (and liquid cooling) <:trol:941148044026585128>
the-dump 2023-01-12 03:45:40 ~~i got extra marks for the rgb~~
the-dump 2023-01-12 03:46:06 yeah i got full marks
the-dump 2023-01-12 03:46:09 it was funny though
the-dump 2023-01-12 03:46:39 clearly alibaba and wish.com the better store for buying computer parts
the-dump 2023-01-12 03:47:03 the threadripper?

the-dump 2023-01-13 21:56:15 idk
the-dump 2023-01-13 22:08:56 Also, I think the rotating part might be better somewhere near the middle (you see those in scifi stuff a lot because those are actually parts of a space station that theoretically use centrifugal force to generate artificial gravity).

the-dump 2023-02-17 20:22:00 shooting it with bullets won't cause it to descend fast enough
the-dump 2023-02-17 20:22:53 similar situation happened back in 1998 with a runaway weather balloon; the balloon remained aloft despite being shot multiple times
the-dump 2023-02-17 20:22:56 https://apnews.com/article/268893fddde785d029d5a51b136951eb
the-dump 2023-02-17 22:17:04 No, it has more to do with the fact that those balloons aren't rubber party balloons (they don't pop when you shoot them) and they doesn't leak instantly when you shoot them. Large balloon = a shitload of gas, so a small hole isn't gonna leak all the helium (or whatever they use) out instantly. Riddling it with several thousand bullets and more holes may make them leak faster but at that rate you might as well shoot it with a missile; no aa guns with airburst rounds have the kind of operating height that the balloon was flying at
the-dump 2023-02-17 22:17:26 tl;dr, big fucking balloon doesn't leak instantly and aa guns don't have the range
the-dump 2023-02-17 22:17:58 ye
the-dump 2023-02-17 22:18:00 more or less
the-dump 2023-02-17 22:18:20 it's also why the government was begging civilians not to shoot the balloon
the-dump 2023-02-17 22:19:27 airburst rounds might be more effective, but as I said, practically no aa gun has that kind of range and I don't think planes carry airburst rounds
the-dump 2023-02-17 22:22:09 wait... what if... *smokes reformer-grade crack* we repurpose a-10s to shoot spy balloons... <:OmegaTroll:626841385118597152>
the-dump 2023-02-17 22:46:58 service ceiling isn't high enough
the-dump 2023-02-17 22:50:36 ....which makes the a-10 idea even more unviable and dumb since that thing has a max service ceiling of 45k feet (on a clean loadout, meaning no bombs, no ammo, nothing), even less than the ac130
the-dump 2023-02-17 22:54:04 at the end of a day maybe a missile is the best option...
the-dump 2023-02-17 23:20:45 exactly
the-dump 2023-02-17 23:21:12 people see "balloon" and immediately think it's a dollar store balloon that can be popped with a needle

the-dump 2023-05-25 01:03:21 i just got used to it
the-dump 2023-05-25 01:32:36 basically 98% of the scalable energy sources we have at the moment is __ spins a motor to make energy go brrrr
the-dump 2023-05-25 01:40:57 only examples i can think of that don't do this are solar power and possibly fuel cells.
the-dump 2023-05-25 01:44:29 why
the-dump 2023-05-25 01:44:37 no
the-dump 2023-05-25 01:46:30 there are other power sources that don't rely on boiling water such as pizeoelectricity or thermovoltaics but those are not used on commercial scale as standalone generators
the-dump 2023-05-25 01:48:15 oh, and it is hypothetically possible to convert nuclear power directly into electricity, bypassing the boiling water part, but currently those are either hypothetical or done in lab conditions

the-dump 2023-06-15 12:41:07 the amount of people who think starting a jet aircraft is like starting a car is absurd
the-dump 2023-06-15 12:43:18 though credit where it's due, extreme maneuvers like that can probably be done more easily with fly-by-wire since you're not the one doing it especially when you consider most modern fighter jets use that
the-dump 2023-06-15 12:44:39 when you think about it almost all modern aircraft are more or less manned drones
help 2023-06-18 20:57:32 old glitch

the-dump 2023-06-21 21:29:31 every fandom has a cursed side
the-dump 2023-06-21 21:29:40 it's just some have a bigger cursed-to-uncursed ratio
creations-chat 2023-06-23 03:38:06 no.

the-dump 2023-06-29 03:03:27 oh no.
the-dump 2023-06-29 03:04:30 unironically
the-dump 2023-06-29 03:06:44 no
the-dump 2023-06-29 03:14:38 so quick warning: source material involves gore
the-dump 2023-06-29 03:15:42 and not the "based guy beats catgirl with lead pipe" type either
the-dump 2023-06-29 03:16:04 that's all i'll say
the-dump 2023-06-29 03:17:41 ^
the-dump 2023-06-29 03:18:39 honestly i'm slightly surprised and thankful that vid is not spammed a lot, if at all, anywhere
the-dump 2023-06-29 03:27:03 ...you searched it didn't you
the-dump 2023-06-29 03:27:14 i'm so sorry for what you witnessed
the-dump 2023-06-29 03:53:05 YOU LOOKED IT UP TOO?
the-dump 2023-06-29 03:53:35 ok
the-dump 2023-06-29 03:53:42 nothing
the-dump 2023-06-29 03:53:45 do not search it
the-dump 2023-06-29 03:53:49 you will regret it
creations-chat 2023-06-30 20:31:18 what did he say?
creations-chat 2023-06-30 20:34:29 one's a motorlock spaghetti mess, the other one's a literal brick
creations-chat 2023-06-30 20:36:31 you gotta angle the hull up more, I'd say make the bow maybe 2 blocks thinner
creations-chat 2023-06-30 20:38:55 scale down the ramp a little. overall it looks promising (agreed pvp builds don't need to be shit)
creations-chat 2023-06-30 20:41:37 make the bow less wide?
creations-chat 2023-06-30 21:06:43 oh jeez nevermind
the-dump 2023-07-01 00:31:06 false, the towers will collapse from visible structual fatigue
the-dump 2023-07-01 11:59:40 it also appears that the towers are twisting from torque caused by windspeed and possibly the aircraft flying in between, therefore it is more likely that they will collapse from structural failure in a short period of time
the-dump 2023-07-02 13:13:07 yeahhhh touhou references aren't exactly a known thing in pcc
the-dump 2023-07-02 13:13:26 don't try to explain it either it'll get worse without context
