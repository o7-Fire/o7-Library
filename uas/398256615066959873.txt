the-dump 2020-09-02 00:03:27 Don't you just hate it when your creation spontaneously turns into a solar system?
creations-chat 2020-09-05 16:08:05 It's almost the same picture

creations-chat 2020-09-12 16:47:56 Pretty sure blimps are VTOL
creations-chat 2020-09-15 13:47:42 ngl the problem with most A-10 builds is that they aren't building the plane around the gun, which is how you're supposed to build it.
creations-chat 2020-09-15 13:49:17 But tbf it is a kinda ugly plane
creations-chat 2020-09-15 13:50:34 Its only purpose is getting that main gun above the enemy and blasting them, and it does that pretty dang well
creations-chat 2020-09-15 13:52:05 I think it flies on like 1 engine and 1 wing

creations-chat 2020-09-16 15:18:31 So like
creations-chat 2020-09-16 21:04:26 It's a giant fan pointed upwards with a cockpit and a box attached to it
creations-chat 2020-09-16 22:28:42 Wus wrong with cylinders?
creations-chat 2020-09-17 03:14:37 Full of water?
creations-chat 2020-09-17 03:15:10 Wouldn't that make it a boat with a huge ballast tank

creations-chat 2020-09-17 03:25:03 You know it might have gone better if you didn't call it an F35
creations-chat 2020-09-17 05:23:02 I'd say stack giant plates and fold them out in a spiral but that may leave unwanted gaps in the art
creations-chat 2020-09-17 14:37:48 It's a sacred religious artifact
creations-chat 2020-09-17 14:39:07 Oh snap lemme hit that <:Downvote:490311668556103700>

creations-chat 2020-09-17 14:58:54 Wasn't that working earlier
creations-chat 2020-09-17 19:04:43 Not all plane crazy cars are built with suspensions
creations-chat 2020-09-17 19:05:13 Plane crazy cars
creations-chat 2020-09-17 19:05:18 Too small to contain suspension
creations-chat 2020-09-17 19:05:44 And people still don't use it

creations-chat 2020-09-18 01:03:05 crrer
creations-chat 2020-09-18 01:03:42 I see a tank
creations-chat 2020-09-18 12:06:39 Pixel art is so different compared to actual builds
creations-chat 2020-09-18 12:57:10 Good scare
creations-chat 2020-09-18 14:10:40 I'd tell you unpowered motors and train wheels but bullet trains have neither
creations-chat 2020-09-19 13:49:56 It's just a scorpion with a ring on its head
creations-chat 2020-09-19 13:50:02 How much can it really suck

creations-chat 2021-06-04 23:41:01 Fabric being the lightest material keeps me from having to use... ugh.. Helium. Also yes, fabric has a high contrast which makes it way easier to build with. Eventually I'll get it down to diamond plate but this is a very early version as you can tell with the test flight.
creations-chat 2021-06-04 23:43:57 Ice is way too bright, I'm mostly building at night. 

Just trying to see how I can improve the plane's handling besides improving my own pilot skills
creations-chat 2021-06-05 00:11:16 Would've gotten 100+ upvotes if he just called it an A-10 and nothing else. All you really need is the gun.
the-dump 2021-06-07 14:12:51 Cmon, do the thing

bug-reports 2021-08-13 02:11:13 I've been building one particular device all day today, and over the course of over tens of thousands of blocks, my data has been getting rolled back to the original save every time I leave and rejoin the game

My username is Janitorette and it's particularly affecting the one build I have in my 13th slot as well as any data in every single other slot. I literally cannot save content in the game.

Is some practical easter egg joke with 13 being an unlucky number or is Plane Crazy just screwing me over rn?
bug-reports 2021-08-13 02:30:27 I did and I always do
bug-reports 2021-08-13 02:30:41 Even autosave doesn't work because the entire datastore is rolled back
bug-reports 2021-08-13 02:31:00 I'm on pc and no, the data storage isn't full
bug-reports 2021-08-13 02:31:07 It's a little over halfway at best
bug-reports 2021-08-13 02:31:13 And it's affecting every slot
bug-reports 2021-08-13 02:33:04 No my pc is perfectly fine, but my data is being rolled back
bug-reports 2021-08-13 05:07:31 I can't until tomorrow, but I will first thing
bug-reports 2021-08-13 05:07:58 Take a picture of my datastore..
bug-reports 2021-08-13 05:08:25 Tomorrow?
bug-reports 2021-08-13 05:08:45 Technically today
bug-reports 2021-08-13 05:09:34 Okay but is there a point to this?
bug-reports 2021-08-13 05:10:14 Yes, I'm experiencing a game breaking bug that has cost me 9 hours of progress today
bug-reports 2021-08-13 05:10:56 Because the data is being rolled back whenever I leave the game and rejoin
bug-reports 2021-08-13 05:12:25 Change servers/log off/switch to pvp
bug-reports 2021-08-13 05:13:12 Please get off of bug reports there are actual problems here
bug-reports 2021-08-13 15:33:51 Alright here's the storage
bug-reports 2021-08-13 16:36:46 Wha
bug-reports 2021-08-13 16:36:51 But it's not full?
bug-reports 2021-08-13 16:46:14 So in other words, I might already be maxed out on data?
bug-reports 2021-08-13 17:18:52 So I don't actually have as much space as the numbers initially say I do?
creations-chat 2021-08-14 17:12:58 https://streamable.com/fv1zv7

Any idea how to hull it up and make the head a bit more controllable?

creations-chat 2022-06-28 07:23:45 Jets are so oversatured tbh
bug-reports 2022-07-21 18:27:49 You don't have as much save space as it says. Try deleting a few builds to clear it up, and only use one slot next time.
creations-chat 2022-09-09 23:53:43 That's the front and back difference
creations-chat 2022-12-29 20:16:02 Looks like shit
