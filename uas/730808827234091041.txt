> But make them add alot of weight to your build
> For the large builds they are meant for this would be no problem easy peasy but for small spam boxes there things can't be spammed on them as easily
<@!407347404858458123> Weight wont really work, because motors can be given higher torque allowing them to handle more weight, also most spam cars i see dont go off the ground, and if there is weight you can easily just spamm helium

X02D was made by erusea in 2024
it was a cheaper version of the X02 by removing the folding wing mechanism and making it shorter.
creations-chat 2021-02-22 14:06:51 there is just a small amount and the vertical tail is angled
creations-chat 2021-02-22 14:17:27 yeah not finnished ima give it the flat duck'

no i just didnt want to make the useless feature

creations-chat 2021-05-17 16:42:53 got mine not by meme build

~~yeah it was by posting a build from a popular franchise~~

tho 90 upvotes on a PVP build is quite impresive

PVP jets are 99.9999% of the time immune to shredders
creations-chat 2021-05-17 16:45:10 reason why Jets outclass shredders is due to Most shredders having speeds from 250-550

besides its kept to a acceptable amount
creations-chat 2021-05-18 18:31:23 Over compression

and weight balance

290 blocks, trying to get it to 250 

yeah sure skill is going to solve lag by itself
creations-chat 2021-05-18 18:33:34 <@!608204785384030208> towerlocking will just make it inflated block count, entire inside is using hover drives

creations-chat 2022-01-07 08:34:00 <@!712263443658440714> its been done alot but by using the snow blaster block (only obtainable in winter)

its too the point people have exploits that would generate images using said things, id send a image but most of the ones i have in archive are less than- family friendly
creations-chat 2022-01-07 08:39:13 yes but using snow blasters does not leave gaps between the pixels

creations-chat 2022-03-04 11:29:05 <@!846031383432396840> why is it so thin
creations-chat 2022-03-07 19:05:14 I don’t have a reference image, but I think you made it too short, that’s why the wing looks off… maybe add 2-4 blocks to the length/ move the entire back part by 2-4 then work the wing from their and ya should be good to go
