creations-chat 2023-02-17 18:10:01 <@780707080637382667> that spitfire looks worse than the tutorial one, and you ruined the beautiful wing

creations-chat 2023-02-17 21:27:15 <@877324830461030430> joke’s on you, i am a guy
creations-chat 2023-02-17 21:40:44 January 6th, aint new my ass
creations-chat 2023-02-17 21:46:51 I clicked on it without thinking, it’s just a crappy southwest airlines 737 build
creations-chat 2023-02-18 08:26:46 But yours looks like shit, you ruined the elliptical wing, and I’m sure you could have built it to have high performance, without sacrificing the design and beauty of the Spitfire. Also, now that you mention the tutorial, the fuselage looks almost identical to the tutorial one.
creations-chat 2023-02-19 08:44:24 <@854567628198772757> Although I think the twin towers are beautiful, i have to disagree with you on them being the most beautiful. The One World Trade Center, which replaced the twin towers, has a way more symbolic design, which imo is the most beautiful tower in the USA.

contest-chat 2023-02-21 19:27:20 Infinity isn’t a number
contest-chat 2023-02-21 19:28:57 It’s an idea
contest-chat 2023-02-21 19:33:06 But a number tells you the exact quantity of something, infinity only tells you that something is without ending, not the exact amount, therefore it’s not a number
contest-chat 2023-02-21 19:38:00 But infinity can be used outside of numbers, so it shouldn’t be a number
