creations-chat 2020-05-21 17:12:59 Falcon 9 Staging method: In the first picture those light gray bits will grab onto the also light gray engine in the second image. I will paint the little gray bits black but it's just so you can see them.
creations-chat 2020-05-21 17:18:38 I probably will make the engine bell better so it fits easier in the booster
creations-chat 2020-05-21 17:29:48 Update: I made it easier for the same engine to go into the interstage
creations-chat 2020-05-22 20:25:48 Falcon 9 Booster on glass platform above ocean (Thanks colson09 for making the platform)

creations-chat 2020-05-26 21:15:53 I forgot that opportunity looked like that
creations-chat 2020-05-26 21:16:07 is the wheel base the same?
creations-chat 2020-05-26 21:16:11 oh ok
creations-chat 2020-05-26 21:16:31 ima try to get reference pics of opportunity then
creations-chat 2020-05-26 21:17:09 yeah the reference picture I had I think was curiosity

creations-chat 2020-05-26 21:18:36 wait is the left curiosity or opportunity
creations-chat 2020-05-26 21:18:57 ok so I do curiosity
creations-chat 2020-05-26 21:19:09 ok
creations-chat 2020-05-26 21:26:05 <@!335176451038904331> The wheels are all the same size correct?
creations-chat 2020-05-26 21:28:58 ok thanks
creations-chat 2020-05-26 23:42:39 Right set of wheels for Curiosity
creations-chat 2020-05-28 21:43:57 <@!697786877444358186>  tbh that Falcon 9 isn't "very large" when looking at most other Falcon 9's and saying the 1st stage can land without any help would mean no landing legs or no propulsive landing
creations-chat 2020-05-28 21:44:59 if robloxians were 1 foot, the Falcon 9 would be many many times larger
creations-chat 2020-05-28 21:45:44 they are smaller than the Saturn V but an acuratly sized one would be very big
creations-chat 2020-05-28 21:46:15 btw its kinda official robloxians are about 1 foot tall
creations-chat 2020-05-28 21:46:40 I didn't either until a couple months back
creations-chat 2020-05-28 21:48:03 that is probably around his Falcon 9
creations-chat 2020-05-28 21:48:34 but a good scale would make it 229.6 feet tall
creations-chat 2020-05-28 21:48:42 229.6 feet is the real height
creations-chat 2020-05-28 21:49:30 probs not for like 15 secs then maybe it starts to go or something
creations-chat 2020-05-28 21:49:41 yes to which
creations-chat 2020-05-28 23:34:59 <@!409676438682206218> I know how the off- blocks work its upside down cutters with half blocks on the side

creations-chat 2020-06-09 01:18:12 so they do have them, but the real ones have tiny wings more up and that can be done easily
creations-chat 2020-06-09 01:58:58 the wings aren't meant to be large they're meant to be sort of small

creations-chat 2020-06-09 02:07:42 probably has happened lots of times but with other things
creations-chat 2020-06-09 02:08:07 that's kinda why when I start my yt I don't want to make large build tutorials
creations-chat 2020-06-09 02:08:36 probably will make some on things like conveyor engine or hover thruster engines
creations-chat 2020-06-09 02:08:53 yeah pretty much

creations-chat 2020-06-20 19:47:27 why
creations-chat 2020-06-20 19:47:41 that's the point
creations-chat 2020-06-20 19:47:46 you SHOULD try
creations-chat 2020-06-20 19:48:23 so it's slightly edited it's still a lazy build and picture setup
creations-chat 2020-06-20 19:48:38 how?
creations-chat 2020-06-20 19:48:47 it's just a booster
creations-chat 2020-06-20 19:49:17 then how did you have Starship on it
creations-chat 2020-06-20 19:50:21 dragon 2 is not a rocket so how does it look like a rocket
creations-chat 2020-06-20 19:50:41 that looks nothing like his rocket
creations-chat 2020-06-20 19:51:22 his is very long, has 9 engines, doesnt have exterior fins, and more stuff
creations-chat 2020-06-20 19:52:14 is that a hatch on top of the booster?
creations-chat 2020-06-20 19:53:10 bruh the pretty much no rockets have stage seperation that has a full hatch/trapdoor that opens up for who knows what
creations-chat 2020-06-20 20:31:49 <@!386561321422028800>  it will be hard to make a 1:1 scale because it is a fact that robloxians are 1foot all on average (10-12 inches) and because a player is 2 blocks, that would mean that you have to make you're starship around 800 blocks tall
creations-chat 2020-06-20 20:35:55 plus it would have to be 60 blocks wide so you physically cant make starship and not even a fraction of it
creations-chat 2020-06-20 23:23:13 <@!550694959011987457> actually if you are making Starship and Super Heavy (The booster / 1st stage) It is 2 stages, looking at the pictures, the height proves that you are making Super Heavy too, so that counts as 2 stages.
creations-chat 2020-06-20 23:23:53 you got my upvote

bug-reports 2020-07-03 02:18:10 I'm trying to make a Lunar Lander, but seemingly Metal Stairs are super heavy and imbalence my lander by a lot, when I change it to a half block, it tips back a bit, when I make it a stair block, it goes forwards really far and where it's happening is close to the center of the build.
bug-reports 2020-07-03 02:21:10 ok and also it might just be a one time thing because my centre of mass is being really weird
bug-reports 2020-07-03 02:21:50 no it's all touching/above the ground
bug-reports 2020-07-03 02:22:52 this shows the center of mass
bug-reports 2020-07-03 02:23:10 but it still moves back when nothing really changeds
bug-reports 2020-07-03 02:23:21 yeah but not that much

creations-chat 2020-08-01 17:17:26 <@!461644261566185503> , that is nowhere near 1:1 scale, if it truly was to scale, it would be about 60 blocks wide, if you used the incorrect scale, it would still be about 20 blocks wide, but yours looks at most, around 15 wide, so yeah, you're BFR is in no way to scale. and if you're like "it's not supposed to be 60 blocks, the BFR isn't that huge!" you're wrong. It is a FACT that Robloxians are 10-12 inches, so that would mean a block is about 1/2 foot, and the BFR is about 30 feet wide, the math proves it would be 60 blocks wide.
creations-chat 2020-08-01 17:46:03 still, it would be 20 blocks, yours is at MOST 15 blocks

creations-chat 2020-08-04 22:39:21 <@!407525924096180224> Those legs are in no way accurate, the airbrakes aren't accurate and they don't seem to do anything, you're missing fins, and I doubt a single engine of any kind in this game could work as an abort engine, there is a gap between the interstage and the capsule, the interstage shape is sort of thin for the scale, and the whole thing isn't scaled right
creations-chat 2020-08-04 22:40:15 its a big pile of incorrect features
creations-chat 2020-08-05 17:16:46 <@!551573378662662145> That Falcon 9 is really good, but the thing that I really hate about is that you say "Falcon Rocket" instead of "Falcon 9" so please, when refering to it, call it "Falcon 9"

creations-chat 2020-08-09 06:44:20 the top of the core stage is where it goes in a bit and the sloped part is the darker gray
creations-chat 2020-08-09 06:44:36 that core stage was about 45 blocks tall
creations-chat 2020-08-09 06:45:17 I made a rocket with a core stage standing at about 60-65 blocks tall I don't want to count
creations-chat 2020-08-09 06:46:42 This is most of the new rocket complete, the giant dark gray part is the core stage, again standing at 60-65 blocks tall, I just need to the capsule set from the other rocket onto this

creations-chat 2020-08-20 18:04:43 <@!681140863845269602>  that seems like bs because "It's ultra-compact design allows it to handle roads very well and achieve more aerodynamics and thus speed." Roads are flat and easy to drive on and "more aerodynamics and thus speed." that part is just a lie, a land vehicle's shape DOES NOT matter for aerodynamics and also the front of that car is flat

bug-reports 2020-09-19 18:31:28 My capsule has piston legs but whenever it's just the piston arms touching the ground it starts to bounce a lot
bug-reports 2020-09-19 18:32:06 <@456226577798135808> that's intended I think its for better takeoff so people dont run off the runway then takeoff
bug-reports 2020-09-19 18:33:57 and for my post when I go to >30 gravity it stops bouncing and I'm guessing it's because of the weight (the pistons are at 1.75 distance and 2500 max force)
bug-reports 2020-09-19 23:55:21 its at max
bug-reports 2020-09-19 23:55:26 2500 is the max
bug-reports 2020-09-19 23:55:37 I said it was at 2500

creations-chat 2020-11-09 21:30:22 <@456226577798135808> , more pics? and that colouring is not accurate.
creations-chat 2020-11-09 21:31:55 and I think (judging by the 2 legs you can which are at 90 degrees) there are 4 legs (There should be 3)
and don't say "but you can't do 3 legs" I've made a kinda crappy and old Starhopper with 3 legs at the right angles
creations-chat 2020-11-09 21:34:50 I was just trying to say don't say that and what about the colours?
creations-chat 2020-11-09 21:36:22 but why did you make it that colour in the first place?
that's what I want to know
creations-chat 2020-11-09 21:40:53 2 things, the entire top is in no way either a black or gray, it pretty much all stainless steel, and while fixing the legs, fix the feet, yours have large circles like the Apollo LM, but the real Starhopper doesn't have those, and it's like 5PM for me
creations-chat 2020-11-09 21:43:16 and the feet?
creations-chat 2020-11-09 21:45:42 it's it now? lemme go super saiyan and say: the engine is pretty large, the cylinder is pretty much a rounded square, and the nose cone's a bit steep
how's that for "that's it now"
creations-chat 2020-11-09 21:47:19 I remember when I just wanted to point out a few things I noticed that were wrong and notify you but you get all annoyed that you didn't try to make it accurate
and no, I'm not expecting you to fix it all right now I just want you to know what to fix if you want to keep working on it
creations-chat 2020-11-09 21:50:01 because you keep trying to make excuses but it's obvious you just didn't try
