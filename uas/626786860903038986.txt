creations-chat 2022-06-05 09:27:50 it's not.
creations-chat 2022-06-05 09:32:07 no because i made my own tutorial and published it. i made this bomb completley out of my mind and not a tutorial.
creations-chat 2022-06-05 09:34:13 the front & the back is very diffrent. sides too. i swear i didnt use madvulpen's tutorial. i made a tutorial myself.
creations-chat 2022-06-05 09:36:15 no i swear i didnt. the nose is seriously just a pyramid wedge and a locked motor together. its so simple a person with 2 days could make it. i swear i did not use the tutorial
creations-chat 2022-06-05 09:38:45 if you dont belive me then i have a link to the tutorial i made, its super diffrent to madvulpens.
