creations-chat 2019-02-15 19:17:51 
creations-chat 2019-02-15 19:17:56 you build has the same front
creations-chat 2019-02-15 19:18:02 and the same side circles
creations-chat 2019-02-15 19:18:11 and the same top decor
creations-chat 2019-02-15 19:18:26 and the same building style
creations-chat 2019-02-15 19:18:36 and the same colors
creations-chat 2019-02-15 19:18:56 same rear engine style (a bit different but still)
creations-chat 2019-02-15 19:19:16 ik
creations-chat 2019-02-15 19:20:28 he did copy it
creations-chat 2019-02-15 19:20:38 the grey is the same color
creations-chat 2019-02-15 19:21:11 and the same grey 75,75,75
creations-chat 2019-02-15 19:21:48 thats the dark grey 75,75,75
creations-chat 2019-02-15 19:22:50 you copyed the detailed parts
creations-chat 2019-02-15 19:23:04 down to the outer frame decor
creations-chat 2019-02-15 19:23:37 is basically a mini one of my ship
creations-chat 2019-02-15 19:24:10 ik
creations-chat 2019-02-15 19:24:50 the side stuff are the same
creations-chat 2019-02-15 19:25:15 it even widens in the middle
creations-chat 2019-02-15 19:25:44 it widens at the middle and the middle has the circles in it
creations-chat 2019-02-15 19:25:53 same as mine
creations-chat 2019-02-15 19:26:40 no i do not give him permission to copy it
creations-chat 2019-02-15 19:28:38 copying design is not fair because people spend hours trying to find the style they like for the type of space ship they want to make
creations-chat 2019-02-15 19:29:01 nino_f what is your ship based off of?
creations-chat 2019-02-15 19:29:50 what is the picture you based it off of
creations-chat 2019-02-15 19:30:16 cause for me i did not base it off of and pictures i just made it in my mind
creations-chat 2019-02-15 19:31:17 LOLLLL
creations-chat 2019-02-15 19:31:30 but it is based off of my space ship
creations-chat 2019-02-15 19:31:54 even the side circle DECOR HAVE WING LIGHTS ON THEM
creations-chat 2019-02-15 19:32:42 like the chances of you adding wing lights on the 3*3*1  cylinders and add all the other details are basically 0
creations-chat 2019-02-15 19:33:36 even the sides are wedges
creations-chat 2019-02-15 19:37:02 that is just getting a rocket and shooting at your build

help 2020-11-18 03:27:19 add rockets that spin the entire thing into a gyro
help 2020-11-18 03:28:15 spin your camera around
help 2020-11-18 03:28:27 cause you see the world rotates around your camera
help 2020-11-18 03:28:38 so in theory it should rotate the entire space ship
help 2020-11-18 03:29:53 idk man
help 2020-11-18 03:30:09 cause since your camera is the center of the world
help 2020-11-18 03:30:20 and everything apears 2 rotate around u
help 2020-11-18 03:30:42 then if u spin around then u should make the entire PC worl da gyro along with your rocket
help 2020-11-18 03:30:47 cause logic

help 2020-11-19 17:56:23 Also what are the 2nd and 3rd lightest materials
help 2020-11-19 17:56:37 ok
help 2020-11-19 17:56:46 can you tell me please?
help 2020-11-19 17:57:21 ok
help 2020-11-19 17:57:26 well that's fine
help 2020-11-19 17:57:44 ok
help 2020-11-19 17:57:46 ty
help 2020-11-19 17:58:12 yeah I need to make something with very little mass
help 2020-11-19 17:58:20 other wise it might not work
help 2020-11-19 17:58:40 so ty
help 2020-11-19 17:58:49 is foil the lightest?
help 2020-11-19 17:59:12 what's so special about foil?
help 2020-11-19 18:04:34 well true but I am using fabric half wedges.
help 2020-11-19 18:05:04 Aka  the smallest block (other then trails and sighs) with the lightest material
help 2020-11-19 18:05:09 <@!635257828772413440>  in the light bulb
help 2020-11-19 18:05:22 on top of the seats
creations-chat 2020-11-19 18:10:35 Gpu
creations-chat 2020-11-19 18:12:12 Red stuff go up and down allowing the pins (trails) to go though them if the correct combo is read making only one output. Each letter, number, and symbol you can type will have it's own combo. The pins will push text blocks onto A conveyor that will move the text blocks onto the screen.
creations-chat 2020-11-19 18:37:08 <@456226577798135808>  sure what do you need help with
help 2020-11-19 18:40:57 I see find a mech tutorial on yt.
<@!698944372728791158>  We have sensors
help 2020-11-19 18:41:34 you can make sensors
help 2020-11-19 18:41:36 in pc
help 2020-11-19 18:45:53 you make them
help 2020-11-19 18:46:03 like for my ciws
help 2020-11-19 18:46:07 you move the turret
help 2020-11-19 18:46:08 and aim
help 2020-11-19 18:46:15 and then you lock onto the target
help 2020-11-19 18:46:19 and then it shoots it down
help 2020-11-19 18:46:38 it shoots A thing that gets stuck inside the other plane/heli
help 2020-11-19 18:47:03 and that thing is attached to the turret with suspension
help 2020-11-19 18:47:26 so when the pane / heli moves it turns the turret
help 2020-11-19 18:47:59 it doesn't accommodate for the speed of the target and the gravity though so you need spread to hit a fast moving target
help 2020-11-19 18:48:04 well that's one sensor
help 2020-11-19 18:48:09 you choose the target you want
help 2020-11-19 18:48:15 and it follows it
help 2020-11-19 18:48:22 <@!698944372728791158>  that's possible
help 2020-11-19 18:48:37 ik how to do that
help 2020-11-19 18:48:38 no
help 2020-11-19 18:48:48 bruh
help 2020-11-19 18:48:53 pistons are only for input
help 2020-11-19 18:48:56 in A seat
help 2020-11-19 18:49:08 now to make it work
help 2020-11-19 18:49:25 you use the physics sleep time out
help 2020-11-19 18:49:34 for example
help 2020-11-19 18:49:38 you time out a part
help 2020-11-19 18:49:41 make it floating
help 2020-11-19 18:49:49 then when you get in proximity to that part
help 2020-11-19 18:49:51 it updates and falls
help 2020-11-19 18:49:59 now what can be used for a door
help 2020-11-19 18:50:13 that falls down and then closes after a bit with convayors
help 2020-11-19 18:50:21 you get near it
help 2020-11-19 18:50:25 I've done it before
help 2020-11-19 18:50:37 they are easy tbh
help 2020-11-19 18:50:44 the hard part is getting it in A sleep state
help 2020-11-19 18:50:55 but that's not to hard if you know how
help 2020-11-19 18:51:12 ask other people about it they will prob know how to do it.
help 2020-11-19 18:51:29 oh and the sleep state is only for non moving stuff
help 2020-11-19 18:51:43 so like boats that are anchored or buildings
help 2020-11-19 18:51:57 Just ask around prob everyone knows how it use it
help 2020-11-19 18:52:01 <@!698944372728791158>
help 2020-11-19 18:52:41 ask around
help 2020-11-19 18:52:55 on how to make proximity sensors

bot-central 2020-11-19 19:14:23 ?whois
help 2020-11-20 02:31:30 How do I make proximity sensors/motion sensors in pc  not detect stuff you don't want to be detected?
help 2020-11-20 02:33:28 Also when you make your motion/proximity sensors how do you make the downtime between activation's shorter?
help 2020-11-20 02:36:02 Add more motors to make a 2d folding point. That way it's much more strong.
help 2020-11-20 02:36:11 2 should be enough
help 2020-11-20 02:36:26 1 isn't enough for stuff that have to take A lot of load though
help 2020-11-20 02:43:48 <@!479305807674998804>  How can I make proximity sensors not detect stuff you don't want them to
help 2020-11-20 02:44:03 like when one sensor moves it triggers another sensor
help 2020-11-20 02:44:08 and that triggers another
help 2020-11-20 02:44:18 yes?
help 2020-11-20 02:44:40 it's not that hard to make them
help 2020-11-20 02:44:49 well you make them
help 2020-11-20 02:45:18 there should be a few yt videos on this but I haven't checked
help 2020-11-20 02:45:22 wait I should check
help 2020-11-20 02:45:29 that might answer my question
help 2020-11-20 02:47:36 I'll need to remake it
help 2020-11-20 02:47:49 you don't really need a pic though
help 2020-11-20 02:48:36 same
help 2020-11-20 02:48:38 that's wierd
help 2020-11-20 02:48:51 Honestly I think spacing out the sensors is the best option
help 2020-11-20 02:49:06 so they don't detect one another
help 2020-11-20 02:50:14 anyways I am still trying to make the motion sensors work on moving stuff
help 2020-11-20 02:50:26 cause rn they detect the moving stuff around them and activate
help 2020-11-20 02:51:03 I mean they are doing what they are meant to do....
help 2020-11-20 02:51:28 so technically it's not a glitch
help 2020-11-20 02:51:47 It's just that if they are on a plane and the plane moves they activate
help 2020-11-20 02:53:23 So idk how to solve that cause nothing is wrong with the sensors cause they are working as they where meant to.
help 2020-11-20 02:53:47 They are just literally doing what they are told to do and not what I want them to do.
help 2020-11-20 16:52:30 Anyways does anyone here know how to make motion/proximity sensors not activate when the object it's attached to start moving?
help 2020-11-20 16:53:59 No
help 2020-11-20 16:54:02 not hover thrusters
help 2020-11-20 16:54:21 this detects if something or some one moved closed to it
help 2020-11-20 16:54:34 And it can be hidden away and not seen
help 2020-11-20 16:54:51 Unlike hover thrusters
help 2020-11-20 16:55:14 Clearly not if I made them.
help 2020-11-20 16:56:19 what you guys haven't made that type of sensor??

help 2020-11-20 16:57:05 .
help 2020-11-20 16:57:12 Welp I guess I am on my own
help 2020-11-20 16:57:38 Anyways ty for trying to help me
help 2020-11-20 16:59:21 I can't use hover thrusters
help 2020-11-20 16:59:27 cause it needs to be hidden
help 2020-11-20 16:59:42 and I don't think hover thrusters can detect people
help 2020-11-20 17:00:07 Well I have them on sliding doors
help 2020-11-20 17:00:17 that drop when you get close to them automatically
help 2020-11-20 17:00:44 but the sensor can't be moved other wise it'll detect the movement of the sensor.
help 2020-11-20 17:02:03 no
help 2020-11-20 17:02:06 the sensor is made
help 2020-11-20 17:02:08 in pc
help 2020-11-20 17:02:13 it's not a part you can place
help 2020-11-20 17:02:19 it's made of many other parts
help 2020-11-20 17:02:44 no?
help 2020-11-20 17:02:51 it doesn't need to be touched
help 2020-11-20 17:03:01 .
help 2020-11-20 17:03:19 no
help 2020-11-20 17:03:29 hover thrusters can't be hidden
help 2020-11-20 17:03:45 they can't be hidden
help 2020-11-20 17:04:08 you can't hide a hover sensor inside A wall
help 2020-11-20 17:04:29 cause automatic sliding doors?
help 2020-11-20 17:04:45 that open and close when you get close to them
help 2020-11-20 17:04:55 well it's also for that
help 2020-11-20 17:05:34 but I just wanted to make a sliding door
help 2020-11-20 17:05:58 So I can add stuff to the computer as a finishing touch
help 2020-11-20 17:06:10 like usb ports that open when you get close to them to kinda "animate" the pc.
help 2020-11-20 17:08:46 tnemom hurb
help 2020-11-20 17:10:37 <@!716121757131735101>  0.9 block
help 2020-11-20 17:10:48 Or motor lock
help 2020-11-20 17:10:50 np
help 2020-11-20 17:14:08 You know wut I'll prob just use hover thrusters for now
help 2020-11-20 17:14:24 until I figure out how to be able to make the sensors move
help 2020-11-20 17:14:31 yeah
help 2020-11-20 17:15:04 but the issue with hover thrusters is that they can't amplify A force
help 2020-11-20 17:16:05 while the sensors I used can turn A walking force into A force about 100 ballast beams at max density falling.

help 2020-11-20 17:17:41 but that doesn't do much
help 2020-11-20 17:17:49 use ballast beams
help 2020-11-20 17:17:52 and helium
help 2020-11-20 17:18:01 just ballast beams will not work at all
help 2020-11-20 17:18:13 cause of the pendulum fallacy
help 2020-11-20 17:18:27 you need both ballast beams low and helium up high
help 2020-11-20 17:18:45 so?
help 2020-11-20 17:19:36 use helium...
help 2020-11-20 17:19:45 and ballast beams
help 2020-11-20 17:19:47 BRUH
help 2020-11-20 17:19:54 Use helium and ballast beams...
help 2020-11-20 17:20:04 YESSSSSSSSSs

wings in real life ain't that skinny
make the wing support/bars less thic

creations-chat 2020-12-08 22:14:32 When you try to take a picture of your creation to post in <#384025409945337856>  and it all goes to hell. <:kek:652566605028524033>
creations-chat 2020-12-08 22:24:03 I know right but the community did this to themselves. So we can't blame the mods.
creations-chat 2020-12-08 22:29:02 It makes me vomit when I look at it.

help 2020-12-11 19:47:01 How can I not think of how to make stuff smaller and more compact when building? I don't wanna think of how to make more compact stuff because when I find out how to make my computer part I am making more compact that makes it so I need to redo that entire part to make it even smaller. This makes making the computer that take forever to make , because remaking a part takes hours , and by the time I finish that new smaller part I already know how to make it even smaller, and it keeps on getting smaller and smaller and I never have the time to make other parts. I don't wanna just focus on just one part I wanna finish the entire computer not make a certain part extremely compact. Please help me.
help 2020-12-11 19:52:05 But when I know I can make it more compact I **have** to make it more compact. It's just a thing I must do and I can't stop myself from making it more compact. I can't get it off my mind unless I make it more compact.
help 2020-12-11 19:53:03 but like I remade the entire gpu 4 times
help 2020-12-11 19:53:20 that took me over a week
help 2020-12-11 19:53:32 but then I'll never be able to finish the computer
help 2020-12-11 19:53:39 cause I'll just be working on only one part
help 2020-12-11 19:54:35 It's like you made a build you though was very good but you realize you can make it way better and you just **have** to remake it to make it way better.
help 2020-12-11 19:56:08 but you can't make them all at once
help 2020-12-11 19:56:46 cause then you'll be wasting tons of space
help 2020-12-11 19:57:20 Now if you make them right next to each other with almost no gap then that's way more space efficient then guessing how much space a certain part will take, and space is **extreamly** valuable
help 2020-12-11 20:00:39 It's like how you need a computer chip to make a thing that makes computer chips but you don't have a computer chip to make the machine.
help 2020-12-11 20:01:44 It's a conundrum
help 2020-12-11 20:06:33 bruh I know how to make a computer
help 2020-12-11 20:06:35 I need to make it
help 2020-12-11 20:06:42 even the upgrades
help 2020-12-11 20:06:45 like the display
help 2020-12-11 20:07:01 that's my problem
help 2020-12-11 20:58:52 But really how do I not think about something I don't wanna thing about
help 2020-12-11 22:01:27 <@!547562883245015065>  rotate them
help 2020-12-11 22:01:31 you put them upside down
help 2020-12-11 22:47:32 Does anyone here know about computers that I chat about my ideas and maybe get some help from when I need help? 
(I know I know practically nothing about computers that's why I am asking) If so dm me. I will be about to respond in about 1.5 hours from now cause I gtg.
help 2020-12-12 00:16:34 Both look ugly if I where to be honest. I'd like you to use something other then wedges cause wedges aren't flat.
help 2020-12-12 00:17:58 Does anyone here know about how computers work and stuff? I wanna have someone that can give suggestions and have a different point of view on my ideas.
help 2020-12-12 00:20:16 why do people use the same tutorial tank track a lot
help 2020-12-12 00:20:57 or is it because that's the easiest to come up with so everyone comes up with the same exact track.
help 2020-12-12 00:23:10 well yes
help 2020-12-12 00:23:14 but don't use wedges for the tracks
help 2020-12-12 00:23:16 looks ugly
help 2020-12-12 00:23:26 use blocks
help 2020-12-12 00:23:36 cause wedges are a wedge and not a block
help 2020-12-12 00:23:40 .

help 2020-12-12 00:26:29 so 1 block is = to a few mm
help 2020-12-12 00:26:52 how do I know cause that's how roblox exports the obj's file size

the-dump 2021-05-26 00:34:13 True.
the-dump 2021-05-26 00:35:13 You say "The one on the left is better".
the-dump 2021-05-26 00:35:35 You're not saying that you like the one on the left, but you're saying it's better.

the-dump 2021-06-02 16:58:33 Use your finger.
the-dump 2021-06-02 19:25:14 Do not click. You will Regret it.
the-dump 2021-06-02 19:25:32 I know I did.
the-dump 2021-06-02 19:25:51 What part?
the-dump 2021-06-02 19:27:18 
the-dump 2021-06-02 19:27:18 
the-dump 2021-06-02 19:27:23 Binary computer.
the-dump 2021-06-02 19:27:41 It has 216 logic gates.
the-dump 2021-06-02 19:27:48 ?
the-dump 2021-06-02 19:28:05 The analogue computer was trash.
the-dump 2021-06-02 19:28:15 The binary?
the-dump 2021-06-02 19:29:05 That one is keyboard, with a cache, and binary to text encoder (GPU), with a 10 character screen.
the-dump 2021-06-02 19:29:15 It's slow af due to physics lag though.
the-dump 2021-06-02 19:29:38 That computer is ancient.
the-dump 2021-06-02 19:29:48 Like 4 months old.
the-dump 2021-06-02 19:29:54 I haven't tried.
the-dump 2021-06-02 19:30:00 It's Huge.
the-dump 2021-06-02 19:30:11 I already made faster versions.
the-dump 2021-06-02 19:30:38 
the-dump 2021-06-02 19:30:55 232 logic gates.
the-dump 2021-06-02 19:31:09 It's a combination circuit.
the-dump 2021-06-02 19:31:14 It's a gpu.
the-dump 2021-06-02 19:31:45 But I have a version that's even smaller.
the-dump 2021-06-02 19:31:55 2x smaller.
the-dump 2021-06-02 19:32:03 Well, I mean.
the-dump 2021-06-02 19:32:08 It's not 2x smaller.
the-dump 2021-06-02 19:32:13 It expands.
the-dump 2021-06-02 19:32:25 So it takes up 2x less space unexpanded.
the-dump 2021-06-02 19:32:35 But, you can expand it outside the plot.
the-dump 2021-06-02 19:32:57 And since it takes up 2x less space unexpanded you have more room for other circuits.
the-dump 2021-06-02 19:33:15 You cut out the middleman with the logic gates.
the-dump 2021-06-02 19:33:33 And make the circuit itself a logic gate.
the-dump 2021-06-02 19:33:48 That one doesn't have an ALU.
the-dump 2021-06-02 19:33:55 ALU are easy.
the-dump 2021-06-02 19:34:14 Addition, subtraction.
the-dump 2021-06-02 19:34:20 In another version*
the-dump 2021-06-02 19:34:51 Transcribing
the-dump 2021-06-02 19:35:05 Yes.
the-dump 2021-06-02 19:35:27 I should make a even smaller version.
the-dump 2021-06-02 19:35:35 Give me a few weeks.
the-dump 2021-06-02 19:36:13 Analogue aimbot was trash.
the-dump 2021-06-02 19:36:26 I didn't show it, because I was trying to fix some of it's jamming problems.
the-dump 2021-06-02 19:36:35 And I made up every excuse to not show it. So I had time to fix it.
the-dump 2021-06-02 19:36:51 But In the end I couldn't make it jam less.
the-dump 2021-06-02 19:36:58 So I gave up on it.
the-dump 2021-06-02 19:37:06 idk if I still have it.
the-dump 2021-06-02 19:37:47 let me check.
the-dump 2021-06-02 19:39:30 I don't have it anymore.
the-dump 2021-06-02 19:39:34 I can put it on my to do list though to make it again.
the-dump 2021-06-02 19:41:56 Physics lag won't help this.
the-dump 2021-06-02 19:42:26 It's about 2k parts frame, and the rest of the parts are all moving.
the-dump 2021-06-02 19:42:41 Cause it's better.
the-dump 2021-06-02 19:42:54 Less mistakes.

the-dump 2021-06-02 19:44:48 This is sheet.
the-dump 2021-06-02 19:44:53 It's just a rotary encoder.
the-dump 2021-06-02 19:44:58 It has like 0 logic in it.
the-dump 2021-06-02 19:45:13 I mean, It does have some, but it's legit very easy to make.
the-dump 2021-06-02 19:45:32 A 7 year old can make that, and yet it has so many.
the-dump 2021-06-02 19:45:44 It's a cool thing, but idk why it got so many.

the-dump 2021-06-15 14:06:08 Just don't act all entitled about being that, and you should be fine. Being gay doesn't make you special, or give you special privlages.
the-dump 2021-06-15 14:06:29 Oh, ok lol.
the-dump 2021-06-15 14:08:00 LOL
the-dump 2021-06-15 18:30:47 I will leak pee.
the-dump 2021-06-15 18:53:32 Idk abotu what happened, but she probably didn't stop.
the-dump 2021-06-15 18:53:47 I need the full video to tell.
the-dump 2021-06-15 18:55:40 Both of them were wrong from what I can tell.
the-dump 2021-06-15 19:02:05 Ik, but the video cuts out parts.
the-dump 2021-06-15 19:02:16 So from that video it's a he said/she said.
the-dump 2021-06-15 19:02:41 That's why I said from what I can see.
the-dump 2021-06-15 19:02:52 Here.
the-dump 2021-06-15 19:02:58 What's it called?
the-dump 2021-06-15 19:03:49 Ty.
the-dump 2021-06-15 19:05:29 The woman had ~100 seconds to pull over.
the-dump 2021-06-15 19:06:12 I'll say this, I have no idea about anything I'm saying, and it's all speculation.
the-dump 2021-06-15 19:06:58 What did she do?
the-dump 2021-06-15 19:07:08 Wanna take this to dms?
the-dump 2021-06-15 19:07:30 Ok.
the-dump 2021-06-15 19:07:35 Then we can't make any judgment.
the-dump 2021-06-15 19:07:44 We need to hear both sides.
the-dump 2021-06-15 19:07:58 For all we know she could be a bank robber. (Very doubtful though).
the-dump 2021-06-15 19:08:06 And if she was it would be somewhat justified.
the-dump 2021-06-15 19:08:44 It's a habit of mine.
the-dump 2021-06-15 19:11:27 This isn't politics.
the-dump 2021-06-15 19:11:58 It's just discussing if someone is right.
the-dump 2021-06-15 19:13:08 Ok, then I'd say that the cop was in the wrong, BUT we need to let the cop defend his point, and let him say his side of the story before we can know for sure.

the-dump 2021-06-15 19:19:24 Ik.
the-dump 2021-06-15 19:19:52 Me personally, I'm on the right, so I detest socialism, but I don't want to get political.

the-dump 2021-06-16 00:11:41 Sad video though.

the-dump 2021-06-16 04:44:58 What were the songs? From what I remember you have good taste.
the-dump 2021-06-16 19:09:00 
the-dump 2021-06-16 19:20:15 The Germans wanted to make the Luftwaffe (German Airforce) look bigger than it really was via bluffing, so when the fake airbase was discovered, the allies probably (and I'm speculating here) didn't want to waste real bombs on the fake airbase, so they dropped wooden bombs to show that they noticed that it was a fake airbase and maybe as a joke.
the-dump 2021-06-16 19:20:47 Wdym?
