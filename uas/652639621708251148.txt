creations-chat 2020-11-23 21:50:50 it was completely fine a couple hours ago. and this is what the motor settings are

creations-chat 2021-01-01 04:00:51 ah yes i love some bypass from someone who thinks a moderator is teaching them.
bug-reports 2021-01-21 23:54:17 oh good
bug-reports 2021-01-21 23:54:20 you guys are having that too
bug-reports 2021-01-21 23:54:27 i thought it was my plane
bug-reports 2021-01-21 23:54:55 i think roblox updated motors and screwed it up
creations-chat 2021-03-08 05:54:41 I decided to restart my su-27 since my last one got 23 downvotes, how is it looking so far?
creations-chat 2021-03-08 06:41:45 let me emphesize the fact i said ***so far***
creations-chat 2021-03-24 07:30:52 oh ok, you dont get warned but i do, thats fair ok sure, and sorry, i didnt mean to post it in that channel. just saying we all make mistakes.
creations-chat 2021-03-24 07:33:01 so you just figured out what a joke is
creations-chat 2021-03-24 07:35:09 honestly im just gonna leave this server eventually due to how toxic people can get over a simple mistake i make.
creations-chat 2021-03-24 07:44:29 look, i dont give a shit about some tiny mistake i made. just leave me alone and stop bringing a tiny problem into a huge problem
creations-chat 2021-03-24 07:46:36 so im not allowed to tell someone to stop? and im not trying to victimize myself, im not some desperate 5 year old seeking for attention.
creations-chat 2021-03-24 07:48:39 this is the one thing im asking. got it? **leave me alone.** i dont even see what your point is here, i admit i made a mistake. what else do you want
creations-chat 2021-03-24 08:22:16 <@!738702049113538600> read rule one. and you tell me to read the rules.
creations-chat 2021-03-24 08:24:21 remember when you pinged me and told me to read the rules? made fun of my build over a joke? started this entire argument? exactly, read rule one. thats all i gotta say
creations-chat 2021-03-24 08:28:37 "1: BE CIVIL AND USE COMMON SENSE
Please be nice to others and use common sense! Do not harass, bully, threaten or berate other members. You are expected to be respectful to everyone at all times. General toxicity will be met with a ban."
creations-chat 2021-03-24 08:30:53 just explaining to this guy the first rule
creations-chat 2021-03-24 08:33:49 tell me what this is
creations-chat 2021-03-24 08:35:55 that was like a year ago, you know also some people can get crushed when they get downvotes on their build. and you know, hey, atleast they tried.
creations-chat 2021-03-24 08:37:59 what if i just wanna remake it as a **J O K E** that you guys clearly dont get
creations-chat 2021-03-24 08:40:23 look at what you said before this and then look at what i said, i isnt a joke NOW, it always has been a joke during this argument
creations-chat 2021-03-24 08:42:24 if you dont get it stop dragging this argument along and shut the fuck up.
creations-chat 2021-03-24 08:44:26 since when did i say its from real life?
creations-chat 2021-03-24 08:46:33 oh my god i didnt even mean to post it in creations. thats why i deleted that post
creations-chat 2021-03-24 08:48:35 i can explain it in dms where theres no slowmode, or maybe a group
creations-chat 2021-03-24 08:51:32 ok, ill just say it here, i did not start it, it did not start over downvotes. and anyways i dont give a shit about downvotes anyways. it started by me posting a WIP post in creations on ACCIDENT while i meant to do it in feedback to see if i could get some improvements, and now we are here
creations-chat 2021-03-24 08:53:48 holy shit for the love of god i dont care about a nearly year old post, plus that thing was trash anyways. and now ive learned the nature of this server. if you make a little mistake you get a whole argument.
creations-chat 2021-03-24 08:56:15 what else am i supposed to do? let myself get bullied? yeah check rule one for me. no wonder this always happens its like the god damn bot runs everthing here. we have nobody who actually cares to look at the arguments and do something about them.
creations-chat 2021-03-24 08:58:21 maybe i am sensitive, maybe i can get bullied, maybe i SHOULD get bullied, maybe i do deserve this, maybe my builds do suck, maybe everyone does hate me, maybe everyone talks about me, maybe im the one who started it, maybe i dont matter, maybe making mistakes is a terrible thing.
creations-chat 2021-03-24 09:00:55 does this sound like a good thing? ive lost all self confidence all to you guys. answer my question
creations-chat 2021-03-24 09:02:56 what "FEEDBACK" are you talking about? huh? all i meant to do was post my build and try to get some real help to optimize my building skills.
creations-chat 2021-03-24 09:05:10 so what are you asking for now? ive wrapped up my side, and sending that gif is just asking for more. and <@!720891502108344360> thats exactly what i was trying to do. im literally just saying, sending that gif, is asking for more
creations-chat 2021-03-25 03:11:17 actually my friend did
bug-reports 2021-03-26 21:44:44 ah yes.
bug-reports 2021-03-26 21:45:09 it isnt a visual glitch either
bug-reports 2021-03-26 21:45:15 when i place blocks it changes
bug-reports 2021-03-26 21:45:21 and delete them it goes back
bug-reports 2021-03-26 21:45:54 pretty annoying for moving your build
creations-chat 2021-04-14 23:04:17 i wonder what the most upvoted build in <#384025409945337856> is
creations-chat 2021-04-14 23:07:25 first sceenshot, TECHNICALLY is a build.
creations-chat 2021-08-26 22:05:59 <@!533551814185058304> im pretty sure your boat is called a dinghy
creations-chat 2022-11-25 02:29:22 why do my creations get deleted in <#384025409945337856>
creations-chat 2022-11-25 02:31:54 I tried to post a mechanism that i uploaded to streamable and it got deleted a second after
