<@456226577798135808> do not think anything bad, but the colors on your cammo for the 29th instant are too painful to the eye (my opinion) try to lighten the black color
creations-chat 2020-11-27 21:38:14 lighten up a little more

creations-chat 2020-11-29 18:53:50 guys, how can I get a certain rank, in multiples I don't know English well and the translator doesn't really translate what is written by the admins and I can't figure it out
creations-chat 2020-12-05 17:20:12 <@456226577798135808> can you upload a photo?
creations-chat 2020-12-05 17:22:22 Oh, no, I found it myself.
I didn't like your harier because you have an irregular cabin shape, no camouflage, and in itself it is some simple...
creations-chat 2020-12-05 17:25:05 no problem, I respect people like you who accept their mistakes and correct them, and do not start shouting that they are right
creations-chat 2020-12-09 14:53:02 Not bad!

by the way it sounds like racism!

creations-chat 2020-12-18 14:32:39 What?
creations-chat 2020-12-18 14:43:16 because it is ugly and its tower does not match the original
creations-chat 2020-12-19 21:07:59 this is not me who built it, i ask that the person who built it be banned
creations-chat 2020-12-19 21:10:18 what? but why? this is not my building... where is the logic here?
creations-chat 2020-12-19 21:25:19 thank you, at least someone is on my side
creations-chat 2020-12-19 21:27:20 does it make sense to write a report on it? rickje139 said it does not accept complaints
creations-chat 2020-12-19 21:29:21 Oh, my God! What's wrong with you Americans? i wanted to show everyone who does it! I'm not the author of the building, I just took a screenshot!!
creations-chat 2020-12-22 08:48:38 Emm... ladies and gentlemen, I didn't think this would happen, but... I need your help, I don't have enough space for the back of the ship, to be more precise "height"
what to do?!
creations-chat 2020-12-22 08:59:32 I don't think... there is very little space on the upper levels, at the very bottom there is a nose and there is still something to build that I do not see the point
probably it will be necessary to remove the buildingüòî
creations-chat 2020-12-22 09:23:15 not quite
creations-chat 2020-12-22 11:03:27 I agree that it is not visible well and that's what I highlighted as it does not fit into the building itself, if you can, attach the original photo
creations-chat 2020-12-22 11:07:58 to accurately determine the color, use this site, upload a photo-choose a color - you are given an RGB code

creations-chat 2020-12-27 13:32:33 I can throw a screenshot of my desktop so that you understand that I am Russian (as proof)
creations-chat 2020-12-27 13:45:01 lol did you think I could use a translator?
creations-chat 2020-12-27 13:52:35 Yes, BUT! in Russian, I spoke with you only in private messages, and not on this server (correction, on this server I said that... "–í–æ–æ–±—â–µ-—Ç–æ
—è –¥–µ–π—Å—Ç–≤–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω–æ –Ω–µ –∑–Ω–∞—é –∞–Ω–≥–ª–∏–π—Å–∫–∏–π" which translates to: I really don't know English
creations-chat 2020-12-27 13:56:04 throw me a screenshot of where I spoke Russian here (on this server), except where I said I don't understand English
creations-chat 2020-12-27 14:01:33 can you send a screenshot of where I was speaking in Russian here? in addition to the message where I said that I do not understand English, if not then that's it! the conflict is over.
creations-chat 2020-12-27 14:54:40 the cabin is not very well made and so the phantom is good
creations-chat 2021-01-16 20:39:02 the building is not like a mirage
creations-chat 2021-01-16 21:52:59 the color is too black (not racist -_-)
creations-chat 2021-01-16 21:55:03 I don't know if there are "GENIUSES" who will consider this racist
creations-chat 2021-01-18 17:51:14 <@!719168864705052802> what's wrong with my phantoms?
creations-chat 2021-01-18 17:55:52 Yeah... give a bad rating to the building, because it has already been posted many times before me... the logic is definitely there, but only female. -_-
creations-chat 2021-01-18 17:59:04 nooo... oh my God... - _ - this was a joke understandable only to the Russian-speaking part of the community...
creations-chat 2021-01-22 13:34:29 the tower and the trunk of your centurion are ugly, + there is no camouflage (camouflage helps in such cases) P.S. no offense, buddy.
creations-chat 2021-01-22 13:38:33 if this is such a joke, then it is out of place, and if you are serious, then yes, I agree... but he asked me why I didn't like his building and I told him why... if he does something, then the building should be similar to the real prototype in everything, not just in name...
creations-chat 2021-01-22 13:45:33 you didn't understand... -_-
you didn't build it well - it doesn't look like a prototype...
creations-chat 2021-02-04 13:50:21 Listen @CrystalHeisenberg, you've got a very good eagle! but the engines... engines are trouble... they do not fit your building at all, try to redo them somehow)

creations-chat 2021-02-06 15:26:28 don't you understand? can you explain?
creations-chat 2021-02-06 15:31:15 why?
creations-chat 2021-02-06 15:36:03 Okay, thanks.
creations-chat 2021-02-12 14:19:21 comrades! how can I make my plane not tilt its nose when flying, it needs to be stabilized, but how? helium, bestami or something else? who has any ideas.
creations-chat 2021-02-12 15:00:20 Hey bro, what's the problem? Yes, our planes are similar but I have f-1 but not T-2 and camouflage didn't want to do the original because I liked camo T-2. Yes, our buildings similar but it's 2 different aircraft kotoryi life not much different. ._.
(no offense)
creations-chat 2021-02-12 15:04:35 in real life, this is the same plane, only the Mitsubishi T-2 is a combat training fighter,and the F-1 is a combat one. The F-1 is a converted T-2.
creations-chat 2021-02-12 15:08:18 ok I will not argue with you, I will delete this building, but I just want to convey to you that I did not try to copy someone else's plane just the combat prototypes they have the same : \
creations-chat 2021-02-12 15:10:46 but I don't understand why you need it. : \
creations-chat 2021-02-12 15:14:05 really?
if you're talking about orange
creations-chat 2021-02-12 15:18:26 yes, but only the color palette in photoshop and in the game differ greatly... I checked more than once._.
creations-chat 2021-02-12 15:22:08 I won't even try to explain
anything to you because if you wanted to you would have heard me instead of sitting in your own separate world : \
creations-chat 2021-02-14 19:58:18 I didn't try to make it fully detailed, because when I would redo my hornet, I wanted to make it in a different way (it was just an " attempt")
creations-chat 2021-02-14 20:00:21 don't you understand? can you explain?
thanks
creations-chat 2021-02-14 20:29:13 oo no, this is just a test version of the hornet, I came up with this camouflage and decals, too, in convenient places for myself, I want to understand how the players will accept it, exactly how I built it...
maybe it's strange to do so... But I did üôÇ
creations-chat 2021-02-22 17:17:53 I understand that this is custom, but the wings are very large and personally they catch my eye : \
creations-chat 2021-02-22 17:22:21 (em... the translator does not translate well)
the su 27 has wings of a completely different shape, they are not so wide
creations-chat 2021-02-22 17:26:07 Yes, I know... but I'm just saying what catches my eye...
and maybe I misunderstood his message, because the translator does not translate well : \
creations-chat 2021-02-22 17:42:58 guys throw some camouflage for the f 18
preferably with a minimum number of inscriptions
creations-chat 2021-02-22 17:47:40 
creations-chat 2021-02-25 15:52:37 this is su 33 right?
creations-chat 2021-02-25 15:55:38 and if the custom is good, I thought it was su 33 and put downvote because the engines are like f 15
my bad sorry
creations-chat 2021-03-02 11:34:10 <@!383636858275495936>  can I ask you what you didn't like about my impala?
creations-chat 2021-03-02 12:07:17 and who has any ideas on how to make rims for my impala? there cylinders 2x2x2 and cylinders 1x1 somehow do not look very good : \
creations-chat 2021-03-02 12:11:41 I didn't try it, the image is too small.
creations-chat 2021-03-02 12:15:49 ammm... y-yeeees?

creations-chat 2021-03-02 12:44:19 thank you sweet<:thoink:657279634563399720>
creations-chat 2021-03-02 12:53:53 wait... what?! NO!

creations-chat 2021-03-02 16:47:15 Yes, I already understood, I'm working on it, I will soon show the result)
creations-chat 2021-03-03 09:49:32 <@456226577798135808> what didn't you like about my impala?
creations-chat 2021-03-03 09:54:17 I can't do it any other way
creations-chat 2021-03-03 10:08:58 ++++
creations-chat 2021-03-07 15:18:06 all... from the mirage there is only the name, it is absolutely not like the original
do not be offended..
creations-chat 2021-03-07 15:36:59 I meant " not like a real mirage"
creations-chat 2021-03-07 15:44:26 you just don't have much experience yet
creations-chat 2021-03-27 12:49:11 <:MyDolphinIsntWorking:552912733008429081>
creations-chat 2021-03-27 13:02:43 and I got there unfairly. . _ .
creations-chat 2021-03-27 13:13:33 Really? copied it. look carefully at my moment and at "the one that I allegedly copied" (did not copy) look closely at them and you will understand that they are very different. hump, rudders, tail, shape of the wings and the height at which they are located... of the similar ones, we have only the cabin and the nose. but I couldn't do them any other way, so I had to do them like this. as for your Mitsubishi t2 I made it a combat version of the F1 they have a difference only in the cockpit :\
creations-chat 2021-03-27 13:17:31 tendency seriously? dude... sometimes it happens that two builders can build similar buildings, but think about it... if I copied AND SO THAT IT IS VISIBLE (sorry for the caps) then would I lay out such a building? knowing that I copied it and knowing that I can get banned for it?
creations-chat 2021-03-27 13:21:01 I don't want to argue either... but now, because you did not look closely at my building, you accused me of copying and I am threatened with a BAN for this. I didn't copy it, though... seriously, man... Do you think I like people who copy other people's buildings? as proof, you can ask the player ZasSno he is my friend, and he can confirm that I do not copy other people's buildings... : /
creations-chat 2021-03-27 13:23:20 smfh?? I do not know English, can I explain what this means?
creations-chat 2021-03-27 13:48:22 thanks for the explanation
