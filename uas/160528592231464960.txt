bug-reports 2020-05-13 13:54:21 Is the bug fixed where the control surfaces will get flipped randomly if they don't have a set key bind but are just mouse controlled?
bug-reports 2020-08-26 22:24:40 for some odd reason on my boat that im making it only carrys 2 missiles rn that I have made the first one works perfectly but the second ones control surfaces are flipped, when I point up it thinks im pointing left and when I point down it thinks im pointing right, this bug is super anoying when trying to make missiles.
bug-reports 2020-08-26 22:26:38 no my missiles are mouse guided as I plan to have 3 of them
bug-reports 2020-08-26 22:26:44 and it makes it easyer to aim
bug-reports 2020-11-02 10:21:32 by rockets dont work, u mean that your mech has rockets that allows it to fly or, like pvp rockets

creations-chat 2020-12-26 23:50:20 i tried to make a joke but slow down mode stopped me dam it
creations-chat 2020-12-26 23:53:42 also the devs should allow it so other peoples builds dont fall off of peoples vehicles when the persons vehicle starts moving so we can have aircraft carriers with a purpose....oh wait nvm they still dont have a purpose as land is just a yard away
creations-chat 2020-12-26 23:56:06 also why do devs like keeping glitches in the game
creations-chat 2020-12-26 23:59:17 ok but what if theres a glitch that can destroy the game
help 2021-03-10 15:16:36 hey are convayer engines classed as illegal in plane crazy cause ik that lagg switch isnt allow in plane crazy but is convayer engines and magnet engines allowed

help 2021-03-10 15:22:10 as there are no engines that can push the sound barrier
help 2021-03-10 15:22:22 unless 600 speed = 770mph
help 2021-03-10 15:23:55 hover engines is a quick way to get to 600 speed but can go any higher than that

bug-reports 2021-07-13 17:55:08 I just had this happen to me, and it happend when someone despawned as the server died, like I was still in the server its just no else can use the plot
bug-reports 2021-11-03 13:37:44 theres a bug where 2 people can share the same plot
bug-reports 2021-11-03 13:38:54 its annoying bug as you both share the same building space and can box the guy in
bug-reports 2021-11-03 13:41:26 proof of its existance
bug-reports 2021-11-03 13:41:54 the guy on the car thing own the car thing and the boat belongs to the guy in the back
bug-reports 2021-11-24 17:36:39 some servers I go to dont shoot the red bullets on the gun
bug-reports 2021-11-24 19:25:17 yeh but they dont do damage the red bullets do damage
bug-reports 2021-11-24 19:25:54 the yellow ones are more of tracers for the person using them
bug-reports 2021-11-24 19:26:52 which is weird as they do damage for the people using them but the people that they are shooting at dont see any damage
bug-reports 2021-11-24 19:27:43 did he see any damages
bug-reports 2021-11-24 19:28:04 because I shot at people and they shot at me but we couldnt see any bullets but our own
bug-reports 2021-11-24 19:28:32 and they didnt do any damage but the people who shot could only see damage on there screen
bug-reports 2021-11-24 19:28:38 yeh
bug-reports 2021-11-24 19:28:49 thats what I said
bug-reports 2021-11-24 19:29:10 also yellow being client side damage doesnt make sence
bug-reports 2021-11-24 19:29:24 as yellow does 5 times more damage than the red
bug-reports 2021-11-24 19:29:34 but doesnt effect builds on server side
bug-reports 2021-11-24 19:30:15 hmm yeh
bug-reports 2021-11-28 10:27:21 yep same here
bug-reports 2021-11-28 10:28:20 its annoying as I saved a build not noticing that my event items were missing
bug-reports 2022-01-13 17:23:00 mouse guided control surfaces dont work correctly on the water.
Description: so I have this ship that can fire a missile, this missile uses control surfaces that are mouse guided. For some reason if I spawn it on the water, the guidance becomes inverted, but when I use it on land the guidance is normal.
Steps to reproduce Bug: Just make a missile with mouse guided control surfaces on the water and you will see the bug for yourself, if it works for you then try adding a motor and disconnector to the missile as thats what I have attached to my missile
bug-reports 2022-01-13 17:42:21 ah ok sorry didnt see it in the pin messages
bug-reports 2022-03-27 00:02:48 I want to know if this is a roblox bug or a plane crazy bug, but non of the song ID's are working on the gamepass speaker
bug-reports 2022-06-28 23:55:45 small little problem with motor lock people been using it to get inside the map itself and make turrets in there, might want to fix it for the second game
bug-reports 2022-06-28 23:56:49 I would show an image of it underground but its hard to snap that sort of image
bug-reports 2022-06-28 23:57:16 so the build I screen shot, can go into the map, where you cant go because theres nothing in there
bug-reports 2022-06-28 23:57:26 and the people just build turrets in der
bug-reports 2022-06-28 23:58:23 not exactly it also uses that 1 thing where you can lagswitch
bug-reports 2022-06-28 23:58:35 without that it gets yeeted out
bug-reports 2022-06-28 23:59:35 it maybe smart but I can see it being annoying, think of other things people can make that goes inside of the map itself
bug-reports 2022-06-29 00:00:33 its annoying to some well as how can you kill it its in the ground
bug-reports 2022-06-29 00:01:37 motor locking isnt the bug its the going into that map I already know thats a feature
bug-reports 2022-06-29 00:02:21 so your saying to me if I built an entire base complex into the map its not a bug
bug-reports 2022-06-29 00:02:41 people called bunkers in airports a glitch?
bug-reports 2022-06-29 00:03:38 im tired and it took me 10 secs to realise
bug-reports 2022-07-21 18:31:49 question did you have a hyper engine on that plane and if yes was there 2 of them side by side(by hyper engine I mean conveyor engine or Magnet engine)
bug-reports 2022-08-04 19:27:35 for some odd reason I cant turn off the smoke pipe even if I change its keybind
bug-reports 2022-08-04 19:29:45 not only that but the trail is also not turning on I also turned on and off particles multiple times and nothing works
bug-reports 2022-08-04 19:36:57 on only happened on this 1 server I was on when I switched servers it works again
bug-reports 2022-11-09 01:22:04 yeh its very annoying, wanted to go on pvp before going to bed but looks like im not doing that now
bug-reports 2022-11-09 01:22:49 is it just the pvp servers
bug-reports 2022-11-09 01:22:52 or is it both
bug-reports 2022-11-09 01:23:34 odd wonder what caused it to happen if its only effecting 1 server
bug-reports 2022-11-09 01:29:33 wonder how long it will take for them to fix the issue
bug-reports 2022-11-09 12:36:16 dam been 12 hours still not fixed
