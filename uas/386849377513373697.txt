creations-chat 2022-04-30 16:15:05 ðŸ§¢
creations-chat 2022-04-30 16:18:21 really aggressive for someone who is "innocent"
id either admit to it being a tutorial, or post a build mode screenshot if you are that confident it isnt
creations-chat 2022-04-30 16:23:42 it is - go to 17:09 in https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eSSoKwrIfWo
the camera placement and body shape is uncanny
his body is slightly longer than the tutorial, but that doesnt mean its an original build
creations-chat 2022-04-30 16:29:59 tis but roblox physics
not really much you can do
maybe try engines to reverse the roll?

I think it did fairly well in creations compared to a lot of other builds, but I would still like to improve and clearly just asking for feedback in the creations message isnt enough lma
creations-chat 2022-05-03 15:18:47 wow completely ignored <:nooo:787097964946259978>
