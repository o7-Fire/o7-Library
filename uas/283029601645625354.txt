help 2021-08-05 16:10:54 quick question, <#609442446249820211> states "total score", does that mean a build with 21 likes and 16 dislikes gets a total score of 5?
help 2021-08-05 16:11:21 aight thanks

creations-chat 2021-08-05 16:30:05 attempt to be historically accurate
creations-chat 2021-08-05 16:34:41 so i posted another ship
creations-chat 2021-08-05 16:42:53 yeah i realize, it's whatever
creations-chat 2021-08-05 16:48:34 
creations-chat 2021-08-05 16:58:10 Thanks, yeah was thinking about motor locking wing parts to make it smoother, still technically wip but posted anyway. Yes, grav cannon can be deployed and pulled back into the hull (with effort, super laggy). Working on more fog ships rn E *cough fog yamato*
creations-chat 2021-08-05 17:47:01 thank you
creations-chat 2021-08-05 21:23:04 yes turorial big funny

creations-chat 2021-09-26 03:57:28 funny paint scheme
creations-chat 2021-09-26 18:25:54 wip falken, thoughts? (super thrusters in the back are temporary, just wanted to see how well it would fly in this state)
help 2021-09-26 18:29:50 aight so this build of mine has angled wing panels to make the shape of the nose, but as a result there's a severe uncontrollable yaw. ive had this issue before and couldn't figure out how to fix it without removing the angled panels entirely. any ideas?
help 2021-09-26 18:30:16 <#504436696021204992>
help 2021-09-26 18:34:10 tested and found out even without the angled panels it still has an uncontrollable yaw reeeee
creations-chat 2021-09-26 18:34:59 what is that plane supposed to be
creations-chat 2021-09-26 18:39:36 leading edge of wings needs to be more angled, the wings in general are poorly shaped and quite a bit big, they need to be moved back along with the vertical stabilizers and the elevators. paint scheme also needs work, and the body of the aircraft in general is a bit fat

at the end of the day it's your choice, im not saying you should delete and restart but you can if you want to
help 2021-09-26 18:47:13 funny thing is my plane is much more stable yaw wise when flying backwards
help 2021-09-26 18:47:54 too much effort
help 2021-09-26 18:48:38 not what im going for
help 2021-09-26 18:48:46 i need this thing to be stable flying forwards
help 2021-09-26 18:51:48 figured out a solution on my own, no need for help anymore E
creations-chat 2021-09-26 18:52:45 did you see a mess of motor locks when it was despawned?
creations-chat 2021-09-26 18:55:37 it's the falken not the raven so no ðŸ˜”
lol all good
creations-chat 2021-09-26 19:39:59 the black circles on my plane are emojis, so i guess yeah you can find emojis through searching google

idk i forgot, just look up a website on google for copy paste emojis
creations-chat 2021-09-28 01:59:06 <@!721908663694131281> man im working on a falken yours looks 10x better than mine lmaoo
creations-chat 2021-09-28 02:02:30 https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/504436696021204992/891752458882273301 oof

good build btw, like it a lot even if it doens't perform well enough for you
still though that's like insignificant considering the rest of your build
creations-chat 2021-09-28 02:07:36 idk how i feel now, might work on another different AC aircraft lmao
was originally thinking about posting mine once i finished E
creations-chat 2021-09-28 02:09:45 I was originally thinking about making the CFA, might be worth a shot
still might post my falken tho, it's gonna take like another week to figure out the engines anyway
creations-chat 2021-09-28 02:12:36 https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/384021699466756107/757226532048601119 i don't think im good enough to beat that ngl

R-101 Delphinus from Electrosphere?

XR45 looks nice, ill keep that in mind
creations-chat 2021-09-28 02:16:03 ooo also a good one, keeping that one in mind as well lmao

thanks for the ideas guys
creations-chat 2021-09-28 02:32:23 of course
creations-chat 2021-09-28 02:35:21 second dislike oof
expected, still sad ngl
creations-chat 2021-10-05 00:32:35 oof
creations-chat 2021-10-05 02:59:38 ok
creations-chat 2021-10-10 02:11:17 can't you zoom out while deployed and get the same thing without the jetpack particles

do you have a ton of accessories that stick out when you're in the build?
