help 2022-07-27 22:25:32 before the shredder era they where a respected build

help 2022-07-27 22:25:47 Yes.
help 2022-07-27 22:26:14 i was around when shredders became a thing and they where respected until toxic new ppl started making armies of the bugs

help 2022-07-27 22:26:25 true
help 2022-07-27 22:26:58 i honestly dont care for shredders
