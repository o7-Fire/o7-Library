bug-reports 2022-04-20 19:22:55 I'm not sure if this has been reported yet but there's a glitch in Plane Crazy I first experienced a few months ago, where your vehicle disappears for 1-2 seconds then reappears, but you can't control it, and it's like there's no wings, or propulsion. It's not extremely common and can be fixed by respawning your build but its annoying

help 2022-06-05 03:09:58 Is it just me or does the render distance to see the whole map seem to go up by 2 graphics each month
help 2022-06-05 03:10:54 because before I could see the whole map with just 5 graphics, and on 2020 I could see it with 3. Now I have to use 8
creations-chat 2022-06-25 02:13:54 yes
also why tf is cooldown so long
creations-chat 2022-06-25 02:18:08 the reason we have 2000 of almost anything is because the higher forces are trying to test how good we can build
and that explains the small plots
motor locking was intentional
they just wanted us to find it
