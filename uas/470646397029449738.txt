help 2021-01-06 01:02:48 what do I do if my plane keeps flipping backwards after lift off?
help 2021-01-06 01:07:08 What do I do to add weight?
help 2021-01-06 01:07:34 k, thx
help 2021-01-06 01:07:56 Alright, thanks
help 2021-01-06 01:09:31 one more question: what do ballast blocks do?
help 2021-01-06 01:11:40 But when I tried them it didn't help
help 2021-01-06 01:12:23 Yeah ik, they still didn't work
help 2021-01-06 01:12:29 I'll try them again
help 2021-01-06 01:13:14 Alr I'll try them now, because my front is too heavy
help 2021-01-06 01:16:24 Do ballast blocks add weight to the middle or weight to where you place them?
help 2021-01-06 01:17:08 alright
help 2021-01-06 01:17:12 They're working a bit
help 2021-01-06 01:20:20 It seems you were dropped in the pot of bitch as a child
help 2021-01-06 01:34:29 would a ballast block work?
help 2021-01-06 01:34:40 because it's not working for me
help 2021-01-06 01:35:46 can I send you a video of what's happening?
help 2021-01-06 01:35:55 to see if you know what the problem is?

help 2021-01-06 01:38:23 Is there anyone else I can ask, I just really want to complete my first nice plane
help 2021-01-06 01:41:53 No I didn't just start
help 2021-01-06 01:42:09 But all my planes looked bad, only now have I gotten better at designing
help 2021-01-06 01:42:23 I haven't played in a while though so I forgot what everything means
help 2021-01-06 01:43:16 yes ik how
help 2021-01-06 01:43:25 But I have never done it
help 2021-01-06 01:44:05 I'm not really trying to make it look nice I just want to know how it can fly

help 2021-01-06 02:00:24 I tried bigger wings it didn't help
help 2021-01-06 02:00:38 Made it worse in fact

help 2021-01-06 02:12:35 and falling to I'll add some hellium
help 2021-01-06 02:15:28 I added helium but now the side that was dropping is floating too high
help 2021-01-06 02:19:28 how?
help 2021-01-06 02:19:34 I only added one block
help 2021-01-06 02:19:50 and it didn't give me the option to remove
help 2021-01-06 02:19:58 other than removing the block of course
