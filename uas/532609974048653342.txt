creations-chat 2019-09-22 18:57:34 context: idea for small player driven planes that attach to a big mothership, the rockets are for stabilizing into the locks. there would be 2 up and down on the finished design, and the rockets you see will go into holes locking them in place and letting the pilot stand up (big brain)

creations-chat 2019-12-24 12:10:05 early prototype of a railgun, probally been done before better but it's my first attempt at one
creations-chat 2019-12-24 12:10:31 let me fix this
creations-chat 2019-12-24 12:13:11 here is what it looks like, if you trust me enough to download the roblox file you'll see it fires backwards, here is just an early prototype of it
creations-chat 2019-12-24 14:08:37 more force would need a longer barrel and also it fires the wrong way so it can't hit all the magnets in it's run
