help 2023-02-20 21:43:38 ok, so i made a mini f14 with a help from a friend a while back and i have no control whatsoever when i fly it, it tilts to the left but i checked through the motor lock heavily and i don’t know what to do, it’s my first build in like 2 months so i don’t remember all the things to fix it
help 2023-02-20 21:50:23 some reason it won’t let me upload video
