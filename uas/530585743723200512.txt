 Hey   , “SEND THIS TO ALL THE SERVERS YOU ARE IN. This is IMPORTANT: Do not accept a friend request from juan.#6924  He is a hacker. Tell everyone on your friends list because if somebody on your list adds one of them, they'll be on your list too. They will figure out your personal computer's IP and address, so copy & paste this message where ever you  can.  He is going around sending friend requests to random discord users, and those who accept his requests will have their accounts  and their IP Addresses revealed to him. Spread the word and send this to as many discord servers as you can. If you see this user, DO NOT accept his friend request and immediately report it (copied this from another server)”
Be safe and if already seen at other servers then good

creations-chat 2021-08-15 19:10:25 :)
Yes, no tutorials, they stooopid, you have to learn the hard way or not at all. XD Atleast not in a game like this, if you use tutorials your just stealing somebody’s building style

the-dump 2022-01-02 23:04:36 What
the-dump 2022-02-25 04:25:00 Minions from despicable me are 2.5 feet tall, stack four and you have the height of gru, who is 10 feet tall. Since the great pyramid of giza's steps are each 5 feet tall, and he could jump 4 at once, giving him a great height of a 20 foot jump. He also had the strength to shatter a sharks spine and paralyze it, an average sharks MPa is 564, which means if you were to put MPa into Pascals, you get a millions times stronger. So say he has the strength of 600 mps, enough to break a sharks spine in a single hit, grab 600 and multiply it by a million and you get 600 million, or, 600,000,000. And then convert Pascals into Pound-force per square inch, and Gru has the strength of 87022 Pound force per square inch, this guy is scary, but that's not all, he could dodge a heat-seeking ballistic missile traveling at a speed of 15,000 mph, and he was so fast he made it appear in slow motion. So assuming he was going a speed of 20,000 mph, he is 3 times faster then Mach 10, he is really fast. In the movie, gru shrinks the moon and takes it with him. but with the laws of "Matter cannot be created nor destroyed", he couldn't shrink the mass, so he could lift 73,476,730,900,000,000,000,000 Kilograms. 
Gru is one of the strongest beings alive.
