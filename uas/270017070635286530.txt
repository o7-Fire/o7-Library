help 2020-12-20 20:11:30 the motors are facing front
help 2020-12-20 20:11:48 up
help 2020-12-20 20:13:29 aight so I removed the guns

help 2020-12-21 00:33:09 Commands?
help 2020-12-21 00:34:38 So you can do WASD in it but it doesn't follow your mouse like in a Main
help 2020-12-21 00:38:53 No skill, You can't even fight back, annoying
help 2020-12-21 00:40:06 Oh epic
help 2020-12-21 00:58:36 how do I turn a boat? like what parts do I need.
help 2020-12-21 01:13:39 rudders?
help 2020-12-21 01:13:44 I didnt't know they were in this game
help 2020-12-21 01:19:22 aight
help 2020-12-21 01:19:35 like, control surfaces or wing panels.
help 2020-12-21 01:21:07 oh, aight.
help 2020-12-21 15:54:03 Do boats float automatically or is there some use to put Ballast/Helium blocks on them.
help 2020-12-21 15:55:19 Alright.
help 2020-12-21 16:32:58 What block would go here?
help 2020-12-21 16:33:10 inbetween the Green and the Grey
help 2020-12-21 16:33:45 Thanks.
help 2020-12-21 16:57:38 How do I make my boat turn faster?
help 2020-12-21 16:57:59 I added alot more control surfaces 1x1 on the bottom, where you can't see them in the water, and it turns even slower now
help 2020-12-21 17:03:26 smart man
help 2020-12-21 17:18:18 So can should use Helium blocks to make it float better?
creations-chat 2020-12-21 17:21:05 What should I change on this Dinghy Gunboat?
creations-chat 2020-12-21 17:24:16 noone?
creations-chat 2020-12-21 17:26:25 I don't really know what to paint it, grey and blue is a weird combo that I can't get right.

Also, might add 2 torpedoes.
creations-chat 2020-12-21 17:29:47 yeah well the sides are cylinders so I can't really do that
creations-chat 2020-12-21 17:36:48 So we thinking darker on the paint scale?
creations-chat 2020-12-22 02:10:44 <a:iseeu:775283900331196426>
help 2020-12-22 02:31:53 like, guns controlled by motor 2's or aiming your plane
help 2020-12-22 05:18:14 I too, need a build suggestion. (Anything)
help 2020-12-22 05:19:04 yeah, anything
help 2020-12-22 05:19:44 Alright, Heads for MiG-25, Tails for F-35
help 2020-12-22 05:19:59 I got tails
help 2020-12-22 05:20:10 F-35 it is
help 2020-12-22 05:20:27 VTOL should be easy, plane, not so much
help 2020-12-22 05:23:07 Might make it have Trigger's paintjob from Ace Combat 7 also
help 2020-12-22 05:45:29 What would be better on a Plane (for Air to Air AND Air to Ground)

Rockets, Guns or Fireworks
help 2020-12-22 05:48:21 I kinda wanna try out Fireworks on my P40 (my fastest plane at 450 speed) and see
help 2020-12-22 05:51:01 Wait is the Designer rank for every build?
help 2020-12-22 05:51:15 I have some 40 upvote ones in <#384025409945337856>
help 2020-12-22 05:59:33 Pistons? Idk.
help 2020-12-22 05:59:57 Like a Motor turns the landing gear and then you can push it up 1 block.
help 2020-12-22 06:00:16 Not a expert in this stuff, started playing like a week ago
help 2020-12-22 06:07:20 My idea could work
help 2020-12-22 06:07:40 But half the landing gear would be poking out
help 2020-12-22 06:08:55 half of both
help 2020-12-22 06:09:00 but now looking at it
help 2020-12-22 06:09:03 yeah idk
help 2020-12-22 06:09:15 I was thinking a half piston
help 2020-12-22 06:09:37 pulls it up into the plane or pushes it out
help 2020-12-22 06:10:47 Yeah im the wrong guy to ask
creations-chat 2020-12-22 06:11:31 and in first person

with GUI off
help 2020-12-22 06:13:49 unless it is specifically for shredder killing, I lost respect for you

(I don't know)
help 2020-12-22 06:14:47 Are they on the right way?
help 2020-12-22 06:16:01 Try removing the wheels and putting them on the other way, otherwise It might just be a map glitch or your speed
help 2020-12-22 06:21:44 Well imma sleep
help 2020-12-22 15:35:29 
help 2020-12-22 15:35:30 Should I make this?
help 2020-12-22 15:36:47 I would need the VTOL parts to turn and face fowards to propell me foward
help 2020-12-22 21:25:47 How would one make very good aircraft-dropped bombs.
help 2020-12-22 21:28:59 Would I like, make a big opening underneath the aircraft and have 1 disconnector have 6 explosive balls?
help 2020-12-22 21:30:11 but what about for agile fighters?
help 2020-12-22 21:30:40 My warhawk has some space underneath it
help 2020-12-22 21:34:17 What about explosive squares?
help 2020-12-23 01:22:48 I thought it only had 1 motor 2?
help 2020-12-23 01:27:09 I tried a conveyor engine and its not workin
help 2020-12-23 01:30:38 *can you even do it in a 1 width space*
help 2020-12-23 01:40:28 I'm starting to think Conveyor Engines dont work in 1 width planes
help 2020-12-23 01:40:41 you need 3 free blocks of width and not one
help 2020-12-23 01:40:45 literally all my planes are 1 width
help 2020-12-23 01:47:07 why are Conveyor Engines so complicated oh my god
help 2020-12-23 01:48:25 nothing is working for me
help 2020-12-23 01:48:35 it either caps out at 90 speed or doesn't move at all
help 2020-12-23 01:53:17 so yeah, ur capping
help 2020-12-23 02:17:04 so it can be in a 1 width open space?
help 2020-12-23 02:18:23 Like in here?
help 2020-12-23 02:20:21 i only got into this game a week ago, big words for ape brain
help 2020-12-23 02:22:43 nah nah I know the blocks I just don't know the directions you are telling me
help 2020-12-23 02:30:06 you have to remember, im doing this in a 1 width space
help 2020-12-23 02:46:06 which way is the motor and conveyor facing?
help 2020-12-23 02:47:58 alright ill try it
help 2020-12-23 02:48:03 ill let you know if it doesn't work
help 2020-12-23 02:49:37 so the motor is the one thats closest to the front, right
help 2020-12-23 02:49:42 and the conveyor is the one closest to the back
help 2020-12-23 02:52:30 any controls?
help 2020-12-23 02:53:52 W for foward S for backwards?
help 2020-12-23 02:54:32 so like, R and F?
help 2020-12-23 02:55:36 yeah its still not working
help 2020-12-23 02:56:40 
help 2020-12-23 02:56:53 the blocks below it are half
help 2020-12-23 03:00:01 half wedge up, still doesnt work
help 2020-12-23 03:00:22 why does everyone say these are "Easy and simple"
help 2020-12-23 03:01:41 I think I fixed it?
help 2020-12-23 03:01:58 I pressed left control (the conveyor go foward button) and went 300 speed backwards
help 2020-12-23 03:02:45 <@!683847069890510887> idk give me a minute
help 2020-12-23 03:02:59 cuz now my conveyor is falling
help 2020-12-23 03:03:42 yeah so
help 2020-12-23 03:03:43 it works
help 2020-12-23 03:03:44 but
help 2020-12-23 03:03:51 the conveyor is falling out of place
help 2020-12-23 03:11:39 what situation would the Conveyor Engine be useful in?
help 2020-12-23 03:15:51 because I'm starting to think
help 2020-12-23 03:16:08 is it worth it, I'm practically trading in 150 of my regular speed for a 300 burst speed
help 2020-12-23 03:17:14 and it also glitches out my entire plane (as in like, making it turn when Im going straight, losing half its speed randomly, flipping upside down for no reason) when I'm not even using it
help 2020-12-23 03:19:16 idk what would make my plane twitch by just adding in a piston and a conveyor
help 2020-12-23 03:20:02 so I tried zooming in mid flight to see what the conveyor and piston were doing
help 2020-12-23 03:20:26 turns out its the Conveyor thats glitching
help 2020-12-23 03:20:31 its facing upwards and towards the front
help 2020-12-23 03:28:52 well uh
help 2020-12-23 03:28:55 now what should I build
help 2020-12-23 03:32:22 <@!683847069890510887> <@!486276884611465256> any ideas? (something my skill level, not some 8k block ship behemoth)
help 2020-12-23 03:35:36 uhh something thats not a ship
help 2020-12-23 03:39:04 cuz I am really bad with ships
help 2020-12-23 03:42:26 might make a RC-XD
help 2020-12-23 04:09:06 
help 2020-12-23 04:09:11 Why is it not turning?
help 2020-12-23 04:11:38 
help 2020-12-23 04:11:39 It just does this.
help 2020-12-23 04:12:10 Speed is 2, steering is on, collision is on
help 2020-12-23 04:15:45 oh
help 2020-12-23 04:17:35 now its not turning
help 2020-12-23 04:23:37 so uh
help 2020-12-23 04:23:40 what should I make next
help 2020-12-23 04:23:42 (no ships)
help 2020-12-23 04:30:19 why is my plane glitching out
help 2020-12-23 04:30:29 twitch
help 2020-12-23 04:30:29 the conveyor in my conveyor engine is glitching out and causing my plane to like
help 2020-12-23 04:31:54 
help 2020-12-23 04:32:00 thats enough wing panels
help 2020-12-23 04:37:00 nah Idk how to do that
help 2020-12-23 04:37:23 The conveyor is like moving around very slightly
help 2020-12-23 04:37:33 But its impossible to move around
help 2020-12-23 04:37:53 Because its touching like, 5 different surfaces
help 2020-12-23 04:38:38 Ill try to fix that tomorrow then
help 2020-12-23 04:38:49 so, what am I building next
help 2020-12-23 04:39:00 F14 is heads
help 2020-12-23 04:39:09 whatever you say next is tails
help 2020-12-23 04:54:03 F14 it is
help 2020-12-23 04:57:04 
help 2020-12-23 04:57:14 Anyone know how I would bring the wings out?
help 2020-12-23 05:02:28 Where?

help 2020-12-23 05:08:49 It really isnt
help 2020-12-23 05:09:06 This is my first time building a folding wing plane
help 2020-12-23 05:12:17 Or well, more importantly, HOW am I gonna make it turn
bot-central 2020-12-23 05:39:40 -ping
help 2020-12-23 05:55:57 I mean, *where*
help 2020-12-23 06:02:55 <a:HYPERPOGCHAMPSPEEDALOTWTF:635631589107302402>
help 2020-12-23 06:03:42 how would I put it on? It's not like theres a wedge version
help 2020-12-23 06:05:07 idk how to do motor lock sooo
help 2020-12-23 06:13:11 but
help 2020-12-23 06:13:18 what IS motor lock
help 2020-12-23 06:14:45 How would that help?

help 2020-12-23 06:17:47 but how would motor lock help my wings tho
help 2020-12-23 06:18:30 why would I want that
help 2020-12-23 06:18:43 If all I want is to retract my planes wings
help 2020-12-23 06:19:21 how does the motor even go down
help 2020-12-23 06:19:26 so many questions
help 2020-12-23 06:20:03 so I just watched a tutorial
help 2020-12-23 06:20:07 told me nothing
help 2020-12-23 06:20:36 how to learn motor lock
help 2020-12-23 06:20:52 told me how to make bombs n aa and stuff
help 2020-12-23 06:22:21 so im watching the Motor's immediantly be teleported to the ground
help 2020-12-23 06:22:45 does it get stuck in the first object it touches?
help 2020-12-23 06:23:25 me neither
help 2020-12-23 06:25:21 in the photo of the jet you showed me, the motor lock grabs onto anything it touches and also makes it go into the things below it?
help 2020-12-23 06:27:12 this hurts my head
help 2020-12-23 06:28:19 it is 1:30 at night
help 2020-12-23 06:33:43 "Minor"
help 2020-12-23 06:33:52 bro look at ur plane
help 2020-12-23 06:35:22 well imma sleep soon but I need to know how to do motorlock / pull back my wings
help 2020-12-23 06:35:25 
help 2020-12-23 06:35:33 tryna make this tomorrow
help 2020-12-23 17:33:34 <@!551950808632000512> <@!555965248184778753> so Imma start the work on the F14, ill do the body and cockpit, then the tail and then I'll do the wings for last
help 2020-12-23 17:33:57 also, is Hover-Thrusts better then just putting super-engines in the back?
help 2020-12-23 17:35:21 aight good to know
help 2020-12-23 17:50:50 how would I make these air exausts?
help 2020-12-23 17:55:58 okay i just woke up from a 3 hour to 9 hour nap
help 2020-12-23 17:56:04 dont blame me for saying air exausts
help 2020-12-23 18:03:30 
help 2020-12-23 18:03:43 Now im wondering how to get stuff in the inlets
help 2020-12-23 18:03:57 thanks

help 2020-12-23 18:07:40 
help 2020-12-23 18:07:48 alright so it might be a little bit ugly
help 2020-12-23 18:08:06 but the bottom will get the same colour as the plane, so a darkish gray, the top will be apart of the wing
help 2020-12-23 18:12:57 yeah I don't think these wings are gonna work with these air intakes
help 2020-12-23 18:13:47 F-14
help 2020-12-23 18:13:47 This is only the front wings
help 2020-12-23 18:13:58

help 2020-12-23 18:14:38 
help 2020-12-23 18:14:47 Haven't worked on the cockpit yet
help 2020-12-23 18:17:09 Idk how to do motor lock, but it seems like I would make the sides a 1X2 Delta Wing?
help 2020-12-23 18:20:56 but where would I put the motor

creations-chat 2020-12-24 15:20:04 Oh yeah, ever seen a F-22 have a VTOL? Yeah im making that also.

And ill consider a hover-drive engine if I feel like my plane isn't flying that well,
creations-chat 2020-12-24 15:22:24 welp, wifi died and I hope it saved my stuff.

edit: it did.

help 2020-12-24 17:22:29 aight nevermind then
creations-chat 2020-12-24 17:28:03 This plane can barely get off the ground or turn, any suggestions on how to make it lighter?
creations-chat 2020-12-24 17:30:03 it COULD be the entire VTOL system that I added in for fun, I currently am using 87 super engines sooooo...

<@!712670999899799552> already tried that

Bro, where?
creations-chat 2020-12-24 17:33:29 okay I added more helium blocks and now my plane is lifting up off the ground, maybe its the control of the plane.

any uh...any suggestions?
creations-chat 2020-12-24 17:35:39 any suggestions that aren't motor lock

and I have 87 super engines I don't think adding more speed is gonna help

idk how to make custom control surfaces

what are motor rudders

is that for turning or for going up, because I can't do neither
creations-chat 2020-12-24 17:37:51 it has enough control surfaces..right?
creations-chat 2020-12-24 17:40:34 oops I should've read your message first
creations-chat 2020-12-24 17:43:00 so I tested it out, still wont turn well. It has the angle and everything but it just continues in a relatively straight path

help 2020-12-24 20:26:18 <:hollow:718255544120508478>
help 2020-12-24 20:26:35 so if I cut my speed, itll go up and down faster?
