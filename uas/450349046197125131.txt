creations-chat 2019-11-25 18:49:30 idk
creations-chat 2019-11-25 18:49:39 less can be larger

creations-chat 2021-11-24 00:52:25 it was based off of the video but i made mine out of disconnectors his rig was way smaller and had a larger character

events-chat 2022-05-08 20:09:18 <@466793357318815744> is there a possibility of "moist pony" being added to the wheel it appeared in season 3
events-chat 2022-05-08 20:12:50 i just want to see that thing fight
events-chat 2022-05-08 20:13:23 oh wait it is on the wheel
events-chat 2022-05-08 20:32:47 damn but moist pony is like really op
events-chat 2022-05-08 20:33:51 if nobody wants it can i just take it
events-chat 2022-05-08 20:41:15 cool
events-chat 2022-05-08 20:54:21 if they don't want to build it will they get a third reroll?
events-chat 2022-05-09 15:52:09 To be accurate it would have to be comically small but it has 3 spinners
events-chat 2022-05-09 15:52:27 Which is why I want it
events-chat 2022-05-10 05:41:46 if you don't get anything back from moist pony i'll take rusty

events-chat 2022-05-15 16:43:26 is there a server link?
events-chat 2022-05-15 16:53:13 yeah i touched him barely and it flung me across the map
events-chat 2022-05-15 17:22:20 bigger battlebots in the show should have larger size in the event
events-chat 2022-05-15 17:22:37 because if huge was comically small he can't do anything
events-chat 2022-05-15 17:25:36 yeah depends on what bot
events-chat 2022-05-15 17:26:25 like huge relies on bots being able to fit between his wheels to do dmg, there was a bot that added an extension to make themselves bigger in the actual show and won because it had control over the fight
events-chat 2022-05-15 17:41:42 i mean he said to make them as similar to the real bots as possible
events-chat 2022-05-15 17:42:43 i mean theres no other way to get back in the arena for some of the lore accurate bots
events-chat 2022-05-15 17:43:37 ok thats pretty bs
events-chat 2022-05-15 17:44:37 i mean their matchups werent the best
events-chat 2022-05-15 17:45:13 they put a spinner bot against another spinner bot (both have 360 range) and a flipper bot against another flipper bot (both do like no dmg)
events-chat 2022-05-15 17:46:11 yeah thats the bs part
events-chat 2022-05-15 17:51:34 i mean cheating should be disqualified right?
events-chat 2022-05-15 17:52:35 i mean he did organize the event
events-chat 2022-05-15 17:52:51 and still lost
events-chat 2022-05-15 17:53:50 yeah probably
events-chat 2022-05-15 17:54:09 most people cheated im pretty sure unintentionally or intentionally
events-chat 2022-05-15 17:56:48 i mean it was approved by the host and chomp did get a few liberties for being a walker
events-chat 2022-05-15 17:57:07 even though it ended up being on wheels
events-chat 2022-05-15 17:59:14 if it was a walker i'd understand the bonuses
events-chat 2022-05-15 18:00:07 that one is a weird one
events-chat 2022-05-15 18:00:32 like my version's walking mechanism probably would get one shot
events-chat 2022-05-15 18:02:35 its a tough call to say what should get a bonus and what shouldnt
