The Tale of _richerd (447194181816025098)
help 2021-03-21 14:19:53 How do you make a plane that actually flies?
help 2021-03-21 14:20:25 All my conventional designs have failed to take off.
help 2021-03-21 14:31:21 Not enough lift. To be exact, not enough pitch control.
help 2021-03-21 14:32:23 Flaps?
help 2021-03-21 14:32:33 How do you build flaps?
help 2021-03-21 14:32:45 Do flaps even exist in Plane Crazy?
help 2021-03-21 14:32:48 Oh.
help 2021-03-21 14:32:51 Motors.
help 2021-03-21 14:33:23 Thanks.
help 2021-03-21 14:34:07 The funny thing is, all my twin-boom aircraft designs work perfectly while my conventional designs suck.
help 2021-03-21 14:34:32 Thanks.
the-dump 2021-03-22 12:21:16 So uh.
the-dump 2021-03-22 12:25:07 And now, realising the idiot that I am and the mistake I have committed, shall now delete my past messages to prevent further embarrassment.
the-dump 2021-03-22 12:26:19 But really, why the hell can't I surf the internet for one hour without seeing a media article about "human rights abuses in China".
the-dump 2021-03-22 12:26:28 Like, I live in China.
the-dump 2021-03-22 12:26:42 I don't see human rights abuses. And I'm certainly not being abused.
the-dump 2021-03-22 12:27:05 I just needed to let off some steam.
the-dump 2021-03-22 12:27:31 A guy in PF was spamming chat with anti-China stuff obviously translated via Google Translate.
the-dump 2021-03-22 12:28:04 Turned out he was just another kid who has no idea what it's like to be in China.
the-dump 2021-03-22 12:28:12 Data breach?
the-dump 2021-03-22 12:29:46 When?
the-dump 2021-03-22 12:30:01 I'm not seeing that on the Times.
the-dump 2021-03-22 12:30:11 Last I checked that was a Russian thing.
the-dump 2021-03-22 12:30:30 Gimme a link or something.
the-dump 2021-03-22 12:34:08 Mmm.
the-dump 2021-03-22 12:34:30 Might be a opening action to the Alaska talks.
the-dump 2021-03-22 12:34:35 Eh.
the-dump 2021-03-22 12:34:50 Was it necessary? Maybe not.
the-dump 2021-03-22 12:35:56 Yea.
the-dump 2021-03-22 12:36:16 A lot of common misconceptions.
the-dump 2021-03-22 12:36:22 And yes, that's also a factor.
the-dump 2021-03-22 12:37:07 We don't really strive towards absolute freedom. We want happy, satisfactory lives.
the-dump 2021-03-22 12:37:53 We just want a decent house, a decent job, decent grades, decent pay.
the-dump 2021-03-22 12:38:19 Partly because just a few decades ago, we were still dirt poor.
the-dump 2021-03-22 12:38:58 The pay's higher than that.
the-dump 2021-03-22 12:39:08 And it all comes down to different standards.
the-dump 2021-03-22 12:39:23 Mmm, yea.
the-dump 2021-03-22 12:39:55 You can still get 10k RMB each month in higher paying factory jobs.
the-dump 2021-03-22 12:40:22 Actually no.
the-dump 2021-03-22 12:40:40 We have other apps for inside China.
the-dump 2021-03-22 12:40:57 Like Baidu. And Weibo.
the-dump 2021-03-22 12:41:14 Weibo's basically Discord and Facebook mashed together.
the-dump 2021-03-22 12:41:32 We don't really care about that.
the-dump 2021-03-22 12:41:42 Yea...
the-dump 2021-03-22 12:41:52 We know.
the-dump 2021-03-22 12:41:57 We know about Tiananmen.
the-dump 2021-03-22 12:42:05 We know about the Uyghurs.
the-dump 2021-03-22 12:42:14 We know about Xinjiang and Mongolia.
the-dump 2021-03-22 12:42:33 Not really.
the-dump 2021-03-22 12:42:41 We know. But we don't care much.
the-dump 2021-03-22 12:43:09 Look, the point here is, we don't care if we're being tracked.
the-dump 2021-03-22 12:43:26 We're not feeling oppressed.
the-dump 2021-03-22 12:43:52 The point here is, are we leading decent lives? Are our lives matching our expectations? Are we happy?
the-dump 2021-03-22 12:43:54 Yes.
the-dump 2021-03-22 12:43:57 Yes we are.
the-dump 2021-03-22 12:44:00 We're happy.
the-dump 2021-03-22 12:44:04 And that's all that matters.
the-dump 2021-03-22 12:44:37 If I was brainwashed I wouldn't know about Tiananmen or Xinjiang, now would I?
the-dump 2021-03-22 12:44:54 And I know that we've done even worse.
the-dump 2021-03-22 12:45:02 But are we happy now?
the-dump 2021-03-22 12:45:04 Yes.
the-dump 2021-03-22 12:45:27 China is where we call home.
the-dump 2021-03-22 12:45:59 Reeducation. Basically brainwash prisons for radicals.
the-dump 2021-03-22 12:46:04 Yes.
the-dump 2021-03-22 12:46:29 And no, VPNs are not illegal.
the-dump 2021-03-22 12:46:36 Actually I am.
the-dump 2021-03-22 12:46:44 I'm allowed to talk about the stuff.
the-dump 2021-03-22 12:46:56 It's only illegal if you actively try to sell VPNs.
the-dump 2021-03-22 12:47:05 You can use it.
the-dump 2021-03-22 12:47:41 Everyone can talk about the stuff! How hard is it to understand!?
the-dump 2021-03-22 12:48:01 I'm just another middle-class person in a Chinese city!
the-dump 2021-03-22 12:48:28 Because why would you mention Tiananmen while you're at work or buying breakfast.
the-dump 2021-03-22 12:48:39 Ahem. Misconception there.
the-dump 2021-03-22 12:49:44 No, but I would probably get beat up by my neighbour's grandpa.
the-dump 2021-03-22 12:50:34 What.
the-dump 2021-03-22 12:50:41 What.
the-dump 2021-03-22 12:50:47 A flat?
the-dump 2021-03-22 12:51:15 I lived there once, yes.
the-dump 2021-03-22 12:56:23 I once fell for a similar meme but instead of being a gay diagnosis it was a rickroll.
the-dump 2021-03-22 12:57:04 I don't know how I didn't see that in advance.
the-dump 2021-03-22 12:58:03 Is that Earth?
the-dump 2021-03-22 12:58:41 Ah yes. Soul Knight.
the-dump 2021-03-22 12:59:38 Actually what makes Chrome load so slowly?
the-dump 2021-03-22 13:00:11 It runs super buttery after you boot it up so is that some prep sequence?
the-dump 2021-03-22 13:01:06 Oh.
the-dump 2021-03-22 13:01:15 Bots kinda suck.
the-dump 2021-03-22 13:01:29 I have.
the-dump 2021-03-22 13:01:33 It also sucked.
the-dump 2021-03-22 13:02:03 I made it for a school project.
the-dump 2021-03-22 13:02:12 Using templates.
the-dump 2021-03-22 13:02:20 Template sprites.
the-dump 2021-03-22 17:37:53 No.
the-dump 2021-03-22 17:38:06 No.
the-dump 2021-03-22 17:38:10 Please don't.
the-dump 2021-03-22 17:39:00 Among Us itself is not a bad game.
the-dump 2021-03-22 17:39:13 The community's reaction to it, however...
the-dump 2021-03-22 17:39:18 NO, NOT NOTCH!
the-dump 2021-03-22 17:42:36 Stop...the sus...
the-dump 2021-03-22 17:42:42 I can't take it anymore...
the-dump 2021-03-22 17:43:21 This is cancer.
the-dump 2021-03-22 17:43:31 Oh come on!
the-dump 2021-03-22 17:44:10 Well we have to acknowledge that our phones are built upon billions upon trillions of 1s and 0s.
the-dump 2021-03-22 17:44:33 OOoOoOoO!111!!
the-dump 2021-03-22 17:46:29 Susbishous
the-dump 2021-03-22 17:46:36 Verrry susbishous.
the-dump 2021-03-22 17:47:02 Red crewmate.
the-dump 2021-03-22 17:49:59 I don't think that'll do any good. All that .50 BMG will only destroy the Kriss Vector's delicate recoil system.
the-dump 2021-03-22 17:50:23 You have to remember that the Kriss has a pulley in its recoil system.
the-dump 2021-03-22 17:50:48 A pulley.
the-dump 2021-03-22 17:50:55 A pulley with a rubber belt.
the-dump 2021-03-22 17:51:08 You can't expect that to handle .50.
the-dump 2021-03-22 17:52:37 Why do you have a grenade launcher attached under a grenade launcher attached under a grenade launcher that's attached to a bayonet.
the-dump 2021-03-22 17:53:30 Why'd you attach it on a bayonet?
the-dump 2021-03-22 17:53:39 More ordnance.
the-dump 2021-03-22 17:53:52 Wait, the 27?
the-dump 2021-03-22 17:53:58 You mean the Frogfoot?
the-dump 2021-03-22 17:54:05 Or the Flanker?
the-dump 2021-03-22 17:54:09 Oh the Flanker.
the-dump 2021-03-22 17:54:20 You can't compare the Flanker to the Warthog.
the-dump 2021-03-22 17:54:41 One is for air superiority and the other is for ground pounding.
the-dump 2021-03-22 17:54:57 The rounds they carry are different.
the-dump 2021-03-22 17:55:32 I'd say that the Flanker carries HEFI-T while the Warthog carries AP/HVAP/DU.
the-dump 2021-03-22 17:55:44 Well not really.
the-dump 2021-03-22 17:55:46 More guns.
the-dump 2021-03-22 17:55:51 And more ordnance.
the-dump 2021-03-22 17:56:05 What will I get brrt'd for saying that?
the-dump 2021-03-22 17:56:14 Yes.
the-dump 2021-03-22 17:56:18 That is true.
the-dump 2021-03-22 17:56:21 Hydras.
the-dump 2021-03-22 17:56:35 But the A-10 is getting old.
the-dump 2021-03-22 17:56:45 The Frogfoot too.
the-dump 2021-03-22 17:57:13 I'm in favour of the new generation of light attack aircraft like the Super Tucano.
the-dump 2021-03-22 17:57:22 Mass produced props.
the-dump 2021-03-22 17:57:38 Well the F35 is expensive.
the-dump 2021-03-22 17:57:56 The Super Tucano, on the other hand, is not.
the-dump 2021-03-22 17:58:09 It's simple, it can do its job, and it's relatively cheap.
the-dump 2021-03-22 17:58:27 Nah, the Harrier was superior.
the-dump 2021-03-22 17:58:42 You could change throttle vector during flight with the Harrier.
the-dump 2021-03-22 17:58:53 You can't really do that with the Lightning II.
the-dump 2021-03-22 18:00:24 The Brits developed the Harrier because they wanted an aircraft that could take off from very short airfields.
the-dump 2021-03-22 18:02:10 The USMC adopted the Harrier because they needed an attack aircraft that could take off from amphibious landing ships.
the-dump 2021-03-22 18:02:23 So we do still need VTOLs.
the-dump 2021-03-22 18:02:50 Amphibious landing ships are substantially cheaper than aircraft carriers.
the-dump 2021-03-22 18:03:01 I think the US still does.
the-dump 2021-03-22 18:03:10 Certain branches of the USMC.
the-dump 2021-03-22 18:03:21 Yep.
the-dump 2021-03-22 18:03:55 True.
the-dump 2021-03-22 18:04:26 They also get the M27 which is a souped-up HK416 as their standard issue automatic rifle.
the-dump 2021-03-22 18:04:50 While the Army and the Airforce are stuck with M4s.
the-dump 2021-03-22 18:05:04 They have been for a long time.
the-dump 2021-03-22 18:05:21 BIGG SUCC.
the-dump 2021-03-22 18:06:01 But you really have to praise the F-100 for its service.
the-dump 2021-03-22 18:06:11 I'm not saying that it was a MiG killer.
the-dump 2021-03-22 18:06:27 It was the first aircraft the Americans used for Wild Weasel.
the-dump 2021-03-22 18:06:47 I'm gonna clarify that I'm not American.
the-dump 2021-03-22 18:07:01 I'm just saying that, the F-100 was a Wild Weasel aircraft.
the-dump 2021-03-22 18:07:16 Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses.
the-dump 2021-03-22 18:07:59 Basically they intentionally flew above surface-to-air missile sites and tried to shoot first before being shot down.
the-dump 2021-03-22 18:09:02 Well it was the only idea they had for some reason.
the-dump 2021-03-22 18:09:16 And it is a terrible idea.
the-dump 2021-03-22 18:09:56 And somehow the pilots agreed to it.
the-dump 2021-03-22 18:10:25 Well yea.
the-dump 2021-03-22 18:11:24 Excuse the cussword here. Their unofficial motto was "You gotta be shitting me", a quote from a B-52 pilot after learning that they were assigned to the Wild Weasel role.
the-dump 2021-03-22 18:12:22 SEAD. Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses.
the-dump 2021-03-22 18:12:48 A B-52 radar operator, to be exact.
the-dump 2021-03-22 18:13:07 He was transferred to be a Wild Weasel RIO.
the-dump 2021-03-22 18:17:19 The Super Sabre sucked in that role.
the-dump 2021-03-22 18:18:44 Across a span of 45 days, the Wild Weasel squadron had lost all but one aircraft, four pilots were killed, two were captured, and two quit.
the-dump 2021-03-22 18:23:47 Idk.
the-dump 2021-03-22 18:24:34 Special Anti-SAM teams, maybe?
the-dump 2021-03-22 18:24:50 Yep.
the-dump 2021-03-22 18:25:18 And somehow the USAF is still doing Wild Weasel, albeit with different aircraft.
the-dump 2021-03-22 18:25:30 Now it's called SEAD. Same concept.
the-dump 2021-03-22 18:34:00 NO.
the-dump 2021-03-22 18:34:04 NOT THE AMOGUS.
the-dump 2021-03-22 18:34:45 Can you stop
the-dump 2021-03-22 18:34:53 And yes, SEAD works nowadays.
the-dump 2021-03-22 18:35:05 I'm just stating that it was a bad concept at the start.
the-dump 2021-03-22 18:38:39 You should always use grammar.
the-dump 2021-03-22 18:39:18 To embrace one's lack of grammar is to openly admit that one is a barbarian.
the-dump 2021-03-22 18:39:50 No, in fact I am not.
the-dump 2021-03-22 18:41:14 Well I'm not grammar police.
the-dump 2021-03-22 18:41:53 It's easier to read.
the-dump 2021-03-22 18:42:41 And it's certainly a must in closed community roleplay.
the-dump 2021-03-22 18:42:48 I'm not grammar police.
the-dump 2021-03-22 18:42:52 I just use it myself.
the-dump 2021-03-22 18:44:41 Hmm.
the-dump 2021-03-22 18:44:43 Oh well.
the-dump 2021-03-22 18:45:26 Who?
the-dump 2021-03-22 18:47:13 I say that since the word's intention was not to incite discussion, I find it not a violation of Rule Nr. 2.
the-dump 2021-03-22 18:48:42 Her Majesty's loyal opposition.
the-dump 2021-03-22 18:48:55 We would never think of treason!
the-dump 2021-03-22 18:49:37 Discord is a weird place.
the-dump 2021-03-22 18:49:46 Actually Sprite is the best.
the-dump 2021-03-22 18:50:04 No. It's just that the roleplay servers that I frequent are much less chaotic.
the-dump 2021-03-22 18:50:29 Look, I'm not a ODer.
the-dump 2021-03-22 18:50:32 Just to clarify.
the-dump 2021-03-22 18:50:41 Yep.
the-dump 2021-03-22 18:50:55 Oh come on!
the-dump 2021-03-22 18:52:31 You will drown in 0:05.
the-dump 2021-03-22 18:52:39 Fellow WT player?
the-dump 2021-03-22 18:53:12 Gaijoob.
the-dump 2021-03-22 18:53:45 The Adventure of Harry Piotr and Gaijoob's Server Hampsters.
the-dump 2021-03-22 18:54:08 Wow.
the-dump 2021-03-22 18:54:24 Top tier lineup.
the-dump 2021-03-22 18:54:32 With a squadron vehicle.
the-dump 2021-03-22 18:56:13 Well if you conquer all the countries or own a high-level deterrent then maybe you can achieve world peace.
the-dump 2021-03-22 18:56:36 If you sell that deterrent you will have effectively put a price on world peace.
the-dump 2021-03-22 18:56:54 Maybe.
the-dump 2021-03-22 18:56:57 Maybe.
the-dump 2021-03-22 18:57:13 Well, yes.
the-dump 2021-03-22 18:57:24 The latter is more realistic.
the-dump 2021-03-22 18:57:31 Maybe a planet killer?
the-dump 2021-03-22 18:57:58 When Bf-109 spawn strafing.
the-dump 2021-03-22 18:59:12 Step 1: Buy E.B.R. 1954. Step 2: Join a match. Step 3: Become the most hated person in the server.
the-dump 2021-03-22 18:59:33 Well true.
the-dump 2021-03-22 19:00:48 We the Chinese have an old saying that goes, "What is united for a long time must be divided, what is divided for a long time must become united."
the-dump 2021-03-22 19:01:18 It applies to everything.
the-dump 2021-03-22 19:01:33 One day the countries of the world will no longer be the ones we see today.
the-dump 2021-03-22 19:02:20 China's been breaking and reuniting constantly for the past three centuries.
the-dump 2021-03-22 19:02:51 The China now is probably gonna be another Tang Dynasty.
the-dump 2021-03-22 19:03:09 I'm not gonna live long enough to see it break.
the-dump 2021-03-22 19:03:24 And I guess that's a good thing.
the-dump 2021-03-22 19:04:15 The world is what it is, there's nothing pessimistic about it.
the-dump 2021-03-22 19:04:41 We'll need a common enemy to achieve world peace.
the-dump 2021-03-22 19:04:46 Like aliens.
the-dump 2021-03-22 19:04:54 Humans have too many races.
the-dump 2021-03-22 19:04:59 Too many languages.
the-dump 2021-03-22 19:05:17 Our altruist minds will only care about people similar to us.
the-dump 2021-03-22 19:05:56 What, would you fight for a South African country in a land war?
the-dump 2021-03-22 19:06:51 We haven't. There have always been tensions.
the-dump 2021-03-22 19:07:38 Really, the only way to achieve world peace is if all countries adopted a seclusion policy.
the-dump 2021-03-22 19:08:17 That would inevitably destroy the economy and humans would probably have trouble evolving.
the-dump 2021-03-22 19:08:37 So, just let the world stay as what it is now.
the-dump 2021-03-22 19:08:45 It's working.
