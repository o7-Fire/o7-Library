plane-crazy 2020-07-30 21:32:02 Uh some reason the game has loaded a older save version of my starship wip even though I saved it
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 18:30:18 How can I stop ropes from glitching?
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 11:05:50 Can you help me

plane-crazy 2020-07-19 10:43:56 Who has built a zeppelin or blimp and can help me balance my zeppelin
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 04:56:57 Help?
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 04:56:53 My zeppelin is still rolling once in air
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 04:43:39 How fast should my zeppelin go?

plane-crazy 2020-07-13 02:50:30 I like crashing into the drone island and letting my plane get blended into bits then rain from above.
plane-crazy 2020-07-11 11:16:56 I got out, but a part of the plane hit me and the chute held
plane-crazy 2020-07-11 11:16:04 The plane got chopped up and then fell into the lava
