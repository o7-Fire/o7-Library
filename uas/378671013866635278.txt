plane-crazy 2019-08-18 21:54:21 steggy you need to calm down and post memes exclusevely in <#495286269459300364>
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 21:53:18 is it bad im thinking of making this runway fly
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 21:52:17 is 2,640 blocks
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 21:52:11 so the runway by itself with all the blocks filled in
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 21:51:16 ok so one layer on the fold is 132 blocks
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 21:49:39 lol
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 21:49:06 for one layer
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 21:49:04 the area is 3 1x7 for the width and 6 1x7 for the length
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 21:48:30 so how much do you guys think the part count will be once i fill in the runway?
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 21:48:13 wut
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 21:48:04 looks cool
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 21:47:01 to make it longer
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 21:46:58 in order
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 21:46:56 i have to make it taller
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 21:46:51 steggy
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 21:46:48 that rotates 180 degrees to line up with the rest of it
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 21:46:35 i could make it have a 2nd part that folds
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 21:46:22 well
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 21:46:19 ive reached the build height limit
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 21:46:13 nope
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 21:45:06 who
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 21:41:34 that pretty much sums it up
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 21:40:58 this is the whole runway collapsed down
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 21:40:15 yeah
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 21:40:08 and over 400 beams
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 21:40:00 ive already used 3 1x7 beams to make the width of this
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 21:39:43 i was told that it needed to be longer
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 21:39:34 mobile runway
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 21:39:22 perfection
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 21:38:24 it did need to be longer
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 21:38:19 you guys were right
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 21:26:47 the width is already 3 1x7 beams together
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 21:26:35 should i make it about 7 units wider?
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 21:26:03 alright so this is how much longer i can make the runway due to the height limit for build plots
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 21:24:22 its at these moments when i wish i could scale the width of blocks
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 21:23:47 than my first mobile runway
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 21:23:42 im trying to keep part count farther down
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 21:23:32 well
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 21:23:17 or more
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 21:23:15 cause i could probrably double the size
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 21:23:05 really?
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 21:22:46 hey guys is this too long for a mobile runway?
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 21:18:56 .-.
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 21:17:57 for that image to look normal
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 21:17:49 i need to grab my expensive monitor and violentely shake it
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 21:17:32 what im getting from this is
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 21:17:21 so
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 21:16:42 wait, thats distorted
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 21:12:53 bruh
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 21:12:02 is it bad im trying to make a full sized flying runway
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 21:10:49 that aint good
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 21:10:27 ah
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 21:10:02 anyone know if block scaling has been suggested a lot?
plane-crazy 2019-07-29 00:18:27 ive got to upload through youtube
plane-crazy 2019-07-29 00:18:21 nevermind
plane-crazy 2019-07-29 00:18:03 i think i just crashed my game client
plane-crazy 2019-07-29 00:17:57 whoops
plane-crazy 2019-07-29 00:17:35 bit frustrating that i cant do a direct upload tbh
plane-crazy 2019-07-29 00:16:40 i would upload the video here but discord dosent let the xbox game bar video format upload
plane-crazy 2019-07-29 00:16:14 i cant tell if this is a good or bad thing that i made https://youtu.be/cPqiwRIUnLo
plane-crazy 2019-07-29 00:14:15 where did area 51 come into this conversation
plane-crazy 2019-07-29 00:12:41 am i allowed to post links to youtube videos here?
plane-crazy 2019-07-29 00:10:32 ill call it that then
plane-crazy 2019-07-29 00:10:26 k
plane-crazy 2019-07-29 00:10:11 hey guys what would be a hybrid word to call a scattershot catapult?
plane-crazy 2019-07-29 00:06:12 i wonder if i could utilise the catapult i made to throw bombs or something
plane-crazy 2019-07-29 00:05:22 lets see it
plane-crazy 2019-07-29 00:00:12 is it bad i made a working scattershot catapult that i filled with parachutes?
plane-crazy 2019-06-03 17:04:46 until you try to build an engine on the helicarrier
plane-crazy 2019-06-03 17:04:34 you dont realise how small the plot is
