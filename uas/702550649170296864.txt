creations-chat 2023-03-20 01:25:24 <@883063424614006878>  can you give me some feedback on my jet?
creations-chat 2023-03-20 01:28:18 
creations-chat 2023-03-27 02:38:40 like what abt it
creations-chat 2023-03-27 02:41:21 it's a small body bc it's rlly a 1x1 and short
creations-chat 2023-03-27 02:54:17 actually it's pretty hard bc you need to know decent motorlocking. If anything 2 wide is no skill bc 8 times out of 10 there is very little to no motorlock
