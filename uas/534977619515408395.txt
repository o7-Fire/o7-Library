help 2019-01-29 20:41:54 anyone know why the explosive block is so inconsistent when on impact mode?
help 2019-01-29 21:54:53 Vehicle is not moving, it may be the speed at which it's going. I stacked six magnets to basically create a railgun and the block is launched across the map, as fast as a jet engine on full throttle at launch.
