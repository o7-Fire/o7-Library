creations-chat 2022-01-05 03:00:29 yeah same i'm surprised you didnt immediately get bombed with dislikes, usually those kinds of simple/minimal builds get trash ratings

creations-chat 2022-05-04 07:28:41 This incident was strikingly similar to the concepts presented in the 1949 dystopian fiction novel written by an English author referred to under the pen name George Orwell known as "Nineteen Eighty-Four" or "1984".

creations-chat 2022-05-06 06:30:19 Bruh. I am new to the game as I already said. Why is this community so toxic? Seriously I just wanted some constructive criticism and this is the shit I get. I am packing up right now as we speak and booking the first flight I can find to Dublin. This game sucks.
