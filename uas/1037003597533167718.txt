creations-chat 2023-01-12 23:34:15 my concept Mig-121M4 FishbedQ (with future cockpit design i think so)
help 2023-01-13 03:58:29 can someone give me some idea about how to make the front landing gear look good like that one
help 2023-01-13 03:59:06 mine look pretty simple and...
help 2023-01-13 03:59:42 or this one is good enough
help 2023-01-13 08:53:08 hey guy
help 2023-01-13 08:53:50 anyone know the angle of wing on the mig-21 when it turn?
help 2023-01-13 08:55:11 the maximum angle of that part
help 2023-01-13 08:55:18 when it work
help 2023-01-13 08:55:29 30 degree or lower?
help 2023-01-13 12:18:04 ok got it
help 2023-01-14 05:34:00 if i want to make the vertical tail like that then custom angle is my only choice right guy?
help 2023-01-22 09:19:03 i want my aircraft wings to fold perfectly in that gap but motor lock seems not to be a good idea, what should i do?
help 2023-01-22 09:21:20 well yeah i will try again some time the piston is a little bit buggy
help 2023-01-22 09:22:01 like i set it to lock mode but when i lock sometime it work and sometime it return back to normal and  then bug
help 2023-01-22 09:22:51 the piston should be face down right ?
help 2023-01-22 09:45:33 after 7748 times trying i finally succedded
help 2023-01-24 06:59:41 is it ok if i left this wings like this?
help 2023-01-24 07:01:39 the gap is pretty big
help 2023-01-24 07:02:58 also i wanna make F-22 engine style at the space next to it
help 2023-01-24 07:53:58 look better now
help 2023-01-24 11:38:15 should i use a motor to make the engines able to turn up and down or not
help 2023-01-24 11:39:58 well if i do, there will be some motors exposed and will look a little bit ugly
help 2023-01-24 11:46:22 it will look like this
help 2023-01-24 11:46:32 so still worth it right?
help 2023-01-24 11:46:41 not as bad as i though
help 2023-01-24 12:34:04 anyone know a better way to replace disconnector with something to stop or hold motor lock?
help 2023-01-24 12:34:43 springs seem not to work so well
help 2023-01-24 12:48:32 that is the problem
help 2023-01-24 13:00:34 oh well i finally solve the problem
help 2023-01-24 13:01:33 make it like this and it will not effeect other part of my aircraft
creations-chat 2023-01-24 15:08:08 wdym?
help 2023-01-24 15:10:01 for some reason when flying my aircraft keep pointing the nose up for no reason what should i do to fix it?
creations-chat 2023-01-24 15:11:23 told you that was my first creation because i'm still new to this game, don't expect too much on my skills
help 2023-01-24 15:11:54 ok got it
creations-chat 2023-01-24 15:21:14 it is not a tomcat, the idea come from this videohttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3nea0-91SM, it like a combination of F-15, F-14 and F-22, the main body is from F-15 the wings are F-14 and engines are F-22
help 2023-01-24 15:21:51 it keep flying up like that
creations-chat 2023-01-24 15:23:19 no bruh, i have watched that video a lot of time, the main fighter in that video is not F-14 i swear, look at the verticals tail wings of it it more like from a F-15 not F-14 and the engines like from a F-22. And how does a F-14 have air brake on it's back?
creations-chat 2023-01-24 15:28:04 And also if you watch that video with slower speed you will relize that the air intake design is more like from a F-15, it does not angle a little bit like on the F-14.
help 2023-01-24 15:31:37 well i thing i know the problem, i made the air brake from wings so when i angle it , i make the plane fly up
help 2023-01-24 15:34:22 but put a ballast in the nose slow down the plane a lot and i don't really want to keep the air brake, what should i do?
help 2023-01-24 15:35:10 or maybe i made too much part on the jet from wings and most of it is horizontal so it accidently help the plane have a lot of lift?
creations-chat 2023-01-24 15:38:05 it is not F-14 told you
creations-chat 2023-01-24 15:41:19 see a huge differences
creations-chat 2023-01-24 15:51:25 yeah i know it is a F-14 but mine is not F-14
creations-chat 2023-01-24 15:57:44 look at the canopy, the verticals tail wings and the engines
help 2023-01-24 16:20:20 ty i will try
help 2023-01-25 06:45:12 it is not working
help 2023-01-25 06:47:23 or using hover thruster engine is the problem?
help 2023-01-26 01:45:17 it fly very stable at fast speed nearly 700 but still can not do a full 360 degree turn what should i do to fix this?
help 2023-01-26 01:45:39 remove all control airsurface or what?
creations-chat 2023-01-29 13:35:11 is it a little bit too fat?
help 2023-05-25 10:07:04 ahh guy if i add more wing surface into the aircraft body will it have any effect to the aircraft?
help 2023-05-25 10:07:34 for example using motor lock to add more wing to the aircraft
help 2023-05-26 04:04:24 
help 2023-05-26 04:04:49 how can i fix that when the landing gear pull up?
help 2023-05-26 04:05:40 the gap when the landing gear pull up, i tried with trap door but it will make the landing gear stuck, do i need to use motor lock for it to?
help 2023-05-26 04:06:24 that 4 holes
help 2023-05-26 06:40:22 does this 2 gap acceptable guy?
help 2023-05-26 07:01:34 Does anyone know a good color for german's fighter jet cocpit
creations-chat 2023-05-27 10:41:04 i finally fixed it
creations-chat 2023-05-27 14:40:38 the main body is finally done now i can finally rest and planning making the wings
creations-chat 2023-05-27 14:43:03 and there are about 4 to 5 exposed motors hope it is still ok
creations-chat 2023-05-28 12:02:22 My first test flight with my ME-262 HG III, and the results came pretty good, decent speed, very fast rolling speed (should i slow it down?), decent turning speed (should i make it faster?), and the aircraft has some wobble problem, does anyone have any advice on how can i fix it? And one more thing is about the smoke how can i make it look better.
creations-chat 2023-05-28 12:04:27 Don't mind some crash part because i'm not a good pilot
creations-chat 2023-05-28 15:17:36 Tomorrow i will finish the painting progress and then i can finally rest
creations-chat 2023-05-28 15:19:39 well much smaller then my previous model, my previous one even need motor folding for the main wings
creations-chat 2023-05-28 15:26:48 i found 3 model for the ME-262 HG III but i prefer the third one, the first model cockpit is so hard to make and the second model rear wings look not so special so i choose the third one to make
help 2023-05-29 03:25:43 What color should i use for German plane cockpit guy?
creations-chat 2023-05-29 04:35:37 It is finally done.
creations-chat 2023-05-29 06:25:05 No, it is ME-262 HG III not yf-23 or even f4 phantom
creations-chat 2023-06-12 09:22:18 My mig-27 body and landing gears are finally done ( I mean the landing gears are about 90% complete) and this is how the landing gears work, it looks kinda bad because the mechanism of the rear landing gears of the mig-23 and 27 is so hard to make and I tried my best, also I will make the cover for the nose landing gear later, also the landing gears are weak as hell because I use motor 2 so I have to add camera under the aircraft to make it stand normally.
creations-chat 2023-06-12 09:25:41 Also, I don't know if it looks too big, I tried my best to make it not oversize.
creations-chat 2023-06-12 10:22:08 well not actually if you know how the f-111 rear landing gears mechanism, it is very different to the Mig-23 but as i said the mechanism of the mig-23 and 27 is very hard to make, and the size of the wheels is also a problem ( watch this video: https://youtu.be/2zcqXAurwEA), i tried my best to make it's mechanism as close to the real one as i can and i think the f-111 landing gear is easier to make ( i mean not 100% the same as the real one but we can make it simpler).
bot-central 2023-06-12 10:28:34 !rank
creations-chat 2023-06-12 10:50:23 Ah well, I have no idea how big they are but my mig-27 is actually pretty big
creations-chat 2023-06-12 10:56:06 The Mig-33 is real guy
creations-chat 2023-06-12 12:14:47 I'm sorry but the image may be a concept but I read the information on the wiki and it kinda joint with that image:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikoyan_MiG-33.
creations-chat 2023-06-13 07:03:21 Mig-27 mechanism testing (landing gears, wings sweep,... no test fly yet), and does anyone know the mig-27 only rolls left and right with lower wings tail or it uses both main wings flap to turn and wing tail? Anh Yeah it is kinda big or maybe oversize.
creations-chat 2023-06-13 07:33:35 well yeah i know it is a little bit ugly, i tried my best
creations-chat 2023-06-13 07:35:40 Yeah a lot of morden and cold war plane use that mechanism.
creations-chat 2023-06-13 07:44:35 TY a lot
creations-chat 2023-06-13 09:05:43 If this is the ailerons then where will the spoilers be?
creations-chat 2023-06-13 09:09:19 that is the spoilers used for turn and spoilers used for brake in the air and on the ground.
creations-chat 2023-06-13 10:22:13 You know what i will just delete this thing and make a smaller version of it, for some reason this thing is super super unstable.
creations-chat 2023-06-23 03:30:01 text flight with my mig-27, for some reason, it pulls up and down very strongly and the aircraft is a little bit unstable when flight.
creations-chat 2023-06-23 03:33:58 well, I have only 3 jets in my storage, that's all I have after nearly 1 year play this game.
creations-chat 2023-06-23 05:20:09 i see some video gameplay of the mig-27 in warthunder and that is how it work
bot-central 2023-06-23 07:54:57 !rank
creations-chat 2023-06-25 09:28:03 second test flight after some modification and every statistic turn out pretty good, except for the fps.
creations-chat 2023-06-25 09:34:46 my plane can float without an anchor block
creations-chat 2023-06-25 11:17:57 but what effect will it have on the aircraft if i do that ?
creations-chat 2023-06-25 11:48:24 ok, now i know what effect it has on the aircraft, with my original one the aircraft maintain better at low speeds but role left and right slower like in my video above with the new modification (remove some wing surface on the main wings and cover them with disconnector) it role left and right much faster but maintain at low speed is worse also fly faster.
creations-chat 2023-06-25 14:58:36 third test flight with some more modifications (mainly weapon racks and an external fuel tank)
creations-chat 2023-06-26 14:42:58 nearly done with my painting progress, I will finish painting all of the other exposed motor locks tomorrow.
creations-chat 2023-06-26 14:45:37 are you making the tornado?
creations-chat 2023-06-26 14:57:11 all 3 aircraft i have after nearly 1 year play this game, that F-14 looking plane is from a Thunderbird music video but it is not F-14, next is ME-262 HG III (it looks a little bit chunky), and my latest aircraft is the MIG-27.
creations-chat 2023-06-26 15:09:31 Well, i know my build are not good but that F-14 looking aircraft is not F-14
help 2023-07-13 09:24:44 guy how do i fix an unstable elevators, this thing is so annoying.
help 2023-07-13 09:26:07 Q-E (outside) and A-D (inside)
help 2023-07-13 09:27:24 it happen even on the ground or when fly at very very low speed
help 2023-07-13 09:29:02 that is what happened
help 2023-07-13 09:30:23 no it is not
help 2023-07-13 09:34:51 ok i will try ty
help 2023-07-13 09:35:19 i mean 1 to 5 only ?
help 2023-07-13 09:36:45 like this?
help 2023-07-13 09:37:37 oh ok got it
help 2023-07-13 09:38:57 haizz ya no hope
help 2023-07-13 09:39:15 Well right now I have two options: 1 sacrifice the maneuverability by deleting the turn motors and keeping the elevator motors and then using control surfaces to fix them later,  and 2 make everything more complicated by keep finding a solution for it.
help 2023-07-13 09:41:54 yep that is my option 1
help 2023-07-13 09:43:31 also my jet have 2 canard so i think it will improve the maneuverability a little bit.
help 2023-07-13 09:43:42 nah i just wanna using it to fly around
help 2023-07-13 09:46:42 got it
help 2023-07-13 09:47:25 ahh now i have a new problem
help 2023-07-13 09:47:55 but you know what i think we will talk about it later, right now i have to go so cya
help 2023-07-13 13:05:07 guy how do i fix my aircraft is supper wobble when flying
help 2023-07-13 14:03:12 ty
creations-chat 2023-07-13 14:45:34 texting my Mig-33 SS+ ( well I prefer simple things so I tried to make it not so complicated and although everything did work not so smoothly but at least they work well and yeah the future design cockpit is not so special, I think everyone can do the same thing too, I tried my best to hide the landing gears as much as I could)
creations-chat 2023-07-13 14:54:32 <@858278645760393216> ty
creations-chat 2023-07-13 15:10:40 Uhmm got it, I will try it tomorrow.
creations-chat 2023-07-14 01:04:01 Well, the aircraft basically turn very well without any support engines but if I delete all of the control surfaces it role worse, maintaining at a low speed also reduced and replacing them with disconnectors or trapdoors actually make it look better but do I need to add more support engines inside the aircraft to make it role better?
help 2023-07-14 08:54:41 Does anyone have a good aggressor for the mig-29?
creations-chat 2023-07-18 14:05:44 Yo guy i found the civilian version of the Su-34, look pretty cool to
creations-chat 2023-07-18 14:28:42 i think i will try to make it in the future
creations-chat 2023-07-18 14:33:17 let's see, this airliner can fly super fast and have a crew of 3 including 2 pilots and 1 stewardess and can carry 4 to 6 passengers I believe and maybe 2 to 4 or all of them are obese people because the su-34 can take a lot of weight.
creations-chat 2023-07-18 14:35:23 I think it can drop those passengers instead of bombs and extend the fly range by carrying 3 to 5 external fuel tanks.
