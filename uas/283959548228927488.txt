help 2021-05-17 14:35:08 I am trying to make a simple vehicle that hovers and I can lower and raise the height while still moving around. I've tried using the hover thrusters but generally I find myself losing control when I try to use thrusters to go left and right. Is there any way I can solve this issue?
help 2021-05-17 14:39:22 So if I make a perfectly balanced vehicle it should work fine?
