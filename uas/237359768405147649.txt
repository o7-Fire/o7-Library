creations-chat 2019-01-06 02:17:04 Here's it folded up
creations-chat 2019-03-31 01:21:45 is there are way to make a helicopter with 1 main rotor and 1 tail rotor?
creations-chat 2019-03-31 01:28:22 ok
creations-chat 2019-04-02 16:22:02 Requesting Rank Engineer, Technician, and/or Designer
Quadcopter/Drone with the capability of moving in pitch, yaw, and roll. It also has VTOL. It is 154 blocks. The camera (on the bottom of the drone) can also rotate.
creations-chat 2019-04-02 16:22:19 With camera rotated
creations-chat 2019-04-02 16:22:35 Block Count
creations-chat 2019-04-02 16:26:10 It's also capable of moving around 125 SPS
creations-chat 2019-04-02 21:09:37 you could add balloons so the missiles hit the balloons, this isn't the best idea tho
creations-chat 2019-04-04 17:50:54 could an octocopter count as an invention?
creations-chat 2019-04-04 17:55:28 ok
creations-chat 2019-04-04 19:26:46 Dodecacopter
creations-chat 2019-04-04 19:29:18 should it be dodecopter?
creations-chat 2019-04-04 19:36:40 idk what it would be called
creations-chat 2019-04-05 18:41:48 Made my dodecacopter into a helicarrier the can land small planes, with 2 run ways and 2 main storage areas (the smaller storage area are too small to count). Also has a ramp to go to and from the lower/upper deck.
creations-chat 2019-04-05 18:41:51 
creations-chat 2020-09-18 02:38:51 wait why did i immediately get a downvote on my helicopter?
creations-chat 2020-09-18 02:39:09 Well yeah it's ugly
creations-chat 2020-09-18 02:39:12 but it works sooo
creations-chat 2020-09-18 02:50:59 has anyone else built a decent helicopter?
the-dump 2020-09-18 02:53:43 > Thinking of making a helicopter tbh
<@!451330898521227265>  I have made a helicopter
creations-chat 2021-05-07 05:21:50 I would add a bigger hull but I‚Äôve maxed my height with how I did my bridge
creations-chat 2021-05-26 04:41:58 yeah I know : (, I thought real blades would look uglier
creations-chat 2021-05-26 17:13:13 <@!697786877444358186> Is there a YT tutorial somewhere on how to make a good cyclic system? I can't figure out how to make one.
creations-chat 2021-05-26 17:15:20 a good heli blade system that isn't 2 blades stacked on top of each other. also is the 2 minute slowmode for everyone?
creations-chat 2021-05-26 17:17:58 Yeah ik about the tail rotor problem, I've probably went through 20 designs/ideas for a heli blade that end up not working as well as I would have hoped.
help 2021-08-04 00:34:26 Is there a way to lock motor 2s?
help 2021-08-04 00:34:46 I want to get better at motor locking and it seems people can clip angled parts together
help 2021-08-04 00:42:46 I have a setup like this and I want those half slopes to be angled slightly in a particular way, but whenever I blow the TNT the motor 2s don't clip with each other. They mash together and counter act each other.
help 2021-08-04 00:44:09 Aight. Will I have to manually set the rotation then?
help 2021-08-04 00:45:28 The motors unlock when I rotate them. I want them to be rotated and put into place rather than just be put to place along an axis.
help 2021-08-04 00:47:55 Oh ok, cool
help 2021-08-04 00:50:55 They're not relocking
help 2021-08-04 00:51:06 Oh wait
help 2021-08-04 00:51:11 or do they not relock.....
help 2021-08-04 00:51:22 Wait they don't need too
help 2021-08-04 00:51:24 ty
creations-chat 2021-08-04 04:38:08 How do I make my comanche more stable
creations-chat 2021-08-04 04:40:21 u h h h h h not quite. It can get off the ground, but not very well
creations-chat 2021-08-04 04:44:56 
creations-chat 2021-08-04 04:59:10 I got it to fly
creations-chat 2021-08-04 05:32:04 Yeah it has a vertical stab and stuff, and more vertical control surfaces stuffed away in the hull
creations-chat 2021-08-04 05:46:21 I have windows I swear. I had a verified version, but when I got a new motherboard/processor it didn‚Äôt wanna verify anymore. You can also get keys for windows 10 off Ebay for $2 oh shit you guys weren‚Äôt talking to me
help 2021-08-04 22:35:23 AH-56 Cheyenne
help 2021-08-04 23:08:42 does anyone have a simple cyclic design? I really only want my helicopter to pitch
help 2021-12-20 02:32:02 So I have a heli here, and as soon as I attempt to take off, it makes a steep roll to the left. I've tried a lot of different things but I haven't been able to fix it. It is unflyable rn
help 2021-12-20 02:33:54 ok
help 2021-12-20 02:35:34 The blades are hooked to motor 2s and their all set to 10 degrees
help 2021-12-20 02:35:45 Also the non-wing-flapping thing didn't work
help 2021-12-20 02:37:35 ok I'll try that
help 2021-12-20 04:20:35 I'm still having this problem. The faster I go the worst it rolls to the left. Even trying to hover makes the helicopter roll
help 2021-12-20 04:34:09 Do the hover engines not work?
help 2021-12-20 04:35:36 Yeah that's why it's wierd
help 2021-12-20 04:36:23 It's a weird left roll im getting
help 2021-12-20 04:37:31 I mean I think I have a pretty decent understanding of helicopter physics, but the in game physics is what's getting me
help 2021-12-20 04:37:56 I don't need any counter torque mechanism due to the in-game physics
help 2021-12-20 04:38:25 And there's no unsymmetrical bits that would make my helicopter roll left slightly
help 2021-12-20 04:39:16 I've now added a tail rotor inline with the center of mass and that seems to not help counter act the roll, but I don't see how it would anyways
help 2021-12-20 05:13:03 yeah i know about cyclics and stuff
help 2021-12-20 05:14:04 I've even added sets of wings to the front and rear to help it not roll, but that still doesn't work even when moving forward
help 2021-12-20 05:14:52 it might just be the scale of my aircraft
help 2021-12-20 05:15:12 and the common methods don't work when they're miniaturized
help 2021-12-20 05:41:41 I thought having a engine powered rotor allowed me to not have a rear tail rotor or a co-ax rotor
help 2021-12-20 05:42:04 planes don't roll irregularly
creations-chat 2022-02-05 03:17:26 what colors
help 2022-02-16 05:23:50 how do you make a hover drive again? i forgor
