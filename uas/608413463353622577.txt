creations-chat 2020-11-19 00:59:41 I think he nailed it
creations-chat 2020-11-19 01:02:59 i see what you mean now maybe a 1 x 3 triangle wedge block would have suited it better

creations-chat 2020-11-19 02:56:25 <@456226577798135808> first of all make the cockpit less tall and longer make the top turret shorter aswell  Redo the bubble bomb sight and make the nose less tall while also removing the wedges that make it go down so steep on top of that redo the slope on the back of the cockpit to make it more gradual and shorter

GET THE GODDAMN PITCHFORKS BOYS
creations-chat 2020-12-04 19:26:58 it isnt round first of all

its also kind of flat

The landing gear dosent make much sense

The dome around the cockpit is not circular either

The propellors on the end should be hidden

Paint job is lazy

It is under detailed in general

Happy?
