creations-chat 2022-11-13 19:26:36 could you please elaborate?
creations-chat 2022-11-13 19:29:12 if i were to not post the creation, i wouldn't have learnt that.
the speed is because it's a tender, they don't go fast,
the color palette is as realistic as i managed to make it, in accordance to tenders of its time (dark-red bottom of the hull, black upper hull, white superstructure)
creations-chat 2022-11-13 19:33:40 thanks for that. what i meant by the color palette and design is the image below:
i do see what issues there are, though
-the bow isn't detailed, it's just wedges
-same goes for the stern
creations-chat 2022-11-13 19:36:44 i took a lot of inspiration from the ship above but i tried to make it have its own style thus the name, hull and funnel (or chimney) differences
creations-chat 2022-11-13 19:41:07 i see his point. people here are atleast skilled enough to use motorlock, while i go around using wedges and calling slightly smooth builds good
although there might have been a weird approach from him, atleast he helped me learn the issues that the ship has
help 2022-11-13 19:44:27 what do you mean by the trapdoors not working?

help 2022-11-14 05:44:11 Maybe it looks bland to you personally because that's your style of building. It happens sometimes.
