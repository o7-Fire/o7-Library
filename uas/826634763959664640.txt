creations-chat 2022-01-05 21:22:22 No one is required to give criticism, the whole point of the voting is to vote if you like it or not
creations-chat 2022-01-05 21:25:25 Chill?  All I did was respond to your statement that its rude to leave downvotes without constructive criticism, which it isn't.  If a build is bad in your opinion you downvote, if it's good in your opinion then you upvote.  You are not required at all to respond to the creator in feedback or give constructive criticism.
creations-chat 2022-01-05 21:27:48 I will give some constructive criticism though, there are control panels in the middle of the wings, the front is a little awkward with the half cylinder, and there are little gaps in the front between the disconnectors and half sphere.  The tail also looks a little weird along with the cockpit.  It's not that bad but its not really a great build either.
creations-chat 2022-01-05 21:31:05 Also whenever you post a build its good to give a few images of different angles, If you got a few different images of it and made some changes to make it look a little nicer I would definitely upvote.
creations-chat 2022-01-13 03:26:09 bro my mans posting that meanwhile i get banned for 3 days for saying d--z n---s
creations-chat 2022-01-13 03:28:43 wait is simple planes- plane crazy but not dogcrap????

creations-chat 2022-01-13 03:34:34 plane crazy expectations rising faster than global warming while plane crazy skilled players be receding faster than their hairlines can after sitting at their computers for 3 days straight working on a build

creations-chat 2022-01-13 03:50:18 plane crazy "experts" when they see something that they deem imperfect going into #buildfeedback to yell at the creator

creations-chat 2022-01-13 03:54:21 feedback in #feedback normally be like "YOUR BUILD SUCKS YOU SHOULD STOP PLAYING PLANE CRAZY FOREVER!!!! YOU SHOULD STOP PLAYING LIFE FOREVER!!!!!! YOU SUCK F YOU!!!!!"
creations-chat 2022-01-13 03:57:15 except people normally rage then immediately spam type out their angry comment at the creator, then sit in their chair venting for another 2 minutes before angrily spamming out another angry comment
creations-chat 2022-01-13 03:59:20 yea its probably for the best
creations-chat 2022-02-05 01:07:08 the v22 has paper wings and therefore build=trash change my mind    (plane crazy neckbeard review: based edition)

creations-chat 2022-02-11 22:09:55 i use fabric to see any angles that aren't lined up right ill change to metal or default
creations-chat 2022-02-25 15:34:25 paper wing airliner users digust me (its a joke idiot)
creations-chat 2022-02-25 15:37:12 I started out with paper wings and everyone does, the most I can say to Khalif is to go to college under  a study of advanced motor lock, piston lock, and camera lock techniques for the next 20 years of his life to make wing = angle, overall is fine if paper wing
creations-chat 2022-02-25 15:40:10 balls
creations-chat 2022-02-25 15:42:23 bro just because you used 3 motors doesnt mean your build is suddenly god tier, i also use motorlock and look what I made with a full interior (not even finished because plane crazy bricks when you have to many motor angles)
creations-chat 2022-02-25 15:44:41 you need a combination of skill AND motor locking, not just normal motor locking, need to add angle locking, and maybe even camera locking if the situation requires
creations-chat 2022-02-25 15:46:52 people rate build a lot depending on how blocky it is, the more custom angles that come together in a nice way, the higher the rating.  Your last build you posted here looks like i could make it in minecraft (you need a lot of skill to do it without, and you have to make a very large build)
creations-chat 2022-02-25 15:50:10 make sure you look into piston locking, or using pistons to move stuff slightly to make your build look better, camera locking, and angled motor locking.  also learn how to confine the ugly interior of pistons and motors that you use for the angles into a single small space, I confined almost the entire motor and camera locking parts for my build inside a single small room, then used texts and cameras to push and pull other parts into position before locking (you'll know your a real plane crazy pro when you can look at something and think how it could be made in plane crazy.  or when you start thinking up propeller designs in the shower like i did for my plane but we dont talk about that)
creations-chat 2022-02-25 15:52:40 is cancer, every kid comes to the discord server to post their newest and coolest build, after building it in a public server full of drooling shredder bug tutorial users and think its beautiful compared to them.  then they come here and see the real neckbeard plane crazy builders revealed
creations-chat 2022-02-25 16:01:17 haven't even finished it and in some places it doesn't look that good so I agree in some ways, but how exactly
creations-chat 2022-02-25 16:03:20 look for tutorials on angling with motors and then clipping, not just pure motors
creations-chat 2022-02-25 16:08:04 this other dude keeps posting the same truck but slightly tweaking it to farm likes bro (wip aint that bad compared to him)
creations-chat 2022-02-25 16:12:10 yea look in the bottom left corner, i can see those exposed angles
creations-chat 2022-02-25 16:16:21 balls
creations-chat 2022-02-25 16:18:26 Now i cant downvote because of the 1 slightly exposed motor bro, my life is ruined i cant be a neckbeard plane crazy user
creations-chat 2022-02-25 16:20:39 guys its rumored that if you say "deez knuts" 3 times the  plane crazy moderators will come out of the bushes and ban you
creations-chat 2022-02-25 16:23:07 i have a whitename but i cant get rid of it because everytime I make a large build in plane crazy with much motorlock plane crazy starts bugging out before i can finish and then i cry about it
creations-chat 2022-02-25 16:27:37 yea i literally have gotten to the point with one of my builds that each time i spawn it in i have a 50% chance of being kicked for "unexpected client behavior" has happened to me 20 times (anyways i gtg cya guys)
creations-chat 2022-02-25 19:16:33 ive looked at some of your builds in creations and ngl bro, the front of my plane cleaner than the front's of all joe jets combined
creations-chat 2022-02-25 19:18:41 ): you guys just trolling now
creations-chat 2022-02-25 19:20:45 how then bro its creations feedback after wait your a plane crazy neckbeard you don't know what feedback is
creations-chat 2022-02-25 19:24:09 dude doesnt understand what a tb3 is and that planes like that can actually fly + holes are gunners seats + planes in this era commonly looked like rectangles; also this wasnt meant to be a tb-3 but lightly based off of it
creations-chat 2022-02-25 19:26:48 Entire nosecone which you hate so much is somewhat based of a tb-3, also I just finished wings and they aren't weirdly shaped they just look like an actual planes wings, they may be a little thick but the tb-3's wings were about 2 meters thick
creations-chat 2022-02-25 19:29:23 It is lightly based of a tb3, im not crying because you guys don't know what it is, im crying because you guys saying its bad because it looks weird and im saying its not that bad its just based off of bombers of the era, wait bro i never said it was a tb3 i just said planes in tb3 era looked like that and compared some aspects of it to  a tb3
creations-chat 2022-02-25 19:32:13 Im go play warthunder because crying in creations feedback is not fun but on an ending note, it was never meant to be a tb3, never meant to say it was similar (bruhhhh) a tb3 and im sorry if it appeared that way, just was a custom bomber I made lightly based off of the tb3
creations-chat 2022-02-25 19:34:47 ok fine i get why it may haved seemed like it was a tb3 because of my immaculate typing and phrasing skills
creations-chat 2022-03-06 00:15:29 bro, what bombs???? theres just one large bomb and four small planes???
creations-chat 2022-03-08 00:37:33 go touch some grass mimi
creations-chat 2022-04-23 15:43:51 you either angle lock or have a ball that looks like it was made by a seizuring 8 year old playing with play-doh, no in between
