creations-chat 2019-03-10 02:27:11 i mean, im almost certain the carrier should be in the water
and the planes on the flight deck
but the flight deck is above the water so try not to have heavy aircraft land on it
creations-chat 2019-03-10 02:27:28 "Carrier Commando | Build an aircraft carrier capable of servicing aircraft. Entire flight deck must be above water in order to qualify. The aircraft carrier must be capable of moving around in the water."
