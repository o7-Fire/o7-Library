my technology is obsolete ree
plane-crazy 2020-03-12 03:35:18 my jet is the best jet, it contains a wooden propeller, and has no modern jet based technology in it
plane-crazy 2020-03-12 03:33:02 just use the search bar for 16 segment, its on one of my alts
plane-crazy 2020-03-12 03:32:26 people are becoming too advanced in this game, my 16 segment display is obsolete
plane-crazy 2020-03-12 03:17:20 id say a condor but i have plans to make one
plane-crazy 2020-03-12 02:04:13 yea, pretty much
plane-crazy 2020-03-12 01:56:59 the only concern id have for making a stapler is making functional staples
plane-crazy 2020-03-12 01:54:10 oof
plane-crazy 2020-03-12 01:53:39 however, i might have to make a staple remover as well
plane-crazy 2020-03-12 01:53:13 later sav, im not making one atm
plane-crazy 2020-03-12 01:52:51 german interceptor from ww2
plane-crazy 2020-03-12 01:52:34 dont ask
plane-crazy 2020-03-12 01:51:48 both ways work
plane-crazy 2020-03-12 01:51:43 it just moves the images around
plane-crazy 2020-03-12 01:51:17 so i googled
fw190 blueprint
blueprint of fw190
they're almost identical
plane-crazy 2020-03-12 01:49:33 yea i prolly should
plane-crazy 2020-03-12 01:49:26 (creation) blueprint also works for me
plane-crazy 2020-03-12 01:49:11 not saying ur making a stapler but still
plane-crazy 2020-03-12 01:48:44 im pretty sure its more like this
plane-crazy 2020-03-12 01:47:21 i dont think thats what he means by "type in blue print of (ur creation)"
plane-crazy 2020-03-12 01:46:20 as for pre built structures? no, they simply do not exist
plane-crazy 2020-03-12 01:45:30 literally just google a vehicle, then add the word blueprint after it
plane-crazy 2020-03-12 01:44:43 you google a blueprint, and you build it based on your knowledge of the blocks
plane-crazy 2020-03-12 01:41:40 google works for finding blueprints
plane-crazy 2020-03-12 01:40:34 ~~yes, delete the wedges~~

plane-crazy 2020-03-04 05:36:28 if u end up taking CIM, youll be learning GNM codes for CNC
plane-crazy 2020-03-04 05:35:33 pltw uses solidworks, inventor, and fusion
plane-crazy 2020-03-04 05:35:10 the modelling isnt the worst part, its keeping a signed and dated notebook for literally every action you do
plane-crazy 2020-03-04 05:34:16 no, still got computer integrated manufacturing and then EDD next year
plane-crazy 2020-03-04 05:33:55 oh i still was here, just never had a reason to talk
plane-crazy 2020-03-04 05:33:28 you see nothing
plane-crazy 2020-03-04 05:33:25 no, i dont exist
plane-crazy 2020-03-04 05:33:11 hm
plane-crazy 2020-02-21 08:01:50 i shouldve phrased "air push wing back after hitting ground" better bc its more like the air is being displaced by the wing, and some of the air gets moved downwards; since this air has no place to go due to the ground existing, it attempts to push back up against the wing, giving more lift to the craft
plane-crazy 2020-02-21 07:59:31 and some arent even planes
plane-crazy 2020-02-21 07:58:17 theres ALOT more but kinda yea
plane-crazy 2020-02-21 07:57:09 i mean, it doesnt have to be a plane but ehh
plane-crazy 2020-02-21 07:56:47 wing push air down, air push wing back after hitting ground
plane fly more
plane-crazy 2020-02-15 04:11:02 ono
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 04:43:30 with details
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 04:43:21 ballastic missile carriers
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 04:37:36 i do it to test the survivability of the aircraft, and partially to help the aim against other players
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 04:36:26 ~~is it normal to volunteer as target practice in pvp?~~
plane-crazy 2020-02-10 16:05:03 idk man
plane-crazy 2020-02-10 15:49:35 Maybe
plane-crazy 2020-02-07 03:17:43 for people with no context, its a Su-57
plane-crazy 2020-02-07 03:17:24 oh ok
plane-crazy 2020-02-06 05:03:25 ~~pontoons and glue~~
plane-crazy 2020-01-28 00:15:48 i might be able to measure one to yours
plane-crazy 2020-01-28 00:15:34 the small plane was measured for my own ship, that i stopped building a while back
plane-crazy 2020-01-28 00:14:46 uhhhh
plane-crazy 2020-01-28 00:14:42 oh
plane-crazy 2020-01-27 23:59:42 how small does this biplane need to be...
plane-crazy 2020-01-02 21:10:01 and yes, im still alive
plane-crazy 2020-01-02 21:08:56 so basically, i should start development of a ap munition
plane-crazy 2019-11-15 06:47:07 yes?
plane-crazy 2019-11-12 15:29:17 actually wait, 10 hours
plane-crazy 2019-11-12 15:29:07 and ill see yall in about 8 hours
plane-crazy 2019-11-12 15:28:50 <@!496809137078927361> ill leave this for you if u need it
plane-crazy 2019-11-12 15:23:40 i recommend taking pics when im on bc i got about 7 minuites before i leave for school
plane-crazy 2019-11-12 15:22:59 alr
plane-crazy 2019-11-12 15:22:47 bc i migth join to show u the mechanism
plane-crazy 2019-11-12 15:22:39 username?
plane-crazy 2019-11-12 15:22:29 do you happen to be in a server rn?
plane-crazy 2019-11-12 15:21:37 the thing evolved to this thing
plane-crazy 2019-11-12 15:20:55 yea
plane-crazy 2019-11-12 15:20:48 the older variant
plane-crazy 2019-11-12 15:20:25 i use the bolt to actually load the round into the chamber
plane-crazy 2019-11-12 15:20:12 ah
plane-crazy 2019-11-12 15:19:51 do you need a slide/bolt?
plane-crazy 2019-11-12 15:19:15 hmm
plane-crazy 2019-11-12 15:17:21 depends, what are you shooting, how big is the projectile etc
plane-crazy 2019-11-12 15:16:49 isnt it like post scriptum or something
plane-crazy 2019-11-11 19:28:39 guess ill join vip1 with my primary
plane-crazy 2019-11-11 19:27:53 i dont know which account my uboat is in reeee
plane-crazy 2019-11-11 19:27:30 i used to be there, but noone was there either
plane-crazy 2019-11-11 19:20:14 ~~i dont have a phone so i have to resort to using a webcam to take pictures~~
plane-crazy 2019-11-11 19:18:42 sure
plane-crazy 2019-11-11 19:18:40 oh ok
plane-crazy 2019-11-11 19:18:20 sure, go for it, i dont even own a phone
plane-crazy 2019-11-11 19:17:27 now, im either on my calculator playing games and procrastinating hw, or playing PC or MC
plane-crazy 2019-11-11 19:15:30 i cant build vehicles. i only stick to simple mechanics now and concepts
plane-crazy 2019-11-11 19:14:44 my first build was a jet with an ejector seat. lets just say it worked but was sluggish
plane-crazy 2019-11-11 19:13:28 i have literally every build from when i first joined to now all stored in 40 or so alts
plane-crazy 2019-11-11 19:12:55 the gun is a failure tho, it works, but its a failure
plane-crazy 2019-11-11 19:12:14 rn im not in game bc im drawing schematics to transfer it to anotehr acc
plane-crazy 2019-11-11 19:11:36 why?
plane-crazy 2019-11-11 19:11:31 no
plane-crazy 2019-11-11 19:09:51 this was the first variant
plane-crazy 2019-11-11 19:09:07 jams hella easily
plane-crazy 2019-11-11 19:08:48 dual mag, psuedo shell ejecting mag gun
plane-crazy 2019-11-11 19:07:59 and tbh, i dont build much anymore, lost hope in trying to make things work. only things i work on now is mag guns
plane-crazy 2019-11-11 19:07:02 i dont participate in comps
and oh
plane-crazy 2019-11-11 19:06:33 such as?
plane-crazy 2019-11-11 19:06:00 but hey, some of us are poor

plane-crazy 2019-11-11 19:04:44 4gb ram, 54 mods works just as fine for me
plane-crazy 2019-11-05 04:08:22 ok i should really shut up
plane-crazy 2019-11-05 04:08:09 ***when u realize the AP Physics Exam is on the same day as the AP US History***
plane-crazy 2019-11-05 04:07:15 apparently im allowed to use the calculator on the AP Language Exam, i should do it
plane-crazy 2019-11-05 04:05:52 here, supposed to be hear
plane-crazy 2019-11-05 04:05:46 ree

plane-crazy 2019-11-05 04:01:59 satellite phones are SURELY better for portability.
plane-crazy 2019-11-05 04:00:37 damn, i only got a samsung sgh a877 slide phone
plane-crazy 2019-11-05 03:59:55 ehh whatever, thats what i learned. if its false, my life existance is false

plane-crazy 2019-07-06 04:48:52 whats water. we in a drought still... technically
plane-crazy 2019-07-06 04:48:22 so NASA JPL's wind tunnel with the ocean and spin fast
plane-crazy 2019-07-06 04:47:48 so basically NASA JPL wind tunnels except big
plane-crazy 2019-07-06 04:47:30 oh ok
plane-crazy 2019-07-06 04:47:09 whats a tornado. i live in CA

plane-crazy 2019-07-06 04:46:28 also name
plane-crazy 2019-07-06 04:46:00 how many times do i gotta say. 9.0 expected by the 19th
plane-crazy 2019-07-06 04:00:03 BRUH we just finished an earthquake and someone's firing off spare FIREWORKS
plane-crazy 2019-07-06 03:56:20 im over in AC's discord server debating what would the US do about the nuclear warheads in vandenburg airforce
plane-crazy 2019-07-06 03:47:05 just build a bridge
plane-crazy 2019-07-06 03:46:20 just not 48 connected states
plane-crazy 2019-07-06 03:46:11 we probably still will
plane-crazy 2019-07-06 03:45:50 bruh, its just gonna be a large river

plane-crazy 2019-07-06 03:39:42 watch, another one tmw
plane-crazy 2019-07-06 03:39:26 bc 6.8 was about 11 miles. and it diminishes fast
plane-crazy 2019-07-06 03:39:07 im assuming about 22-26
plane-crazy 2019-07-06 03:36:25 anti, how many miles from ridgecrest?
plane-crazy 2019-07-06 03:33:17 jeez i feel bad for ridgecrest
it was a 5.4 earlier today and it grew to a 7.1
5.3 at 4AM
7.1 at 8PM
plane-crazy 2019-07-06 03:32:09 hmmm
plane-crazy 2019-07-06 03:31:23 ik but. if the shaking has been continuous for 15 minutes and going. is it an aftershock?
plane-crazy 2019-07-06 03:30:47 i can still feel the ground moving ever so slightly
plane-crazy 2019-07-06 03:30:22 ITS STILL GOING ON REEE
plane-crazy 2019-07-06 03:29:49 VI. Felt by all, many frightened. Some heavy furniture moved; a few instances of fallen plaster. Damage slight.

VII. Damage negligible in buildings of good design and construction; slight to moderate in well-built ordinary structures; considerable damage in poorly built or badly designed structures; some chimneys broken.

VIII. Damage slight in specially designed structures; considerable damage in ordinary substantial buildings with partial collapse. Damage great in poorly built structures. Fall of chimneys, factory stacks, columns, monuments, walls. Heavy furniture overturned.
more detail
plane-crazy 2019-07-06 03:28:50 but officially its 7.1
plane-crazy 2019-07-06 03:28:42 it felt somewhat like a 6.8 where i was
plane-crazy 2019-07-06 03:28:05 felt that from south of LA
plane-crazy 2019-07-06 03:27:40 this is the most recent one reported apparently
plane-crazy 2019-07-06 03:24:31 SOuth CA for me
plane-crazy 2019-07-06 03:23:57 its tsill happeneing for me
plane-crazy 2019-07-06 03:23:29 yknow, i hate eathquakes when it interrupts your work
plane-crazy 2019-07-04 17:44:28 ah yes another 3 sec aftershock
plane-crazy 2019-07-04 17:43:25 oof 4.2 sec aftershock
plane-crazy 2019-07-04 17:42:33 my monitor fell over
plane-crazy 2019-07-04 17:42:11 Bruh, 34 sec. earthquake. near LA for me
plane-crazy 2019-06-28 02:54:18 -0
plane-crazy 2019-06-28 01:20:12 hmm. ive been decieved by others
plane-crazy 2019-06-28 01:17:23 no
plane-crazy 2019-06-28 01:08:38 i need to learn how to use the surface motors ree
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 20:42:58 *without the blades, landing gear, bay doors or the back*
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 20:42:32 dont worry my small engine took me like 1 hour 50 minutes
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 20:40:33 having background with 3d modelling helps, especially blender
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 20:39:58 so did i at the beginning
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 20:36:48 also fonkl, i already died
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 20:35:56 yes, yes i did <@163143541160148992>
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 20:30:04 why waste my time on astrocraft? im taking a small break from PC for a moment
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 20:29:27 exactly
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 20:29:11 dont ask why
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 17:21:43 hmm
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 04:57:34 and this is the hub
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 04:56:55 this is all i see
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 04:56:14 you drink strong juice, then mango, then die from strong juice
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 04:55:58 but it doesnt work if you reset
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 04:55:46 even after drinking it
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 04:55:40 we also managed to keep the effect of the mango juice
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 04:55:08 this is what astrocraft's sun looks like if you drink the mango juice
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 03:24:49 im just not well recognized bc all i did is cicuitry for inventing stuff
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 03:24:13 hey i talk most days
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 02:51:49 but not to scale cuz the build limit
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 02:51:31 but im busy rn'
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 02:51:26 thought about it
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 02:47:02 proportions are wrong
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 02:46:58 World's shittiest bf-109
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 01:04:32 bruh this is astrocraft
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 01:03:50 i prefer conventionals like solidworks not f3x, this is only the second time ive used f3x
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 01:03:08 i rly hate f3x sometimes
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 01:02:59 bruh i spent so long making this
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 00:19:32 bruh i should make a corsair or some old plane in astrocraft for absolutely no reason
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 00:19:01 just to see how many ppl recognize it
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 00:18:54 i plan to remake the cantilever LIGHT freighter again
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 00:18:28 someone has made the liset prime earlier
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 00:18:18 the liset?
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 00:18:00 oh its kaiyon, i heard that theres a faction dispute going on rn
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 00:16:49 is it unfair that im certified in the CSWA and CSWP?
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 00:15:53 ppl get detailed with it
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 00:09:47 hydra was here earlier (as well as another detailed builder that i forogt the name of)
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 00:09:25 and i know how detailed ppl can get
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 00:09:15 legendary, give me a break ive had 30 minutes of f3x. thats it. its the first time i used it
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 00:05:11 managed to reset tho
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 00:04:23 i physically cant press projects or editor so im stuck like this
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 00:02:39 im cambodian american, but at the same time america planeted 500k landmines in cambodias forests
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 00:02:09 yes cambodia
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 00:02:05 thats all i have to say
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 00:01:52 Cambodia and landmines
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 00:01:44 although im american, i have a good reason to dislike america
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 00:01:00 why am i just watching this
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 23:59:31 who said im not the counter weight? (~~even tho i weigh 109lbs at 16years of age~~)
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 23:58:10 oof
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 23:57:58 what if i am the trebuchet
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 23:57:21 so if i went to the airport, i would be arrested for bringing a small child correct?
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 23:56:54 does that mean a 9y/o can become an anti aircraft projectile?
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 23:56:01 im sorry but i will now call trebuchets' trench buckets (im not actually gonna do that)
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 23:55:17 trench bucket
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 23:54:52 the ship thats dying rn is a Mk.VI Medium Interceptor "Trident"
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 23:54:21 trident is my interceptors name
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 23:53:29 the only missile name i can think of is Black Trident but it sound more like a fighter
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 23:52:54 uhh
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 23:52:31 and i cant do anything about it
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 23:52:27 well. im slowly becoming one polygon
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 23:51:55 if you look at the back section, youll see the polygons have begun
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 23:50:20 ill be back when i become a polygon
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 23:50:01 all the parts are now starting to move around, like the polygon area of PC
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 23:49:12 
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 23:48:51 now*
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 23:48:47 correction im not at XYZ coords (163,334 ; 2,734,432 ; -1,376,009)
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 23:47:47 ye well, i am going 43k st/s
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 23:47:28 hydra touched me ONCE
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 23:47:17 and the speed
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 23:47:14 look at the pos
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 23:47:08 bc he needs to see this
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 23:46:45 is battle here by any chance?
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 21:05:43 what if i sleep at 10 pm and wake up at 3 pm the previous day
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 21:02:50 i slep at 10pm wake up at 8am
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 21:02:22 my disc is dying reee
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 21:01:49 even if its EST
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 21:01:42 what im more concerned about is, why u eating dinner at 2PM PST
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 16:26:16 nope apparently shift x is just delete
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 16:26:00 im still new to f3x
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 16:25:38 and try shift c
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 16:25:34 undo that
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 16:25:31 uhhhh
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 16:25:23 then get ur move tool
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 16:25:14 shift x
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 16:25:01 like how selection boxes work
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 16:24:50 drag ur mouse over it <@!255361087262818304>
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 16:23:52 i cant import rblx id's
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 16:23:47 nvm, i found it. you literally click the item and click the mesh tool
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 16:22:14 i dont know what colors/colours to give this. and how does the mesh tool work
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 16:21:13 <@!255361087262818304> no, not yet sadly
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 16:13:58 dark, define ur definition of fix
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 16:07:05 last i left i was 56
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 16:06:45 its actually shit
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 16:06:20 so this is my first time using F3X... its shit
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 16:05:08 sometimes
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 16:04:43 better than how i started
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 05:18:49 hmm. well ima sleep i got cbrn training tmw cuz reasons dont ask why
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 05:17:00 xd
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 05:16:44 yes
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 05:16:07 i own too much air
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 05:15:07 bruh why is it 87deg F at night still REE
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 05:13:28 or uhhhhhh, study the factory stats of bending sheet metal
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 05:12:36 or learn how to use a manual lathe
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 05:11:59 uhhhh
take CNC Mill lessons
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 05:11:21 become not bored
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 05:08:45 thats why i should buy the stand. and make myself in debt
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 05:08:13 EXACTLY
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 05:07:32 i should buy the stand but not the monitor or anything. just the stand... for absolutely no reason even tho im broke
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 05:03:17 and when i say multisim hates mac os, you cant get an installer for macosx multisim
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 05:01:56 mac os is decent
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 05:01:43 tried. tbh. it made it worse
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 05:01:14 i only use windows for 2 reasons
Multisim hates MacOS (Circuit Design Software)
SOLIDWORKS hates MacOS
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 05:00:05 i could if i wanted to
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 04:58:29 so what ur saying is i should launch BootCamp and switch to MacOSX?
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 04:57:39 ehh
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 04:56:45 i use TOR
but then again i just want privacy but i still dont believe TOR gives complete privacy
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 04:56:23 thats why i dont use chrome
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 04:56:15 yet*
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 04:56:12 ye
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 04:56:08 hmm. TOR didnt crash
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 04:55:34 exactly
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 04:55:23 BET
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 00:46:20 100% didnt click universe by accident
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 00:45:58 you saw nothing battleship
plane-crazy 2019-06-25 02:55:07 m60 is better (for me)
but colt lmg is good substitute until you get m60
plane-crazy 2019-06-25 02:54:27 its actually quite effective
plane-crazy 2019-06-25 02:54:19 and like no joke. yes i snipe with the m60 vcog full auto
plane-crazy 2019-06-25 02:53:59 the spread is ~~horrific~~ WONDERFUL
plane-crazy 2019-06-25 02:53:39 USE A DAMN FULL AUTO M60 WITH A VCOG
plane-crazy 2019-06-25 02:44:21 bruh m60 with vcog full auto is better
plane-crazy 2019-06-25 02:42:09 hmm i caught stream at the right moment again. 6 minutes from landing
last time i was 2 minutes after soyuz's departure
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 06:21:15 yes we know trollers have cons
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 06:19:50 i wont
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 06:17:29 barrel-less armored fighting vehicles
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 06:00:29 both could carry the same payload
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 06:00:22 the F-15 only beat it becasue it was 300mph faster than the F16XL
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 05:57:42 OOF, apparently they also put the engine slightly off center.... TOWARDS the side with more weight
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 05:56:06 asymmetrical
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 05:55:25 lemme find a better pic
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 05:55:02 laminar flow experiments by nasa
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 05:54:46 
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 05:54:42 the f16xl
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 05:54:30 also its asymmetrical actually
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 05:54:07 bc it IS a f16
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 05:54:00 The General Dynamics F-16XL is a derivative of the F-16 Fighting Falcon, with a cranked-arrow delta wing. It was originally conceived as a technology demonstrator, later entered in the United States Air Force's (USAF) Enhanced Tactical Fighter (ETF) competition but lost to the F-15E Strike Eagle.
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 05:53:59 first sentence of wikipedia bc im too lazy to get an actual source
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 05:52:33 wait hmmm
you said yours is a F-15?
then technically im building the plane that was beaten by the F-15 during the ETF competition
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 05:50:56 also that plane is a failure of this
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 05:50:02 so it ejects and pulls the chute immediately
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 05:49:52 ehh, i keybind my spring to my parachute button
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 05:48:58 ehh, ive slowed down a video (i sadly do not have it anymore) the plane goes beneath the seat, meaning i technically dont impact the plane when ejecting
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 05:48:33 use springs
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 05:47:42 same, except it uses the player parachute physics
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 05:46:42 ill prolly buy it later
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 05:46:31 id buy the jetpack but i dont play PC much anymore
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 05:45:43 such is the life of making compact ejector seats
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 05:45:31 ehh
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 05:44:11 now heres the thing. i dont use first person often and besides i wont use first person until i can make another simulated hud
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 05:43:11 its just a motor and a 0.9 block
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 05:42:31 also because reasons, gear bay doors
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 05:32:14 at first i was tryna build the F-16XL Laminar Flow Experiment aircraft but idek
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 05:22:16 all that i know is canopy
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 05:21:25 tbh, i dont know what im building
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 19:45:20 its 32GB but tthis is old stuff that i dont need anymore
mostly Multisim and SOLIDWORKS/Inventor Files
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 19:43:54 ree i have to transfer 14 GB of stuff to clear my flashdrive but its going at 14 bytes a second
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 19:41:14 not that im rich enough to afford anything.
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 19:40:46 just use a mac pro to support the mac pro
plane-crazy 2019-06-15 19:54:46 i have the urge to make the object that Grab described.
plane-crazy 2019-06-15 19:33:15 i need mental help i used a fork to drink one cup of milk
plane-crazy 2019-06-15 17:25:41 idk whats happening over there im just in my own area
plane-crazy 2019-06-15 17:19:57 hmm
plane-crazy 2019-06-13 01:36:14 except it loops at the beginning and at the bottom. otherwise its literally a two.
plane-crazy 2019-06-13 01:20:49 i might join u if i get bored of hw.
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 21:45:40 cave dig simulator
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 21:45:02 minecraft
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 21:44:36 minteos
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 21:44:21 what is that?
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 21:43:40 because water exists
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 21:43:03 ~~an oreo emote~~
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 21:41:55 i dip my oreos into the molten plastic it came with
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 21:41:11 i use watered down oreos. ~~i dont regret saying this~~
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 21:40:23 whats an oreo.
then again... whats milk
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 21:31:40 okay
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 21:30:58 what is going on here?
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 23:52:46 o ok
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 05:43:01 e
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 03:18:07 not on the disc
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 03:18:01 you cant find it under the phrase sir legless bc thats what they call me in game
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 03:17:33 the BAI community nicknamed me Sir Legless because of it, if u search the discord's archives
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 03:16:47 crouched*
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 03:16:39 why do i ask, i was a person that for some damn reason, never had legs. in which if i ever crounded i would fall under the map
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 03:15:59 oh wait, i wonder did they fix the bug in which for SOME CHARACTERS, IN EVERY GAME THE JOINED, they would lose their legs
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 03:15:13 I dont mind the reload for rifleman
i trained with it so ehh
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 03:14:13 ehh, raided him enough
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 03:13:46 hmmmm. ~~i refuse to talk about aegon jsyk~~
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 03:12:47 yes, you did, scroll up
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 03:12:11 some of em
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 03:12:09 well
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 03:12:06 in the game the rifleman is under skirmishers so ehh
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 03:11:50 Rifleman, Skirmisher. Same Concept
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 03:11:38 Also Am i the only one who prefers to use the Rifleman Class over others in BAI
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 03:10:26 well, NAND NOT (Hex Inverters) and NOR
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 03:10:08 NAND and NOT Gates
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 03:10:00 next step
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 03:08:59 VERY rudimentary 8 input AOI SSI circuit utilizing 6 rudimentary or gates and one rudimentary and gate
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 03:07:10 hmmm, i might join bc i havent fired a musket in roblox since a month ago so might as well
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 03:05:43 SOLID ROCKET BOOSTERS
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 02:58:02 this is the gate im currently working on, a rudimentary AND gate
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 02:54:40 im on a 9 player server
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 02:54:28 ill probably hook this after a while to a rudimentary multiplexer
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 02:53:50 bruh if rudimentary gates are this large, no
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 02:53:08 now to make an AND gate
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 02:40:29 
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 02:40:26 literally the simplest AOI OR Gate Implementation i could complete
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 02:15:51 registration date is this year HMM, few months ago
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 02:08:22 In Cambodia, if it rains. its at most 4 hours intervals. 3 days apart
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 02:07:25 106 humid in shade is pretty much an average day for me now that ive visited relatives in cambodia
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 02:06:41 Warm and Dry im fine with but not warm and humid
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 02:06:19 Cambodia, Heat, and Humidity are three things that never go well
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 02:05:27 Go to cambodia. its worse there
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 02:05:07 76% humidity.. not too bad
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 02:04:40 83.5F indoors isnt much
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 02:04:22 ehh. its only humid
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 02:04:05 Anti, i live Southern Cali
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 01:55:05 i never intended to get inventor but noone made a 16  segment display at the time so ehh
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 01:53:12 not nothing, but VERY few.
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 01:51:51 i should knock out another inventor-esk thing but ill still procrastinate on it
but its just stuff similar to what is shown in <#497142796961054721> , because i know for a fact (i have some prototypes lying around) that logic gates can be made with unpowered motors
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 01:44:48 and then you notice the player name
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 01:44:01 dousing something or Do Use
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 01:43:25 hmmmmmm
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 01:38:25 HMM
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 01:05:48 even with the eggs i do have, i wont ever use them.. and prolly rarely change my avatar
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 01:05:07 ehh... just something that happens and passes. not a big deal
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 01:04:08 oof, i only got half bc i mainly didnt give a damn about it
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 01:02:56 hmm BAI
~~the only reason why i have a napoleonic uniform~~
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 00:59:41 hmm whats this
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 21:51:42 can u fill a bean... with beans?
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 21:50:13 is this what happens when im not home? is this the odd world the discord is when im not home
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 21:48:18 there is no "u" in "whatever action above carries to the person above and below me"
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 21:47:57 but which "u"
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 21:47:03 whatever action above carries to the person above and below me
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 06:19:15 that moment when u realize youve been typing an essay on Notepad and not Word
plane-crazy 2019-06-09 22:48:43 oh, that the only thing i havent landed a an 225 on and successfully taken back off of
plane-crazy 2019-06-09 01:56:56 aight
plane-crazy 2019-06-09 01:56:32 ok i wont ask how
why?
plane-crazy 2019-06-08 00:13:40 use a third party source and walk close to 0 but not at 0
plane-crazy 2019-06-08 00:12:36 HMM
plane-crazy 2019-06-08 00:11:24 hmm. i saw my mouse flicker on that so hmm
plane-crazy 2019-06-08 00:10:25 
plane-crazy 2019-06-08 00:08:58 
plane-crazy 2019-06-08 00:08:39 i already posted it, at the end of these messages is a transparent pixel
plane-crazy 2019-06-08 00:08:07 here you go
plane-crazy 2019-06-08 00:07:51 wait on
plane-crazy 2019-06-08 00:07:26 yes people are in vip1
plane-crazy 2019-06-08 00:07:18 hmm. i found a transparent pixel in my files
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 23:58:38 uhhhhh.. i use GIMP only so i can get transparent backgrounds
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 23:58:12 just go into options and make that light grey the transparency filter
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 23:57:27 idk, i might get into the server tho
plane-crazy 2019-06-06 23:32:17 Gay, they forogt the extra blade !!!!111!///
plane-crazy 2019-06-06 23:31:42 FoRnIIe
plane-crazy 2019-06-06 23:27:42 you CAN. i dont know how but overall... you dont
plane-crazy 2019-06-06 16:14:31 i mean. i have a kinda decent WACO CG-4A Glider.
plane-crazy 2019-06-06 05:19:32 hmmmm. its been a while since i heard gunpoint
plane-crazy 2019-06-05 05:07:18 i can get pics another day. preferably 2 days from now
plane-crazy 2019-06-05 05:06:51 side note it only takes 2 jet engines. no helium no ballast. and 3 prop engines (im too lazy to add actual control surfaces) to fly the damn glider
plane-crazy 2019-06-05 04:41:43 theres only one thing left to do. put engines on it and watch it crash and burn
plane-crazy 2019-06-05 04:39:20 time to launch roblox and have discord die again
plane-crazy 2019-06-05 04:38:18 originally i was gonna make it 200 blocks exact but then i got lazy and didnt try to
plane-crazy 2019-06-05 04:37:25 Made with 68 disconnectors
plane-crazy 2019-06-05 04:37:01 according to COM, COL and overall mass. it should fly.. if it wasnt a glider

plane-crazy 2019-05-08 22:02:58 so i guess this is what people do
plane-crazy 2019-05-08 22:02:45 ogod
plane-crazy 2019-05-08 22:02:20 i heard a scream when i joined
plane-crazy 2019-05-08 22:01:28 ok
plane-crazy 2019-05-08 22:01:10 uhhhhhh
plane-crazy 2019-05-08 02:01:16 and yes, the rounds are spin stabilized, and thats like the only purpose of that gun.
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 22:31:25 i think the tpo view will look the best
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 22:28:42 concerns about why its flooded
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 22:28:10 no i did not
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 22:27:58 seems legit
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 22:27:36 its called loading
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 22:26:25 yes
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 22:26:05 ew its above ground
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 22:23:23 integex's looks more like a tavern
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 22:23:03 but i agree b0xel's house looks better
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 22:22:38 oof, i have never built a surface house in minecraft =/
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 22:05:21 grab teach me your ways so i can make that damned calico magazine
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 22:02:08 yes
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 16:04:30 ok i go now
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 16:04:20 besides, i can play plane crazy from my bed without worrying about wire contraints
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 16:03:36 the only usb port is BEHIND the mac mini so ehh
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 16:02:22 get*
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 16:02:18 i agree with neut, the wires bet annoying
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 03:41:18 snopping tool?
plane-crazy 2019-05-04 23:37:23 and the barrel isnt meant to fire a seat
plane-crazy 2019-05-04 23:37:07 so that makes me wonder what speed the round goes
plane-crazy 2019-05-04 23:36:36 
plane-crazy 2019-05-04 23:36:33 if the gun is angled at this angle, it land where the x is
plane-crazy 2019-05-04 23:34:55 only problem, the actually get a round to launch, i need 3 different stages of mags
the first stage is activating QE (the mags that spin, the actual mag that propels the round), the second BN (the mags to push the round into the QE mags), and keypad12 (to stop jamming of the mag)
plane-crazy 2019-05-04 23:32:22 yeah, basically
plane-crazy 2019-05-04 23:31:55 looks ugly but launches stable rounds, (when i say stable i mean only rotation is roll)
plane-crazy 2019-05-04 23:20:10 idk but it works
plane-crazy 2019-05-04 23:02:55 odd gun design, but it spins the round like rifling... by spinning the launch mags
plane-crazy 2019-05-04 22:20:50 oof, the carrier in the picture, i have a decent plane that can fit on it, its decently small, im not asking to join but im just saying i can
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 05:36:30 dont u hate it when ur keyboard died so u use the onscreen keyboard with autocomplete
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 03:26:35 it belonged to cessna originally
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 03:15:16 hmm
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 03:10:11 yeah, basically
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 03:09:45 kelvin
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 03:06:22 imperial, you mean the country that put about 200k landmines in our forests

plane-crazy 2019-05-03 02:34:54 technically i invented the 16 seg bc i had school issues

plane-crazy 2019-04-30 03:58:46 side note: i am aware this is <#384021699466756107> and not <#504436696021204992> , i sparsingly put creations i build in creations chat anyways, even tho some of them qualify for ranks
plane-crazy 2019-04-30 03:58:29 also without reverse thrust, it takes about 1-2 plots after touchdown to completely stop rolling forwards
plane-crazy 2019-04-30 03:56:34 
plane-crazy 2019-04-30 03:55:43 also ngl it flies decently even if the wings are folded
plane-crazy 2019-04-30 03:55:17 
plane-crazy 2019-04-30 03:55:11 i made this bc i was bored, an E/A-18G Growler
plane-crazy 2019-04-28 20:07:25 uhh neutro, if you would find Bellflower Blvd. and take a right on Lakewood Ave. You should find a costco. you can buy vegetable oil there
plane-crazy 2019-04-28 19:34:27 i cant explain it
