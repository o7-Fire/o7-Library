creations-chat 2018-12-23 08:04:29 I'm going to request:

- Expert Steampunk Engineer: The design CAN be lifted using only helium, I just have the propellers there because I want some form of moving part. Makes it look cooler.
- Master Technician: The design CAN take off or land vertically, and it's NOT a helicopter.
- Modeller: This is a stretch, but it's a unique design. Not Jameson unique, but unique. Two large tubes on either side, with 4 blades per tube, and two massive props on the back for thrust. But again, this one ***IS*** a stretch
