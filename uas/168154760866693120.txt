plane-crazy 2020-03-12 06:52:58 Cause it hurts my head to try and understand what the goal of this creation is.
plane-crazy 2020-03-12 06:52:43 Or, more or less what it does
plane-crazy 2020-03-12 06:52:24 <@!176455791992242176> Can you PLEASE explain to me how in the **FUCK** this works?...
plane-crazy 2020-03-12 06:51:57 http://prntscr.com/rf46iz

plane-crazy 2020-02-20 10:40:45 He clearly is too headass to understand
plane-crazy 2020-02-20 10:40:36 Like mods have seen it in the past?
plane-crazy 2020-02-20 10:40:30 not understand that a past exists?

plane-crazy 2020-02-20 10:35:42 I can post a shit tank because i want to show people how <:sped:598677949989912722> it is
plane-crazy 2020-02-20 10:35:25 nah you dont like it
plane-crazy 2020-02-20 10:35:22 but the logic here is if you like a creation you build
plane-crazy 2020-02-20 10:35:13 they should upvote it because they like it
plane-crazy 2020-02-20 10:35:05 and they like it
plane-crazy 2020-02-20 10:35:02 is that if someone built something
plane-crazy 2020-02-20 10:34:55 the ironic part
plane-crazy 2020-02-20 10:30:58 bug off
plane-crazy 2020-02-20 10:30:55 So you guys are tryna get me in trouble when you cant even back your shit up
plane-crazy 2020-02-20 10:30:45 and NONE OF THEM have said anything.
plane-crazy 2020-02-20 10:30:36 Legit in <#544722974574379021> ALL the mods have seen it
plane-crazy 2020-02-20 10:30:29 there's nothing NSFW in it dude
plane-crazy 2020-02-20 10:30:08 fixed
plane-crazy 2020-02-20 10:30:05 boom

plane-crazy 2020-02-20 10:28:53 My PFP isn't NSFW in any form, nor is it a loli
plane-crazy 2020-02-20 10:28:44 rule 2
plane-crazy 2020-02-20 10:28:43 I'm confused as to what these idiots are screaming about
plane-crazy 2020-02-20 10:27:08 fuk u <@!557172100545249281>
plane-crazy 2019-12-19 22:21:42 Then the day before he spoke in here
plane-crazy 2019-12-19 22:21:31 In <#529858892075761694>
plane-crazy 2019-12-19 22:21:23 Last time mad spoke was September 28th
plane-crazy 2019-12-19 22:19:39 Then he has less motivation to work on PC because of the other person
plane-crazy 2019-12-19 22:19:27 With how little mad seems to care for PC, if Rick can’t stand working with this dev, he’s stuck with it
plane-crazy 2019-12-19 22:19:00 But in terms of the people.
plane-crazy 2019-12-19 22:18:56 It would help with getting things fixed or updated
plane-crazy 2019-12-19 22:18:41 I don’t know if having another dev would be good or not
plane-crazy 2019-12-19 22:18:16 Well tbh idk if any other dev would be good. Yeah it seems like rick has a lot but he interacts with the community and puts thing in that interests the community
plane-crazy 2019-12-19 22:16:40 And he’s the only person working on it
plane-crazy 2019-12-19 22:16:30 A decently big game, probably the biggest sandbox game out there on Roblox
plane-crazy 2019-12-19 22:16:16 I kinda feel bad for rick
plane-crazy 2019-12-19 22:15:21 In Stormworks I have over 60 hours already invested and I got the game December 3rd I think,
plane-crazy 2019-12-19 22:14:51 Right now my current building game craze is Stormworks. Steam game that has a creative mode to it.
plane-crazy 2019-12-19 22:14:30 Plane crazy is also fun, but my motivation to get on and build is so low. I don’t know what to make, and no one ever has good ideas. I find t hard to get motivation to build.
plane-crazy 2019-12-19 22:13:51 Well I only played the sandbox mode and not often
plane-crazy 2019-12-19 22:13:17 WFYB was a genuinely fun game. I liked it. But when you want to make anything advanced it takes to long so fucking do. And it’s irritating
plane-crazy 2019-12-19 22:12:34 What the fuck does ama mean
plane-crazy 2019-12-19 22:09:18 Well Mad is an... what is it, innovation guy
plane-crazy 2019-12-19 22:05:06 oh my god.
plane-crazy 2019-12-19 22:04:53 They said jump off the bridge and you listened
plane-crazy 2019-12-19 22:04:46 you're the dumbass that followed in the other idiot's foot steps

plane-crazy 2019-10-02 06:16:18 time to make the deck
plane-crazy 2019-10-02 06:15:32 but ive never seen a short and WIDE carrier
plane-crazy 2019-10-02 06:15:23 that arent too wide
plane-crazy 2019-10-02 06:15:20 I've seen alot of long carriers
plane-crazy 2019-10-02 06:15:12 my goal is to make it fucking HUGE
plane-crazy 2019-10-02 06:15:03 thats fine
plane-crazy 2019-10-02 06:14:47 fit
plane-crazy 2019-10-02 06:14:46 fucking
plane-crazy 2019-10-02 06:14:45 perfect
plane-crazy 2019-10-02 06:14:34 <@!413465414203342850>
plane-crazy 2019-10-02 06:07:23 now imagine a second section
plane-crazy 2019-10-02 06:07:13 and im at 1,647 blocks
plane-crazy 2019-10-02 06:07:07 just, the deck isnt even made
plane-crazy 2019-10-02 06:06:48 I do want to have a crew compartment
plane-crazy 2019-10-02 06:06:42 im debating having a middle deck
plane-crazy 2019-10-02 05:59:08 it's the start of a short and wide carrier
plane-crazy 2019-10-02 05:58:54 is gonna be 2k+
plane-crazy 2019-10-02 05:58:52 this thing
plane-crazy 2019-10-02 05:57:41 jesus fucking christ
plane-crazy 2019-10-02 05:57:31 
plane-crazy 2019-10-02 05:57:28 
plane-crazy 2019-10-02 05:57:17 1,159 blocks...
plane-crazy 2019-10-02 05:54:49 ?
plane-crazy 2019-10-02 05:49:01 this is gonna be one **CHONK** carrier
plane-crazy 2019-10-02 05:48:54 
plane-crazy 2019-10-02 05:41:59 blubber
plane-crazy 2019-10-02 05:26:52 *"1914 | Sainsbury's Ad | Christmas 2014"*
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 21:18:57 764 blocks
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 21:18:57 
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 21:11:43 lol
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 21:11:42 it might just crash himself
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 21:11:39 if he copies it,
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 21:11:36 i mean think of it this way
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 21:08:28 why
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 21:08:27 oh jesus christ
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 21:00:43 instead of 2
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 21:00:41 ill do 1 fold then
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 20:58:59 its around 49 i think
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 20:58:08 I'll have enough space then
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 20:57:14 but a *W I D E* boi
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 20:57:08 it'll be a short mother fucker
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 20:56:38 and this first section isnt even done
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 20:56:33 im at 400 blocks
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 20:56:19 but the actual section will be 14
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 20:56:10 each "block" is 15 tall,
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 20:55:58 if i can fit 3 folds
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 20:55:48 This is gonna end up being a 3-fold carrier
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 20:55:45 
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 20:55:43 
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 06:12:00 Well actually it’ll be 14 blocks
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 06:11:24 I’m gonna have it fold once or twice, vertically
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 06:10:34 Chonk
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 06:10:32 I’m making a carrier, and it’s gonna be 15 blocks tall
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:52:21 right now it would be 15 tall
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:52:02 If I make a carrier, should i make it taller?
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:51:57 
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:38:54 but i want unguided missiles
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:38:50 I want to make a Katyusha
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:38:16 that dip over time
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:38:12 and unguided HVAR missiles
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:37:59 The most I ask for, is faster missiles and faster guns
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:36:07 At the LEAST, would be ammo types with different velocities
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:33:46 Then have cannons, from 57mm to... 203mm
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:33:32 7.62mm to 30mm
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:33:28 Wing guns, hull guns, both of different calibers
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:33:16 we'd be good
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:33:13 and gave us more weapons
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:33:09 if Rickje did what Simpleplanes did
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:32:51 Just send a burst into his engine and it's gone
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:32:37 HVAP is High Velocity Armor Piercing, perfect for fucking up a jet trying to run away
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:32:17 HVAP, APHE, API-T, HEI-T
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:32:11 Hell at least give us AMMO types
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:32:00 and do like jack shit
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:31:55 terrible velocity
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:31:52 yeah cause they're shit
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:31:27 dude that looks like a weenis
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:31:00 i dont know how to make working torpedoes
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:30:41 i cant make torpedoes
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:29:36 that's still water-based
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:29:31 I might try to make some sort of more futuristic carrier
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:29:17 I cant make helicopters or anything
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:28:55 with any form of VTOL aircraft
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:28:50 i have a absolutely fucking shit time
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:28:45 ehhh
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:26:37 It'll service planes but have missile hatches
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:26:24 mixed with a destroyer/frigate
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:26:17 a carrier
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:26:15 I'm might make
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:25:55 ive been wanting to make more navy stuff
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:25:48 So a navy ship with ballistic missiles
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:25:27 a vehicle using a specific kind of propulsion
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:25:05 an era of plane
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:25:03 a certain type of tank, a certain type of plane
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:24:50 more real ideas, real things
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:23:47 I have Modeler sure, but that's because of an airship I made that, compared to how I am today, is a huge block
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:23:25 im kinda trying to look for more real ideas
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:23:17 eh
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:21:03 I'd like legit ideas that wouldnt be overly hard to make, but isn't some dumb ass idea
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:20:34 No
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:20:03 builds in PC
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:19:50 I'm fresh out of ideas
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 04:19:38 does anyone have any good ideas
plane-crazy 2019-09-29 05:47:07 it's just a feature of Razer Synapse
plane-crazy 2019-09-29 05:46:45 or just put it here
plane-crazy 2019-09-29 05:46:39 want me to dm it to you
plane-crazy 2019-09-29 05:46:03 i think
plane-crazy 2019-09-29 05:45:59 max is 40
plane-crazy 2019-09-29 05:45:14 lemme switch from green
plane-crazy 2019-09-29 05:45:11 speaking of which
plane-crazy 2019-09-29 05:44:37 
plane-crazy 2019-09-29 05:43:41 
plane-crazy 2019-09-29 05:42:54 I have Deathadder Elite
plane-crazy 2019-09-29 05:42:51 mamba, i see
plane-crazy 2019-09-29 05:42:43 Deathadder Elite?
plane-crazy 2019-09-29 05:42:38 what mouse is that?
plane-crazy 2019-09-29 05:41:45 you need macros
plane-crazy 2019-09-29 05:41:42 macros
plane-crazy 2019-09-29 05:41:06 it's called Razer products
plane-crazy 2019-09-29 05:40:41 I had a 40 click/second macro on
plane-crazy 2019-09-29 05:40:34 for the record Sav
plane-crazy 2019-09-29 05:25:21 lol
plane-crazy 2019-09-29 05:24:47 the totally not shit game
plane-crazy 2019-09-29 05:24:42 make it look like oyu're playing raid shadow legends
plane-crazy 2019-09-29 05:16:08 what phone
plane-crazy 2019-09-29 05:16:05 huh
plane-crazy 2019-09-29 05:15:58 phone?
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 19:37:50 and make my car look like a car
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 19:37:44 time to do some drifting
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 04:19:14 I wish Gmod had it
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 04:19:10 yeah
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 04:19:04 if you open a hatch, water will pour in
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 04:18:54 if you make a box and submerge it, no water would be inside it
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 04:18:43 I wish we had proper physics and shit
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 04:18:25 im gonna make a submersible base
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 04:17:54 but idk what
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 04:17:52 i wanna build something
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 03:44:58 
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 03:41:17 
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 03:39:54 
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 02:33:40 since Douchecookie kept insisting
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 02:33:30 but i thought i'd try
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 02:33:22 i mean my car didnt need one, cause it can drift without it
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 02:31:43 im not sure how to make an E-brake
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 02:27:44 shove a friction block against the tire, that's my first test
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 02:27:28 now im just thinking of a way i can make an e-brake in PC
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 02:26:37 okay
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 02:26:36 rear wheels
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 02:26:21 learn how to not be a douche before speaking
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 02:26:08 LeArN cArS bEfOrE sPeAkInG
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 02:25:29 which tires does the E-brake lock? all?
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 02:25:00 and im gonna try to improve it somehow
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 02:24:54 I want to get better at making suspension, so right now im using the style i have
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 02:24:29 i know vip
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 02:24:11 fuck off dude
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 02:23:54 and it wont break if i land hard
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 02:23:43 I wanted actual suspension cause it looks and feels better
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 02:23:25 I didnt say realistic drift car
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 02:23:20 I said drift car,
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 02:22:43 no need
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 02:22:35 I'm not making a legit fucking car with transmission and shit
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 02:22:25 I think Expired is trying to get me to make a legit car
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 02:22:02 it's not double wishbone or anything, but it still works
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 02:21:50 it works
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 02:21:48 also my suspension is good
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 02:21:16 and it's not a complex mess
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 02:21:11 how i have it works way better
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 02:21:06 fuck rack and pinion steering
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 02:20:03 but thanks for reminding me
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 02:19:59 it does drift, without an e-brake
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 02:19:40 <:YouTried:559530066258821131>
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 02:19:33 maybe pay attention before you make comments?
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 02:19:17 my chassis works
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 02:18:01 and im wondering what car i should make out of my chassis
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 02:17:54 brick is wondering why ballast tanks dont work on land
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 02:17:26 please tell me he's being a wise ass
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 02:17:06 brick please tell me you're joking
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 02:14:41 Lancer-Evolution 3
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 02:14:29 I was thinking

plane-crazy 2019-09-28 02:14:04 what car should i turn this into?
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 02:12:31 im gonna make an "ebrake"
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 02:08:39 ouch
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 02:08:37 and the FR tire hit a hill straight on
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 02:08:29 was doing some offroading
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 02:08:25 
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 02:00:26 while I jam out to "King of Eurobeat"
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 02:00:20 I just want something to speed around in
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 01:56:47 ima make a drift car in PC
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 01:55:37 🙃
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 01:55:35 is gone
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 01:55:31 I accidently saved over the car
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 01:55:11 guess what
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 01:55:09 oh hey king
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 22:37:24 beat that oooo man

plane-crazy 2019-09-27 22:36:30 
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 22:34:43 past 30k now
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 22:34:39 
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 20:01:12 it is mentally disabled
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 20:01:09 cause holy shit
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 20:01:05 is that supposed to be a DD?
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 20:00:59 what in the fuck
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 20:00:57 YES
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 20:00:52 1 2 7 3
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 19:57:24 well, good thign i remember how to make the suspension part
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 19:57:14 oof
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 19:57:11 and i didnt realize
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 19:57:07 was accidentally saved over
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 19:57:02 and a working steering rack
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 19:56:57 which had dope suspension
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 19:56:53 the car I made
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 19:56:51 so i just found out
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 19:56:23 cause roblox is gay
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 19:56:15 he was unfriended
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 19:56:08 But when the "best friends" tab in roblox was removed,
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 19:55:12 aka the owner of F.E.A.R
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 19:55:08 I used to be friends with SONICTHEHEDGEHOGXX
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 19:54:50 that's fucking hilarious
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 19:54:46 LOL if that's true,
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 19:54:30 proof or it didnt happen
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 19:54:09 one person
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 19:54:07 rick,
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 19:53:44 and mad doesnt trust A N Y O N E
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 19:53:31 does mad have to do that
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 19:52:14 Did you make it like I did?
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 19:51:54 but i wasnt sure
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 19:51:50 i had a feeling SOMEONE made it
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 19:51:44 huh
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 19:51:37 as in, the whole ball-stepper thing
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 19:51:21 who made it tho
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 19:49:25 what does one get out of exploiting
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 19:47:08 then take a short run back to the "pusher"
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 19:46:52 balls get taken to the top by the steppers
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 19:46:40 ball run complete
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 19:46:37 
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 19:46:33 
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 19:38:44 it's a continuous cycle of balls now
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 19:38:35 I finished my ball run
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 06:17:39 
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 05:57:06 and it repeats
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 05:57:00 they continue it
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 05:56:57 then the balls drop into the next person's plot
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 05:56:50 One person on the end starts it,
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 05:56:43 that would be dope if you ask me
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 05:56:22 What if we had a cross-plot GBC
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 05:56:05 you know what, i just had an idea
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 05:55:37 "stairs" for balls
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 05:55:29 
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 05:55:28 
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 05:38:55 it's fucking GENIUS
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 05:38:51 and to be quite frank
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 05:38:47 I figured out a way to transport the balls up using the stepper idea
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 04:33:37 for a contest
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 04:33:31 did you see my idea in <#544722974574379021>
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 04:33:25 V0xel
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 04:20:51 still something i'd get if i had the space and money
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 04:20:37 lol
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 04:15:53 This ^
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 04:15:51 https://youtu.be/Hwkbj26BQxM
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 04:15:31 and a heavy ass chair
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 04:15:27 a good PC, 3 monitors, included mouse/keyboard, headphones i think even,
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 04:15:14 there's a 10k PC setup
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 03:33:07 That, would be a good contest idea.
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 03:31:50 actually thats a good ass idea, make a "great ball run"
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 03:31:28 that transports the ball to the top
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 03:31:21 im gonna make a ball thing
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 03:30:45 somewhat
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 03:29:49 This is pretty much what im gonna make
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 03:29:44 https://youtu.be/eRPzL8Uo2Rs
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 03:28:12 im trying to make it fully automatic
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 03:23:12 im finna make a stepper one
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 03:21:20 like the lego GBC things
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 03:21:12 actually, genius idea
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 03:21:03 tank tracks?
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 03:20:55 how to make a conveyor
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 03:20:30 then return to the top
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 03:20:26 I want to make have balls leave a container, go through a tube
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 03:20:06 without magnets
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 03:20:03 I can make balls go upward, in a tube
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 03:19:54 I wanna know if there's any way
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 03:15:00 suck ass
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 03:14:58 reset on motors and servo on motor2
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 03:14:52 god
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 03:13:24 it keeps fucking going back and forth
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 03:13:19 when you have it on servo
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 03:13:14 to fucking stab myself between the eyes
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 03:13:02 makes me want
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 03:13:00 motor2
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 02:48:51 if we had balljoints
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 02:31:40 and not have it handed directly to me
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 02:31:36 I want to learn what I did wrong
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 02:31:31 King,
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 02:30:07 Expired is trying to show me
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 02:29:57 i want to learn how to make it
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 02:18:55 <#544722974574379021>
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 02:18:46 in PC
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 02:18:45 is anyone here expert with car suspension
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 02:17:11 but the back make the entire axle more lively
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 02:17:04 front keep the wheels level,
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 02:16:53 which one is better? front or back (top or bottom)?
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 02:07:40 Would this work as suspension
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 02:07:37 
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 02:06:11 connected to a block
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 02:06:08 besides just a single suspension
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 02:06:03 no, it's cause idk how to make suspension
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 02:05:48 turbo is a lazy ass
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 02:05:46 vip cant explain it
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 02:05:39 cause no one knows how to explain the fucking tank suspension to me
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 02:05:24 the tank suspension is FUCKED
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 02:05:19 that shit is fucked
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 02:05:15 not for tank
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 02:05:09 Cause I like suspension
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 02:04:46 and works well
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 02:04:39 which is the easiest to make in PC
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 02:04:34 okay, hol don
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 02:04:10 mech engineer dumbass said my idea was more like christie suspension
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 02:03:40 like i dont even understand what a wishbone is, in terms of suspension
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 02:03:29 i dont know what types of suspension are there
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 02:03:00 that's what "mechanical engineer" dumbass said
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 02:02:51 all that does is fuck it up dude
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 02:02:43 is "single wishbone"
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 02:02:41 i was told that design
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 02:02:16 
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 02:01:41 but is single wishbone, kinda
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 02:01:39 isnt a torsion bar
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 02:01:31 i was told the suspenion was using
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 02:00:14 In terms of how annoying the kid fucking is, he's more annoying than 9TheKing
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 01:59:33 and all it did was make the tires freak the fuck out
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 01:59:24 what his suspension did
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 01:59:18 I literally fucking showed the dumbass
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 01:59:08 more like, mentally disabled engineer
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 01:58:34 then one is like "iM a MeChAnIcAl EnGiNeEr"
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 01:58:11 but all it did was fuck it up even more
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 01:58:05 some dumbasses in my game are saying putting two motors on my suspension would make it better
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 01:24:22 smartass
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 01:24:16 k
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 01:14:48 im being serious

plane-crazy 2019-09-26 03:00:58 literally motors

plane-crazy 2019-09-26 03:00:47 and now vip wont even help me work out how to make this work
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 03:00:35 turbo never helped me finish the torsion bars on my tank

plane-crazy 2019-09-26 02:59:54 and they bring up besiege
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 02:59:30 no motors connected directly to the wheels turning them left and right
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 02:59:20 and have that be the only part that turns the wheels
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 02:59:14 with a steering bar
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 02:59:11 I'm trying to make my car concept steer
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 02:58:59 Vip is fucking useless, more useless than turbo

plane-crazy 2019-09-25 02:13:21 I'm trying to make a helicopter that has engines that can yaw and pitch, but the thing is, motor2 glitches it out.
plane-crazy 2019-09-25 01:33:54 or quadcopter technically
plane-crazy 2019-09-25 01:33:49 rn im making a small dual-rotor helicopter
plane-crazy 2019-09-25 01:33:39 i would assume so
plane-crazy 2019-09-25 01:33:00 and making it a flying tank
plane-crazy 2019-09-25 01:32:55 imagine putting treads on a plane
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 07:07:34 when i block someone i dont tell them

plane-crazy 2019-09-24 06:19:48 You have to deal with it.
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 06:19:44 It's your mess
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 06:19:38 You told me to try Torsion bars
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 06:19:24 **H E L P M E**
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 06:19:17 Vip and I are confused
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 06:19:13 <@!221496030355521536> Help me
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 06:17:52 
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 06:15:51 okay, that's not too big of a change
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 06:15:27 so the suspension goes on a separate motor, on the middle?
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 06:13:23 okay
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 06:12:49 So just to be ENTIRELY SURE, this is how it SHOULD look?
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 06:11:14 this is really fucky
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 06:11:14 okay
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 06:11:14 oh
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 06:10:55 or am i misinterpreting it
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 06:10:46 wait so put another motor on the top block?
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 06:09:38 god that took too god damn long
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 06:09:21 okay
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 06:09:09 like this im guessing
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 06:09:07 oh, so just put it on here...
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 06:07:47 so instead of the suspension on the block, put it directly on the motor?
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 06:06:53 i have no fucking clue
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 06:06:49 cause if not,
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 06:06:45 Vip is this how they connect
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 06:04:14 vip gave up trying to help me cause he doesnt know how to fucking explain where to put the god damn suspension
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:59:22 Turbo, help me
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:59:18 i need help with the treads and i already posted in <#478584971670454284>
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:54:45 the bar thing isnt working, what am i doing wrong
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:52:30 armor and armour
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:47:58 6.1 will run for a while
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:47:46 I'm currently working on 6.1
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:47:42 if this works, then ill consider using it for my later concept versions
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:46:51 okay
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:46:16 now what about the last wheel? cause it's gonna have pistons on it
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:46:06 ok
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:45:56 So these both connect to the chassis?
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:45:21 do the motor and suspension blocks connect
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:45:05 I don't make like, legit tank tracks
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:44:43 
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:44:08 then what, a suspension?
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:44:00 So I have a bar connected to a wheel, and the bar is connected to a motor
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:43:47 ok
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:43:27 theyre all powered
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:43:25 and theyre all drive/road wheels
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:43:17 there's 5 wheels per track
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:43:10 Do remember
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:42:12 i've done folds
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:42:03 was a magnet-powered plane
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:41:57 the most complex thing ive made
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:41:32 how would I get that to work in PC
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:41:23 what the fuck
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:41:10 So basically...
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:39:53 that connects to chassis
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:39:50 Cause my go-to suspension is straight up, just a single suspension on the motors for the wheel
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:39:32 I don't know how to make it
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:39:09 thats what i mean
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:39:06 road wheels
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:37:50 your name dumb
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:37:41 <@!221496030355521536> Do you know a better suspension type for the drive wheels, than mine?
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:34:55 nuts
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:34:54 is going to be
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:34:52 this thing
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:34:35 come look at my tread
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:33:52 ok
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:33:49 what
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:33:33 and the suspension
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:33:30 not including the chassis
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:33:26 1k blocks for BOTH TREADS
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:33:18 holy fuck
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:33:13 for a single tread
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:33:09 504 blocks
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:31:29 or however it's spelt
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:31:26 the Russian Jaeger
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:31:18 it's from Pacific Rim
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:31:13 no
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:30:16 make Cherno Alpha
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:30:12 If you can make that
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:25:17 found a huge ass dinosaur
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:25:15 
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:21:28 except 7-wide
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:21:22 standards tracks for me then
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:20:54 3, 5, or 7
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:20:48 how many wheels should i have
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:20:40 uhhhhh
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:19:41 i do
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:19:31 well
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:18:47 friction blocks
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:18:44 i have an even better idea
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:18:29 this tread design is looking pretty hot
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:14:58 most wide so far was 3
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:14:46 7-wide
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:14:39 this is gonna be my widest tracks
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:14:06 that, is a track design im gonna test
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:13:43 
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:12:04 lemme get a short piece done
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:11:59 hold on
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:11:24 this is a pretty interesting design tbh
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:11:19 oooooo
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:10:30 and make it better
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:10:27 im gonna take the crappy design the 7 guy had
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:09:57 im gonna design some new tracks
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:07:43 is get the event stuff
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:07:39 the MOST damage he could do
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:07:29 and not exploits
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:07:27 cause the game uses creativity and skill
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:07:21 play the game
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:07:18 well exploits dont help him
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:06:10 try to come up with a bunch of track-types
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:05:34 im gonna make a shit ton of tracks/treads
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:05:12 but i make tracks
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:05:09 I don't make tanks,
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:04:09 or 3-long
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:04:02 it would look good if they were 2-long
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:03:36 but those tracks... jesus christ.
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:03:29 the suspension is better than mine,
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:03:24 i doubt the chassis will look any better.
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:03:14 ...
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:03:12 I mean from how he made the tracks
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:03:02 lmao
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:02:30 Or hell, Centurion Mk5 AVRE
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:02:08 Why not a Tiger H1 or Churchill Mk VII
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:01:57 Why the tin can tho
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 05:01:26 why do i feel like he's making a tank because he saw it in World of Tanks
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 04:57:54 and make it "realistic"
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 04:57:49 he wants to put his tracks onto a sherman
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 04:57:38 perfect
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 04:57:37 aaaand he left
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 04:55:46 but mine is really stable
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 04:55:20 Yeah, true
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 04:55:16 
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 04:54:25 since rickje isnt on
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 04:54:23 I mean to be fair it doesnt mean anything anyways
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 04:54:20 
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 04:53:05 I found a ww2-germany copter
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 04:52:54 oop
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 04:52:28 HTTC V5 (7DW)
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 04:52:25 This is my largest design
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 04:52:22 
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 04:51:38 abomination
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 04:51:35 this is a fucking
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 04:51:30 
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 04:50:59 
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 04:50:27 look at chat too
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 04:50:27 
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 04:50:05 He's thirsty to take my design lol
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 04:49:53 He unblacklists me
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 04:49:49 then as SOON AS I grab MY tracks out
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 04:49:37 and he blacklists and copy-blacklists me
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 04:49:27 so i go over to see what his concept is
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 04:49:22 I join a server and see this guy making tank treads
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 01:54:31 since its not powered by a jet engine
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 01:54:25 or, technically not jet
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 01:54:21 My new PVP jet
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 01:54:19 
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 01:12:15 up
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 01:12:13 goes straight uo
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 01:11:59 im gonna make a magnet MISSILE
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 01:11:39 but unable to manuever
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 01:11:33 1,700 sps level
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 01:11:03 15 now
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 01:10:33 im adding more magnets
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 01:10:30 uberpowered
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 01:10:28 I'm gonna make this thing
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 01:09:56 just 5 magnets at the back
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 01:09:46 158 parts
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 01:09:33 
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 01:09:32 This is mine.
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 01:08:49 Magnet planes is my new engine for fighters
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 01:08:29 doesnt say i cant use magnets
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 01:08:18 *"Build a 600 block plane powered by a single propeller engine (any size) without helium capable of going 400sps in level flight."*
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 01:08:00 it doesnt say i cant use magnets
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 01:07:26 with the magnet engines
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 01:07:21 almost tempted to go for "Crazy Engineer"
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 01:01:37 I made a magnet powered plane
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 01:01:35 
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 19:57:38 and look at the tracks
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 19:57:36 google mk 5 tank
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 19:57:32 yeah
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 19:56:26 that's what it looks like
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 19:56:20 with hinges on both sides
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 19:56:16 it's pretty much a plate
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 19:34:09 that opening would be perfect for like, a tiny plane
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 19:29:26 and V5 is going to be 7 wheels
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 19:29:21 V3 is 3 wheels, V4 is 2 wheels
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 19:29:12 V2 is motor treads, 5-wheels
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 19:28:58 HTTC V1 is my first rope treads design, with 5 wheels
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 19:28:44 that are possible
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 19:28:41 Basically I'm trying to make the largest and smallest possible tank treads
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 19:28:28 HTTC is "Hercules Tank Tread Concept"
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 19:28:08 It's the HTTC V5.
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 19:26:42 
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 19:12:34 Add more suspension
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 19:12:30 This is my current idea
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 19:12:28 
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 19:10:34 working tracks with this too
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 19:10:31 the thing is im making tracks
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 19:09:53 and it connects to the chassis
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 19:09:44 Cause right now I have suspension for each wheel, a single suspension-block
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 19:09:30 Well, just in general better suspension
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 19:07:58 lol
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 19:04:14 I use a single suspension, but I feel like there's a better way
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 19:03:56 Does anyone know a better way to make individual wheel suspension for tanks?
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 06:43:02 Youdprobsbly have to make gears
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 06:42:53 Cause I mean
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 06:40:57 Like a drive shaft
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 06:40:52 I wonder if anyone has ever made a mechanism that controls everything else
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 06:39:16 But the balls go through a course and come back
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 06:39:09 I’m making a Rube Goldberg kinda thing
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 06:16:56 Idk what to make
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 01:49:59 Lol
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 01:48:48 *”I am very fuck angry”*
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 01:45:27 *Definitely a serial killer in the making*
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 01:45:10 *airjetsuit sounds like a serial killer in the making.*
plane-crazy 2019-08-04 18:45:37 What
plane-crazy 2019-06-21 06:28:41 and it's my largest build of all
plane-crazy 2019-06-21 06:28:33 with detail
plane-crazy 2019-06-21 06:28:17 This is the first full on proper tank ive made
plane-crazy 2019-06-21 06:27:57 for reference
plane-crazy 2019-06-21 06:27:43 
plane-crazy 2019-06-21 06:27:36 I made a huge fat boi

plane-crazy 2019-05-05 21:29:06 Where to report people for inappropriate builds
plane-crazy 2019-04-27 17:59:25 Little Brother
plane-crazy 2019-04-27 17:59:19 Big Brother
plane-crazy 2019-04-27 05:49:44 either 4 with more explosives, or 8 with more chances
plane-crazy 2019-04-27 05:49:22 or do the same 1 rack per wing, but 4 torpedoes per wing
plane-crazy 2019-04-27 05:49:13 im debating if i wanna do 1 rack per wing, holding 2 torpedoes per rack
plane-crazy 2019-04-27 05:48:56 im making racks for torpedoes
plane-crazy 2019-04-27 05:43:12 god damn people
plane-crazy 2019-04-27 05:43:09 im being serious
plane-crazy 2019-04-27 05:43:06 no.
plane-crazy 2019-04-27 05:42:40 so what do i name it
plane-crazy 2019-04-27 05:42:26 it's meant to be a post-war Alternate universe German torpedo jet bomber
plane-crazy 2019-04-27 05:42:02 I have no clue, quite frankly
plane-crazy 2019-04-27 05:41:50 What should I name this
plane-crazy 2019-04-27 05:41:50 
plane-crazy 2019-04-27 05:41:49 
plane-crazy 2019-04-27 05:41:49 
plane-crazy 2019-04-27 05:29:14 that is also a flying boat
plane-crazy 2019-04-27 05:29:10 I'm fixing my float plane, and im gonna make the lore of it, as being a Post-war, AU German jet torpedo bomber
