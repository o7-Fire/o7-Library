creations-chat 2022-01-24 03:30:31 I tried to make it smaller so I can have one on both ends and have enough room for the snow plow things

[Wedge Signs]

[Building]

A 1x1 or 1x2 wedge that has the functionality of a sign and displays text on the sloped edge. Great for number boards on locomotives and other things. (Probably not getting accepted but I tried ðŸ™‚)
creations-chat 2022-01-24 05:27:21 Built from visual reference and my excruciating attention to detail
creations-chat 2022-01-24 15:28:08 Tried to make handrails
creations-chat 2022-01-24 15:31:48 Thing's painted grey so I can see parts easier, handrails a colored black to see them. Though, I did do the handrails incorrectly
creations-chat 2022-01-24 15:55:19 Livery test
help 2022-01-24 16:07:32 How do I mash two wedges into the same block space?
creations-chat 2022-01-24 17:31:20 Finished the cab
creations-chat 2022-01-24 17:33:26 The cab of a GE AC4400CW
creations-chat 2022-01-24 17:37:20 That yellow stripes for a different livery and rail company. And I couldn't figure out some of the stuff
creations-chat 2022-01-24 17:41:41 Is this better?
creations-chat 2022-01-24 17:43:45 What's wrong with it now?
creations-chat 2022-01-24 17:45:51 how?
creations-chat 2022-01-24 17:49:29 I started playing two years ago...
creations-chat 2022-01-24 17:59:27 What is angle locking? I've literally never heard of it
creations-chat 2022-01-24 18:06:05 As I've already said, the reason the colors are different is because it's a different railroad company
creations-chat 2022-01-24 18:37:59 Tried to improve the loco's front (Ignore the wing lights, those are temporary at the moment)
creations-chat 2022-01-24 18:41:02 This is the livery I'm trying to do. (Yes, I know there's hazard stripes on the plow thing.)
creations-chat 2022-01-24 18:44:06 Okay.
Also, nose lights
creations-chat 2022-01-24 18:48:57 Who's this for?
creations-chat 2022-01-24 18:51:04 Can't. I'm using stock train wheels and if I put more space between them the trucks won't be able to handle the curves.
Detailing I might be able to squeeze in without them having a stroke
creations-chat 2022-01-24 19:05:36 Took the yellow from my Stuka and put it on the loco (The yellow going onto the trapdoor)
creations-chat 2022-01-24 19:12:31 Don't ask, I don't know how I did this either

creations-chat 2022-01-24 19:41:33 Wrong loco. It's supposed to be a GE AC4400CW, but some parts of it are being problematic
creations-chat 2022-01-24 20:00:35 
creations-chat 2022-01-24 20:02:48 What? I don't understand

creations-chat 2022-01-24 20:28:50 You guys want this to be a tutorial?
creations-chat 2022-01-24 21:01:04 How many blocks back should the top yellow go? (Currently four blocks)

creations-chat 2022-01-24 21:14:08 The colors should be correct at this point
creations-chat 2022-01-24 21:16:30 Of course. I forgot I could do that.
creations-chat 2022-01-24 21:24:58 Now it looks like this
creations-chat 2022-01-24 21:27:43 Anyways now that I've changed the material, how many blocks back should that orange-yellow color go?
creations-chat 2022-01-24 21:48:12 The rest of the body's forming now
creations-chat 2022-01-24 22:02:21 Main body is finished.
Now to add finer details such as handrails, lights, horns, etc.
creations-chat 2022-01-24 22:29:56 Doing some retexturing and adding parts I didn't see before
creations-chat 2022-01-24 23:25:35 Another W.I.P.
bug-reports 2022-01-25 00:48:10 I don't know how I managed to do this...
creations-chat 2022-01-25 00:49:48 Got the handrails on the right-hand side

bot-central 2022-02-27 03:08:28 &suggest "Quarter Block"

[Building]

In essence, the Quarter Block would be a standard Half Block with a minor change. It would be cut in half down the middle so that one side/ corner of the block space contains the actual block.

Basically Half Wedge from the Half Block category, but not wedge and rather a block.

bot-central 2022-08-19 16:15:08 &suggest [More Cylinder Sizes]

[Building]

Basically more cylinder sizes for players going for larger cylindrical builds. 
For example: like a 7x7 cylinder, or a 9x9.
bot-central 2022-08-19 17:17:08 Can't. Nothing will make a shape like it
bot-central 2022-08-19 17:20:54 Not exactly gonna work like that
bot-central 2022-08-19 17:22:50 If this is gonna turn into rant just to shit on whitenames I'm going to go away
