The Tale of VerbalLinks (358126557275095053)
help 2019-09-30 20:30:13 Hello ladies and gentlemen.  I was gonna build a ship, but I seemed to have hit a wall.  Note this is my first time building a large scale ship, and I don't know how other people get theirs to be bigger.  Thanks for any help.
creations-chat 2019-10-07 02:24:47 IJN Kongo.  Only focusing on the body of the ship as of now so ignore the missing guns.
creations-chat 2019-10-07 02:28:57 Yeah I'm working on that except the balance on ballasts and helium is weird.
creations-chat 2019-10-07 02:30:40 Don't know what that means so that will be a no.
creations-chat 2019-10-07 02:33:50 I'll see what I can do.  Thanks for the tip.
help 2019-10-07 02:58:18 Something like this?
creations-chat 2019-10-07 06:15:08 So this should be the final version of the Kongo that won't include the guns (for now).  Otherwise, I've fixed that waterline issue and made it faster.

creations-chat 2019-10-07 06:15:20 
creations-chat 2019-10-07 06:15:42 Alright last picture and I'm done.
help 2019-10-10 01:00:56 Does this look okay for something that's been crammed into a small space for proportional reasons that the Kongo wasn't really that big in the first place?
help 2019-10-10 01:08:34 Something like this?
help 2019-10-10 01:13:38 Like this?
help 2019-10-10 01:15:21 Alright, thanks man.
creations-chat 2019-10-10 05:36:23 It's Kongo, but with main battery guns.  Nothing much other to say than that.

help 2019-10-11 09:09:57 Anyone know a fold that can work with this?
help 2019-10-11 10:35:24 I'll just make a temporary fold until I can find out how to make one that works.
creations-chat 2019-10-12 09:16:55 Was I supposed to make this? Nope.  Is it laggy? Definitely.  Is my computer burning? Very likely.
Yeah, it's my take on the HMS Hood.
creations-chat 2019-10-12 09:18:02 Block count as always because that's very fun.
creations-chat 2019-10-14 01:03:18 It's probably an Iowa class or something very similar.
help 2019-10-14 01:15:17 It's alright if I use an alt account to have more save data if I don't want to remove stuff on my main account, right?
help 2019-10-14 01:25:19 Okay just making sure.  I'm trying to make another ship that's bigger so more detail can be put on it (which I feel like is the problem with my designs).  I'm wondering what fold will work with this (and provide enough space for any structures) since the only one I'm thinking of will leave ugly beams on the sides.
help 2019-10-14 01:42:44 Should I wait and build some structures and possibly hide the fold in that?
help 2019-10-14 20:26:21 I've had a few minor cases when the motor kinda wiggles as well.  What I usually do is deactivate the motor once the section of the ship is in.  Otherwise I have no real answers if you want to keep it on.
help 2019-10-25 11:31:39 Maybe something like this?
help 2019-10-25 11:39:20 Here is a better example than just some red lines.  Hope this helps!
creations-chat 2019-10-26 01:38:29 Heard bigger was better.  So, I did a test with my limits and here is the result.  It's technically custom, although highly based off the South Dakota (1939).  Tips on how to improve are highly appreciated.
creations-chat 2019-10-26 01:49:05 Sided wedges?
creations-chat 2019-10-26 01:57:47 Agreed, I'll just scrap it.
creations-chat 2019-10-26 02:22:33 Bridge is behind the second turret.  Doesn't really matter though because I've scrapped it.
help 2019-10-27 02:45:39 Does this look alright for the front section of the USS Arizona? I want to get this creation closest to perfection as possible.
creations-chat 2019-10-27 08:05:58 At least add objects on the deck so it's not so bland.  Maybe those food/liquid barrels ( I don't know what they're for ), and cannons.
creations-chat 2019-10-27 08:08:01 Not that short though.
creations-chat 2019-10-27 08:18:16 Yes, nice shadow looks very real.
help 2019-10-27 08:35:33 Had this problem a few times.  What I'd do is probably add more wing panels/control surfaces or try center the gravity to the blue point.  Those actions usually make it more stable but I can't confirm because I'm not 100% a plane person.
help 2019-10-27 08:47:15 Yeah, you just gotta experiment and see what works.
help 2019-10-29 06:53:32 Does the size of the Arizona seem accurate? Is it too short or too long? I'll ask about the motors later.
help 2019-10-29 07:08:44 Should I enlarge the back section or middle?
help 2019-10-29 07:09:08 Alright, I'll see what I can do.
help 2019-10-30 19:48:57 1 block gap?
help 2019-10-30 23:32:21 The only easy way I see is to shorten the striped section.  That's pretty much the only way I see without redoing the entire ship.
help 2019-10-30 23:34:12 I just say that because the striped section looks a little big when compared.  Course I never made any ship that big so I wish you luck.
creations-chat 2019-11-01 20:18:25 Landing gear kinda ruins it.  No offense but it really does.
creations-chat 2019-11-02 10:40:08 Back looks a little too pointy, but it's pretty good other than that.  Nice job. üëè
creations-chat 2019-11-02 10:42:03 Perfect.  I'll look forward to it.
creations-chat 2019-11-02 12:27:34 No.  It's just the landing gear.
creations-chat 2019-11-02 12:30:01 Also no, I've seen much worse.

help 2019-11-03 08:14:55 Looks about right.  Though what I would probably do is like go to an editing software and put both of the images in.  Make their transparency about 50 so you can see through both of them and kinda eyeball the proportions.
help 2019-11-03 11:45:45 Practically finished with my ship.  Just wondering if there is a way to hide that one motor.
help 2019-11-03 11:48:53 Well that's unfortunate.  Guess we'll just ignore it.
help 2019-11-03 11:50:15 I'll just take the pictures from a different angle so it either isn't in the shot or blends with the metal on the ship.

creations-chat 2019-11-04 05:56:05 Well...  It is quite lost into the chat history of creations.  Doubted anyone would've seen it past at least 12 hours since the post.
creations-chat 2019-11-05 17:14:01 The amount of smoke pipes makes it look like the engine just failed or something.
help 2019-11-06 05:38:26 You guys wouldn't happen to know a way to make this shape, would you? I've tried wedges but it felt a little too thick and triangle wedges give too much empty space.
help 2019-11-06 05:40:23 I've only slightly managed to make the top part of it.  I'm trying to make the USS Chester (CL-1) that is sized like it is in real life and with the character in Roblox.
help 2019-11-06 05:46:43 Should I use triangle wedges or normal wedges?
help 2019-11-06 05:53:32 Like this?
help 2019-11-06 06:01:48 Alright.  I'll build the front section and check in later on.  Thanks for the help!
help 2019-11-06 10:38:46 Oh yeah...  I've been using your St. Louis for a bit of inspiration since the Chester is somewhat similar.  Thanks for the reference!

help 2019-11-13 03:27:48 I'd recommend using the other wedges.  Like [ 3x1 wedge, then 2x1 wedge, and then 1x1 wedge ] and repeat.
help 2019-11-13 06:43:09 That might just be the amount of other creations on your server.  Although I can't exactly tell myself as I don't have a great computer in the first place.
help 2019-11-13 06:59:31 Is it laggy all together or just playing your creation?
creations-chat 2019-11-13 09:08:39 Few minor improvements to the Arizona.  I made the back tower taller and replaced cylinders with whatever they're supposed to be.
creations-chat 2019-11-13 09:10:17 Back view.
creations-chat 2019-11-13 09:13:39 Block count just in case or if you want to know.
creations-chat 2019-11-13 09:20:53 I will take constructive criticism to improve the ship, but I probably won't repost unless it's an entire revamp or something big.
creations-chat 2019-11-15 02:41:36 Why is the Hood missing a turret?
help 2019-11-15 04:44:22 When you run the creation?
creations-chat 2019-11-15 08:59:09 Yes.  Race tracks are overrated.
help 2019-11-16 23:20:03 Depends on what battleship it is.  I made the Arizona 21 blocks wide at the widest point (Extra information, it's about 140 blocks long, limited by the front tower that's in the way in the fold. )
help 2019-11-18 20:31:12 Top part going down seems a little zig zaggy.
help 2019-11-18 20:36:23 Don't mean to gloss over your thing but does this look alright? It's supposed to be the Type XXI Submarine, U-2540.  Note: I can't add those twin 30mm cannons because the sub is too small to add those kind of details.  Despite that, this ship is to scale.
help 2019-11-18 20:56:48 How should I add said detail?
help 2019-11-18 21:02:02 The turret design I thought of doesn't look great to the real one.  And I have to stuff it in this small area.
help 2019-11-18 21:02:12 To this
help 2019-11-19 03:02:15 This good?
help 2019-11-23 22:21:20 Which one looks better?
help 2019-11-27 05:25:41 How should I build this front part of the hull? Normal wedges or triangle wedges?
creations-chat 2019-11-28 07:39:16 Looks like some Yamato-Montana crossover.
creations-chat 2019-11-28 07:53:50 Add more to the superstructure as well.  It's kinda bland and really only consists of one bridge and one boiler.  Include more things like towers and possibly visible secondary turrets.  Maybe as well, lower the ship.  It looks like it's about to tip over.
creations-chat 2019-11-28 07:54:33 Oh my bad.  Just think of it as elaboration.
creations-chat 2019-11-28 07:57:07 Pretty sure the citadel is usually referred to as the vital parts of the ship.
creations-chat 2019-12-01 11:39:43 Still...  It's just too long.  Even for a battlecruiser.
help 2019-12-03 01:36:45 You can send an image to yourself or an empty group chat.  When you press the image and click "Open original", it'll send you to your browser with the image's link.  Just copy from there.
help 2019-12-03 03:56:32 Is this reportable?
help 2019-12-03 03:59:46 Ah, unfortunate.  I might just switch servers.  Thanks for verifying.
creations-chat 2019-12-05 23:36:02 Squished plane.
help 2019-12-07 00:24:55 Well someone just did a Star Destroyer not too long ago.  Maybe the Battlecruiser for originality.
help 2019-12-10 03:19:45 Can I request Designer [IV] and Shipwright [V] for this?
help 2019-12-12 02:11:38 Anyone have any ideas on how to build a mast like this instead of accidentally making the biggest boiler in history?
help 2019-12-15 13:56:50 Is it possible to make a cage/lattice mast within this space (7x7)?
help 2019-12-15 23:14:22 <:Upvote:490311647492309004>  Pretty good.
help 2019-12-18 04:56:57 Are the guns controlled by motor 2?
help 2019-12-18 05:17:42 Look through the motor 2s and turn down their torque.
help 2019-12-18 05:17:56 Or whatever it was called that wasn't speed.
help 2019-12-18 05:18:38 It's 100 at default.  You can safely turn it down to about 20-30.
help 2019-12-18 05:19:23 It shouldn't affect much.  You'll still be able to do everything it's supposed to do.
creations-chat 2019-12-18 06:37:07 What are you modeling off of?
creations-chat 2019-12-18 06:38:10 Yeah that doesn't usually work out too well...
creations-chat 2019-12-18 06:38:29 First ship I modeled off of nothing got downvoted.
creations-chat 2019-12-18 06:38:38 It's good to have a reference.
creations-chat 2019-12-18 06:38:59 I'll DM you a little more on your ship situation.
help 2019-12-18 08:05:20 Use half blocks and/or replace blocks with half blocks when possible.
help 2019-12-18 08:13:22 Wedges can help too with flat surfaces or anywhere that you don't see the "wedge" part of it.
help 2019-12-18 09:37:51 Most of those kinda already exist.
help 2019-12-18 09:38:26 Or maybe increase the scale so you can add more detail.
help 2019-12-18 18:59:06 My best guess on how to fix it is to lower the torque.  Though that might not 100% fix the problem.
help 2019-12-18 19:06:50 Do you have a reference image?
help 2019-12-18 19:07:47 Oh I see.
help 2019-12-18 19:08:53 In the case with this reference.  Maybe you can extend the bow a little further.  Try find a side picture of that vessel and then you can just roughly eyeball the bow and everything else.
help 2019-12-18 19:09:08 Other than that.  Good shapes and good luck.
help 2019-12-18 19:09:53 Oh well.  You can keep going then.  Looks pretty decent for just the front.
help 2019-12-18 19:12:06 I'm pretty sure some do.
help 2019-12-18 19:12:40 I mean, most I've seen just look like smaller Arleigh Burkes.
creations-chat 2020-01-08 23:58:36 Nice shape, but that tower looks too high and slightly stretched.
help 2020-01-11 05:06:54 51 blocks.
help 2020-01-11 05:07:37 Should be, assuming it's a square.  I've only measured the sides.
creations-chat 2020-01-13 19:48:48 Not bad.  Could do a little more work with the paint, but I'm not downvoting.
help 2020-01-18 12:19:17 Looks about a 4 more than a 3.
creations-chat 2020-01-18 12:24:16 Looks like a destroyer.
help 2020-01-18 12:31:44 Oh right.  Bit of a habit to add two.  Don't know why.

help 2020-01-22 21:42:15 Although I'm not very good with cannons like that.  I can suggest that you have some motors that extend and contract when the cannon rotates up or down.  At the end of the motors, you can have some sort of transparent red circle that will indicate where the shot will land.  Assuming you have Motor2 though, it won't really work (and if you're using for PVP.  It'll destroy the circle anyway). 
 Safe bet just predict like everyone else is saying until you or someone else finds that out or somethin'.  Best of luck.
