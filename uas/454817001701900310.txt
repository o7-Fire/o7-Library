creations-chat 2020-10-18 22:32:05 that was the first time i made it, it couldn't handle 130 bombs so i dropped it down to like 48 😔
creations-chat 2020-10-18 22:36:22 i take that back there's 54 bombs, i have 3 rounds of bombs before i run out. So i drop 16 bombs per batch i think
creations-chat 2020-10-18 22:37:51 I take that back again theres 48

creations-chat 2020-12-12 18:59:04 <@!456956041922478081>  sorry for the ping but i saw your stuka just now, and i was wondering how you did that single pyramid thingy. like how did you manage to get a prop in a single block that isn;t even meant to do that, i would be more than helpful if you showed me
the-dump 2020-12-15 14:20:59 
creations-chat 2021-01-11 12:35:30 it doesn't say the version but here's the blue print if you can tell which ah 1 is which https://www.the-blueprints.com/blueprints-depot-restricted/helicopters/bell/bell_ah_1_cobra-05331.jpg
creations-chat 2021-01-14 01:56:20 thats the whole purpose of the build, to look used
creations-chat 2021-01-14 01:59:23 metal is pretty much just makes the whole build easier and the main purpose of the build is to be fats and agile, also metal is pretty much just the default material with extra weight and with some slight changes, and it's darker
creations-chat 2021-01-14 02:09:13 then why does my heli not fly at all when i used metal material, i litterally have evidence that metal affects the weight
creations-chat 2021-01-14 02:15:04 https://streamable.com/8equ3x my turns were slower than usual and it felt heavier over all, still could fly so thats a plus. but like i said, it was just a darker version of the default block.
creations-chat 2021-01-14 02:19:41 https://streamable.com/32mypj here it is without the metal, you can tell by it being more brigh tstill the same speed, but it felt lighter in the controls. The only reason why i was falling is because i was testing the turn rate
creations-chat 2021-01-14 02:21:43 but like you said, maybe it could be because of the reflections. But i get your point'

creations-chat 2021-01-23 17:03:25 i'm making a custom plane, can someone give me some feedback?
creations-chat 2021-01-23 17:05:36 i told you that it's not finnished yet, and also the reason why it's not further back is because if i do then then the plane tilts towards the front, but i am going to move the landing gear back a bit once i finnish it
creations-chat 2021-01-23 17:16:14 quick question, which wing type should i use? Because the current one i'm working with isn't that good
creations-chat 2021-01-23 18:28:03 yeah maybe i should add actual thrust so it can fly (maybe though just maybe)
creations-chat 2021-01-23 18:58:13 Oh wait maybe I should add a rudder with elevators, those would look good
creations-chat 2021-01-24 00:06:01 nose it too long, cockpit is too small, and learn how to use single rotor, it's pretty easy. Also your rudder is kind off.. thick, and so are the wings <@!485279335758954497>
creations-chat 2021-03-07 19:55:24 i need feedback, it looks bland
creations-chat 2021-03-07 21:04:37 it's because of the muzzle and also it has cargo for extra detail but it ended up loking less like the kv1
creations-chat 2021-03-25 22:39:54 <@!719168864705052802>  why upvote when you can downvote
