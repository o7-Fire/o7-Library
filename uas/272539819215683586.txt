help 2022-08-30 19:41:40 What does 'Ignore Others' on the Hover Thruster settings list do?
help 2022-08-30 19:45:55 There are 161 others and they are all inside of each other
help 2022-08-30 19:46:24 When I enable that setting it doesn't seem to do anything so I'm just wondering what it actually does
help 2022-08-30 19:48:11 Did I do something wrong I can't paste an image into creations chat
help 2022-08-30 19:50:02 How do I get that?
help 2022-08-30 19:50:44 I don't know how to lvl up
help 2022-08-30 19:51:29 Can I talk anywhere?

help 2022-08-30 21:03:44 It's just a bug in the game
help 2022-08-30 21:04:05 I fixed it by unequipping and equipping the jet pack
help 2022-08-30 21:04:18 If that still doesn't work, rejoin

help 2022-08-30 21:05:40 For me it always works, that's something I can't help with
help 2022-08-30 21:41:40 too much motor lock
help 2022-08-30 22:11:32 The front connector is too big
help 2022-08-30 22:12:28 Put turning fans on top of it
help 2022-08-30 22:12:36 And use 1 motor lock to make it only show half
help 2022-08-30 22:12:56 You can probably use Water Prop 2
help 2022-08-30 22:13:07 I don't have level 3 so I can't show you
bot-central 2022-08-30 22:13:37 !rank
help 2022-08-30 22:14:08 Place a Water Prop 2 and right under it have a motor lock facing upwards
help 2022-08-30 22:16:01 Attention to detail
help 2022-08-30 22:17:38 I was recommending adding turning fans on top by using water propeller 2
help 2022-08-30 22:17:57 I know that there isn't a turning fan in the game but you can make custom ones
help 2022-08-30 22:54:41 a turning fan is a turning fan
help 2022-08-30 22:55:40 that's basically what it is
help 2022-08-30 22:55:45 a fan that turns
help 2022-08-30 22:55:58 :/
help 2022-08-30 22:56:21 A hollow cylinder with turning blades
help 2022-08-30 22:57:15 It doesn't burn fuel
help 2022-08-30 22:57:28 its a fan
help 2022-08-30 22:58:27 Are you a homo sapien?

creations-chat 2022-08-30 23:24:18 On my channel
creations-chat 2022-08-30 23:31:29 I'm getting bombarded with downvotes
creations-chat 2022-08-30 23:33:32 I have been working on it for half a year.. :/ fine though
creations-chat 2022-08-30 23:36:23 this community has no mercy for piston engine builders like me.. and yes, I started like last winter
creations-chat 2022-08-30 23:38:38 It probably got 12 downvotes because its not a 2000 block absolute monstrosity that takes up the entire plot and looks like a drivable box while at the same time killing others fps and having same features
creations-chat 2022-08-31 00:01:48 I appreciate the help but you didn't tell me how to make a build get upvotes
creations-chat 2022-08-31 00:05:12 Maybe if I add a vehicle body on top it will get better votes
creations-chat 2022-08-31 00:07:47 lol, its totally possible, trust me, I also have some friends that can help me
creations-chat 2022-08-31 00:09:48 I know that the interior will be impossible, but if I made a truck or something with a bed cover to hide the rear suspension, I can
creations-chat 2022-08-31 00:12:53 well, since I can't put a vehicle body on it, getting better votes will be impossible. whatever, at least its fun to drive.. lol
creations-chat 2022-08-31 00:15:19 I'm not going to build things I don't like just to get votes that don't do anything in the end.. so I'm just going to not care about it. not a big deal
creations-chat 2022-08-31 00:17:36 what is that??
creations-chat 2022-08-31 00:21:54 someone: downvotes  everyone else: SHAME! SHAME SHAME!
help 2022-09-02 01:05:52 How do I make text blocks fully invisible?
help 2022-09-02 02:39:08 It's not invisible and you cant set size to 0
help 2022-09-02 02:40:40 I've seen mobile players do it
help 2022-09-02 02:48:10 My build doesn't have something behind it so I just have to deal with it :/
help 2022-09-02 02:51:00 I'm not going to apply it. I was just wondering out of curiosity how mobile users actually make it fully invisible
help 2022-09-02 02:51:50 I'm pretty sure its another key on the mobile keyboard
help 2022-09-02 02:52:06 I'm just guessing
help 2022-09-02 02:52:12 I don't play mobile anyways
help 2022-09-02 02:53:01 Okay, It's over. I was just wondering how to make it FULLY invisible not to start an argument
help 2022-09-02 18:12:45 The reason that its wobbling is because the top portion of the build that's supported by the motor2's is too heavy. To fix it, either reduce the motor2 speed or make it lighter
creations-chat 2022-09-03 23:16:08 I got a speed so high it doesn't register on the speedometer
creations-chat 2022-09-03 23:18:11 The speedometer disappears
creations-chat 2022-09-03 23:21:23 I got it by making a catapult
creations-chat 2022-09-09 21:22:14 You're probably right
creations-chat 2022-09-11 00:09:02 You have to get to lvl 3 by talking to send images
creations-chat 2022-09-30 22:47:19 Based on his opinion
creations-chat 2022-09-30 22:49:26 Probably biased, just a guess though
help 2022-10-01 00:50:54 I'm having issues tuning my suspension, the rear rebound is too quick and whenever I do a jump it nose dives. I tried increasing the rear piston force but now it's too stiff.
help 2022-10-01 00:55:05 It's not shaders, it's just a filter, also it's cropped. a friend helped edit it because I was going to put it in creations (adding body soon)
help 2022-10-01 00:56:04 I'm not exactly the best at tuning suspension lol, tuning is difficult sometimes
help 2022-10-01 00:56:52 you know the jumps by the rails? when I go over those sometimes it will literally do a front flip
help 2022-10-01 00:59:56 I wish I could send a video but I dont know how
help 2022-10-01 01:00:58 When I hit the rails at 180sps or so it literally does a 5ft jump
help 2022-10-01 01:01:42 Any recommendations?
help 2022-10-01 01:02:40 I've already tried increasing the wheelbase, adding more ballast, everything I could think of
help 2022-10-01 01:03:29 It weighs down the suspension basically
help 2022-10-01 01:03:41 And makes the suspension more responsive
help 2022-10-01 01:04:48 shaders are real-time filters, in a way
help 2022-10-01 01:05:09 a filter is just coloring udjustments, brightness, etc.
help 2022-10-01 01:05:31 also shaders can adjust the lighting in real time
help 2022-10-01 01:07:28 I might be wrong idk don't really care
help 2022-10-01 02:12:37 <@527653676022628353> I just fixed the issue now. should start working fine on rails
help 2022-10-11 21:31:20 How do I make a turning motor lock tower (balanced)
