The Tale of Kaiosei (450236369147789313)
help 2018-12-31 01:31:31 So some guy let me copy his plane squadron. When his planes
fly, they are all in sync.
However when I try to fly, they just stay on the ground and refuse
to fly even when all the planes are exactly the same.
Is there a problem here that I can fix?
help 2018-12-31 01:32:58 I tried placing the pilot seat in different planes, but still the same results.
help 2018-12-31 01:33:10 Did your squadron eventually work or-?
help 2018-12-31 01:34:26 Yep
help 2018-12-31 01:34:34 They just face downwards
help 2018-12-31 01:34:50 Yeah
help 2018-12-31 01:35:29 Oh I see.
help 2018-12-31 01:35:51 If I do that it doesn't really matter where my centre of mass is?
help 2018-12-31 01:36:00 because right now it's off by alot
help 2018-12-31 01:36:44 Thanks!

help 2019-12-28 13:26:08 How do people make their VTOLs or drones take off vertically so perfectly? All of my test drones always veer off course even though the centre of gravity is exactly in the middle of the aircraft. Is there some method of avoiding this?

help 2019-12-28 13:27:10 Really? On my screen it shows the COG as in the direct centre of my aircraft tho
help 2019-12-28 13:28:54 It is set to default.
help 2019-12-28 13:29:32 Just a test drone because I'm testing it for a bigger craft that's WIP
help 2019-12-28 13:30:00 All the thrusters are like equally distributed so I don't know why it would veer off course.
help 2019-12-28 13:30:44 Ignore the hole, that was recent
help 2019-12-28 13:31:49 Sure.
help 2019-12-28 13:32:11 Thanks.
