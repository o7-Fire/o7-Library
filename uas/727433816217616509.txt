the-dump 2021-07-08 21:34:09 Sounds like most roblox games
the-dump 2021-07-08 21:35:29 Sounds fun
the-dump 2021-07-08 21:36:12 That was irony

help 2021-07-08 23:47:41 That ship is quite long and tall compared to its width, maybe you should try widening the hull or filling the underwater part with solid blocks so the center of mass will be lower but buoyancy the same
help 2021-07-08 23:50:20 Maybe with motor 2 set to servo?

help 2022-09-13 20:58:39 <@628043186379685889> you did some wrong math in your suggestion, the speed of sound in sps is 1225, not 800 or 900, each stud is 28cm and the speed of sound is 343m/s, so 343/0,28 is 1225

creations-chat 2023-04-16 09:51:53 <@981570974568837160> for your Titanic, here are the innacuracies: the forecastle is the wrong color, the masts are the wrong color, the funnels are the wrong color, the poop deck is the wrong color, the bridge is incorrect, central bridge support is missing, lifeboat layout is incorrect, funnels arent always venting steam and the steam is vented from both sides of the funnel not just front, the 4th funnel should have a small amount of smoke coming out of it, the crows nest color is wrong, you could have put the railings sideways so it actually looks like railing, these are all the simple changes to the design that are quite easy to incorporate

creations-chat 2023-06-02 19:24:56 Same in eastern europe, where you can get sometimes less than 2 euro an hour
creations-chat 2023-06-26 04:53:47 Titanics foward superstructure
creations-chat 2023-06-26 19:12:12 There are ways to do it, but as Titanic 1:1 would be around 384 blocks, you would need 8 accounts for it if you decide to not motorlock and fold the walls in a bungled mess
creations-chat 2023-07-06 19:38:14 For Titanic, being 269m long, 28m wide, in pc it would be 384 blocks long and 40 blocks wide, so with 7-8 accounts you can build a full scale Titanic with interior
creations-chat 2023-07-07 16:27:39 yea they will get bigger, by 2 blocks in width and a few blocks in lenght
creations-chat 2023-07-10 19:01:10 https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/384025409945337856/1127754334873071697 <@742181369601327215> Your ship has too shallow of a freeboard for its width and superstructure size, I would reccomend removing the top deck of the superstructure and adding a deck for the hull, also the stern mast should be tilted to the back, not to the front, with those changes it could look a lot better
creations-chat 2023-07-10 19:17:56 What will pc2 fix with it? Also have fun waiting I guess


The plots are gonna be 2 blocks wider and a few blocks longer so good luck lol
creations-chat 2023-07-11 15:11:35 https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/384025409945337856/1128328366420930570 at best you could unscrew that with a wrench, no screwdriver is gonna do anything to it
creations-chat 2023-07-13 20:30:58 269 meters = 384 blocks
creations-chat 2023-07-14 09:43:45 What is this garbage I just read?
creations-chat 2023-07-14 09:53:24 To make a strong magnetic field you need a lot of current in a coil of copper wire
creations-chat 2023-07-14 10:00:18 No thats not a good idea, tesla coil secondary coils have a ton of thin copper wires, good for very high voltages, very bad for current

creations-chat 2023-07-16 10:20:02 First ships are almost always downvoted, for your ship its quite low in the water and frankly very bland, you should add details like windows, winches, railings, cargo hatches, deck details and stuff

I agree with doctorhayman that less saturated colors and textures would also help
creations-chat 2023-07-16 10:24:32 And you didnt answer, you just insulted them
creations-chat 2023-07-16 10:34:29 And they asked for feedback for making it better since it was their first ship
help 2023-07-16 11:50:49 do these colors look good for 1940s ocean liner?
help 2023-07-16 11:54:25 alright
creations-chat 2023-07-16 20:00:55 https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/384025409945337856/1130199535164076033 <@845583896963842069> pretty good job on the Titanic, though I have to say the interiors could use quite a lot of improvements and also the boiler rooms arent just boilers but also large uptakes with catwalks and ladders on them, the exterior could also use some work, desaturated colors would help along with less "blockyness", also the pool and grand staircase (if that is the grand staircase) are quite bad, also the engine room is very odd
creations-chat 2023-07-17 09:42:38 The bow could use a better shape, also those portholes could be replaced by black circle emoji and it would look much much better
creations-chat 2023-07-17 09:47:04 Well here is my 1910s ocean liner, black circle emoji as portholes and windows work very well
creations-chat 2023-07-17 09:57:51 Its 23 blocks wide with a 13 block free board and 9 block draught, its as wide as ships should be
creations-chat 2023-07-17 10:00:49 Too skinny bridge?
creations-chat 2023-07-17 10:02:56 Becouse thats how ocean liners of 1890s and early 1900s look like
creations-chat 2023-07-17 10:18:07 Unless you are building Titanic, add custom stuff
creations-chat 2023-07-17 10:41:47 Becouse tanks are very cramped with tiny interior, so it would take a huge amount of effort to make the interior
creations-chat 2023-07-17 12:25:15 Superstructures are white, always on passenger ships
creations-chat 2023-07-17 12:30:20 Becouse of... Fog?
creations-chat 2023-07-17 12:37:24 No passenger ship ever had superstructures of other colors, only white, if your windows make it look odd, then its the windows that look odd, not the color
creations-chat 2023-07-17 13:30:32 Fun fact: plots are 39 blocks tall, compared to 51 width and lenght
creations-chat 2023-07-17 13:35:25 Yup, the plots are tiny if you are building ships or buidings, and PC2 wont fix this as the plots will be increased to 53x69x(height not known), so multi account builds will still be usefull, my newest ship uses 4 accounts and folds like this
creations-chat 2023-07-17 13:38:17 Can you make plots larger? Consider using folds for your creation. Hard to do when there is no space for more folds
creations-chat 2023-07-17 13:40:20 And fun fact, the height of a plot is 39, but its 38 above the surface, theres a layer where you can build underground, becouse amazing coding
creations-chat 2023-07-17 14:13:48 Here is how I fit my largest single plot ship in, it also has full interior so motorlocking the hull is very complicated
creations-chat 2023-07-17 14:16:23 The only issue is sideways interior
