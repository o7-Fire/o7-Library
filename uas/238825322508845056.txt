plane-crazy 2020-03-19 19:04:40 The new version I made of that has slate textures so it's more accurate to the game but I had to remove the numbers because they got censored. :|
plane-crazy 2020-03-19 19:03:41 And I'm amazed at the amount of upvotes
plane-crazy 2020-03-19 19:03:30 It really isn't

plane-crazy 2019-11-29 03:17:35 He does get very problematic at times.
plane-crazy 2019-11-29 03:17:27 To be fair, can't blame you.
plane-crazy 2019-11-29 03:16:51 :I
plane-crazy 2019-11-29 03:16:36 But feels are besides the point
plane-crazy 2019-11-29 03:16:30 I feel bad for him
plane-crazy 2019-11-29 03:16:25 So atleast just unban him
plane-crazy 2019-11-29 03:16:15 He promised to stop spamming
plane-crazy 2019-11-29 03:16:07 However, he IS +13 and I told him to not spam outside of the dump
plane-crazy 2019-11-29 03:15:46 Okay, fair point.
plane-crazy 2019-11-29 03:14:24 Bruh indeed
plane-crazy 2019-11-29 03:14:12 Also it turns out he really is 14 and that image was just old
plane-crazy 2019-11-29 03:13:56 <@!414778672847781888> You absolute fool, the dark one shall be unbanned
plane-crazy 2019-11-29 03:01:22 Oh boy

plane-crazy 2019-11-29 03:00:08 Oh cool .D.
plane-crazy 2019-11-29 02:59:34 The image used to report him was an old one
plane-crazy 2019-11-29 02:59:24 He sent it a second ago

plane-crazy 2019-11-29 02:57:26 Thought you misspelled a bit of my name.
plane-crazy 2019-11-29 02:57:21 Oh nvm
plane-crazy 2019-11-29 02:57:12 Wdym how?
plane-crazy 2019-11-29 02:57:03 I'll do it as quickly as possible to prevent any suspicion ._ .
plane-crazy 2019-11-29 02:56:47 Noc, if I show you a screenshot of him tomorrow showing that he's over 13, will you unban him?
plane-crazy 2019-11-29 02:56:17 F... Okay, I was gonna ask him to send a screenshot to verify this but he can't right now.
plane-crazy 2019-11-29 02:55:58 Give me a minute
plane-crazy 2019-11-29 02:55:51 He's 14 now
plane-crazy 2019-11-29 02:55:49 Apparently the image he was reported with is an old image
plane-crazy 2019-11-29 02:55:38 Okay, hold on.
plane-crazy 2019-11-29 02:50:08 Trust me, I know how to get him to behave. :/
plane-crazy 2019-11-29 02:48:00 I take it an apology from him won't do?
plane-crazy 2019-11-29 02:47:53 = - =
plane-crazy 2019-11-29 02:47:16 I just want him to stay because I feel bad for him, he didn't mean to annoy anyone.
plane-crazy 2019-11-29 02:47:02 Oh no, I just don't have much to say
plane-crazy 2019-11-29 02:46:43 Okay...
plane-crazy 2019-11-29 02:46:39 Hmm... E_E
plane-crazy 2019-11-29 02:46:31 Was it in the dump?
plane-crazy 2019-11-29 02:46:27 Oh that.
plane-crazy 2019-11-29 02:46:21 Huh?
plane-crazy 2019-11-29 02:45:43 According to some devs a few months ago, if they didn't bother anyone, they could stay.
plane-crazy 2019-11-29 02:45:22 But I know there is.
plane-crazy 2019-11-29 02:45:20 I don't remember *who* exactly
plane-crazy 2019-11-29 02:45:10 Noc, there's been <13 users that have stayed due to their behavior.
plane-crazy 2019-11-29 02:44:35 It's stupid to ban him for that :I
plane-crazy 2019-11-29 02:44:28 It wasn't a big deal
plane-crazy 2019-11-29 02:44:18 Oh please, it was just an L on a UFO.
plane-crazy 2019-11-29 02:44:10 Yeah
plane-crazy 2019-11-29 02:44:07 We're actually good friends :I
plane-crazy 2019-11-29 02:43:51 Dude, he's just a little mischevious at times
plane-crazy 2019-11-29 02:43:38 Why'd you have to report my boi?
plane-crazy 2019-11-29 02:43:28 And the mods know about them

plane-crazy 2019-05-09 14:59:53 Rickje has pretty much no control over it
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 14:59:44 The data limit is because of roblox
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 14:59:36 No
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 14:59:22 Something related to the data limit
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 14:59:13 Rickje said something about being unable to do such a thing
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 22:20:02 I is building coostom ship in Starbound.

plane-crazy 2019-05-05 22:18:54 You could use friction blocks to add grip to stuff
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 22:18:34 I sure do wonder what it does
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 22:18:25 It's called a friction block
