bug-reports 2020-12-22 18:22:32 When spawning stuff at rails, when someone sits in your seat, they can phase through your build. Just like if you would've blacklisted someone. Please fix this. It's really annoying.
creations-chat 2020-12-25 17:19:15 <@456226577798135808> stupid question. How u make the black pattern on the side of ur blimp?
