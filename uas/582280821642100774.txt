creations-chat 2022-08-02 01:10:32 why do most creations that are not overlocked military vehicles get so much downvotes?
creations-chat 2022-08-02 01:12:54 oh hi there i didnt expect to see you again
creations-chat 2022-08-13 01:00:23 Heavy wip (work in progress) VTOL military dropship/gunship, still gotta add the 8 custom engines, another pair of wings and maybe arms (yes, you read it right, arms);

Thinking about adding rocket pods;

Heavily inspired by the Grabber from intrusion 2, and 2 concept art images i found on page 2 of google.

(Also has 4 spring powered ejectable seats to save the crew [pilot, copilot, gunner and flight engineer])
creations-chat 2022-08-13 01:04:19 still has lots of details to add, also, it would be useful if players had something like a personal flashlight to help with depth perception (it was a little tricky to detail the interior since everything is the same color)
creations-chat 2022-08-13 01:19:37 not mine, just a cool bomber i saw and wanted to share
creations-chat 2022-08-13 01:21:13 its a matter of opinion, i think it looks quite decent for an average player, its fine if you dont like it, it's not even mine anyways
creations-chat 2022-08-13 01:25:07 yea whatever, i like to think that instead of insulting unexperienced players for their low-effort builds, it would be nice to compliment these players to encourage them to get better and learn to build (as i said before, its just a matter of opinion, no problem if you dont agree)

i also also apologize if my grammar is bad/horrible, english is not my primary language

creations-chat 2022-09-06 01:09:48 i upvoted both because i always upvote all creations for some reason, but a literal spaceship got over 70 downvotes while a tiny sailboat got over 130 upvotes, what is wrong with pcc?
