help 2022-06-22 05:47:24 Center of mass
help 2022-06-22 05:47:53 You could put helium all at the front of the build but if it’s apply at center it’ll lift the entire thing and not just the nose
help 2022-06-22 05:48:40 yes
help 2022-06-22 05:49:05 I think the center of mass changes after you fold
help 2022-06-22 05:49:08 But I’m not sure
help 2022-06-22 05:50:59 Anything’s possible
help 2022-06-22 05:51:07 Just fixed update
help 2022-06-22 05:51:09 Really
help 2022-06-22 05:51:17 Then do some math shite to find the center
help 2022-06-22 05:51:40 Like if half your build gets destroyed but it still balances on the original center of mass
help 2022-06-22 05:51:47 It’ll be really stupid
help 2022-06-22 05:51:59 So of course it has to change in real time
help 2022-06-22 05:55:14 Check center of mass
help 2022-06-22 05:55:22 One side could be heavier
help 2022-06-22 05:55:29 Also, try putting ballasts
help 2022-06-22 05:55:31 It helps

creations-chat 2022-08-06 16:09:15 I’m getting lambasted in <#384025409945337856> rn but it’s honestly funny so I’m gonna keep doing it
creations-chat 2022-08-06 16:13:37 Yeah, I do mostly pvp so i usually favor function over appearance, so not alot of my builds look good, i dont really care though. I’ll improve over time
