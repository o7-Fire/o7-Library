The Tale of Vancash2015 (480944020886126612)
creations-chat 2020-03-31 00:34:00 I'm gonna get bullied if this turns out to be a joke, but possibly the wing-to-fuselage ratio
creations-chat 2020-03-31 00:34:44 Make the wings longer, and make the width about two-four blocks wider
creations-chat 2020-03-31 00:35:39 Oh... a flying tank
creations-chat 2020-03-31 00:35:44 I'm scared now

creations-chat 2020-04-01 21:12:29 "The Dart" IDK, I made another jet (Based off no other IRL Design). This is my first Jet, so I decided to Start Small at 219 Blocks. BTW, since I'm new to this, give me as much criticisms about the design as you want.
creations-chat 2020-04-01 21:12:48 P.S. I'm still bad at painting
creations-chat 2020-04-01 21:12:51 
creations-chat 2020-04-01 21:13:59 BTW, it can get up to 200 MPH at full thrust.
creations-chat 2020-04-01 22:10:42 <@!323414243074506763>  So... Set the Stabilizers lower, Move the Wings back (and make them a bit shorter), take away the pyramid at the nose, and make the wings more aesthetically appealing, as well as making the canopy only show the upper half of the avatar? (BTW, with the wings, I've noticed many use motors to control their stabilizers. To maintain both aesthetic, and maneuverability, would you suggest using that for my wings, or use another technique?

help 2020-04-02 23:24:36 My Jet is having trouble flying. Each time I get it off the ground, it will tip it's nose upward, and flip over.
help 2020-04-02 23:25:10 I believe it has to do with the lift factor of the wings, but it also has trouble getting off the ground.

creations-chat 2020-04-07 04:04:42 Does anyone have a 2,000+ Block Ex. of a Military (Non-VTOL) Aircraft I've been thinking of making a B-52, or B-17, but I'm not sure if it would be plausible to accurately depict one with that size. I'm just fishing for inspiration and can't find any examples on YT. Obviously, I won't copy it (I wouldn't be able to anyway for the life of my non-existent turtle), but I want  to narrow down the possibilities further. RN, I've narrowed down the types of Aircraft to Bomber, or Cargo.
creations-chat 2020-04-07 04:08:55 Yeah, IK I could make an over-scaled Fighter Jet, but I kinda like making things which are too scale IRL relative to a blocky avatar.
creations-chat 2020-04-07 04:12:37 I was just analyzing some pictures of a B-52 Stratofortress, and it looks more fun to build relative to the B-17. Although with the wing-to-fuselage ratio, it seems kinda difficult to make an accurately scaled aircraft without folding.
creations-chat 2020-04-07 04:16:12 I've never folded wings before
creations-chat 2020-04-07 04:17:00 Is it the same as folding normal blocks, or will I have to change the 'thickness' of the wings?
creations-chat 2020-04-07 04:21:47 I might wanna use thin wings, as the B-52 does have relatively thin wings itself, and even half blocks could make it appear to large
help 2020-04-07 04:23:27 Are their any tips I need to know when folding thin wings?
help 2020-04-07 04:23:39 *there
help 2020-04-07 04:29:19 If I used thicker wings, would I just still have to keep all blocks clear of the sides of the motor I'm folding from?
help 2020-04-07 04:31:34 I just mean one with about a half-block to a block on top of the build
help 2020-04-07 04:33:50 <@!162156549978980352> Have you tried four motor folds? I haven't made a ship which required folds, but that's how a lot of Expert Shipwrights make those huge carriers.
help 2020-04-07 04:36:18 Okay, that makes sense. I was trying to figure out where the motors were.
help 2020-04-07 04:36:42 Right
help 2020-04-07 04:37:51 Alright, I will see how I do.
creations-chat 2020-04-13 04:17:10 This is my B1 Lancer, it's approximately 447 blocks, and has a max flat angle speed of 674 SPS. Let me know what I could do to improve the model, and what kind of engine formats I could use to produce thrust more efficiently (I jammed a bunch of rocket engines in the fuselage).
creations-chat 2020-04-13 04:17:11 
creations-chat 2020-04-13 04:17:12 
creations-chat 2020-04-13 04:23:19 BTW, I just noticed the last instance of the image captured of the B1 is glitched (The engine casing, and left wing are not visible, despite pointing toward the capture.) Don't worry, all assets are actually there.

help 2020-04-21 03:53:09 Yo, so MB I misused the Creations Chat, but I wanted to know if there were any potential improvements I could make into the aesthetic design of the aircraft.
creations-chat 2020-04-21 03:53:40 Nope...
creations-chat 2020-04-21 03:55:50 Uh... I guess I'm new to pinging 'etiquette.' lol
help 2020-04-21 03:57:52 Yeah... Whenever I fly it, I cannot quite get into vertical climb. Would that have something to do with most of the wings being on the stabilizers, and major wing surface?
creations-chat 2020-04-21 04:01:15 BTW... can you request to take down a creations post on the grounds that you pinged someone on said creations post? Asking for a friend.
