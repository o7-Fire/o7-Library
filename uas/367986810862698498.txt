bot-central 2020-11-04 11:57:09 ?Suggest [Lockable Motor 2]
[Configurable]
As the name suggests, Motor 2s must have an option to act as a locked motor. This can be of great help when people are trying to toggle lock a piece at a specific angle. Say for example people would like to get a 1x7 beam block into a position where if locked it can act as a 1x7 wedge. With a normal locked motor it can be finicky for a builder to hold the forwards or backwards button and release it when they think its in position, if they fail the outcome won't look right forcing them to respawn and try again. Rinse repeat. With a toggleable and lockable Motor 2 you can set and angle and simply get it into position from a push of a button, no hassle
