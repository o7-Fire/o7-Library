bug-reports 2018-10-14 14:10:22 So are we stuck with the broken saves until rick saves it or will we revert all changes when mad comes online ?
bug-reports 2018-10-14 14:10:50 Cause if the saving just times out does it mean I wasted the entirety of today rebuilding the shuttle ?
bug-reports 2018-10-14 14:10:53 yes
bug-reports 2018-10-14 14:11:10 Vote for revert until the update is fixed
bug-reports 2018-10-14 14:11:48 honestly just revert it to the previous version

bug-reports 2018-10-15 12:48:21 (((please fix asap)))
bug-reports 2018-10-15 15:15:25 ?????
bug-reports 2018-10-15 15:26:40 wielding is not having toggle enabled and them just constantly pulling eachother
bug-reports 2018-10-15 15:27:05 wielding is you activating them when close and it the magnets just stick to eachother until you acivate them again
bug-reports 2018-10-15 15:27:09 no lag at all
bug-reports 2018-10-15 15:30:09 <@!217336009455566848> Maybe you fixing the wielding is what removed it ? What was the problem ? having the magnet attach to any blocks is honestly how it should work, that way you can have woeking cranes and such
bug-reports 2018-10-15 15:30:27 perhaps bring the "bug" back, but only have magnets attract other magnets ?
bug-reports 2018-10-15 15:30:34 but let anything stick to the magnets
bug-reports 2018-10-15 15:32:15 as in a magnet can only attract another magnet
bug-reports 2018-10-15 15:32:32 but any block at all will be attached to it if the magnet is activated close enough
bug-reports 2018-10-15 15:45:03 there was no problem though
bug-reports 2018-10-15 15:45:34 I have not heard of a single instance where the wielding was breaking someone's build

the-dump 2018-10-16 12:26:27 So basically I was on my phone watching another tutorial on YouTube on how to clean your asshole for gay sex when my wife suddenly burst into the bathroom. By instinct I pressed the lock screen button but recently I had bought YouTube Premium so the video kept playing in the background at full volume, much to my horror and despair. I tried unlocking my phone to close the app but my fingers were too moist from my cleaning operation and so I sat there while the man in the video started moaning, my wife finally figuring out that I was gay. We divorced the next day.

creations-chat 2018-11-08 20:45:42 there's also a bug with anchor blocks which I'm not sure is fixed but I know a way to avoid it for the most part
creations-chat 2018-11-08 21:00:39 basically when anchored the part that had the anchor block would push you to a side
creations-chat 2018-11-08 21:00:57 by part I mean something attached with a motor
creations-chat 2018-11-08 21:01:42 it could be avoided by putting anchor blocks on the attached parts, but aparently everyone else who gets on your build is still getting pushed

the-dump 2019-01-15 18:26:14 I thought you said "steamed clams"
the-dump 2019-01-15 18:33:47 You call hamburgers "steamed hams?"
the-dump 2019-01-15 18:38:43 Uh-huh... uh, what region?
the-dump 2019-01-15 18:39:29 Really? Well, I'm from Utica, and I've never heard anyone use the phrase "steamed hams."
the-dump 2019-01-15 18:40:15 I see.
the-dump 2019-01-15 18:40:26 You know, these hamburgers are quite similar to the ones they have at Krusty Burger.
the-dump 2019-01-15 18:41:18 For steamed hams?
the-dump 2019-01-15 18:41:49 Yeah, so you call them "steamed hams" despite the fact they are obviously grilled.
the-dump 2019-01-15 18:42:45 Of course.
the-dump 2019-01-15 18:43:16 Yes, I should be-

the-dump 2019-03-01 21:27:39 james is the guy to publicly bash a guy's head against a wall and  then execute them
the-dump 2019-03-01 21:29:22 because thy are not worthy
the-dump 2019-03-01 21:30:02 nah
the-dump 2019-03-01 21:30:12 well
the-dump 2019-03-01 21:30:17 last time we heard mad's opinion
the-dump 2019-03-01 21:30:18 was like
the-dump 2019-03-01 21:30:20 3 months ago
the-dump 2019-03-01 21:30:27 when rick just started working on the game
the-dump 2019-03-01 21:30:33 we had 20 people average
the-dump 2019-03-01 21:30:40 so yeah
the-dump 2019-03-01 21:31:49 heres the thing
the-dump 2019-03-01 21:31:58 only rick can do any sort of punishemnts
the-dump 2019-03-01 21:35:25 only 1 and he's busy most of the time
the-dump 2019-03-01 21:39:17 where else do you want it to be
the-dump 2019-03-01 21:39:40 ah yes blame james
the-dump 2019-03-01 21:40:36 setting that up is too *h a r d*
the-dump 2019-03-01 21:40:54 so if we ever get ingame mods that would probably the best solution for us

the-dump 2019-03-01 21:46:23 rick has a cmd set up so he can delete the current slot
the-dump 2019-03-01 21:46:37 so if its a flying swastika he can get rid of it instantly
the-dump 2019-03-01 21:46:45 doesnt work on other slots
the-dump 2019-03-01 21:47:01 james
the-dump 2019-03-01 21:47:24 he means being able to see other people's builds and delete them without having to join the game would be faster and easier
the-dump 2019-03-01 21:47:58 yeah thats not possible

help 2021-06-09 17:43:32 there's no ingame moderation
help 2021-06-09 17:43:39 we cant do anything
help 2021-06-09 17:51:52 nah he has a point
help 2021-06-09 17:52:31 reports closed because the only person with ingame mod didnt want to deal with them for one reason or another
help 2021-06-09 17:52:48 rickje lol
help 2021-06-09 17:53:09 there's more than enough volunteers believe me
help 2021-06-09 17:53:19 we even wrote a moderation script specifically for the game
help 2021-06-09 17:53:30 its not like we dont care that there's cheaters and lag bombs
help 2021-06-09 17:53:41 it's just that none of that got implemented and none of us can do anything
help 2021-06-09 17:54:01 so all that we're left with is saving builds and finding a new server to not give those people attention
help 2021-06-09 17:55:36 its not because he just doesnt care
help 2021-06-09 17:55:56 he did tell a reason why a moderation script could end up causing problems for the game
help 2021-06-09 17:56:13 however after months of different solutions and ideas we all got tired so here we are
help 2021-06-09 17:57:08 not really since its already been written over a year ago
