bug-reports 2022-04-25 23:38:03 I spent 8 hours on a BattleBot in this game. The save file didn't work correctly and now random parts of the bot isn't saved
bug-reports 2022-04-25 23:38:15 I would attach a pic but I don't have perms
bug-reports 2022-04-25 23:39:24 I sent it to a mod.
bug-reports 2022-04-25 23:39:31 Maybe that will help.
bug-reports 2022-04-25 23:40:43 Ah my bad.
bug-reports 2022-04-25 23:46:32 I am just panicking. That shit took forever to make.
bug-reports 2022-04-26 01:13:41 It was 7.0k blocks.
bug-reports 2022-04-26 01:14:49 Lemme get this straight. If someone's big ass boat has the same glitch, everyone cares. But when a BattleBot glitches it doesn't matter?
bug-reports 2022-04-26 01:15:17 Wow. Gotta love this community.
bug-reports 2022-04-26 01:15:59 I don't use them in public servers?
bug-reports 2022-04-26 01:17:23 Why are you even making a comment. I just want to report a glitch. Bro just violated a chunk out of the PCC.
bug-reports 2022-04-26 01:18:11 Sigh. I was just pissed at this guy.
bug-reports 2022-04-26 01:18:33 I'm sure not all y'all like that.
bug-reports 2022-04-26 01:18:52 Whatever tho, I'll just leave this or some shit.
bug-reports 2022-04-26 19:54:27 Tiny? A 7k bot, with a custom paint job, 44x44, which took 8 hours not even counting the paint, is tiny?
bug-reports 2022-04-26 19:55:39 Ok and?
bug-reports 2022-04-26 19:55:43 Still isn't tiny.
bug-reports 2022-04-28 21:50:19 Ight so the blocks getting deleted save glitch happen again after I redid the whole thing. I made sure the wifi was good, and it was saved correctly.
bug-reports 2022-04-28 21:50:32 I don't want help j just wanted to let you know.
events-chat 2022-04-30 21:27:56 Yea i want a bot too.

events-chat 2022-04-30 21:35:42 Or is that banned.
events-chat 2022-04-30 21:51:17 Yea, me and ud are experienced bot builders, and the fling and shred physics are pretty bad.
events-chat 2022-04-30 21:52:03 RBK, if i reroll can i choose between the two?
events-chat 2022-04-30 21:52:53 And its every battlebot ever?
events-chat 2022-04-30 21:57:40 LOL
events-chat 2022-04-30 21:58:02 IM DOING THAT ITS A CONFIG, THEY BROUGHT IT TO THE SHOW
events-chat 2022-04-30 21:58:34 THIS GONNA BE SO FUNNY
events-chat 2022-04-30 21:58:59 You mean the cow wrangler?
events-chat 2022-04-30 21:59:53 Ight imma do vert hydra
events-chat 2022-04-30 22:00:10 this gonna be straight comedy.
events-chat 2022-04-30 22:01:05 WAIT SO I CAN MAKE THE FLIPPER VERSION TOO. ðŸ’€
events-chat 2022-04-30 22:01:38 For hydra. It was a config they brought to the show
events-chat 2022-04-30 22:02:29 Also i might make the bar a bar or 4 tooth.
events-chat 2022-04-30 22:03:21 mino is a great draw
events-chat 2022-05-01 19:38:45 Just a bot i built not for the competition
events-chat 2022-05-01 20:15:06 This isn't for the competition.
events-chat 2022-05-01 20:15:24 Steampunk themed.
events-chat 2022-05-02 03:32:51 I am a YT and that's my pfp, as a gear.
events-chat 2022-05-02 20:39:49 Could I get a reroll? I don't like Hydra. If it's not a impossible build I'll do it.
events-chat 2022-05-02 20:40:11 Hydra is just boring af.
events-chat 2022-05-02 20:45:01 Nah, I was but hadn't.
events-chat 2022-05-02 20:48:11 I can work with that.
events-chat 2022-05-03 01:14:44 Mad Catter is already 3.6k blocks.
events-chat 2022-05-03 01:15:35 https://tenor.com/view/hulk-you-guys-are-so-screwed-now-you-guys-are-ahhh-ha-ahhh-ha-hulk-gif-23490086
events-chat 2022-05-03 01:27:31 This might be my biggest yet at maybe 5k
events-chat 2022-05-03 02:03:20 Is he entering that? Cause I might have to go bigger.
events-chat 2022-05-03 02:03:36 Even tho like 70 percent of my bot is beams.
events-chat 2022-05-03 03:20:28 Ight I'll get a pick of it so far
events-chat 2022-05-03 03:21:22 Also, why have the ballast count at 4 but 20 cutters. You would be better off just increasing the ballast limit so the weight is more even.
events-chat 2022-05-03 03:22:49 About half done with building it.
events-chat 2022-05-03 03:23:58 Watch it fling and shit
events-chat 2022-05-03 16:52:43 It makes it so you can't take recoil, and darts people more.
events-chat 2022-05-03 17:20:52 Preferably?
events-chat 2022-05-03 17:21:42 What do you have in mind for a edit. I did something small, with a certain point job on the bar which is from a newer season, but looks better.
events-chat 2022-05-03 17:22:33 If you want to tack on a spare weapon on the back, then that isnt accurate enough.
events-chat 2022-05-04 02:16:56 Key gonna help us stomp.
events-chat 2022-05-04 03:27:40 Stomp as in make chomp, but bad!
events-chat 2022-05-04 03:28:23 No I meant us get stomped by these amazing builds. Fr tho.
