creations-chat 2021-05-13 23:02:53 thx
creations-chat 2021-05-14 00:02:30 I actually somewhat improved the Jet Truck Now
creations-chat 2021-05-14 00:10:56 Ok I thank someone for whoever reposted the shockwave jet truck photo, I missed that silver aspect near the motors. plus the wheels, there is unfortunately no wheel that actually matches the massive tires that the Jet Truck has
bot-central 2021-05-14 00:11:49 ?shelp
creations-chat 2021-05-14 00:14:53 Well true, but how in the heck am I going to be able to make it turn, steer, all that jazz?
creations-chat 2021-05-14 00:19:12 now for the steering ratio, How am I gonna make the front wheels (FWD) turn to go around corners?
creations-chat 2021-05-14 00:22:07 welll here is the question, do I use motor 2 for the steering or do I use the motor?
creations-chat 2021-05-14 00:24:31 or I should the non servoed motor or the servoed motor for the steering
creations-chat 2021-05-14 00:29:45 y'know, the motor without a servo and the motor with a servo?
creations-chat 2021-05-14 00:49:49 Ok so got the servo motors in the front, but there is a slight issue, IDK if the servo needs to be connected to anything to turn
bot-central 2021-05-14 01:35:27 !rank
creations-chat 2021-05-14 01:36:32 Still wondering if the servo part needs something connected to it to, well, turn
creations-chat 2021-05-14 01:52:40 Hmmm interesting, the servo doesn't want to turn the wheel
creations-chat 2021-05-14 03:16:35 Yay the steering is working (minus the fact it is a different steering setup
creations-chat 2021-05-14 03:38:04 the Truck actually doesn't have VTOL support, HOWEVER it would work as like a high speed tank or whatever
creations-chat 2021-05-14 03:41:12 oops forgot about the HUD stuff my bad
bot-central 2021-05-14 03:43:22 !rank
creations-chat 2021-05-14 03:44:23 Hang on a bit, I think the downvotes happened cause I forgot 1. adding the lights to the sides and 2. the HUD was online so uhh this should be a bit better
creations-chat 2021-05-14 03:47:42 this time, I t will be in the dark so you can see what it looks like at night
creations-chat 2021-05-14 03:50:45 geez the small wing lights are so hard to see
creations-chat 2021-05-14 03:54:06 Ok that pic should be better so you can see the small wing lights (Amber Lights) on one side of the truck. There is another side with lights also so both sides are lit
creations-chat 2021-05-14 03:57:17 oh yeah
creations-chat 2021-05-14 03:59:49 How wide do ya think it needs to be?
creations-chat 2021-05-14 04:18:13 OOF Roblox crashed
creations-chat 2021-05-14 04:38:29 So uhh Ross, is the cab of the truck going to be needed extend out or?

creations-chat 2021-05-14 05:10:41 How is the motor detailing going to work for me? IDK if there are any parts to make the motors even more detailed, but I will think about it
creations-chat 2021-05-14 05:44:03 Heading to be now so gn guys
creations-chat 2021-05-14 22:28:30 I have now finished rebuilding the Jet Truck, and hopefully is more realistic somewhat

creations-chat 2021-05-14 22:48:48 thanks man
creations-chat 2021-05-14 23:00:35 I just realized that the truck didn't have the reflective material as in the reference photo, so I am rematerializing the parts to make it look like it has the Carbon Fiber
creations-chat 2021-05-14 23:24:12 there the Jet Truck has a Metal Material (wish there was a Carbon Fiber Material) for the reflective aspect

creations-chat 2021-05-14 23:41:05 Hang on HUD stuff  active
creations-chat 2021-05-14 23:44:09 Srry, just tryna be Perfect
creations-chat 2021-05-14 23:46:44 Like legit, if the HUD stuff are active, then the downvotes could be CATASTROPHIC, also updates are required since this is the feedback spec
creations-chat 2021-05-15 00:55:37 Ok so I did some revision and does this look good or nah?
creations-chat 2021-05-15 00:57:48 
creations-chat 2021-05-15 00:59:49 Well then, just report the guy then we don't have to worry about it
creations-chat 2021-05-15 01:02:46 Oh wait... I forgot that the <#623337136267067393> section is completely closed off and it will not be validated until a new reporting system is found. Hate it when the reporting sector is, well, gone
creations-chat 2021-05-15 01:05:16 I also replaced the standard Jet Motors With what the reference pic has (The Rocket Engines)
creations-chat 2021-05-15 01:14:42 Ok I have covered the gap there for you. Including the gap that I can see near the 1X3 wedges
creations-chat 2021-05-15 01:18:32 or I should say the 1X2 wedges
creations-chat 2021-05-15 01:21:25 
creations-chat 2021-05-15 01:23:33 The gradient? the heck is the gradient?
creations-chat 2021-05-15 01:25:36 How in the heck do I do the gradient spec? I don't know if that feature for the coloring Is added to the game.
creations-chat 2021-05-15 01:52:06 I currently working on the gradient effect actually, they are going to be about 2 blocks for each
creations-chat 2021-05-15 02:07:03 oof the 2 block gradient doesn't work well so gonna try 1 block per section
creations-chat 2021-05-15 02:54:27 alrighty, My Jet Truck has a gradient colorization and should be a ton better
creations-chat 2021-05-15 02:56:29 OOF! Roblox crashed out somehow
creations-chat 2021-05-15 03:01:00 Luckily, My Jet Truck in its current state now saved
creations-chat 2021-05-15 03:03:58 Here is what it looks like now

creations-chat 2021-05-15 06:53:54 I just realized I forgot 2 different wedges (Normal Wedge and 1X2 Wedge) and a single block holding the normal wedge
creations-chat 2021-05-15 06:58:24 ok it is updated, let me screenshot what I was missing compared to the reference pic
creations-chat 2021-05-15 07:01:43 In this pic, you can see a curvature in the open spot below the cab
creations-chat 2021-05-15 07:04:37 I completely forgot about that part and had to add it in. This is what it looks like now:
creations-chat 2021-05-15 07:07:35 (Sorry about the steering spec. That needed to be added for the truck to turn. Unfortunately, the truck does drift when that steering is around so uhh
creations-chat 2021-05-15 07:10:13 Anywho, I have added that piece and will now wait till I can do a reupload for the update.

creations-chat 2021-05-15 20:32:16 Here is the updated version of the jet Truck This time with the black smoke representing the Fire coming out of the smoke stacks (wish they add a Flame effect to the game)
creations-chat 2021-05-15 20:37:07 toxic much Fortniter? I mean yeah it is your opinion, but still Toxic Much?
creations-chat 2021-05-15 20:42:00 Huh ok so I added the sparkler, but the Smoke pipes Fell off, IDK in I need to double the smoke stacks or what
creations-chat 2021-05-15 20:49:59 I tryna do the sparklers, but they make the smoke pipe part fall off, same thing but this time the Sparkler falls off when on the Smoke pipe, does that me I need to double up my smoke stacks to hold the Sparkler?
creations-chat 2021-05-15 20:53:04 That was towards DontShootUrselfPlez, since he could be a fortniter and we don't know that
creations-chat 2021-05-15 21:01:29 the wheels are small yes, but that is the maximum size I can do (cylinder 5X5) there is no bigger size for it. also the sparklers cause the smoke pipe to fall off and vice versa. The Spotlight works, but the light effect doesn't go into the smoke stacks I think, unless I was doing it wrong since I did see a yellow part show up when in build mode
