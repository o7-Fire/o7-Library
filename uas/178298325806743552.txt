help 2019-04-30 17:39:01 Could someone tell me what anti-lag does for magnets? I don't know if I'd be making any compromises by turning it on or off.
help 2019-04-30 17:45:27 Alright, thanks.
bug-reports 2019-04-30 18:43:41 I keep getting kicked for unexpected client behavior when I try to unfold my Space Shuttle. Essentially what I do is unfold half of the build, magnet, unfold the other half, and then magnet. In the process of using magnets on the second half is when I get kicked.
help 2019-05-02 20:03:47 Could someone tell me now to counteract a spinning motion that any helicopter or quadcopter will have due to the game's physics?

-Multi-staged: includes first and second stages
-Made to scale
-Working Fairing

Expert Scientist

`Note`
In order to make the Falcon 1 to scale, I had to make compromises. For one, there is no disconnector. The second stage just isn't held in.
I also would've been unable to make the fairing fall off without making the second stage ugly.
