bug-reports 2021-04-21 18:41:37 That’s been in plane crazy for awhile
bug-reports 2021-04-24 12:26:23 That happens to me a lot in plane crazy it would help with skydiving if the glitch is removed
bug-reports 2021-07-13 15:19:09 My aircraft keeps glitching but I can’t show it because of the photo thing is disabled
bug-reports 2021-07-13 15:21:55 So basically the motors are broken again
bug-reports 2021-07-13 15:28:49 The aircraft glitches even when the motor is off
bug-reports 2021-07-13 15:29:06 And rejoining does not help
bug-reports 2021-07-13 15:30:58 That was my first idea on the glitching but it still glitching even though it is lowered and I even have the torque to 1
bug-reports 2021-07-13 15:32:28 I even tried replacing the motor and yet it still glitches
bug-reports 2021-07-13 15:47:40 How am I going to fast
bug-reports 2021-07-13 15:48:47 The speed is not at 50
bug-reports 2021-07-13 15:48:54 It’s like 15
bug-reports 2021-07-13 15:49:43 I have another aircraft with the same motor at max torque and speed and it does not glitch
bug-reports 2021-07-13 21:32:13 I can’t since the photo thing is disabled for me

bug-reports 2022-09-24 02:38:10 It needs to be priority for now since it is annoying if I had to guess I bet Roblox itself is the issue
bug-reports 2022-09-29 16:58:53 Actually the sign bug can be useful as whiteboards and such on ships etc well basically anything you use it for during launch
bug-reports 2022-09-29 18:05:00 Yes
