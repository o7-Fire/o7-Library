Additional note: this was just recently, I think they rejoined another server. (as of 9/4/2020, 13:36). I'm also worried they might try and use another account if banned since the lag machine was ball spam.
Note 2: shortly after they left, half the server also did, resulting in only 3 players including myself left.

creations-chat 2020-04-09 14:00:21 Osprey F1.A (first variant, VTOL possible but vertical landing is very hard).
creations-chat 2020-04-09 14:00:46 yes i turned off the engines in flight for a screenshot
creations-chat 2020-04-09 14:02:15 also if i were to cover the top the engines wouldn't turn
creations-chat 2020-04-09 14:02:25 thus an Osprey F1.B, second variant no VTOL.

help 2020-04-09 18:19:24 in front of the centre might also cause problems, how it might I'm still thinking about
help 2020-04-09 18:19:46 yeah in front of idk
help 2020-04-09 18:20:03 Behind is a definitive working propulsion system however.
help 2020-04-09 18:20:19 Directly at the centre is also likely to work.

bug-reports 2020-04-14 09:38:00 This shouldn't happen in real life, but for some reason it happens in Plane Crazy. When retracting small/tiny landing gear, the entire plane moves down instead of just the landing gear moving up.

creations-chat 2020-04-14 14:09:20 "The folklore is: ... was a P-38 Lightning pilot and had to bail out. Well early on this was fatal for many P-38 pilots as they got killed on the cross stabilizer between the two nacelles. ... A remedy for this was eventually a pilot's seat that was ejected from the cockpit, a forerunner of today's versions."
