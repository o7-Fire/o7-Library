help 2021-06-07 03:09:21 Say, should we be able to place pictures of our creations directly from our files, or do we have to copy/paste them?

creations-chat 2021-06-07 03:21:56 Forget the argument, I wanna hear the backstory behind that username.
help 2021-06-07 03:25:33 You could probably tuck in some lights. I'd use spot lights and set them to where they shine straight ahead.
help 2021-06-07 03:25:47 I can't really explain it any better.

the-dump 2021-06-07 18:22:38 The top two are super strong diesels, the bottom left is a steam locomotive (old-fashioned), and the bottom right is a diesel-electric that runs like crap.
the-dump 2021-06-07 18:23:00 Which makes it unfunny
the-dump 2021-06-07 18:23:02 Big sad
creations-chat 2021-06-07 18:25:55 Feedback is appreciated very much on the Big Boy.
creations-chat 2021-06-07 18:28:00 You were pretty accurate on design. I like it.

creations-chat 2021-06-08 14:20:51 Any ideas for any locomotives I should build? Really don't know where to put this so it's just going here.
creations-chat 2021-06-14 21:54:08 As a fellow train builder I am proud.
