plane-crazy 2020-07-14 07:11:29 for that too
plane-crazy 2020-07-14 07:10:53 kick the laggers
plane-crazy 2020-07-14 07:10:34 yes
plane-crazy 2020-07-14 07:10:23 we need a vote kick system
plane-crazy 2020-07-12 17:01:01 I don't think planes are supposed to fly that way ðŸ˜³
plane-crazy 2020-07-06 11:41:20 just make a dual propeller plane with motor wings
plane-crazy 2020-07-06 11:40:25 *that's what I tried with my first UFO*
plane-crazy 2020-07-06 11:40:14 why not both
plane-crazy 2020-07-06 11:39:29 looks nice
plane-crazy 2020-07-06 11:38:53 I tried making one like that but quit because I didn't care enough
plane-crazy 2020-07-06 11:38:33 UFO
plane-crazy 2020-07-06 05:46:56 *** t a l l***
plane-crazy 2020-07-05 23:08:24 it sent me it, I thought it was a channel
plane-crazy 2020-07-05 23:07:33 I don't have that channel
plane-crazy 2020-07-05 23:07:17 the random stops breaks it quickly
plane-crazy 2020-07-05 23:07:04 there's not enough time,by the time I get the gif open it's already broken
plane-crazy 2020-07-05 23:06:17 why do my motors keep randomly stopping
plane-crazy 2020-07-05 22:50:04 I don't even know what I'm looking at
plane-crazy 2020-07-05 22:45:13 I've been trying to do this for 3 days and nothing is working
plane-crazy 2020-07-05 22:42:41 is it attached to the circle or is there an unpowered motor
plane-crazy 2020-07-05 22:37:40 what
plane-crazy 2020-07-05 22:36:55 if it's this then it doesn't work the way I need it to
plane-crazy 2020-07-05 22:36:04 what's that
plane-crazy 2020-07-05 22:35:45 I need it to move in a bit of a circle
plane-crazy 2020-07-05 22:35:26 I'm trying to make a dancing parrot from minecraft
plane-crazy 2020-07-05 22:34:58 I'd rather not spam the buttons
plane-crazy 2020-07-05 22:34:48 I need it to push and pull
plane-crazy 2020-07-05 22:34:10 pistons need a reset option
plane-crazy 2020-07-05 21:33:07 yes
plane-crazy 2020-07-05 21:32:25 because I can't see what I'm doing
plane-crazy 2020-07-05 21:31:18 we need a setting to remove this annoying thing
plane-crazy 2020-07-05 05:44:24 my solution is the biggest of brain ideas
plane-crazy 2020-07-05 05:43:42 add blocks to the game
plane-crazy 2020-07-04 23:37:06 jesus tank
plane-crazy 2020-07-04 20:07:24 shopping cart with arms
plane-crazy 2020-07-04 20:06:49 it's CLAW
plane-crazy 2020-07-04 20:06:44 yes
plane-crazy 2020-07-04 20:05:51 someone, please make it
plane-crazy 2020-07-04 10:59:40 come inside it's fun inside
plane-crazy 2020-07-04 09:41:57 at least I can access #deleted-channel
plane-crazy 2020-07-04 09:40:59 what rank do you need to be able to see it
plane-crazy 2020-07-04 09:39:48 where are they
plane-crazy 2020-07-04 09:39:29 where is the VIP channels
plane-crazy 2020-07-04 09:31:59 just a low graphics thing
plane-crazy 2020-07-04 09:31:40 that's on Roblox's end
plane-crazy 2020-07-04 08:39:58 I don't even know the name of the movie
plane-crazy 2020-07-04 08:39:52 I've never seen the movie, only the clip
plane-crazy 2020-07-04 08:39:07 not many people will get the reference
plane-crazy 2020-07-04 07:19:14 I made the Phoenix Lights
plane-crazy 2020-07-04 05:29:51 those things are terrifying
plane-crazy 2020-07-04 05:29:45 someone needs to make a realistic goblin shark
plane-crazy 2020-07-04 04:08:10 "ur brand bad, bye bye"
plane-crazy 2020-07-04 04:06:49 nothing changes
plane-crazy 2020-07-04 04:06:44 I've tried from 1 to 7 length
plane-crazy 2020-07-04 04:06:02 that doesn't change anything
plane-crazy 2020-07-04 04:05:47 everyone who has an actual flying helicopter uses a hack client
plane-crazy 2020-07-04 04:05:17 again, what's the hack client people use
plane-crazy 2020-07-04 04:05:09 I tried that too
plane-crazy 2020-07-04 04:04:48 it doesn't matter how many blocks I take off, it only gets worse
plane-crazy 2020-07-04 04:03:17 https://gyazo.com/83bea2e42363dba4714969ae2c23bb56
plane-crazy 2020-07-04 04:02:24 I'll make a gif
plane-crazy 2020-07-04 04:02:17 it's not easy getting the density of a player
plane-crazy 2020-07-04 04:02:02 I  tried
plane-crazy 2020-07-04 04:01:45 yes
plane-crazy 2020-07-04 04:01:30 I tried that too
plane-crazy 2020-07-04 04:00:52 that made it worse
plane-crazy 2020-07-04 04:00:11 putting propellers on the bank doesn't work
plane-crazy 2020-07-04 03:59:55 
plane-crazy 2020-07-04 03:59:20 
plane-crazy 2020-07-04 03:59:00 in a gif?
plane-crazy 2020-07-04 03:58:47 it is
plane-crazy 2020-07-04 03:58:19 why does it do flips at all
plane-crazy 2020-07-04 03:58:13 how
plane-crazy 2020-07-04 03:57:36 what hack client do you need to make a helicopter not do flips
plane-crazy 2020-07-04 03:48:35 to counter the bottom one spinning it already
plane-crazy 2020-07-04 03:48:19 the top should be twice as fast
plane-crazy 2020-07-04 03:45:57 I know, that's what I'm doing
plane-crazy 2020-07-04 03:45:26 I'm not using cheat blocks
plane-crazy 2020-07-04 03:45:19 everyone else says to add it
plane-crazy 2020-07-04 03:44:00 since you need opposing propellers (doesn't need it irl though) for flying, does the opposing propeller that lands it need to be shorter
plane-crazy 2020-07-04 03:42:53 does the opposing propeller have to be shorter than the lifting propeller?
plane-crazy 2020-07-04 03:35:14 is there a secret to making helicopters?
plane-crazy 2020-07-04 02:44:35 the man behind the slaughter
plane-crazy 2020-07-04 01:00:48 oh, I've been needing that
plane-crazy 2020-07-04 01:00:24 what's a servo
plane-crazy 2020-07-04 01:00:06 why not just keep spinning
plane-crazy 2020-07-04 00:59:57 I don't get it
plane-crazy 2020-07-04 00:59:03 what does it reset
plane-crazy 2020-07-04 00:58:33 > does anyone know what the reset option in a motor does
ðŸŒŠ
plane-crazy 2020-07-04 00:55:24 does anyone know what the reset option in a motor does
plane-crazy 2020-07-04 00:23:05 what does turning on reset for motors do
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 23:37:39 np
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 23:37:10 like this, the middle part spins while the bottom and top don't, the top needs the same stats but reversed and double the speed
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 23:36:08 1 sec
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 23:34:23 example?
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 23:06:13 there's no curved out wedge corner sadly
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 23:05:49 use normal and triangle wedges
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 23:04:39 I meant in the game
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 23:04:18 show the front
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 23:00:12 thank you
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 22:59:53 oh
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 22:41:28 what is damping
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 20:53:32 how is it not obvious when someone isn't in build mode
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 20:53:22 why do 6 year olds think they can kill me while I'm in build mode
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 18:33:49 that 1 spot you can't place anything at is so annoying
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 17:04:35 I couldn't post the link the the message, is it in logs?
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 17:00:30 thank you
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 16:57:48 for the designer rank, do you need a screenshot of block counts or just the post with votes
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 07:58:26 for the designer rank, do you need to show a black count or just a screenshot of your post with the votes
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 07:39:12 which rank
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 07:39:03 lemme join
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 07:38:52 is that a vip server

plane-crazy 2020-07-03 05:49:04 stay away from skywatcher if you have a budget
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 05:48:44 I could probably find a good cheap one
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 05:47:58 how old is he
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 05:46:45 oh, get a reflector for planets
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 05:46:38 solar filter
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 05:46:12 what do you want a telescope for
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 05:45:32 bad idea
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 05:45:08 what brand
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 05:44:50 don't buy from wish, they suck
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 05:44:32 rule 1 of buying a telescope, if it's not a scam, then you get what you pay for
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 05:41:54 I'm getting an IRL refractor soon, I only have a reflector right now
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 05:41:18 they used a real picture of the moon
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 05:41:08 what
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 05:40:51 it is the Roblox moon
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 05:39:50 this is with the lowest graphics
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 05:39:34 we can't get mirrors yet
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 05:39:29 refractor
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 05:39:11 telescope works
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 05:33:09 wings
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 05:32:40 wings
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 05:22:27 I love rockets a ton but I've never seen so many other people who also love them
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 05:22:02 what's with the major interest in rockets in this game?
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 02:15:40 lawn mower*
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 02:04:22 
plane-crazy 2020-07-02 10:48:38 yes

plane-crazy 2020-07-02 08:43:32 what does damping do to the suspension
plane-crazy 2020-07-02 04:57:40 contest?
plane-crazy 2020-07-02 04:39:55 what's that

plane-crazy 2020-07-01 23:48:59 there should be a 1 block space above the conveyor when the piston is closed
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 23:48:45 a piston need to push the conveyor under a block
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 23:45:36 train?
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 23:43:40 the conveyor engine?
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 23:36:36 perfect
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 23:34:59 do hover thrusters only raise according to the ground or can I hover off of a block
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 23:00:11 what are the settings of the motors
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 22:53:57 is power off while lock is on?
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 21:42:18 what exactly is a servo
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 21:21:31 vote kick system please
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 21:19:59 these 4 year olds are so toxic
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 21:19:43 
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 21:17:58 it takes a fraction of the rockets to lag a server
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 21:17:34 not fine at all
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 21:16:37 not rocket engines
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 21:16:21 or just the ability to client side hide the base entirely
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 21:16:00 we need a limited amount of everything to get rid of the laggers
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 04:15:34

plane-crazy 2020-06-30 23:10:57 maybe an HP computer like me
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 22:51:32 I can see that
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 22:51:12 ðŸ˜³
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 22:47:57 I do
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 22:47:30 it doesn't work for me
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 22:47:18 it doesn't
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 22:43:29 what is the weld on a magnet supposed to do
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 22:30:01 y'all like my new mech?
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 22:22:06 
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 22:21:47 
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 22:21:43 best plane I've ever seen
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 21:25:36 when you weld with a magnet, does it keep break the weld when you try to push it away
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 20:21:12 oh, wrong channel
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 17:06:06 Police: what's in your pocket?
Cartoon character: nothing

plane-crazy 2020-06-29 16:02:34 all pvp tutorial users are bad
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 10:33:58 it was the closest to the center of mass I could get
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 10:32:10 still flips
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 10:32:05 done
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 10:28:22 it flies up slowly starting to flip then stars doing more flips
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 10:26:48 I aligned them but it still just does flips
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 10:22:27 
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 10:22:11 anyone know why this keep flying backwards?
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 08:03:30 you could probably do it with a single flap
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 07:59:10 you might need those
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 07:58:35 depends on the size but if you have flaps, raise them when lifting off
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 07:57:56 yes
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 07:57:18 make it go fast
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 07:48:53 hecc
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 07:47:48 does a helicopter need opposing propellers to fly
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 05:13:39 I wanted to switch to something that would keep pushing
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 05:13:28 it's a bullet for my railgun cannon
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 05:12:58 I need this magnet to push this
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 05:12:11 yes
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 05:11:51 is there a way to make a magnet pull/push something it's anchored to?
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 03:16:56 thank you
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 03:16:51 perfect
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 03:16:04 what does turning off the powered option do? does it allow the motor to spin freely
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 02:48:42 to what
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 02:08:46 probably the speed
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 02:03:06 does super strength on a magnet give it the ability to reach behind it
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 18:29:36 these kids are pathetic
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 18:26:51 these children and their server laggers are so annoying
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 10:34:37 how is there an imbalance in something made completely symmetrical?
plane-crazy 2020-06-26 20:38:11 controlled surface propellers
plane-crazy 2020-06-26 18:20:46 if you say "learn how to build" but then immediately flex tutorial crafts, you can't build

plane-crazy 2020-06-26 05:46:18 flying cutter snakes
