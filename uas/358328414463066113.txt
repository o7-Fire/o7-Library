creations-chat 2020-07-01 16:08:53 
creations-chat 2020-07-01 16:08:54 vs shaded bow
creations-chat 2020-07-01 16:13:23 Why
creations-chat 2020-07-02 05:03:46 <@!417484722239963136> does that bruhpache have a working swashplate
creations-chat 2020-07-02 14:47:23 <@356231361344045057> did u end up finishing ur yamato in the build space
creations-chat 2020-07-02 14:47:33 Didnt look like itd fit to me
creations-chat 2020-07-02 14:47:42 I will be pleasantly surprised if u did
creations-chat 2020-07-02 15:59:18 dang teach me your ways
creations-chat 2020-07-02 15:59:20 ropes??
creations-chat 2020-07-02 15:59:26 i mean i made one that works like a real swashplate
creations-chat 2020-07-02 15:59:35 im not big brain enough to figure out a plane crazy specialized one
creations-chat 2020-07-02 16:00:00 also wouldn't be surprised if it's been done before, but has anyone seen a falcon 9 with lockmotor grid fins
creations-chat 2020-07-02 16:00:41 wait but
creations-chat 2020-07-02 16:00:44 how do the ropes actuate the blades
creations-chat 2020-07-02 16:01:18 moves swashplate as in spins it?
creations-chat 2020-07-02 16:01:25 wait the ropes get twisted?
creations-chat 2020-07-02 16:01:40 anyone have like a reference/screenshot that I can investigate/copy idk
creations-chat 2020-07-02 16:01:53 center of mass is back
creations-chat 2020-07-02 16:01:57 and having wings in the back causes drag
creations-chat 2020-07-02 16:02:06 so it'll tilt back when upward force is applied
creations-chat 2020-07-02 16:02:23 orly
creations-chat 2020-07-02 16:02:36 i heard smth about heli blades being proportional to the heli's mass or size or something
creations-chat 2020-07-02 16:02:47 idk why though
creations-chat 2020-07-02 16:08:09 <@!417484722239963136> any chance u can leek bruhpache swooshplate design? if it's ur own then nvm but if it's a common thing I'd like to see
creations-chat 2020-07-02 16:09:03 i've never seen it in person or anywhere else

creations-chat 2020-07-02 16:10:44 helium bad, heavy ballast bad
creations-chat 2020-07-02 16:10:50 just spam pontoons/lightest ballast at the waterline, on the hull sides
creations-chat 2020-07-02 18:36:24 ? what
creations-chat 2020-07-02 18:36:28 oh earlier lol
creations-chat 2020-07-02 18:44:25 why dont people just use half cylinder rollers for ez retention lol
creations-chat 2020-07-02 18:44:32 hate when they put guides on the sidess of the tracks
creations-chat 2020-07-02 18:45:15 yamato turrets, old(right) vs new(left)
creations-chat 2020-07-02 18:46:01 lockmotors are magical
creations-chat 2020-07-02 18:46:04 looks so much better
creations-chat 2020-07-02 21:40:56 anyone have a better way to make ship railings
creations-chat 2020-07-02 21:40:58 
creations-chat 2020-07-02 21:41:04 lockmotoring ladders down is SO annoying for curved parts
creations-chat 2020-07-02 21:42:57 yeah but then it just doesn't go in...
creations-chat 2020-07-02 21:42:59 
creations-chat 2020-07-02 21:43:15 guess i could use disconnectors? let the railing sink down 1 after turning the railings
creations-chat 2020-07-02 21:43:29 the motor2 is locked into the hull,, but struggles to move the railing in
creations-chat 2020-07-02 21:44:00 
creations-chat 2020-07-02 21:44:13 im trying to turn the railing in
creations-chat 2020-07-02 21:44:21 but since i sink it half a block, it collides with the hull and glitches out
creations-chat 2020-07-02 21:44:33 I think i have to turn it in, THEN lock it down?
creations-chat 2020-07-02 21:46:52 hhh bruh
creations-chat 2020-07-02 21:47:02 that could look okay but.. might miss vertical poles
creations-chat 2020-07-02 21:47:58 oh wait looks promising
creations-chat 2020-07-02 21:48:03 ww1 boats ugly smh
creations-chat 2020-07-02 21:48:46 i dont like the chonky straight hulls
creations-chat 2020-07-02 21:49:30 why not?
creations-chat 2020-07-02 21:49:32 lockmotor?
creations-chat 2020-07-02 21:50:06 
creations-chat 2020-07-02 21:50:09 wait that's pretty good lmao
creations-chat 2020-07-02 21:50:14 i welded it with maget
creations-chat 2020-07-02 21:50:27 oh that landing pad is so sick
creations-chat 2020-07-02 21:50:50 also is there a reason why everyone seems to like half wedges and such for hulls, instead of triangle wedges?
creations-chat 2020-07-02 21:51:33 cus like
creations-chat 2020-07-02 21:51:41 half wedges look kinda rough
creations-chat 2020-07-02 21:51:50 but triangle wedges r so smooth and nice
creations-chat 2020-07-02 21:51:52 
creations-chat 2020-07-02 21:52:03 if anyone has a smooth lookin half wedge hull
creations-chat 2020-07-02 21:52:04 pls send pic
creations-chat 2020-07-02 21:53:01 I just make parametric curves in solidworks or autodesk inventor, sample slopes at various points, and do the math
creations-chat 2020-07-02 21:53:18 then u know what mix of straight blocks and 1x4's to use
creations-chat 2020-07-02 21:53:31 cus like if uw ant a slope of 1/9 its a 1x4 with 5 striaght blocks around it right
creations-chat 2020-07-02 21:53:39 how else do ppl do hulls
creations-chat 2020-07-02 21:54:00 fair point
creations-chat 2020-07-02 21:54:09 im more of an artist than engineer so...

creations-chat 2020-07-02 22:13:38 so what else lol
creations-chat 2020-07-02 22:14:03 also what's the benefit of this hull technique? I see it so often but never figured out why
creations-chat 2020-07-02 22:15:46 it's harder to build, looks worse(imo), more blocks...
creations-chat 2020-07-02 22:15:51 does it float better or something?
creations-chat 2020-07-02 22:16:01 not roasting the build, just curious why EVERY other nice ship I've seen does this
creations-chat 2020-07-02 22:16:33 why not use wedges to round out the edges of that
creations-chat 2020-07-02 22:16:41 yeah
creations-chat 2020-07-02 22:17:08 its really nice, u use a reference?

bug-reports 2020-07-03 02:34:50 
bug-reports 2020-07-03 02:35:01 anchors are with physics off
bug-reports 2020-07-03 02:35:08 motors with lock on do not move any blocks
bug-reports 2020-07-03 02:35:13 but rotate if unloaded
bug-reports 2020-07-03 02:35:18 is this a bug or intentional?
creations-chat 2020-07-03 03:03:44 bob ross bruh
creations-chat 2020-07-03 03:03:52 that's gotta be near 10k blocks for final right
creations-chat 2020-07-03 03:04:08 100x100 is pretty crazy on data
creations-chat 2020-07-03 03:13:10 oh please no
creations-chat 2020-07-03 03:13:12 just use motors
creations-chat 2020-07-03 03:13:23 oh nvm u used linear actuators... have fun
creations-chat 2020-07-03 03:43:40 I thought of making a nebulon, realized it could look awesome cus it's spindly and can fold pretty hard
creations-chat 2020-07-03 03:45:03 then I made a 5-plot-wide snoke ship thing instead
creations-chat 2020-07-03 15:12:25 
creations-chat 2020-07-03 15:12:29 ship deck starting to get out of hand
creations-chat 2020-07-03 15:12:46

creations-chat 2020-07-03 16:32:58 wait yeah u can put a block there and still have it work
creations-chat 2020-07-03 16:33:12 i also am very uncomfortable with the idea of a 1 wide bow tip

creations-chat 2020-07-04 17:42:30 <@505835349889777685> saw a glimpse of it in a screenshot and am interested
creations-chat 2020-07-04 17:43:42 <@419477639229865984>  Nice banshee! It looks amazing, hows it fly

creations-chat 2020-07-05 00:07:19 <@!422194096258547733> why not ladder railings?
creations-chat 2020-07-05 00:07:53 
creations-chat 2020-07-05 00:07:54 oh

creations-chat 2020-07-05 00:08:06 is it pvp oriented im guessing
creations-chat 2020-07-05 00:08:21 ah so it can dogfight
creations-chat 2020-07-05 00:12:14 <@!422194096258547733> if it looks trash (as it did on my yama) sink it half a block and it might look nice( as it did)
creations-chat 2020-07-05 00:12:33 bepis truck on a jump
creations-chat 2020-07-05 16:29:39 <@!316693531638890497> no turret elevate?
creations-chat 2020-07-05 16:31:17 also not sure im a fan of the material :/
creations-chat 2020-07-05 16:32:17 i use default just cus it's smooth like actual metal
creations-chat 2020-07-05 16:32:20 things would change if u did camo though
creations-chat 2020-07-05 16:32:28 I'm doing yamato which doesn't have a camo, so default for me :>
creations-chat 2020-07-05 16:33:07 yeah then just
creations-chat 2020-07-05 16:33:08 paint it
creations-chat 2020-07-05 16:33:38 
creations-chat 2020-07-05 16:33:42 u see the uh
creations-chat 2020-07-05 16:33:51 
creations-chat 2020-07-05 16:33:53 those areas are painted lighter gray
creations-chat 2020-07-05 16:34:05 to make the angled corners more clear
creations-chat 2020-07-05 16:34:44 I find it too dull/flat when a turret is painted all 1 color
creations-chat 2020-07-05 16:35:14 color shading also takes hulls
creations-chat 2020-07-05 16:35:15 to the next level

creations-chat 2020-08-10 04:07:08 <@!587047177558163466> I wanted something of size usable for like a rock crawler build. That mecanum chassis actually works ok on hills, strafes straight, but is kinda bumpy on road even with suspension. Getting a remotely circular overall profile was tough... 8 rollers is probably doable with 2x2 2s, but really hard to get on my scale
creations-chat 2020-08-10 04:07:45 
creations-chat 2020-08-10 04:07:48 8 roller thats really small
creations-chat 2020-08-10 04:08:04 HELLA smooth moving and strafing, but since the roller axis isn't aligned properly, the thing slips in all directions which sucks
creations-chat 2020-08-10 04:08:08 also wheels mega wide
