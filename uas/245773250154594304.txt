help 2020-04-17 10:25:25 Hey Iâ€™m new to plane crazy. I saw this guy who made a gun and it seemed to track to where his mouse was pointing? Is this possible and how? (Please @ me or do me thanks)
help 2020-04-17 10:27:18 What settings am I supposed to check for this to work?
help 2020-04-17 10:27:25 In config
help 2020-04-17 10:28:11 I know but by default does it track mouse or do I have to press that screwdriver thing and configure the properties?
