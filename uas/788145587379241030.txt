creations-chat 2021-12-09 01:22:02 dude Rocket engines or Hover engines make it more realistic in terms of movement
creations-chat 2021-12-09 01:25:01 So you mean, you want me to switch it to regular motors? Like, no Super Rocket engines or Hover engines?
creations-chat 2021-12-09 01:27:23 Alright, I'll upload that tomorrow.
creations-chat 2021-12-09 01:29:47 Alright.

creations-chat 2021-12-09 01:52:34 <@!529111635844136971> Alright man, I'll be reposting it with no shaders and some fixes on the Blackhawk
creations-chat 2021-12-09 01:58:57 Ok, there it is.
creations-chat 2021-12-09 02:01:54 Thanks
creations-chat 2021-12-09 02:17:57 I'm surprised that most of the downvotes on the last post were because of the rotors
creations-chat 2021-12-09 02:21:56 it flies smoothly, tho it took awhile
creations-chat 2021-12-09 02:25:08 <@!746908991434784798>  Any suggestions on what to improve? It's not oversized, it's ro-scale. The screens I took make it look big
creations-chat 2021-12-09 02:34:08 Uhh 4 cuz of half blocks
creations-chat 2021-12-09 02:42:54 xd
creations-chat 2021-12-09 04:24:01 No, its not thicc, I compared it on the 3d
creations-chat 2021-12-09 05:04:54 Shredder xd
creations-chat 2021-12-09 05:11:34 Why does it feel like I got pinged?
creations-chat 2021-12-09 05:19:23 Uhh you sure? The nose part is what makes this heli look good (to me)
creations-chat 2021-12-09 05:24:05 Alright
creations-chat 2021-12-09 18:27:15 yes
creations-chat 2021-12-09 18:30:46 ok
creations-chat 2021-12-16 20:07:44 <@!620688670105534476> F-22 Looks good, The nose ruined it for me.
creations-chat 2021-12-16 20:14:36 Uhhh do you have the image? Cause I'd like to see.
creations-chat 2021-12-16 20:18:59 Hmmm, nothings showing for me rip
creations-chat 2021-12-16 20:27:28 Feedback on this F-22, does it look too shitty? If it does, I'll continue remaking it, if not. Please tell me what could use Improvements.
creations-chat 2021-12-16 20:30:59 Here is more angles of the jet I need more feedback on what to improve or should I just remake it?
creations-chat 2021-12-16 20:34:53 cuz jet is big and yes <@!251880826386513924> , more payload xd
creations-chat 2021-12-16 20:42:16 Are my wings hella shit too? xd
creations-chat 2021-12-16 20:49:19 I guess I can agree with that xd Especially the expose lock. Maybe I'll just remake the whole damn jet xd. <@456226577798135808>  Canopy is fix but who cares? as the whole jet is getting a remake xd (apart from nose)
creations-chat 2021-12-16 20:51:49 also uhh expect why this is bad is cuz this was like 4 or 6 months ago
creations-chat 2022-01-11 00:34:45 <@!843374289876680725> that jet looks bad,  I remember you calling my Blackhawk a tutorial and saying " I build better than you" lmao stupid kid
help 2022-08-21 23:30:41 Anybody here know how to fix this gap when you use angle locking?
help 2022-08-21 23:32:23 alright...
