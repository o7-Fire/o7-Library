creations-chat 2021-05-11 23:46:24 yeah thats how shells bounce off tank armour
creations-chat 2021-05-12 00:05:51 -9 upvotes, yeah thats about what i expected
creations-chat 2021-05-12 04:32:24 i'd like to make a shoutout to the 2 people that upvoted my ship
creations-chat 2021-05-13 16:27:49 if you think your build is bad, wait until peopel see my record of uploads in creations
creations-chat 2021-05-13 16:30:10 btw, this is how el zapato looks like underwater, simple water wheel (which sucks tbh) and a rutter
creations-chat 2021-05-13 16:32:17 plus, i know most ""criticism"" here is just hate talk, but there are a few people who give genuine opinions about your build, so dont throw them all off as "bad" or "hate"
creations-chat 2021-05-13 16:35:53 yes, but it makes the thing bulkier and bigger
creations-chat 2021-05-13 16:37:55 dont take <#384025409945337856> seriously, someone got 400 upvotes by uploading a single block
creations-chat 2021-05-13 16:42:47 can i say i really like ironclads, they are cool and not as popular as galleys or wooden ships or destroyers and stuff, they were like the stepping stone into the modern era for naval development and they are ignored
creations-chat 2021-05-13 16:44:49 i agree with this person
creations-chat 2021-05-13 16:50:19 im putting this in the "pcc cringe compilation folder"

creations-chat 2021-05-16 15:21:08 ...that's how the original tordbot looked like, also, i think his username is epic, also also you shouldn't criticize someone for their gamer tag, also also also people who use the word cringe in 2021 are not epic
creations-chat 2021-05-16 15:23:18 this is literally <#504436696021204992> , we get hate talk all the time and we never ask for it, and yet we get it🤡

creations-chat 2021-06-09 02:27:27 actual criticism: the design kinda looks like a cybertruck kinda vehicle, blocky and all, i like it, the wheels are okay, but not spectacular, it is a truck with a gun, you did pretty good

creations-chat 2021-06-10 21:48:02 <#504436696021204992> is becoming such a joke that people are now taking it as a joke
creations-chat 2021-06-11 13:50:30 <@!592619320421384232> damn, impressive, i like this chess trend that im seeing here in pcc, if they actually move around without having to push them im gonna be impressed even more
creations-chat 2021-06-11 14:59:05 tips for <#384025409945337856> 
1. dont make anything that flies, that's the area with the most competition and good builds
2. make something creative that is unique enough to stand out of most builds
3. focus mostly on design, then make the thing actually work, or even better, make something that doesnt have mechanical function and is just design based
4. if you are doing any kind of vehicle, motorlocking is kinda a must, but you need to really get the feel of it to use it properly (i cant motorlock well lmao)
5. if you have any exposed motor locks, you will be executed
6. funni = more upvotes
creations-chat 2021-06-11 15:04:17 <@!380926327210901506> what do you think of my 5 tips for creations

creations-chat 2021-07-22 14:01:30 honestly we should stop taking ranks and <#384025409945337856> seriously, just talk about your idea or ask for help in <#478584971670454284> or <#384021699466756107>
creations-chat 2021-07-22 14:06:19 yes, virtual stuff has an effect on people, surprisingly aint it
creations-chat 2021-07-22 14:10:03 conclusion, fuck creations, all my homies hate creations, just make something that makes your creativity flow, that was the point of creations, to show what you have created
creations-chat 2021-07-22 14:14:13 i think the reason builds like those are upvoted are due to the creativity behind it, rarely do we see an example of people liking a build not for the details, exposed motorlocks and personal views, but rather due to the nice and cool gesture behind the idea of replicating the save slot of the game in the game
creations-chat 2021-07-22 14:18:14 yes that describes basically the average <#384025409945337856> build-hater™️
