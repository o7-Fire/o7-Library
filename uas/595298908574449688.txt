creations-chat 2021-05-06 03:36:56 with Minecraft, you physically cant put that much detail in so you just dont try.
the-dump 2021-05-06 03:48:55 is it?
the-dump 2021-05-06 03:50:44 thought so lol
the-dump 2021-05-06 03:51:45 bruh after all that all you care about is the engine? makes sense.
the-dump 2021-05-06 03:53:23 So its killing everyone around you and youre just sitting back and watching it burn?
the-dump 2021-05-07 17:08:13 i just throw it at the sun for a few secs, works every time

creations-chat 2021-07-12 16:07:22 i posted something not bad and its got 6 and 4-
creations-chat 2021-07-12 16:09:56 foil just seemed nice and its lighter then normal blocks so i can use less thrust and helium. and okay
creations-chat 2021-07-12 16:12:32 i thought default was the heaviest?
creations-chat 2021-07-12 16:35:06 yes thats what blimps are XD and we dont have 20 block wide curves so it has to be like that
creations-chat 2021-07-12 16:39:40 yeah ik, that was 80% for colour coding when i was making it, i messed up each secion cuz i had no idea what it was so they are like gridlines.
creations-chat 2021-07-12 16:42:05 still better then the white rods with engines that have 8 blocks that i see lol
creations-chat 2021-07-12 16:44:09 most "rockets" i see are 3x3 cylinders with an engine on the bottom so thats at least a step up from that
help 2021-07-16 03:58:21 if you look closely you can see the texture of the metal too, the streaks in it are about 0.2-ish blocks long on a block, moterlock dosnt make things smaller then itself so it's not possible
creations-chat 2021-07-16 04:00:38 I doubt a lot of people could do better anyways, making the nose slightly smaller would make it nearly perfect
creations-chat 2021-07-21 22:31:27 ok
the-dump 2021-08-02 03:44:59 whats happening
the-dump 2021-08-02 03:45:19 bruh
the-dump 2021-08-02 03:46:04 ya done?
the-dump 2021-08-02 03:50:22 i wonder if Unbreakable is sending messages too quickly
the-dump 2021-08-02 03:50:42 its possible
creations-chat 2021-08-11 20:02:39 ty m8
creations-chat 2021-08-12 08:14:41 if I knew what that tanks name was ahead of time I would have guessed it, that makes it an automatic 7+ / 10
creations-chat 2021-08-12 08:22:11 you were just as good as that starting out, given time and practice it'll get better.
creations-chat 2021-08-17 05:32:07 that used to be what id do to get a basic frame of reference, like "ok this is remotely the size I want" and then work from there so if that's like very early in building and just wanted to share progress it's not bad. If that's the real deal then I have no comment-
creations-chat 2021-08-20 05:07:58 most people don't know how to moterlock, but it could be smoothed out a little and more narrow with the body.
creations-chat 2021-08-20 05:11:11 without a video tutorial or someone else showing you, you'll never see it and it's extremely difficult to figure it out on your own.
creations-chat 2021-08-20 05:17:17 Moterlocking is good and useful but it's not essential most of the time
creations-chat 2021-08-20 05:25:39 nobody here ever takes into account the skill level here, not everybody can or even feels like spending weeks on some ridiculous build making it absolutely perfect, they just wanna have a fun, I guarantee he didn't care at all about your personal opinions about it. At this point the "feedback" is 90% "you're shit, get good"
creations-chat 2021-08-20 05:29:59 people here just don't accept that you don't start off knowing every single thing ever in this game, they just downvote because it's not HallOfFame worthy.
creations-chat 2021-08-20 05:33:03 it's not feedback, it's usually "that's shit, redo it"
creations-chat 2021-08-20 05:36:00 I have never gotten more then 50 upvotes on anything under 5000 blocks ever.
creations-chat 2021-08-21 03:53:47 am I the only one who is wondering why the image has little cuts on each side? from top to bottom on both sides-
creations-chat 2021-08-21 03:56:04 there are like 20 little breaks dipping in, it could just be the angle
creations-chat 2021-08-21 03:59:11 they aren't as defined in the border though, plus the top is wider than the bottom... and that's either black or just a missing block in the bottom left corner lol. There is also a thing in the top right that's like 0.2 blocks out XD
creations-chat 2021-08-21 04:06:29 Because unless you moterlocked it there are things you couldn't have done
creations-chat 2021-08-21 04:10:30 even with the low quality, the cutting on the edges is bigger than the blocks in the image, the top is wider than the build plot but that could be just from perspective, there is a tiny hole in the bottom left, a tiny bump in the top right and under the mouth on the left side there is just a collection of pixels that don't belong, it could all just be nothing but it's just things I've noticed.
creations-chat 2021-08-21 04:24:29 a lot of things today have been pretty average from what you see in-game, this server just sets really high standards
creations-chat 2021-08-21 04:27:59 usually in a server of 8, about 3 are decent (knows moterlock and the custom engines), 4 have no idea what they are doing and 1 is really good, today have been a mix of the good 3 and the bad 4.
creations-chat 2021-08-21 04:30:38 some are better than others, I've been in one where I was the only person to be past the tutorial, and others all 8 players are very good.
creations-chat 2021-08-21 04:33:01 same here, I firend others that are on ly level and play with them
creations-chat 2021-08-21 04:42:01 *inhales* d o e s i t w o r k ?
creations-chat 2021-08-21 04:46:14 does the runway work? if not it's not fantastic
creations-chat 2021-08-21 04:49:26 you would be amazed at how many platforms/carriers/runways in this game have random posts and hidden cameras and overall obstacles that make it unusable, more often than not they don't work
creations-chat 2021-08-21 04:52:54 again more often than not, you land on stuff and you just smash into a beam, it's not a stupid question given the game lol
creations-chat 2021-08-21 04:56:34 yes that, it's part of the construction and almost always gets in the way, even my own carrier has them just to hold itself together and I made them tall to mess with people, most are smaller but some are big and get in the way
creations-chat 2021-08-21 04:59:17 I have no doubt the one we're talking about works perfectly, just that many others don't, a suprizing amount given that it's such a simple problem that dosnt even need to happen.
creations-chat 2021-08-21 05:19:54 I have no idea what that is from that angle- can't give feedback if idk what om feeding back
creations-chat 2021-08-21 05:23:02 yes much better, overall it's *a car*, the edges could use a little smoothing out but other than that its not bad
creations-chat 2021-08-21 05:59:52 it's good, but HOF (hall of fame) is simply extremely good
creations-chat 2021-08-21 06:02:58 if it was that exact same thing but way bigger and a lot more detail you might have a chance, take what you've already done and make it next level and you'd have a shot.
creations-chat 2021-08-21 06:14:42 if the heli can fly then it's a heli- make it smooth all around and colour it, then it'll be acceptable
creations-chat 2021-08-21 06:17:36 so that's assuming it can fly, so just make it less blocky, that's not a difficult fix, a few wedges should do it.
creations-chat 2021-08-21 06:39:40 simple fix
bot-central 2021-08-21 06:43:33 !rank
creations-chat 2021-08-21 07:39:46 dark
creations-chat 2021-08-23 16:00:40 I feel like people rarely upvote because they like the way things look or work, they just upvote because they like what it's based off or whatever which is why very few custom builds get upvotes
creations-chat 2021-08-27 00:22:15 haha die fire
creations-chat 2021-09-08 02:29:39 the back looks not bad, Idk what's going on in the front though lol
If you are gonna add a hood to it then it would make it automatically a lot better, it seems like it's not done which is fine but that *can* be really good if you just cover it up
creations-chat 2021-09-08 02:38:35 np
creations-chat 2021-11-30 03:08:16 There is absolutely 0 questioning what it is, so it's automatically pretty good.
If you'd want to improve it, if possible try to beef up the legs a little.
creations-chat 2021-11-30 03:51:45 hey uhh I think there is a plane behind your random assortment of pics that server no purpose
creations-chat 2021-11-30 04:01:35 it's positive if your sense is high enough to understand things that don't make sense
creations-chat 2021-11-30 04:04:17 am i? or are *you* the stupid for not getting it?
creations-chat 2021-11-30 04:07:23 school took it, sorry
creations-chat 2021-11-30 04:10:29 I was for a time until I got kicked out so I said I'm dropping out XD
creations-chat 2021-11-30 04:14:05 don't blow up classrooms

oh yes it was education, my science project was making black powder and someone had a lighter XDDD
creations-chat 2021-11-30 04:16:51 17...

that was the last time that science teacher let everyone do what they wanted without running it by her XD
creations-chat 2021-11-30 04:20:38 fresh
creations-chat 2021-11-30 04:28:40 balloons with engines
creations-chat 2021-11-30 04:31:53 balloons with balloon engines

creations-chat 2021-12-26 03:05:22 anti T-bone tactic, never got sideswiped again
bot-central 2022-02-19 23:57:14 !rank
the-dump 2022-02-19 23:57:38 yes
creations-chat 2022-02-28 04:12:49 that is either 12000 blocks extremely well moterlocked in which case it's awesome, or it's a normal block, I'm really not sure XD
that could honestly be the best thing I've ever seen
creations-chat 2022-02-28 04:15:31 I don't think I've ever said anything that didn't get at least 1 person being toxic about it lol
creations-chat 2022-02-28 04:19:37 what if that is indeed very advanced moterlocking and it would have taken a long time? now you're the idiot
creations-chat 2022-02-28 04:23:42 mhm...
it really wouldn't have mattered what you posted, you would have gotten a similar reaction
creations-chat 2022-02-28 04:31:10 legit just a 1x1 and 5 people lost thier mind
considering it's a b l o c k
creations-chat 2022-02-28 04:34:37 likely the NO Toxicity part
creations-chat 2022-02-28 04:37:46 y u s ?
I don't think you can, you could moterlock it into thr base of a disconnecor, that'll hide it
creations-chat 2022-02-28 04:40:34 being 100% honest, I don't think he's a pro and I also think he really dosnt care, you were that good when you started too, everyone was
creations-chat 2022-02-28 04:43:58 the standard here are way higher then the quality of people setting them
ok that is fair XD
creations-chat 2022-02-28 04:48:42 not because it's litetaly not thire IP? XD
creations-chat 2022-02-28 04:50:47 you are allowed but it's against the rules
creations-chat 2022-03-14 03:36:27 just shorten the gear by 1 block and flatten the front by 1 block, that'll make it wayyy cleaner
noice
creations-chat 2022-03-14 03:40:21 it's Plane Crazy where the standard building block is 1 meter³, you can put the wings on the inside and things will still fly, airflow is irrelevant
creations-chat 2022-04-01 15:58:51 yes
