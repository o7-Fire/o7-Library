[Title] - Floating Islands
[Catagory] - Gameplay
[Description] - A large array of floating islands that have holes and gaps in/inbetween them, sort of like the ones in War Thunder's April Fool's 2021 event or the movie Avatar.

creations-chat 2021-11-21 21:17:30 you arent funny
help 2021-11-25 00:30:59 What I typically do for a wide craft like that is put wing panels in the edges, just so it doesnt tip as much and so handling is smoother

creations-chat 2021-12-07 22:33:48 If creations_feedback was twitter, this whole server would've been abandoned by now
Infographic is just a bad source also. Its like trying to use tiktok as a reliable source
creations-chat 2021-12-07 22:37:17 Dont forget the part where the entire country essentially becomes one massive minefield
creations-chat 2021-12-14 20:48:27 Looks like the painter accidentally dropped the dye on his armor and they just went with it
Also lacks the visual imperfections with the armor that are usually there

creations-chat 2022-02-02 20:08:17 I think it started with someone posting a glass heavy motorlock something to flex the lock, then it exploded in everyone's face
creations-chat 2022-02-09 07:01:53 <@268862168877760512> personal opinion on the screenshots - try not to zoom out to the point where one needs a microscope to see the content properly
creations-chat 2022-02-09 07:05:20 Yeah it seems proportional after looking at the wheels and counting blocks
creations-chat 2022-02-12 15:39:08 Bruh it came on right after I sent my upvote sign

creations-chat 2023-05-15 17:37:14 Mfw I slap a shitty turret onto a recent hull and get a 35:1 ratio:
*Edit I did my math wrong lmao
It's actually 52:1 when getting rid of the hyperbot default upvote/downvote
creations-chat 2023-05-15 17:47:20 I just went back and grabbed a random one
(This isnt mine)
creations-chat 2023-05-15 18:32:32 Barrel is excessively long but other that that it's fine

Barrel length should be roughly 2.5 times the turret length (take the length of the turret, multiply it by 2.5, and that's how long the barrel should be)
