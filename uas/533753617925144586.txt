creations-chat 2020-08-23 00:57:36 So is it possible to make elevons controlled by mouse or do i have to assign roll and pitch to WASD?
creations-chat 2020-08-23 00:58:36 Thats cringe :(
creations-chat 2020-08-23 00:59:41 Well, i could just separate them, but i was thinking something like how the F18 works how the Ailerons and elevators work together to roll

bug-reports 2020-09-04 15:58:08 Why does that happen? It doesnâ€™t annoy me as much since i can still keep up with my opponents good but it annoys me when I see a small landing gear flying around after i shoot it doen
bug-reports 2020-09-04 16:14:09 When you shoot something and the parts stay behind but the player is still flying around
bug-reports 2020-09-04 16:14:43 So you only see a block or two flying around while the fuselage/Chassis stays behind

help 2020-12-16 19:16:01 stupid discord
help 2020-12-16 19:16:19 The problem is when i aim its always too sensitive no matter how low i put mac angle
help 2020-12-16 19:16:46 And i just cant aim directly onto what i want too
help 2020-12-16 19:17:30 i greatly prefer control surfaces since i can aim with better precision but motorized gives a huge upper hand, plus looks better.

help 2020-12-24 00:55:31 rotors produce lift
help 2020-12-24 00:55:41 and torque get counteracted by spinny spin
help 2020-12-24 00:56:08 Actually the reason why is because they fly because it has oil and the air has water vapor
help 2020-12-24 00:56:25 governments are lying
