creations-chat 2021-09-23 00:39:42 That looks like a Berkshire, your missing the steam dome on the boiler.
creations-chat 2021-09-23 23:42:08 I guess the wing flaps stand out
the-dump 2021-10-16 00:52:54 No
the-dump 2021-10-16 00:53:34 CSX D&S Subdivision line 3
the-dump 2021-10-16 00:54:15 BOY
the-dump 2021-10-16 00:54:25 British locomotives look bad
the-dump 2021-10-16 00:54:47 Steam locomotives would differ a lot
the-dump 2021-10-16 00:55:12 Are you a railfan too?
the-dump 2021-10-16 00:55:55 I’m talking in two chats…
the-dump 2021-10-16 00:56:09 Railfanning is fun
the-dump 2021-10-16 00:56:47 I’m building a T1 duplex in plane crazy
the-dump 2021-10-16 00:57:09 I don’t got the permission to show
the-dump 2021-10-16 00:57:47 Currently I’m burning out my brain cells making the motor locked chassis
the-dump 2021-10-16 00:59:01 God it’s a box
the-dump 2021-10-16 00:59:39 Yeah I don’t have any diesels or electric
the-dump 2021-10-16 01:00:15 That looks like a 3rd rail electric
the-dump 2021-10-16 01:00:21 Yes steam
the-dump 2021-10-16 01:00:46 I got a mini 611 and a massive 844
the-dump 2021-10-16 01:01:13 Where’s the locomotive
the-dump 2021-10-16 01:02:11 So is it the locomotive or railcar?
the-dump 2021-10-16 01:02:25 Then it’s electric
the-dump 2021-10-16 01:03:19 Diesel electric has to have a massive v-16 engine
the-dump 2021-10-16 01:03:27 And the generator
the-dump 2021-10-16 01:04:27 What
the-dump 2021-10-16 01:04:55 Oh so it’s a diesel mechanical?
the-dump 2021-10-16 01:05:56 If it doesn’t need to pull heavy loads then it’s just diesel mechanical
the-dump 2021-10-16 01:06:29 The combustion engine in diesel mechanics directly spins the axles
the-dump 2021-10-16 01:07:52 Are they all box?
the-dump 2021-10-16 01:09:00 BOX
the-dump 2021-10-16 01:09:29 That looks like diesel electric
the-dump 2021-10-16 01:10:07 It’s big and has a radiator
the-dump 2021-10-16 01:12:03 That the definition of box
the-dump 2021-10-16 01:14:03 B o x
the-dump 2021-10-16 01:15:01 So is it a military vessel?
the-dump 2021-10-16 01:16:15 Class 70 looks more normal
the-dump 2021-10-16 01:17:12 The second locomotive part reminds me of the second car of a f7
