creations-chat 2021-11-13 07:02:31 Yeah i have been deciding, either go with the tan color like the one in pf, or stick with black
creations-chat 2021-11-13 08:06:38 That's alot of buttons <:how:886142285744599080>
creations-chat 2021-11-18 00:59:59 The iron cross looking button?
creations-chat 2021-11-18 08:03:35 If it's garbage then why is it going to remain in service untill 2040, just because it's overrated it ain't bad
creations-chat 2021-11-18 08:08:26 If the A-10 is really as bad as you're saying it is, why did the US air force make a lot of variants of it, why are there over 300+ of it in service, and why from the past decades only seven warthogs have been shot down,
creations-chat 2021-11-18 08:13:22 Yes i am a military nerd and i am proud of it, also yes the rounds it carries can fuck a tank in a short burst
creations-chat 2021-11-18 08:16:15 Do you see how big this shit is?, the armor-piercing round can penetrate armor of up to 69mm thickness. At 4,000 ft range
creations-chat 2021-11-18 08:18:24 Youve seen a real one?, God damn I've only seen the spitfire in person
creations-chat 2021-11-18 08:21:35 I've only seen tanks from the cold war, not everything but most of them, also it's really annoying how this channel has 2 minutes slow mode
creations-chat 2021-11-18 08:23:57 Alright I'm out of here imma go think of something else to build or play a different game for once
creations-chat 2021-11-18 08:29:08 I live below a flight path of nearby airports i hear airliners, helicopters 24/7
creations-chat 2021-11-18 08:32:18 Funny story about the F-35 "Lightning", it was struck by lightning in flight and needed to land, it landed safely but the damage done by the lightning was so bad it's highly unlikely it's gonna survive another flight
creations-chat 2021-11-18 08:36:47 I wonder where that lightning part of the name came from
creations-chat 2021-11-18 08:41:36 Ohhhh ok makes sense now kinda
creations-chat 2021-11-18 23:36:44 I like how people can just build good looking stuff and it doesn't need to work just for upvotes

creations-chat 2021-11-23 01:04:14 When build so bad bot didn't add upvote emoji
creations-chat 2021-11-23 01:06:18 I don't?
creations-chat 2021-11-23 01:08:57 I see, well it's probably unnecessary because of how bad i built it
creations-chat 2021-11-23 01:10:59 It really isn't there's just similarities, you know what fine delete for fucks sake
creations-chat 2021-11-23 01:19:46 It's a two seater, and the back is very different from his, and idk if his is a two seater also i have no idea i didn't watch it, plus i know building tutorials is wrong so why would I break it, i am willing to give every proof to prove this is not a tutorial and its just an accident that it looked the same, i will even send a full video of a me building it from scratch
creations-chat 2021-11-23 01:34:57 What's wrong with the nose do i need to remove it because it looks similar to someone's build, i might not be a tryhard builder at this game who builds shit with motorlocking or somethubg like that, but i would never build tutorials because i know i can build stuff alone now, and this is the 3d model i copied does that count as a tutorial?
creations-chat 2021-11-23 01:38:00 What can't i change the fucking color is that illegal to do?, I didn't like the color of the model so i changed it did i break a rule from doing that?
creations-chat 2021-11-23 01:42:54 I wasted 2 fucking days to be called a tutorial, fucking cool dude just fucking cool
creations-chat 2021-11-23 01:46:27 Here full brightness and enhanced you happy now?, I have dark theme on my whole phone on which makes everything slightly darker
creations-chat 2021-11-23 02:04:59 I made a video to prove i am innocent here
creations-chat 2021-11-23 02:07:33 
creations-chat 2021-11-23 02:09:48 Thanks but i need to get that warn removed from me
creations-chat 2021-11-23 02:18:37 It really is not there's just fucking similarities, this is the model i copied
creations-chat 2021-11-23 02:22:45 So what if the nose looks simiral did i commit a war crime when it looked similar?
creations-chat 2021-11-23 13:04:26 My first motorlock build, wip still, also can someone give me the RGB codes for the camo of the Felon, the pixel camo one because i don't know how to do that, thanks in advance
creations-chat 2021-11-23 13:10:42 Thanks mate
creations-chat 2021-11-23 13:16:08 Yeah looks fine to me
creations-chat 2021-11-23 13:21:48 I know the model i used told me that they are connected but i don't know how the flaps will move if i do that
creations-chat 2021-11-23 13:23:52 Oh no, the account is hacked and is trying to do the funny someone call a mod, <:nooo:787097964946259978>
creations-chat 2021-11-24 01:49:49 I am trying to figure out how I'm not really a motorlock genius here i just learned how to do those like 2 days ago

creations-chat 2021-12-02 10:16:25 That cargo plane looks like the one in GTA V
creations-chat 2021-12-02 23:32:05 Another day another drama, classic pcc
creations-chat 2021-12-02 23:37:13 I was about to compliment this guy but he's just fueling this drama more
creations-chat 2021-12-02 23:43:25 "Historically accurate" <:XD:859859653454069831>
creations-chat 2021-12-02 23:45:27 Historically accurate like how there can be 5 maus tanks per team and how planes can fly without wings <:KEKW:670310537300672528> <:KEKW:670310537300672528>
creations-chat 2021-12-02 23:47:42 That shit was so funny you should be a clown for 8 year old birth day parties those jobs pay good
creations-chat 2021-12-02 23:49:50 If you seriously think you can turn the table over then please get professional help you might have brain damage
creations-chat 2021-12-02 23:51:58 Cry about what?, Your stupidity?, Yeah I'm trying to feel pity for you dude
creations-chat 2021-12-02 23:54:34 
creations-chat 2021-12-02 23:58:19 Mate the guy literally told you what you can do to improve the build and you just started saying insults randomly how are we in the wrong here, instead of complaining you should just thank the lad
creations-chat 2021-12-03 00:02:07 We should just ignore the lad we ain't gaining anything from this drama, if he does not like the criticism. Then we can't do shit, also <@730843316580646963> really nice house gives me horror house vibes kinda thing
creations-chat 2021-12-03 00:04:32 Stop, don't fuel the drama further
creations-chat 2021-12-03 00:06:34 <:JoeCool:887474692817047582>
creations-chat 2021-12-03 00:09:00 "well, the moment has passed"
creations-chat 2021-12-03 07:50:21 Camo should do the trick

creations-chat 2021-12-08 04:11:12 <@852906455353786418> how many fps are you getting while running that thing in your mobile device with full graphics also
creations-chat 2021-12-08 04:13:26 I can see the mountain located at the edge of the map while being at the water how is it not full graphics
creations-chat 2021-12-08 04:15:30 That is a strong ass phone, my USS Missouri is around 4k parts and i can run it below 10 fps on my phone
creations-chat 2021-12-08 05:32:36 I like how when a channel is not organized properly it becomes a major problem in here

creations-chat 2021-12-20 01:04:12 Same gun, different design
creations-chat 2021-12-20 01:17:06 First time I've ever seen the community upvote a build not because it looks good but because it's wholesome, usually it's "exposed Motorlock, bad, downvote, need more detail, shouldn't have posted <:Downvote:490311668556103700>"
creations-chat 2021-12-22 23:17:56 That don't look like a phantom at all
creations-chat 2021-12-22 23:25:05 Way worse my ass
creations-chat 2021-12-22 23:28:17 We just saying you should improve your build and now you calling our builds shit
