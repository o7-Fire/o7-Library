bug-reports 2021-10-29 01:10:01 ey
bug-reports 2021-10-29 01:10:06 I got bug
bug-reports 2021-10-29 01:10:45 my builds with hover engines just started doin this my good builds are completely out of commission now
bug-reports 2021-10-29 01:11:46 asked players about it in <#384021699466756107> and several people reported experiencing the same thing
bug-reports 2021-10-29 01:12:24 all physics cease to function (except trails still make the trail) and the build goes willy wonko across the map
bug-reports 2021-10-29 01:14:36 it aint about turning
bug-reports 2021-10-29 01:14:46 you can kill a fast turning jet if its'' top speed is 200
bug-reports 2021-10-29 01:16:18 it's the combination of fast turning, 800+ speed, and all 12 rockets
bug-reports 2021-10-29 01:16:59 also who r u
bug-reports 2021-10-29 01:17:10 how do you know me
bug-reports 2021-10-29 01:19:22 but also I actually want devs to see that bug
bug-reports 2021-10-29 01:19:42 cuz it's serious
bug-reports 2021-11-03 00:05:19 if someone dont at least see this bug this time I swear to god so many of my builds dont work anymore cuz of the new motor2 hover drive bug
bug-reports 2021-11-03 00:06:01 after the stutter total loss of physics and control
bug-reports 2021-11-03 00:06:33 getting out and getting back in does not solve the issue
bug-reports 2021-11-03 00:07:10 3 of my best ships and a helicopter I have no longer function for more than a minute within spawning
bug-reports 2021-11-03 00:07:33 ree
bug-reports 2021-11-03 00:07:56 the only use for this is teleportation but I did testing and there's no way to control when it happens
bug-reports 2021-11-03 00:08:00 and it kills your build
bug-reports 2021-11-03 00:08:48 <@!217336009455566848>  if you fix this bug I will donate all my roux
bug-reports 2021-11-03 00:08:51 no cap
bug-reports 2021-11-03 00:09:13 I mean I dont have much left but I will donate it all
bug-reports 2021-11-03 00:13:43 fr tho if that bug doesnt get fixed my best bilds are gon be broken foreva
bug-reports 2021-11-03 00:14:10 I cant switch hover drives for a different kind of engine
bug-reports 2021-11-03 00:14:21 regular thrusters and engines make a drag loop
bug-reports 2021-11-03 00:14:30 which throws off the balance of da ships
bug-reports 2021-11-03 00:16:00 cool but wrong channel
bug-reports 2021-11-03 00:17:51 putting this video back here one more time 4 good measure someone fix dis bug
bug-reports 2021-11-03 00:18:44 again it happen with hover drives and motor 2s in the same grid
bug-reports 2021-11-03 00:19:05 had several other people tell me they also experienced this bug as well
bug-reports 2021-11-03 02:06:06 if you arent trolling when you say that, I have literally tried every different technique I know, I swapped the motors around, I switched the hover drive from pistons to springs to suspensions to landing gear, and I stated that it does not function anyways if you use normal rockets or prop engines because it throws off the balance which takes hours to get perfect
bug-reports 2021-11-03 02:06:47 that's
bug-reports 2021-11-03 02:06:49 it
bug-reports 2021-11-03 02:06:49 how
bug-reports 2021-11-03 02:06:50 was
bug-reports 2021-11-03 02:06:52 designed
bug-reports 2021-11-03 02:06:53 to work
bug-reports 2021-11-03 02:07:22 I literally just said those make a drag loop which throws off the balance and they arent powerful enough anyways
bug-reports 2021-11-03 02:07:37 Im talking about my turning mechanism
bug-reports 2021-11-03 02:07:40 not my propulsion
bug-reports 2021-11-03 02:08:00 I just said
bug-reports 2021-11-03 02:08:02 they dont work
bug-reports 2021-11-03 02:08:17 please tell me you arent trolling because the only way to fix it is to delete the ship or fix the bug
bug-reports 2021-11-03 02:08:25 im being dead serious
bug-reports 2021-11-03 02:09:00 ive already tried all the things you listed and they dont function properly
bug-reports 2021-11-03 02:09:23 my ships are literally designed around the turning engines
bug-reports 2021-11-03 02:09:35 changing them to flaps would mean deleting the ship and rebuilding it
bug-reports 2021-11-03 02:09:52 it's designed to work with mouse turning
bug-reports 2021-11-03 02:09:55 not wasd
bug-reports 2021-11-03 02:10:23 that would mean deleting my ship
bug-reports 2021-11-03 02:10:45 you are giving me solutions which just create more problems
bug-reports 2021-11-03 02:11:24 I can't tell whether you're being serious or not but you aren't helping
bug-reports 2021-11-03 02:12:19 my ships dont work with wasd
bug-reports 2021-11-03 02:12:26 what is it that you dont understand
bug-reports 2021-11-03 02:12:44 how do I mute someone
bug-reports 2021-11-03 02:15:41 shame
bug-reports 2021-11-03 02:16:48 and also nemesis it isnt my job to fix bugs in the game by breaking my own builds
bug-reports 2021-11-03 02:17:01 literally the whole point of this channel/why I posted it here
bug-reports 2021-11-03 02:18:17 the reason I said that is cuz I posted about it before and there was no response whatsoever
bug-reports 2021-11-03 02:18:53 why does no one talk about it
bug-reports 2021-11-03 02:19:09 ?
bug-reports 2021-11-03 02:19:15 pardon I forgot what that means
bug-reports 2021-11-03 02:19:27 brh
bug-reports 2021-11-03 02:19:48 so it's just too minor of a bug for anybody to care about fixing it
bug-reports 2021-11-03 02:20:28 3 of my best ships which I spent hours making wont work again unless that bug is fixed
bug-reports 2021-11-03 02:21:12 true it is fun to tumble but an uncontrolled tumble is just a crash
bug-reports 2021-11-03 02:21:19 I want my builds back
bug-reports 2021-11-03 02:21:42 I spent money on this game I at least expect my stuff to work properly
bug-reports 2021-11-03 02:22:20 this is a ship I built right before the bug started effecting my builds
bug-reports 2021-11-03 02:22:45 doesn't look like much, but I actually spent over 4 hours making everything perfect
bug-reports 2021-11-03 02:22:57 it doesnt function properly with any other engine controlling the turning mechanism
bug-reports 2021-11-03 02:23:14 
bug-reports 2021-11-03 02:23:23 I don't have a video yet for the other 2 ships but I can get one in a jiffy
bug-reports 2021-11-03 02:23:35 cuz I only really use the one in the video
bug-reports 2021-11-03 02:23:38 used*
bug-reports 2021-11-03 02:24:23 I know exactly what causes it
bug-reports 2021-11-03 02:24:44 yes
bug-reports 2021-11-03 02:24:49 always within a minute
bug-reports 2021-11-03 02:24:51 of spawning
bug-reports 2021-11-03 02:25:07 sometimes it might survive for 2 minutes
bug-reports 2021-11-03 02:25:16 or sometimes it will break within 2 seconds of spawning
bug-reports 2021-11-03 02:25:38 it is a bug on the engines that control the t u r n i n g
bug-reports 2021-11-03 02:25:44 nemesis
bug-reports 2021-11-03 02:25:55 the engines are on g i m b a l s
bug-reports 2021-11-03 02:26:11 g_i_m_b_a_l_s
bug-reports 2021-11-03 02:26:28 I cannt simply swap them for something different
bug-reports 2021-11-03 02:27:45 ?
bug-reports 2021-11-03 02:31:17 place hover drive on any grid with a motor 2 attached to it
bug-reports 2021-11-03 02:31:25 motor 2 can have any settings
bug-reports 2021-11-03 02:32:22 hover drive can use any medium (pistons/motors/springs/suspension)
bug-reports 2021-11-03 02:32:53 it also bugged out a helicopter  I was trying to build because the blades were tilted with motor 2
bug-reports 2021-11-03 02:33:22 for a specific example outside spaceships
bug-reports 2021-11-03 02:33:33 with gimbal engines
bug-reports 2021-11-03 02:34:11 I will buy more roux and donate it -NO CAP- if this bug gets fixed
bug-reports 2021-11-03 02:40:00 alrite
bug-reports 2021-11-03 02:42:22 <@!217336009455566848>
bug-reports 2021-11-03 02:42:41 these are several different kinds of standalone hover drives
bug-reports 2021-11-03 02:43:07 hover engines will not only react with the ground and other player builds, but will also react to seperate grids in your own builds
bug-reports 2021-11-03 02:43:43 hundreds (if not thousands) of players use them as a way of very fast propulsion as they are very powerful
bug-reports 2021-11-03 02:44:17 they will not affect parts attached using locked motors
bug-reports 2021-11-03 02:45:00 the bug im experiencing is caused when a grid with a hover drive is attached to a grid with a motor2
bug-reports 2021-11-03 02:45:13 or actuated by a motor2
bug-reports 2021-11-03 02:45:28 several other players ive talked to also experience this bug
bug-reports 2021-11-03 02:45:57 it causes your game to stutter for about half a second, after which all loss of physics occurs and your build plummets from the sky
bug-reports 2021-11-03 02:46:14 only way to fix is by respawning
bug-reports 2021-11-03 02:49:36 actually it appears the glitch might have been fixed with the new update just now
bug-reports 2021-11-03 02:49:40 im not experiencing it anymore
bug-reports 2021-11-03 02:50:34 well
bug-reports 2021-11-03 02:50:41 it seems that
bug-reports 2021-11-03 02:50:46 the problem has actually been fixed
bug-reports 2021-11-03 02:50:56 there was an update just now
bug-reports 2021-11-03 02:51:02 im no longer experiencing the bug
bug-reports 2021-11-03 02:52:22 yes it is very good ðŸ™‚
bug-reports 2021-11-03 02:52:27 I am very happy
bug-reports 2021-11-03 02:53:06 I DONATE ROUX NOW
bug-reports 2021-11-03 02:53:57 oof dont have enough roux left to donate gota buy moar

creations-chat 2021-11-11 18:10:32 I can relate to this a little
creations-chat 2021-11-11 18:16:28 my bad just wanted him to know that feeling is normal
creations-chat 2021-11-12 17:50:15 https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/384025409945337856/908755466815959050 is there some kind of reason everybody downvoted this guy so much
creations-chat 2021-11-12 18:04:49 I mean as in like, his build looks pretty good but it still got downvoted to hell did he do something or what
creations-chat 2021-11-12 18:08:13 to clarify, I AM NOT talking about my build
creations-chat 2021-11-12 18:10:45 I am asking about why the VIGGEN got downvoted, not my A 10 (I already know why mine did cuz it sucks)
creations-chat 2021-11-12 18:12:47 I think making the angle on that tail a bit less intense would help but idk what plane you're making
bug-reports 2021-11-26 21:46:01 I started having this bug again that was fixed in the last update. It is not a server problem because it happened in any server I went to.
bug-reports 2021-11-26 21:46:17 Happens with hover engines that are attached to motor2
bug-reports 2021-11-26 21:47:00 spoke with <@!217336009455566848>  about it last time, but issue was never clarified
bug-reports 2021-11-26 21:47:32 4 of my builds are currently out of order again due to this bug
bug-reports 2021-11-26 21:47:37 including the 2 in the videos
bug-reports 2021-11-26 21:48:17 The little stutter then loss of physics is the result of the bug.
bug-reports 2021-11-26 21:50:01 Getting out then getting back in does not fix the bug.
the-dump 2022-01-18 00:13:41 <:JumboJet:559121641355870220>
bug-reports 2022-04-12 06:06:36 ayo wtf is this
bug-reports 2022-04-12 06:07:15 happens whenever  I attach a hover drive to a motor
bug-reports 2022-04-12 06:07:31 whole thing loses physics and starts spazzing
bug-reports 2022-04-12 06:08:09 that's just lag
bug-reports 2022-04-12 17:32:28 Can confirm itâ€™s not a lag issue. Based on what Iâ€™ve seen, it only happens when you attach a hover drive (usually on its own wit jus hover engine + motor/piston) to a motor/motor 2

I build spaceships which use sortuhh gimbal hover drives for turning, and it breaks them repeatedly and gets very annoying
bug-reports 2022-04-12 17:32:48 Also broke a helicopter I made once that used hover drives to spin the rotor
bug-reports 2022-04-12 17:33:41 Doesnâ€™t affect everybody, just certain players, and every few months the bug stops acting up, particularly after a roblox update or a game update
bug-reports 2022-04-12 17:35:27 The build will do fine for a few seconds after spawning (or a few minutes) then will experience a single wild convulsion, which then all physics/thrusters quit working, and your build falls out of the sky as though wing panels were nonexistent
bug-reports 2022-04-12 17:36:01 And it will keep convulsing and lagging until you de spawn and try again
bug-reports 2022-04-12 17:36:57 What device
bug-reports 2022-04-12 17:38:06 Ohhh
bug-reports 2022-04-12 17:38:22 That might actually be the case
bug-reports 2022-04-12 17:38:32 I tried playing on my friends pc and it didnâ€™t happen
bug-reports 2022-04-12 17:38:53 Although after roblox updates the bug usually goes away for a while
bug-reports 2022-04-12 17:39:06 And then pops up again randomly
bug-reports 2022-04-12 17:39:55 You know any solutions
bug-reports 2022-04-12 17:40:09 The bug makes me literally wanna rip my skull out
bug-reports 2022-04-12 17:40:57 I see
bug-reports 2022-04-12 17:41:06 Thanks for the info
bug-reports 2022-04-12 21:53:56 ah yes good ole invis glitch
bug-reports 2022-04-12 21:54:10 no it will never be fixed because that would make the world a good place
bug-reports 2022-04-12 21:54:13 and nobody wants that
bug-reports 2022-04-14 00:01:20 you won't like the answer
bug-reports 2022-04-14 00:01:22 to that question
bug-reports 2022-04-14 00:01:37 it has nothing to do with the game
bug-reports 2022-04-14 00:01:48 roblox removed all copyrighted/original music ids from roblox
bug-reports 2022-04-14 00:01:51 over 6 seconds long
bug-reports 2022-04-14 00:02:10 then they probably just got rid of it
bug-reports 2022-04-14 00:02:13 for some reason
bug-reports 2022-04-14 00:02:20 ids get deleted all the time
bug-reports 2022-04-14 00:02:44 there you go
creations-chat 2022-04-14 00:38:08 I gotta admit that's pretty heckin neat
bug-reports 2022-04-14 01:00:25 lol and it's supposed to be protecting the original creator by deleting it
creations-chat 2022-04-14 15:25:05 holy shit that's cooler than zane from lego ninjago
bug-reports 2022-04-14 15:26:19 known glitch, it is indeed very annoying, you'll just have to replace them everytime you spawn or use another block
bug-reports 2022-04-14 15:26:38 when I get it I just replace them everytime I load the save
bug-reports 2022-04-14 15:27:11 if you have any idea what is causing it for you, however, then that could be very helpful to figuring out the cause of the bug

bug-reports 2022-04-14 15:33:30 ?
bug-reports 2022-04-14 15:33:59 sorry can rephrase that I legitimately have no idea what you are trying to say there

creations-chat 2022-04-14 17:17:04 If thatâ€™s a spaceship of some sort, I legitimately recommend putting a cockpit between that gap where youâ€™re standing

the-dump 2022-06-21 19:38:10 <@699259264899743776>  the way you recovered from every crash astounds me
the-dump 2022-06-21 19:39:40 and the standoff between the two reapers in the background
the-dump 2022-06-22 06:27:16 aegis shenanigans from today
the-dump 2022-06-22 06:28:01 <@613986732437667851>
the-dump 2022-06-22 06:28:28 pay attention to the background in the first one
the-dump 2022-06-22 06:31:31 no the silly was the two reapers
the-dump 2022-06-22 06:31:35 playing around the mound of dirt
the-dump 2022-06-22 06:32:44 
the-dump 2022-06-22 06:35:15 we accomplished a peaceful 3 way base in the center
the-dump 2022-06-22 06:36:58 it wa a mix of all three factions
the-dump 2022-06-22 06:37:20 if I had opened fire it would have both destroyed the peace we'd maintained for several hours and also they would turn around and blow up our stuff

the-dump 2022-07-03 06:29:18 that video
the-dump 2022-07-03 06:29:19 I felt
the-dump 2022-07-03 06:29:26 perfectly summed up the functionality of plane crazy
the-dump 2022-07-03 06:29:52 I rammed jetpack guy and then he was just stuck to me like glue
the-dump 2022-07-08 23:47:04 Almost have this version of the level verified

the-dump 2022-07-08 23:50:58 Almost have this version verified
the-dump 2022-08-29 03:06:08 <@699259264899743776> im trying out new level
the-dump 2022-08-29 03:06:10 storming summit
the-dump 2022-08-29 03:06:36 got 11% so far
the-dump 2022-08-29 03:07:17 level slowing down isnt hacks
the-dump 2022-08-29 03:07:21 it's just my pc lagging
the-dump 2022-08-29 03:07:51 I got one of the beat drop sections fluked
the-dump 2022-08-29 03:08:00 while practicing
the-dump 2022-08-29 03:15:39 if the music for that particular level didn't absolutely SLAP, I would not have the fortitude to play it
the-dump 2022-08-29 03:17:03 fr
the-dump 2022-08-29 03:17:20 only reason to play a level is if it has good music
the-dump 2022-08-29 03:19:24 I have to play every level in ldm
the-dump 2022-08-29 03:19:40 for some reason a LITERAL block game runs my pc up more than even plane crazy
the-dump 2022-08-29 04:38:51 <@699259264899743776> I got the next part down I just need to put them together

the-dump 2022-09-04 04:29:12 <@699259264899743776>

the-dump 2022-09-04 04:30:20 finally got 41-61
the-dump 2022-09-04 04:41:03 look at those hitboxes
the-dump 2022-09-05 14:19:12 Nice
the-dump 2022-09-05 14:19:29 Looks like you mightâ€™ve screwed up the center of thrust a lot though
the-dump 2022-09-07 04:42:31 <@701675241084289054>

the-dump 2022-09-14 04:05:05

the-dump 2022-09-14 04:53:50 ignore these I just want to download them on my phone
the-dump 2022-09-14 04:54:04 it's faster to go through the dump than email them to myself

bug-reports 2022-10-09 14:24:13 server lag
bug-reports 2022-10-09 14:24:20 not framerate
bug-reports 2022-10-09 14:24:22 but ping
bug-reports 2022-10-09 14:24:45 it will *make* spawning in alot harder
bug-reports 2022-10-09 14:24:58 but no it doesn't only happen with spawning
bug-reports 2022-10-09 14:25:20 it's sort of like in minecraft when you can't pick up/break any blocks on a server
bug-reports 2022-10-09 14:25:26 rip
bug-reports 2022-10-09 14:25:43 if you just load into any plane crazy server
bug-reports 2022-10-09 14:25:46 or even a private server
bug-reports 2022-10-09 14:25:53 you won't have to try very hard to notice
bug-reports 2022-10-09 14:26:04 they happen about very 10-15 seconds
bug-reports 2022-10-09 14:26:08 and last about the same time
