bug-reports 2019-09-10 07:55:29 the problem with the Angle and torque not saving on Motor2 is the values of those two problems are switched so when you load the build the max torque is now in the Max Angle slot and the Max Angle is in the Torque slot thats all thats effected.
bug-reports 2019-09-10 07:56:13 so if you put 180 in max angle and save and load when you next look the Max Torque will now be 180 and max angle default 30
