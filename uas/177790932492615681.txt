plane-crazy 2020-05-21 02:26:57 Oh I thought you clapped him
plane-crazy 2020-05-21 02:26:07 Woah
plane-crazy 2020-05-21 02:23:47 ðŸ˜© doors
plane-crazy 2020-05-21 02:23:10 lol
plane-crazy 2020-05-21 02:22:24 a type of language consisting of words and phrases that are regarded as very informal, are more common in speech than writing, and are typically restricted to a particular context or group of people.
plane-crazy 2020-05-21 02:22:00 gonna look up the definition of slang words
plane-crazy 2020-05-21 02:21:18 going and to <
plane-crazy 2020-05-21 02:21:10 going to is two sperate words.
plane-crazy 2020-05-21 02:20:48 impossible
plane-crazy 2020-05-21 02:20:03 shoot that bang there goes and engine
plane-crazy 2020-05-21 02:12:38 Whom'st thin think thou are
plane-crazy 2020-05-21 02:12:05 Sometimes pokemon are so bad they just need to cease
plane-crazy 2020-05-21 02:10:25 there was an attempt
plane-crazy 2020-05-21 02:10:06 but till you bring me a person that slangs the word "to" then I will be impressed
plane-crazy 2020-05-21 02:09:48 Yeah I know
plane-crazy 2020-05-21 02:09:26 then you have words that don't really require slang
plane-crazy 2020-05-21 02:09:12 Well sometimes slang words make sense
plane-crazy 2020-05-21 02:08:37 Well you see it's like the word "finna" people could just say "gonna" but here we are
plane-crazy 2020-05-21 02:07:54 derp is a "nice" way of saying stupid
plane-crazy 2020-05-21 02:07:24 Yes a very intellectual conversation with a mix of drama in there a very good story from the aggressive start to the calm decline into friendship over a correct way to grow up
plane-crazy 2020-05-21 02:06:00 I stand by that
plane-crazy 2020-05-21 02:05:02 mate if you didn't learn how bubble-gum was made as a kid you have no childhood in my opinion
plane-crazy 2020-05-21 02:04:33 Was a top notch show
plane-crazy 2020-05-21 02:04:21 I loved that on TV
plane-crazy 2020-05-21 02:03:52 like for boxes or like that thin cardboard paper
plane-crazy 2020-05-21 02:03:43 well its a different process for cardboard depends on the type of cardboard
plane-crazy 2020-05-21 02:03:09 so the correct sentence is it's made of wood like paper
plane-crazy 2020-05-21 02:02:58 well actually it's made of wood
plane-crazy 2020-05-21 02:02:46 but it's a superior paper
plane-crazy 2020-05-21 02:02:28 Cardboard walls are better then paper, change my mind
plane-crazy 2020-05-21 02:02:05 Not really an argument he just suddenly got offended and called me 12 even though I was being chill lol but cool guess we are now
plane-crazy 2020-05-21 02:01:27 with wall paper and shiz
plane-crazy 2020-05-21 02:01:21 No my walls a brick
plane-crazy 2020-05-21 02:01:13 Okay then, apparently you're that type of person was being nice and talking but you're just gonna be like that.
plane-crazy 2020-05-21 02:00:14 and they went to go make buildings out of paper and wood
plane-crazy 2020-05-21 02:00:05 Or the builders got told by the teachers they where experts in arts and crafts
plane-crazy 2020-05-21 01:58:56 a very crap wall then
plane-crazy 2020-05-21 01:58:28 and wood
plane-crazy 2020-05-21 01:58:24 Then thats not a wall thats just paper
plane-crazy 2020-05-21 01:57:04 so by all means punch the wall all you want its your hand
plane-crazy 2020-05-21 01:56:50 I'd flip the other parts and fit the gaps but apparently the game doesnt want me to
plane-crazy 2020-05-21 01:56:23 what do you want from me
plane-crazy 2020-05-21 01:56:20 also its blocks
plane-crazy 2020-05-21 01:56:18 well its better then the other
plane-crazy 2020-05-21 01:54:02 which is the line in the middle
plane-crazy 2020-05-21 01:53:57 trying to smooth it off into a point
plane-crazy 2020-05-21 01:53:45 thats the front
plane-crazy 2020-05-21 01:53:27 I mean this is a start kinda
plane-crazy 2020-05-21 01:51:49 When your trying to pretty up the under side curve of a ship but have no idea where to start.
plane-crazy 2020-05-21 01:46:46 are you having a stroke?
plane-crazy 2020-05-21 01:41:34 Thank you for your constructive feedback, I shall improve my way of suggesting features Mr eXoKay
plane-crazy 2020-05-21 01:40:33 or just a UI to config parts without actually having to click on the block if its hidden under parts.
plane-crazy 2020-05-21 01:40:16 They need to add a feature to search for a block in your build like a config block because I have to rip a build apart just to find a part I forgot where it is located
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 03:49:31 Legit all I did was remove a block replace it with something and then when it didnt work the way I wanted I put the block back and it some how shifted the entire centre of mass
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 03:46:31 and hope it balances out again
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 03:46:21 so I just edit it blind
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 03:45:43 Because I did some changes and then reverted back and now the mass is off from where it was before and its messed up the whole build so I wanna just put it back to where it was
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 03:44:35 because it doesnt move when I change the values.
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 03:44:23 Do ballast blocks effect the centre of mass?
plane-crazy 2020-01-05 21:29:51 it board sides enemy ships
plane-crazy 2020-01-05 21:29:17 <@!612692049375789102> It's a board side heavy ship
plane-crazy 2020-01-05 21:11:07 They're duel cannon since they are pretty much flak cannons
plane-crazy 2020-01-05 21:10:40 two big bois
plane-crazy 2020-01-03 00:27:37 Operating System
plane-crazy 2020-01-03 00:27:21 are you still using an old windows OS
plane-crazy 2020-01-03 00:01:55 how does one forget a game is running
plane-crazy 2020-01-03 00:01:43 how does that work
plane-crazy 2020-01-02 23:59:32 el compacto
plane-crazy 2020-01-02 23:29:12 ðŸ‘Œ
plane-crazy 2020-01-02 23:28:49 oof
plane-crazy 2020-01-02 23:28:45 also separate the hair and put it on another layer so the hair is over the face not the other way around
plane-crazy 2020-01-02 23:28:01 if your really good with it you could make it look like shreks face is a drawing and is meant to be there
plane-crazy 2020-01-02 23:27:16 would look ðŸ‘Œ
plane-crazy 2020-01-02 23:26:57 should've blended the lighting of shreks face to match the surroundings
plane-crazy 2020-01-02 23:26:08 very nice ðŸ‘Œ
plane-crazy 2020-01-02 23:25:53 is that Shrekus
plane-crazy 2020-01-02 23:25:45 also love the pfp
plane-crazy 2020-01-02 23:25:11 kidding it makes the build fucking ugly
plane-crazy 2020-01-02 23:24:59 the swearding
plane-crazy 2020-01-02 23:24:40 if you want me to say the other word then I shall
plane-crazy 2020-01-02 23:24:20 yes
plane-crazy 2020-01-02 23:24:08 which make the thing ugly sauce
plane-crazy 2020-01-02 23:23:49 on the wings
plane-crazy 2020-01-02 23:23:47 and then have blocky guided missiles
plane-crazy 2020-01-02 23:23:41 you could have a clean looking helicopter or plane
plane-crazy 2020-01-02 23:23:19 Because the guided missiles are ugly
plane-crazy 2020-01-02 23:22:51 and it destroys the look
plane-crazy 2020-01-02 23:22:46 you have to make those things big
plane-crazy 2020-01-02 23:22:42 Also the thing with those guided missiles
plane-crazy 2020-01-02 23:22:19 because weight
plane-crazy 2020-01-02 23:22:17 you make the functional frame less functional
plane-crazy 2020-01-02 23:22:09 just the thing is when you make a functional helicopter frame and then add details over the functional frame
plane-crazy 2020-01-02 23:21:39 Well I like big boi helicopters
plane-crazy 2020-01-02 23:21:00 but then you'd have to make it bigger
plane-crazy 2020-01-02 23:20:52 making none Coaxial kinda gets rid of the realism of tail rotor spinning unless you make an internal functional one and then make a design one on the outside
plane-crazy 2020-01-02 23:20:02 cool no tail rotor
plane-crazy 2020-01-02 23:19:58 it's coax so
plane-crazy 2020-01-02 23:19:54 I have what ever the fuck this thing is
plane-crazy 2020-01-02 23:19:21 I build it to have it there it'll be changed
plane-crazy 2020-01-02 23:19:08 just look at that wip rocket arm
plane-crazy 2020-01-02 23:18:19 I'll see myself out
plane-crazy 2020-01-02 23:18:16 okay I'll throw myself off the bridge
plane-crazy 2020-01-02 23:18:09 I-i-it's not finished
plane-crazy 2020-01-02 23:17:52 I'll dislike just because
plane-crazy 2020-01-02 23:16:51 get them schematics ma dud
plane-crazy 2020-01-02 23:16:31 or you could just get reference images on google and start building 5head
plane-crazy 2020-01-02 23:15:57 send post cards
plane-crazy 2020-01-02 23:15:35 just use an AA gun 4head
plane-crazy 2020-01-02 23:13:25 to have enough room
plane-crazy 2020-01-02 23:13:22 I'll have remove the whole upper part and move it up by one
plane-crazy 2020-01-02 23:12:58 lol
plane-crazy 2020-01-02 23:12:57 like right now the inside of my helicopters engine pod it has no wall
plane-crazy 2020-01-02 23:12:30 sometimes you gotta ignore detail and go for functionality
plane-crazy 2020-01-02 23:11:21 now I just add testing stuff to it and remove the parts I dont want
plane-crazy 2020-01-02 23:10:45 I used to do it for recovery when testing
plane-crazy 2020-01-02 23:10:17 and now just make stable builds
plane-crazy 2020-01-02 23:10:09 so I just left anchor blocks
plane-crazy 2020-01-02 23:10:02 all the times I've tried it does
plane-crazy 2020-01-02 23:09:47 unless they updated it
plane-crazy 2020-01-02 23:09:25 when physics is not enabled
plane-crazy 2020-01-02 23:09:21 no motors get locked as well
plane-crazy 2020-01-02 23:02:30 It's sad that I cant use my extra two buttons on my mouse as a key bind FeelsBadMan
plane-crazy 2020-01-02 23:01:13 my flight controls are E up Q down and W A S D
plane-crazy 2020-01-02 23:00:57 Anyone recommend a keybind for Firework Rocket pods?
plane-crazy 2019-12-25 15:58:48 Mac 10 ejection seat
plane-crazy 2019-12-25 15:50:36 idk then
plane-crazy 2019-12-25 15:49:13 hmm
plane-crazy 2019-12-25 15:48:59 use a normal motor for folds
plane-crazy 2019-12-25 15:48:32 Motor2 is just broken I guess
plane-crazy 2019-12-25 15:48:09 when using a Anchor block always keep physics enabled
plane-crazy 2019-12-25 15:47:51 okay
plane-crazy 2019-12-25 15:47:30 thats why you cant move because physics is disabled on your build
plane-crazy 2019-12-25 15:47:18 on that
plane-crazy 2019-12-25 15:47:16 toggle physics
plane-crazy 2019-12-25 15:47:13 yeah
plane-crazy 2019-12-25 15:46:47 so just use motors
plane-crazy 2019-12-25 15:46:35 breaks everything
plane-crazy 2019-12-25 15:46:32 Motor2 with any torque in water or in a fast build
plane-crazy 2019-12-25 15:45:51 could just not have enough torque to move that
plane-crazy 2019-12-25 15:45:37 ^
plane-crazy 2019-12-25 15:45:18 he said default
plane-crazy 2019-12-25 15:44:59 make sure the servo isnt toggled
plane-crazy 2019-12-25 15:44:45 or servo?
plane-crazy 2019-12-25 15:44:42 are you using mouse movement
plane-crazy 2019-12-25 15:43:27 try saving and rejoining
plane-crazy 2019-12-25 15:43:19 could be a bug with the script not loading
plane-crazy 2019-12-25 15:42:27 because its defiantly not heavy and its not blocked try messing with the settings could be under powered
plane-crazy 2019-12-25 15:42:00 could be broken?
plane-crazy 2019-12-25 15:41:57 hmm
plane-crazy 2019-12-25 15:41:25 so make sure the area the motor rotates is clear
plane-crazy 2019-12-25 15:41:16 or you could have a block which is stopping it from rotating
plane-crazy 2019-12-25 15:41:06 sometimes they dont move
plane-crazy 2019-12-25 15:41:03 sometimes it works
plane-crazy 2019-12-25 15:40:44 for some reason the blocks with the top part removed doesnt actually work with Motor2
plane-crazy 2019-12-25 15:40:15 yeah thats a bug
plane-crazy 2019-12-25 15:39:46 so anything other then that you should be fine
plane-crazy 2019-12-25 15:39:40 motor2's are very hard for being used as Helicopter Rotors
plane-crazy 2019-12-23 13:57:32 zero marks failed this question
plane-crazy 2019-12-23 13:57:08 seems legit
plane-crazy 2019-12-23 13:54:47 lol
plane-crazy 2019-12-23 13:54:45 sneaky mother fucker
plane-crazy 2019-12-23 13:54:17 lol

plane-crazy 2019-12-23 13:52:32 then when the world explodes they'll be there
plane-crazy 2019-12-23 13:52:18 they watch everyone leave
plane-crazy 2019-12-23 13:52:10 they never die
plane-crazy 2019-12-23 13:52:05 you know whats worse then wishing death upon someone, eternal life
plane-crazy 2019-12-23 13:51:30 commit none existance

plane-crazy 2019-12-10 14:23:28 all it takes is someone to spawn in a bigger build and your plane suddenly stops reacting like it used to and is either hard to control or stop or it just doesnt fly
plane-crazy 2019-12-10 14:22:24 with 4 side rockets and two main rockets
plane-crazy 2019-12-10 14:22:16 its a big plane
plane-crazy 2019-12-10 14:21:52 yeah I just added a extra Delta and it reduced it but didnt fully stop it
plane-crazy 2019-12-10 14:21:28 Nvm I just added an extra bit to the tail fin and it reduced wobble
plane-crazy 2019-12-10 14:18:02 or is that just the result of speed
plane-crazy 2019-12-10 14:17:24 If a plane wobbles side to side is that the result of lack of tail fin or some other force?
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 16:24:01 Okay so Roblox's String Filter is filtering out any numbers so now I cant add tail numbers to my build noice
plane-crazy 2019-12-08 17:16:55 "an "all-big-gun" armament scheme, with more heavy-calibre guns than previous ships;"
plane-crazy 2019-12-08 17:16:16 The dreadnought was the predominant type of battleship in the early 20th century. The first of its kind, the Royal Navy's HMS Dreadnought, made such a strong impression on people's minds when launched in 1906 that similar battleships built subsequently were referred to generically as "dreadnoughts", and earlier battleships became known as "pre-dreadnoughts". Dreadnought was optimized for long-range battles. It had two revolutionary features: an "all-big-gun" armament scheme, with more heavy-calibre guns than previous ships; and steam turbine propulsion.
plane-crazy 2019-12-08 17:15:07 <@!414778672847781888> wrong
plane-crazy 2019-12-08 17:14:45 Dreadnoughts are bigger and more armed then a Battleship hence the new name

plane-crazy 2019-09-29 04:39:24 okay there its fixed itself
plane-crazy 2019-09-29 04:38:30 or they messed up because a game normally shouldnt be able to kill a wifi network

plane-crazy 2019-09-29 04:37:52 Mk apparently teleporting to PVP crashes my Wi-Fi

plane-crazy 2019-09-14 09:57:57 Its only just started doing it so why has it started when I havent changed any weight appart from the roof when I was redesigning it but that was only the front
plane-crazy 2019-09-14 09:57:02 and moving
plane-crazy 2019-09-14 09:57:00 It does it when idle
plane-crazy 2019-09-14 09:56:47 This is front heavy but its only just started doing it
plane-crazy 2019-09-14 09:56:22 my boat just suddenly started doing it
plane-crazy 2019-09-14 09:56:02 Anyone know how to deal with boats bouncing in the water side to side or up and down?
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 18:28:15 like sticking a prop engine to the tip to turn it faster
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 18:28:04 but they require cheap methoreds
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 18:27:24 well you can attach one for better aim

plane-crazy 2019-09-09 08:05:12 I've heard that meany times try another joke.
plane-crazy 2019-09-09 08:05:00 LAG lag
plane-crazy 2019-09-09 08:04:59 I dont mean
plane-crazy 2019-09-09 08:04:57 thats what I mean
plane-crazy 2019-09-09 08:04:54 Try flying a helicopter which is balanced based when someone has a 1m+ (example) and its going crazy and hard to control
plane-crazy 2019-09-09 08:03:32 sutters a small bit
plane-crazy 2019-09-09 08:03:28 and the GAME
plane-crazy 2019-09-09 08:03:24 you know when someone spawns a big build
plane-crazy 2019-09-09 08:02:16 its in roblox
plane-crazy 2019-09-09 08:02:12 I dont have a physics engine on my pc
plane-crazy 2019-09-09 08:02:07 Physics lag effects the games physics engine
plane-crazy 2019-09-09 08:01:53 No your not getting what I just said
plane-crazy 2019-09-09 07:59:39 I dont get when you mention someones 1k+ build is causing phsyics lag they respond with "get a better computer" it has nothing to do with my computer its the game itself having problems dealing with your build traveling at a high rate of speed and shooting and using jets all at once lmao
plane-crazy 2019-09-07 05:19:29 I dont get why people make builds and then plaster it with loads of Explosives all over it
plane-crazy 2019-08-19 12:49:32 <@456226577798135808> sure
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 17:41:46 so it cant possibly be stuck there
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 17:41:41 thats why I now just clear the build after saving it and then leave
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 17:40:18 just in case a glitch like that ever does happen then the mods can just ban them
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 17:39:51 that should be a ban able offense
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 17:38:47 or someone could straight up join save your build and then dip
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 17:38:33 I'm thankful they cant touch or save your build when that happens
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 17:37:44 big oof
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 17:37:43 yeah its where two peoples builds are in the same plot
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 17:37:10 wonder if anyone has made a spring loaded bat machine which you just line up to the edge of the map and soon as someone comes near you just straight up bat them lol
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 17:35:26 Theytip sounds like some kinda tipping service for waiters or something lmao there you go upcoming app makers theres a name for you I now shall demand Â£300 for the name thank me later all rights reserved.
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 17:33:32 the f is theytip
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 17:31:10 the bot is creeping
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 17:30:40 without the space
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 17:30:33 also dyno keeps reacting with the eyes when you say < 13
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 17:29:55 yeah discord never tells if if the server was banned or not they just delete all channels and lock the server and soon as the owner leaves it auto deletes
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 17:28:32 if the owner isnt banning <13 then discord just straight up deletes the whole server lul
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 17:27:26 well its the law so dab
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 17:26:19 ISPs are bad at their jobs lol
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 17:26:12 when is internet never laggy
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 17:25:57 Still a requirement
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 17:25:34 because on discord your required to ban anyone under the age of 13
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 17:06:27 what else would you be thinking about
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 17:06:19 I mean in the game
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 17:03:36 Motors are glitchy so I use the default wheels deal with it
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 17:02:31 causing the whole build to spaz out
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 17:02:16 someone that hates dealing with the wheels detaching themselves from the motor
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 17:01:47 
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 17:01:11 by turn I mean the steerable wheels can still turn
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 17:00:54 wheels work and turn
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 17:00:47 I just found out you can put blocks around the wheels and provide extra armour

plane-crazy 2019-07-27 23:24:33 He still thinks I was making the "Delete System32" meme when I was legit warning the people that could fall for the meme to not delete it as it'll break things lol
plane-crazy 2019-07-27 23:23:32 do you just not clean your PC or scan it at all lol

plane-crazy 2019-07-27 23:20:01 <@456226577798135808> No I was saying dont do it but if you wanna go do it I dont recommend it
plane-crazy 2019-07-27 23:19:26 its public everyones talking about the same topic
plane-crazy 2019-07-27 23:19:05 You know this is a public server right
plane-crazy 2019-07-27 23:18:50 no
plane-crazy 2019-07-27 23:18:42 <@218240161719386112> the hell was you doing to get 1k virus or errors
plane-crazy 2019-07-27 23:18:18 it'll run so fast it'll go into recovery mode which is a secret gaming mode
plane-crazy 2019-07-27 23:17:40 its a built in program
plane-crazy 2019-07-27 23:17:34 Just use Task Manager to kill Programs lol
plane-crazy 2019-07-27 23:16:54 System32 Folder is legit where all the important stuff is if you delete it your PC will straight up die lol
plane-crazy 2019-07-27 23:16:06 <@456226577798135808> go delete System32 see how long it takes the whole system to go into recovery mode.
plane-crazy 2019-07-27 23:15:38 If you delete your System32 folder you'd not have a PC working if you did that
plane-crazy 2019-07-27 23:15:03 You mean System32
plane-crazy 2019-07-27 23:14:35 E
plane-crazy 2019-07-27 23:14:34 I know everyone has one A
plane-crazy 2019-07-27 23:14:07 <@456226577798135808> no u
plane-crazy 2019-07-27 23:13:59 I also have my Adblocker which straight up aborts the connection
plane-crazy 2019-07-27 23:13:42 thats what Avast dones too
plane-crazy 2019-07-27 23:13:14 only way you'd get a virus which bricks your PC is if your actually looking to get one or doing something with a high risk of getting one so if your stupid then good luck lol
plane-crazy 2019-07-27 23:12:09 Tbh you barely run into any viruses which can really harm you if you have good protection only deadly viruses or worms are on illegal sites if you avoid those your never gonna see a Trojan or a worm in your entire time browsing on the internet.
plane-crazy 2019-07-27 23:10:58 soon as  Trojan gets into your Master Boot Record you're legit screwed lol
plane-crazy 2019-07-27 23:10:15 Boy you'd know if you had a Trojan on your PC it'll be bricked
plane-crazy 2019-07-27 23:09:05 I have an Adblocker an Anti-virus and a VPN along with a cleaner program which are all trusted and are good to protect me from low end attacks and medium attacks they're the only levels of attacks you'd get from basic browsing but if you do illegal stuff then you're gonna get a Trojan or something else powerful infecting your PC
plane-crazy 2019-07-27 23:07:23 but adblock doesnt stop background downloads
plane-crazy 2019-07-27 23:07:14 I use adblock
plane-crazy 2019-07-27 23:07:01 plus its fast at blocking stuff
plane-crazy 2019-07-27 23:06:46 Its legit caught a crap tone of stuff just from entering a site
plane-crazy 2019-07-27 23:06:28 no u
plane-crazy 2019-07-27 23:06:08 virus*
plane-crazy 2019-07-27 23:06:03 Avast or one of the other big companies which provide anti-vrisus

plane-crazy 2019-07-27 23:03:56 A

plane-crazy 2019-07-27 22:26:30 rip
plane-crazy 2019-07-27 22:25:01 questionable people for a questionable community.
plane-crazy 2019-07-27 21:44:31 the hell does it even exist anyway
plane-crazy 2019-07-27 21:44:15 even saves you've done
plane-crazy 2019-07-27 21:44:11 because I didnt know that when you hit the damn limit it deletes all the changes
plane-crazy 2019-07-27 21:43:50 and all that work is gone
plane-crazy 2019-07-27 21:43:46 you load it again
plane-crazy 2019-07-27 21:43:43 you dont notice
plane-crazy 2019-07-27 21:43:40 and the damn save data thing makes it so you cant save
plane-crazy 2019-07-27 21:43:28 you know when you make a massive build everything works
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 17:15:31 when you go past 100 rotors your helicopters hull is now counted as a blade
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 17:14:57 they wont know what rotor to hit
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 17:14:47 they'll never take you down
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 17:14:13 [insert that but twice the amount on one helicopter]
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 17:13:17 and so on
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 17:13:13 why have 1 when you can have 2 why have 2 when you can have 3
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 17:12:43 how many helicopter rotors is too many rotors ðŸ¤”
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 14:33:12 https://gyazo.com/7f6819ffe552cd4a8f00acb2a88a561b
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 14:33:11 if your happy and you know it clap your hands
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 14:30:05 now they just use a crap tone of parachutes and explosive blocks
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 14:29:22 its worse and worse the more you show us lmao
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 14:28:37 E
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 14:28:20 like a glove
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 14:27:25 sketchy memory lmao
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 14:26:49 when your memory is that bad even you dont trust it
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 14:26:06 how to fix roblox physics ``while true do end``
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 14:25:19 constructive feed back and conversations about how to make the game better is good better then your community being like "LUL MAKE THING WORK"
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 14:24:01 That shade of purple messes with my eyes I'm like "I'M GOING BLIND"
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 14:21:24 death by being clapped by your own creation <:lmfao:527971550360633393>
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 14:19:54 normal motors can be easily messed up and disalined hence people use Locked
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 14:15:16 I mean look at the Rotor Assembly someone made it was massive xd
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 14:15:02 When making stuff like that its hard to fit into a small build
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 14:14:37 was a good spiral to the floor
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 14:14:31 I've some how made both of the fans so that the left is on the right and the right is on the left
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 14:13:34 i.e these fans
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 14:13:33 
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 14:13:17 if I dont use motor lock the power of the massive fans make it clap itself to death
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 14:12:47 plus this happens
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 14:11:43 yes but the motors are very limiting since they break if you move too far and they disaline
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 14:10:29 yes
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 14:10:18 so you can set up a auto correction system for a helicopter which automatically rights and keeps itself stable lol
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 14:09:42 you know what would be good for the game Gyros
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 15:36:50 or here
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 15:36:48 in the game
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 15:36:42 where do you report people?
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 15:36:15 where do you report people
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 15:35:52 Where do you report people in this?
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 12:18:35 well if you give the roblox community the ability to build anything they will abuse it
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 12:16:44 unless you make a script which detects the placement of blocks and if it matches a banned set amount of blocks then yeet
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 12:14:44 because screw history! and yes I know that
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 12:13:40 tbh building the flag isnt bad its a historical item in history but if your legit saying "gas the" then you deserve to be shot and banned
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 12:12:51 E
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 12:12:28 thats the big bad
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 12:12:25 then
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 12:12:24 which come with it
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 12:12:21 but if they're saying the slurs
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 12:12:17 well having the flag isnt bad as its a historical thing
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 12:11:25 Sur gonna have to ask you to cease the historical flag as people get the big offended by history
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 12:10:52 I have Mee6 muted by default he's the big annoying
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 12:08:32 nvm you don't get it.
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 12:05:28 I was just saying how easy it is to deal with and stop
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 12:05:18 I didnt say you was
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 12:04:58 Then if they do you just ban them?
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 12:04:37 Thats stupid.
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 12:04:26 ðŸ¤”
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 12:04:15 Doesn't work.
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 12:02:50 the Suggestion room is locked and you cant do it anywhere else how is the community supposed to suggest things lmao
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 12:02:26 How do you suggest stuff
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 11:54:03 "EQUIPO"
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 11:47:54 it's like someone holding the door open for you and then you slamming the door in their face when you have walked through
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 11:47:27 Not if the person is legit giving you a complement about your building
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 11:46:23 those types of people are just ungrateful peace's of crap
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 11:45:49 when you complement someones build and they look at you and blacklist you without saying a word
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 01:06:14 E
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 17:09:29 idk why
