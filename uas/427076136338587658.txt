bug-reports 2019-02-10 00:10:11 not sure if i did something but the center of lift doesnt show?
bug-reports 2019-08-26 17:01:53 I've had a few battles in pvp and gun damage only seems to be on your own side, I've shot someone out of their guided missile and they were just a floating seat, on their end however, they didn't take any damage. after being strafed by someone, I was supposedly down 1 engine (I was in a 4 prop bomber) but on my screen I wasn't. When I spawned in a warship and the guided missile guy attacked, the tnt did break my creation, so TNT seems to work but guns don't (guns do work but its client side and results in ghost machines if you break a chunk off)
bug-reports 2019-08-31 13:42:34 seriously, fix pvp, when i shoot someone their vehicle sometimes freezes but they are somewhere else and would just shoot me and all i would see are their bullets
bug-reports 2019-09-02 00:25:18 gun damage is still local, i think its just that on your screen you done enough damage to break a part, but on their screen you didnt quite break it. but we still got flying wing sections or invisible planes. pvp is still broken
bug-reports 2019-09-02 17:13:04 no
bug-reports 2019-09-02 17:13:18 
bug-reports 2019-09-02 17:13:35 though before the last update, i did
bug-reports 2019-09-02 17:13:39 but same issue
bug-reports 2019-09-19 18:55:08 reasons why pvp needs to be fixed:
bug-reports 2019-09-19 18:55:15 what i see
bug-reports 2019-09-19 18:55:28 what my friend sees
bug-reports 2019-09-20 23:43:45 sometimes motor 2 just spins around rather than aim at the courser
bug-reports 2019-09-21 09:42:38 https://gyazo.com/e11a902edcafebe3605e3ca7f6ea68df sometimes it happens when you spawn in with a vehicle using motor 2, im always in pvp so i dont know if its just in that
bug-reports 2019-09-21 09:43:13 not sure if this is the debug menu tho
bug-reports 2019-11-27 23:36:31 not motor 2, but motor 1 and conveyors, if you use the conveyors to move then you turn the motors, then the 2 conveyors collide they fling you around
bug-reports 2019-11-27 23:37:08 proof
help 2019-12-12 20:33:00 it auto puts lift in center of mass
help 2019-12-12 20:33:22 but if the plane like, dips forwards, put 1 slightly infront of COM
help 2019-12-12 20:33:24 ect ect
bug-reports 2019-12-30 19:53:12 pvp is still broken, you sometimes break a part or many parts on your screen and somtimes it makes the whole enemy vehicle freeze, but on their screen its completely fine, please fix this bug, it has been around for ages and you have not fixed this pvp gamebreaking bug
bug-reports 2019-12-30 20:10:20 yea that pvp bug is ruining the game for me, i was hyped for todays update only to lose interest when i hit a guy with missiles and suddenly im being hunted by some ghost plane. **very fun indeed**

the-dump 2021-07-26 16:16:58 to be fair is it even copying if a huge amount of builds are copying real vehicles?
the-dump 2021-07-26 16:17:27 "how dare you copy my helicopter replica of a real helicopter" ðŸ˜ 
the-dump 2021-07-26 16:18:22 thats also true
the-dump 2021-08-07 20:26:06 not really good because theres a moderately large gacha life game on roblox, most of the users of GL would likely migrate to roblox instead...
the-dump 2021-10-04 13:06:28 NoOoO I dIdNT MeAN 'AlL'
the-dump 2021-11-07 17:45:22 reminds me of that video about a news channel calling a shotgun an ar-15

the-dump 2022-03-12 02:21:05 holy ones
the-dump 2022-03-12 02:21:37 i think you might wanna call a priest
the-dump 2022-03-30 01:33:25 of all the things on that, the most unrealistic is how they called it 'reliable'
the-dump 2022-03-31 22:45:56 "let people enjoy things" also includes letting people hate others , thus the statement targets itself
the-dump 2022-04-14 00:19:42 you can make an entire short story composed entirely of every variation of that word, and people who dont know welsh wouldnt have a clue that its just a dictionary for 1 word

the-dump 2022-07-09 18:04:15 T-34's are still used today, though it seems its almost always the 85 variant
the-dump 2022-07-27 00:45:41 not all bad news though, theres a chance that it will be added to a market so devs can buy it from the people who originally made the SFX
the-dump 2022-08-01 19:45:18 the thing i hate about the design is the suicide rocket pod on the tail aimed right at the cockpit
