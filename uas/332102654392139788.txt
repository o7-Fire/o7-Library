creations-chat 2022-12-23 22:50:06 yes
creations-chat 2022-12-23 23:53:45 try removing the rocket engine just to see how it looks
creations-chat 2022-12-23 23:56:01 i think the blue is too blue, it contrasts too much with the rocket engine, maybe make some sort of gradient (if thats possible)
creations-chat 2022-12-24 00:05:50 i made these afterburners if you want inspiration
ima screenshot when chat slowmode ends
creations-chat 2022-12-24 00:07:51 the lighter color is the one facing outwards, it has a longer lifetime which gives the gradient effect
the outer one has 0.05 lifetime, 2nd one has 0.05 too, 3rd one has 0.04 and 4th one has 0.03 liftime. outer one also has higher transparency
creations-chat 2022-12-24 00:14:51 wait no i got it completely wrong, light one is 0.5 transparency and 0.01 lifetime, blue ones are 0.1 transparency and  0.05 lifetime
creations-chat 2022-12-30 21:38:17 why
creations-chat 2022-12-30 22:56:24 bleh (i am dead)

creations-chat 2023-01-06 09:38:28 the spine seems a bit too angled down
creations-chat 2023-01-06 09:41:36 maybe like a half block highers spine, also a bit shorter nose maybe
creations-chat 2023-01-07 23:28:47 <@568036773750505502> how did you manage to make a roscale plane 1:2 scale
creations-chat 2023-01-07 23:30:53 no like why is it half scale if itâ€™s supposed to be roscale
creations-chat 2023-01-07 23:33:08 roscale is just irl dimensions, so roscale a-10 should be around 24 blocks long
creations-chat 2023-01-07 23:36:07 its like 5 blocks off in length, so not roscale, roscale phantom would be 27 blocks long
creations-chat 2023-01-07 23:38:13 Roscale phantom should be 27x17 blocks
creations-chat 2023-01-07 23:40:28 HOW LONG IS IT

I NEED TO KNOW

RAHHHHHHHH

creations-chat 2023-01-18 19:29:21 any feedback?
creations-chat 2023-01-18 19:32:04 damn
contest-chat 2023-01-18 23:10:05 because its smol (relative to its real size lmao)
contest-chat 2023-01-18 23:10:18 its 2 plots long
contest-chat 2023-01-18 23:10:24 used the entire height limit lmao
contest-chat 2023-01-18 23:11:17 if i change material to something like metal it gets too heavy
contest-chat 2023-01-18 23:11:40 so idk how to make it less plastic
creations-chat 2023-01-18 23:20:16 Smaller elevators, make the like front part of the wing transition smoothly  instead of the 1 block skip down (see image), also move the elevators up 1 block, they are too far away from the wing.
creations-chat 2023-01-18 23:26:43 i feel like deleting it now thanks
creations-chat 2023-01-18 23:28:50 uwuified munificent
