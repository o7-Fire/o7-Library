creations-chat 2022-09-12 17:46:46 alright
creations-chat 2022-09-12 17:49:12 i got a question for yall
is it possible to motorlock fold?
creations-chat 2022-09-12 17:51:14 yea alright
just wondering cause i just found a way i can use motor locks to fold my creation in an instant and not use motors that are exposed to the otuside and rotate creation which can be buggy with big heavy parts
creations-chat 2022-09-12 17:53:20 i just invented something new then :D
(i wanna post about it but i cant cause i gotta level up)
creations-chat 2022-09-12 17:55:41 ill post in creations when i can i just gotta talk to level up ;-; (we cant talk about it in general if u want cause this is hella slow chat because of the slowmode)
