creations-chat 2021-12-20 04:50:18 kinda forgot(but it was something about speeding airflow )(counteracts with low pressure air behind for more downforce smt like that)
creations-chat 2021-12-20 05:02:48 f-35, first ever motorlock(what can improve on)
creations-chat 2021-12-20 05:30:30 sorry was gone(the timer limit though)
creations-chat 2021-12-20 05:33:13 here(also all wings move)
creations-chat 2021-12-20 05:47:58 yeah engine intakes were kind of a problem, i really hated how it look but i was too lazy to change anything because on the model it curved in(but thats kind of impossible to do so i just overcomplicated block choice)
creations-chat 2021-12-20 06:00:02 is there any detail i could really improve on(other than wing size and intakes)
creations-chat 2021-12-20 06:06:36 well i know how motorlocks work but im not like totally good with it, like the customs angles n stuff still havent got the hang of it
creations-chat 2021-12-20 06:23:56 i did have to adjust it due to distribution issues(also was too tired and lazy to change it lmao)
