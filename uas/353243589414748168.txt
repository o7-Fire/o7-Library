plane-crazy 2020-06-22 00:37:18 that seems like something it might do
plane-crazy 2020-06-22 00:36:43 but i dont see much use other than that
plane-crazy 2020-06-22 00:36:35 the water effect on them looks cool
plane-crazy 2020-06-22 00:36:29 i mean
plane-crazy 2020-06-22 00:36:12 they dont do any damage though..?
plane-crazy 2020-06-22 00:33:52 nvm
plane-crazy 2020-06-22 00:33:51 someone asked like 2 seconds ago

plane-crazy 2020-06-22 00:33:34 so what exactly do the water blaster things do?

plane-crazy 2020-06-08 00:15:20 i feel like the wings look incomplete without them
plane-crazy 2020-06-08 00:15:10 i agree yeah
plane-crazy 2020-06-08 00:14:29 
plane-crazy 2020-06-08 00:14:28 which do you think looks better? (only difference is the bit on the wingtips)
plane-crazy 2020-06-07 16:42:54 thats utterly beautiful
plane-crazy 2020-06-07 16:42:42 ok holy shit
plane-crazy 2020-06-07 16:41:02 i love when people do buildings in pc
plane-crazy 2020-06-07 16:40:30 oh that looks hot as hell
plane-crazy 2020-06-07 16:09:46 that is true
plane-crazy 2020-06-07 16:08:29 i swear
plane-crazy 2020-06-07 16:08:28 thats also how increasing your runway visibility works

plane-crazy 2020-06-05 15:57:48 he keeps on crashing into the ground every single time he tries taking off
plane-crazy 2020-06-05 15:57:12 it doesnt lmao
plane-crazy 2020-06-05 15:56:46 nope
plane-crazy 2020-06-05 15:56:23 
plane-crazy 2020-06-05 15:56:01 the plane hes using looks and flies horribly
plane-crazy 2020-06-05 15:54:09 i hate people like this
plane-crazy 2020-05-31 22:39:25 it does
plane-crazy 2020-05-31 22:38:41 sure, it was a well timed comedy build, but it doesnt deserve 70 upvotes
plane-crazy 2020-05-31 22:38:19 why do builds that actually have effort put into them go so negative and then shit like this gets more than 70 upvotes
plane-crazy 2020-05-31 22:37:26 ok wtf
plane-crazy 2020-05-31 22:27:32 thats actually awesome
plane-crazy 2020-05-31 22:27:15 
plane-crazy 2020-05-31 22:27:07 and i crash right into someone at the exact same time
plane-crazy 2020-05-31 22:26:57 i just went to take a photo of my plane
plane-crazy 2020-05-31 22:26:46 holy shit

plane-crazy 2020-05-20 17:49:39 yes ik i am engris hman
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 17:49:18 the third person needs to tell you who won, since the latency will be the same for both people on their end
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 17:48:51 the people in the vehicles will almost always think they are winning
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 17:48:39 racing in plane crazy is impossible to do if you dont have a third person due to the lag
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 17:47:48 it looks a lot worse than it is, as long as you avoid going parallel to long dips in the terrain, it is really hard to flip over
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 17:43:51 dont even have paint on it yet
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 17:43:44 very much a work in progress

plane-crazy 2020-05-19 21:52:49 why the hell is rick stressing over putting outlines back on blocks
plane-crazy 2020-05-15 18:20:14 can we get this guy chat banned
plane-crazy 2020-05-15 18:20:06 oh my fucking god
plane-crazy 2020-05-13 23:16:57 interesting
plane-crazy 2020-05-13 23:16:55 nothing really *that* crazy is going on
plane-crazy 2020-05-13 23:16:24 it acts as if you were standing in the position of the camera
plane-crazy 2020-05-13 23:15:45 thanks for the help
plane-crazy 2020-05-13 23:15:41 oh wait, now that i think about it that actually was what he did
plane-crazy 2020-05-13 23:14:59 you can only zoom out, not in
plane-crazy 2020-05-13 23:14:51 except
plane-crazy 2020-05-13 23:14:49 ok so it works perfectly
plane-crazy 2020-05-13 23:14:36 actually nvm
plane-crazy 2020-05-13 23:14:15 tried that, nothing of interest happens
plane-crazy 2020-05-13 23:13:18 the camera position gets locked into the last place it was before you switched to the camera view when you do that
plane-crazy 2020-05-13 23:12:19 it produces some odd results while pressing c a split second before jumping out of the chair, but nothing like what he showed in the video
plane-crazy 2020-05-13 23:08:54 anyone know any way to make a camera be able to zoom?
i remember seeing a photo from prototrode/neutronium that showed it being able to do so

plane-crazy 2020-05-09 00:50:10 a10 bad
plane-crazy 2020-05-09 00:21:35 the
plane-crazy 2020-05-09 00:20:48 when you take locked motors just slightly too far
plane-crazy 2020-05-06 15:30:51 i actually quite like this wing design
plane-crazy 2020-05-06 15:28:08 trust me, id love to use motor2s
plane-crazy 2020-05-06 15:26:16 time to work on making the wings *look* decent
plane-crazy 2020-05-06 15:26:03 yeah it flies a good bit better with fewer control surfaces
plane-crazy 2020-05-06 15:23:35 fixed it
plane-crazy 2020-05-06 15:22:54 actually wait
plane-crazy 2020-05-06 15:22:43 if it were facing forwards, it would weld to the part on the locked motors and break it <@!340895447616978954>
plane-crazy 2020-05-06 15:21:53 i just wanted to get it to fly so i could test if it even works lol
plane-crazy 2020-05-06 15:21:37 yeah the wings were pretty much meant to be temporary
plane-crazy 2020-05-06 15:20:12 that might be why its so wobbly
plane-crazy 2020-05-06 15:20:04 hm
plane-crazy 2020-05-06 15:19:04 yeah ok that looks a lot better lmao
definitely going to remove them
plane-crazy 2020-05-06 15:18:18 im probably gonna remove them anyways
plane-crazy 2020-05-06 15:18:05 theyre attached to disconnectors
plane-crazy 2020-05-06 15:17:55 you drop them
plane-crazy 2020-05-06 15:17:52 no

plane-crazy 2020-05-06 15:16:38 first build ive done that uses tons of locked motors, any suggestions?

plane-crazy 2020-04-16 16:14:56 shit youre right
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 16:14:25 ok no but seriously, thats a really hot f4
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 16:14:04 thats obviously an f22
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 16:13:55 yep
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 16:13:47 imagine thinking an f22 is an f18
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 16:13:33 and ok wow
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 16:13:30 just because my build looks good its automatically a tutorial
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 16:13:17 oh i just love those people
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 16:07:43 and thats just so far
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 16:07:28 yeah, nearly 700k people got it
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 16:06:20 i dont think ive ever seen a badge (that wasnt one of those ones that you get for just joining a game) be that high of a percentage
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 16:05:28 50% is a lot of people
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 16:04:20 if they cant do that then they shouldnt have the egg lmao
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 16:04:10 its so easy to get, literally just follow the tutorial and fly over there
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 16:03:35 bruh.
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 16:03:22 its so annoying lol
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 16:03:15 why
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 16:02:59 is the bug where you start with the camera in third person locked mode as apposed to it being unlocked going to be fixed anytime soon? lmao
plane-crazy 2020-04-03 14:38:36 studs per second is roughly equivalent to miles per hour
plane-crazy 2020-04-03 13:02:22 ftnt look up, cool shit
plane-crazy 2020-04-02 18:03:11 extended the wings by 3 blocks, looks more proportionally correct now tbh
plane-crazy 2020-04-02 17:59:14 thats a yikes
plane-crazy 2020-04-02 17:59:10 ok wow
plane-crazy 2020-04-02 17:55:12 the integrated jets make them look a lot shorter
plane-crazy 2020-04-02 17:55:00 honestly i was thinking of extending them
plane-crazy 2020-04-02 17:53:32 bruhm
plane-crazy 2020-04-02 17:53:28 
plane-crazy 2020-04-02 17:52:51 medium jet bomber i made that wasnt modelled after any specific bomber from real life, but ended up looking somewhat like a cold war era one
any ideas, suggestions, or comments?
plane-crazy 2020-03-08 17:31:40 yed
plane-crazy 2020-03-08 17:31:24 if thats a cruiser, thats a really fucking big cruiser

plane-crazy 2020-03-06 13:39:41 no
plane-crazy 2020-01-19 04:05:08 just everything about the f22 is extremely hot
plane-crazy 2020-01-19 04:04:50 also the mach diamonds coming out of the f22
so hot
plane-crazy 2020-01-19 04:04:01 h
plane-crazy 2020-01-19 04:03:12 s
plane-crazy 2020-01-19 04:03:09 ye
plane-crazy 2020-01-19 04:02:24 the elevators are extremely wack now lmao
plane-crazy 2020-01-19 04:02:06 still should go further forwards though
plane-crazy 2020-01-19 04:01:52 definitely better
plane-crazy 2020-01-19 03:55:36 the overall shape is ok i guess
but theyre way too short, dont have anywhere near the proper angling, and are missing 1 of the 2 angle changes at the tip
plane-crazy 2020-01-19 03:53:47 p much
plane-crazy 2020-01-19 03:53:33 and uh yeah
they look nothing like the f22 main wings lmao
plane-crazy 2020-01-19 03:53:00 the main wings and elevators are really misshapen, as has been pointed out multiple times
but besides that its pretty decent
plane-crazy 2020-01-18 21:15:51 hot
plane-crazy 2020-01-18 21:15:46 that even loops perfectly too

plane-crazy 2019-11-06 17:13:36 new part of the proposal:

we feel like this new map would add tons of new replay-ability to the game, encouraging people to make newer, cooler, and faster vehicles to be able to explore easier. on top of that, vehicles that, currently, dont have a big enough map to be used to their full potential, (such as really fast jets, submarines, trains, or huge ships) will now be able to fully explore this new map.
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 17:02:25 alright
made it more clear that were gonna make it
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 17:01:00 the thing is idra, is that were saying that **we** are gonna make it for him.

plane-crazy 2019-06-09 23:39:03 this is the ideal male body. you may not like it, but this is what peak performance looks like.
plane-crazy 2019-06-09 08:21:23 i use them on my reentry vehicle to soften the final fall but thats about it
plane-crazy 2019-06-09 08:17:52 thats some r/nocontext shit right there
plane-crazy 2019-06-09 08:16:45 and katze what i said about wings of glory doesnt show my full opinion on it, i was admittedly being very critical of it
plane-crazy 2019-06-09 08:15:02 bruh what
plane-crazy 2019-06-09 08:14:30 ive only played it for 30 minutes so i cant give an accurate review on it yet
plane-crazy 2019-06-09 08:14:09 i put it under my 'to review' category
plane-crazy 2019-06-09 08:13:55 i played that game the other day
plane-crazy 2019-06-09 08:13:48 yup
plane-crazy 2019-06-09 08:13:20 its a good game, but its unoriginal concept and lackluster selection put it lower on my list
plane-crazy 2019-06-09 08:12:28 i rated it a decent game
plane-crazy 2019-06-09 08:12:00 its on there
plane-crazy 2019-06-09 08:11:34 admittedly
plane-crazy 2019-06-09 08:11:28 a handful basically
plane-crazy 2019-06-09 08:11:20 so
plane-crazy 2019-06-09 08:11:14 maybe with the simulators and those shit games but ive made a list and counted, theres at least 70 good games on this platform
plane-crazy 2019-06-09 08:10:30 uh ok
plane-crazy 2019-06-09 08:10:07 its garbage
plane-crazy 2019-06-09 08:10:04 i dont care how fast it grew
plane-crazy 2019-06-09 08:09:43 super dumb and doesnt deserve the top spot
plane-crazy 2019-06-09 08:09:20 also yeah koneko talked about that game and its pretty much a direct rip of speed simulator 2 with a few things like pets added <@!185171693566689280>
