bug-reports 2019-03-25 21:58:28 alright so im having a really weird one. i have a plane that in non-pvp mode works perfectly fine, but in pvp mode wont lift at all but otherwise functions normally.

creations-chat 2019-12-05 11:40:07 theres so many things wrong with this
bot-central 2019-12-05 23:23:23 !servers
creations-chat 2019-12-07 06:09:22 it looks decent, but theres also plenty of room for improvement
in terms of thrust: id suggest deleting the props of the front of the props and putting a bunch of super rockets somewhere inside the hull
i like what you tried to do with the vertical stabilizer, but it could use some enlargement and just generally more shape put into it
in the longer run, the wing to body ratio is off a little bit, id suggest either (preferably) putting folding wings, but another option is redoing the body entirely. 
in terms of firepower, you could really do with some turrets for your guns. id recommend using a simple and small motor 2 turret, but its up to you
besides that, the body is shaped quite well and the front is fairly well done given your experience level
anyways, hope this helped and good luck! <@!378632050539888651>
creations-chat 2019-12-07 06:10:00 *jeez thats a lot longer than i thought itd end up being*
creations-chat 2019-12-07 16:56:38 oh thats just fucking hot
creations-chat 2019-12-08 07:26:46 this gives me idea
creations-chat 2019-12-09 16:55:30 holy fuck
creations-chat 2019-12-10 19:41:12 wait theres a creations blacklist role?
creations-chat 2019-12-11 01:29:35 did some practice with my new color blending technique, i think it came out fairly decent.
creations-chat 2019-12-11 01:34:20 the top line of black to white got compressed by the saving ðŸ˜”
creations-chat 2019-12-11 02:01:40 yeah
creations-chat 2019-12-11 02:02:18 ooh
creations-chat 2019-12-11 02:02:21 little boat
creations-chat 2019-12-11 02:02:35 yes
creations-chat 2019-12-11 02:03:42 but yeah they got compressed, making the blending much more jagged looking
creations-chat 2019-12-11 02:03:59 luckily the main section is still fine
creations-chat 2019-12-11 02:04:03 yes
creations-chat 2019-12-11 02:04:32 i use rgb and i was like "wahd" cause it goes from 0 to 255
creations-chat 2019-12-11 02:04:56 wh
creations-chat 2019-12-11 02:05:01 oh
creations-chat 2019-12-11 02:05:09 i know what you mean yeah
creations-chat 2019-12-11 02:05:30 generally i use r000g000b000 or hexadecimal
creations-chat 2019-12-11 02:05:58 hex is really good cause its easy to convert back to decimal- oh
creations-chat 2019-12-11 02:06:23 hex is like
creations-chat 2019-12-11 02:06:33 #a0a0a0
creations-chat 2019-12-11 02:06:35 is the code
creations-chat 2019-12-11 02:06:45 for the middle one of the black to white line
creations-chat 2019-12-11 02:06:58 brb
creations-chat 2019-12-11 02:07:55 but yeah
creations-chat 2019-12-11 02:08:35 hex is interesting because each decimal place goes from 0 to f, rather than 0 to 9 for our normal way of writing numbers
creations-chat 2019-12-11 02:09:00 ffffff
creations-chat 2019-12-11 02:09:03 well yes
creations-chat 2019-12-11 02:09:09 wait no
creations-chat 2019-12-11 02:09:20 0f0f0f would be a very light gray
creations-chat 2019-12-11 02:09:28 and aaaaaa would be a medium gray
creations-chat 2019-12-11 02:09:53 yes
creations-chat 2019-12-11 02:09:58 wait no
creations-chat 2019-12-11 02:10:02 im dumb
creations-chat 2019-12-11 02:10:06 thats black
creations-chat 2019-12-11 02:10:16 yes
creations-chat 2019-12-11 02:10:24 i apologize
creations-chat 2019-12-11 02:10:31 yes
creations-chat 2019-12-11 02:11:13 its 15
creations-chat 2019-12-11 02:11:28 final answer
creations-chat 2019-12-11 02:11:42 were talking about hexadecimal
creations-chat 2019-12-11 02:12:09 im approximately 16.87682646575 years old
creations-chat 2019-12-11 02:12:24 *dont ask me why i did the math for that*
creations-chat 2019-12-11 02:12:59 well i was 16.87682646575 at 1:13:30 AM (EST) this morning
creations-chat 2019-12-11 02:13:07 idk what i am now
creations-chat 2019-12-11 02:15:14 idea
creations-chat 2019-12-11 02:15:46 redo it, but with disconnectors
then, push all the disconnectors all together
boom you got super smooth blending
creations-chat 2019-12-11 02:15:55 **i said dont ask**
creations-chat 2019-12-25 02:46:13 pretty good, but 1. some of the proportions are moderately off (height of cockpit, size of tail, etc.) and 2. the livery/camo is odd to say the least
but besides that, id say its got my upvote.
creations-chat 2020-01-16 17:11:06 the plane is pretty damn good, but i agree you should download lightshot or something
creations-chat 2020-02-22 23:21:28 what the hell
creations-chat 2020-02-22 23:21:37 why didnt you crop it
creations-chat 2020-02-25 16:46:35 if the front (green area) was the back of the ship, and the back (tan area) of the ship had any effort put into it, it would be pretty good
creations-chat 2020-02-25 16:53:41 yeah
creations-chat 2020-02-25 16:53:45 thats what im saying
creations-chat 2020-02-25 16:54:12 the curve on it for it being a front is horrid, but if you made it into the back itd be good
creations-chat 2020-02-25 16:55:00 the best thing you could do is rotate the superstructure 180* and make the back the front
creations-chat 2020-02-25 16:56:43 alright

creations-chat 2020-03-08 19:07:19 not bad color blending
turret is a little wack though
creations-chat 2020-03-09 18:09:36 youre 450 studs above ground, its obviously not using hovers
creations-chat 2020-03-09 18:17:44 its a decent build, but you claiming that its a star destroyer is what made people (at least me) downvote it
creations-chat 2020-03-09 18:18:08 when the closest thing it resembles is a space fighter from tc3
creations-chat 2020-03-13 00:23:38 thats actually pretty damn good
creations-chat 2020-03-14 02:16:20 hm
i didnt know you could individually color the little circle bits in the hover engine
creations-chat 2020-03-15 06:15:28 oh my god

creations-chat 2020-03-19 03:01:30 *you downvoted it though*
creations-chat 2020-03-19 03:03:39 m
creations-chat 2020-03-20 17:30:31 i suggest covering the entirety of it with disconnectors, and then coloring them. that way, you can get rid of those horrendous transparent streaks all over the vehicle. you should also delete some of the horizontal wing panels towards the back and replace them with the vertical wing panels so you dont need that tail section

creations-chat 2020-06-09 17:23:06 for the iowa, most of it looks good
but ALL of the proportions are off, it goes too deep into the water, the fuselage is too short, the superstructure is too tall, etc
<@!280393446114590722>
bug-reports 2020-06-30 00:03:22 the part for moving my build around is centered at the world origin when i dont have anything on my plot
not sure what caused it and i havent seen it before, but it doesnt negatively affect gameplay so idk
creations-chat 2020-07-01 03:57:56 <@!707728762841727038> overall id give it a 5.5/10, solid attempt
a lot of the shapes and positioning of the wings, elevators, and rudders are off, and the v shaped ones on the back are too close together
theres no bump near the back of the fuselage, and the general shape of the fuselage is just off

creations-chat 2020-11-21 21:22:59 alright then im gonna downvote it too
because its not clear whatsoever is going on and you dont want to fix that
creations-chat 2020-11-21 21:24:31 alright but its an easy fix to just explain whats going on and you refuse to do that
the build itself is like a 5/10 but that wasnt even your point, and you refuse to make it clear that its not your point
creations-chat 2020-11-21 21:26:10 alright but you didnt explain whats going on in it so no one knew what was even going on in the photo
