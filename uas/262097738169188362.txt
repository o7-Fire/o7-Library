creations-chat 2023-02-05 05:17:16 Like it goes to a blue screen when i have rbx fps unlocker to uncapped, then the fans go to full speed and then it blue screens
creations-chat 2023-02-05 05:19:23 If i have it capped at 144, the fans dont go to full speed and it doesnt crash
Only roblox has crashed my laptop, i run valorant at 200 fps and other games at that same frame gap too
no i dont hear a buzzing sound its just the fan going really fast
if it was a buzzing sound it would be very noticeable
creations-chat 2023-02-05 05:21:47 The fans dont go that fast when im running valorant or scrap mechanic at uncapped fps
I'll try to clean my laptop fans but other than that roblox legit just crashes my whole laptop for no reason
it crashes when roblox is at uncapped fps so probably pushing to its limit
