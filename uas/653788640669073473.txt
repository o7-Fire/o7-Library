creations-chat 2021-05-20 17:22:19 Prolly bc we don't know it's your 3rd build. Besides we ain't gonna upvote if it don't look good 

Dead honest if you expect us to upvote because it's your 3rd build you got something coming dude

creations-chat 2021-08-17 16:24:17 <@777507202814050344> wings are too long. Take an overhead view of the A10 and place it over the build. It'll help you get a more accurate build
