creations-chat 2021-09-07 17:14:11 i made something like u did but with a working gearbox i recommend using hoverengines instead of rockets. u have to place blocks around it to spin but i think its better for such a light car
creations-chat 2021-09-07 17:16:14 the hoverengine's behavior are sometimes more realistic than rocket but sometimes rockets are better. so u would have to test different things
creations-chat 2021-09-07 19:25:19 its like a pc fan inside the hoverengines and on the outside blocks that dont rotate
help 2021-09-08 10:02:04 to get an creation into the hall of fame i have to get over 100 upvotes on it. Is it important when i posted it?

creations-chat 2023-01-09 12:10:42 so i have 2 f1 cars with crash physics. one is kindda small and the other one is big. the bigger one doesnt have crash physics on the wheels yet bc its wip and the smaller one has crash physics. i didnt add completely detachable wheels bc irl they have like a rope that holds the wheels when the suspension breaks so the wheel cant just fly away and hit something
creations-chat 2023-01-09 12:16:13 before they started using that rope on f1 cars the wheels would just disconnect from the car when the suspension breaks of a crash and if its a high speed crash the wheels often were just rolling somewhere and could hit another car or something

senna's steering failed mid turn and thats y he hit the wall
creations-chat 2023-01-09 12:21:27 yea the rope was introduced in 2017 or something
creations-chat 2023-01-09 12:24:57 i dont like the codemasters f1 games. i play sims like assetto corsa. there are f1 cars like the f2004 in it with realistic handling. the f1 games from codemasters are basically just arcade games
