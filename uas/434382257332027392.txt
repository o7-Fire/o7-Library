bot-central 2020-03-27 10:32:31 &suggest Hello,
I have a suggestion. In plane crazy, there's one main pilot seat and several normal pilot seats. normal pilot seats are useless, you can't control anything with them. It would be nice to add a tool to connect one or more engines to one of the seats.  For example, if a person wants to build an aircraft carrier, he can build his aircraft carrier and put his main control seat on it, but he won't be able to build aircraft on it because the main pilot seat controls everything. So it would be nice to use a normal pilot's seat to connect it with the engines that are needed. That way the person can connect the engines of his plane to his normal control seat. The engines on the carrier will be controlled by the main control seat.
Thank you for reading me.
