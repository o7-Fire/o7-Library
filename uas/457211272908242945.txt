creations-chat 2020-03-12 08:40:54 <@456226577798135808>thx for the input
creations-chat 2020-03-12 13:35:26 <@!503108213932032000> i used several delta wings
creations-chat 2020-03-12 13:35:49 i need to make the wings in the back smaller
creations-chat 2020-03-12 13:37:22 but thats pretty much all i personally want to change about my b52 i like how i was able to get a decent replica keyword was decent that small without losing any functionality
creations-chat 2020-03-12 13:48:30 <@!503108213932032000> its around the size of a light tank
creations-chat 2020-03-12 13:48:49 chasis*
creations-chat 2020-03-12 13:51:23 110 studs per second is average speed for land vehicles that dont use wheels
creations-chat 2020-03-12 13:51:43 wait that has wheels
creations-chat 2020-03-12 13:51:54 why is it so slow
creations-chat 2020-03-12 13:52:16 where is a hover car
creations-chat 2020-03-12 13:52:45 <@!509641743570829312> ???
creations-chat 2020-03-12 13:52:58 thats not why im confused
creations-chat 2020-03-12 13:53:58 the motor speed is a no brainer
creations-chat 2020-03-12 13:54:07 im sure he did that already
creations-chat 2020-03-12 13:54:47 <@!238017332872478720> why u always change your pfp
creations-chat 2020-03-12 13:55:37 <@!503108213932032000> the tank you made is a heavy tank
creations-chat 2020-03-12 13:55:49 judging by the turret
creations-chat 2020-03-12 13:56:00 so it should be considerably larger
creations-chat 2020-03-12 13:56:06 than it is
creations-chat 2020-03-12 13:56:36 have you seen a tank irl
creations-chat 2020-03-12 13:56:47 they are huge
creations-chat 2020-03-12 13:57:00 mhm
creations-chat 2020-03-12 13:57:34 make a taller turret and it will look more like a medium or light tank
creations-chat 2020-03-12 13:58:48 that tank above you is probably closer to irl size
creations-chat 2020-03-12 13:58:55 just letting you know
creations-chat 2020-03-12 13:59:24 look at that tank above you
creations-chat 2020-03-12 14:00:29 yea
creations-chat 2020-03-12 14:01:17 look at the non rusty version
creations-chat 2020-03-12 14:01:41 thats what the tank with you tanks turret should look like
creations-chat 2020-03-12 14:02:26 ok its your tank
creations-chat 2020-03-12 14:02:37 at the end of the day you decide what you do with it

the-dump 2020-11-15 14:52:30 well you see to interpret as nsfw you have to have pre existing knowledge of the type of fight
the-dump 2020-11-15 14:52:43 ohh well
the-dump 2020-11-15 14:53:01 its been in 4 other servers that have no nsfw meme rules
the-dump 2020-11-15 14:53:31 no i mean like nsfw isnt allowed in the servers
the-dump 2020-11-15 14:53:49 they found the meme acceptable
the-dump 2020-11-15 14:54:17 due to the fact that it cant be viewed as nsfw unless you actually have knowledge of that area
the-dump 2020-11-15 14:54:22 apparently not
