plane-crazy 2020-07-17 00:14:25 But what I do know is that it has nothing to do with the game.
plane-crazy 2020-07-17 00:14:12 I don't know
plane-crazy 2020-07-17 00:07:43 Chassis I've developed for a turret.
plane-crazy 2020-07-09 21:42:33 turret after 3 minutes of attack
plane-crazy 2020-07-09 21:27:29 What  does damping on suspension do?
plane-crazy 2020-07-09 17:44:39 This is why the turret is chunky.

plane-crazy 2020-07-09 17:41:13 
plane-crazy 2020-07-09 17:38:15 Tnt armor?
plane-crazy 2020-07-09 17:36:36 My goal isn't to make a pretty tank, my goal is to make a tank that actually has the characteristics that tanks are designed for.
plane-crazy 2020-07-09 17:34:12 That'll decrease the fighting effectiveness of the turret by decreasing the armor.
plane-crazy 2020-07-09 17:33:42 What good will that do?
plane-crazy 2020-07-09 17:32:32 But the turret is supposed to be used in combat
plane-crazy 2020-07-09 17:31:37 For the track?
plane-crazy 2020-07-09 17:30:52 Which will be used to mount this turret.
plane-crazy 2020-07-09 17:30:37 Any ideas for a track design for this chassis?
plane-crazy 2020-06-21 03:17:31 How do you fire a gun?
plane-crazy 2020-06-18 05:21:47 This is probably going to be the most heavily armored vehicle ever made in this game
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 16:45:05 how can I prevent this from detracking as it falls?

plane-crazy 2019-09-21 18:51:30 ----------
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 00:55:05 I think the name specifies it enough.
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 00:54:46 "unspecified"
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 00:54:34 LOL
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 00:54:04 I love how I continue to get updated messages on discord while google says there's no internet.
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 00:51:38 it's i
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 00:48:52 Anyone know any kind of suspension that would be able to handle loads of 6800 blocks?
plane-crazy 2019-08-30 03:27:45 I could probably inch out a bit more speed by increasing the motors from a speed of 20 to 50
plane-crazy 2019-08-30 03:25:58 This is the link to the speed test of the super heavy tank: https://screencast-o-matic.com/watch/cqjUFdt0e9
plane-crazy 2019-08-30 03:25:07 Which is crucial when your tank towers above everybody else.
plane-crazy 2019-08-30 03:24:50 The turret needs to be big to have good gun depression.
plane-crazy 2019-08-30 03:23:39 Can I post a link to the video?
plane-crazy 2019-08-30 03:23:11 I have a video example of the test
plane-crazy 2019-08-30 03:23:06 I used the rockets to keep the tank on the ground, so that all the moving wheels stayed in contact with the ground and thus actually contributed to the speed.
plane-crazy 2019-08-30 03:22:03 I did use a bunch of rocket in the test in which it went to that speed however, not in the way that you think.
plane-crazy 2019-08-30 03:21:14 it takes a while to accelerate but it can reach a speed above 400
plane-crazy 2019-08-30 03:20:29 They are all damaged the same
plane-crazy 2019-08-30 03:20:23 Blocks are blocks
plane-crazy 2019-08-30 03:20:14 There is no armor.
plane-crazy 2019-08-30 03:20:07 I know
plane-crazy 2019-08-30 03:19:44 Frontal view of the tank
plane-crazy 2019-08-30 03:18:19 It fires a salvo of 4 missiles.
plane-crazy 2019-08-30 03:17:40 Actually angling the thing wouldn't do anything in this game.
plane-crazy 2019-08-30 03:16:56 negative ricochet?
plane-crazy 2019-08-30 03:15:54 a
plane-crazy 2019-08-30 03:15:30 I could make reduce the height of the turret, but that would impair gun depression.
plane-crazy 2019-08-30 03:15:04 I can make the turret shorter, but in turn would be compromising armor.
plane-crazy 2019-08-30 03:14:20 the entire structure is 6815 blocks
plane-crazy 2019-08-30 03:14:09 the chassis is only ~2500 blocks
plane-crazy 2019-08-30 03:13:54 it does
plane-crazy 2019-08-30 03:13:28 Any design change suggestions?
plane-crazy 2019-08-30 03:13:19 Anyways
plane-crazy 2019-08-30 03:12:32 Acer is not known for their beautiful screens
plane-crazy 2019-08-30 03:11:51 Any design change suggestions for my super heavy tank?
plane-crazy 2019-08-29 19:05:55 It would save weight and thus add more speed and acceleration. However this would come at the cost of gun depression and elevation.
plane-crazy 2019-08-29 19:05:11 Should I reduce the turret height?
plane-crazy 2019-08-29 19:00:38 The main problem is that giant land vehicles like to pretend that gravity doesn't exist.
plane-crazy 2019-08-29 18:58:35 Which is of great annoyance to me. Because when the tank is in the air it's wheels aren't making contact with the ground and accelerating it further.
plane-crazy 2019-08-29 18:57:47 technically when the tank is offroading it spends most of its time in the air.
plane-crazy 2019-08-29 18:57:07 No I mean I literally drove it off the spawn area and into the void.
plane-crazy 2019-08-29 18:55:44 It reached about 430 speed before I ran out of road to drive it on.
plane-crazy 2019-08-29 18:54:53 I figured out I could drastically increase the speed by using the rockets as a downwards force on the tank. For instance, when the tank is on the move, it usually for some reason leans backwards to where only its hind wheels are touching the ground. But through the use of rockets I was able to keep all the wheels on the ground and thus take full advantage of the 98 motors powering the tank.
plane-crazy 2019-08-29 18:52:33 Well I got a recording of my tank in action: https://screencast-o-matic.com/watch/cqjUFdt0e9
plane-crazy 2019-08-29 18:07:08 it's alright for a 6800 block vehicle
plane-crazy 2019-08-29 18:06:52 Problem is that it didn't stay on the ground.
plane-crazy 2019-08-29 18:06:22 I strapped around 60 super rockets to the tank about 15 minutes ago, it took a while to accelerate but supposedly reached a speed of 413.
plane-crazy 2019-08-29 18:03:58 The tank was able to withstand a barrage of around 18 rockets without having any crucial parts damaged.
plane-crazy 2019-08-29 18:03:02 The tank is pretty slow, but from combat tests, it's shown to be pretty resilent.
plane-crazy 2019-08-29 18:01:09 it's about 6800 blocks right now. So
plane-crazy 2019-08-29 18:00:34 Mine is a super heavy tank
plane-crazy 2019-08-29 18:00:02 That's the best option?
plane-crazy 2019-08-29 17:59:42 Any ideas on how to make giant vehicles accelerate quickly?
plane-crazy 2019-08-29 17:52:43 Hmm it appears that adding more wheels to a tank does not increase speed, despite the total power output being more.
plane-crazy 2019-08-28 02:58:00 Does ice reduce friction?
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 20:15:12 Correct?
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 20:14:55 So generally the larger something is, the slower it will be even if it has the same power to weight ratio?
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 20:08:54 oh
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 20:08:27 so adding a pointed nose to an aircraft will make it go faster?
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 20:07:44 Is drag a mechanic in the game?
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 20:02:57 is drag a mechanic in this game?
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:49:16 What's the current speed record for any vehicle in the game?
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 00:59:37 Can propeller blades be used as spoilers?
plane-crazy 2019-07-22 02:12:53 Are bomber planes the deadliest vehicles in game?
plane-crazy 2019-07-22 01:41:17 It’s just not worth it
plane-crazy 2019-07-22 01:41:10 I give up. I’m going to need to slap like 20 jet engines onto that 2431 block tank in order to make it fly
plane-crazy 2019-07-22 01:38:19 It looks like a rover now
plane-crazy 2019-07-22 01:36:04 Why does a tank that moves at 684 speed on the ground need to fly to be considered fast?
plane-crazy 2019-07-22 01:35:26 This is stupid
plane-crazy 2019-07-22 01:35:05 I can’t believe I’m actually trying to make a tank fly
plane-crazy 2019-07-22 01:12:12 It would just expose the unarmored underbelly of the tank
plane-crazy 2019-07-22 01:11:21 But why would I want my tank to fly?
plane-crazy 2019-07-22 01:09:59 What is considered a fast speed for a a tank?
plane-crazy 2019-07-22 00:44:20 I’mma have to increase the width of the tank then if I’m going to make it any faster
plane-crazy 2019-07-22 00:41:22 Well rip
plane-crazy 2019-07-22 00:41:01 No
plane-crazy 2019-07-22 00:40:43 Is 684 fast for a tank?
plane-crazy 2019-07-22 00:00:27 Is it a known glitch for tnt to not work in pvp mode?
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 23:45:11 PvP is on
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 23:45:05 Yes
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 23:44:50 And does no damage to its surroundings
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 23:44:38 The tnt just expodes
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 23:44:24 Welp from my tests I’ve learned that my missiles do no damage
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 23:17:12 You can come see for yourself, I don’t have half tnt
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 23:15:37 No I don’t
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 23:15:25 Yes
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 23:15:21 I didn’t
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 23:14:34 It does use controls surfaces
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 23:13:42 Missile so far
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 23:00:41 Yes or no?
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 23:00:10 So that means my missile also has to tilt to turn
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 22:59:32 So basically do all planes in this game have to tilt to turn?
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 22:59:06 So basically do all planes in this game have to tilt to turn?
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 21:42:35 They lean forward
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 21:42:14 But the problem is the missiles are not well designed
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 21:41:55 I know that
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 21:41:12 Does anyone have a good guided missile design they’re willing to share? I’m not very fond of reinventing the wheel.
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 05:28:40 yus
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 05:27:24 Panzernoobwagen
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 05:26:39 Oof
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 05:25:27 around half the people would be defenseless because the only thing they brought to the battle would be a stationary noob turret.
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 05:24:31 Those who only have ground vehicles
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 05:23:44 The ground vehicles would have a difficult time crossing the rugged and mountainous terrain surrounding the ocean
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 05:22:59 However.
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 05:18:47 I think a stealth submarine would be on of the most lethal vehicles in pvp. All that one would have to do is spawn, submerge, move out a bit, and then proceed to one shot everybody from beyond their visual range with guided missiles launched from under water.
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 05:08:18 Do people use magnets to attach their ships together?
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 05:06:55 Ah
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 05:06:31 No need to be so salty
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 05:06:12 With 30 guided missiles.
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 05:05:37 An attack stealth submarine
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 05:05:23 I have one last idea
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 04:57:38 What moves around 200 over land only moves 12 in water
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 04:57:11 Welp propellers turn out to be very ineffective. I was way in over my head.
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 03:21:30 What is considered a fast speed for a ship?
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 03:15:53 I'm going at a speed of 52 on land on my barely built ship
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 02:45:02 Pretty stronk
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 02:44:41 Ok my 60,000 torque power engine is complete.
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 02:27:17 I fixed the engine by adding more supports
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 02:03:53 the engine fell apart
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 02:03:50 It's too powerful
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 01:56:47 I swear if this boat takes off the ground during testing
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 01:56:10 You can run 100 motors with no problem if you have a good computer
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 01:55:10 Your right I'll make it 64 motors
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 01:54:50 This is probably already going to be one of the fastest boats ever built.
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 01:54:08 You sure?
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 01:53:45 I'm now making it  48 motor engine
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 01:53:25 Exactly
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 01:52:52 high
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 01:52:48 Now there's a tiny cylinder in the middle surrounded by large cylinders
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 01:52:27 So I reversed it
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 01:52:18 the smaller cylinders actually don't move as fast the exterior of the large cylinders
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 01:51:56 But realized a fatal flaw
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 01:51:51 Yes that's exactly what I did
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 01:39:16 Then technically it's just a bunch of tiny engines instead of a single engine.
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 01:34:39 And do the rockets move a propeller?
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 01:33:05 Hopefully it turns out to be the most powerful ship engine ever built.
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 01:32:31 Contrary to what I was told, my ship engine does work. I'm going to lengthen it and put a 1 by 1 cylinder in the middle and 3 by 3 cylinders around it to every increase it's power.
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 01:17:15 Teleport area 51 to the end problem solved
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 01:09:32 Wait so I use wing panels for a propeller?
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 00:47:54 Such precision
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 00:44:34 That's what a I mean
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 00:41:44 Can someone send me a picture of a propeller on a ship in this game?
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 00:32:51 put does it walk?
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 00:32:31 how are you going to fold it up to fit inside a rocket
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 00:32:15 It's highly inpractical\
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 00:30:47 pls add tracks
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 00:30:09 so h0t
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 00:29:51 h0t
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 00:28:49 They Tiger I is the ideal female body.
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 00:28:13 cute
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 00:22:11 I haven't build a single thing with one since the plane tutorial that I went through when I first joined.
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 00:21:45 Can somebody show me how the hell to build a boat propeller?
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 00:21:06 But first
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 00:17:14 I twill succeed because I will use cloth cylinder as gears
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 00:16:56 No
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 00:14:37 *35*
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 00:14:25 It will have a single propeller powered by 28 motors.
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 00:14:11 I'mma try to make the fastest boat in the game
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 00:10:00 No potato computers allowed
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 00:09:44 Anyone want to see my tank in action?
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 00:08:55 tank meeting?
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 00:05:58 How does this even float
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 00:05:56 
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 00:03:54 That is when it's in the water
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 00:03:38 and mostly it's jsut 3
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 00:03:34 only problem is that it moves at a max of 8 mph
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 00:03:09 I made my tank amphibious
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 23:53:08 Take in mind that it's lik 243 blocks i nsize
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 23:52:38 For a brief period my tank reached 692 speed
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 23:46:03 Reached 684 before the road stopped.
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 23:45:58 Did a speed  test.
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 23:25:59 Anyone know why my suspension keeps bunching up?
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 23:15:25 Should I put 10 torque on each motor with this vehicle?
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 23:00:04 So what happens when you add too much torque?
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 22:57:27 what is immune to gunfire?
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 22:57:13 Ok so repeat again
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 22:54:05 That would look ugly
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 22:53:55 There isn't any to the extent of my knowledge
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 22:53:30 That's why it needs to be 15 blocks thick
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 22:53:17 Because it's a damn tank
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 22:52:59 with 15 block thick frontal armor
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 22:52:48 But I intend to make it heavily armored
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 22:52:20 It was originally powered by 3 motors per wheel
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 22:51:53 But it doesn't actually appear to go that fast
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 22:51:17 This goes 363 over rough terrain
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 22:50:57 Seeing a large vehicle move at fast speeds
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 22:50:47 I was hoping it would spread terror in the eyes of people.
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 22:50:25 104 total
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 22:50:13 For speed
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 22:50:05 *7*
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 22:49:41 What would be the ideal torque for this?
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 22:48:31 So anyways what would you suggest I use to keep my tank on the ground?
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 22:45:35 It's now a big cat
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 22:45:31 h0t
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 22:45:08 What would you suggest I use for down force?
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 22:44:18 This thing moves at "363" sps
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 22:35:26 I guess giant vehicles can't move at a fast speed no matter how good their suspension is and how high of a power to weight ratio they have
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 22:34:03 
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 22:32:58 wait wrong picture
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 22:32:44 This thing drives surprisingly slow considering that it's powered by 104 motors
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 06:07:41 Why are we listening to this?

plane-crazy 2019-07-20 05:36:54 It was great.
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 05:36:46 And we did right in front of all the girls involved in the volunteer effort
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 05:36:26 And toto africa just started playing and someone decided to blast it.
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 05:36:09 We ran out of work to do and were riding in the back of a track so we just went into the parking while have the radio on.
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 05:35:21 It reminds me the time I was doing community service along with other people in my school helping clean up debris left by irma
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 05:34:43 Toto aafrica brings back good memories
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 05:24:21 My ears are crying red tears of joy.
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 05:22:52 But sleep is for the weak
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 05:22:46 I'm going to be doing community service at 8:30ish AM
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 05:21:59 Ok then, I'll just slap the turret on at the very back.
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 05:19:26 What would you consider a thick armor plate in this game>
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 05:15:18 Deja vu?
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 05:03:50 yes meme music
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 04:46:13 Should I play Thanos talks to you about his plans, but he's on a lunch break with some fresh KFC.?
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 04:44:30 what is this
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 04:44:28 XD
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 04:42:23 funkerlied is bettr
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 04:41:56 Erika
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 04:41:51 My little darling.
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 04:41:41 But I do love Erika
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 04:41:35 who did this?
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 04:41:32 even more german music
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 04:41:03 Which coincidental because I'm wearing a uniform for a Germany military group right now.
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 04:40:18 Now we're listening Germany music
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 04:39:55 It's not even dank
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 04:38:59 what the hell am I listening to?
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 04:38:31 I'm back
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 04:28:47 and a giant survival world
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 04:28:28 I built a 238 block long cruise ship
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 04:28:20 I used to play PE so much
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 04:24:58 Somebody once told me the world is going to roll me.
I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed.
She was lookin' kinda dumb with her finger and her thumb in the shape of an L on her forehead.
Hey, now you're a RUSSIAN
Sing to our Motherland, Free and Undying,
Get your gun on, go shot, go nuke on
Bulwark of Peoples in Brotherhood Strong!
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 04:23:46 In Soviet Russia, only mold breaks the shooting stars.
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 04:23:21 I CAME BACK PUT ON ME HEAPHOENS AND HEAR THIS GLORIOUS MUSIC
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 04:23:07 BEAUTIFUL
I
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 04:23:04 YES
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 04:10:32 Is this s3rl?
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 04:03:59 yes
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 04:02:17 In my opinion at least.
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 04:02:01 This is gold
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 04:01:40 XDXD
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 04:00:54 I'll take that as a yes.
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 04:00:21 Is it ok if I play cancerous material in top tunes?
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 03:59:11 *grabs popcorn*
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 03:58:28 Should I play next on the turbofan?
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 03:58:13 Hmm
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 03:57:49 now
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 03:57:48 I back down
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 03:57:45 n0t really
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 03:57:08 So your not just paying for the phone but also the services.
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 03:56:57 But an iphone comes with more years of updates than a samsung or android.
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 03:56:16 the final frontier
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 03:56:12 space
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 03:38:55 So the user's hands will probably be all over the place when they're fighting.
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 03:38:17 It's a sarcastic joke referring to how each of those 12 rockets probably has a firing key.
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 03:37:41 yes
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 03:37:00 I bet that rocket truck has a keybinding for antz
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 03:13:11 spinning
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 03:04:36 This was coincidence a swear
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 03:04:17 
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 03:04:04 lol
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 03:03:37 My dream of building a fast heavy tank with a functional reloading cannon that 1 shots everything in sight is dead.
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 03:02:53 And I know there is no way to do this.
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 03:02:42 I know what I'm doing
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 03:02:37 No
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 02:59:37 The rounds are then pushed into the gun breach via a compact piston.
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 02:59:22 the magnets pull on each other and that causes the loose wall portion at the bottom to push the tnt round into the feeding area.
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 02:58:19 There are magnets on both sides
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 02:57:34 This is the closest I ever got to a functional compact magazine.
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 02:55:50 exactly
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 02:54:25 Another problem with that concept is if you had lets say 9 barrels, it would require 9 separate keys to fire them individually.
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 02:53:20 nothing
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 02:53:05 If you wanted a lot of shots.
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 02:52:56 But that would require a lot of barrels.
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 02:51:44 And I spent around 2 days of gameplay developing this, to carry a large magazine for a giant cannon.
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 02:50:19 I mean theoretically you could make a magazine that could do the job without detonating the shells, but the magazine would have to be so large that you couldn't even fit it on the largest of chasses.
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 02:48:31 Because it's not so much loading that's hard but rather it's having the shells move inside a compact magazine without detonating.
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 02:47:44 And by designs I mean magazines.
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 02:46:57 Oh I've gone through at least 5 different designs
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 02:46:41 So I'm working on this "tiny" thing.
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 02:45:29 they all detonated prematurely.
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 02:45:17 And I've spent at least 10 hours trying to develop one to no avail.
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 02:44:33 One after the other
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 02:44:23 No matter what kind of magazine you make, no matter how pressure insensitive you make the tnt rounds, they will always set of while still in magazine and destroy everything.
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 02:43:19 I've concluded that making a cannon that fires multiple tnt rounds is not feasible.
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 02:42:51 I've returned
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 02:42:47 Well.
plane-crazy 2019-06-09 19:07:46 I now get like double the vertical traversion.
plane-crazy 2019-06-09 19:07:31 Ok I've fixed the transmission
plane-crazy 2019-06-09 18:49:52 This could go 3-4 times faster if it had a suspension system that gave the wheels more horizontal transitional freedom.
plane-crazy 2019-06-09 18:36:33 those wheels tho
plane-crazy 2019-06-09 18:36:11 gae
plane-crazy 2019-06-09 18:35:58 If only someone developed a transmission for my tank. That way  I could just use a single rotating drive wheel to move the tank.
plane-crazy 2019-06-09 18:33:47 tank chassis traversing train tracks like it's nothing
plane-crazy 2019-06-09 18:32:15 It uses a opposite attraction magnet magazine.
plane-crazy 2019-06-09 18:31:55 Problem is it fires one or two shots and then explodes.
plane-crazy 2019-06-09 18:31:43 this is the prototype cannon I've been working on
plane-crazy 2019-06-09 18:31:02 as of now, I am developing the only chassis large enough for proper functional cannons
plane-crazy 2019-06-09 18:30:19 264 max
plane-crazy 2019-06-09 18:30:16 provided it has the right suspensions
plane-crazy 2019-06-09 18:30:03 it moves as fast as small tanks
plane-crazy 2019-06-09 18:29:55 It actually has great speed
plane-crazy 2019-06-09 18:29:25 Exactly, that's why interleaved roadwheels are the way to go
plane-crazy 2019-06-09 18:27:42 The perfect large vehicle wheel, combing a smooth ride with sufficient armor.
plane-crazy 2019-06-09 18:06:31 meaning it's not a ground vehicle
plane-crazy 2019-06-09 18:06:24 because if it doesn't have wheels or treads, it doesn't touch the ground.
plane-crazy 2019-06-09 18:04:54 if your vehicle does noe allow the wheels to have high vertical traverse, you will get horrible speed.
plane-crazy 2019-06-09 18:04:15 I've done some testing and I've concluded that suspension by far plays the biggest role is the speed of large ground vehicles
plane-crazy 2019-06-09 17:34:23 
plane-crazy 2019-06-09 17:29:53 
plane-crazy 2019-06-09 17:23:00 I spent like 2 days worth of gameplay for nothing
plane-crazy 2019-06-09 17:20:19 I've just come to accept the fact that I'll never be able to drive my beloved creation.
plane-crazy 2019-05-31 02:52:04 Ogres are like onion they have layers.
plane-crazy 2019-05-31 02:50:58 I'm in a Shrek cult
plane-crazy 2019-05-31 02:50:30 Shrek is love Shrek is life
plane-crazy 2019-05-31 02:50:24 [no
plane-crazy 2019-05-31 02:49:44 So rocket propelled torpedoes would probably work?
plane-crazy 2019-05-31 02:49:08 Do  rockets work under water?
plane-crazy 2019-05-31 02:36:07 do rockets work underwater in this game?
plane-crazy 2019-05-31 02:19:21 And everything I have made so far blows up.
plane-crazy 2019-05-31 02:19:13 Because I need a compacte tnt shell magazine that doesn't blow up
plane-crazy 2019-05-31 02:18:19 Has anyone developed a compact tnt shell magazine that doesn't prematurely detonate the shells and cause everything to blow up?
plane-crazy 2019-05-30 01:14:08 But preferably it ISN'T tall af.
plane-crazy 2019-05-30 01:13:59 not really
plane-crazy 2019-05-30 01:09:17 Whoever is the  first to develop a fully function breach cannon and magazine pretty much is the Einstein of plane crazy.
plane-crazy 2019-05-30 01:08:35 Exactly
plane-crazy 2019-05-30 01:06:19 Developing the breach loading cannon in this game is like developing a nuclear bomb. It takes a lot of time and development.
plane-crazy 2019-05-30 01:04:25 That is if you want to shoot 5 block long shells.
plane-crazy 2019-05-30 01:03:55 This is as small as it gets.
plane-crazy 2019-05-30 01:03:44 Oh yah no.
plane-crazy 2019-05-30 01:02:27 You can though in terms of height.
plane-crazy 2019-05-30 01:00:45 Instead of just the cannon.
plane-crazy 2019-05-30 01:00:15 But if you extend the magazine sideways you won't have any problems because turrets always  move their cannons horizontally by  turning the entire turret.
plane-crazy 2019-05-30 00:58:51 Which makes the already massive vehicle that this would be mounted on have an even bigger profile.
plane-crazy 2019-05-30 00:58:20 If you make the  magazine too long or too tall you won't have much gun depression without making the turret very tall.
plane-crazy 2019-05-30 00:56:57 In my design the magazine is located on the side because that is the ideal position.
plane-crazy 2019-05-30 00:56:34 The problem with that design is dimensions.
plane-crazy 2019-05-30 00:51:43 This is hotter
plane-crazy 2019-05-30 00:50:26 They all seem satisfied with useless prop cannons.
plane-crazy 2019-05-30 00:50:01 Sadly nobody seems to be interested in making functional cannons.
plane-crazy 2019-05-30 00:49:27 The actual back.
plane-crazy 2019-05-30 00:49:20 It's the only way to make a cannon capable of firing multiple times.
plane-crazy 2019-05-30 00:48:38 A cannon that is loaded from the breach (the back of the cannon).
plane-crazy 2019-05-30 00:44:56 And it  still explodes
plane-crazy 2019-05-30 00:43:49 The sad thing is this is probably the most functional breach loading cannon that has been developed so far.
plane-crazy 2019-05-30 00:43:09 I like Terrains
plane-crazy 2019-05-30 00:43:06 No
plane-crazy 2019-05-30 00:42:27 Progress update on compact breach-loading cannon development. The entire contraption detonates when the piston moves while the magnets that move the ammunition are on.
plane-crazy 2019-05-29 23:44:50 I wonder when the physics enacting before the creation spawns glitch will be fixed
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 22:26:16 oh wait
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 22:25:59 Anyone know any compact mechanism that I can use to  move the bolt (the grey thing) back and forth?
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 21:44:49 With the development of the compact magazine, using multi-shot cannons that fire tnt blocks will become practical for the first time
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 21:43:04 I think I am getting very close to developing the first compact tnt block shell magazine.
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 12:28:42 That fires tnt rounds that is.
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 12:28:19 Has anyone successfully built a cannon with a magazine?
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 01:50:14 Isn't this a beautiful piece of engineering?
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 01:46:45 It's called accidentally falling off the edge of the map in your giant tank
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 01:45:53 I've conducted some more experiments on magnet powered magazines
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 04:11:38 
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 04:11:27 whenever I try this happens
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 04:10:32 OOf I can spawn my vehicle properly because my wifi is too bad
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 03:41:28 When you only have upload speeds of 1.4 megabytes per second and you try to load something
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 00:51:58 oh thanks
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 00:49:41 
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 00:48:36 HOW?
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 00:48:20 so I don't have to click on each block to set it to 0.15
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 00:48:04 I wish I could place ballast blocks down with custom settings already on them
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 00:41:58 I wonder what for
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 00:41:53 wait I checked my rank and realize that I got a warning
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 00:38:30 good meme good meme
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 00:38:13 ..
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 00:25:47 Has anyone invented a compact reloadable tnt cannon yet?
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 00:24:38 All I have to do I get the tank to the hills and go in a hull down position
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 00:24:21 Nah
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 00:23:59 It will fire 4-5 block tnt shells that will 1 shot all of those noob turrets and have a ball machine gun also built into the turret.
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 00:23:15 I expect it to be to the most combat effective tank in the game when it's done.
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 00:22:44 I've been working on this specific tank model for at least 20 hours
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 00:22:13 who?
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 00:20:37 With the implemenation of ballast blocks to lighten the frame of the tank by 33% and the use of frictions blocks I expect there to be an considerable increase in the speed of my tank.
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 00:15:33 <@!486674992981999648> Thanks your a life saver.
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 00:13:22 Hopefully he'll add friction slabs and wedges soon
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 00:11:23 and that most of the torque generated my motors is being wasted.
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 00:10:48 Which means my tank will continue to slide a lot and be very hard to control.
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 00:10:32 no I mean that my wheels won't have a lot of friction
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 00:08:49 So have virtually nowhere to put the  friction blocks on.
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 00:08:33 It's a bad thing that all my tank's wheels use half blocks around the exterior
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 00:07:59 Oof
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 00:07:49 So they make wheels more efficient?
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 00:07:06 YES
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 00:06:45 What is the use of friction blocks??
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 00:05:15 yes or no?
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 00:04:45 So do friction blocks make wheels more effecient?
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 00:03:49 so they make wheels more efficient?
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 00:02:59 What do friction blocks do?
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 00:46:14 or somewhere around there
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 00:45:58 Just the wheels of my tank take up 1200 blocks
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 00:43:31 I'm using discord on google
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 00:43:17 too bad
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 00:42:12 *snipping*
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 00:41:55 so use the sniping tool
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 00:41:21 send a screenshot
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 00:40:57 My tank is slow
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 00:40:35 I could really use something around the lines of that
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 00:40:06 You sure it isn't the motors that break?
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 00:39:18 with what?!?!?
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 00:39:01 How the hell do you break wheels?
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 00:36:21 So ballast beams at minimum density weigh as much as a normal 4 block beam right?
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 00:34:33 What's with the downvotes?
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 00:33:25 RIP me
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 00:32:56 Welp now I gotta replace almost every block in this tank with a ballast block (Ballast blocks specifically since they can have density as low as 0.15 while ballast beam can only go as low as 0.28) out of hopes that I can increase the speed of this tank by around 30-40%.
plane-crazy 2019-05-04 21:30:01 who?
plane-crazy 2019-05-04 21:28:23 Do you think I'll see a considerable increase in the speed of my tank if Replace ~2000 out of 2896 blocks with  ballast blocks set to 0.15 weight?
plane-crazy 2019-05-04 21:28:03 Why?
plane-crazy 2019-05-04 21:26:19 why  you say that?
plane-crazy 2019-05-04 21:25:38 Do you think I'll see a considerable increase in the speed of my tank if Replace ~2000 out of 2896 blocks with  ballast blocks set to 0.15 weight?
plane-crazy 2019-05-04 04:55:19 but my dream will
plane-crazy 2019-05-04 04:54:23 And on top of a turret will be some remote controlled turret used to target aircraft
plane-crazy 2019-05-04 04:53:55 Then next to main cannon will be a machine gun the rapidly fires tnt balls.
plane-crazy 2019-05-04 04:53:28 That will basically one shot any noob turret that it hits
plane-crazy 2019-05-04 04:53:07 The rounds that my tank will shoot will be 5 block long tnt shells.
plane-crazy 2019-05-04 04:51:17 Because each of those things will interfere with gun depression and ideally you want have your gun be as depressed as a Hillary voter.
plane-crazy 2019-05-04 04:50:32 The magazine has to carry 30 rounds and yet be a short (so not tall or long)
plane-crazy 2019-05-04 04:49:34 The main problem is not so much the breach mechanism but more over the magazine
plane-crazy 2019-05-04 04:48:52 that fires tnt shells
plane-crazy 2019-05-04 04:48:30 I'm currently in the process of developing a breach loading cannon
plane-crazy 2019-05-04 04:44:11 xD
plane-crazy 2019-05-04 04:44:08 Oh lol I did not know that I was recording the sound
plane-crazy 2019-05-04 04:42:36 Is this considered slow?
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 15:58:19 Hmm
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 15:57:33 Is some of the total torque of all the motors combined lost when you stack them on top of each other?
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 12:45:47 I can’t seem to get my tank to move quickly despite the fact that it has a much higher power to weight ratio than smaller tanks.
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 12:38:19 So isthe speed of ground vehicles exclusively decided by the power to weight ratio or not?
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 12:21:17 Is the speed of ground vehicles exclusively decided by the power to weight ratio? Or are other things involved as well?
plane-crazy 2019-05-02 06:11:24 They cannot be relied upon to ddo anything
plane-crazy 2019-05-02 06:11:08 pistons are extremely glitchy
plane-crazy 2019-05-02 06:10:08 It says it gets up to speeds of 234
plane-crazy 2019-05-02 06:09:51 It's mainly the suspension that generates the lag
plane-crazy 2019-05-02 06:09:36 It works fine
plane-crazy 2019-05-02 06:09:26 Egh
plane-crazy 2019-05-02 06:09:11 For aesthetic purposes
plane-crazy 2019-05-02 06:08:24 Each wheel is 6 blocks in diameter
plane-crazy 2019-05-02 06:08:04 Interleaved roadwheels
plane-crazy 2019-05-02 06:07:16 
plane-crazy 2019-05-02 06:06:33 as of now somewhere around 2834
plane-crazy 2019-05-02 06:05:55 I want my tank to be light enough to move quickly (for its size that is) and heavy enough so that it doesn't move as if it were a balloon filled with air.
plane-crazy 2019-05-02 06:03:02 Yus
plane-crazy 2019-05-02 06:02:47 oof
plane-crazy 2019-05-02 06:02:21 Ok, so I could reduce the weight of my tank by using ballast blocks?
plane-crazy 2019-05-02 06:01:56 are all blocks equal in terms of armor restistance?
plane-crazy 2019-05-02 06:01:00 I wonder, in this game, is the falling speed of an object determined by it's total weight or it's total size/volume.
plane-crazy 2019-05-01 06:03:33 ok\
plane-crazy 2019-05-01 06:00:03 Can you send me a picture of one some time?
plane-crazy 2019-05-01 05:59:36 Mine was based of a four stroke otto cycle engine
plane-crazy 2019-05-01 05:58:53 Without having the ropes glitch out?
plane-crazy 2019-05-01 05:58:46 Really?
plane-crazy 2019-05-01 05:58:27 convert the power of rope contraction and expansion into torque.
plane-crazy 2019-05-01 05:55:54 If one does find a way to harness the power of ropes it will probably involve powered motors.
plane-crazy 2019-05-01 05:55:20 Despite numerous modifications, nothing would keep the ropes from glitching out
plane-crazy 2019-05-01 05:55:02 the three stroke engine did not work as I intended
plane-crazy 2019-05-01 05:54:36 Because my rope engine was a failure
plane-crazy 2019-05-01 05:54:09 I left
plane-crazy 2019-05-01 05:54:08 too late
plane-crazy 2019-05-01 05:52:20 And my rope engine is a failure.
plane-crazy 2019-05-01 05:51:30 this dude made a dino mech
plane-crazy 2019-05-01 03:57:17 If one could build an engine that harnessed the power of ropes they would probably be able to move giant ground-based vehicles at speeds far beyond what is currently physically possible using only motors.
plane-crazy 2019-05-01 03:55:20 That's just incredible
plane-crazy 2019-05-01 03:55:13 Just 6 ropes are able to drag  2571 blocks worth of weight at 1.5 blocks per second.
plane-crazy 2019-05-01 03:54:01 I conclude that ropes are immensely powerful
plane-crazy 2019-05-01 03:48:37 rope retraction has immense strength
plane-crazy 2019-05-01 03:48:21 dang
plane-crazy 2019-05-01 03:35:10 wow a lot of people are playing it
plane-crazy 2019-05-01 03:33:53 Oh, so I could probably use it to separate tnt blocks from one another
plane-crazy 2019-05-01 03:32:59 ah ok
plane-crazy 2019-05-01 03:31:52 what does break weld on a spring do?
plane-crazy 2019-05-01 03:30:28 Ok so I did some testing and I estimate that single spring at max strength is capable of moving about 321 blocks worth of weight about a quarter of a block.
plane-crazy 2019-05-01 03:18:03 Is that phone in particular used to talk to your creator?
plane-crazy 2019-05-01 03:15:12 does a ballast block at default settings weigh as much a normal 1 by 1 block?
plane-crazy 2019-05-01 03:14:14 Please I need technical help.
plane-crazy 2019-05-01 03:09:55 so does a ballast block set at 0.28 weigh as much as a normal block?
plane-crazy 2019-05-01 03:07:06 A belt fed system sounds very tempting as of now.
plane-crazy 2019-05-01 03:05:13 \
plane-crazy 2019-05-01 03:05:08 I don't think a 30 would be possible using on suspension
plane-crazy 2019-05-01 03:02:19 nah too advanced for it s time
plane-crazy 2019-05-01 03:01:06 Is that a cellphone case?
plane-crazy 2019-05-01 02:48:20 I don't have a dedicated graphics card
plane-crazy 2019-05-01 02:48:11 Rip computer then
plane-crazy 2019-05-01 02:45:51 My tank chassis already has 32 suspension springs
plane-crazy 2019-05-01 02:44:49 But suspension is laggy af
plane-crazy 2019-05-01 02:44:05 Ideally, I would like  my cannon to be as depressed as a 2016 Hillary Clinton voter.
plane-crazy 2019-05-01 02:42:42 yep
plane-crazy 2019-05-01 02:39:46 In order to allow for as much gun depression as possible without having to build an extremely tall turret.
plane-crazy 2019-05-01 02:39:23 vertically and short in the horizontal direction parallel to the cannon.
plane-crazy 2019-05-01 02:38:46 A high capacity magazine needs to be short vertical
plane-crazy 2019-05-01 02:37:19 This is my attempt on making one
plane-crazy 2019-05-01 02:27:31 Does anyone have picture of a high capacity cannon round magazine?
plane-crazy 2019-04-30 22:47:40 
plane-crazy 2019-04-30 22:45:09 a
plane-crazy 2019-04-30 22:42:51 what does break weld do on a spring?
plane-crazy 2019-04-30 22:41:11 I don't want to have to reinvent the wheel.
plane-crazy 2019-04-30 22:40:48 Does anyone have a  picture of the design?
plane-crazy 2019-04-30 22:40:27 wait so a reloadable breach-loading cannon has already been developed?
plane-crazy 2019-04-30 22:39:10 If it already is done then good for m
plane-crazy 2019-04-30 22:38:51 I care about whether it CAN be done
plane-crazy 2019-04-30 22:38:42 I don't care about inventing
plane-crazy 2019-04-30 22:35:04 As of now I'm developing a reloadable breach loading cannon.
plane-crazy 2019-04-30 22:33:38 ^
plane-crazy 2019-04-30 22:32:41 I wonder if its possible to turn the power of the spring into rotary movement
plane-crazy 2019-04-27 02:28:25 Cross country is a very popular sport near the border.
plane-crazy 2019-04-27 02:27:28 Send her back to South America
plane-crazy 2019-04-27 02:25:19 Yes, but I asked for a cannon, not a prop.
plane-crazy 2019-04-27 02:23:14 My wifi is so bad that this happens whenever I spawn in my tank.
plane-crazy 2019-04-27 02:14:31 R is for relationships and mine are nonexistent , 'cause my friends and my women? I like to keep the distant.
plane-crazy 2019-04-27 02:12:25 This is tank is fast af! :3
