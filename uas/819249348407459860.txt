creations-chat 2022-12-26 04:26:18 Greetings unfunny
creations-chat 2022-12-26 04:32:13 the emojis defeat the purpose of your statement
creations-chat 2022-12-26 04:36:01 that's my actual cat and I have no other pfp

also don't talk like a british person with your "oe amehricäns deunt häve freey elfkeh
creations-chat 2022-12-26 04:39:14 that's not the point I was trying to get across but alright. you know how when you look in a dictionary and you see the word and how it's pronounced? Anyways, how does it make it worse? Do you want me to change it to something random like a Mitsubishi f-2?
creations-chat 2022-12-26 04:42:18 your insults sound like you're a 50 year old mom

Also that's not 5 paragraphs, anyone who has ever been to basic English classes in elementary school would know that, you chicken fingerer.

Chicken fingerer is the most dumb and gross thing, 50 year old moms would die if they saw that
creations-chat 2022-12-26 04:44:21 that really goes along well
creations-chat 2022-12-26 04:46:26 I wouldn't say baited, I know when enough is enough

I'd rather say tempted into an "discussion"

But thank you for reminding me at least
creations-chat 2022-12-26 04:49:05 they aren't that good either

I'm not tempted to do anything else in this hellscape that is <#504436696021204992>

creations-chat 2022-12-26 04:51:23 i know, but at least I'm not bragging about it like a sore looser with an unfunny meme as their pfp

And yeah, you did win, so good job

creations-chat 2023-04-05 22:36:52 it's not meant to be, but it does, lol. I'm working on a soviet inspired apartment, but good observation!

it's a basic modular construction method I used lol
creations-chat 2023-04-05 22:41:00 Thanks, I really do appreciate it! It's based off of soviet designs, but not really meant to be any specific one. Thanks for the ideas though, I'll use them! 🙂

Do you want to design your own apartment room in it?

https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1027010880501727233/1093584000158814351/image.png

last time i saw it got 4 upvotes 2 downvotes and then got deleted. to be fair it was against the rules and i should have considered that but he did ask me to post it so i didnt really think anything would happen
creations-chat 2023-04-06 17:35:24 that looks like it's from shipping lanes, correct? I know that ships do exist outside of the game and i havent played it in a while but that ship looks like the default livery for one of them.

good job anyways, its really nice!
creations-chat 2023-05-06 17:05:20 thanks, i really do appreciate how much people like my builds, even though they're imperfect. thank you for your support :)
creations-chat 2023-05-06 17:35:01 Thanks for the feedback, I'll work on it when I get the time. Thanks anyways :)
creations-chat 2023-05-13 20:37:05 its not a wip, i dont have any intentions to finish it so im basically done
