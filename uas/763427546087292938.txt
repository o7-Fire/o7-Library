i need help building a mech. i have built the legs and a little of the upper body. it has no motorlock and when i put down one leg and let go the recoil makes the whole mech do an 90 degree spin (same for both feet). and i just discovered a new issue, it dont stand anymore is it because i changed the material from default to light? I would appreciate if someone would have helped me (i will send pic of the mech below). i speak english and would prefer vc or roblox vc
