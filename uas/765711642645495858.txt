creations-chat 2022-05-16 01:17:07 i dont know, but i think its got more to do with in order to become good at plane crazy you have to put weeks or more consecutively into the game. its a matter of having the time to get there
creations-chat 2022-05-16 01:21:46 agreed, the fan/player base is young kids. its insane to think of the effort it takes for a 10 - 12 year old kid. Its almost entitlement to standard; like if it doesn't fit "my" standard its not good enough. If someone is ok with a build and their happy with the build then why shame it? (unacknowledged but slightly toxic community)
creations-chat 2022-05-16 01:25:02 It really is quite sad now people are, To stoop so low as to bully, torment or shame children for not being keyboard warriors for plane crazy, truly sad. My builds are "good" by the standards we have no but im happy with them so that should be it right? No. This community in every server has one very toxic player. "garbage", "tut" etc.
creations-chat 2022-05-16 01:28:48 Atleast there are only a few, its usually a handful of the bunch who have dedicated every hour of free time to this game. Nothing wrong with that, just the toxicity.
