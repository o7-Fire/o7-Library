help 2021-07-06 01:33:52 https://youtu.be/mHc7yHZ60iY: can someone help me with my mig? I already adjust the angle for the on command motor lock, then I pressed the button to release the disconnectors, but the angle ends up being straight and not the one I made ( I used youtube because streamable wont work for some reason) ( sorry for the crappy video quality I was in a rush so i used roblox recorder)
