The Tale of endeyfire (305281953538768899)
the-dump 2019-01-27 17:48:00 *grabs gun* i got 7 bullets who wants to die as well?
help 2019-08-28 03:01:23 Whats the density of the water in game?
bug-reports 2019-10-15 09:29:27 <@217336009455566848> ive gotten flung from a mixture of block interation and parachutes. Tho i cant pinpoint whatever it may have been, as i was damn well going lightspeed.
bug-reports 2019-10-15 09:31:03 But thats about all i can tell u. It may include water as well. Tbh i like the bug, and i feel like its less of yalls faults as devs, and more so the game engine just gaining way to may inputs, and outputting u(as the player) at lightspeed as the result.
bug-reports 2019-10-15 09:31:22 It doesnt happen often, and when it does. Its funny.
bug-reports 2019-10-15 09:33:18 Unless it becomes a very common occurrence, id sudgest leaving it be, unless someone is able to fix it or finds something evidential to make it noteable.
bug-reports 2019-10-15 09:33:42 (I mean. Common, who doesnt like going lightspeed)

help 2020-03-11 13:21:49 the only conclusion i have to being banned is a A-hole who has my acc (a bud helped me comfirm this) and ive been trying to shake him for some time now. but idk what the dude does while im off so i cant say for certain.

bug-reports 2020-04-15 03:46:59 in mobile, when placing stuff in general, shit like this constantly occurs
bug-reports 2020-04-15 03:47:17 it is moderately annoying, and sometimes outright game breaking.
bug-reports 2020-04-15 03:49:51 in this instance, i have a 3by3 opening where im trying to put in the large rocket engine, however, the placement keeps being anywhere but inside the hole, and if it is in the hole, its invalid.

best way to describe this would be trying to put the two north ends of a magnet together.
bug-reports 2020-04-15 09:02:51 <@217336009455566848> i think its more along the lines of where the "place" point of the block is, per say the thruster being 3by3by4. that "place point" being im the back middle which gets abit irritating to place.

id sudgest having the blocks or placement system, for on mobile at least, allow abit of placement leeway. but thanks for letting me know :D
help 2020-04-22 00:41:10 uhhhh... ya know... its kind of hard to report players using <#623337136267067393> when i cant send screenshots
help 2020-04-22 00:42:05 maybe set up a bot? but uhh, im not *that* smart and most others probably arnt *as* smart to dig through their phones and tablets for the screenshot, then somehow convert it to a link.
help 2020-04-22 00:42:31 im just saying, something should be done about this >.>
