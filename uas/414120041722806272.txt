plane-crazy 2020-04-26 21:45:22 i made glitchy infinite spinner thing with hover thrusters
plane-crazy 2020-01-08 21:04:55 idk i just added wepaons on a stunt drone i made
plane-crazy 2020-01-08 21:04:05 using motors is easy
plane-crazy 2020-01-08 21:03:34 ive seen plenty of tanks and less experienced players like faster planes which means its them making it complicated for themselves
plane-crazy 2020-01-08 21:02:24 i can cover the motors and it wont affect its flight
plane-crazy 2020-01-08 21:01:47 propellors create cover for motors
plane-crazy 2020-01-08 21:00:43 servers will enjoy its unfinishing
plane-crazy 2020-01-08 20:59:55 as long as it stabilizes itself its fine
plane-crazy 2020-01-08 20:59:23 rocket lock on player so they cant hit propellors likely and it can fly with few blades missing just fine
plane-crazy 2020-01-08 20:56:04 its entirely propellor controlled
plane-crazy 2020-01-08 20:55:42 and adding proppelors can make it dfaster
plane-crazy 2020-01-08 20:55:25 tbh people dont know how to aim when i use it
plane-crazy 2020-01-08 20:54:02 it flies heavy but it has damage potential
