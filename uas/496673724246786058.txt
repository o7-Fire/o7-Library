creations-chat 2023-01-27 03:05:54 10 hover thrusters are better.
creations-chat 2023-01-27 03:17:38 For hover drive
creations-chat 2023-01-27 03:20:14 But when you add blocks you can't reach top speed, so I tested with 8 and noticed it was "faster" then I put 10 and now I can reach top speed.
creations-chat 2023-01-27 03:31:22 If your plane is big enough like mine (199 blocks, no motor lock) it can fit if you use that tail design that goes between the jet/rocket engines used for deco.
creations-chat 2023-01-27 03:34:23 2.5k speed?? How

creations-chat 2023-01-27 03:36:59 Ayy so it is you, but fr 2.5k speed is like.. idek its too fast. Also if the game uses knots as the unity of speed the 666 knots breaks the sound barrier
