creations-chat 2020-03-30 23:01:04 Some things to clarify:
1. The missile has an anchored block to create the picture
2. This was on my base. I know how to move to the sea and submerge it, but I'm too lazy to do it.
3. The missile isn't explosive because I don't know how to control it and make it hit a target
creations-chat 2020-03-30 23:02:04 4. It has parachutes so technically it is a rocket ship
