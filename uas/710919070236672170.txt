help 2022-08-19 21:23:20 how many blocks do you have underwater out of the whole height?
help 2022-08-19 21:35:00 i think it could be that you have too much mass on top, add helium to the upper most parts of the destroyer, and ballast to the bottom most part
help 2022-08-19 21:38:00 1. nice
2. well...
help 2022-08-19 21:38:59 you can add the helium inside the VERY TOP of the hull so long as you add ballast to the VERY BOTTOM block,
help 2022-08-19 21:39:10 it won't be as good as having the helium high up
help 2022-08-19 21:39:15 but it will remain stable
help 2022-08-19 21:39:37 if that doesn't work add a line of rocket engines on each side and use them to balance the ship manually

creations-chat 2022-08-23 01:47:49 According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way a bee should be able to fly. Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground. The bee, of course, flies anyway because bees don't care what humans think is impossible.
creations-chat 2022-08-23 01:52:55 1. its a joke

creations-chat 2022-08-26 04:48:44 don't know if i'm missing out on something but wdym by imported mesh?

it seems to be but i'm still wondering what do you mean by imported mesh
creations-chat 2022-08-27 14:06:15 you want another source?

here in south america, nobody uses this term, not irl, not in chats, and latino is already gender neutral, its not referring to a man from latin america, its referring to a person from latin america. Same issue with "Presidente" and "Presidenta", a bunch of people made it a political issue for some reason while in spanish "Presidente" doesn't care about gender, its about "Precede" which is along the lines of governing
