help 2022-09-17 21:52:48 can anyone help me making a hull for the front of my boat
help 2022-09-17 21:53:01 I've got the middle shape, but this front is driving me crazy
help 2022-09-18 02:14:33 can anyone help me with my ship hull?
help 2022-09-18 02:14:55 just the shape
help 2022-09-18 02:15:16 
help 2022-09-18 02:15:20 this is really screwing me up
help 2022-09-18 02:16:22 
help 2022-09-18 02:16:24 go figure lol
help 2022-09-18 02:16:29 this is my biggest issue atm
help 2022-09-18 02:17:00 I can see how that would pose an issue given the current shape
help 2022-09-18 02:17:42 I'm not really going for accuracy, it's basically my own design
help 2022-09-18 02:17:48 still, I think that'd be easier anyways
help 2022-09-18 02:18:00 piracy era essentially

help 2022-09-18 02:19:37 I'm unfortunately restricted to the plot, which is why it looks funny
help 2022-09-18 02:20:24 I'm planning on making the bowsprit vertical then letting it fall basically
help 2022-09-18 02:20:45 I've already folded it
help 2022-09-18 02:20:58 
help 2022-09-18 02:22:31 
help 2022-09-18 02:22:43 I kinda wanna do that first part, then figure out the second part after
help 2022-09-18 02:23:04 I'm more focused on the shape of the hull (because that's what I'm bad at)
help 2022-09-18 02:26:56 I think it's too pointed
