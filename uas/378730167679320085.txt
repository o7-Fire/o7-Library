creations-chat 2022-10-02 19:45:47 My dude that thing is 100% going to be shredder bait
creations-chat 2022-10-26 15:31:34 How do you confuse a Falken for a Darkstar
creations-chat 2022-10-27 19:29:25 What even is going on
I literally had a stroke reading that last message from Flaco.

Ah yes, let me post a build of mine and receive negative criticism like the other builders who made builds similar to mine of the same quality.
creations-chat 2022-10-27 19:36:59 Fighting? More like mocking.

They're judging whatever the hell that is in creations you posted.

It did.
creations-chat 2023-01-01 00:37:34 And the flaps, look at the wings a bit closer and you'll see
creations-chat 2023-02-19 22:52:47 I am well aware, but I am refusing to fix it. (Was debating on getting rid of it, regardless)
creations-chat 2023-02-19 23:08:01 Thanks, but it's still just another F-14, which I probably should have refused to even share, hell you should've seen the other 7 attempts and older versions I've done to try and recreate it.
creations-chat 2023-02-27 08:00:42 What even is going on
WHAT IN GODS NAME
As if being in the PCC isn't harming one mentally already
creations-chat 2023-04-01 00:06:33 It's literally just red?
creations-chat 2023-04-08 02:09:56 Anyone know why things are taking nearly a minute and a half to load in?
(Ex. Messages, Locking, etc.)

Har har, funny... Seriously, cause it took several minutes to load a motor locked build, and a minute and 28 seconds to send a message.
creations-chat 2023-06-08 02:00:02 I think it exceeds that...
creations-chat 2023-06-08 02:36:10 I personally don't have the focus to try and get out of being a white name, so I guess I am by choice, not sure.
creations-chat 2023-06-29 02:48:04 Squircle wheels
creations-chat 2023-06-29 02:51:13 Bro, the wheels really went to wikipedia
creations-chat 2023-06-29 03:14:13 Those wheels are still not circular ðŸ’€
creations-chat 2023-06-30 15:38:53 Could look better at the front

Also, should I make an A-10 or MiG-25?
creations-chat 2023-07-05 00:01:45 I'm pretty sure they want to see the account for another reason lol
Why would someone want to dox you anyways when they barely know you.
