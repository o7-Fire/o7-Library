plane-crazy 2020-07-29 00:41:01 Does anyone, have a realistic helicopter.
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 23:14:49 And I'm not talking about a Tipjet or coaxial rotors.
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 23:14:32 Anyone know how to make a realistic helicopter?
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 02:29:35 It should be okay to bypass it in some god awful cases, since dear god, those people who like underage anime pron, just please arrest them for kiddy pron.
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 02:28:07 I shall display my hatred for weebs that take a liking to underage anime pron.
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 02:27:17 Although, the weebs, they can just fall.
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 02:26:39 Why all the furries? Most of them aren't degenerates that need to be killed for heresy.
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 23:56:52 > imagine player scale fighter jet
*screeches internally in need of realism.*
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 18:07:36 increases weight in a place
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 22:32:36 Heck, I've only landed once at base in warthunder.
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 22:32:01 I know how to land a plane on a carrier, and i haven't landed a plane on a carrier in war thunder.
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 03:21:40 Make some obscure plane from WW2.
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 03:21:18 > yeah my 11 year old cousin tried this game and made a "golf cart" which was a box with wheels on it, i said no but then he threatened to blackmail me
lol
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 03:20:58 But no psfnerdojcvdhncjkow, i don't want to ride your plane which resembles an eldritch mass.
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 03:20:36 Like, I'm fine with the former of the two
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 03:20:23 Yea
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 03:20:06 If people insult you, try to insult them back.
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 03:19:40 And maybe even insult his name
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 03:19:35 I'd just except that joke
plane-crazy 2020-07-15 22:51:41 The general shape of the plane is like the tutorial plane.
plane-crazy 2020-07-15 22:50:55 I said that it *looks* like the tutorial plane.
plane-crazy 2020-07-15 22:50:40 > Infact, it just looks like an *thicc*er tutorial plane.
plane-crazy 2020-07-15 22:50:06 That's the exact reason why people dislike it.
plane-crazy 2020-07-15 22:49:47 ***The*** tutorial plane.
plane-crazy 2020-07-15 22:49:36 Also, I'm talking the tutorial that the game gives you when you're new.
plane-crazy 2020-07-15 22:49:26 Infact, it just looks like an *thicc*er tutorial plane.
plane-crazy 2020-07-15 22:48:57 > Bobby why a downvote
It looks like the tutorial plane, my guy.
plane-crazy 2020-07-15 22:48:44 Also, Ebooklet
plane-crazy 2020-07-15 22:48:20 
plane-crazy 2020-07-15 22:47:34 By bomber, I'm talking this.

plane-crazy 2020-07-15 22:47:11 > but i mean it would actually catch regular bombers that ran into the net too
Idk who would ram their large, humongous, bomber, into a ground target.
plane-crazy 2020-07-15 22:46:03 That drop bombs.
plane-crazy 2020-07-15 22:45:53 Not actual legitimate bombers.
plane-crazy 2020-07-15 22:45:38 Ooooh, you're talking those absolutely horrible kamikaze planes.
plane-crazy 2020-07-15 22:44:16 I hate those things.
plane-crazy 2020-07-15 22:43:30 > bomber nets are kinda pog

plane-crazy 2020-07-15 22:24:08 Therefore
plane-crazy 2020-07-15 22:23:52 I do see that a good portion of it is locked motor, but when loaded, the locked motors assume a position where it looks like a ðŸš™.
plane-crazy 2020-07-15 22:23:15 Is the entire thing made of locked motors?
plane-crazy 2020-07-15 22:22:14 Cool, It's ***c a r***.
plane-crazy 2020-07-07 16:09:32 fuck it
plane-crazy 2020-07-07 16:08:36 I would leave, because this place is full of god damn idiots. But I probably can't since I'm in the PCAA as well.
plane-crazy 2020-07-07 16:07:32 I know a damn dystopia.
plane-crazy 2020-07-07 16:07:18 Holy jesus fucking christ
plane-crazy 2020-07-07 16:05:09 No, a dystopian society is one which has its people have no rights to their core. But a Post apocalyptic world is anarchic.
plane-crazy 2020-07-07 16:02:47 Since so far, I've only seen vehicles which are post apocalyptic.
plane-crazy 2020-07-07 16:02:34 Guess I'm not going into the contest, with the only actually Dystopian Vehicle.
plane-crazy 2020-07-07 15:54:38 > no reskins or stupid add-on's to pre-existing creations
Would a Jet that was being made still be able to be modified to work in the contest?
plane-crazy 2020-07-07 15:46:13 At all
plane-crazy 2020-07-07 15:46:12 It doesn't
plane-crazy 2020-07-07 15:43:15 You also have alot of fuel.
plane-crazy 2020-07-07 15:43:08 You are indeed going quite fast
plane-crazy 2020-07-07 15:42:39 That's why i say "would" in "Ministry of Peace *would* roll out".
plane-crazy 2020-07-07 15:41:56 Well, the book never directly talks about the things Oceania uses in the War.
plane-crazy 2020-07-07 15:40:25 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nations_of_Nineteen_Eighty-Four
plane-crazy 2020-07-07 15:39:16 It wasn't meant for the contest before, but now I'm planning on making it look like something that the Ministry of Peace would roll out for the endless war Oceania is in.
plane-crazy 2020-07-07 15:37:53 Whatcha guys think.
plane-crazy 2020-07-07 14:57:54 It probably is old then.
plane-crazy 2020-07-07 14:57:49 I'm able to walk into block cubes
plane-crazy 2020-07-07 14:57:44 Huh
plane-crazy 2020-07-07 14:57:23 The server's been up for 9 days.

plane-crazy 2020-07-07 14:56:25 
plane-crazy 2020-07-07 14:56:21 Ey, so this guy named saadeh is probably using hacks to get into my block cube.
plane-crazy 2020-07-06 02:53:07 I like it, invokes nightmares, just a generally cute train.
plane-crazy 2020-07-04 13:59:33 > reverse psychology , ask for upvotes get downvotes , thats why some kids say DOWNVOTE PLEASE
I don't think kids know reverse psychology. This probably shows that the kids know how to assume things, "Oh, they ask for upvotes, but get downvoted. So ask for downvotes, and get upvotes!"
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 13:29:58 What about a cylinder which explodes, unwelds the object above it, *and launches the object that's above it* to wherever it's been aimed.
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 04:55:00 It's called something like a see saw.
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 04:41:02 Now i gotta do this.

plane-crazy 2020-06-28 23:54:00 Wanna go to VIP 1?
plane-crazy 2020-06-28 23:39:38 Thanks for giving me enough motivation to continue on that horrid thing.
plane-crazy 2020-06-28 23:38:59 Which is something that's probably *incredibly god damn impossible.*
plane-crazy 2020-06-28 23:38:50 I want it to *self stabilize as well.*
plane-crazy 2020-06-28 23:38:43 those propellers exist to just knock it over.
plane-crazy 2020-06-28 23:37:03 I feel like looking at an elder god so that im insane enough to continue working on that abomination.
plane-crazy 2020-06-28 23:36:04 It's an opinion that's not really relevant.
plane-crazy 2020-06-28 23:34:05 Anyone got an opinion?
plane-crazy 2020-06-28 23:25:52 This is the Semi Rigid Rotor of a B206
plane-crazy 2020-06-28 23:25:10 A Semi Rigid Rotor is a type of helicopter Rotor.

plane-crazy 2020-06-28 23:08:37 dang boi
plane-crazy 2020-06-28 23:08:27 Although, if im correct on what a swashplate does, then i want this thing to effectively be a swashplate.
plane-crazy 2020-06-28 23:03:42 And i want this to be stuck on a huey and work.
plane-crazy 2020-06-28 23:03:33 Idk what the heck is a swashplate.
plane-crazy 2020-06-28 23:03:25 Well, idk.
plane-crazy 2020-06-28 23:02:41 No, and im still working on it.
plane-crazy 2020-06-28 23:01:31 Anyone like this disgusting thing?
plane-crazy 2020-06-28 22:32:40 And im trying to make a semi rigid rotor
plane-crazy 2020-06-28 22:09:46 Noone knows how to make a semi rigid rotor, k.

plane-crazy 2020-06-27 21:10:02 Every time i try to load up a plane with like, a few thousand blocks, and unfold it once, it lags the hecc out of the game.
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 12:32:29 And that was a lie.
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 12:32:22 Vungie, that hull is so beautiful, that i shall give you an emoji.

plane-crazy 2020-06-27 05:14:54 Yes
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 05:14:32 You don't really need to sacrifice too much maneuvering ability to make a compact turret.

plane-crazy 2020-06-27 05:10:18 Yep

plane-crazy 2020-06-27 05:05:16 No, motors are okay.
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 05:05:01 Turret could probably easily be dealt with, but with how tiny the sucker is, wheels is kinda an issue.
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 05:04:43 Eh, Its turret and its wheels.

plane-crazy 2020-06-27 03:22:53 since i had thought of making a Viking, but then i realized that i cannot make a transformable mech that's tiny enough to be realistic.
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 03:22:21 Yea
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 03:20:52 Eh, i tried making it as realistic to size as possible.

plane-crazy 2020-06-18 22:06:56 being honest, i hope that cannons can be used like flak.
plane-crazy 2020-06-18 22:04:06 *Or you're going in the naughty corner.*
plane-crazy 2020-06-18 22:03:56 *Don't swear.*
plane-crazy 2020-06-18 22:01:53 It's building system isn't as funky as Plane Crazy because it has 2x2 wedges and stuff.
plane-crazy 2020-06-18 22:01:26 Take a long fat look at From The Depths.
plane-crazy 2020-06-18 22:00:23 2x2 wedge blocks.
plane-crazy 2020-06-18 22:00:10 I'm talking 2x2 wedges
plane-crazy 2020-06-18 21:59:30 it'd make building for noobs easier.
plane-crazy 2020-06-18 21:59:16 I want *wider* wedges as well.
plane-crazy 2020-06-18 21:59:09 Being honest to god
plane-crazy 2020-06-18 21:58:59 wedges first, aight.
plane-crazy 2020-06-18 21:58:38 Yea, that sounds nice.
