creations-chat 2020-09-19 04:32:59 
creations-chat 2020-09-19 04:33:16 I've recently gotten into using motors for those types of wings, and also motorlocking.
creations-chat 2020-09-19 04:33:55 I've actually been using motorlocking for a load of aircraft, including making planes that have an even width (4.)
creations-chat 2020-09-19 04:34:22 I'd suggest getting a motor lock with the turret motor, bori.

creations-chat 2020-09-19 04:39:25 Cylinders allow for custom suspension, which allows you to do dope terrain stuff. The only really bad cons are that suspensions can do a KSP Kraken moment, and wheels make it look less like a tank.

creations-chat 2020-10-07 13:36:06 Yea, i know.
creations-chat 2020-10-07 13:36:33 Technically, when i launch you out of a cannon for the heresy you spouted earlier, you'd be an aircraft as well.
creations-chat 2020-10-07 13:37:16 Maybe I'll launch your mom too, but she might be too fat for a cannon.
creations-chat 2020-10-07 13:41:44 Not even Lil David, with a 914mm diameter for *launching aerial bombs*, could launch her into the sky.

creations-chat 2020-10-07 14:30:30 To be exact.
The tail is incredibly small compared to the wings. And the only thing wrong with the wings are the incredibly long ailerons (they don't go *that* far into the wings.)
creations-chat 2020-10-07 14:31:22

creations-chat 2020-10-07 14:33:00 And from quick observations.
Your ailerons are too far into the wing, and not at the tips.
Your vertical rear rudders are not as long as it should be.
creations-chat 2020-10-07 14:33:16 The body is actually not too bad I'd say, other than the absolutely large gun blisters.

help 2020-10-12 20:27:23 > It could be a friction problem, which in that case paint the part touching the sides to ice material
You could also change where your turret is in contact with its main body into 1x0.9 blocks.
help 2020-10-12 20:31:13 You can also do the reverse, and make the part where the main body is in contact with the turret into 1x0.9 blocks.
help 2020-12-22 23:36:37 Note that with Glitch Drives, there isn't a speed limit.
help 2020-12-22 23:36:51 So just be careful.

bug-reports 2020-12-28 01:14:31 I'm now gonna pop in and say that I also have the same issue as DeadNoob789.
bug-reports 2021-01-04 21:44:49 I definitely don't get usage of Motor 2's for arms.
bug-reports 2021-01-04 21:45:28 Angling, that's one of the only reasons I use Motor 2's.
But using it to turn an arm? *No*.
bug-reports 2021-01-04 21:46:02 Get a Motor 1, crank the torque up, and get a keypad.
help 2021-01-04 23:04:51 You'll run into the same issue that happened in testing.
help 2021-01-04 23:05:04 You have to keep moving or the thing will fall out of the sky.
help 2021-01-08 04:21:44 Every time I see those cursed words, I need to pour a few liters of bleach on my eyes again.

help 2021-03-26 07:12:21 Could someone give me a decent bomb design?
help 2021-03-26 07:13:24 Not one of those disgustingly overpowered ~~motorlock abomination~~ cluster bombs.
help 2021-03-26 07:16:31 I have reasonable limits now, because I do understand how useful they are.
help 2021-03-26 07:16:47 The issue is that I'm not gonna use several hundred motors just for an overpowered abomination.
help 2021-03-26 07:17:27 I'm already sacrificing some beauty just so I can safely shove a bunch of fins and crap on.
help 2021-03-26 07:20:38 Right now, my bomb design is inaccurate, It goes way off a target.
help 2021-03-26 07:21:25 Either way, a bomb without fins won't be hitting the target unless you're dive bombing yourself with the bomb into a target.
help 2021-03-26 07:21:33 So is there like, a really good fin design?
help 2021-03-26 07:22:02 nam, I've hit my targets before.
help 2021-03-26 07:22:42 But because PC physics isn't IRL physics, the bomb right now doesn't drag and slow down so It's effectively going to fall in a disgustingly bumpy arc.
help 2021-03-26 07:23:01 And It's either fins, or disgusting parachute bombs.
help 2021-03-26 07:23:32 Wot?
help 2021-03-26 07:23:51 The only things I've called disgusting is horrifying motorlock abuse, and parachute bombs.
help 2021-03-26 07:25:32 You understand why every dumb bomb has fins?
help 2021-03-26 07:26:19 It's called stabilization.
help 2021-03-26 07:26:39 Yea, and why are you getting angry about it then?
help 2021-03-26 07:27:39 I'll just ask another discord, cuz I'm only gettin insulted over here.
help 2021-03-26 07:28:25 Yea, about superstraight.
help 2021-03-26 07:28:57 Yea, I did, and I hopped back for actually no reason.

creations-chat 2022-06-30 23:37:44 mmmm, time for me to make a shitty chassis because i don't know how to make a tank
(especially mini tank)
creations-chat 2022-07-02 14:50:24 Uncolored F-111 Aardvark, It's not really good imo. Should I switch over to Motor 1's or keep the Motor 2's for the sweep wings?
