creations-chat 2019-07-25 00:02:25 I like how my missile reloading system on my ATGM launcher is almost the same, BionclSage. Can you try doing a really compact missile one? I like to see what you can make in a 2 high workspace.

the-dump 2021-12-16 13:43:13 Not what I was expecting it to be, but it looks cool
the-dump 2021-12-16 13:43:22 Might be because I am biased
the-dump 2021-12-16 13:43:34 I like it
the-dump 2021-12-16 13:43:46 Isn't it a hybrid?
the-dump 2021-12-16 13:44:04 AWD
the-dump 2021-12-16 13:44:10 god damn
the-dump 2021-12-16 13:44:13 Oh well
the-dump 2021-12-16 13:44:23 I mean, eventually every car will have an EV variant
the-dump 2021-12-16 13:44:56 It kinda rocks ngl
the-dump 2021-12-16 13:45:06 I really like this new Lexus concept render
the-dump 2021-12-16 13:45:58 Yeah I heard. They have a sedan variant as well no?
the-dump 2021-12-16 13:46:18 Shows they've been working hard though
the-dump 2021-12-16 13:47:07 The SUV (and crossover?) don't work for me
the-dump 2021-12-16 13:47:16 But the sedan and coupe really do
the-dump 2021-12-16 13:49:43 Toyota will probably get a lot of hate for releasing an EV lineup but I don't care at all lol
the-dump 2021-12-16 13:49:51 If the cars look like that I want to buy one
the-dump 2021-12-16 13:50:18 Now let's see if they market it as well as their GR Supra commercial
the-dump 2021-12-16 13:52:28 Wow yes uh unfunny rating try again

the-dump 2021-12-16 13:55:28 I thought this was a Mazda because of the bodywork
the-dump 2021-12-16 13:55:33 CX-3 I believe?
the-dump 2021-12-16 13:58:06 I want to get that new MR-2 as fast as possible LO
the-dump 2021-12-16 13:59:41 I just got an MR-S but I want one as soon as possible
the-dump 2021-12-16 14:00:09 the AW11 and SW20 will most likely be old timers by then but eventually I want to own all 4
the-dump 2021-12-16 14:00:58 But what do you think of the new lineup though
the-dump 2021-12-16 14:01:04 Since your opinion is also welcome to me

events-chat 2022-01-14 12:19:30 Question; how fast do ya'll ships go?
events-chat 2022-01-14 12:20:54 It will most likely be streamed on the PCC twitch account
events-chat 2022-01-14 12:21:09 But we do not allow spectators in the game server
events-chat 2022-01-14 12:21:24 Because all server spots are reserved for the participants
events-chat 2022-01-14 12:21:36 Basic knowledge though
events-chat 2022-01-14 12:22:03 We will pick another backup participant in that instance
events-chat 2022-01-14 12:22:18 That's up to the event host
events-chat 2022-01-14 12:22:51 Submit it right now and you might make it in
events-chat 2022-01-14 12:22:59 Submissions close today
events-chat 2022-01-14 12:23:08 And I don't know when RBK decides to close them
events-chat 2022-01-14 12:24:12 Rooster ass
events-chat 2022-01-14 12:24:53 I mean you don't have to
events-chat 2022-01-14 12:25:06 But if you want to be in the event then yes
events-chat 2022-01-14 12:25:53 Why
events-chat 2022-01-14 12:26:25 DM me the link to the creation and the video it's from
events-chat 2022-01-14 12:31:13 Just post 2
events-chat 2022-01-14 12:31:32 Then DM me the images

events-chat 2022-01-14 12:34:19 If I am not there when you join, just ping me
events-chat 2022-01-14 12:43:13 Max speed of mine is about 110
events-chat 2022-01-14 12:43:55 too much speed is bad because the fighting area is kinda small
events-chat 2022-01-14 12:50:50 Sea mines are quite effective ngl
events-chat 2022-01-14 12:58:09 Why did I not see that
events-chat 2022-01-14 12:58:10 wow

events-chat 2022-01-14 18:56:43 02:30 for me B)
events-chat 2022-01-14 19:27:42 The sad part is, that will probably never be used because the arena is pretty small
events-chat 2022-01-14 19:32:04 Anything from 13 to 20 am will work for me best
events-chat 2022-01-14 19:41:52 Fighting at 200 is already hard

events-chat 2022-01-14 19:44:26 Anything from 13 to 20 am I can do just fine
events-chat 2022-01-14 19:46:00 Maybe like choose the contestants first and then decide on a time
events-chat 2022-01-14 19:46:09 Because you have plenty of submissions to go through first
events-chat 2022-01-14 19:46:13 <:stuff:908917207986208828>
events-chat 2022-01-14 20:06:33 That makes the situation a bit worse

the-dump 2022-01-15 23:21:52 I have already showered and I am not going back outside now lo

the-dump 2022-01-15 23:25:12 There
the-dump 2022-01-15 23:25:15 I bought it like this
the-dump 2022-01-15 23:25:40 I am really not a BMW guy
the-dump 2022-01-15 23:26:01 I like the look of the newest Z4 and the Z3 but I have never actively heard one rev before
the-dump 2022-01-15 23:26:12 Since most of the people that drive them are like 60 years old
the-dump 2022-01-15 23:27:20 I rev mine at like 6k max
the-dump 2022-01-15 23:27:55 Petrol
the-dump 2022-01-15 23:28:26 I have massive oil problems with the 1zz I run currently
the-dump 2022-01-15 23:28:42 It's a 2001 model and it is **very** thirsty
the-dump 2022-01-15 23:29:16 It's with every 1zz engine from 1998 to 2002
the-dump 2022-01-15 23:29:40 They fixed the problems in 2003 but the prices for those cars are like 1k extra
the-dump 2022-01-15 23:30:01 True, but it's still 1k
the-dump 2022-01-15 23:30:15 And i'd rather spend a bit more on oil than that
the-dump 2022-01-15 23:30:35 Depends on what though lol
the-dump 2022-01-15 23:31:01 5 gears
the-dump 2022-01-15 23:31:07 Stick only
the-dump 2022-01-15 23:31:35 Lol no
the-dump 2022-01-15 23:31:54 Better torque distrobution I guess
the-dump 2022-01-15 23:31:59 But this car really don't need it
the-dump 2022-01-15 23:32:14 It only tops at about 210 km/h
the-dump 2022-01-15 23:32:28 And it's known for how stable it is (not counting the snap oversteer)
the-dump 2022-01-15 23:32:57 But a BMW is even thirstier and way more expensive to maintain unfortunately
the-dump 2022-01-15 23:33:47 How much did you pay for it (if you want to share that info)
the-dump 2022-01-15 23:34:05 Damn quite expensive
the-dump 2022-01-15 23:34:33 Jeebus
the-dump 2022-01-15 23:34:43 I run like 7.2L/100km
the-dump 2022-01-15 23:34:44 lol
the-dump 2022-01-15 23:35:07 If only I could afford that at the moment
the-dump 2022-01-15 23:35:22 On regular trips I pay like 4 euro's
the-dump 2022-01-15 23:35:24 I do yes
the-dump 2022-01-15 23:35:58 As for normal commuter cars i'd say Lexus is a favourite of mine
the-dump 2022-01-15 23:36:09 If you count exotic, definitely Mclaren

events-chat 2022-01-31 06:58:18 I am quite busy this week so we'll see
events-chat 2022-01-31 07:35:20 Opened my e-mail just now goddamn
events-chat 2022-01-31 12:15:08 Technically, if Rick hadn't declared motorlocking a game feature, it wouldn't be allowed and everyone would have gone ape mode <:trollface:775024642104229898>
events-chat 2022-01-31 12:19:56 It don't say they are, but aren't hover engines way to powerful for the event anyway
events-chat 2022-01-31 12:20:02 Like
events-chat 2022-01-31 12:20:11 300 is the max speed in level flight
events-chat 2022-01-31 12:21:03 idk ask rbk I guess
events-chat 2022-01-31 12:21:08 Too technical for me
events-chat 2022-01-31 12:21:09 lo
events-chat 2022-01-31 12:21:21 PCC physics scare me
events-chat 2022-01-31 12:23:40 People be building twin boom aircraft aye?
events-chat 2022-01-31 12:23:50 Nothing will beat my D.XXIII
events-chat 2022-01-31 12:26:42 Motorlock armour (extremely cringe)
events-chat 2022-01-31 12:27:00 What if I accidentally shot the one motor keeping your wings in place
events-chat 2022-01-31 12:27:26 Are all of those needed for 300 speed

events-chat 2022-01-31 12:29:31 I am trying to make a motorlockless plane
events-chat 2022-01-31 12:29:37 Which is like
events-chat 2022-01-31 12:29:38 smart
events-chat 2022-01-31 12:30:24 Because if one motor of the lock gets destroyed, it will be a flying wreck
events-chat 2022-01-31 12:30:26 basically
events-chat 2022-01-31 12:30:38 Yes
events-chat 2022-01-31 12:30:47 You'll die if you hit the right motor
events-chat 2022-01-31 12:31:13 One good hit and it's a goner
events-chat 2022-01-31 12:31:14 lol
events-chat 2022-01-31 12:31:37 And since 4 gun shots destroy a block instantly it's a pretty easy task
events-chat 2022-01-31 12:31:38 lol
events-chat 2022-01-31 12:34:38 I could go to some old colleagues of mine to look at a real Fokker D.21 but that is just a waste of effort ngl
events-chat 2022-01-31 12:34:50 And this is such a hard shape to make without using motorlock
events-chat 2022-01-31 12:35:31 Dutch design 💪
events-chat 2022-01-31 12:35:40 Stolen and used by Finland
events-chat 2022-01-31 12:35:51 Very good aircraft

events-chat 2022-01-31 12:59:39 (we can stack 8 guns ontop of each other)
events-chat 2022-01-31 12:59:55 It will tear through your wing, armour and speed like nothing
events-chat 2022-01-31 13:00:19 Focused fire for massive damage when hit
events-chat 2022-01-31 13:00:26 Basically a 30mm cannon
events-chat 2022-01-31 13:01:24 Oh you one of those fuckers that use engine blocks for ultra unrealistic manoeuvrability aren't you
events-chat 2022-01-31 13:01:42 Yeah actually i'm probably going to sit out this event if there's going to be tryhards lol
events-chat 2022-01-31 13:01:52 I'm here to have fun
events-chat 2022-01-31 13:01:54 Not to like

creations-chat 2022-01-31 19:22:29 Feels a bit wrong to warn him with that much effort
creations-chat 2022-01-31 19:23:10 <@!709400929178222711> Mind if you'd post that build of yours when the interior is fully complete? WIP builds aren't allowed but since it's pretty much done already I won't warn you for it.
creations-chat 2022-01-31 19:27:06 Yeah but that's like wrong if I warn him for that
creations-chat 2022-01-31 19:27:07 lo
creations-chat 2022-01-31 19:34:05 Aight cool, you can post it again sorry for that
creations-chat 2022-01-31 19:34:33 :)
events-chat 2022-01-31 21:31:01 Yeah but shooting down bombers can be fun
events-chat 2022-01-31 21:31:18 Since those aren't going to be manoeuvring very quick
creations-chat 2022-02-02 14:46:50 I mean I can't ban it
creations-chat 2022-02-02 14:46:58 But I can verbally tell them to not post those

events-chat 2022-02-03 14:40:29 (Not a jet one since those suck cry)
events-chat 2022-02-03 14:46:59 All cring give original bomber (not from war thunder)
events-chat 2022-02-03 14:47:29 Too complicated <:trollface:775024642104229898>
events-chat 2022-02-03 14:48:48 Yes but swept wing. Remember that I suck at building
events-chat 2022-02-03 14:50:45 The most complicated i'm willing to try is a B-24
events-chat 2022-02-03 14:51:15 Since limited time, no jets and I suck at building
events-chat 2022-02-03 14:51:43 <:trollface:775024642104229898> 👍
events-chat 2022-02-03 14:51:52 Issa jet
events-chat 2022-02-03 14:52:35 Correct, but it looks stupud
events-chat 2022-02-03 14:52:50 Fokker T.V
events-chat 2022-02-03 14:53:58 Oh wait, Fokker T.6
events-chat 2022-02-03 14:54:03 👍
events-chat 2022-02-03 14:54:35 But too complicated since I don't motorlock/anglelock
events-chat 2022-02-03 14:54:37 Cope
events-chat 2022-02-03 14:55:19 Correct, I haven't played plane crazy a lot
events-chat 2022-02-03 14:55:23 <:trollface:775024642104229898>
events-chat 2022-02-03 14:55:41 Fokker T.6 it is
events-chat 2022-02-03 14:55:43 Ok
events-chat 2022-02-03 14:58:28 No
events-chat 2022-02-03 14:58:41 Missing piston engines
events-chat 2022-02-04 11:03:21 If you can't participate, delete your submission. That's all you need to do :)
events-chat 2022-02-04 11:33:43 300 is the maximum. The only way you can go over that limit is when diving
events-chat 2022-02-04 11:34:04 If you cannot evade shots because you don't have enough speed, you don't have a good aircraft
events-chat 2022-02-04 11:34:08 <:stuff:908917207986208828>
events-chat 2022-02-04 11:35:10 So long it doesn't contribute to the maximum level flight speed it's fine
events-chat 2022-02-04 11:35:20 (but cringe nontheless)
events-chat 2022-02-04 11:37:39 I mean, yeah but the objective of winning this event for your team is by shooting down the bombers
events-chat 2022-02-04 11:43:19 Killing rbk brb
events-chat 2022-02-04 11:43:39 ok Max speed is 350
events-chat 2022-02-04 12:28:07 Yeah rbk changed the rules and I didn't notice

events-chat 2022-02-07 09:29:43 People are so unhappy about an event because they can't make their own designs?
events-chat 2022-02-07 09:33:35 Is it because most of you are addicted to motorlocking or?
events-chat 2022-02-07 09:34:01 Because pretty much every design will look the same lol
events-chat 2022-02-07 12:24:58 How are you struggling with 100 max block count lol
events-chat 2022-02-07 12:25:27 The objective of the event is tiny plane warfare

events-chat 2022-02-07 12:27:20 Mate, how about you read the entire thing before starting to waste time
events-chat 2022-02-07 12:27:29 I am busy with the tutorials
events-chat 2022-02-07 12:27:50 Tincan is already that basically

events-chat 2022-02-07 12:32:12 I am not the event organiser. But to make it balanced, make the speed of the heavy bomber about 150-170 with no guns and 2 maxed out explosive blocks
events-chat 2022-02-07 12:32:23 I am working on those
events-chat 2022-02-07 12:34:13 The YM-3 is already pretty unmanoeuvrable. I suggest adding 1 control surface for each wing; wings and tails

events-chat 2022-02-10 09:58:33 It's a dogfight event, not a 1944 naval battle recreation
events-chat 2022-02-10 10:01:30 Yes, but you are:
- Abandoning your team and stuff
- Not playing the event properly
- Making it very unfun for others that are actively enjoying the event
events-chat 2022-02-10 10:01:35 So no
events-chat 2022-02-10 10:01:40 It defeats the purpose of the event
events-chat 2022-02-10 10:02:49 Your armament should be fixed and facing forward, unless specified otherwise in the announcement

events-chat 2022-02-10 11:05:43 So naturally, any modifications to the aircraft are made for either better gun placement or detailing

events-chat 2022-02-14 14:14:43 Ok
events-chat 2022-02-14 15:03:17 During excessive testing, it has shown that the bombers can easily return to base. Even when they are heavily damaged.
events-chat 2022-02-14 15:05:33 As well as that, bombers are made to bomb and return to base. 1 gun can tear any defending plane to shreds if you aim well enough. We don't want to turn bombers into gunships.

events-chat 2022-02-16 09:00:29 Fun fact: the max speed for the yousuf is 120 - 130
events-chat 2022-02-16 09:01:14 
events-chat 2022-02-16 09:01:18 Momen
events-chat 2022-02-16 10:55:34 The bombers' speed is capped between 120 - 130 horizontal speed to **balance** it. There is no definitive speed number because we allowed people to make modifications to their aircraft (some wings added/removed, different configuration etc). The precise reason we replaced the engines on the yousuf is so that it would not be fast. If you would use that almond brain of yours for once and take the advice I have given you (twice) and just play the event how it's supposed to, you wouldn't have wasted your time.
events-chat 2022-02-16 10:56:34 If you want to make a custom plane for an event, do so; but not in this one.
events-chat 2022-02-16 11:01:05 I like what you are trying to do with the build itself, the problem lies in the performance of it.

A. Did you ask for feedback on your builds?

B. Why are you angry
creations-chat 2022-03-09 00:07:27 <@!892571073881726988> 
Asking for advice comes with criticism. To me it seems that you didn't take that criticism too well.
creations-chat 2022-03-09 00:07:37 Unless of course you can prove it to me otherwise
creations-chat 2022-03-09 00:10:48 Aight aight gentlemen let's settle this a little more maturely thanks
creations-chat 2022-03-09 00:11:31 For all of you, stop with the toxicity. It isn't asked for in the slightest.
creations-chat 2022-03-09 00:13:33 Best advice I can give you right now is to ignore these fellas. They obviously want to cause unnecessary drama. If you ask for advice in the future, expect this response and simply ping a moderator and leave it at that. The channel description can be your reminder. Arguments like these are to be avoided even if it knocks you off of your high horse.
creations-chat 2022-03-09 00:14:12 People wait weeks for their ticket to be tended to
creations-chat 2022-03-09 00:14:35 All I can say is to avoid a futher waiting time is to supply us with **all** the info we need
creations-chat 2022-03-09 00:14:45 Avoid a back and forth response time in tickets.

Your tank isn't the depicted as the main build and thus technically not allowed. I suggest retaking the pictures actively showing your tank instead of someone else's A-10 👍
