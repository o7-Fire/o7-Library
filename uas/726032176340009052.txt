creations-chat 2023-03-27 20:09:26 DAMN
creations-chat 2023-03-27 20:11:35 don’t get me wrong the other one is good but i just think eskeline’s one is more realistic
creations-chat 2023-03-27 20:16:58 lol eskeline is better and funnier than yall
creations-chat 2023-03-27 20:19:44 shut up you know he’s an elite builder
creations-chat 2023-03-27 20:22:16 the one on the left right?
creations-chat 2023-03-27 20:25:44 hey man i tried
creations-chat 2023-03-27 20:29:28 shut up bitch
creations-chat 2023-03-27 20:33:36 i personally think eskelines office building deserves hall of fame, who handles the process to get in i would like to speak to them
creations-chat 2023-03-27 20:37:28 my ass someone like you could have a say in that
creations-chat 2023-03-27 20:39:36 you just hate eskeline because he’s better than you two, it’s actually laughable 😂😂

<@914605911744593930> then they are letting the wrong people win
creations-chat 2023-03-27 20:41:39 that’s decent, i would say it’s on the same level as jeff’s ship
creations-chat 2023-03-27 20:43:45 i would say im around the same level but they’re slightly better
creations-chat 2023-03-27 20:46:03 it takes a lot more skill to produce a custom design, it makes up for that in its slightly inferior looks
creations-chat 2023-03-27 20:49:41 LOL YOU CANT EVEN SPAWN A BUILD
creations-chat 2023-03-27 20:51:51 are you smoking something
creations-chat 2023-03-27 20:53:59 maybe he should just get good
creations-chat 2023-03-27 20:59:27 800 dollars to go towards more shitty unspawnable builds
creations-chat 2023-03-27 21:03:29 damn that’s horrible
creations-chat 2023-03-27 21:09:02 me and eskeline clearly won the argument here lol
creations-chat 2023-03-27 21:11:50 eskeline still remains a better builder
creations-chat 2023-03-27 21:14:00 everyone in this argument you blind fuck
creations-chat 2023-03-27 21:16:31 i’ve decided my newest project makes me a better builder than you, and now i’m going to look down on you
creations-chat 2023-03-27 21:18:51 they go from best to worst in downwards order lol
creations-chat 2023-03-27 21:20:57 all of you are jealous of eskeline, it’s obvious
creations-chat 2023-03-27 21:23:48 no eskelines ship shits on all of them
