plane-crazy 2020-03-17 14:00:07 I wonder if I should do the same.
plane-crazy 2020-03-17 13:59:50 My father intentionally calls it conoravirus to annoy people.
plane-crazy 2020-03-17 13:57:30 or you saw my contest submission or a creation or something.
plane-crazy 2020-03-17 13:57:19 Maybe there's another server we have in common or we've seen eachother in game.
plane-crazy 2020-03-17 13:57:01 I wonder...
plane-crazy 2020-03-17 13:56:24 Who, me?
plane-crazy 2020-03-17 13:56:04 *Is interested*
plane-crazy 2020-03-17 13:55:59 OOooh
plane-crazy 2020-03-17 13:55:37 Ah, makes sense.
plane-crazy 2020-03-17 13:55:19 While you're looking in here, I'm hoping on another battlebots event. :3
plane-crazy 2020-03-17 13:08:36 ...
plane-crazy 2020-03-17 12:58:23 No, he was rickje rolled.
plane-crazy 2020-03-17 12:58:11 Everyone just seems to spam missiles and other explosives in the current pvp servers, so I can never find a fair match for my preferred type of pvp creation.
plane-crazy 2020-03-17 12:57:22 I doubt it'd ever happen, but I'd really enjoy a pvp server that only allowed cutters.
plane-crazy 2020-03-09 20:00:59 btw a max density ballast beam is way heavier than a max density ballast block 7achyeet.
plane-crazy 2020-03-09 20:00:27 It feels like it's the case, since my faster creation's cutters seem to dish out a lot more punishment than their slower creation's cutters. (Even though they have 3x as many of them)
plane-crazy 2020-03-09 19:59:44 Does speed change the damage output of cutters?
plane-crazy 2020-03-09 18:31:54 True.
plane-crazy 2020-03-09 18:31:32 Thank you for letting me know.
plane-crazy 2020-03-09 18:31:13 In pvp mode, do the different material types take different amounts of shots to be destroyed?

plane-crazy 2020-03-02 14:42:23 I just went from 4 hover engines to 24, and now it reaches roughly 3000sps by the end of the track...
plane-crazy 2020-03-02 14:32:29 The hover engines are really fun to use, and they're even pretty effective for drag racing. Not as fast as glitch engines, but able to beat a lot of thrust spam builds by reaching 1000+ sps by the end of the track with just 4 of 'em.
Wonder if anyone's gotten them to go way faster... Probably.
plane-crazy 2020-01-10 15:24:13 Ah
plane-crazy 2020-01-10 15:20:38 How can I make a suggestion?
plane-crazy 2020-01-09 20:32:12 I'm glad somebody's agreeing with me on conveyor engine's superiority.
plane-crazy 2020-01-03 01:48:56 I just thought of a bad idea... Stacking conveyor engines.
plane-crazy 2019-10-01 09:27:19 It's not perfect, but it is a gimbal propeller by the look of it.
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 12:52:34 I've only found the front so far.
plane-crazy 2019-09-23 12:48:01 Where could I find the pontoon?
plane-crazy 2019-05-16 06:35:18 As long as the motors don't break badly enough to break my car/boat thing that can't drive on land but goes around 340 sps I'll be fine.
plane-crazy 2019-05-15 08:29:23 14.89 seconds to go the whole distance.
plane-crazy 2019-05-15 08:29:16 Also decided to time myself across the water.
plane-crazy 2019-05-15 08:28:59 btw I made a slight torque adjustment to reach 338.
plane-crazy 2019-05-15 08:28:38 No limit to the amount of motors, but no glitching with 'em.
plane-crazy 2019-05-15 07:54:10 I can get to 333 studs per second.
plane-crazy 2019-05-15 07:53:59 How fast can you guys go on water with just motors? :3
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 17:54:38 hmm
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 17:53:52 I've never bought robux and probably never will, but I somehow have 10 (I think from group donations or something.)
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 17:53:24 So I can get it for a month?
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 17:53:17 Most building games make lag bombs enough to ban.
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 17:52:57 Unless you're giving me robux, that's not going to be happening...
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 17:52:42 :\
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 17:51:40 Jensfrede's parachute spam car is causing lag.
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 17:51:27 Can something be done about this guy?
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 17:39:09 He under 13 obviously.
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 17:38:04 I want to report a lag bomber and have evidence for it, but I don't know where to send that evidence.
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 17:36:33 Where do I go to report things like lag bombers?
plane-crazy 2019-05-02 19:41:20 I just checked with a quick calculation... Turns out if you're going 500 studs per second you're only moving around 90kmh
plane-crazy 2019-05-02 19:40:12 ik
plane-crazy 2019-05-02 19:39:51 That makes things a lot slower considering a stud is said by roblox to be 5 centimeters...
plane-crazy 2019-05-02 19:38:31 Wait, what even is the speed measured in? (My guess is studs per second.)
