the-dump 2018-10-02 14:31:49 Yesn't Men't
the-dump 2018-10-02 14:31:55 That is the only counter.
the-dump 2018-10-02 14:33:22 Yesn't = no and men't = not me
the-dump 2018-10-02 17:52:05 Yesn't Men't
bug-reports 2018-10-07 16:38:58 Torque and pistons do not get along well with eachother...
help 2018-10-14 07:42:55 uhh, I just loaded and saved my paddle boat, but it went from 557 blocks to 558?
help 2018-10-14 07:43:03 I didn't add a block?
help 2018-10-14 07:44:28 Doesn't matter since ballasts working completely and utterly broke my boat, going to need to fix it. XD
help 2018-10-14 07:46:10 I fixed it by removing all but 1 ballast beam.
the-dump 2018-10-21 15:58:11 PINGPINGPING???!?/!??!
bug-reports 2019-05-11 10:18:27 The small blue car in the first image somehow launches the car in the second image decently far with ease.
bug-reports 2019-05-11 10:18:32 
bug-reports 2019-05-11 10:21:37 The brown build has over 200 max density ballast beams.
bug-reports 2019-05-11 10:22:52 (The brown build was just what I decided to make when I was sick of my ground vehicles being pushed around)
bug-reports 2019-05-11 10:29:15 I tried asking how that blue car did what it did but the creator of it didn't know.
the-dump 2019-06-08 16:51:54 
the-dump 2019-07-30 01:52:57 This is an actual serious message, and I want a lot of people to see it. I don't know how many will see it, or if anyone will spread the message, but here goes.
the-dump 2019-07-30 03:20:41 They can't script boi.
creations-chat 2019-09-23 13:01:16 This is what the mechanism used in my off roader looks like   when it's in build mode, pistons are used to push the "gears" together.
creations-chat 2019-09-23 13:01:36 I forgot it'd show as an image in creations lol
the-dump 2019-09-29 05:54:52 
creations-chat 2020-01-02 05:43:28 Conveyor Engine Plane (1000sps and near instant acceleration)
creations-chat 2020-01-02 05:59:26 Just throwing in context this time. Conveyor Engine plane.
Uses no fuel, can be more compact than magnet engines, 1000 SPS almost instantly with a consistent top speed and a controllable flight. This engine is perfect for pvp move due to the insane agility it provides.
creations-chat 2020-01-03 01:25:31 Turns out that the conveyor engine works reasonably well on boats, and the best part is that the size of the boat has a reasonably small impact on the engine!
the-dump 2020-01-09 20:32:50 *Blubs quietly*
creations-chat 2020-03-03 17:20:45 Is this a decent speed for my drag racing hovercraft to reach?
(It's powered solely by hover thrusters and the turning was made with a motor 2)
creations-chat 2020-03-05 14:03:43 Please tell me the player that literally built Waluigi has some kind of "building god" role or something along those lines for such a majestic creation.
the-dump 2020-03-08 19:23:43 I thought "Hoe mama" was a strong weapon...
the-dump 2020-03-08 19:24:02 THEN I MADE "Hoe mama 2"
the-dump 2020-03-08 19:45:28 I have created a couple of new weapons, a blaze rod and a piece of wheat.
the-dump 2020-03-08 19:46:45 I'm about to do exactly that.
the-dump 2020-03-08 19:47:05 I'll lightly tap myself with the yeet wheat and have a holiday on mars.
the-dump 2020-03-08 19:48:35 You'd need punch for that, not knockback.
bug-reports 2020-03-14 18:16:47 Don't know if this can be fixed, but the most recent update seems to have made displacement skyrocket... I'm being hit by cutters that didn't even come within 20 blocks of me repeatedly now, which almost never happened before.
help 2020-03-15 19:10:12 I intend on reporting a player for an innapropriate creation, would it get me in trouble to send the image of their creation in the report if I were to send it as a spoiler?
help 2020-03-15 19:11:48 nvm I can't send the image as an image, only as a link if I can figure out how...

help 2020-03-15 19:20:11 I believe that setting decides if your build starts anchored or unanchored when you test/use it.
help 2020-03-15 19:20:34 Physics being on makes it unanchored, and physics being off makes it anchored.

bug-reports 2020-04-06 19:46:55 I don't know how it's happening, but my friend's dropping to 2fps every time he goes on the floating island.
bug-reports 2020-04-06 19:47:11 I'm having less lag than before the update, which is what's confusing me.
bug-reports 2020-04-06 19:47:20 They went from 60 to 2 and I went from 20 to 40.
bug-reports 2020-04-06 19:47:24 (FPS)
bug-reports 2020-04-06 19:50:33 I don't get any lag at all from it.
bug-reports 2020-04-06 19:53:44 Seems like it's also the barn's fault.
bug-reports 2020-04-06 20:02:13 It's personal gravity.
the-dump 2020-04-07 12:13:24 
creations-chat 2021-07-01 12:32:23 Sure, I'll get one.
creations-chat 2021-07-01 12:34:30 How's a roughly 35 second video of it taking off, flying a bit, and landing?
Wait, am I allowed to send a link to a youtube vid here? I'd hope so.
How do I use streamable? nvm
Here's the vid then. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1eNEKAR_dk&ab_channel=Fishyfishking
creations-chat 2021-07-01 12:40:37 I think I'll keep on trying to make faster and faster ornithopters until I can't anymore lol
Running out of files though, so I might need to remove some of my less impressive old builds.
creations-chat 2021-07-01 13:44:18 I think that dragonfly ornithopter might actually be at a functional limit for ornithopters. Making the wings flap any more than they do on that ornithopter does not allow it to function effectively at full motor speed.
creations-chat 2021-07-01 15:26:26 Might try that lol
help 2021-07-02 13:04:39 How do I stop my build (symmetrical) from veering off to one side? It always veers off to the left despite being perfectly symmetrical (I quadruple checked)
help 2021-07-02 14:29:14 I managed to get it to function by lowering the angle the wings tilt at during the flap.
help 2021-07-02 14:29:26 It was the crow ornithopter.
help 2021-07-02 15:14:51 Help me kill this with fire.
creations-chat 2021-07-02 16:42:13 <@!297019145084469248> That's a very stable ornithopter you've got there. Mind sending a closer view of the mechanism used for it?


Who wouldn't upvote an axolotl? A monster?
help 2021-07-02 19:27:20 Yes, and a tank.
help 2021-07-02 19:27:36 An 8 winged ornithopter tank. It can drive and fly.
bug-reports 2021-07-03 13:50:39 I'm occasionally locked into a single part and unable to swap parts until I leave and rejoin. idk how or why it happens.

creations-chat 2021-07-05 15:58:18 Why is my bee getting so many <:Downvote:490311668556103700> ?
It's a functioning ornithopter, adding more detail would make it borderline impossible to get to fly without cheese.
creations-chat 2021-07-05 16:03:31 Tough crowd I guess.
creations-chat 2021-07-05 16:15:17 I did a thing.

creations-chat 2021-07-05 17:04:30 I didn't "forget" Ever heard of ornithopters hating being heavy? It barely flies as is.
Too much mass makes it impossible to fly with the wings it has, even if helium is added. Respect the limitations of that type of vehicle please.

<@!642324788429324301> Willing to show that mechanism from another side? It might be just what my ornithopters need if it also works on higher motor speeds.
creations-chat 2021-07-06 16:00:17 I mainly wanted the video to recreate it and try to slap it into an ornithopter.
creations-chat 2021-07-06 16:10:18 You could always mount a sword and be funny.
creations-chat 2021-07-06 16:13:24 I bet a 17 inch gun would be better.

Ah yes, the Fishy-Crashinator
(Somebody sent this in creations and that was my first thought lol)
That somebody is SovietCrimsonGlory
creations-chat 2021-07-14 13:52:05 Mhm
creations-chat 2021-07-14 13:55:48 1400 blocks is laggy for me lol
creations-chat 2021-07-16 22:47:27 I am concerned that my abomination got upvotes.
help 2021-08-02 08:09:50 I've seen it done a few times but idk how to set it up. How do you make a turret follow your mouse?
help 2021-08-02 08:15:46 What setting on it?
help 2021-08-02 08:17:31 That doesn't answer the question then...
help 2021-08-02 08:17:48 I'm asking how people have made turrets that can follow their mouse.
help 2021-08-02 08:23:59 What specific settings on the motor two allow for it to follow your mouse though?
help 2021-08-02 08:24:16 The default for it is F and R?
help 2021-08-02 08:24:40 Weird
help 2021-08-02 08:34:41 Conveyor engine.
