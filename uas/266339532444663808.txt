creations-chat 2020-03-08 03:50:10 Yes.
creations-chat 2020-03-08 03:57:05 What's the problem
creations-chat 2020-05-15 23:24:17 Four-banger moment.
creations-chat 2022-01-02 21:50:50 Why are there so many cutters on the spinner
Also, keep the wheelguards unless you want a horizontal swiping them.
creations-chat 2022-01-02 21:53:52 Plus, the ears are pointless if the bot can't drive inverted and the wedge is also pointless since it can easily come off, hinders the spinner's opportunity to hit and provides little to no ground game against other bots.
creations-chat 2022-01-02 21:57:19 If you want to have good ground game but still have an armoured wedge, I'd recommend using half wedges (wedges) and half wedge downs (half blocks). I'd also recommend using triangle wedges and triangle wedge blocks.
creations-chat 2022-01-02 22:00:00 For the part of the wedge that touches the ground, use Ice as the material. Does your bot have a self-righting mechanism of any kind
events-chat 2022-04-30 22:02:30 S2 Bombshell is a modular bot S4 isn't.
events-chat 2022-05-04 03:27:45 Did you make Switchback's arm thicker yet
events-chat 2022-05-04 03:29:01 Tombstone might or might not be comp.
events-chat 2022-05-04 03:29:28 It always sucked in a competitive setting.
events-chat 2022-05-04 03:29:45 In PC that is.
events-chat 2022-05-04 04:06:46 How big is the buff
events-chat 2022-05-04 16:26:22 Saws were never designed to punt unlike discs.
events-chat 2022-05-04 16:26:46 In what way
events-chat 2022-05-04 16:27:02 Them spinning doesn't equate to them working the same lmfao.
events-chat 2022-05-04 16:27:18 Bars = Disc because cutters!!!
events-chat 2022-05-04 16:27:39 Hey guys. If something has cutters on it, then that means they function the same way.
events-chat 2022-05-04 16:28:09 LOL
events-chat 2022-05-04 16:29:16 Uh, no they won't. The cutters on a disc are less as opposed to a saw.
events-chat 2022-05-04 16:29:52 Have you ever done BattleBots in Plane Crazy
events-chat 2022-05-04 16:30:15 Because it's obvious you haven't because "oh my god cutters means a saw and a disc are the same"
events-chat 2022-05-04 16:30:46 ^
events-chat 2022-05-04 16:32:41 Imagine using "whitename" as an insult.
events-chat 2022-05-04 16:32:59 You pull zero girls with that yee yee insult
events-chat 2022-05-04 16:34:16 By your logic, these are the same, right
events-chat 2022-05-04 16:34:47 Because they have cutters doesn't mean they're the same weapon, bro.
events-chat 2022-05-04 16:35:28 Mr. Obvious chimes in, woo
events-chat 2022-05-04 16:36:14 Playing PC doesn't equate to BattleBots knowledge.
events-chat 2022-05-04 16:43:20 One has less bite and was meant to cut. Not hard to comprehend.
events-chat 2022-05-04 16:44:07 You're not even situated with PC BattleBots ðŸ—¿
events-chat 2022-05-04 16:44:33 Never have I seen a saw be used as a ramming weapon. ðŸ’€
events-chat 2022-05-04 16:45:03 When was the last time I saw a saw on a PC BattleBot? Never
events-chat 2022-05-04 16:45:27 Not really. The league I'm in mostly uses it as overhead weapons.
events-chat 2022-05-04 16:45:44 I meant stationary saw. mb
events-chat 2022-05-04 16:46:33 So you said the Tombstone guy was allowed to break the rules, right
events-chat 2022-05-04 16:46:51 How far can he break it
events-chat 2022-05-04 16:47:30 Imagine if he works with 12 beams while everyone works with 1 <:stuff:908917207986208828>
events-chat 2022-05-04 17:51:47 That's literally the point. You basically just summarised it.
events-chat 2022-05-04 17:52:10 Who
events-chat 2022-05-04 17:52:32 He literally just proved us right by pointing out that saws do more DPS.
events-chat 2022-05-04 17:53:12 asked for your input
events-chat 2022-05-04 18:01:08 He's probably gonna have half of his bot be ballast beams or something
events-chat 2022-05-04 18:03:22 It'd probably be a shitpost if he started flinging <:FineTroll:626841259746656289>
events-chat 2022-05-04 18:04:46 The submissions are like decent so far.
events-chat 2022-05-04 18:05:10 The Bite Force is really good imo
events-chat 2022-05-15 18:21:39 Season 5 Mad Catter.
events-chat 2022-05-15 18:21:56 The one you posted is Season 6.
events-chat 2022-05-15 23:30:13 Is that the Judge
events-chat 2022-05-15 23:30:36 Didn't it get bodied by Tombstone
