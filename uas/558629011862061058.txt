The chain that is connected the belt loops around her waist, the chain in the back is connected to her hair like a scrunchie.

creations-chat 2022-04-24 13:55:05 Ah fair enough, I'm pretty much used to it, something similar happed before, back before I moved to PC there's a game that I used to play several years ago, **Cough** MachineCraft *AHem* which is a JP sandbox game which was basically a much more polished version of PC, all before the Dev (who can't speak english) dove the game to the ground.
creations-chat 2022-04-24 13:57:52 Point being, when it comes to sandbox game like these, be it Trailmakers, Beseige, ScrapMechanic, MachineCraft, Space Engineers, etc.. you WILL have that one person who does weebshit like these, and honestly? It's amazing that they even did it in the first place.

the-dump 2022-04-27 01:16:12 When you spawn into the world, there would also be a whale you can follow but it won't ever spawn again if it leaves your render distance, not sure if it's still a thing since that was 5+ years ago.
the-dump 2022-04-27 01:19:34 Uh, last time I followed it, it just passed through blocks and through land.

Pardon my garbage Spanish but doesn't the 2nd part indicate that you're 12 years old or does the 12 refer to something else? Because from context clues I'm assuming the former over the latter.
