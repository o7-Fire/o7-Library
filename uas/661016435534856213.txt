the-dump 2022-01-30 02:27:42 how many races of cars are there
the-dump 2022-01-30 02:28:23 why do taxis exist in the cars universe if theyre meant for people not cars?
the-dump 2022-01-30 02:29:42 not same race, same species
the-dump 2022-01-30 02:29:48 kinda different isnt it?
the-dump 2022-01-30 02:32:32 wait if they can breath and smell that proves they have organs
the-dump 2022-01-30 02:32:57

the-dump 2022-01-30 02:44:36 wait if theres older cars like the bottom one, does that mean entire races/ species of cars just die off as the world evolves or do they just change overtime? Can cars like the bottom one still be born but still act like modern cars?
the-dump 2022-01-30 02:45:12 do they build them?
the-dump 2022-01-30 02:45:55 how does aging work? do they somehow grow bigger or do they just stay the same size they were born/made at all their life
the-dump 2022-01-30 02:46:39 lizzie aint rusty tho, but theyre shown to be old
the-dump 2022-01-30 02:46:49 is rust a disease?

the-dump 2022-01-30 02:55:01 not a normal car
the-dump 2022-01-30 02:57:10 wait if theres trees and plants that proves that theres still biological life on the planet, so maybe theres still some type of insect or the cars are biological?
the-dump 2022-01-30 03:00:32 would the cars hold actual guns and weapons or is it built into them like in cars 2?
the-dump 2022-01-30 03:01:21 does that mean they are forced into a certain job from birth?
the-dump 2022-01-30 03:01:50 but i thought in some scenes they hold stuff with their tires
the-dump 2022-01-30 03:01:52 ?

the-dump 2022-01-30 03:05:19 i didnt even know it existed
the-dump 2022-01-30 03:07:20 the cars are biological, so does that mean theres other life on the planet somewhere?
the-dump 2022-01-30 03:08:07 i meant more like worms or something
the-dump 2022-01-30 03:08:16 there might be fish
the-dump 2022-01-30 03:08:41 small bee cars?
the-dump 2022-01-30 03:09:39 how do cars gets mods if theyre biological

creations-chat 2022-06-05 02:11:01 also, if u could only find low res images (even tho thats basically impossible) why not just try to build something else that u can get good images for? or just create a custom build?
