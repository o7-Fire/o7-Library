creations-chat 2019-07-09 17:37:12 (somewhat) functional differential, which in case you don't know what a differential does, lets the 2 wheels spin at different speeds depending on how much or how little resistance there is on each wheel
creations-chat 2019-07-09 17:41:52 for simplicity i used a jet engine on the free floating arm thing (idk the terminology well, just the mechanics) and that spins both half shafts
creations-chat 2019-07-09 17:42:22 it would have been a whole lot bigger to power the axle like it's done in real life, so i just didn't do it
creations-chat 2019-07-09 17:44:56 hey out of curiousity, since i just joined, has anyone figured out an effective way to do gears? that would be very helpful for multiple things
creations-chat 2019-07-09 17:45:07 oh idk i just didn't think it through
creations-chat 2019-07-09 17:45:20 cool
creations-chat 2019-07-09 17:48:23 is it in the creations channel? i'm looking for it rn but i'm just curious about the actual gears
creations-chat 2019-07-09 17:48:37 k i'll keep looking
creations-chat 2019-07-09 17:48:46 oh
creations-chat 2019-07-09 17:48:48 yeah im dumb
creations-chat 2019-07-09 17:48:49 thanks
creations-chat 2019-07-09 17:49:13 oh he just did gears the same way i did
creations-chat 2019-07-09 17:49:21 i learned nothing from that but thanks anyways lol
creations-chat 2019-07-09 17:52:06 Here's a dragster I made, it's not actually fast, like at all, but I'm pretty happy with how it looks
creations-chat 2019-07-09 18:00:02 yeah
creations-chat 2019-07-09 18:00:03 that
creations-chat 2019-07-09 18:00:15 that's just supposed to be the engine, it's decorative
help 2019-07-14 00:18:16 quick question, does a more sleek front actually make a difference in water? like actually making the craft more hydrodynamic
help 2019-07-14 00:43:01 gotcha, thanks
creations-chat 2019-07-14 01:40:06 Little 2 seater bi-plane I made, rocket engine hidden inside so it can actually fly lol.
creations-chat 2019-07-14 01:41:29 thanks üòÉ
creations-chat 2019-07-14 01:43:34 bruh
creations-chat 2019-07-14 01:45:31 but that's like big and stuff <:Thonk:509498568982134816>
creations-chat 2019-07-14 01:57:42 bruh moment
creations-chat 2019-07-14 02:34:25 *y'all saying under 2000 blocks is small, literally nothing i've ever built is over 1500*
creations-chat 2019-07-14 02:36:56 my largest craft in *physical* size is 250 blocks, i'm just now realizing the stuff i build is really small
creations-chat 2019-07-14 02:38:11 idk it's a good size vehicle, just not very complex
creations-chat 2019-07-14 02:38:39 my biggest vehicle in part count is 300
creations-chat 2019-07-14 02:39:04 i don't have the patience to build something with thousands of blocks tho
creations-chat 2019-07-14 02:39:43 my biggest vehicle is a land vehicle
creations-chat 2019-07-14 02:39:48 but like
creations-chat 2019-07-14 02:39:53 still, only 300 blocks
creations-chat 2019-07-14 02:40:02 then again i never finished the body work so it would be a lot higher
creations-chat 2019-07-14 02:41:10 what's a good color scheme for a boat
creations-chat 2019-07-14 02:41:19 i'm not creative
creations-chat 2019-07-14 02:48:42 big boat boi
creations-chat 2019-07-14 02:49:24 boat's deck
creations-chat 2019-07-14 02:51:00 yeah
creations-chat 2019-07-14 02:51:08 ):
creations-chat 2019-07-14 02:51:47 i don't build big, most of the time i only do mechanical stuff so trying to do aesthetics is very much not my thing, let me have my moment lmao
creations-chat 2019-07-14 02:53:19 had an idea to build a second hull the same size, probably extend them both out more, but then put an aircraft deck between it, it would be pretty small but i can have extensions fold out at the front and back
creations-chat 2019-07-14 02:55:09 that's actually a really nice plane
creations-chat 2019-07-14 02:59:03 not funny didn't laugh
creations-chat 2019-07-14 02:59:28 not didn't funny laugh
creations-chat 2019-07-15 21:12:01 im building my first aircraft carrier, should i try to add working aircraft elevators?
creations-chat 2019-07-15 21:12:18 i'd have to figure out some place to actually hold the planes but that shouldn't be hard
creations-chat 2019-07-15 21:13:02 for whatever reason i decided a catamaran aircraft carrier might be a cool idea but honestly i don't think it's going to be more interesting in any way than a normal one
creations-chat 2019-07-15 21:16:23 i don't even see how you would use ropes
creations-chat 2019-07-15 21:16:36 but i haven't played around with ropes at all so idk how they work
creations-chat 2019-07-15 21:17:13 yeah that's kind of what i was thinking
creations-chat 2019-07-15 21:20:42 you have motors rotated when building so a scissor lift might be kind of difficult but i could try that
creations-chat 2019-07-15 21:20:57 or i guess you could use wedges so it starts at an angle
creations-chat 2019-07-15 21:21:04 i don't build much complex stuff lol
creations-chat 2019-07-15 21:21:15 hm
creations-chat 2019-07-15 21:21:43 yeah
creations-chat 2019-07-15 21:21:44 ik
creations-chat 2019-07-15 21:21:55 i can just delete the carrier after saving it and experiment
creations-chat 2019-07-15 21:22:45 so far my carrier has 3-4 times as many parts as my second largest vehicle
creations-chat 2019-07-15 21:22:55 i don't build big things tho so it isn't hard to beat
creations-chat 2019-07-15 21:23:15 1k üòê
creations-chat 2019-07-15 21:23:26 yeah ik
creations-chat 2019-07-15 21:23:38 i'll probably reach like 3k with this when it's all done
creations-chat 2019-07-15 21:23:50 well i don't even have a deck yet
creations-chat 2019-07-15 21:23:53 and it's a catamaran
creations-chat 2019-07-15 21:23:56 so split hull
creations-chat 2019-07-15 21:24:40 i don't like talking here because everyone is way better than me and calls what i think is big small, very big sad
creations-chat 2019-07-15 21:25:49 my hulls are both hollow and idk if i'll put stuff in them
creations-chat 2019-07-15 21:31:43 my first boat was like a 200 block mini rescue boat thing
creations-chat 2019-07-15 21:31:50 it was literal garbage
creations-chat 2019-07-15 21:32:04 second boat wasn't much better, that one i actually posted here
creations-chat 2019-07-15 21:32:15 im just really not good at making things look good
creations-chat 2019-07-15 21:33:06 wtf
creations-chat 2019-07-15 21:34:38 lmao
creations-chat 2019-07-15 21:35:08 i usually focus on making things as small as possible because i usually build things like suspension mechanisms, now trying to build big is very different
creations-chat 2019-07-15 21:35:35 I feel like i can realistically finish this carrier
creations-chat 2019-07-15 21:35:45 it's so much bigger than anything i've done but im dedicated
creations-chat 2019-07-15 21:36:54 lmao
creations-chat 2019-07-15 21:37:21 any suggestions or ideas on what a carrier realistically needs? i don't know a lot about boats
creations-chat 2019-07-15 21:37:37 i know it needs a deck, a hull, and a super structure, but what are some other essentials
creations-chat 2019-07-15 21:38:06 the *what*
creations-chat 2019-07-15 21:38:22 oh yeah no i'm not working out that mechanism lmao
creations-chat 2019-07-15 21:38:53 yeah ik what you're talking about
creations-chat 2019-07-15 21:40:14 my carrier is so stubby, because i wanted to make it a catamaran i needed a fair amount of space between the 2 hulls and now it looks really short when in reality it's really not
help 2019-07-15 21:43:45 I know that's not what this channel is really for, i just don't really want this image in the creations channel. How does this look as far as length? I can add a second fold to help it if it's too short
help 2019-07-15 21:46:29 fair enough
help 2019-07-15 21:47:01 alright gimme a minute to save
creations-chat 2019-07-16 16:03:14 that's really nice, that looks cool
creations-chat 2019-07-16 16:59:28 that's really nice
creations-chat 2019-07-16 17:03:22 Here's my Catamaran Aircraft Carrier, it's not the biggest or most impressive aircraft carrier but I'm super proud of this and it's the biggest thing I've ever built, about 3.6k blocks.
creations-chat 2019-07-16 17:04:40 Some decorations inside the command room thing
creations-chat 2019-07-16 18:02:44 thanks üòÉ
creations-chat 2019-07-16 20:27:16 you can just request a role with something you build? lol
creations-chat 2019-07-16 20:58:47 holy heck that thing flies really well
creations-chat 2019-07-17 00:34:56 Here's an F-16 I made, 390 blocks, so somewhat small. straight line top speed of 415.
creations-chat 2019-07-17 00:38:43 off to a great start, 2 downvotes yee haw
creations-chat 2019-07-17 00:39:15 I thought it was pretty close to the real thing but i guess not lol
creations-chat 2019-07-17 00:40:10 yeah ik
creations-chat 2019-07-17 00:40:28 i didn't expect it to be the best anybody had seen by any means, i just wanted it to be accurate
creations-chat 2019-07-17 00:40:42 personally im happy with it and that's all that really matters
creations-chat 2019-07-17 00:43:05 here's a picture with higher graphics settings so you can see the shape a little bit better
creations-chat 2019-07-17 00:51:09 ngl i am a little, i was really proud of it. idk what i expected tho this server has really high standards
creations-chat 2019-07-17 00:51:24 yeah ik
creations-chat 2019-07-17 18:43:30 overall i like the ship, but yeah i agree with ^^
creations-chat 2019-07-17 18:47:24 im uneducated, what's a vsp?
creations-chat 2019-07-17 19:24:12 i kinda doubt it but it's worth asking, i did a mechanical differential a little while back and i just did a search and it looks like im the only person that has done it, would i be able to get inventor rank for that?
creations-chat 2019-07-17 19:27:33 lol
creations-chat 2019-07-17 20:22:23 kinda want to try and do a 747, i already know it's gonna be bad but somebody pick an airline company, i wanna do the seating layout and everything but every airline company does something slightly different
creations-chat 2019-07-17 20:23:52 mk
creations-chat 2019-07-17 20:23:54 thanks
creations-chat 2019-07-17 20:26:09 lol
creations-chat 2019-07-17 20:26:22 yeah this is gonna be bad, prepared for many downvotes but i wanna challenge myself
creations-chat 2019-07-17 20:27:18 i don't know planes well so im literally just doing the first result for "air canada 747"
creations-chat 2019-07-17 20:27:26 *i'm extra screwed*
creations-chat 2019-07-17 20:29:20 yeah ik it's just the plane i know well bc it's popular
creations-chat 2019-07-17 20:29:48 yeah im using regular images, i ain't going through the trouble to use blueprints
creations-chat 2019-07-17 20:29:53 idrc
creations-chat 2019-07-17 20:58:46 oh absolutely
creations-chat 2019-07-17 20:58:50 still looks nice imo
creations-chat 2019-07-17 21:01:06 I really want to try making more mechanical things but i just don't know what mechanism to try
creations-chat 2019-07-17 21:04:34 ive done that ._.
creations-chat 2019-07-17 21:05:59 that's a good idea
creations-chat 2019-07-17 21:06:27 i don't really have any large planes but i could try it anyways
creations-chat 2019-07-17 21:35:05 lol
creations-chat 2019-07-17 21:37:47 i just like building mechanical stuff
creations-chat 2019-07-17 21:37:52 it's not for any particular reason
creations-chat 2019-07-17 21:37:59 i just like understanding how it works i guess
creations-chat 2019-07-17 22:51:55 i just remade the 5 blocks plane and it actually flies really well, i'm impressed lol
help 2019-07-18 18:07:19 a copy and paste feature would actually be super useful
help 2019-07-18 18:11:11 kind of like what ksp does with their sub assembly things if i remember correctly, where you save a set of blocks that can then be imported and placed as one
help 2019-07-18 18:11:46 it's been a while since i've played but from what i can tell sounds like that's basically what you're describing lol
creations-chat 2019-07-18 19:20:51 i tried building a B2 spirit and i regret it so much
creations-chat 2019-07-18 19:21:02 it's so bad and it's the worst flying thing i've ever made
creations-chat 2019-07-18 19:21:29 i had to give in and give it little vertical stabilizers just so it will fly at all so sadly i couldn't stay true to the original design
creations-chat 2019-07-18 19:21:38 
creations-chat 2019-07-18 19:22:06 lesson learned, just *don't*
creations-chat 2019-07-18 19:22:19 hey wtf
creations-chat 2019-07-18 19:22:34 why
creations-chat 2019-07-18 19:25:18 yeah same
bug-reports 2019-07-18 20:19:41 i hate when the motors bug out lol, i have a wishbone suspension mechanism where if it's too soft or too tall than every bump you hit it launches into the air
creations-chat 2019-07-18 21:13:53 This super ugly plane is my first VTOL, i'm expecting loads of downvotes on this but i just love how this flies and wanted to share.
creations-chat 2019-07-19 17:14:25 ok
creations-chat 2019-07-19 21:08:07 all out of inspiration, what am i buildin' fellas
creations-chat 2019-07-19 21:08:47 oh i didn't even know there was a contest ._.
creations-chat 2019-07-19 21:09:23 im not good at building big things, even something like an airliner, i'm not gonna submit for this one
creations-chat 2019-07-19 21:09:54 the biggest thing i've done was that below average size aircraft carrier
creations-chat 2019-07-19 21:09:59 so yeah, no big things
creations-chat 2019-07-19 21:32:45 for whatever reason i decided a fish plane would be a good idea. i was wrong but here it is anyways.
creations-chat 2019-07-19 21:37:06 that actually looks pretty cool all around, the propeller housings look a little odd tho
creations-chat 2019-07-20 01:46:11 what the heck
creations-chat 2019-07-21 18:10:56 i actually really like the idea of a miniature airliner, considered building my own to experiment, but that one isn't very accurate imo
creations-chat 2019-07-21 18:58:09 gonna try a 737 with realistic seating, already got economy and business class laid out and I didn't realize how much space it's going to take up lol
creations-chat 2019-07-21 19:03:48 lol, that's pretty cool actually
creations-chat 2019-07-21 20:26:34 because as we all know, trebuchets are superior to catapults
creations-chat 2019-07-21 20:55:04 why the heck is there no half triangle wedges
creations-chat 2019-07-21 21:00:23 it's genuinely annoying
creations-chat 2019-07-21 23:37:14 that's pretty bad
creations-chat 2019-07-22 02:37:17 (resubmitted because i forgot to put image and text in the same message) Spent all day making this 737-600, livery based off of Scandinavian airlines.
creations-chat 2019-07-22 02:39:27 oh, in all the pics i saw they were
creations-chat 2019-07-22 02:39:34 ohhh
creations-chat 2019-07-22 02:39:37 easy mistake to make
creations-chat 2019-07-22 02:39:44 sorry lol
creations-chat 2019-07-22 02:40:16 based the seating off some random seating chart for the same plane i found online lol. 110 seats, 102 economy and 8 business class seats in the front
creations-chat 2019-07-22 02:40:29 not the most attractive room ._.
creations-chat 2019-07-22 02:41:50 and here's the business class section, not based off any real business class irl i just built what i could with the space
creations-chat 2019-07-22 16:30:47 looks cool
creations-chat 2019-07-23 00:08:00 A bunch of people in my server were doing rescue boats, so i did the same. it's nicknamed the Watchdog-1035. Can house 10 people long term, so an entire server.
creations-chat 2019-07-23 00:09:12 Decorative kitchen in the lower floor of the superstructure
creations-chat 2019-07-23 00:12:06 forgot to mention above, top speed of about 220, block count is 1035
creations-chat 2019-07-23 00:23:06 fair, i think there is a few things on the outside that could look a lot better
creations-chat 2019-07-23 00:59:29 yeah thats fair
creations-chat 2019-07-23 01:50:46 your welcome lol
creations-chat 2019-07-23 01:50:52 i thought it looks nice
creations-chat 2019-07-23 01:50:55 so you get an upvote
help 2019-07-23 16:35:04 i have a wooden model  on my desk
help 2019-07-23 16:35:12 right in front of me rn
help 2019-07-23 16:40:22 hey i really want constructive criticism on my boat from yesterday, I already like it a lot but there's a lot of room for improvement, but I didn't want it going into the creations channel so im posting it here. What are some specific things i can improve on this?
https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/504436696021204992/603015415416881153/unknown.png
help 2019-07-23 16:42:02 well i mean, it kind of was. I'm not good at building structures like that
help 2019-07-23 16:42:19 that's why i'm asking how i can improve it lol
creations-chat 2019-07-23 18:20:22 Spent some time upgrading my rescue boat from yesterday. Swiveling high power search lights on the front, long term housing for 12 people including a barracks area, eating area, and kitchen. 1135 blocks, top speed of 228.
creations-chat 2019-07-23 18:21:25 bc
creations-chat 2019-07-23 18:21:27 it's fun
creations-chat 2019-07-23 18:21:29 ok
creations-chat 2019-07-23 18:21:31 oh*
creations-chat 2019-07-23 18:21:32 lol
creations-chat 2019-07-23 18:21:36 because people dont like it i guess
creations-chat 2019-07-23 18:21:45 thanks
creations-chat 2019-07-23 18:21:50 i really like this version personally
creations-chat 2019-07-23 18:22:05 something i can say i'm proud of, which isn't many of my builds
creations-chat 2019-07-23 18:22:54 lol
creations-chat 2019-07-23 18:23:03 i think extending it out backwards helped a lot with that
creations-chat 2019-07-23 18:23:05 looks more realistic
creations-chat 2019-07-23 18:23:14 and i moved all the housing areas inside the main structure
creations-chat 2019-07-23 18:23:22 lol
creations-chat 2019-07-23 18:24:30 rip
creations-chat 2019-07-23 18:25:39 that tank really doesn't have much shape
creations-chat 2019-07-23 18:25:43 idk what else to say
creations-chat 2019-07-23 18:26:30 hm
creations-chat 2019-07-24 18:55:18 oh yeah
creations-chat 2019-07-25 15:45:49 i really want to try building a 747 with realistic seating, the only problem is that with the seating charts i've seen it would have to be a minimum of 14 blocks wide and idk if i can build a plane at that scale yet lol
creations-chat 2019-07-25 15:51:41 i could, but the whole point is realistic seating
creations-chat 2019-07-25 15:51:42 so i wont
creations-chat 2019-07-25 15:51:44 ._.
creations-chat 2019-07-26 22:13:11 currently trying to do a realistic seating 747 like i did with the 737, giving me a new appreciation of how big this plane is
creations-chat 2019-07-26 22:13:29 just the business class section in the front so far is taking up half the build space
creations-chat 2019-07-26 22:13:38 probably not gonna finish this project
creations-chat 2019-07-26 22:40:56 too many
creations-chat 2019-07-26 22:40:57 too many blocks
creations-chat 2019-07-26 22:41:13 with most seating configurations it would have to be a minimum of 14 blocks wide
creations-chat 2019-07-26 22:41:18 13 if the walls are half blocks
creations-chat 2019-07-26 22:41:51 the 747 is a massive plane and it isn't feasible to build it in this game true to real life, i realized that quickly and deleted what i had
creations-chat 2019-07-26 22:45:42 just went back and checked the ranks thing and realized i already meet the requirements for a couple of them <:Thonk:509498568982134816>
creations-chat 2019-07-26 22:46:31 Requesting master engineer, capable of flight (obviously), top speed over 500 and the block count in the next image
creations-chat 2019-07-26 22:46:48 block count for the 737
creations-chat 2019-07-26 22:46:55 yeah i just never knew i could get ranks for it
creations-chat 2019-07-26 22:47:17 didn't think about that
creations-chat 2019-07-26 22:47:43 sorry, probably should've clarified in the post that i had posted it before
creations-chat 2019-07-26 22:47:48 didn't think that through well üòê
creations-chat 2019-07-26 22:48:42 yeehaw first rank
creations-chat 2019-07-27 00:07:35 i think you're right, i went back and looked at it, i'm thoroughly impressed and kind of want to revisit the 747
creations-chat 2019-07-27 00:32:05 today i learned you can copy speed setting from ropes and put it on wheels, just made a car that goes 650
creations-chat 2019-07-27 00:32:41 i knew it could be done on motors but i never tried wheels
creations-chat 2019-07-27 00:32:47 just playing around with this now lol
creations-chat 2019-07-27 00:33:23 neat
creations-chat 2019-07-27 01:45:27 might try doing a binary adder tomorrow
creations-chat 2019-07-27 01:45:39 i'll have to do some research on the mechanics
creations-chat 2019-07-27 01:45:46 good job on yours tho
creations-chat 2019-07-27 14:23:28 any of my boats should be able to fit that
creations-chat 2019-07-27 14:23:55 i don't know much about the mechanism and would probably stay with normal propulsion though
creations-chat 2019-07-27 14:34:55 can i get master designer for a joke plane <:Thonk:509498568982134816>
creations-chat 2019-07-27 14:36:15 the rank requires 20
creations-chat 2019-07-27 14:36:35 i kinda doubt that'll count since i kinda sorta built the plane as a joke
creations-chat 2019-07-27 14:40:03 hm, maybe i will get it
creations-chat 2019-07-27 14:40:06 i wob'
creations-chat 2019-07-27 14:40:08 wow
creations-chat 2019-07-27 14:40:10 enter button ok

creations-chat 2019-07-27 20:25:44 built my most reliable differential yet, i've built significantly smaller before but they had serious reliability issues and typically just didn't work well but this one does consistently work.
creations-chat 2019-07-27 20:26:24 oh dang i was gonna post a video but the file size is too high
creations-chat 2019-07-27 20:34:17 it seems like im still the only person to have done a differential, does that qualify for inventor? lol
creations-chat 2019-07-27 20:39:51 yeah
creations-chat 2019-07-27 20:39:54 its more friction

creations-chat 2019-07-27 22:40:59 a 200 block vtol isnt that impressive
creations-chat 2019-07-27 22:54:08 i did a request for master designer earlier and it was never acknowledged by a mod ;-;
creations-chat 2019-07-27 23:18:34 there's so many extra wedge pieces that could be added that would make planes look so much smoother
creations-chat 2019-07-27 23:18:46 but noooope i have to make the nose of my plane a blocky mess
creations-chat 2019-07-27 23:38:53 idk it's a little odd

creations-chat 2019-07-28 01:00:03 that's weird

creations-chat 2019-07-28 02:15:36 working on something big, hoping i can get it flying bc it should qualify for server exterminator lol

help 2019-07-29 16:07:21 ok, thanks
help 2019-07-29 16:07:43 even though i want thicker wings, because of how this folds i might not be able to, it might look pretty awkward
creations-chat 2019-07-29 23:32:00 i accidentally took my goal of getting the server exterminator rank seriously
creations-chat 2019-07-29 23:32:05 i crashed an entire server
creations-chat 2019-07-29 23:40:42 idk, rolled hard left to try and turn and suddenly my speed went into the billions, everything looked weird and my game froze
creations-chat 2019-07-29 23:41:07 rejoined the server bc my friend was in it, he had the same experience and now there's only 3 people left in it bc everyone left
creations-chat 2019-07-29 23:41:25 i didn't *technically* crash a server, but it was reaaal close
creations-chat 2019-07-29 23:45:50 lol

creations-chat 2019-07-30 22:28:11 in my opinion this is my best looking vtol that I've made, top speed around 250, 3 extra passenger seats and a small cargo bay with a hatch on the back to load in cargo
creations-chat 2019-07-31 02:17:01 ^^^
creations-chat 2019-07-31 16:55:51 shape is very nice, does need to be painted tho lol

creations-chat 2019-08-01 19:07:38 house plane is coming for you
creations-chat 2019-08-01 21:12:01 even more reliable differential than the one i did last week, this time with a 1:5 gear ratio, geared for torque, meaning the output of a single motor is roughly equal to 5k torque. Also has a limited slip mechanism, preventing all of the power from going to a wheel not even on the ground.
creations-chat 2019-08-02 17:35:57 lol
creations-chat 2019-08-02 20:35:52 2 Speed transmission. I'm fully aware that a 4-speed transmission has been done before but what's unique about this one is that the gears actually deploy with a clutch sleeve like on real transmissions, shown in next pics
creations-chat 2019-08-02 20:37:14 First gear, you can see the pistons extended pushing a friction block into the correct gear to engage it.
creations-chat 2019-08-02 20:38:12 And the same thing for second gear. Second gear is less reliable but i  plan on redoing this as soon as i figure some things out.
creations-chat 2019-08-02 20:48:10 bruh
creations-chat 2019-08-02 20:48:18 i searched and couldn't find anything wtf
creations-chat 2019-08-02 20:50:33 i searched gearbox too, and i searched 4 speed to find the one i already knew someone did
creations-chat 2019-08-02 20:50:44 in the 4 speed one there wasn't a clutch sleeve from what i could see
creations-chat 2019-08-02 20:51:05 bruh
creations-chat 2019-08-02 20:51:24 absolutely massive bruh moment
creations-chat 2019-08-02 20:51:44 well dang now im sad
creations-chat 2019-08-02 20:52:05 i spent all that time experimenting just to make something that sort of works, only to find out someone has already done it, and done it well
creations-chat 2019-08-02 20:52:14 ._.
creations-chat 2019-08-02 20:52:28 absolutely dead inside
creations-chat 2019-08-02 20:53:23 at least i don't a differential? so i can probably still say i'm the only person to have done that
creations-chat 2019-08-02 20:53:27 don't see*
creations-chat 2019-08-02 20:54:09 then again everything is so big on that i can't tell
creations-chat 2019-08-02 20:54:54 yeah no i dont see a differential
creations-chat 2019-08-02 20:55:12 i can say with reasonable certainty that nobody else on the discord has done that
creations-chat 2019-08-03 18:08:07 hey wmvs aren't allowed
creations-chat 2019-08-03 18:32:32 looks good imo, it's kind of hard to make a thin fuselage look circular

creations-chat 2019-08-08 18:06:48 yeah ok im sorry, it looks like some effort went into it but it just doesn't look that good
creations-chat 2019-08-09 02:02:44 pistons are very useful for various mechanisms
creations-chat 2019-08-09 02:03:25 if they're being moved around quickly they may extend unintentionally
creations-chat 2019-08-09 02:03:29 it only sort of makes sense tho
creations-chat 2019-08-12 16:32:59 i literally *just* realized they changed the ranks
creations-chat 2019-08-12 16:33:02 when did that happen
creations-chat 2019-08-12 16:39:08 i need more ranks, i have decided
creations-chat 2019-08-12 16:39:12 lol
creations-chat 2019-08-12 16:46:08 bruh
creations-chat 2019-08-12 16:46:16 i hate when that happened

creations-chat 2019-08-12 16:56:53 This is my ugly wishbone suspension track car, but where it lacks in looks it more than makes up for in function. Top speed around 300 sps, and it turns roughly the same or better than an irl formula 1 car, absolutely insane handling and I'm genuinely very proud of this car.
creations-chat 2019-08-12 16:57:09 oh yee haw still no upvote and downvote
creations-chat 2019-08-12 18:12:24 <@!561734378758340649> it's really compact and reliable, chill
creations-chat 2019-08-12 18:12:43 so what if it doesn't *look* like traditional wishbone suspension
creations-chat 2019-08-12 18:16:52 oh yeah and i didn't even think about the fact that it was built on top of another vehicle and i extended it in an awkward way, you're probably seeing the part that connects the wheel and not the actual mechanism, or so i would hope
creations-chat 2019-08-12 18:22:57 the reason i extended the wheelbase in the first place is because of a problem that i fixed in development of that car so i'm reverting it now
creations-chat 2019-08-13 01:24:26 Here's my mildly disproportionate P-51 mustang, fully prepared for downvotes. 223 blocks, top speed around 220.

creations-chat 2019-08-13 19:42:26 he left

creations-chat 2019-08-16 20:29:09 i gotta agree with him, the shape is really weird for a sub
creations-chat 2019-08-16 20:29:23 they are usually very rounded for a reason
creations-chat 2019-08-16 20:29:46 ok, but it still looks odd
creations-chat 2019-08-16 20:30:06 you could just build a pile of random blocks and that could be "your imagination" but it would still be garbage
creations-chat 2019-08-16 20:30:27 idrc that much tbh
help 2019-08-16 20:33:43 i highly doubt it, but it's worth asking. does the game have ground effect?

help 2019-08-17 20:25:43 how do i do custom control surfaces, it's easy to do a whole panel of wings tilting like a horizontal stabilizer but how do i have just the rear section of a wing tilt
help 2019-08-17 20:26:11 wow ok i never thought of that ._.
help 2019-08-17 20:36:32 well yeah, but what if it's a swept wing (like on the plane im trying to put it on)
help 2019-08-17 20:37:21 decided to just tilt the wing tips instead to save some complexity, all good

bug-reports 2019-08-24 20:13:28 old cars were cool and ornate
bug-reports 2019-08-24 20:13:46 yeah
bug-reports 2019-08-24 20:14:05 we could never replicate the look of them, they're a very different style generally and it's entirely up to personal preference

help 2019-08-25 16:24:22 I've never done a vehicle with treads, just curious how most people tension them? I'm trying one now and idk what to do really
help 2019-08-25 16:44:22 i think i'll use an extra roller above the main tread like i've seen on some vehicles, i think it'll look cool
help 2019-08-25 16:44:23 thanks tho
help 2019-08-25 16:44:38 i also explained that poorly  but whatever lol
help 2019-08-25 18:18:23 in my experience the 1x1 2s have more thrust but are heavier
help 2019-08-25 18:18:52 like in my fastest boat that i have i tried switching all the super rocket engines in it for water props and it never got as fast because of all the added weight
creations-chat 2019-08-26 01:16:43 nothing to see here...
creations-chat 2019-08-26 01:27:49 twin differential tank chassis, front and rear axles have differentials which again, lets the 2 sides of the axle turn at different speeds. for this particular application of the mechanism i'm basically running tank drive with only one drive motor per axle. I obviously haven't put a body on this yet but it's already close to 1200 blocks.
creations-chat 2019-08-26 01:28:21 forgot to say in first message but the big gray blocks on the sides are just helium to help support the weight of the track on the tensioner
creations-chat 2019-08-26 21:35:54 obviously not, it's the best car
creations-chat 2019-08-26 21:36:11 that is the best car ever dude

creations-chat 2019-08-29 20:11:06 <@335176451038904331> you need to use different size wedges depending on the gap that needs to be filled, using all 1x1s basically looks the same and it's still super jagged and not smooth
creations-chat 2019-08-29 20:11:19 I like the overall vehicle but the details are important
creations-chat 2019-08-29 20:36:50 honestly i wish there was at least a game pass for more save space
creations-chat 2019-08-29 20:37:02 i really dont want to make an alt just to build more stuff
creations-chat 2019-08-29 20:37:35 rip moment
creations-chat 2019-08-29 20:38:29 surely there's some way to at least optimize it so each block takes less space but idk how that stuff works
creations-chat 2019-08-29 20:39:03 i've made some simple games but never with any saving system so idk
creations-chat 2019-08-29 20:39:46 cool

creations-chat 2019-08-30 00:50:00 first one imo
creations-chat 2019-08-30 00:56:39 oof moment
creations-chat 2019-08-30 15:36:53 in case it wants to kill itself
creations-chat 2019-08-30 15:37:20 yeah, it probably wants to kill itself
creations-chat 2019-08-30 15:49:51 a cargo hold?
creations-chat 2019-08-30 15:50:11 that doesn't sound difficult and i don't think it would make anything unstable
creations-chat 2019-08-30 15:50:22 unless it's a really small vehicle i guess?
creations-chat 2019-08-30 18:32:56 i would feel kind of bad for downvoting the pen just bc it's already got a few upvotes but like, i really don't like it
creations-chat 2019-08-30 18:33:17 like even as a joke creation it's a really disproportionate pen
creations-chat 2019-08-30 20:33:15 mk you should stop posting the same thing over and over again
help 2019-08-30 22:11:16 um yeah that's kind of slow, i would guess that it's more to do with balance though
help 2019-08-30 22:11:17 idk
creations-chat 2019-08-31 00:46:34 lmao
creations-chat 2019-08-31 00:46:48 looks pretty nice i guess but it's really not a big plane
creations-chat 2019-08-31 18:39:46 just figured out that waterwheels can be used as gears, since there's only one size i'm trying to figure out what this can be useful for ü§î
creations-chat 2019-08-31 18:47:14 im gonna try using waterwheels in a differential, but i don't think it will have any serious advantages over a friction cylinder differential, maybe very slightly better power transfer?
creations-chat 2019-08-31 18:47:54 yeah
creations-chat 2019-08-31 18:48:15 many suspension pieces to get it positioned right but it might be worth it, differentials in this game tend to have slip issues
creations-chat 2019-08-31 18:48:25 yeah
creations-chat 2019-08-31 18:48:30 im gonna see what i can do
creations-chat 2019-08-31 18:54:32 well holy shit that wasn't hard at all, i think i just made my most compact differential ever
creations-chat 2019-08-31 18:55:16 i will in one sec
creations-chat 2019-08-31 18:55:21 i gotta do some more testing
creations-chat 2019-08-31 18:55:34 it's literally like 4 blocks wide
creations-chat 2019-08-31 18:55:46 and fits inline on 5x5 cylinders
creations-chat 2019-08-31 18:55:53 so like, a normal sized car
creations-chat 2019-08-31 18:55:55 not a giant one
creations-chat 2019-08-31 18:56:07 yeah idk if it'll actually work on a moving car
creations-chat 2019-08-31 18:56:27 it be like that sometimes lol
creations-chat 2019-08-31 18:56:37 differentials really aren't useful in this game
creations-chat 2019-08-31 18:56:39 it's just for fun
creations-chat 2019-08-31 18:57:32 yeah
creations-chat 2019-08-31 19:01:21 kind of having some weird issues rn but i can fix it probably
creations-chat 2019-08-31 19:05:42 im so freaking confused, the wheels should be turning in the same direction with the input im giving to the differential but one goes backwards
creations-chat 2019-08-31 19:05:59 literally the gear connected to that wheel is rolling forward and the wheel isn't
creations-chat 2019-08-31 19:11:56 ok
creations-chat 2019-08-31 19:15:38 ok
creations-chat 2019-08-31 19:21:09 noice
creations-chat 2019-08-31 19:22:23 gg
creations-chat 2019-08-31 19:25:03 it be like that sometimes
creations-chat 2019-08-31 19:28:08 ok
creations-chat 2019-08-31 19:31:04 dang that looks fancy
creations-chat 2019-08-31 19:31:19 idk if it's any better than just double wishbone but it looks cool
creations-chat 2019-08-31 19:36:55 yeah it's a bit over the top
creations-chat 2019-08-31 19:40:00 Here it is boys, the absolute smallest differential i could build. Locking motors have a glitch where they compress slightly when locked as long as they don't rotate and so i can abuse that and pull the water wheels closer together, this is really tiny and probably shouldn't work at all but here ya go lol
creations-chat 2019-08-31 19:40:49 i feel like it would look a lot better if it was a bit stiffer and the ride height was higher
creations-chat 2019-08-31 19:40:53 but yeah looks pretty good
creations-chat 2019-08-31 19:42:55 <@!291746312599240704> i posted the diff
creations-chat 2019-08-31 19:44:00 i mean, there's not much to see
creations-chat 2019-08-31 19:44:04 it just rotates lol
creations-chat 2019-08-31 19:44:21 locking motors are insanely useful, you can use it like a short suspension to pull things together but in a 1x1x1 space
creations-chat 2019-08-31 19:44:50 cool
creations-chat 2019-08-31 19:45:03 i don't use locking motors often, but they are very useful
creations-chat 2019-08-31 19:45:27 but anyways yeah the smaller you make differentials the less reliable they are so this one is uh, not great
creations-chat 2019-08-31 19:45:40 it is very fast though
creations-chat 2019-08-31 19:45:52 i don't have to worry about the gears slipping loose from each other
creations-chat 2019-08-31 19:46:00 so it tops out at like 150 when my others will do 60
creations-chat 2019-08-31 19:47:44 yeah
creations-chat 2019-08-31 19:47:52 but i don't use the water wheels for input so
creations-chat 2019-08-31 19:48:26 yeah

creations-chat 2019-09-06 01:16:33 Video of it running, if you know how engines work you may notice the valves fire in the right order like a real I4, genuinely very proud of this.
creations-chat 2019-09-06 01:18:37 what did you build?
creations-chat 2019-09-06 01:18:51 fair enough
bug-reports 2019-09-06 22:48:56 locked motor
bug-reports 2019-09-06 22:49:00 that's a known issue
bug-reports 2019-09-06 22:49:28 if you know how to use it to your advantage it can actually be useful but just in general it's a pain
bug-reports 2019-09-06 22:58:04 what do anchor blocks have to do with locking motors? they always do that for me
bug-reports 2019-09-06 23:02:02 yeah same for me
bug-reports 2019-09-06 23:02:13 but holy heck i've never seen one compress that much
creations-chat 2019-09-07 20:05:22 Proof of concept 1 speed waterwheel transmission, if more sizes of waterwheels were added it would be insanely easy to expand on this idea, but sadly there IS only 1, and so it's not very practical.
creations-chat 2019-09-07 20:09:03 yeah i know it sucks, thanks for downvote lol
creations-chat 2019-09-07 20:09:17 there's a legitimate reason it's better but i can't expand it since there's only 1 size
creations-chat 2019-09-07 20:11:08 the thing is that the cyllinder in the middle is connected all the way through, and there's a setting to make them free spinning. On a real transmission the gears on the countershaft are freespinning and then engage seperately mechanically
creations-chat 2019-09-07 20:11:22 my engaging mechanism is that half piston on the bottom
creations-chat 2019-09-07 20:11:38 so mechanically it's exactly how irl transmissions work and it's super compact
creations-chat 2019-09-07 20:11:51 but again, i just don't have the parts to expand it
creations-chat 2019-09-07 20:12:23 in general transmissions are very large, so that would still be useful even in large vehicles
creations-chat 2019-09-07 20:17:41 currently dogfighting a guy in his biplane with my table
creations-chat 2019-09-07 20:19:08 yes
creations-chat 2019-09-07 20:21:46 bruh
creations-chat 2019-09-07 20:22:03 nvm
creations-chat 2019-09-07 20:22:03 so im allowed to share my creations but not what i do with them? actually that's reasonable
creations-chat 2019-09-07 20:22:50 to be fair you could also like, chill a bit
creations-chat 2019-09-07 21:49:46 looks good
creations-chat 2019-09-07 22:52:28 Another proof of concept waterwheel transmission, this time a 3 speed. The ratios are 1:3, 1:1, and 5:3. This i think shows the potential of waterwheels significantly better in mechanical builds. For first and second gear I'm using the edges of blocks to mesh with the waterwheel instead of other waterwheels, technically you could create even higher ratios with the same method if you wanted to.
creations-chat 2019-09-07 23:02:50 Here's a video of the transmission cycling through gears
bug-reports 2019-09-07 23:07:59 that's known
bug-reports 2019-09-07 23:08:03 and not *really* a bug
creations-chat 2019-09-09 20:45:25 i've been considering making one of those for a while i just didn't think i had any reason to
creations-chat 2019-09-09 22:00:13 <#478584971670454284>
creations-chat 2019-09-09 22:51:25 ^
creations-chat 2019-09-09 23:33:02 wide
creations-chat 2019-09-10 20:47:53 those are both kinda ugly ngl
creations-chat 2019-09-10 23:26:34 (i was just gonna spam A in the title but mee6 wouldn't let me smh my head) Ax131, 1300 blocks, top speed 0
creations-chat 2019-09-10 23:27:20 thank
creations-chat 2019-09-10 23:27:34 ok
creations-chat 2019-09-10 23:58:47 Fairly compact double wishbone suspension chassis, might turn this into a monster truck
creations-chat 2019-09-11 00:43:41 thanks i get that a lot
creations-chat 2019-09-11 01:21:42 miniature fighter jet with a built in ejector seat, i'll post a video of the ejector seat in a minute
creations-chat 2019-09-11 01:24:52 Here you can see the seat launching out, the canopy quickly unfolds to let the seat out. it's propelled by a suspension piece that's locked with a disconnector so as soon as the disconnector disconnects it releases the tension and launches violently. You can also see the decorative flare lol
creations-chat 2019-09-11 01:25:39 from a stand still on the ground the ejector can easily get enough height for the parachute to deploy so it can also be used if there's some problem during take off
creations-chat 2019-09-11 20:44:17 it be like that sometimes
creations-chat 2019-09-12 01:21:46 This is my attempt at making a McDonnel XF-85 Goblin, it's got a few issues but all things considered with the space constraints i set for myself, i think it's pretty good. It's about 130 blocks and has a top speed around 400.
creations-chat 2019-09-12 23:50:16 that landing gear is for like, really big planes apparently
creations-chat 2019-09-12 23:50:39 like that's excessively large, i dont think anybody has a plane that would realistically fit that
creations-chat 2019-09-13 01:14:46 ok
creations-chat 2019-09-18 21:30:47 what
help 2019-09-18 23:46:00 what does a motor's speed value have to be to turn one time every second
help 2019-09-18 23:46:14 rip im interrupting lol
help 2019-09-18 23:46:44 yeah that's fair
help 2019-09-18 23:46:52 gonna be difficult to get my timer perfect tho lol
help 2019-09-18 23:46:57 i'll just have to estimate
help 2019-09-18 23:48:31 turns out it's about 5
help 2019-09-18 23:53:18 yeah i've seen both things done
help 2019-09-18 23:53:26 well at least the first, the second one is really simple though
creations-chat 2019-09-19 20:15:20 dang that vtol is really cool
creations-chat 2019-09-20 21:52:05 that's not even plane crazy chief
creations-chat 2019-09-20 21:52:13 "thosm"
creations-chat 2019-09-20 21:52:14 what
creations-chat 2019-09-20 21:52:22 no?
creations-chat 2019-09-20 21:52:36 this.. is a plane crazy server
creations-chat 2019-09-20 21:52:40 post plane crazy content not studio
creations-chat 2019-09-20 21:52:46 absolutely lol
creations-chat 2019-09-20 21:53:01 ok
creations-chat 2019-09-21 00:27:11 literal garbage
creations-chat 2019-09-21 21:26:05 that sounds pretty terrible
bug-reports 2019-09-22 19:09:30 its a bug
creations-chat 2019-09-22 21:43:46 timer thing, all runs on a single drive motor that spins the second hand, then gears down 1:60 for the minute hand, then gears down 1:60 again for the hour hand
creations-chat 2019-09-22 21:44:42 and all the gears underneath
creations-chat 2019-09-23 21:29:30 it's not worthy of inventor
creations-chat 2019-09-23 21:29:34 it just isn't
creations-chat 2019-09-23 21:29:37 no need to get salty
creations-chat 2019-09-23 21:36:03 <@232694074501496833> is it like, actually useful? not really
creations-chat 2019-09-23 21:36:21 like ok, it's kind of cool i guess, but you have to do something really impressive for inventor
creations-chat 2019-09-23 21:37:07 ok, but it's not like crazy impressive
creations-chat 2019-09-23 21:37:13 anybody with a bit of experience can do that
creations-chat 2019-09-23 21:37:36 basically nobody is given inventor anymore afaik
creations-chat 2019-09-23 21:38:18 oh wow i just went back and actually watched the video
creations-chat 2019-09-23 21:38:31 yeah there's literally no chance of getting inventor from that, what were you expecting
creations-chat 2019-09-23 21:39:40 there is no criteria
creations-chat 2019-09-23 21:40:02 it's just for doing something really impressive, usually having something to do with mechanics and that kind of thing
creations-chat 2019-09-23 21:40:16 and what you did isn't remotely impressive
creations-chat 2019-09-23 22:19:54 controlling a rocket with your cursor is like super easy
creations-chat 2019-09-23 22:26:29 logic gates would be super cool but like, imagine how much save space they would use
creations-chat 2019-09-23 22:26:47 not to mention any sort of interface
creations-chat 2019-09-23 22:43:10 i do kind of wish there were better defined requirements for inventor ngl
creations-chat 2019-09-24 22:33:57 definitely made in plane crazy
creations-chat 2019-09-25 22:39:53 Vertical volute suspension, i haven't put it on any vehicle yet but it seems to work pretty well so i might build a tank around it.
creations-chat 2019-09-26 00:20:51 not familiar with borderlands
creations-chat 2019-09-26 00:22:10 oh yeah that looks pretty similar
creations-chat 2019-09-27 20:58:31 that's so bad im sorry
creations-chat 2019-09-27 20:59:06 that is one of the worst creations i've ever seen ._.
creations-chat 2019-09-27 20:59:24 im sorry but maybe dont post that kind of thing?
creations-chat 2019-09-28 21:00:10 nice
creations-chat 2019-10-07 22:11:40 nice
creations-chat 2019-10-07 22:12:11 oh that's really cool actually
creations-chat 2019-10-07 22:12:21 too bad the voting thing didn't show up
creations-chat 2019-10-11 01:12:12 **this thing**
creations-chat 2019-10-11 21:30:26 tried my best to make a magnet engine look good, i think it turned out pretty well.
creations-chat 2019-10-11 21:37:22 1
creations-chat 2019-10-11 21:37:29 it's a single suspension piece and a single magnet
creations-chat 2019-10-11 21:38:00 because the suspension is short the magnet pulls a lot harder, works pretty well
creations-chat 2019-10-11 21:39:50 lol
creations-chat 2019-10-11 21:40:18 i have a slightly longer version that just looks like a normal jet engine for the  most part but i think i like the smaller one ngl
creations-chat 2019-10-14 02:14:35 yeah you gotta show exterior chief
creations-chat 2019-10-14 02:14:42 as far as interior, it looks decent i guess
creations-chat 2019-10-17 23:52:27 :/
creations-chat 2019-10-26 19:03:34 thank you kind sir
creations-chat 2019-10-26 21:01:41 this same one has been posted before
creations-chat 2019-10-26 21:01:44 <:Thonk:509498568982134816>
creations-chat 2019-10-26 21:01:54 ...why
creations-chat 2019-10-26 21:02:18 and you expect it to get more upvotes this time?
creations-chat 2019-10-26 21:02:43 if you really think you're deserving of a rank and that's what you care about then dm a mod
creations-chat 2019-10-26 21:03:15 not angry i just dont think you should
creations-chat 2019-10-26 21:03:59 because everything has been done before lol
creations-chat 2019-10-26 21:04:11 ..it has
creations-chat 2019-10-26 21:04:18 i saw a walking city like 3-4 weeks ago maybe?
creations-chat 2019-10-26 21:04:29 yeah they've been around for a while
creations-chat 2019-10-26 21:04:54 it's the same concept with more stuff
creations-chat 2019-10-26 21:05:03 yours is
creations-chat 2019-10-26 21:05:08 np
creations-chat 2019-10-26 21:05:16 i upvoted the original if it makes you feel any better
creations-chat 2019-10-26 21:06:32 counter rotating engines aren't hard
creations-chat 2019-10-26 21:06:43 i've made a working gearbox
creations-chat 2019-10-26 21:07:03 ^
creations-chat 2019-10-26 21:07:21 very big issue with any of my gearbox designs
creations-chat 2019-10-26 21:07:29 output power is at best around 1% of the input
creations-chat 2019-10-26 21:09:01 i tried using magnets in gearbox applications, i wont go in to detail, but even with their ridiculous strength it isn't enough for some things
creations-chat 2019-10-26 21:09:29 oh yeah no suspension isn't nearly stiff enough at 100
creations-chat 2019-10-26 21:09:39 imo 100 should be perfectly stiff like a block
creations-chat 2019-10-26 21:10:28 mindflayer i'll give you an upvote just because of my experience with the same thing, it's dissapointing because you make something that you think is really accurate and cool and it gets downvotes
creations-chat 2019-10-26 21:10:56 ^
creations-chat 2019-10-26 21:11:11 i dont mind it, if in my book it's deserving of an upvote then im gonna give it an upvote
creations-chat 2019-10-26 21:11:49 yeah i had an f-16 that i though was awesome and it was so much fun to fly and then it got loads of downvotes lol
creations-chat 2019-10-26 21:12:13 it be like that sometime
creations-chat 2019-10-26 21:12:21 oh neat
creations-chat 2019-10-26 21:12:22 that's new
creations-chat 2019-10-26 21:12:50 it's actually uncommon to see new things at this point that's pretty awesome lol
creations-chat 2019-10-26 21:14:32 go for it
creations-chat 2019-10-26 21:14:38 make what you wanna make chief
creations-chat 2019-10-26 21:16:31 most mechanical builds are ugly
creations-chat 2019-10-26 21:16:56 yep
creations-chat 2019-10-26 21:18:18 see pinned messages in creations
creations-chat 2019-10-26 21:18:22 whole bunch of designs
creations-chat 2019-10-26 21:20:20 neat
creations-chat 2019-10-26 21:20:28 looks like a sprocket to me lol
creations-chat 2019-10-26 21:21:12 if all you care about is power transfer and not ratios, waterwheels make fantastic gears
creations-chat 2019-10-26 23:38:00 ?
creations-chat 2019-10-27 00:42:55 ok but do you know yuri?
creations-chat 2019-10-28 19:46:52 i dont think it looks very good, sorry chief
creations-chat 2019-10-28 19:47:15 it be like that sometime
creations-chat 2019-10-28 19:47:31 what
creations-chat 2019-10-28 19:47:38 i... don't like it, so i downvoted
creations-chat 2019-10-28 19:47:44 that's the only reason you should ever downvote?
creations-chat 2019-10-28 19:48:13 ^
creations-chat 2019-10-28 19:48:44 it's generic, fairly boxy, the cockpit looks odd, the big cylinder things at the top are also a little odd
creations-chat 2019-10-28 19:49:32 like i just don't see anything special about it
creations-chat 2019-10-28 19:49:38 it's *just* a heli
creations-chat 2019-10-28 19:50:14 because the thing as a whole is attractive or it's non-coaxial (which in case you don't know is extremely difficult)
creations-chat 2019-10-28 19:50:40 ^
creations-chat 2019-10-28 19:50:51 ok
creations-chat 2019-10-28 19:51:08 for one, i didn't know that, and 2 coaxials are still super easy and kinda boring
creations-chat 2019-10-28 19:51:16 and honestly, i'm not great with helis so idk
creations-chat 2019-10-28 20:05:30 ok
creations-chat 2019-10-28 20:05:46 if you like it then upvote, but i don't so i'm gonna downvote
creations-chat 2019-10-28 20:14:44 ok but im gonna downvote it because i decided i wanted to
creations-chat 2019-10-28 20:15:05 ok
creations-chat 2019-10-29 21:06:33 doesn't even look like a schlatt coin smh
creations-chat 2019-10-29 21:38:14 looks kinda stubby, overall pretty nice
creations-chat 2019-10-29 21:38:26 almost looks like a toy mustang
creations-chat 2019-10-29 21:38:44 ohhh ok
creations-chat 2019-10-29 21:38:52 well i guess that would make sense then
creations-chat 2019-10-29 21:39:46 yeah it does look short
creations-chat 2019-10-29 21:40:00 if it were longer it would look better
creations-chat 2019-10-29 21:40:32 lmao
creations-chat 2019-10-29 21:40:46 yeah that's a big part of it for sure
creations-chat 2019-10-29 21:46:02 aircraft carriers are easy if you don't care for them to look super good
creations-chat 2019-10-29 21:46:16 can still make something look decent and it's not hard
creations-chat 2019-10-29 21:46:42 mechs are a bit harder, VTOLs aren't that bad and helis are only hard if you want to make it non-coaxial
creations-chat 2019-10-30 20:30:40 nice
creations-chat 2019-10-30 21:27:31 it's ok
creations-chat 2019-10-30 23:33:09 cute mini airliner üëå
creations-chat 2019-11-02 02:09:29 "Linear drone/helicopter" concept, basically whenever each wing is moving out from the center it's producing lift but when they return to the center they fold flat, it cycles back and forth to create a small amount of fairly consistent lift
creations-chat 2019-11-02 02:10:18 ok it's just a concept and it says it right in the name
creations-chat 2019-11-02 02:10:29 i'm not trying to get ranks or anything
creations-chat 2019-11-02 02:10:37 i just couldn't make it light enough to lift off the ground without it
creations-chat 2019-11-02 02:10:55 not really
creations-chat 2019-11-02 02:11:19 i guess it's closer to an ornithopter than a helicopter or drone
creations-chat 2019-11-02 02:11:31 but it's not really flapping its wings so idk
creations-chat 2019-11-02 02:11:59 wasn't my goal but ok
creations-chat 2019-11-02 02:12:23 ohh i get what you're saying
creations-chat 2019-11-02 02:12:35 hey raq
creations-chat 2019-11-02 02:12:54 ok
creations-chat 2019-11-02 02:12:57 lol
creations-chat 2019-11-02 18:43:45 <@!308304989183279105> that vtol is gorgeous, great job
creations-chat 2019-11-02 18:45:48 <@!302698900521877504> it's not really needed, but it can make steering easier
creations-chat 2019-11-02 18:46:39 ok but it's an easy method to turn left and right
creations-chat 2019-11-02 18:47:07 you *can*, but it's more intuitive to use a tail rotor
creations-chat 2019-11-02 18:47:55 ok
creations-chat 2019-11-02 18:49:43 i think im gonna try optimising my linear drone better today, i'm not really happy with my final result from yesterday
creations-chat 2019-11-05 22:12:23 made a boeing a while back, was pretty ugly and only really built it for the size, but it had a 14 block diameter fuselage and it ended up around 7000 blocks, if you hit 10k with a 9 block diameter idk how i would feel
creations-chat 2019-11-05 22:12:44 o k
creations-chat 2019-11-14 21:38:17 ^
creations-chat 2019-11-14 21:38:26 it's a cute little prop plane
creations-chat 2019-11-14 21:38:27 very nice
creations-chat 2019-11-16 20:50:30 what
creations-chat 2019-11-22 00:16:15 thanos truck thanos truck
creations-chat 2020-04-22 02:08:26 A very muscular robot.
creations-chat 2020-04-22 02:11:42 i feel like you kinda put my robot to shame lol
