and making it one or one and a half makes it looks disproportionate
creations-chat 2021-08-26 03:39:04 What things on the side the cutters or the snow blaster?

its angle lock
creations-chat 2021-08-26 03:52:50 They slightly dismantle it to make it glow

you can scale a plane to anything

<@!739369649971527720>  looks great
creations-chat 2021-09-14 06:14:02 Question are the wings too big?
creations-chat 2021-09-14 06:16:37 I just used regular google images
creations-chat 2021-09-14 06:19:17 So are you saying they look fine or they are to big on my plane?

oh ok sorry
creations-chat 2021-09-14 06:24:27 they are already a half block  into the plane so...idk

ok thanks for the feedback
creations-chat 2021-09-14 09:20:52 Why are you using half down on the back it looks weird and maybe move the rudders a half block

<@!760578875163410432> the blocks below the rudders arent connected to the rudders
creations-chat 2021-09-14 09:38:01 Right ,left looks kinda weird idk
creations-chat 2021-09-14 09:44:10 Still gonna pick right
creations-chat 2021-09-14 10:10:08 Looks very nice I might attempt something like it on mine
creations-chat 2021-09-14 10:16:06 nice
creations-chat 2021-09-14 10:48:20 Landing gear too long I guess but it looks nice
creations-chat 2021-09-14 11:02:06 Should I extend the nose or decrease the wings?
creations-chat 2021-09-14 11:53:34 Is there anything  I should fix?

So how should I fix it?
creations-chat 2021-09-14 12:53:57 Which looks better

1.
creations-chat 2021-09-14 12:56:12 2.
creations-chat 2021-09-14 12:58:29 Ok thank you I will now go and delete 2 from my save file

creations-chat 2021-09-15 06:13:17 It also makes a fun challenge
creations-chat 2021-09-15 09:36:44 <@!633281581347504129> to much exposed lock and the body looks a little funky
creations-chat 2021-09-15 09:46:14 looks fine
creations-chat 2021-09-15 10:00:52 looks verry poggers
creations-chat 2021-09-15 10:15:49 yeah and set it to powered and lock but getting it to the neutral position might be hard
creations-chat 2021-09-15 10:23:52 Motor 2's wont work but reg motors would maybe but they won't work un;ess there is a block inside the motor I think idk

creations-chat 2021-09-16 07:54:28 also what is this
creations-chat 2021-09-16 11:51:58 fix this part please its just a missing wedge and a block that is sticking out
creations-chat 2021-09-16 11:56:35 better tis a bit smoother
creations-chat 2021-09-16 12:50:43 I extended the engines a bit do they fine?

creations-chat 2021-09-16 12:53:22 what...
creations-chat 2021-09-16 13:04:38 ok thank you, I cant move them out of the engines since the engines help hide some of the motors and some of the stabilizers parts but I can try and remove the motor since it's just a half block
