plane-crazy 2020-07-25 00:59:09 i NEED IT!
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 00:59:06 1.65x92
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 00:01:31 this is a moment
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 00:01:29 
plane-crazy 2020-07-17 06:46:42 DUDE WATCH OUT HE Nows WHERE ALL OF US live
plane-crazy 2020-07-17 06:46:34 
plane-crazy 2020-07-14 20:30:34 wtf
plane-crazy 2020-07-12 03:45:33 interesting
plane-crazy 2020-07-11 23:26:19 i dont think you understand
plane-crazy 2020-07-11 23:26:11 bruh
plane-crazy 2020-07-11 23:25:55 the hitch and the bed need to have a rigit connection once connected
plane-crazy 2020-07-11 23:25:42 no
plane-crazy 2020-07-11 23:25:41 but plane crazy currently has no good way to connect and disconnect things
plane-crazy 2020-07-11 23:25:24 you seperate the hitch and the bed of the trailer to load things on to it
plane-crazy 2020-07-11 23:25:14 thats just how lowboy trailers work
plane-crazy 2020-07-11 23:25:07 no
plane-crazy 2020-07-11 23:24:44 it needs to be a rigid connection
plane-crazy 2020-07-11 23:24:36 i said that because its simpler to understand
what i need is magnets that can make it so the hitch of the trailer and the trailer bed can seperate and connect without moving sideways
plane-crazy 2020-07-11 23:23:53 but not for what im doing
plane-crazy 2020-07-11 23:23:44 i did
plane-crazy 2020-07-11 23:23:24 the magnets wont seperate
plane-crazy 2020-07-11 23:23:21 these are my magnet settings
plane-crazy 2020-07-11 23:22:29 ill try magnets
plane-crazy 2020-07-11 23:14:36 is there any possible way for me to make it so my truck hitch can connect & disconnect to the trailer on command
plane-crazy 2020-07-10 06:15:08 wait... https://gyazo.com/d4f08afcc8b69840c7994a6d1cf7a2db

plane-crazy 2020-06-30 13:38:38 aok
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 05:38:01 nvm its cuz i got 50 upvotes
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 05:37:04 how did i gert designer 3
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 17:03:45 i did but its confusing
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 17:03:36 just post a picture of the build and part number?
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 17:03:27 what do i do to get the terrain specialist 1 rank
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 17:00:41 ok
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 16:58:18 pistons but they can be moved like suspension + rope
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 16:58:06 to go with that hydraulic pistons
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 16:57:18 small motors basically
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 16:57:06 like a small bearing
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 16:56:50 so on smaller builds if you want something to freely spin it doesnt look stupid and bulky
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 16:56:31 another thing i think we need is small hinges
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 16:53:57 quarter blocks needed
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 16:53:41 exactly
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 16:53:40 yes
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 16:49:46 its a half wedge not a normal wedge
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 16:49:41 this is a normal block for comparison
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 16:49:36 
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 16:47:05 plane crazy needs a half wedge but just a block
plane-crazy 2020-06-28 01:45:48 bruh
plane-crazy 2020-06-28 01:45:05 is there this but half block
plane-crazy 2020-06-28 01:45:00 
plane-crazy 2020-06-24 04:57:27 shouldnt the red part be underwater
plane-crazy 2020-06-24 04:15:00 also gotta love this
plane-crazy 2020-06-24 04:05:18 gotta love it
plane-crazy 2020-06-24 01:23:38 how stiff
plane-crazy 2020-06-24 01:23:30 i know iamobbyman but that takes up alot of space
plane-crazy 2020-06-24 01:23:18 and it's annoying
plane-crazy 2020-06-24 01:23:12 its super bouncy
plane-crazy 2020-06-24 01:22:58 this is my truck and it uses the suspension block
plane-crazy 2020-06-24 01:21:38 the strut
plane-crazy 2020-06-24 01:21:36 inside of the springs
plane-crazy 2020-06-24 01:21:30 
plane-crazy 2020-06-24 01:21:15 let me elaborate
plane-crazy 2020-06-24 01:20:02 and it's not efficient for cars unless it's gigantic
plane-crazy 2020-06-24 01:19:49 because trying to make realistic suspension in plane crazy takes a lot of space to make
plane-crazy 2020-06-24 01:19:27 my point is i wish we had suspension that behaved more realistically, you could add the hydraulic compressy thing that is usually inside of the spring
plane-crazy 2020-06-24 01:18:28 yes i understand
plane-crazy 2020-06-24 01:18:12 hydraulics and leafsprings and shit
plane-crazy 2020-06-24 01:18:05 i know
plane-crazy 2020-06-24 01:17:38 but not like in plane crazy
plane-crazy 2020-06-24 01:17:34 well it does
plane-crazy 2020-06-24 01:17:25 when you go over a bump in a car it doesnt bounce
plane-crazy 2020-06-24 01:17:15 suspension that doesn't bounce like crazy
plane-crazy 2020-06-24 01:16:44 man i wish we had more realistic suspension
plane-crazy 2020-06-24 00:06:09 has the physics update happened yet
plane-crazy 2019-12-30 16:46:35 Has anyone made an airplane with an engine made out of motors
plane-crazy 2019-12-24 16:46:27 Hhbvbvvcxxzxzxcvvvbhhk
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 23:32:47 k nvm i got it
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 23:32:44 oh thats what i was missing
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 23:31:39 when i tried it flung my plane
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 23:31:33 i have no idea how to though
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 23:30:41 can someone guide me on how to make the motor 2 gun thingy
