bug-reports 2018-12-29 14:46:22 My friend's got an issue, his creations keep glitching out when unfolded and it bugs him out with the motors when they are on infinite torque.
bug-reports 2018-12-29 14:47:58 Alright, thanks rickje.
creations-chat 2018-12-31 04:58:34 So I've finally tried out this game and it's actually nice, I've made a small plane which is basically the tutorial plane modified but it's my design, 17 blocks and requesting Beginner role. Dollar_Dollar1 is my username.
creations-chat 2018-12-31 05:04:41 Thank you.
creations-chat 2018-12-31 05:05:23 What about those divider roles? Where it shows which category of ranks my roles are?
creations-chat 2018-12-31 05:39:39 Fun, could I get this rank?
creations-chat 2018-12-31 05:40:20 Well, kind of a divider role more than a rank...
