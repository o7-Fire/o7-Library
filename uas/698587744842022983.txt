bot-central 2021-05-10 01:30:20 Oh yay
creations-chat 2021-10-12 18:29:22 This is the sad truth, time =/= good
creations-chat 2021-10-12 18:31:59 I would add more texture and details with materials tool, I dont think scrapper is that clean in the actual movie
creations-chat 2021-10-12 18:37:28 The thing is a lot of newer players spend hours and days on 1 rlly bad build since they lack experience and don’t know how to repurpose blocks and add detail then complain that their build gets torn apart in <#384025409945337856> even tho they spent a ton of time and put in effort. Then you have players who have a few hundred hours in the game who spend like half an hour putting together a plane with huge amounts of detail and historical accuracy (assuming it’s a replica not an original design) with their knowledge of the game and how to use blocks to their full potential get tons of likes.

TL:DR
Effort + time =/= good
creations-chat 2021-10-12 18:40:36 Effort and time **can** result in a better build and **usually** will but it doesn’t guarantee that your build is good, I’m just saying you can’t spend 7 hours putting together a giant cargo plane missing slopes, not using curves, and the end result looking like something out of 2019 babft and expect ppl to love it

<@!401530469952389130> what
creations-chat 2021-10-12 18:42:38 ^^^

Also size =/= good
creations-chat 2021-10-12 18:45:55 All of these things **can** contribute to a better build if used properly, there’s no direct correlation with any building technique and “good”. Also <#384021699466756107> pls, the cooldown on this is killing me
creations-chat 2021-10-12 18:54:30 Detail ~ good

Poorly executed detail (detail in all the wrong places) can look like shit cuz it draws the eye to the unimportant parts of your plane

Also in pvp functionality>everything else, being able to hit hard while being hard to hit/dumb amount of tnt armor>4k blocks of detail and a 5 story motor lock tower
creations-chat 2021-10-12 18:58:34 Blacklist + rocket accelerator turret (cant find video but just makes rockets spin stupidly fast around a central shaft and they go far and fast)
creations-chat 2021-10-12 19:05:08 I think it is pilot size, its just a lot closer to the camera than the ring plane

creations-chat 2021-11-05 12:39:06 Feedback(I’ll get some pics on computer later) I’m switching the color pallet since green and grey is boring, that’s why there’s a bit of yellow in the back. The entire build is me having fun with the skis since I never use them, I’m gonna add more detail to the armor and fix the main gun, the reason why big gun is so thicc is bcuz there’s 8 guns in there, I’ll motor lock them into a more skinny gun later. I made this purely focusing on performance in pvp which is why all detail went to hell.

**features** 
1 forward lava spitter (in the hull)
1 spinning lava spitter (force field lol)
10 guns in 2 separate turrets
12 rockets, 8 on a main turret and 4 spread across 2 gun turrets
2 spinning cutter wheels (anti shredder bug)
More cutters along the entire front section bcuz yes
Entire front section has tnt armor (covered up bcuz tnt ugly) 
Back section can be disconnected if the turrets are knocked (no point carrying extra weight)
No wheels so there’s no weak point to target
Only way to kill it is to kill the chair or shred it

creations-chat 2021-11-08 18:10:50 I would use somethign else to represent the wingtip missiles, the half wedges look a bit unrealistic

If possible hide the landing gear

Add more color variety since pure grey looks drab

Overall a good plane, nice to see an f16 that obviously doesnt follow that 1 tutorial that everyone does
creations-chat 2021-11-08 21:40:48 I would like to hug it

Actual feedback tho

Nose could be improved with a bit of locking

The slope of the back is a bit steep, the back of the mirage barely slope at all (think f4 phantom)

The roof of the Jesko is a lot less pointy irl

Not sure how to say it properly but the back part of the cabin….? starts sloping in a lot earlier and the curve is less steep (yellow is excess/just follow the back line)

I’m giving detailed feedback for this since its a nice dino, you just need to add some detailing and improve the marketing/stop begging for hof

1st of all, shit camera angle, keep in mind this isnt roblox anymore, we cant look around and get different angles, thats up to you to capture the best angles and show those angles to us. Can we maybe get a front view, top down, or build mode? (Take some hints from current hof builds)

2nd, give a more detailed explanation of your build, not just begging for hall of fame (look at some in hof rn, the latest mech is a pretty good example)

3rd, adding a diorama (background) is a nice way of making ur build look nicer (examples below)
https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/384025409945337856/909389679579766855

https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/627195143040139264/905557303615451216

4th, begging for hof makes you seem like a baby, a build worthy for hof doesnt require any begging/pleading, it will naturally get its upvotes and work its way into hof

5th, add textures, dinosaurs typically don’t look like plastic, making it all the default texture makes it look fake (take hints from the stone turtle and the crab in <#627195143040139264>)
creations-chat 2021-11-15 21:42:49 Where’s the upvote button for the cow lol
creations-chat 2021-11-15 21:45:22 The vote bot doesnt even recognize this as a build lmao
creations-chat 2021-11-19 00:51:24 I doubt being a massive target is effective in pvp, unless your goal is to be target practice for people testing airplanes, in which case thank you for your sacrafice
creations-chat 2021-11-21 02:16:39 Tell us the fucking difference

Stop squeaking and being a bitch about people having opinions that are well founded

Deal with shit and improve
creations-chat 2021-11-21 02:20:00 <@!811110046069948416> cone of arc brought this to ur attention? I saw the vid too lol, looks fucking awesome

Only feedback is that it could use some detail (probably hard to find detailed pictures of an obscure tank), it just looks a bit “plasticy” and cartoonish
I would try to fix it by adding details found on tanks of that era, no one said it has to be perfect to reality since that tank was mainly just a concept, have creative freedom and keep it up 👍

creations-chat 2021-11-26 00:30:11 <@!414359638302130176> can we get a top down? Body looks amazing but the wings r a bit weird
creations-chat 2021-11-26 00:35:24 Don’t forget about that part, but you could probably ignore it if you want since it’s barely noticeable

I think with a bit more detail and refining the shape it could probably get in hof
creations-chat 2021-11-27 20:50:59 1 you admitted to the suspensions being the same thing "calling the suspension trash will count as hars suspension trash because theyre both the same thing"

2 he said it himself its a simple suspension, the fact that you failed to copy it and then had the fucking audacity to call it your own is just outright plagarism

3 even though you credited hars doesnt fix the issue, hars never gave you the permission to post your almost identical build which you admitted was the same.

creations-chat 2021-12-04 18:50:00 this looks more like a modern 6 wheel apc than any sort of tank, 1st of all ur missing a ton of wheels, and 2nd it looks far too wide and not long enough to be a t55. Take the critism and improve or just give some excuses and cry like most people in <#504436696021204992> when they get real feedback instead of the sugarcoated shit their mother gives them, on the plus sides tho, the color scheme is nice and the general shape is there

<@!497073919547670528> it’s definitely a below average build, im not saying the builder sucks, they might be newer to the game and that’s ok, but if you post your build and just deny any feedback and refuse to accept that it’s below standards, that simply called being a child
creations-chat 2021-12-07 20:46:37 This is exactly what I meant about him being unable to accept actual feedback, if your fragile ego can be shattered by a bunch of online people on a roblox plane game after **YOU** posted your build for judgement, who’s fault is that

creations-chat 2021-12-07 20:49:19 Was typing actual feedback but since you classified yourself as a brick wall and are unable to accept real suggestions, then go repeat the cycle of building, posting, and crying with your roomba
creations-chat 2021-12-07 20:54:36 Either way, heres feedback if you ever swallow ur ego and c o p e <@!750712383227428945> 

1. wings look like cheese graters, use motor flaps

2. Most planes aren’t pure angelic white, there always gonna be some dust/dirt, make it darker/add texture with materials 

3. I haven’t seen a plane with an octagonal body, try making it more rounded and taper it down towards the back (start the taper right behind the cockpit) like the real A6m

4. Wing shape is fucked, the leading edge of the a6m wing has a very very slight angle, the trailing edge doesn’t have a defined angle either, it shouldn’t have such a steep angle with the delta wing panels, try angle locking if you can. The wings are also *slightly* tilted up irl, I would try angle locking it if you can, it’s not super obvious so you don’t rlly need it if you don’t want

5. Wtf the the random wing panel behind the cockpit

6. The rear horizontal stabilizers on the a6m are positioned slightly in front of the vertical ones, the vertical stabilizer also has a noticeable curve at the top, not a flat edge,

Honest review coming up

Pretty obvious ur new to the game

Rocket spam in the back

Half the rockets aren’t painted

Paint looks horrendous

Your pilot seat is OUTSIDE the cockpit

You are relying purely on propellers to turn the plane and it looks like shit

Honestly all I can say is play the game more, look at others builds, learn what to do and what not to do.

Don’t post your beginner builds in creations and expect upvotes, the shit that actually gets upvoted in there takes hours or days to create and months to years of experience

Most importantly crying about negative feedback and arguing is only gonna make u look like an unde and/or clown

creations-chat 2021-12-11 19:04:49 Do keep in mind the f4 is nearly 50 years older than the f35, also the design of the f4 might not have allowed for sideways doors

creations-chat 2021-12-18 18:46:45 Make them actual towers instead of some bricks, 3 thousand people lost their lives and u spend maybe half an hour making 2 rushed towers with near 0 detail to depict the tragedy for some upvotes on a mf Roblox game. I try to be nice but ur pathetic, capitalizing on the lost lives of others just for some green fucking arrows

AND THERES A FUCKING PLANE

even if it’s not urs, you couldn’t take the time out of your day to get a different picture? Especially with this sensitive of a topic, how low can you get.
creations-chat 2021-12-18 18:50:06 Yes we are because this is a fucking memorial, you need to take ur time building this, you cant rush this shit, it not just a. Bad build ur being disrespectful to the thousands of people who died and their families. 

Put in the hours or just delete that

The picture with the plane needs to be deleted, it makes the whole thing look like its fucking mocking the accident
creations-chat 2021-12-18 18:54:09 It’s obvious you didnt put much effort into that since you said it urself ur too lazy to put fucking windows on the thing, memorials shouldn’t be rushed because its purpose is to honor those who died. You decided to fucking take a tragic event and try to get some upvotes, do you not see how this is just fucking morally wrong? Ive never been this mad at a build or its builder but this is fucking pushing it.
creations-chat 2021-12-18 18:56:56 I may have gone slightly overboard with “fucking”, either way im not done
creations-chat 2021-12-18 19:09:59 What part is “too much” i called them out for their mistake and told them how they could avoid it by not tryna farm upvotes with a memorial and just posting it in <#384021699466756107> or <#497142796961054721>
creations-chat 2021-12-18 19:21:13 So 1st you say its not a plane and now you say it is?

creations-chat 2021-12-23 17:29:32 Body is too undetailed and boxy 

part of the wing should tilt up

where the hell are the flaps

back view please

While on the topic of f4, what can i improve on mine, ill send after this dumbass cooldown
creations-chat 2021-12-23 17:38:08 I think a few exposed motor are worth it since the wing tilt is pretty iconic and the propellers look even worse than exposed motors
creations-chat 2021-12-23 18:05:15 yo i have a lego set of this lol

<@!735168963146678474> paint the random grey spots the same color as the hull, color the motors too
creations-chat 2021-12-23 18:10:27 make the orange slightly less "vibrant" give it a weathered look
the wheels (idk what these r called, i dont know shit abt trains) could be more detailed since it looks plain rn
you could probably angle lock a ladder between the lights since theres a vent there
overall just add some depth by adding detail (vents, texture, doors, access panels etc)

creations-chat 2021-12-28 21:14:25 Didnt want to put this text wall in <#384025409945337856> 

My 1st plane that i put effort into was the F8, it sucked so I decided to remake it with a bunch of angle and motorlocking 
Idk if ill finish it so I'm posting this in <#384025409945337856> 
feel free to suggest some changes and give feedback beside "exposed motorlock"
canopy and gear both work
has gun "muzzle flash" effects
planning to add frames to the canopy, add interior, fix the wings (better flaps n stuff), add better armament, add better gear doors, add custom afterburner
Ill update if I ever get around to adding those changes
creations-chat 2021-12-28 21:18:13 one of the things im planning on adding, dunno if ill do this 1 bcuz of the way its motorlocked
creations-chat 2021-12-28 21:26:24 im pretty sure it did once, not sure if it was the f8 tho ill check

found a vid of the A6 sucking a pilot into an intake, he survived tho
creations-chat 2021-12-29 14:32:24 my f8 relies on a single tower, it is a 4 wide plane tho

what did u mean?

i was gonna move the ripple behind the engine, rn it does look like a fucking boat wave
creations-chat 2021-12-31 18:35:30 I can probably hide it, im removing the gear since I don’t need it for the model
creations-chat 2021-12-31 18:41:12 The f8 has a different nose than the a7, I think it’s fine rn

Wings definitely need a fix

Should i shrink the cockpit or raise the spine?

Could u elaborate on “wider” ? Do u mean like make it a half block or change the shape

Where would u put the rockets? F8 has external hard points on the fuselage (image)

Ty for the feedback
creations-chat 2021-12-31 18:48:08 <@456226577798135808>

Tail should be shorter and wider

Wings are 2 straight angles when folded out, not a curve
creations-chat 2021-12-31 19:00:59 bro this was my 1st custom 💀 

the motorlock bomb would unlock everytime i launched rockets since i forgor to turn off powered, no intakes, no visible form of thrust, the whole damn wing turned to roll my plane and it still rolled like an a380
creations-chat 2021-12-31 20:06:35 moved the wings forward and made the angle consistent, it feels too far front tho, should i move it slightly back?
creations-chat 2021-12-31 20:09:25 alr, gonna work on angling the spine and hide the lock

1. Lack of armor plates
2. Lack of detail
3. Barrel is a bit long
4. Lack of armor plates
5. The 4 cylinders aren’t angled too much, they mostly face the front instead of having the 4th cylinder face the side (dunno how to explain this 1 well)
6. missing antenna/antenna should be longer on your tank
7. “Lines” on the barrel

8. Add some color diversity (ik I didnt circle this 1), use multiple very close shades of green if possible, recolor the mg up top and some of the antenna
creations-chat 2022-01-01 17:25:05 I think an easy way for detail/armor plating is just to put some trails as separation between plates, overall a solid build but could be improved upon

creations-chat 2022-01-13 20:20:59 <@456226577798135808> I looked at the pic of the back and interior and thought “oh that’s nice, finally a decent Hercules. Then I saw the front and what the fuck
creations-chat 2022-01-13 20:29:36 Green is urs, red is irl
Missing window frames, window incorrect shape, missing half the windows, engines are bigger and mounted **below** the wing, ur propellors are fucking tiny use motors and custom props, should be more space between the top of the windshields and the top of the plane, overall the entire front needs a redesign, and having a bunch of text with switches doesn’t look good, your cockpit needs shape, slanted control panels, control stick, buttons, etc

Yes ik the picture is an ac-130 but it’s basically just a c-130 with a shit load of big guns on 1 side

**why is there 2 gallons of fuel INSIDE the cargo bay to fuel a 4 engine, 155000 pound cargo aircraft**

creations-chat 2022-01-14 13:25:21 The iron cross is fine, the funny windmill isn’t

Yea I see it, i doubt it was intentional tho
creations-chat 2022-01-14 13:59:41 Doesn’t look like grass, I would change the texture and darken it to contrast the tank a bit
creations-chat 2022-01-14 15:02:08 I’ll give feedback later, I’m in a class rn
creations-chat 2022-01-14 16:20:11 1. Paint the wheels/sprockets black
2. Add some more color variation, i dont mean shades of green i mean like grey, black, etc
3. The grass was cool (a weathered/slightly beat up jungle version would be a nice break from all the plastic tanks in <#384025409945337856> )
4. If you do the weathered look add some rust texture
5. The front middle of the tank looks empty

Overall the thing that needs the most attention is color variation, she shades of green are nice its just that 99% of the tank is green
creations-chat 2022-01-14 16:25:19 Ig ill start on a tank/armored car once i get home, maybe test out the bomb net idea and add some final touches on my boat
events-chat 2022-01-14 16:26:21 Oh god
events-chat 2022-01-14 16:26:40 I feel like a 3 wide boat wasnt smart after scrolling through <#917397949938548736> lmao
creations-chat 2022-01-14 16:36:26 1. The wheels/sprockets could use mode detailing instead of just some cylinders 
2. Tracks should be black/grey shades
3. Paint those inner blocks next to the light the same color as the sides so  it blends in
events-chat 2022-01-14 16:46:13 Ask tinon or rbk to submit for u
creations-chat 2022-01-14 16:56:06 A spanish maus
creations-chat 2022-01-14 17:01:07 It’s all just painting wdym space?

1. Make those the same color
2. Change those to black or grey imo, the front has a ton of green and needs some contrast
3. Tracks and sprockets should be black
4. Barrel should be a more consistent color/what are the lines (trails) around it?

We finally have a good tank in the works, there’s some stuff to be improved but it has huge potential
creations-chat 2022-01-14 17:05:34 Tbh a few text 1x1 with some emojis or text would be enough, it doesn’t have to hyperdetailed/motorlocked
creations-chat 2022-01-14 17:08:59 Ah alr, 

the actual structure of ur tank is amazing, i said this a ton before but just color variation lol

Same with that l3 in creations rn
Add some grey shading/texture, the structure is pretty good
creations-chat 2022-01-14 17:12:47 Might be a copy but to be fair the maus is a pretty simple shape and there’s not much variation to it

creations-chat 2022-01-15 02:09:53 Also you got hella lazy with this, its completely the wrong shape and it’s too short because the body is too short

<@!701949629708632096> yea ill criticize the paper wings on this 1 but on an actual crusader making the wings thicker is decently hard because its angled and the tip folds up since its a carrier plane

creations-chat 2022-01-18 14:04:35 Magnets or anchoring one half, then using engines to maneuver it together and anchor, use interlacing blocks with dis connectors or something similar on the edges to align them perfectly

creations-chat 2022-01-18 14:12:09 Yep, but I think it would make it a lot better and let u put planes on it
creations-chat 2022-01-18 14:16:32 I highly doubt, carriers are overbuilt so you need to put in a ton of effort for a good carrier since the standards are so high, plus 3 fold is the average
creations-chat 2022-01-18 14:22:07 I can try to help once I get home, or I can try building the back, but I won’t have my computer for another 8 hours so…

To answer the question, I would make a new save slot for it in case you ever decide to change your mind, then start deleting stuff too close/you don’t need, use your old carrier as reference to rebuild certain parts

creations-chat 2022-01-20 22:00:35 Lmao it’s called sarcasm

Having no motorlock isn’t a flex, it’s a sign that you don’t know how to/aren’t willing to spend time doing it
creations-chat 2022-01-20 22:43:52 Is a **sign**, I didn’t say that having no motorlock = bad
creations-chat 2022-01-21 16:13:23 Idk, I tried making something similar to that for my jet but I couldn’t get the trees and terrain right
creations-chat 2022-01-21 16:15:50 Yea the road is a bit too low and wide for such a smal tank, if it was the size of the king tiger in hog then the road would be fine

<@!652925710976942100> use piston lock for the lights to make them appear thin
creations-chat 2022-01-21 16:27:05 Yea but the main focus of the build is the tank, having such a deep road and small tank kinda draws the attention away and makes it look disproportionate, raise the road by half a block and make the trees not look like an enlarged rpg
creations-chat 2022-01-21 16:31:49 Making some areas deeper could work, just try to raise the tank to be the center of attention

Bruh no way you’ve been playing for 2 years without angle lock

Angle locks can wait, motor locking is a key part of pc detailing tho

events-chat 2022-01-30 18:17:55 <@!466793357318815744> would bombers be able to fold wings and stuff outside the plot? Being slow and unable to evade makes a pretty easy target so larger wing/body area would be nice

events-chat 2022-02-08 14:00:19 Make it like wt
events-chat 2022-02-08 14:01:59 If you had enough people space climbing with those 6 engines and just kamikazing the carrier then it might be a really easy cheap way to win
events-chat 2022-02-08 14:02:54 If we both get in then maybe
events-chat 2022-02-08 14:03:34 How many submissions are we allowed to make? I might use the biplane since rockets are far more reliable and less likely to blow up in ur face
events-chat 2022-02-08 14:03:53 Also the maneuverability is stupidly good
events-chat 2022-02-08 14:04:15 You can literally cober in the biplane with no mods
events-chat 2022-02-08 14:05:01 Are we allowed to use different plane for attack/defense?
events-chat 2022-02-08 14:06:41 If it’s gonna be like each team gets one attack and one defense round then the bomber is probably the worst choice you can possibly make
events-chat 2022-02-08 14:07:14 Sure you *might* be able to be some help in the attack round but ur gonna be fukin useless in the defense round
events-chat 2022-02-08 14:07:53 The bomber needs serious buff or it’s literally just gonna be a meme
events-chat 2022-02-08 14:08:28 You get one chance to land your bomb on the attack round and you can’t do jack shit on defense round
events-chat 2022-02-08 14:09:13 Honestly the Tin can can probably do 2-3x the damage  that the bomber can do
events-chat 2022-02-08 14:09:30 You gotta hope for some dumbasses on the enemy team then
events-chat 2022-02-08 14:10:03 How many people are on a team?
events-chat 2022-02-08 14:10:44 It’s slow as shit and can’t pitch to save its life
events-chat 2022-02-08 14:11:00 Imo the biplane or tin can are the best

They didn’t specify what you put on the turret

Correction they didn’t specify how many guns on the turret
events-chat 2022-02-08 14:12:49 Biplane is best choice to me, it’s more powerful than the doof, more guns than tincan so it’s a better defender, might be a bit lacking on offensive but you sure as hell won’t get shot down, we don’t even need to talk about the bomber
events-chat 2022-02-08 14:13:59 Yea
events-chat 2022-02-08 14:15:16 Either needs a nerf or the bomber needs serious help
events-chat 2022-02-08 14:20:37 Yea, best tactic with the bomber is to distract the enemy so your team can get some runs and kamikaze when you know ur going down
events-chat 2022-02-08 14:24:48 I would just space climb then dive for it
events-chat 2022-02-08 14:57:18 Sbd dauntless lma
events-chat 2022-02-08 14:57:50 That’s the point of the bomber
events-chat 2022-02-08 14:58:35 Mitchel is 2 engine, imagine a b36, b47 etc attacking a carrier
events-chat 2022-02-08 14:59:27 Literally the point of the planes is to be agile and a fucking nightmare to hit
events-chat 2022-02-08 14:59:49 The bomber is the opposite
events-chat 2022-02-08 15:00:06 Use picture lma

Also there’s a helium block behind the pilot seat
events-chat 2022-02-08 15:01:14 Imma wait for any changes before I submit, if nothing changes I’m using biplane
events-chat 2022-02-08 15:02:50 Doof is too underpowered as an attacker imo
events-chat 2022-02-08 15:03:39 You need to think which plane will be good for both roles, the only one that really shines in both is the biplane
events-chat 2022-02-08 15:04:03 The tincan is fragile and clunky to fly, shoot the landing gear and it’s fucked

The gun placement in biplane is perfect for tearing apart planes
events-chat 2022-02-08 15:04:36 Especially since they added a third gun
events-chat 2022-02-08 15:04:57 I put it in front of canopy so it’s a triangle fire pattern with a rocket under it
events-chat 2022-02-08 15:05:31 That’s why you don’t use fireworks
events-chat 2022-02-08 15:06:03 Plus rocket can work on carrier
events-chat 2022-02-08 15:06:30 Actually if you mount the turret under the bomber it might work as a distraction while you beam the carrier under you
events-chat 2022-02-08 15:06:55 Sorta
events-chat 2022-02-08 15:07:29 Ez
events-chat 2022-02-08 15:08:06 Plus you have 2nd layer of wing

events-chat 2022-02-08 18:00:17 Torpedos are weak bombs, technically you can drop the bomb in water and call it a torpedo and you have 2x the firepower with bomb
events-chat 2022-02-08 18:00:36 Rockets r still the best tho

events-chat 2022-02-22 14:01:45 Basically the yousuf of this event since you get 2 tries to kill a massive enemy

events-chat 2022-02-22 17:42:13 1 piece pops off and ur balance go bye bye
creations-chat 2022-02-22 17:59:26 Lo whitename
creations-chat 2022-02-22 20:33:24 That’s the entire fucking point of this channel, we aren’t gonna sugar coat shit and go “ohh wow ur soo good omg but maybe possibly ignore me you don’t have to listen but these parts maybe kinda aren’t amazing and flawless. There’s no point to that elementary bullshit, some people can’t take actual feedback and their massive ego automatically validates everything they do and makes excuses for why parts of their build is shit (“oh I can’t fit it, oh I’m still new”), just troubleshoot and fix the problem instead of being a bitch about it

<@!401530469952389130> 

to summarize this horrible argument and person
1. chunktheory is a narcissist 
2. he can’t take feedback
3. fragile ego
4. people who try to give him feedback apparently get accused of bias against him (he literally takes everything personally)
5. literally looks for any possible way to start an argument

(Credit to fleet lol)
creations-chat 2022-02-22 20:37:03 Not rlly, you should see arguments about 9/11 related builds
events-chat 2022-02-22 21:41:29 Either way it’s still gonna be by far the worst out of the 3 unless it’s a motorlocked cluster bomb which utilizes at least 50 tnt

Reason? You get one shot and after that ur only purpose is a meat shield
events-chat 2022-02-22 21:43:54 Doesnt change the fact that you have 1 shot of a missile in a game with shit collision physics
creations-chat 2022-02-22 21:46:59 1. Cool

2. Never gave feedback, never even talked to you

3. Did i say you did?

4. Havent pinged you u til now

5. How would u know my age again? Don’t remember telling you
events-chat 2022-02-22 21:48:09 Doesnt change the fact that you get 1 shot while every other class has infinite, same problem as Yousuf from carrier event before they buffed it with downwards rockets
events-chat 2022-02-22 21:48:37 Or choose a different class and macro rockets
events-chat 2022-02-22 21:49:07 That what I mean by macro lo

creations-chat 2022-02-23 21:20:39 About 1.5 blocks lol

Good luck fitting tracks, body, and the tall part w gun

I might make one as a side project
events-chat 2022-02-23 21:28:50 This is the one event I would attempt to make the ships as large as possible since the max speed is so slow and the ships armament is pathetic, being massive and able to tank shots might be better than being harder to hit since ships get turrets
events-chat 2022-02-23 21:36:26 I guess a smaller ship could work especially against the torpedo airship since it’s gonna be near impossible to hit it with torpedos unless it’s a cluster bomb
events-chat 2022-02-23 23:05:37 I think the torpedo is more of a risky choice, they didn’t specify how much tnt could be used and never forbade motorlock, if you know the missile design I was testing recently it just might work

I’ll hop in vip 1 later

Make the colors closer and less vibrant
creations-chat 2022-03-04 20:25:36 Its ass

Is it for pvp? I’m guessing yes since you made it explosive

First of all I personally prefer slider tanks since it eliminates wheels as a weak spot

Secondly, you need a turret, not just personal preference, a pvp build is shit without a turret
creations-chat 2022-03-04 20:32:00 From that picture it’s absolute crap, I could kill that before your rocket even passes your windshield 

No turret
No armor, can be instantly killed with a singular firework
Frontal wing panels mess with turning, made even worse since your only way to aim is with turning
Wheels are an easy target
220 sps isnt much

creations-chat 2022-03-05 19:38:55 Dunno what to do about engines, it’s either 1x1, 2x2, or 3x3

Wdym by fix spine? Should I taper it down closer to nose?

I can switch between glitched and wasd, I didn’t use motor 2 for this one

For pvp, was asking if there’s an optimal rocket or gun placement, I spread the rockets out a bit for a higher chance of hitting something

Next thing I’m gonna do is try to rig a few cluster bombs on it
creations-chat 2022-03-05 19:42:01 Worth slapping fireworks inside or no?

creations-chat 2022-03-09 23:27:49 Also the general negativity in this chat generally comes from builds with builders that aren’t willing to improve/post 5 fucking times and showed 0 progress and flood <#384025409945337856> with crappy builds. Seeing a builder with a genuine passion to improve and take feedback is a rare but good sight to see, always try to give actual feedback to these people

creations-chat 2022-03-12 20:18:08 Bad wording sry, I mean some detailing (text on signs, antenna) should be bit darker to add contrast and bring out shape, basically make it look like you didnt paint bucket, maybe text or sparklers in the wheels but that might take a while

<@456226577798135808> cope

I’m nowhere near ppl like double, cramming that much detail in a tiny build is just insane to me, I tried a roscale firebird and still can’t figure out to do the grille lol
creations-chat 2022-03-12 20:22:21 I have no interest in making one of the most overbuilt helis in this game

<@456226577798135808> point made, sometimes I would give up some realism for better aesthetics tho, real life ain’t flawless
creations-chat 2022-03-12 20:24:29 I know damn well I could if it wasn’t roscale, roscale Huey is fuckin tiny

<@456226577798135808> you do better than this before you start saying I can’t build

Fixed the shitty painting on the belly, ignore that one blue block lol
creations-chat 2022-03-12 20:27:04 Urs isn’t even close to roscale dumbfuck, you build your best roscale Huey and I promise I’ll do one better

<@!401530469952389130> with working doors and shit, idk where to hide the locks in a 3x4x3 box lol

<@!297120728342331392> I can see 3.5 body and 3 nose but 4 is really pushing it
creations-chat 2022-03-12 20:29:17 But yea, to answer your question could use better coloring and detail on wheel, still got my upvote tho

<@!401530469952389130> wait where?

I saw a good Huey in vip1 once, forgor if it was roscale tho
creations-chat 2022-03-12 20:32:31 Urs is 4 wide dumbass, it’s far too big, huey irl doesn’t have enough room for an average adult to stand up straight

creations-chat 2022-03-12 20:35:04 2nd one looks too big for roscale

events-chat 2022-03-24 12:20:17 Can you not do classes for this battle? Just do a set of general limitations
events-chat 2022-03-24 12:20:36 The classes are super limiting and generally make building stuff less fun
events-chat 2022-03-24 12:21:02 Also yea let us use big nuclear subs n shit lol
events-chat 2022-03-24 12:54:34 So far the only event where I kinda liked the classes was the carrier

creations-chat 2022-03-24 13:28:51 You paint as you build dumbass

Waiting to the end to paint is a mistake
events-chat 2022-03-24 13:34:56 WOOO
creations-chat 2022-03-24 13:36:05 That way you can see if there’s any weird clipping and fix it before you finish the whole damn thing and it becomes a pain in the ass to edit a single block

<@!588596347272167456> or read this and realize your mistake

Bruh have you heard of trying to make a nice livery? Can’t just paint it the same color

Kinda found out the hard way with my f-10
creations-chat 2022-03-24 13:39:24 Then at least you realize you don’t like the paint before you paint the whole thing, then you only have to repaint one part

see if you can have the body sit a bit lower and bend the legs a bit since that 90 degree angle looks unnatural 

<@!918581321004089364> add the box in front of the tower, add windows/the gaps in the tower, make the panel material wood and paint it so it doesn't look like plastic, add detail like the bolts, wiring, and pipes

your pc performance doesn't matter and its not an excuse to have a shitty build, fps doesn't mean shit when ur taking a screenshot

creations-chat 2022-04-05 13:11:55 Not even fucking close
The front shape is completely wrong

I don’t think the p-47 had fucking slits in the wings

P-47 didn’t have wings that looked like fucking paper

The taper to the back is way too steep

Whole body shape is wrong

Should be more curved instead of an angled brick

I don’t give a flying fuck if you spent 4 years measuring shit, I would rather upvote something that actually looks good

The p-47 is a pretty nice looking plane and you saying its “the most accurate possible” is just plain bullshit

Redo it, I don’t even wanna mention the colors since it’s been brought up 4 times and you clearly don’t care about actual feedback

Cry bout it whitename

Also the shape is just so wrong, not even a shitty pc can justify that

Instead of accepting feedback and improving you just keep making excuses for your skill issue

Just build a dedicated pvp plane and quit tryna merge the 2, it’s only gonna make it look ass and be shit at pvp

creations-chat 2022-04-06 20:54:02 That general frame would be abysmal for pvp, an optimal pvp tank had minimal weak points to shoot at, the entire lower half of your tank is a weak point

I would say at least 700-1000 speed if you really want to use it since shooting out a leg basically ruins your tank
creations-chat 2022-04-06 20:59:06 Even in public it might be an issue, the tank I built has wheels purely for decor and bait to keep internals safe, I also added a lower camera frame to if the wheels get shot out I still “float” on them

creations-chat 2022-04-09 18:12:09 ???

First you weren’t even the one who posted it

Second, it doesn’t only look bad, it looks like the average shitty public server build
creations-chat 2022-04-09 18:15:53 Can’t really tell, there’s not enough contrast for me to see much lol
creations-chat 2022-04-09 18:48:48 It could be so much better

1. Colors are ass
2. Missing the ropes and stuff hanging from the cranes or wtvr those are
3. Ur missing a whole fucking crane
4. No detailing on the sides
5. It’s missing some major curves along the hull and top(outlined in red)
6. Ur bridge looks so fucking abysmal
7. No rudder and do we even need to talk about that propellor replacement
8. It can benefit greatly from motorlock since it looks like a sharp brick rn 
9. You didn’t even try to put windows
10. Missing anchors

TLDR shape is so fucking wrong, there’s 0 detail, you have such a stuck up attitude about a bad build

I’m expecting his next message to be some unde shit like “show me one of your builds”

<@592619320421384232> pretty cool ngl, the wall could use more decor like paintings but that might be somewhat painful to motorlock

creations-chat 2022-05-19 02:50:42 oh yea im making a 3rd pvp plane

the mig 25 was the first, didnt have supermaneuverability or m2m, adding bombs/any other payload besides rockets was a pain in the ass, i only use it for the 150 locked bombs i strapped to it since im too lazy to slap those on any other jet

The f-10 v1 is self explanatory, stupidly unstable, overmaneuverable to the point where you cant even hit a shot, didnt have m2m

F-10 V2 was pretty good, payload is easily swappable, pretty good maneuverability but a bit overkill, I modded it to have m2m but it wasnt designed for m2m so it doesnt work well over 600 sps
