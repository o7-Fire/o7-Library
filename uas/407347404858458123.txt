creations-chat 2020-10-11 15:35:18 A bridge and funnel as well as 2 torpedoes
creations-chat 2020-10-11 15:36:59 Those depth charges
I see them alot how useful actually are they?
creations-chat 2020-10-11 15:38:18 I might include them in my PT boat though it already has depth charge trays on the back they just don't sink
creations-chat 2020-10-11 15:41:20 Not really
Patrol boats can get pretty big
creations-chat 2020-10-11 15:41:53 Barrel bombs?
creations-chat 2020-10-11 15:43:54 ^
creations-chat 2020-10-11 15:47:37 I'm (slowly) designing a fully working I 400 with 8 reloading torpedoe tubes and 3 aircraft which are not only able to launch but are able to come back too and be re fastened into the hanger
I have the Submarine haul I'm going to be using from an older sub of mine
Making small float planes that's tails and wings fold down is quite troubling though
creations-chat 2020-10-11 15:50:15 I'm bad at small things (that don't use motor lock)
creations-chat 2020-10-11 15:50:59 I don't get how the ranks work
creations-chat 2020-10-11 15:52:30 <:MichiFlustered:735209099310137365>
creations-chat 2020-10-11 15:55:49 Wait.. do WIP's include assets? Because my Gollioth isn't really a build by itself it's meant to be strapped to the back of my other tanks and stuff
creations-chat 2020-10-11 15:56:43 Ight
creations-chat 2020-10-11 16:04:28 That engine is so sexy
creations-chat 2020-10-11 16:05:19 *I just avoid coloring by using a dark color and pink*
creations-chat 2020-10-11 17:53:03 a-10s are so simple and feel so much much older I love them
creations-chat 2020-10-11 17:57:44 I like the current colors they are abonoxously bright
creations-chat 2020-10-11 18:13:52 I need an algorithm that hits a key for every beat of music 
So that I can make my half track's engine flare every beat
creations-chat 2020-10-11 18:20:05 <@456226577798135808> that's fair but all my builds are dark and so militerized
But something always seems so whimsical about old ww1 Bi planes
I like making them brighter
creations-chat 2020-10-11 18:23:56 my half track plays clint eastwood
creations-chat 2020-10-11 19:00:45 We might start working on another small tank.
Any ideas? We're thinking something amphibious.
creations-chat 2020-10-11 19:04:05 Also we feel like adopt me may be forced to undo the update
Roblox would never take it down it's too much of a cash cow
But we haven't been able to use chat since yesterday so-
creations-chat 2020-10-11 19:04:38 Yeah
creations-chat 2020-10-11 19:07:30 We don't understand how conveyor tanks turn
Because they can't turn like tanks..
creations-chat 2020-10-11 19:09:59 We have only ever made wheel tanks..

No they can't because if you stop turning one set of conveyors it just keeps going forward half speed
creations-chat 2020-10-11 19:12:10 I was going too quickly build a "This us a rick roll" and add it on my plot and then post it and I thought if I did that the mods would get mad so-
creations-chat 2020-10-11 19:12:54 How do the ranks work? Can someone explain?

creations-chat 2020-10-11 20:16:44 It's RGB.. I don't understand why it's RGB but it's RGB
creations-chat 2020-10-11 20:20:34 Yeah oreoning is right.. this community is pretty vile
But most vehicle or military aircraft centered things like plane crazy I noticed tend to attract these same types of people... So yeah..
creations-chat 2020-10-11 20:21:45 Yeah
creations-chat 2020-10-11 20:24:05 Like I'm not building massive things because I don't like playing them I only build light tanks because I find heavier things boring
I don't build jets because I find them boring not because I can't
But the assumption constantly made is that I am terrible because I don't like making ceirtian things
Or you know people just go "shut up furry" but I think that's just a roblox thing
creations-chat 2020-10-11 20:32:39 I'm bitching about the shit I am given for being a furry
Not really about the downvotes.. 
Lol

creations-chat 2020-10-11 20:44:00 Danm
That's sad
It's the exact kind of beautiful abomination that I'd expect to be built
Truely a marvel
creations-chat 2020-10-11 20:59:43 Alright sweet so it does exist
creations-chat 2020-10-11 21:00:37 I was just wondering it's one of my favorite planes because it's fucking wack
But I don't want to build it because it's 90% wing and I hate building normal plane wings let alone 9 of them
creations-chat 2020-10-11 21:01:23 > thats a bi-bi-bi-bi-bi-bi-plane
<@626449107577471012>

Nine wings

Our freind laughed this off understanding but he came over and started bitching at us for throwing shit
I couldn't explain because my tics were acting up
Him yelling made it worse
And any time our freind tried he'd go " don't get involved"

So yeah not nice guy

creations-chat 2020-10-12 01:58:34 Uh.. why are you using a slow ass bomber against shredder bugs? That's not very smart
creations-chat 2020-10-12 02:00:14 Why? Why are you trying too when your in a game of shredder bugs
You don't need a Heavy bomber in that case
You need a fighter to take care of the bugs
Then if there are things to bomb you use a bomber
creations-chat 2020-10-12 02:02:29 Motherfu- then why are you using it in a game of shredders
Destroy the shredders
The enemy is bringing a shredder to s table and your getting mad because you don't want to use the thing that destroys them
Like th
creations-chat 2020-10-12 10:34:34 Why do people seem to downvote any type of smaller build if it doesn't use motor lock?
creations-chat 2020-10-12 10:37:39 Not really..? Alot of them are pretty high effort especially things like mini hovercraft bikes cars subs because you have to get balancing right..
Also alot of them are meant to be built as part of different things
creations-chat 2020-10-12 10:40:19 Alright
What about this?
This got downvoted dispite it being pretty detailed and it's main goal being small and light weight at 30 blocks so it can be carried by tanks
creations-chat 2020-10-12 10:42:54 The Gollioth beeped had a speaker and explosives as well as could be trathered to the tank by rope the form the cable it actually had (although less efficient

creations-chat 2020-10-12 16:03:33 
creations-chat 2020-10-12 17:24:13 It's scale is to smal for e to use tracks and I wanted it to be faster so I used wheels
creations-chat 2020-10-12 17:25:18 also I play on a fucking calculator 
so the lag tracks make isn't ideal..
creations-chat 2020-10-12 17:52:47 what else should I add to the armed half track?
creations-chat 2020-10-12 17:55:02 I tried adding better looking tracks they just reduced it's current high speed by alot
creations-chat 2020-10-12 17:56:44 it functions as a half track with tractor tank steering in the back and truck steering in the front..  that's why i contune calling it a half track even though I took the better looking treads I had on it off
creations-chat 2020-10-12 17:58:16 2 by 2
creations-chat 2020-10-12 18:02:57 <@!359613171495075842>  they are right next to each other with 6 of them (no motor lock in the base for extra wheels)
creations-chat 2020-10-12 18:14:34 I'm bored
creations-chat 2020-10-12 18:17:02 I'll try to ree add the tracks to my half track while maintaining it's high speed...
creations-chat 2020-10-12 18:31:18 Any other **weopons** I should add to my half track
creations-chat 2020-10-12 18:34:40 I was thinking about adding a larger cal turret on top.. but the beauty of the current design is it's kinda more supportive then anything.. I can easily pass as unarmed and thus not a threat when entering a tank battle until I decide to pick an enemy.. or I can use my mines and completely stay out of the fight
A big gun would make it a bigger target
And I can only outrun so many rockets

The experienced players with actually dangerous tanks leave you alone because your unarmed
You hide behind them when the noobs come to destroy you 
Then Just when your outmatched by the rocket spam you deploy your own rockets
Having spent so much time along side the experienced tanks they won't attack you even though it's clear you are armed and the noobs have another threat to deal with

Please stop so this channel becomes useable for what it's meant too be used for
creations-chat 2020-10-13 12:57:25 I think he kinda knew it was going to get downvoted
creations-chat 2020-10-13 12:59:27 *mwahaha*
creations-chat 2020-10-13 13:01:14 I'm going to go back to snuggling my floof
creations-chat 2020-10-13 13:04:29 <@553225222904479744> I really like how low profile that is
creations-chat 2020-10-13 13:06:22 I mean it's intresting..
creations-chat 2020-10-13 13:07:53 It's a good hand dryer
creations-chat 2020-10-13 13:08:24 Indeed
creations-chat 2020-10-13 13:08:58 It's a fenta wing
creations-chat 2020-10-13 13:25:20 *yours will probably work better then the actual one
Fucking thing jammed every 5 minutes*
creations-chat 2020-10-13 13:25:55 Yeah it was super cool
creations-chat 2020-10-13 13:26:25 And scary looking
But a terrible machine gun

Rhino is fucking bae
creations-chat 2020-10-13 13:27:11 I love the rhino
I was the weird girl who was into nerf and art
creations-chat 2020-10-13 13:32:55 Anyone ever have the double barrel shotgun? I fucking loved that thing it was my go too
creations-chat 2020-10-13 13:33:35 That and my orange sniper
I don't even remember what it was called but it was orange had a scope and shot down a block and a half
creations-chat 2020-10-13 13:35:47 The rihno was too big for a go too
I keep that at my base

Sniper for main
I don't remember what the sniper was but it shot farrr

Modulus is a good side arm because you can use it for anything and it's reliable

And the zombie strike or elite 2 shot pistol is yes
creations-chat 2020-10-13 13:36:28 If your carrying the vulcan or rihno into battle you be looking like gorge from halo reach
creations-chat 2020-10-13 13:36:54 I don't have the build for that no thanks
I'ma stick to carrying around a sniper and shotty
creations-chat 2020-10-13 13:39:29 I found my sniper
It's called the raptor strike
creations-chat 2020-10-13 13:40:21 Though I think mine was a n earlier version of it? It had an actual scope and the berral could be added too.
creations-chat 2020-10-13 13:41:53 This fucking thing was best side arm
creations-chat 2020-10-13 13:42:15 Take your zombie strike pistol and shoulve it up your ass this was basically a blunderbuss
creations-chat 2020-10-13 13:51:04 I mean it was for all the newer ones
It would eat the old tag team darts tho
creations-chat 2020-10-13 13:51:20 But nobody uses those
Those
Those were bad
creations-chat 2020-10-13 13:52:43 I actually can't think of any good tag team guns except for the micro pistol
And I think they remade that as elite so.. yeah fuck tag team
creations-chat 2020-10-13 13:53:20 Oh wait
The judge was scary
I don't remember if it was good but it was scary looking
creations-chat 2020-10-13 14:25:19 Early wip of my blimp's gene
creations-chat 2020-10-13 14:35:56 Anyone ever see the movie event horizon?
creations-chat 2020-10-13 14:36:21 I wanna build the ship from it
Just because it looks awesome
creations-chat 2020-10-13 15:40:16 Flappy boi
creations-chat 2020-10-13 15:40:53 Question
Do blimps fly forward and turn with a rudder like a plane or can they turn while stationary?
creations-chat 2020-10-13 15:41:29 I know
creations-chat 2020-10-13 15:41:45 But I was wondering if they used there engines to turn during like
Docking and shit
creations-chat 2020-10-13 15:42:45 They turned upwards
But how do you dock something that needs to be moving forward to turn??
creations-chat 2020-10-13 15:43:48 Like
How would they have orentated it when landing it  if it's using only a rudder to turn them
creations-chat 2020-10-13 15:44:45 Shit wait so I have to- ohh
Okay got it
creations-chat 2020-10-13 15:45:10 Basiclly tank steering but in the form of blimps engines
creations-chat 2020-10-13 15:45:50 That's going to be a pain... I think I can pull it off though
creations-chat 2020-10-13 15:46:30 I know
creations-chat 2020-10-13 15:47:04 I'm not going to be using a tower my blimp is too small
creations-chat 2020-10-13 16:01:38 should I arm my smoll boat?
creations-chat 2020-10-13 16:06:11 should I arm my smoll boat?
creations-chat 2020-10-13 16:14:38 Wow I really didn't expect that to get so many upvotes because it had my usual lazy paint job..
creations-chat 2020-10-13 16:16:21 Blimp
creations-chat 2020-10-13 17:03:44 What type of arms do I put on a blimp? Like how do you pvp with them. I'm thinking I would treat it like a gunship right? A bomber with alot of AA and guns to attack ground targets
But idk
creations-chat 2020-10-13 17:05:33 Well it carries bombs and is slow
That's pretty similar to a gunship..
Idk what do I arm it with
How do you pvp with a blimp in PC
creations-chat 2020-10-13 17:06:53 Not even like
Just bombing? My bi plane has a max speed of 84 and it's one of my most effective creations
creations-chat 2020-10-13 17:07:21 It's basically a heavy bomber mixed with a gunship
creations-chat 2020-10-13 17:08:23 It has a boost that can go over 3000 speed
But it's main bombing speed is 84 and it spends most of it's time like that
It's main use is heavy carpet bombing and then being used as a gunship
creations-chat 2020-10-13 17:09:13 That's why It doesn't
creations-chat 2020-10-13 17:10:18 That boost is a very very last resort
It's max speed is 80 something
It slowly buzzes over spawn carpet bombs dumps fireworks and rockets 
That's what it does
I'm wondering if the blimp should be similar or..?
creations-chat 2020-10-13 17:15:58 
creations-chat 2020-10-13 17:16:12 this slow ass thing destroys in pvp
creations-chat 2020-10-13 17:17:06 who?.. what's this chat being flooded with now?..
creations-chat 2020-10-13 17:18:31 I let people copy my stuff none of it is really complicated or good enough for me to be too protective over it
creations-chat 2020-10-13 17:43:08 > Imagine NOT going to pvp
<@456226577798135808> 

This tbh^
creations-chat 2020-10-13 17:43:35 I thought we already went through all this -.-
creations-chat 2020-10-13 17:44:43 Uh.. k..
Anyways
creations-chat 2020-10-13 17:45:28 Anchor blocks in blimp yes or no
creations-chat 2020-10-13 17:47:02 Yeah I really thought we were over the whole me being a furry thing
Guess not lol
creations-chat 2020-10-13 17:47:18 <:Upvote:490311647492309004>
creations-chat 2020-10-13 17:49:56 Also for the blimp
Are the 2 wing near the rail alerons or elivators
Because it seems wrong to tilt the whole ass thing up to go up given its a helium balloon on crack it should do that on its own
creations-chat 2020-10-13 17:50:36 And Idk where the hell else alerions would be..
creations-chat 2020-10-13 17:52:52 Lol funne

creations-chat 2020-10-13 23:24:20 Its an early WIP
creations-chat 2020-10-13 23:24:39 I'm still working on the cabin and then will do the rudders and engines
creations-chat 2020-10-13 23:25:18 Diamond Metal 
I do it for big things like ship hauls because I have poor vision and it helps me see the shape better
That will be changed later
creations-chat 2020-10-13 23:26:50 I want to have 2 large billboards with like
Lights that just from the bottom of the board and light it up
Basiclly a road side billboard on the sides of the blimp
creations-chat 2020-10-13 23:27:23 Idk what I would put on them yet..
creations-chat 2020-10-13 23:28:30 Yeah
Like
creations-chat 2020-10-13 23:30:17 Yeah I intended on having a small plane on it
creations-chat 2020-10-13 23:31:16 The blimp is basically my vibe ship
Like it has a bridge a cabin maybe a small sitting area
I want it to remain unarmed.. if I make an armed version I will
creations-chat 2020-10-13 23:32:41 Same I will likely make an armed varient
creations-chat 2020-10-13 23:32:57 But I just want to make a working blimp first
creations-chat 2020-10-14 00:02:22 <@484529511468236802> bro you can't fly that in Detroit the air base is too close and they will shoot your ass down

Guys why in this chat please take it somewhere else this chat is always flooded with stuff like this
creations-chat 2020-10-14 00:20:54 I just don't understand it..
I want to ask for feedback about something but now I have to wait for this to stop...
creations-chat 2020-10-14 00:22:13 <@484529511468236802> why brazil?
creations-chat 2020-10-14 00:23:21 <@265819387498332160> it's really annoying.. like I want to hear 70 people all complaining about a self upvote I just want feedback on this engine
creations-chat 2020-10-14 00:25:22 Yeah
They are doing a good job
creations-chat 2020-10-14 00:26:04 I do think there are a few people who still scream about every self upvote and every troll post that just aren't delt with and I don't understand why..

creations-chat 2020-10-14 01:16:09 rudder and ailerons are not there yet but the tail is getting there..
creations-chat 2020-10-14 01:16:25 
creations-chat 2020-10-14 01:16:50 Ehh.. ok
creations-chat 2020-10-14 01:19:16 how is this?
creations-chat 2020-10-14 01:20:27 I have to fit alot in it.. do I need to make it thinner or shorter?
creations-chat 2020-10-14 01:21:41 A bridge and cabin.. and a few other rooms.. idk
Alright I can make it shorter
creations-chat 2020-10-14 01:23:32 That's true... Actually yeah I could put it up in the body wtf am I doing
creations-chat 2020-10-14 01:25:05 I made the cabin super big like "oh I want all sorts of stuff in it just to chill out"
But there will be space in the envelope to do that
creations-chat 2020-10-14 01:28:20 I mean I'm imagining it dosent actually take that much helium to lift stuff up in the game
creations-chat 2020-10-14 01:29:49 how is this
creations-chat 2020-10-14 01:30:04

creations-chat 2020-10-14 01:56:44 <@683847069890510887> why ew?
creations-chat 2020-10-14 01:57:57 I'm wondering if you have actual feedback or just want to show disgust while not backing that on anything
creations-chat 2020-10-14 02:00:05 Neat
creations-chat 2020-10-14 02:03:32 Rays a oof
creations-chat 2020-10-14 03:06:51 Might use a slow conv engine for take off and landing as it shouldn't tilt the craft at all
creations-chat 2020-10-14 03:09:34 Although the current system is janky as hell.. I don't really know how to fix it so.. it working weirdly is better then it not working at all
creations-chat 2020-10-14 03:13:40 Hm?
creations-chat 2020-10-14 03:14:21 Uh huh..
creations-chat 2020-10-14 03:14:49 Well luckily I was referring to <@491570111787040778>

creations-chat 2020-10-14 13:54:38 <@209005642000760832> why does your tank have 2 motors on each wheel?
creations-chat 2020-10-14 13:57:58 I always just used the one set and then had AD together as reverse with W as forward
And A and D separately to turn
creations-chat 2020-10-14 14:09:44 I'm scared
creations-chat 2020-10-14 14:15:05 Germany: "what if we mount a railway gun to 2 tank chassis"
Me: "that's a really fucking stupid idea y'all are dumb af but here I am building it"
creations-chat 2020-10-14 14:18:24 Thet looks amazing
creations-chat 2020-10-14 14:20:57 <:sipp:741899384815616100>
creations-chat 2020-10-14 14:21:38 It should
creations-chat 2020-10-14 14:21:55 Why?
creations-chat 2020-10-14 14:22:15 Wtf does that mean
creations-chat 2020-10-14 14:25:12 It flies and it's pretty impressive for it's size
I think a small impressive thing is alot harder to make then a large one
creations-chat 2020-10-14 14:26:58 <@685909594932773033> I didn't say that
I said it's harder to make it impressive
creations-chat 2020-10-14 14:27:54 How is that not enough it's literally hall of FAME
creations-chat 2020-10-14 14:30:19 <@685909594932773033> yeah and that's stupid
The van should totally get in it's amused and impressed litteraly everyone
creations-chat 2020-10-14 14:31:39 No we all think it's pretty impressive
And even if it was the former
That should still get it in the hall of fame as it's now a famous build
creations-chat 2020-10-14 16:41:45 <@456226577798135808>  lol a truer statement has never been made
creations-chat 2020-10-14 16:42:04 I wanna make a crop duster
Which one should I make?
creations-chat 2020-10-14 16:43:10 That's not-
creations-chat 2020-10-14 16:44:17 If I wanted to build a military plane it wouldn't be a crop duster
I want to build a slow ass plane
creations-chat 2020-10-14 16:44:33 Which one should I build
creations-chat 2020-10-14 16:45:02 Oh my fucking god shut the actual fuck up about the van
creations-chat 2020-10-14 16:49:56 Technically 3 speeds
Full ahead
Stop
Full reverse
creations-chat 2020-10-14 16:50:12 Yeah I'd use them as a boost
creations-chat 2020-10-14 16:51:29 Some of my planes are only conv engines (mainly because I created a super stable 3 speed design that works well a as main engine and boost)
creations-chat 2020-10-14 16:51:56 Like my Stuka and CA 3
creations-chat 2020-10-14 16:53:01 Flappy bois
creations-chat 2020-10-14 16:53:40 This is one "L" away from getting weird
creations-chat 2020-10-14 16:53:57 Top
creations-chat 2020-10-14 16:55:08 That would only be one laddar
creations-chat 2020-10-14 16:55:34 No
creations-chat 2020-10-14 16:56:03 I wanna make that one german proposal to mount one of there massive rail guns on 2 PZ4 chassis
creations-chat 2020-10-14 16:56:19 Add armor and then roll it out as a tank
creations-chat 2020-10-14 16:57:02 It reminds me of the gorrilaz strange times RV

Which is a thing I made once apon a time
creations-chat 2020-10-14 16:57:39 <@325875263336349696> that's what it was
The gustav cannon on 2 tonk bodies
creations-chat 2020-10-14 16:58:09 Yez
creations-chat 2020-10-14 16:58:30 My favorite chinook
creations-chat 2020-10-14 16:59:41 Anyways
Crop duster
Which one should I do
creations-chat 2020-10-14 17:01:12 "TV pitching is like the isrialian flag
It's nothing without a big star"
creations-chat 2020-10-14 17:02:19 ^
creations-chat 2020-10-14 17:02:45 I'm from weebland
creations-chat 2020-10-14 17:03:06 <:CertifiedMoment:570774089099116548>
creations-chat 2020-10-14 17:04:12 Dis is getting pretty fucked up
creations-chat 2020-10-14 17:04:47 I'ma just... <@195253906333368320> hi yes your chat is bein bad..
creations-chat 2020-10-14 17:10:53 <@335599526414909451> bro mod this shit rather then letting it go on please
creations-chat 2020-10-14 17:14:05 Okay so if this is over
 what type of crop duster should I make?
creations-chat 2020-10-14 17:16:24 Thanks staff for attempting to help this channel not be shit post and drama central.. hopefully it gets better now..
creations-chat 2020-10-14 17:27:28 Which one should I make?
creations-chat 2020-10-14 17:30:17 > neither
<@484529511468236802>  why? They are the 2 most common ones and they both look pretty neat..
creations-chat 2020-10-14 17:48:37 Not one actual answer? This chat is useless
creations-chat 2020-10-14 17:57:43 Tell me about it -.- iv been asking for opinions on which one I should do all day
creations-chat 2020-10-14 18:00:53 The slow mode is needed to keep this chat sane.
Take your drama elsewhere
creations-chat 2020-10-14 18:22:26 > this slowmode is definitely beneficial and i hope its permanent
<@265819387498332160> 
Agreed
creations-chat 2020-10-14 18:27:43 Well see that's what happens when the only conversations you want to have are just screeming about self upvotes or drama rather then actually talking about builds. People who actually want to talk about builds will see this as what it is
A slight inconvenience in exchange for a channel we can actually use now.
creations-chat 2020-10-14 18:47:32 That moment when you take over the sky island in a tank
creations-chat 2020-10-14 18:51:04 <@456226577798135808> same
creations-chat 2020-10-14 18:53:06 It's very helpful
Notice how this chat isn't currently a shit show
creations-chat 2020-10-14 19:56:04 You know you have done right hand your small tank can brrr its way up onto the airport
creations-chat 2020-10-14 19:58:07 That too
creations-chat 2020-10-14 20:00:08 Clown town ^


It makes the chat way more tolerable
creations-chat 2020-10-14 20:06:02 I only really dislike when people downvote for either "Lazy paint" when I just like my builds colored black and pink or for "exposed mechanics" when all my stuff is kinda cyberpunk already and it honestly just adds to the esthetic
creations-chat 2020-10-14 21:03:47 How should I go about doing these bars that stabilize the wings?
creations-chat 2020-10-14 21:07:03 Yeah but I was wondering if there is some other way I should do it or just motors
Because I don't want to use alot of motor lock

What angle would you say those wings are at?
creations-chat 2020-10-14 21:15:34 He's banned from the tank musuam for a very good reason
creations-chat 2020-10-14 21:23:03 Wait isn't it possible to stick angled beams to things with cameras somehow?
If so how does one do that?
creations-chat 2020-10-14 21:27:47 <@484529511468236802> wait so if I angle a set a beam above the wing and angle it to point the right way it will angle correctly?
creations-chat 2020-10-14 22:52:11 The message quality has been significantly decreased seince the cooldown was lowered to 1 minute

Funny how that happens
creations-chat 2020-10-14 22:54:02 2 minutes and the messages people sent were far better then what is currently being sent.
It should stay up at 2 minutes
creations-chat 2020-10-14 22:57:49 I would be okay with 10 minute
This shouldn't really be a general conversation channel
That's what <#384021699466756107>  is for
creations-chat 2020-10-14 23:17:02 Tf you talking about it's super cursed
That thing would flip over
creations-chat 2020-10-14 23:18:44 But they did stop
creations-chat 2020-10-15 02:15:11 My post with the most upvotes is also the one I self downvoted on.. weird
creations-chat 2020-10-15 02:19:36 <@456226577798135808> hey how do you get it down there? I'd like to do something similar at some point
creations-chat 2020-10-15 02:57:30 Floof List of my current projects:

Blimp

medium MBT

Bush plane

Builds I plan to work on: 

German rail gun tank proposal

Feel good inc windmill island

New AAV
Russian flying tank
creations-chat 2020-10-15 03:02:57 Was dat
creations-chat 2020-10-15 03:05:11 Also
A wood powered car
I wanna make one at some point
Those were cool
creations-chat 2020-10-15 03:32:47 So instead of building a new car
creations-chat 2020-10-15 03:34:44 I want to add a trailer to my half track that contains the wood gassification engine and champer as well as some exaust pipes  and then behind that a small wood pile
creations-chat 2020-10-15 03:37:29 It's already loosely based off a German half track so with a gassification engine It's about as "WW2 germany is desperate" as you can get.. also it brings my block count on it to 400 so I can get a rank for it
creations-chat 2020-10-15 04:06:47 What are the black parts?

Also yee it's really good
creations-chat 2020-10-15 04:07:59 Mine was smoll and spammy
creations-chat 2020-10-15 04:12:29 This is the ship I'm most happy with
creations-chat 2020-10-15 04:15:23 Also my post with the most upvotes..
creations-chat 2020-10-15 04:18:13 I'm wondering if it's like.. tacky?.. to upload all my current saves to creations as I'm new..
creations-chat 2020-10-15 04:29:55 <:peep:672665425028448286>
creations-chat 2020-10-15 04:32:12 Nah it's really needed
It honestly should still be 2 minutes
creations-chat 2020-10-15 04:36:17 So question

Anyone else do this weird thing where any time I build a smaller boat (which is most of the time Gunboats, PT boats and torp boats are really really fun)
I have this weird desire too make it's control as accurate as possible
So rudder only
With proper speed controls and also a working anchor
creations-chat 2020-10-15 04:44:33 Yeah
creations-chat 2020-10-15 04:50:21 Yeah I don't like having any other steering on my boats but rudder
Maybe some props in the front but only for docking and on separate controlls then the turning
creations-chat 2020-10-15 10:39:23 We don't do huge amounts of motor lock because we have blackouts from our DID and will likely not understand what it is we were building

So our builds are kinda capped in quality by that..
creations-chat 2020-10-15 10:41:36 We'll motor lock like.. the wings or tail.. small things.. but none of that shit where your entire jet looks like it went through the shredder as it sits on the build plate
creations-chat 2020-10-15 10:47:53 My skill really is capped
But to be honest I think it should make things more interesting? I have to get all my ranks like that.. so yeah.. that's not saying I don't do motor lock at all just not enough for the build to not be recognizable In Build mode
creations-chat 2020-10-15 10:49:41 I've never built a jet because they bore me.. ive built the mil v12 and an ekranoplan which both had jets though.. my first plane was a Caproni CA 3
creations-chat 2020-10-15 10:53:09 <a:OwO:652530834410307595>
creations-chat 2020-10-15 10:55:44 <:Pep_1:738582635307335690>
<:Pep_2:738582601782132779>
<:Pep_3:738582561764409455>
creations-chat 2020-10-15 10:59:30 I suck at doing turrets
And the current turret on my tank is kinda ruining it
So I have been for a while considering just ripping it off adding a interior to the tank adding a boom box and peace signs all over it and 2 huge signs dangling on either side of it that says "make love not war"

Because it gets me out of ruining the cool custom body with a horrible gun
creations-chat 2020-10-15 11:03:45 I'm also too scared to get into a game with someone to have them help me with a good gun..
creations-chat 2020-10-15 11:10:11 > scaredy cat
<@433617207734304778> 

Yes I am
Because I want it to not look good but also be really good in pvp.. like well armored..
creations-chat 2020-10-15 11:11:53 I'm not supposed to motor lock for it but it bugs out whenever I try to use them
creations-chat 2020-10-15 11:14:03 Whenever I put any motor lock on a gun it bugs way the fuck out
And I can't get good with WASD the same reason I can't fly a plane with it 
My hands jitter too much
creations-chat 2020-10-15 11:50:38 I have no mechs
Idk how to do mechs
Even though I think Howl's moving castle would be a cool one to build
creations-chat 2020-10-15 11:57:00 Actually I upvoted it because it took a solid 2 minutes for me to realize it was huge
He did a good job replicating it which is what he set out to do so.. upvote
creations-chat 2020-10-15 11:58:41 Wait I thought we were talking about the giant tutorial plane
What carrier?
creations-chat 2020-10-15 12:00:09 What?
creations-chat 2020-10-15 12:01:53 Yeah same
That's a good job in my book
I couldn't even tell
creations-chat 2020-10-15 12:27:11 Nice
creations-chat 2020-10-15 15:25:30 The only helicopters I'm good at are ones with 2 rotors fixed front and back or side by side or 1 top the other.. I'm bad at helis
creations-chat 2020-10-15 15:35:27 Dis boat has no ballast tonk
creations-chat 2020-10-15 15:36:43 I want to add some though

Wait really? It has alot of detail already
And I know the color is ass
creations-chat 2020-10-15 15:38:19 <@543819153279287327> I have an armed varient with a front mounted gun torpedoes depth charges and mine baskets
I just don't think it looks as nice because it's so culttered in detail
creations-chat 2020-10-15 15:39:20 I like how small and simple this one is
creations-chat 2020-10-15 15:41:20 Also I'm still learning how to make my pallet more detailed while maintaining the "black pink girl power" thing I have.. 
I think I got there in my half track's new paint but idk
creations-chat 2020-10-15 15:43:09 My Long wip submarine has a bay with 2 toothed doors that fold out and lower a mini sub
Although the mini sub is tutorial
creations-chat 2020-10-15 15:44:09 I wanna make a cyclops/seamoth at some point
creations-chat 2020-10-15 15:45:50 I have an ekranoplan
creations-chat 2020-10-15 15:50:28 I have a 2 fold sub I've been working on for forever
 And an I-400 sub that I've been working on too
Bitch carries a sub bat for smaller subs
The I-400s is larger as I carry a Japanese mini sub while the 2 fold is smaller because I used a tutorial sub I found
I also have a Submarine tender that lifts subs up onto the deck for repairs

That's why I want to make the subnautica cyclops I could make it actually work with a seamoth bay
creations-chat 2020-10-15 15:56:21 <@484529511468236802> yeah but it's old.. before I learned motor lock
creations-chat 2020-10-15 16:04:33 I've yet to see a halo covie CAS class cruiser
And I have no guts to make anything more then a phantom
creations-chat 2020-10-15 16:05:46 No.. they are more complicated than that..
creations-chat 2020-10-15 16:16:43 Nothing ever came of this it seams...
creations-chat 2020-10-15 16:20:00 I'm blind leave me be
creations-chat 2020-10-15 17:21:03 Why are all the things I want to build so mundane
I'm working on a crop duster and a cement truck
creations-chat 2020-10-15 17:28:15 Is motor lock even a glitch at this point? I feel like this is just a bathesda type situation where what started out as a glitch can't be removed because it makes the game better
creations-chat 2020-10-15 17:29:23 Use
Exploasives to stop the motors from locking
Use a second motor to rotate it to where you want it
Then lock it by exploading the tnt 
Keep the exploasives set to 0 of course
creations-chat 2020-10-15 17:32:08 What type of cement truck should I do? Front or back loaders?
creations-chat 2020-10-15 17:38:21 <@716757923103244348> basically is the cement poored from the front or back
Front would probably be easiest tbf
creations-chat 2020-10-15 17:49:22 Still learning how to paint and do that whole thing
I'm Slowly re painting slot of my old builds... But I like my black and pink theme so that's staying I'm just adding more texture and varient too it
creations-chat 2020-10-15 18:05:47 Y'all just gotta chill
creations-chat 2020-10-15 18:12:11 Can I come to brazil
creations-chat 2020-10-15 18:13:45 I'm working on it
Haz to add gassification chamber to half track

Even though I could use my 900 block tank I really wanna do it with my half track
creations-chat 2020-10-15 18:14:46 ^
creations-chat 2020-10-15 18:15:47 Real helpful -.-
creations-chat 2020-10-15 18:20:40 Dats piston
creations-chat 2020-10-15 18:22:56 The piston suspension never works for my stuff.. tho my stuff may just be too smoll
creations-chat 2020-10-15 18:33:41 So spinny one or not spinny one
creations-chat 2020-10-15 18:35:00 I think the spinny ones look cooler so probably spinny...
creations-chat 2020-10-15 18:36:18 Dis one seems easy enough
creations-chat 2020-10-15 18:38:00 The extra wheels that push down are going to be.. intresting... 

<@716757923103244348> I don't intend on having anything poor out it's not going to be anywhere near big enough.. I don't like making big things because we as a system just don't have the focus
creations-chat 2020-10-15 18:41:45 That moment when your low rider is larger then any tank I've ever built
creations-chat 2020-10-15 18:44:56 I love that
creations-chat 2020-10-15 18:45:57 Yeah they are weird trucks that you never really think about.. which is why I think it will be fun to make one
creations-chat 2020-10-15 19:05:26 <@484529511468236802> no offense or anything.. I'm terrible at detail so I'm nobody to talk.. but I think the lights could be better.. they are a pretty big feature it's important they look good..
creations-chat 2020-10-15 19:25:19 <@484529511468236802> I like the caseing.. can you make the top of it have control surfaces so there is a gap in the middle too? And then add a spot light behind a white cilinder for the lights...?
creations-chat 2020-10-15 19:28:05 Yeah that way it looks like the metal bars that cover them in the reference.. it looks really good
creations-chat 2020-10-15 19:32:38 What?
creations-chat 2020-10-15 19:35:42 Ooo... Okay that looks awesome
Like completely
Those are awesome
creations-chat 2020-10-15 19:37:41 Wait is the thing in top a window?
creations-chat 2020-10-15 20:25:50 Oof
creations-chat 2020-10-15 20:28:26 Hahahaha seeing his builds it honestly yes
creations-chat 2020-10-15 20:29:55 <@456226577798135808> is honestly one of my favorite builders here.. I just love boats and he builds the boats I don't have focus too and it's amazing
Good job dude
creations-chat 2020-10-15 20:31:25 Yes-
creations-chat 2020-10-15 21:29:26 I want to build my favorite fictonal airship ever
The spirit of adventure from the movie UP
It's my favorite because it's ridiculous be it well designed in such a way it feels like it could be a real airship

Anyways
The airship carries at least 9 planes but I can't identify them.. can anyone else?
creations-chat 2020-10-15 21:32:43 *what?*
creations-chat 2020-10-15 21:37:03 It really is beautiful
creations-chat 2020-10-15 21:38:06 They make sense when you consider where the aircraft are stored and how that would effect weight
I'm excited to do this
That's a 4 fold blimp
creations-chat 2020-10-15 21:39:30 If probably won't be complete for weeks because I'm an idiot with no focus
creations-chat 2020-10-15 21:42:13 We're a DID system... Big complicated builds are so hard for us
creations-chat 2020-10-16 01:42:17 Everyone: this fighter jet is-
Me: crop duster go brrrrr
creations-chat 2020-10-16 02:03:00 <@484529511468236802> eee that's amazing
creations-chat 2020-10-16 02:04:15 The hell? That looks amazing idk what they are on about
creations-chat 2020-10-16 02:07:42 I can't even complete a small blimp but I want to do the spirt of adventure

Im going to get the interior right too
Which means big musuam full of ze bones
creations-chat 2020-10-16 02:09:07 Honestly that musuam is going to be one of 2 hardest part
The other part is fitting 9 planes into it with a way to load and unload them
creations-chat 2020-10-16 02:11:52 Big ol blomp
creations-chat 2020-10-16 02:13:06 Adventure's out there

Also what's the reference plane <@484529511468236802>?
creations-chat 2020-10-16 02:14:07 Oo
Foldy boy

Your nose looks a little wonky..
creations-chat 2020-10-16 02:15:49 <@378381569645084672> yeah I agree
Zeplins are super uncanny just in there size and how out of place they actually look
These things are fucking massive
And they float barely keeping from just blowing away
creations-chat 2020-10-16 02:18:15 It's just insane that this massive structure

Is lighter then you
creations-chat 2020-10-16 02:23:07 So I decided to look into the real airship aircraft carrier
And uh

This was no help in couldn't find an explanation of the mechanisms that pulled the planes up or loaded them or anything..
creations-chat 2020-10-16 02:24:10 These images are not the most helpful...
They are only the system to get the planes in and out of the blimp

But that's the easiest part..
creations-chat 2020-10-16 02:26:47 Also I think we identified the planes
Because this definitely makes the most sense given the location and whatnot of the film and we know pixar did there research
creations-chat 2020-10-16 02:28:24 The house is boring
Fuck the house
I want to build the mile long aircraft carrying dinosaur musuam in the sky blimp
creations-chat 2020-10-16 04:43:33 I think I should start detailing now
creations-chat 2020-10-16 04:46:38 ^
creations-chat 2020-10-16 04:48:00 Has anyone made a proper ratte
With all of its guns working
And an interior including a vehicle bay for light trucks
creations-chat 2020-10-16 04:49:12 Cus I see half finished ones all the time
Where they add the guns and doors but there is no internal bay and none of the other buns but the big ones actually work
creations-chat 2020-10-16 04:52:53 I learn how to do things for the weirdest reasons
I want to build the spirt of adventure so I'm learning blimps
When I get around to doing howl's moving castle I'm going to learn how to make it walk.. and I that's going to be fun
creations-chat 2020-10-16 04:54:03 I don't think Howl's moving castle has been built
I really really want to do it
It's my second favorite movie
creations-chat 2020-10-16 05:03:37 Is it spammy to put firework turrets on the bottom of the blimp?
creations-chat 2020-10-16 06:39:20 Is there any better way to make a small wood pile?
creations-chat 2020-10-16 06:42:16 Alright
creations-chat 2020-10-16 21:21:32 Has anyone built the turtle submarine? It seems pretty simple to do
creations-chat 2020-10-16 22:24:53 wdyt?
creations-chat 2020-10-16 23:07:21 Getting closer to done
creations-chat 2020-10-17 04:24:26 Do different materials have different weights?
creations-chat 2020-10-17 04:25:45 Ight
creations-chat 2020-10-17 04:26:53 Are they the same weight? <@484529511468236802>
creations-chat 2020-10-17 04:28:54 Alright
And then ice is slippery
Fabric is extra friction.. anything else?
creations-chat 2020-10-17 04:37:18 
creations-chat 2020-10-17 07:04:32 I am making bazooka loaded grasshopper
creations-chat 2020-10-18 01:09:22 this guy in a rocket spamming turret just said "this noob needs to learn how to use real bombs rather then strapping rockets onto his plane"

but.. uh..

this was my plane
creations-chat 2020-10-18 01:12:16 <@!265819387498332160> it's rocket rosie.  it was a spotter plane that the pilot strapped bazookas to
creations-chat 2020-10-18 01:44:42 I have many many questions
creations-chat 2020-10-18 02:19:42 <@456226577798135808> I'ma get in and make it furry water ōwō
creations-chat 2020-10-18 02:21:48 Doubt
creations-chat 2020-10-18 03:46:24 I need help
creations-chat 2020-10-18 03:47:42 Like
Okay
I'm bad at airplanes.. especially small ones.. 

And I want help designing a small parasite fighter with actual decent control and Ballance..
That can be launched from an airship based off of these things
creations-chat 2020-10-18 08:38:04 Idec it's getting downvoted I'm so proud of my little grasshopper it's so fun to fly
creations-chat 2020-10-18 08:50:42 What the fuck
creations-chat 2020-10-19 00:58:59 I decided I want some form of "vibe mobile"
Not just unarmed.. but much like my boat it's unarmed with the necessary things for me to live out of it
I.e a cabin and some sitting areas and storage
I could do something like an RV but I think it would be cooler to make some form of military vehicle
creations-chat 2020-10-19 01:14:10 Anyone have a design for windowed hatches in tanks?
creations-chat 2020-10-19 02:05:11 My tank destroyer is now named named pussaiii killa
creations-chat 2020-10-19 02:35:18 I'd like that role
creations-chat 2020-10-19 05:33:11 I drew a thing.. didn't know where to post it..
creations-chat 2020-10-19 05:34:12 What would have been the right channel?
creations-chat 2020-10-19 05:35:59 It's based off of one of my builds 
I tried making an h8k
Failed
But made a super cool looking plane anyways
Then drew it
creations-chat 2020-10-19 05:46:37 This is going to seem super odd
But anyone got any ideas for a small scale cheracter sized keyboard? Like the music instrument
creations-chat 2020-10-19 11:46:37 Can anyone find what this thing is actually supposed to be? I built it based off of a vehicle in the music video for gorrilaz dirty harry
But I don't know what the actual truck is called
creations-chat 2020-10-19 11:51:13 Subnautica had cutscenes??
creations-chat 2020-10-19 16:53:32 Me: I'm bored I'ma make weird armored truck from gorrilaz music video
PCC: Let's have this be your most upvoted thing for some fucking reason?
creations-chat 2020-10-19 16:54:32 I'm already blind
Light mode has better contast
creations-chat 2020-10-19 21:46:06 <a:Spler:647021352955412482>
creations-chat 2020-10-19 22:16:39 <a:rave:549745590284845077>
creations-chat 2020-10-20 01:34:22 The time has come
creations-chat 2020-10-20 02:42:31 Best part about making the ratte
I can make the small details whatever the fuck I want
creations-chat 2020-10-20 04:21:29 I understand why the ratte was called "a land Cruiser"
Driving just the suspension around it feels the same as sailing a large ship
You can be going 300 speed and it feels like not going anywhere
creations-chat 2020-10-20 04:25:19 It goes fast it's just so big it doesn't feel like it
creations-chat 2020-10-20 04:26:38 I just realized
The motors are set to speed 15

*It can get faster*
creations-chat 2020-10-20 04:28:22 What exactly is your problem?.. I'm saying it can get faster then it already is and it already is too fast
creations-chat 2020-10-20 07:36:59 Something about this cross section is so fucking satisfying
creations-chat 2020-10-20 08:17:03 The bulbous bow
The second best mechanical term
First being the droop snoop
creations-chat 2020-10-20 08:24:35 Weird water line.. also no rudder? How do you intend on steering that?
creations-chat 2020-10-20 08:25:49 I like how people still complain about up/downvotes like bruh
creations-chat 2020-10-20 08:27:31 Because the mini is plane took more effort to detail get looking right as well as just being controllable.
creations-chat 2020-10-20 08:28:54 There is alot of effort in that and it takes far far more then 5-15 minutes. Building things at a smaller scale makes it harder as you have to still detail it well and have it be controllable at that small scale
creations-chat 2020-10-20 08:30:32 It looks good? I don't see anything wrong with that build that diserves a downvote. Your only comeplaint is that it's small. That's not a valid complaint

Also <@456226577798135808> looks good
creations-chat 2020-10-20 09:27:08 the turret is getting big enough that it will have 2 floors inside of it and a ladder going from the main tank too the turret
creations-chat 2020-10-20 09:32:22 I think this is the first ground vehicle I will make where the interior will take longer then the exterior and mechanics.
creations-chat 2020-10-20 09:33:36 <@720891502108344360> how is what possible? The ladder? You just make the entire space around the turret open so that the ladder turns around the inside of the tank without hitting anything
creations-chat 2020-10-20 09:40:09 <@720891502108344360> no the turret itself has too floors
Tge screenshot Is a floor below the turret and on the "top deck" of the tank
And below that there are 2 floors within the tank
Also to explain the ladder thing
creations-chat 2020-10-20 09:41:17 No? I'm also building a ratte -.- I just have never built a ground vehicle this big
creations-chat 2020-10-20 12:48:10 Tank turret is chonk
creations-chat 2020-10-20 12:56:59 Those are cool helis!
creations-chat 2020-10-20 12:58:30 Oh
Wait
I thought they were original.. even if they are modified tutorials they look really cool so good job
creations-chat 2020-10-20 13:01:34 <@543819153279287327> I had some fun with it
We don't really know what it would have looked like beyond vauge shape and it's gun
I wanted to make mine a tad different then most
creations-chat 2020-10-20 13:04:06 Yeah see I ditched the "battleship turret" design and decided to.. basically upscale a tank turret to radiculois scale.. and I think it looks pretty cool
creations-chat 2020-10-20 13:05:53 Pretty much
The duel gun is required for it to be a ratte..

Also the body is not detailed at all
I built it's shell and the gun and the door for the vehicle bay and then turned it off because my head started to hurt
creations-chat 2020-10-20 13:07:45 I still really like that you can climb up into the turret from the tank through a ladder in the gun well
I've never built a tank big enough to do that before so that was exciting
creations-chat 2020-10-20 13:10:36 I'm super sceptical of this thing being any use in pvp.. so I think I'm just going to make it as fun to drive around in non pvp and pvp both as possible
creations-chat 2020-10-20 13:24:09 Satisfying cutaway~
creations-chat 2020-10-20 20:15:41 Is the game safe? I don't want to work on my ratte if it might be deleted..
creations-chat 2020-10-20 20:17:35 When did it start..?
creations-chat 2020-10-20 20:20:37 Oh
Okay
I was sleeping
I should be fine
creations-chat 2020-10-20 20:36:49 Oop. I censored the word the first time then right after said it. Danm I'm stupid
creations-chat 2020-10-20 20:40:22 When I was building my ratte someone came up and said I needed to add a big `no no star`because you can't call it a German super tank without one...
creations-chat 2020-10-20 20:49:12 *it's really weird too see a German cross on a non ww2 tank my brain kinda farts whenever I stumble across it*
creations-chat 2020-10-20 20:50:13 The moon by now
Probably
It's mush
creations-chat 2020-10-20 20:52:32 Yeah but I don't like modern tanks as much as older ones and it's always amusing for my brain to remember "oh yeah.. heh.. they are still a country that has tanks"
creations-chat 2020-10-20 20:58:35 You know what would be cool to make
An Arctic research center
Basiclly
A giant rolling research station with a vehicle bay for snow mobiles
creations-chat 2020-10-20 21:05:15 Also I need help designing a small truck too fit in my vehicle bay of the ratte
creations-chat 2020-10-20 21:06:52 I just need to Know how to do suspension and such as it has to be under 5 blocks tall and 7 blocks wide
creations-chat 2020-10-20 21:36:16 Might make a ladder up the side of the gun like this.. though I really like the overlooks so the gunnery commander can get a clear view
creations-chat 2020-10-20 23:31:20 The mechanism to make these back guns work was such a pain. a super complicated toggle stop so that they both can point forward or backwards but don't get stuck
creations-chat 2020-10-21 00:38:03 Vehicle bay.. should be able to fit a truck and and a few gollioths.. not detailed yet
creations-chat 2020-10-21 02:28:57 
creations-chat 2020-10-21 02:29:58 It's not going to stay like that I'm using that so I can see better
creations-chat 2020-10-21 02:31:54 But what do you think if it as a vehicle bay?
creations-chat 2020-10-21 02:47:30 fuck it. more cannons
creations-chat 2020-10-21 02:48:36 yeah fair. I just backlist everyone
creations-chat 2020-10-21 02:50:21 *litterally just adding ship cannons at this point*
creations-chat 2020-10-21 04:19:39 *needs more gun*
creations-chat 2020-10-21 04:22:04 on which ones? top i used trail bottom i used sparklers
creations-chat 2020-10-21 05:15:18 It's basically done just needs to me material-ed?.. and painted
creations-chat 2020-10-21 05:17:18 Yeah.. pretty much
creations-chat 2020-10-21 05:19:10 I'm not really that intrested in keeping accurate to the most generally accepted version of a very very very vauge tank proposal
creations-chat 2020-10-21 09:06:44 I'm starting to run out of keys for my ratte
Anyone have a good "extra keys" thing that works for plane crazy?
creations-chat 2020-10-21 09:07:46 Keys on your keyboard
I've run out of buttons to push and I still have more stuff to control
creations-chat 2020-10-21 09:12:03 No there are too many it lags out the game

The guns (fake and real) on the left and right side each have there own key controls.
 The rear guns and AA are mouse control.
The front AT gun is mouse control.

The main turret is button control.

The whole thing stears with WASDEQ.

The 3 Gollioth tracked mines stored in it's vehicle bay use arrow keys.

The vehicle bay door uses keys.

The truck  that sits in the bay uses keys.

The trucks gun uses mouse.
creations-chat 2020-10-21 09:13:43 I want to add controls for 2 guided missiles stored in silos but I have run out of good keys
creations-chat 2020-10-22 00:23:36 Cool graphic I found
creations-chat 2020-10-22 00:25:31 It's a graphic because it's displaying the process of something via simplification
creations-chat 2020-10-22 00:28:00 So apparently
It was a common thing for Battleships turrets too not actually be connected to the ship.. like.. they were held on rollers by gravity but there was nothing holding them down.. if you were to pick up the ship it's massive turrets would just fall out.. that's.. kinda wack.. apparently the bismarck's were thrown off like that
I knew the bismarck's were thrown off but I assumed that like.. it was because water pressure blowing them out or something
creations-chat 2020-10-22 00:33:51 Can someone show me how to make the iorn cross in wing pannels
I've seen it done I just need to know how
creations-chat 2020-10-22 00:34:56 <@708185644706431038> yeah I knew that I just need a screenshot of the layout of it.
creations-chat 2020-10-22 00:36:32 <a:Pet:704326955507646565>
creations-chat 2020-10-22 00:38:18 Ah okay
Thank you
creations-chat 2020-10-22 00:39:34 The iorn cross isn't a bad symbol? It's still used today?
creations-chat 2020-10-22 00:41:02 ?
creations-chat 2020-10-22 00:46:50 I hate that b17 tutorial
It's not even good
Lmao
creations-chat 2020-10-22 00:49:39 Superior japanese engineering go brrr
creations-chat 2020-10-22 01:57:27 I'm going to be doing the paint for my ratte.. what paint should I do? I don't want to do this this looks hella boring
creations-chat 2020-10-22 01:58:50 Well I don't want to do an all grey paint I hate the look of it.. and also it's the most common one I see..
creations-chat 2020-10-22 02:01:16 <@551806781609869313> yeah 
Any tank paint scheme will work..
Because the common "grey" wasn't a paint it was lack of paint.
creations-chat 2020-10-22 02:02:31 I hate it being grey -.-
creations-chat 2020-10-22 02:03:30 I might make a custom paint...
creations-chat 2020-10-22 02:06:18 It's not painted or even given the right materials yes I intended to do that

Also my ratte is supposed to look diffrent then the super common depiction of it which I think I succeeded with
The side guns on mine are almost reminiscent of a battleship
creations-chat 2020-10-22 02:11:21 Also mine has a vehicle bay which I've never seen in another ratte 
So I'm proud of dat
creations-chat 2020-10-22 05:25:39 Can you use tnt for guns to fire other things?
creations-chat 2020-10-22 05:35:59 <@221487880487436288> a better what?
creations-chat 2020-10-22 05:37:24 In an hour? With how detailed this one is I doubt it..
creations-chat 2020-10-22 06:12:39 Someone is bragging about how big there complex is when it looks from the outside like a fucking borg cube mf mine may not be as big but it moves
creations-chat 2020-10-22 06:20:41 Alright
One monstrosity down
One more too go-
help 2020-10-22 06:57:43 I need a design for a compact motor bike.. I want to fit it within my ratte
creations-chat 2020-10-22 09:10:02 wdyt of my lil truck?
creations-chat 2020-10-22 10:00:21 should I add search lights too my ratte?
creations-chat 2020-10-22 10:13:08 <@581846949901369365> I have ratte that I never seem to be finished with
creations-chat 2020-10-22 10:14:09 Hull and then mechanics (IE. Rudder, steering, ballast and engine)
bot-central 2020-10-22 14:20:06 !expertservers
creations-chat 2020-10-22 14:23:14 I'm dreading a new map because it means there might be a bridge and my ratte may be exposed for what it is-
creations-chat 2020-10-22 14:39:34 *Its bigger then my ratte*
creations-chat 2020-10-22 14:49:24 > wtf why would you make a ratte so small
<@685909594932773033> 
It's roughly to scale of a roblox cheracter but it's smaller then most as I play on a fucking potato
creations-chat 2020-10-22 14:52:11 Because I used wedge blocks for some of the corners. I've considered changing it but.. honestly it's a long list of things I need to do it's still a wip
creations-chat 2020-10-22 15:06:25 How do you do the thing where it shows the borders for blocks?
creations-chat 2020-10-22 15:07:42 Ah.. they are helpfull for some things tbh.. ships hauls especially.. which is why I kinda wanted them
creations-chat 2020-10-22 15:20:48 CA. 3
creations-chat 2020-10-22 15:40:07 I love pissing people off by saying they have sexy ikea jets
creations-chat 2020-10-22 15:41:28 I think the smallest you can get is 3×1
creations-chat 2020-10-22 15:46:42 I made my AA look better
creations-chat 2020-10-22 15:50:03 I understood none of that..
creations-chat 2020-10-22 15:55:37 That's kinda what I was actually going for.. I love the kugelblitz for a really dumb reason..
creations-chat 2020-10-22 15:58:17 The front of sparklers stick to things?

Also I really like the idea of the ratte having these turrets over the other AA.. they look awesome
creations-chat 2020-10-22 16:03:19 Yeah it's awesome
That and it's moving on a tank
creations-chat 2020-10-22 16:41:12 alright I am happy with this AA
creations-chat 2020-10-22 16:44:17 *the original vauge concept didn't specify maus turrets (though I am considering adding them.. idk...) and I like the kugelblitz AA more.*
creations-chat 2020-10-22 16:56:52 <@484529511468236802> hi yes may I scale that down for my vehicle bay on my rat?
creations-chat 2020-10-22 17:02:28 As much as I hate the idea of the maus having 2 ratte turrets.. I'm not going to stop being given shit for not having them huh.. ughhhhh ok I'll see how it looks..
creations-chat 2020-10-22 17:06:43 As I said.. I hate that depiction of it.. also *I'm keeping the kugelblitz turrets they are amazing you shush*
creations-chat 2020-10-22 17:09:37 They feel like ship turrets and I am trying really hard to lean into the land warship feel
The back turrets are the only thing I might change even though I fucking hate the idea of it having maus turrets
creations-chat 2020-10-22 17:11:14 Agggghhhhh
But that interpretation of it is soooo badddddddd ahhhhh ok
creations-chat 2020-10-22 17:18:36 <@484529511468236802> also the kugelblitz is cook because it was a ball turret
The gunner moved with the gun so if the gun was verticle he faced upwards too.
And it was on a panzer 4 body so he had to do that while already moving
creations-chat 2020-10-22 17:28:25 <@456226577798135808> yeah
But the 2 maus turrets are compleatly fucking random and I hate them being there
If they were going to add more tank turrets they would be something more manageable then the maus's.
creations-chat 2020-10-22 17:37:38 <@!484529511468236802> I hate you. and I hate everything about this.. but it does look alright.. so..
creations-chat 2020-10-22 17:38:48 UGGGHHHHHH I THUGHT THE SIDES WERE AGHH OK
creations-chat 2020-10-22 17:40:16 also they look oversized because my maus is kinda small
creations-chat 2020-10-22 17:41:46 I don't. I hate tanks. I just want a fucking ratte
creations-chat 2020-10-22 17:43:50 As to why the whole thing is smaller it's because I don't want a fold in it.. I play on a potato.
creations-chat 2020-10-22 17:51:10 Well.. either a cog using wing pannels.. or pistons.. niether are compact...
creations-chat 2020-10-22 17:54:02 <@484529511468236802> bro I'm sorry for the butchering of the maus turrets I'm 2 days without sleep and I thought the sides were flat
creations-chat 2020-10-22 17:55:38 I am
I promise
I'm also making them angled outwards from the sides like a smart mammal rather then the stupid shit I was doing trying to fold the barrel down
creations-chat 2020-10-22 18:01:41 You ever just notice that one thing that would not be hard to fix but you keep passing it off as "nobody will notice so why bother" but you notice and it hurts your soul?
creations-chat 2020-10-22 18:03:39 ||the 2 machine guns on the front are off||
creations-chat 2020-10-22 18:04:55 It hurts. And I have no intent on fixing it rn.
creations-chat 2020-10-22 18:14:59 alright
creations-chat 2020-10-22 18:16:00 <@484529511468236802> here is your turret ree
creations-chat 2020-10-22 18:17:17 Because fuck you that's why 
I need to cover up the locking mechanism of the gun

creations-chat 2020-10-23 04:24:52 *Your torpedo carrier needs to worry about my tank*
creations-chat 2020-10-23 04:45:23 <@484529511468236802>
creations-chat 2020-10-23 04:46:33 <@484529511468236802> yeah I want to add something there but I don't know what..
creations-chat 2020-10-23 14:39:13 For clerification the Pz4 is so small and cute lil bab because I wanted to be able to fit it in my ratte's vehicle bay
creations-chat 2020-10-23 14:45:02 Why
creations-chat 2020-10-23 14:46:44 I kinda like how long it is.. it counteracts the massive gun I decided to stick on
creations-chat 2020-10-23 14:47:54 Idc about downvotes I was explaining why I left it be long boi
creations-chat 2020-10-23 18:39:21 Ehhh I might remake my Pz 4
I mean my current one is OP but... Like.. it kinda looks terrible
creations-chat 2020-10-23 18:41:12 <@456226577798135808> YES I fucking love that thing
It's so stupid looking I love it
creations-chat 2020-10-23 18:42:22 
creations-chat 2020-10-23 18:49:13 Why do people keep coming up to my builds and saying they are shit because they don't have "custom suspension"
Like
They work just fine without your fancy shit wtf you want
creations-chat 2020-10-23 18:54:03 <@484529511468236802> I do have piston suspension on my ratte.. I don't on any other builds.. what is it I don't understand it.
creations-chat 2020-10-23 18:57:04 <@484529511468236802> this is the suspension for my ratte.. it's the only custom suspension I know off..
creations-chat 2020-10-23 18:58:05 How the fu- how does that work?..
creations-chat 2020-10-23 19:02:25 Also 
Fun fact
The ratte's back ramp likes to get stuck on shit
So I have the wheels set to lift the entire body 4 blocks all
When I do so it moves the wheels inwards and so it kinda looks like it's tippy toeing.. the wheels still work like that too so it gives it alot of clearance. But it's much funnier to just leave it anchored like that and afk with ratte rippytowed
creations-chat 2020-10-23 19:49:33 <@484529511468236802> I might make a more compact version of that.. it's pretty danm cool.. like a modern version of the hwatcha are you adding actual rockets?
creations-chat 2020-10-23 20:10:18 There should be a role that blocks people from having a vote staff can use on mass downvoters
creations-chat 2020-10-24 04:49:07 <@591167008855556096> is that supposed to be the gustav gun or the monstur super ultra heavy tank version of it?
creations-chat 2020-10-24 04:51:36 The monster is cool
Though the "isn't the gustav gun on a ratte body" interpritation of it is fucking stupid
I like the idea it would have been mounted on 2 panzer 4 bodies and then heavily armored and giveore guns and AA
creations-chat 2020-10-24 04:58:35 The largest I've built is a light frigate lol
creations-chat 2020-10-24 14:30:45 My Russian tank kicks up snow and I find it endlessly amusing
creations-chat 2020-10-24 14:35:54 It's also pretty convincing.. combined with the tiny bits of smoke around the engine and the gun it looks like heat radiating off of it in the cold winter
creations-chat 2020-10-24 16:35:03 Why the downvotes on my mark 4 <@480746414293647360> (this isn't a complaint this is me asking because I want to work on it but don't know what else to add)
creations-chat 2020-10-24 16:37:08 Oh shit I did 
Sorry Idk why my computer does that so often..
creations-chat 2020-10-24 17:01:25 I mean.. I just looked at a refrence and my mark 4 is the right width the bars are just a bit big.. so..
the-dump 2020-10-24 19:22:06 
creations-chat 2020-10-24 21:09:43 How can a tank with no armor and no guns sit in spawn and destroy other builds at range..?
creations-chat 2020-10-24 21:11:14 Well I'm going to prove that wrong
creations-chat 2020-10-24 21:12:47 Nope

creations-chat 2020-10-25 06:29:15 They really are
Pree dreadnoughts are iornclads with more guns
Like
Basically gun Spam
creations-chat 2020-10-25 06:30:19 It seems odd for it to be in the ocean
creations-chat 2020-10-25 06:41:09 I tried to make it look like an actual ww1 photo
I think I did pretty well lmao
creations-chat 2020-10-25 06:46:32 I kinda like the look of "spam" dreadnoughts with there buldges and tons of guns
creations-chat 2020-10-25 07:01:33 I think I broke my colorizer
creations-chat 2020-10-25 07:17:35 I want to make a Maginot line bunker turret? Do you think I could motor lock the whole thing into the ground and still have the fun move up and down?
creations-chat 2020-10-25 07:18:58 Or if it raise the gun up will it not be able to come back down??
creations-chat 2020-10-25 07:21:57 But the terrain would have to be towering making it kinda pointless
I want to have it clip into the ground and just do a small clearing of custom terrain
creations-chat 2020-10-25 10:38:43 how would I go about doing these bars on this turret?
creations-chat 2020-10-25 10:45:42 ehhhhh idk
creations-chat 2020-10-25 11:26:48 Can someone 1st explain to me how to motor lock builds into the ground.. and second say if this gun would work sticking up top from a motor locked bunker or not
creations-chat 2020-10-25 11:28:07 <@738702049113538600> wdym? Like stuff won't move?
creations-chat 2020-10-25 11:30:15 No they won't..? You can clip stuff into the ground and have stuff down there I just don't know how it works
I want to clip a bunker down there and have a "pop up" Maginot line turret
creations-chat 2020-10-25 11:31:51 You motor lock it into the ground and anchor it
I've seen it done before but I don't know how you do it
Someone did it with an among us map
creations-chat 2020-10-25 11:33:44 Yeah but that doesn't matter if your seat is in the build 
I want to know if having a section of it aviubr the ground
With that turret would work
creations-chat 2020-10-25 17:01:30 My builds sometimes get 54 upvotes and then other times get 2 at about the same quality of build.. it's weird but eh
creations-chat 2020-10-25 17:03:32 Mmm
Colorized images of panzers are sexy af
creations-chat 2020-10-25 17:10:27 *it's starting to look like a real photo lmao*
creations-chat 2020-10-25 17:11:42 I want cillendrical tnt
creations-chat 2020-10-25 17:48:35 I think it's a good start!
creations-chat 2020-10-25 18:25:29 The "snow tracks" have a weird benefit of Making anyone that hits them experience a lag spikes and flip over
And it happens before shredders cut so shredder bugs can't hit my wheels
creations-chat 2020-10-25 18:31:40 <@484529511468236802> your pfp makes me happy
I just like happy doggos
creations-chat 2020-10-25 19:37:07 turret upgrade
creations-chat 2020-10-25 20:31:01 That seems like a pretty bad idea
creations-chat 2020-10-25 20:32:11 I mean.. what about invisible blocks in PVP?
creations-chat 2020-10-25 20:33:30 Eh.. I like the idea to be able to toggle motors invisible
Nothing else though..
creations-chat 2020-10-25 20:34:52 <@484529511468236802> what do you think of the new turret?
creations-chat 2020-10-25 20:36:45 I ping <@484529511468236802> òuó
creations-chat 2020-10-25 20:38:51 I took the snow rope thingies off my tank.. because while they looked really good they slowed it down and it already only has a max speed of 123

<@484529511468236802> I can't.. I'm super tired and I'm going to try start going to bed so my laptop is off..
creations-chat 2020-10-25 21:50:21 <@530364247646011402> I have one
It loads torps in the back and moves them to the front to be fired from tubes
It's not finished or painted or detailed so you get no peaks.
creations-chat 2020-10-25 22:10:52 I want to make an abram.. but they are so popular if I fuck it up it will be constantly called out.. and I don't think I'm good enough to not fuck it up.. anyone know of a Russian or Chinese or just.. any equivalent tank? Like a tank of the same era same kinda idea but not the abram..
creations-chat 2020-10-25 22:14:08 Ooh.. what's with it's lights? I feel like I've seen these around too but hopefully they aren't so common mine will be called shit for some tiny thing by everyone and there mom..
creations-chat 2020-10-25 22:18:32 Wow.. it looks so weirdly sleek.. like I kinda like it but it's weird.. it looks so.. modern..ehh
creations-chat 2020-10-25 22:19:47 *no*
creations-chat 2020-10-25 22:21:24 I'm not bored of popular tanks it's just whenever I build them People go "well it's missing this detail I saw some other one with so bad"
And it just sucks
I might do the T 90
I want to do cold war tanks and modern ish ones as I've mostly done ww2 stuff..
creations-chat 2020-10-25 22:23:24 No it just sucks being held to extreamly high standereds because so many people have made something that your's isn't remarkable

<@530364247646011402> I already made that
creations-chat 2020-10-25 22:25:44 That's not a-
creations-chat 2020-10-25 22:26:56 I was thinking about doing that one
But it looks similar enough to the abram I can see people assuming it's just a really bad abram..
creations-chat 2020-10-25 22:30:29 I wanna make a working BT-5 at some point too..
creations-chat 2020-10-25 22:31:30 I recently started one but I got bored fell asleep and didn't save it
creations-chat 2020-10-25 22:34:15 Soviet tanks kind all look the same
And I like it.. they all have the same esthetic
creations-chat 2020-10-25 22:38:34 I think it goes a little bit beyond just the gun
Because I'm including cold war tanks too
They all feel kind of similar it's interesting to me as someone who is into art and design.. how an interwar tank and a cold war tank can feel so similar
creations-chat 2020-10-25 22:40:08 Yeah
I really like there smaller ones 
With all the guns and little nobs and whistles exposed
All the little variens of the tankettes.. it's cool
creations-chat 2020-10-25 22:42:34 I mean..
No
Other countries just weren't very special and the things russia "copied" were just them feeling the same ground for how to do the whole tank thing as others countries
creations-chat 2020-10-25 22:44:42 Wikipedia even does it saying that the Russian flying tank was based off of it's allies Flying tanks
Which.. no? They don't source this either...

creations-chat 2020-10-26 07:57:40 Oh
Okay that might be fair
The largest boat I've made was a 2 fold JMDF MHDD and a 2 fold frigate
creations-chat 2020-10-26 08:37:19 Can someone explain how you do custom suspension?..
creations-chat 2020-10-26 08:39:20 That doesn't explain anything

creations-chat 2020-10-26 10:02:17 <@524324517431214100> I was doing it to see if someone would notice
I'll fix it lol
creations-chat 2020-10-26 10:04:07 Idk I thought it would be amusing to see how long it took for someone to notice
Not that long apparently
About an hour

creations-chat 2020-10-26 22:14:41 how is this suspension looking? it's fairly compact and I intend on using it for a panzer 4 *x3*
creations-chat 2020-10-26 22:19:00 Trust me
I had to make a single color coded version in the corner of my plot because I kept getting confused as I worked on it
So whenever I would tinker with it I would update the guide so that I knew how it would be..
creations-chat 2020-10-26 22:21:10 I'm sure there is some better way of doing it and I'm doing something wrong
But I'm a complete noob and so I'm pretty proud of getting this far with little help from anything as a guide
creations-chat 2020-10-26 22:25:42 Wtf are you on a paragraph is 8 sentences. Or are you one of those "it's longer then 7 words I won't read it" people...

creations-chat 2020-10-26 22:41:18 <@462077072399925250> what?
creations-chat 2020-10-27 21:46:53 I'm making a new ratte more closely based in the source material (where as my other one is kinda my interpritation of the concept)
creations-chat 2020-10-27 21:48:27 I've made it's gun.. but honestly the maus seems really boring to build... It's alot of straight lines no detail
creations-chat 2020-10-28 11:20:23 "if I fits, I sits"
creations-chat 2020-10-28 11:48:30 I really really like the armor plates on the side of it.. like the flush black lines and the ladders..
creations-chat 2020-10-28 11:50:39 I'm proud of it
creations-chat 2020-10-28 11:57:31 That maus tho
creations-chat 2020-10-28 11:59:26 That's not really saying much.. the maus is actually a block with alot of flat surface.. but it does have some details and could be painted better... The turret though is... *Shudders*
creations-chat 2020-10-28 12:01:33 Yeah it did
The maus is hella boring to build
Because it's very very lacking detail wise
creations-chat 2020-10-28 12:03:14 It really is
creations-chat 2020-10-28 13:34:37 I might not add an engine room so I can make the vehicle bay bigger because.. I would rather be able to carry my panzer 4 and a truck then a small truck and some usless decorative engines...
creations-chat 2020-10-28 16:42:35 Me looking at this chat wondering what is going on:
creations-chat 2020-10-28 16:48:26 It's a dog.. also Damm and I thought my new rat was big
creations-chat 2020-10-28 16:51:33 If he fits he sits
creations-chat 2020-10-28 16:55:03 my sexy vehicle bay
creations-chat 2020-10-28 16:57:17 The ratte can carry 2 of my panzer 4's and it's kinda wac- LOL poor SL 096
creations-chat 2020-10-28 17:10:54 My ratte gets nocked around in public servers
Which is why I made my Suspension so if you hit my wheels you get flung to England
creations-chat 2020-10-28 17:12:09 It also has anchors but that's more for docking my truck in it
creations-chat 2020-10-28 17:16:42 I changed it to run on Nuclear power.. so it's a much smaller engine? Not unrealistic just different.
Also the vehicle bay is epic 
The whole floor folds down into a ramp
creations-chat 2020-10-28 17:28:16 Weez me ratte sits 3 blocks above the ground on its tracks.. and I have a system that lifts the Suspension up by 6 blocks
creations-chat 2020-10-28 17:30:01 Mitsubishi ki-20 heavy bomber
It was massive with passages and engine rooms in the wings
creations-chat 2020-10-28 17:33:41 <@246412229400985602> no that's not a real plane (well it's based off one kinda but not nearly the same)
He means the parasite fighters..
creations-chat 2020-10-28 21:23:04 Why has nobody made a turtle?
creations-chat 2020-10-28 21:25:35 It's so simple it's radiculois that nobody has made one
creations-chat 2020-10-28 21:28:01 But it's hella historic and could work at least somewhat on pvp for what it was meant for
creations-chat 2020-10-28 21:29:27 No I'm talking about this turtle
creations-chat 2020-10-28 21:35:57 Yeah it was

creations-chat 2020-10-29 22:21:52 I'm waiting for someone to downvote my post because it wasn't about a truck
creations-chat 2020-10-29 22:27:09 <@720751430595772418> it's because I accidentally tightened the suspension too much when I stopped the tank before getting out in the truck to record.
I actually loosened it in the video and was kinda hoping nobody noticed it being too tight in the first place.
creations-chat 2020-10-30 14:17:39 <@422068861995581440> I did too

creations-chat 2020-11-01 21:51:22 <@456226577798135808> well 
I spent a week building a ratte based on my own artistic interpritation of the concept
Then decided to do the normal one everyone does
However I spend so long on big projects because I don't work on them straight on for days on end
I work on them in chunks and do small things in-between like my teliporting half track
creations-chat 2020-11-02 00:54:49 
help 2020-11-02 00:55:20 How do you motor lock on turrets without them getting all shaky?
creations-chat 2020-11-02 00:56:03 Never

bug-reports 2020-11-03 02:56:34 Hi
Yes
Your servers are down
creations-chat 2020-11-03 09:35:41 So I was just informed that I'm not allowed to call anything a half track if it doesn't have motor tracks.. I don't know what else you would call these? Like I'm sorry I didn't feel like scaling it up to an impractical scale so I can have laggy ass tracks
creations-chat 2020-11-03 09:37:43 It's a half track -.-
Doesn't matter if it doesn't have motor tracks it's a danm half track.
creations-chat 2020-11-03 09:38:48 Actually that one is an artillery peice I'm working on a flak one
creations-chat 2020-11-03 10:45:19 I built one but the controls were so complicated and it was so hard to get in the air just because of how much the controls required I got rid of it
creations-chat 2020-11-03 11:25:21 Danm
Kettenkrad isn't getting as much love as the bigger half tracks 
Even though it's by far the superior one in cuteness
creations-chat 2020-11-03 21:39:14 Lol
creations-chat 2020-11-03 21:49:33 Our overlords at roblox HQ decided to finally snuff out the resistance against there adopt me supremely and killed plane crazy by fucking with motor lock
creations-chat 2020-11-03 21:51:05 What the actual fuck
That's some serious tutorial/low effort shit and you got 20 upvotes
creations-chat 2020-11-03 21:53:45 Also
Mwahahaha I rarely use motor lock because if I do I'll switch alters and forget what I was doing and confuse myself 


But


It finally payed off mwahaha
creations-chat 2020-11-03 21:56:00 Hopefully Rick can get it working as it was again..
creations-chat 2020-11-03 21:58:30 Luckily the only build of mine where motor lock is seriously needed is my ratte and that's just for the side detail pannels

I can pull those up with rope and suspension tho
creations-chat 2020-11-03 22:00:01 Oh
All my good pvp shit is broken
But my fun shit is all fine
creations-chat 2020-11-03 22:11:57 New naenae
creations-chat 2020-11-03 22:14:04 Better start applying that fine meshing
creations-chat 2020-11-03 22:15:41 So many guns
creations-chat 2020-11-04 05:21:26 Creations is so danm sad rn
creations-chat 2020-11-04 15:27:25 Idk wtf is up with this ratte
Straight up be looking like a ship
But I kinda want to make one
creations-chat 2020-11-04 15:30:27 I am Infact not that -.-
creations-chat 2020-11-04 16:02:24 <@564503356576628737> I will take you up on that challenge just for how stupid that is
creations-chat 2020-11-04 16:17:21 The flying half track feedback is alot more split then I thought it would be
creations-chat 2020-11-04 23:40:00 Apparently my ratte is beyond voting
creations-chat 2020-11-04 23:42:37 Yeah
creations-chat 2020-11-04 23:44:54 Wait siren head isn't SCP
SCP is way too cool for that dumb shit

Siren head is like.. a weird artist's creature that was popularized by *throws up a bit* tIc ToC


This vvv
creations-chat 2020-11-04 23:47:44 Even the original painter doesn't like it
It's one of his least favorite paintings
 For good reason he has much scarier a d intresting cheracters like long horse
creations-chat 2020-11-05 05:34:40 I kinda wanna make the finnish race ca- I mean tank
With both systems for steering it had
creations-chat 2020-11-05 05:56:04 <@658140951273013248> I will stab you you ever make that joke again I swear to santa
creations-chat 2020-11-05 06:00:20 I'm also going to make the Russian flying tankette
An Italian flying tankette on basiclly a mini CA 3 glider

I already have a German flying Kettenkrad

Might do some form of american flying small ground vehicle? Idk what yet
creations-chat 2020-11-05 06:02:11 Wait
Fucking duh
A jeep
creations-chat 2020-11-05 07:12:31 
creations-chat 2020-11-05 08:08:17 So currently my glider drops the Gollioth and the kettenkrad as 2 different peices separately
So I can drop the Gollioth off one place use it while flying around and then deploy the kettenkrad..

But what if I make it so that it deploys with the kettenkrad as a trailer like this?
creations-chat 2020-11-05 08:20:29 <@564503356576628737> there are a few ways that I can do smaller treads
One is to have single cillinders function as normal wheels with motors and angle them downwards slightly and use tank steering
You can also use conveyors and either propeller engines or I've seen control surfaces for smaller things


It's called a kettenkrad it's the best and cutest vehicle ever ò.ó
creations-chat 2020-11-05 08:22:19 > yes
> I heard people even considered submersible aircraft carriers
<@564503356576628737> 
Not just considered the I 400 was built and they are also cool as fuck
Not as cool as kettenkrads
But still cool as fuck
creations-chat 2020-11-05 08:25:42 Because I kinda dislike when massive builds get a lot of praise for there detail.. because it's way way way easier to detail a massive build then a smaller one
Smaller builds like to scale tanks are way more impressive when they have that level of detail yet don't get the upvotes because they are too small and thus "low effort" and that's kinda bs and annoys me idk..
creations-chat 2020-11-05 08:29:43 I disagree. 
Though I guess it is unfair to downvote a single person for something I hate about this community

This is what I agree with vvv
creations-chat 2020-11-05 08:33:20 I think it's incredibly abnoxious how people praise massive highly detailed things over tiny highly detailed things

The big thing may have way more space to detail making it take way more time.. but they also have far far more space.. and when people accomplish the same level of detail on a smaller build it's far far more impressive
creations-chat 2020-11-05 08:35:39 ~~The cool kids build 8 plot builds fold them out from 2 accounts and link them together idk what your in about.~~
creations-chat 2020-11-05 08:37:28 I would love to make a city in plane crazy based off a mass collaboration
That would be so so cool to do though I have no idea how you would organize that
creations-chat 2020-11-05 08:39:00 I haven't seen a subnautica based build yet
Which I have been eagerly waiting for with that
creations-chat 2020-11-05 08:41:44 I don't intend on doing any contests because I take forever to build fucking anything to my satisfaction

I've spent almost a week now working on this and I'm still not happy with it

(It's a kettenkrad strapped to a glider for deployment similar to the Russian flying tank)
creations-chat 2020-11-05 08:44:48 I want to make an oil rig
creations-chat 2020-11-05 08:46:51 Well alot of oil rigs are underwater

True
creations-chat 2020-11-05 08:48:28 <@456226577798135808> maybe have the turrets flung off and the masts funnels and bridge caved in so it looks like a wreck

Wait no british turrets were screwed down never mind
creations-chat 2020-11-05 09:21:59 <@456226577798135808> have you done any Japanese pree dreadnought ships?
creations-chat 2020-11-05 12:57:57 Can we all agree the over detailed tank needs to make hall of fame?
creations-chat 2020-11-05 13:19:02 I think it looks good
It's a better jet then I can do
creations-chat 2020-11-05 13:31:50 I think the truck needs some work on the detailing but it's looking really good so far especially with the turret

*It'd be better as a half track tho-*
creations-chat 2020-11-05 13:33:28 That will be my response to all trucks 
"It's great and all but where are the tank treads?"
creations-chat 2020-11-05 14:11:40 <@252286793662070784> hey that's a nice plane. Too bad it seems too dangerous. No pilot could ever fly that. ;)
creations-chat 2020-11-05 14:18:55 Agreed
It and the wind rises are my 2 favorite studio ghibli movies.. which might be why the CA 3 CA 90 and Ki 20/G 38 are my favorite aircraft
creations-chat 2020-11-05 14:21:11 Yeah. The airship's of howl's moving castle are also absolutely amazing
creations-chat 2020-11-05 14:22:58 And the weird dragonfly fliers that occour with variety in both Howl's moving castle and castle in the sky (which also has a bad ass massive airship)

I really want to build the castle at some point
creations-chat 2020-11-05 14:25:55 I built porcos plane a while ago but it was when I first started playing and was really bad.. I might re make it as well as the dream winged plane in the intro to the wind rises.
creations-chat 2020-11-05 14:29:46 Oh god this is going to be so not fun
creations-chat 2020-11-05 14:38:43 They aren't really that bad.. I mean they are pretty easy to avoid or destroy...? I think they are way too hated on.. when they aren't any worse then suicide blocks or any other noob weopon...
creations-chat 2020-11-05 14:40:28 I'm FTM not MTF thankyou
creations-chat 2020-11-06 09:44:44 anyone have a good heavy lift heli that can carry a glider via small hook? if so can you meet me in VIP 1 i really wanna test this
creations-chat 2020-11-06 09:46:51 Really?
creations-chat 2020-11-06 09:48:25 That's pretty fucking stupid... I mean it can fly on its own so it's not that bad but like.. I can't use it as intended now
creations-chat 2020-11-06 09:52:10 I still think this thing is pretty cool.. it carries a kettenkrad a Gollioth and a trailer to carry the Gollioth behind the kettenkrad and these all can be deployed several different ways
creations-chat 2020-11-06 09:58:34 Try what
creations-chat 2020-11-06 14:34:10 The main turret exterior isn't fully detailed yet so it is a pretty big contrast your right. I'm working on it tho x3
creations-chat 2020-11-06 14:42:53 Thanks! <@739268362420355134>
creations-chat 2020-11-06 14:46:41 This is why I don't build sleek planes
When I do build flying shit it's gliders and bi planes that can look janky as fuck
creations-chat 2020-11-06 14:49:24 I want to make this plane but holy fuck these wings are scary

It's a plane from the beginning of the studio ghibli flim "the wind rises"
It's from a dream
creations-chat 2020-11-06 16:22:06 Danm
Okay you can't see it in the screenshots because I'm stupid
But the ratte turret has a plate over where the 3rd gun was originally on the battleship turret.
creations-chat 2020-11-06 16:25:00 Especially when they take the form of rocket spammi g fighter jets who get bored of air battle and so spawn kill ground units while claiming it's not rocket spam because fighter jets do have that many rockets.. even though fighter jets.. don't engage tanks..
creations-chat 2020-11-07 03:53:42 I'm scared
help 2020-11-07 10:04:03 How do you make the German iorn cross with text. I've seen people do it so how do you
help 2020-11-07 10:06:57 Either
help 2020-11-07 10:07:01 Both
creations-chat 2020-11-07 10:10:38 I think you can post WIPs as long as there is significant progress
Like my ratte is still a WIP but I've posted it several times so I can get an idea of how it looks and what to do next
help 2020-11-07 10:13:37 Thankyou
creations-chat 2020-11-07 10:14:35 I would post WIPs here but this chat is so frequently full of bullshit they get drowned out

<@627813759427018752> it looks really good. I would suggest adding cobblestone for a frame of the building though
creations-chat 2020-11-07 12:59:59 kettenkrad go brr

And I ligit only play plane crazy

How do you upload music to get music codes for it.. I can't find what I need in the store

How do you make the music codes
I can't find what I want in the library
bot-central 2020-11-07 15:12:14 !expertservers
creations-chat 2020-11-07 16:13:46 So I originally had a half track that sat in my vehicle bay but it took up too much space it was hard to close the ramp with it in it.
So I made this kettenkrad and well
It actually takes up too little space
The bay could probably fit 2 of them although that would be redundent. What else should I add? Maybe a Gollioth tracked mine?

(Screenshot is pretty deceptive
I'm actually standing at the half way point in the vehicle bay)
creations-chat 2020-11-07 16:15:50 I originally planned too have a shelf containing 3 that I could then launch but the half track was so big I took it out. I could re add it but I wanted to know if anyone had any more intresting ideas
creations-chat 2020-11-07 16:19:46 That's.. not possible
The way the vehicle bay opens it would either need to take off facing down or would need to move out of the bay around the kettenkrad then take off.. that would need me to be on flat ground too though
I have toyed with the idea of creating a varient of my ratte with either a heli pad on the back of the gun or a runway above the ~~engine~~ vehicle bay where a scout plane would be.
creations-chat 2020-11-07 16:21:49 Also it just occurred to me I am talking to the seemingly official P1000RatteMechanic and he hasn't called my build streaming hot garbage yet
 The ratte gods have granted there approval.
creations-chat 2020-11-07 16:25:05 I also want to add the karl gerrat seidge mortor onto the back engine compartment but that might clutter it ***Too much***
creations-chat 2020-11-08 06:52:35 Hey so what's this nub on this turret
I want too know if it has a function I need to replicate or I'd it should be left for decoration.
creations-chat 2020-11-08 14:43:04 This guy jumped onto my ratte and it took me way too long to realize what he was wearing and doing and so I stopped 
Got in my kettenkrad opened the vehicle bay door and put the ratte full speed into the void while pulling out on my kettenkrad
creations-chat 2020-11-08 14:45:11 I was like "Fuck akward I don't know what this guy is doing I just wanted to build big tank please stop ree"
creations-chat 2020-11-08 14:46:44 The monster isn't a tank it's a SPG varient of the ratte.
But yes I do intend on making it at some point whenever I finnish this
creations-chat 2020-11-08 14:51:04 The gun is bigger but I wouldn't really say it looks better... Because we don't have any idea what it would have looked like like at all
The guy proposing the ratte supposedly mentioned how they could put the gustav gun on it for a  SPG and that's pretty much all we know.
creations-chat 2020-11-08 14:53:44 Depends what you want to achieve with it
creations-chat 2020-11-08 14:57:33 Planes are gay
Powered gliders are where it's at
creations-chat 2020-11-08 15:06:02 Me hiding in the spawn ditch from the shredder swarm be like:
creations-chat 2020-11-09 11:58:42 I need a color code for a good sexy soviet green
creations-chat 2020-11-09 12:05:10 thoinks
creations-chat 2020-11-09 21:11:56 <@659802570474258500> hey so I know your working on the T 35
It's my favorite tank and so I want to start working on one as well as I've (significantly atleast) finished my ratte. It's obviously not going to be a copy or anything but one in my build style much closer to scale
What I would like too ask though is if you'd like to share how you are going to do the horseshoe entena because it's kinda stumping me..
creations-chat 2020-11-09 21:21:12 He wasn't crying he's asking for proper feedback which a symbol arrow doesn't exactly provide
creations-chat 2020-11-09 22:07:56 <@659802570474258500> mine is much smaller and much less complex with alot less motor lock then yours
I just need help for the entena
creations-chat 2020-11-09 23:06:47 T 35 is cooler then the maus change my mind
creations-chat 2020-11-09 23:17:06 This is my go too for size with tanks
I don't like making giant tanks but as compact and close to size as I can without it being a tiny little prop.

Thought I would post it here
creations-chat 2020-11-09 23:21:28 <@659802570474258500> it's not super derailed yet but I'll work on it more tommorow
creations-chat 2020-11-09 23:23:56 I mean
I had a build stolen from me and made into a tutorial
Now whenever I use my mini sub I have to explain that it's not a tutorial. The guy who made the tutorial is a petty theif and I am Infact out for blood
creations-chat 2020-11-09 23:25:34 Also holy shit my ratte got 50 danm upvotes

Guess I'll make a proper showcase of it
creations-chat 2020-11-09 23:27:56 I'm currently on mobile.. just search my messages in creations..
creations-chat 2020-11-09 23:37:43 I still can't do complex motor lock because my DID (I will disassociate and not being able to recognize what I was doing easily give up on it) which sucks..
creations-chat 2020-11-09 23:41:10 I'm gonna get banned for little to no motor lock on my most complex builds dispite understanding how motor lock works
creations-chat 2020-11-09 23:43:06 Is there an actual reason they add the swirl in plain engines because it feels like it might be just to amuse me like a "woosh engine soon and go brrrrr "
creations-chat 2020-11-09 23:47:02 When I finnish the T 35 I am going to work on lil baby tankette
I'm tired of big tonks
creations-chat 2020-11-09 23:48:33 I really liked making the kettenkrad 
I wanna make more smoll things
creations-chat 2020-11-09 23:51:16 Guns
creations-chat 2020-11-10 09:56:07 Still needs alot of work
creations-chat 2020-11-10 14:19:49 Bro imagine putting a vehicle bay on a build like wth
creations-chat 2020-11-10 14:22:53 not that I'd know anything about pointless vehicle bays tho.. of course not
creations-chat 2020-11-10 14:24:39 No the kettenkrad could get down fine on its own
creations-chat 2020-11-10 14:26:19 
creations-chat 2020-11-10 14:32:50 Thanks
creations-chat 2020-11-10 15:21:17 I don't really mind shredder bugs
Generally it's jets I don't like
Like you have a fighter jet with 8 rockets attacking my ww2 tank at speeds faster then my computer can handle and this somehow isn't rocket spam
creations-chat 2020-11-10 15:25:13 I build tanks
My tanks are amazing against other tanks so long as they aren't spamming 12 rockets a time
But of course my interwar tank is the perfect target for a modern fighter jet.
Fighters don't use there 12 rockets against interwar tanks
You doing so is still rocket spam even if it dose have that many rockets
creations-chat 2020-11-10 15:27:44 Yeah no
All of my most upvoted stuff are useless in pvp..
But all my pvp tanks get hella downvoted because they aren't motor locked too hell and back and have decent weopons and armor
creations-chat 2020-11-10 15:29:38 I love those rocket cars
When noobs take a tiny tutorial race car and plant all the woepons they can

I have 3 diffrent versions of the teliporting half track specifically to destroy those
They are so fun to tear apart
Sames with block tanks and shredders
creations-chat 2020-11-10 15:31:30 The Teliportation bug is my favorite in pvp
Like ligit it's so good against all the spam if you put it on a small fast tank
creations-chat 2020-11-10 19:28:33 <@294980570885390346> I have them on all my German tanks and for some reason it's only with my ratte where people go "hey that symbol is racist your a na**" even when I explain that's not what the iorn cross means..
creations-chat 2020-11-10 19:41:29 How the hell do people do the thing where they put sparklers back to back for a gun barrel??
creations-chat 2020-11-10 21:35:47 
creations-chat 2020-11-10 23:26:10 The slow mode has worked amazingly. Once people stop complaining about it over time it will become clear how well it is working.
creations-chat 2020-11-10 23:28:56 How should I go about adding details like rivits to the sprocket covers
creations-chat 2020-11-10 23:31:35 ^^^
creations-chat 2020-11-10 23:33:18 It's really funny all the people who complain about slow mode are the same people who trashed the chat before we had it
creations-chat 2020-11-11 08:11:40 Hol up
There is a hammer and sickle on this tonk
creations-chat 2020-11-11 08:18:56 *no it was a German tank*
creations-chat 2020-11-11 10:00:49 <@414359638302130176> um no.. I looked it up and that's wrong
Especially because that photo was taken before the Russians captured it
The germans painted it on so if the allies saw it they would assume it was a captured russian tank not a German project
creations-chat 2020-11-11 10:52:38 Apparently I'm a noob because "real tanks don't have a million gun turrets you spammer"

He was talking about my T 35
creations-chat 2020-11-11 10:55:10 
creations-chat 2020-11-11 10:57:41 "tanks only have one turret" 

The entire interwar period: "am I a joke to you?"
creations-chat 2020-11-11 10:59:13 Ww2 SPGs:
You guys have armor?
creations-chat 2020-11-11 11:00:58 Imagine being a female mark one
That's why I'm trans FTM
Not because of dysphoria no
Because female mark ones are hella gay
creations-chat 2020-11-11 11:32:29 I mean
It was game changing at the time
Ww1-interwar tanks are ligit my favorite
creations-chat 2020-11-11 11:39:48 So I was thinking
The issue with pvp is it favors small builds with alot of guns right?
Big builds get the same amount of guns as those small builds and can't defend themselves due to it
And they can't have more gun cus then more would just be placed on the spam build

So why not add more powerfull gun types
But make them add alot of weight to your build
For the large builds they are meant for this would be no problem easy peasy but for small spam boxes there things can't be spammed on them as easily
creations-chat 2020-11-11 12:08:38 It stops people from making small planes or cars with the new guns
Helium takes up space still 
It's not big spam cars that are the issue they are easy to pick off
creations-chat 2020-11-11 13:47:58 What in ze fek is that maus
The maus is like
The easiest tank to get right how do you mess it up?
creations-chat 2020-11-11 14:50:08 Is.. that supposed to be a ratte?

I'ma have to revoke this man's breathing rights if that's what it's supposed to be
creations-chat 2020-11-11 21:21:57 This mf goin  goin on about how my ratte is too short and small. bish at least my tank doesn't look like a frozen block of green pea soup
creations-chat 2020-11-11 21:46:52 My ratte is intentionally not supposed to look like that and be more stubby 
(I kinda hate sleek looking tanks from a esthetic standpoint
It just kinda misses the point in my mind and the ratte looks so sleek whenever it's depicted. I hate the maus for the same reason)
It's my interpretation of the ratte concept
creations-chat 2020-11-11 21:49:55 I wanted it too look less like the maus and more like something you'd see in metal slug
Thus more bulky
creations-chat 2020-11-11 21:51:54 I'ma try making this
My first tank was actually an AAV
And I recently refitted it while keeping the same old esthetic.
I want to make a new one tho
creations-chat 2020-11-12 01:37:08 My new AAV. Not detailed yet but all the hard parts are done ^-^
creations-chat 2020-11-12 01:38:41 It's all the different hatches and shit
creations-chat 2020-11-12 02:08:27 I'm happy with the turret just not the gun and again currently there are no details on it including paint
creations-chat 2020-11-12 02:30:41 Can someone design an AAV turret for me.. I know that sounds lazy.. it's not.. I'm not good at turrets and I think I know how to do it but it would take alot of motor lock because as I've mentioned before I can't do complex motor lock stuff because when I switch alters or disassociate from my DID I completely lose track of what I'm doing and have to re look over the entire thing to figure out what I'm doing... 

Holy shit I've seen that purple car he tried to talk shit on my T 35
creations-chat 2020-11-12 02:32:14 It's a bit more then just 2 motor 2s..
creations-chat 2020-11-12 02:33:45 That looks amazing thankyou.. I might play with it a bit as mine doesn't have the garnade launcher but just a large machine gun and more storage space
creations-chat 2020-11-12 02:35:36 <@674434894616854548> yeah but it has windows and shit and the gun fits in weird
creations-chat 2020-11-12 02:37:10 It's not a tank it's an AAV or basiclly a water proof IFV
creations-chat 2020-11-12 02:45:36 Wait it has a name.. I assumed it was just called an AAV.. america likes to name a single vehicle for what it's classification is
America is weird
creations-chat 2020-11-12 02:48:38 I've only ever heard them called AAVs and  names like that for the varients
creations-chat 2020-11-12 02:50:13 What is it?
creations-chat 2020-11-12 14:02:14 I am pretty happy with how the outside of this is looking
creations-chat 2020-11-12 17:25:53 I wanna make 3 versions of the AAV
This is the standerd version
I'll do the command version and the super heavy lift engineering version with a crain
creations-chat 2020-11-12 18:12:43 Any feedback for my AAV?
creations-chat 2020-11-12 18:16:39 That's.. kinda the point of camouflage isn't it?
creations-chat 2020-11-12 18:18:13 That's fair
It's easier too see them all in game tbf
creations-chat 2020-11-12 18:37:18 That jet thing is radiculois
I love it
creations-chat 2020-11-12 20:24:17 I can't use WASD on planes easily due to my tics (I have tourretes though not severe it makes doing stuff on keyboards not fun)
creations-chat 2020-11-12 20:28:54 They're missing the tacks. *Ba dum ting*
creations-chat 2020-11-12 20:30:37 *I'm sorry for that. Bad joke is bad.*
creations-chat 2020-11-12 20:38:40 Yeah I'ma delete that- time too do some trimmin
creations-chat 2020-11-13 01:04:51 I've spent the last 20mins afking while spinning in place in my AAV to polkka
creations-chat 2020-11-13 01:14:55 What the fuck.
This has more upvotes then some decent builds
It's a single danm block pull your shit together.

creations-chat 2020-11-13 03:18:16 Also <@320552571360247808> may I suggest using 0.9 blocks for the path rather then disconnectors for the path

creations-chat 2020-11-13 03:31:25 Sometimes you need opinions on WIPs.. and you can't normally post it here and expect large response because this chat likes to get shit faced
creations-chat 2020-11-13 03:32:56 That doesn't help.
It was worse before the slow mode.
creations-chat 2020-11-13 03:38:31 Holy shit
This man posted a series of wips then did the same thing on a new different build
creations-chat 2020-11-13 03:40:01 *I'm so confused as to how people do those they look so good.*
creations-chat 2020-11-13 03:41:56 Why does this have so many upvotes..


Ooo
Okay
Is it alright if I save that to try to do something like it?..
creations-chat 2020-11-13 03:45:18 For just playing a few months.. my first tank (an AAV) and this new AAV.. there is clear progress...
creations-chat 2020-11-13 03:46:52 No they're completely different builds
The first Is my first tank 
The second is my new one
It's like twice the size has interior and us better in ligit every way
creations-chat 2020-11-13 03:49:06 *looks up from drawing tablet*
creations-chat 2020-11-13 03:51:42 Aww..
Can I hug it?
creations-chat 2020-11-13 03:54:12 I use light mode because I wear glasses but mine don't work while looking at screens so my vision looking at a phone is shit
Light mode has higher contrast
creations-chat 2020-11-13 03:56:22 I feel like the back needs improvement but idk how to do that when I have the ramp..
creations-chat 2020-11-13 03:58:29 Well
No
The problem really is

Is it's accurate
All the details on the back of the actual AAV
Are there

It still feels empty because irl it is.. and idk how to fix it
creations-chat 2020-11-13 18:36:11 Wow my new ratte turret got a lot of downvotes what do I need to fix on it
creations-chat 2020-11-13 18:50:19 Can I get some detailed feedback on my new ratte turret? It got hella downvoted and I'm not really sure what to fix..
creations-chat 2020-11-13 18:58:04 But.. I stated why it was a WIP..? I wanted too see feedback on the shape
Can't post it here and expect feedback because shit gets buried under monkeys screaming about self upvotes
creations-chat 2020-11-13 22:45:51 This 
But

creations-chat 2020-11-13 23:03:09 Yeah it looks pretty wack ngl
creations-chat 2020-11-13 23:12:11 This image gets more cursed the closer you look at it
help 2020-11-13 23:22:48 So does motor 2 just not like massive turrets?
creations-chat 2020-11-13 23:47:27 Torpedo boat with tank treads? How about:
creations-chat 2020-11-14 03:02:02 I need a sound effect to loop for my ratte's engines
I had one but it gave me head aches for some reason
creations-chat 2020-11-14 12:59:19 
creations-chat 2020-11-14 13:03:21 I didn't know this but apparently germany made so many gollioths that after the war they just had too mass junk them in big piles the blow them up with C4 like wtf
creations-chat 2020-11-14 13:06:10 They were tracked mines and tbf they did have a lot of issues
creations-chat 2020-11-14 14:25:55 What the hell
creations-chat 2020-11-14 14:29:36 If I built this in game without giving the context of it being a weasel
I would be considered a noob
creations-chat 2020-11-14 15:08:18 And very few were used
creations-chat 2020-11-14 23:08:37 <@265819387498332160> hey I have one just like that but it's a 2 seater/stores stuff thing
creations-chat 2020-11-14 23:27:32 That moment when you make a SPG so big it extends over 3 plots and moving the gun to fast flips it over
(Making the monster)
creations-chat 2020-11-15 03:50:14 Why thankyou.
creations-chat 2020-11-15 03:52:56 Indeed
I was enjoying your half tracks
They are my favorite vehicles of all time
creations-chat 2020-11-15 03:55:41 I'm kinda unhappy with the gun so that might change at some point
creations-chat 2020-11-15 03:57:42 Thanks
creations-chat 2020-11-15 03:59:19 I'm bad at guns
So I think it's pretty good for me being terrible at guns but not the best anyone could make
I will likely re do the end of the berral at some point
creations-chat 2020-11-15 04:01:20 I'm waiting for the inevitable downvote for "unrealisticness that my og "pree dreadnaught" ratte got
creations-chat 2020-11-15 04:02:53 Yeah
creations-chat 2020-11-15 04:27:24 I've never seen someone do a ratte or monster with the seams in the armor like this so I'm pretty proud of them especially because they use so little motor lock and sit so seamlessly into the hull
creations-chat 2020-11-15 04:29:25 It doesn't need to be longer and wouldn't of been longer it was proposed as a SPG varient of the ratte?
creations-chat 2020-11-15 04:49:11 You mean the ikea jets?
creations-chat 2020-11-15 05:21:03 Isn't there a bigger but fictonal German tank? If so should I make it given I've done the ratte and monster?
creations-chat 2020-11-15 05:23:01 Holy shit.. is.. is this even possible in game?
creations-chat 2020-11-15 05:24:47 At the scale of my other ratte?
I don't even know what I would do with all that space
Or all of the interior
How I would connect the interiors of the 4 ratte bodies too the main tank
My plot can barely fit 2 rattes I don't think I could do 4 and a tank
creations-chat 2020-11-15 05:27:17 Maybe it could be done using 3 accounts
2 for the ratte's
One for the main tank body
But
Is it even worth it at that point? It probably wouldn't even get hall of fame as there is no way I could come up with all that interior
creations-chat 2020-11-15 05:41:49 If doing this thing thing with as much detail and interior and what not as my ratte doesn't get me hall of fame
I don't know what will
help 2020-11-15 05:46:32 Is connecting builds between alts possible
Not counting controls or anything but if I hook mine and my alts half of a build together will they stay hooked or will physics fuck itself
help 2020-11-15 05:48:19 I have good internet
I need a good grappling design
I'm going to try to build the Grott which will take somewhere between 3 and 4 different accounts to make
help 2020-11-15 05:51:26 My ratte takes up half my plot
This has 4 plus a whole nother tank body plus a gun the size of a ratte
help 2020-11-15 06:23:40 My estimate is 3 -4 because it needs to be to scale with my current ratte so I can do interior
creations-chat 2020-11-15 15:47:48 I edited a bit too make it look like the gun was still hot from just firing a shot
creations-chat 2020-11-15 18:48:53 I'm working on my monsters steering 
Basiclly giving it 2 modes
Drive mode and a targeting mode
Meaning I can switch modes, stop in place via anchor blocks and then my kepad acts as in place steering turning the whole thing while I aim the gun
It's still usless in pvp but it's incredibly fun to use

creations-chat 2020-11-16 00:29:39 I found a server full of loonys

creations-chat 2020-11-16 03:32:47 He dosen't know how to motor lock so the panels at he side stick out
creations-chat 2020-11-16 03:34:37 Nah
I'm enjoying watching him butcher my build
creations-chat 2020-11-16 03:36:59 LOL
creations-chat 2020-11-16 03:43:27 
creations-chat 2020-11-16 03:44:58 "I'm using 1 motor lock instead of 3"
Yeah but you seem to have forgotten that you will have to fit wheels under that..
creations-chat 2020-11-16 03:47:41 He has no idea what goes above that point as evidenced by the fact he started the second deck way too low
He also dispite him apparently making it more accurately to the irl tank can't name what he actually improved or name the tank in question
creations-chat 2020-11-16 03:50:50 I'm just going to say it because it needs to be said just once
*It's not called a ram it's called a bulbous bow reee*

creations-chat 2020-11-16 04:38:15 I have a very similar one irl but it's 12 ft and has space to carry some stuff
creations-chat 2020-11-16 04:54:27 No way that gets HOF while my ratte, the most detailed one I've seen in creations doesn't..
creations-chat 2020-11-16 08:13:55 Dude I am so close to 60 upvotes on my ratte-
*Fricking hype*
creations-chat 2020-11-16 08:18:29 You think it will make it in?
creations-chat 2020-11-16 08:23:10 Hopefully by the time I wake up people have voted up to 60 and I can submit it to hall of fame.. however you do that..
creations-chat 2020-11-16 08:24:53 Wdym?
creations-chat 2020-11-16 08:26:40 ^
creations-chat 2020-11-16 08:31:55 I mean
If it doesn't make hall of fame I'll ask for some hard feedback and criticism then strip it down again and re do it with that in mind just like I did the last 2 times
creations-chat 2020-11-16 08:35:16 What battleship?
creations-chat 2020-11-16 08:38:31 I would pick another ship of it's classification and try to go from there improvising where needed
creations-chat 2020-11-16 08:42:03 Holy hell these blueprints make no sense.. that's absolutely massive wth
creations-chat 2020-11-16 08:43:46 Yeah 
I built one
It's in creations

I mean this is too big for the ratte.
Way too big
Well.. no maybe not.. the layout would just be.. incredibly sloped..
creations-chat 2020-11-16 08:46:17 Yeah but these blueprints don't make sense with how it's proportioned
Yourd end up with a tall sleek front and vack rectangle of a tank..
creations-chat 2020-11-16 08:47:49 Wdym? <@456226577798135808>
creations-chat 2020-11-16 08:49:20 Ah alright
creations-chat 2020-11-16 08:51:57 Stop shitting on WIPs in creations they are valid if you need general opinions on something before adding say the turret or wings
Also from personal experience it's way better to get a response there then here
creations-chat 2020-11-16 08:53:36 The front one is yeah
creations-chat 2020-11-16 08:56:12 Yeah but creations feedback frequently gives no feedback
It's more often full of idiots spamming the same emote or screeming about a tutorial
creations-chat 2020-11-16 17:40:19 Danm
Still stuck at 55 votes on the ratte
creations-chat 2020-11-16 17:41:50 Hi can people please pass judgement on my ratte I wanna get it into hall of fame and am 5 away
creations-chat 2020-11-16 17:46:38 Just search 'ratte' in **creations** it's like the 3rd one up-

I SAID THE WRONG THING
creations-chat 2020-11-16 17:48:35 Not HOf
Creations
I fucked up said the wrong thing reee
I'm trying to get it in hall of fame
creations-chat 2020-11-16 17:54:25 <@456226577798135808> then I'll just ask and then take feedback and strip it down re work it from the bottom up with it in mind again like I did the first 2 times until I get it right
creations-chat 2020-11-16 18:02:26 I wanna build one of these fucking things

creations-chat 2020-11-16 18:33:15 Welp
It's not going past 59 upvotes
I'ma start work on stripping it down to make a better one
creations-chat 2020-11-16 19:38:53 1moreree
creations-chat 2020-11-16 19:44:21 I understand motor lock well my problem isn't really one that can be fixed 
I'm a DID system and every time I've tried to work on projects that use a lot of motor lock I disassociate and end up confused about how what I was building works and then try to"fix it" and it just gets worse from there
So I can't do really complex motor lock
Only small amounts of it for stuff like my rattes side pannels or for turrets
creations-chat 2020-11-16 19:55:08 Holy shit
The guy who was copying my ratte last night is still trying
creations-chat 2020-11-16 19:57:44 It's a pretty bad copy as well
creations-chat 2020-11-16 20:18:40 So I parked my blimp above him with the sign saying COPY \/

AND HE FUCKING LEFT
creations-chat 2020-11-16 20:21:52 Also I was right in guessing he didn't remember much above the main deck because he butchered the gun house
creations-chat 2020-11-16 20:37:29 <@746022074216218625> can I commit joke steel and create a furry ratte
creations-chat 2020-11-16 20:45:27 Which one?
creations-chat 2020-11-16 20:57:10 It's hard too someone who blacks out every couple minutes and has foggy memory of what they were doing at the best of times
creations-chat 2020-11-16 21:07:26 Hell yeah I am
creations-chat 2020-11-16 21:10:14 I mean
Really I'm ace but I'm pan romantic
creations-chat 2020-11-16 21:31:23 I hate how war thunders (IE the mod) ratte looks 
The gun is too far back
The armor wouldn't of been that danm sleek
It wasn't the maus
creations-chat 2020-11-16 21:35:14 Yeah but it's the most popular one and its what people tend to think of and it fucking bugs me
creations-chat 2020-11-16 21:38:05 Yeah but there was a single Blueprint
And it doesn't have the front that stupidly sloped or the gun that far back on the body
People say my ratte is short or stubby
No it's accurate to the original blueprints as much as possible
creations-chat 2020-11-16 21:42:48 Except they do.. they have an accurate shape and main gun
The details are what we don't know
And it is incredibly unlikely the front looked like that
Just as unlikely as there being 2 maus turrets on the back
Also the gun being in the middle like that would make the entire thing back heavy
creations-chat 2020-11-16 21:51:01 <@207922337549385728> no but we know what parts of the design looks like and we know enough to know that's not what it would look like
creations-chat 2020-11-16 22:43:43 took me like 2 mins t figure out "wait there are 2 kettenkrads there-"
creations-chat 2020-11-16 22:46:48 I mean
At least the guy isn't copying the ratte itself
Just my lil kettenkrad
creations-chat 2020-11-17 00:57:53 UwU~
creations-chat 2020-11-17 01:00:53 *Evil mustache man sighing with his face in his hands:* It was bound to happen.
creations-chat 2020-11-17 01:05:13 <@342402058994974730> wait do you build bikes? Do you have a compact design.. I still am looking for a second vehicle to put in my ratte's vehicle bay..
creations-chat 2020-11-17 01:07:04 It needs to be fairly small tho
Like under 4 blocks tall
creations-chat 2020-11-17 01:08:40 I can't to complex motor lock builds I've explained before
My DID makes it really hard to keep track of complex motor lock as I'm working on it
creations-chat 2020-11-17 01:10:32 Please do it.

dude I had to leave the server I was in after doing that it was too much to stay
creations-chat 2020-11-17 01:17:22 the neko ratte will rise from the depths and eat your boat like a kraken

so does it
creations-chat 2020-11-17 01:19:17 well first you must sacrifice your newborn to the plane crazy physics gods-
creations-chat 2020-11-17 01:27:24 The boosters in the back are a bit odd

creations-chat 2020-11-17 23:49:02 I'm making a German zeppelin
But I wanna make a military one not a civilian one
Any suggestions?
creations-chat 2020-11-18 00:18:19 I found the post of my original ratte.. and it's so cringy..
creations-chat 2020-11-18 01:42:25 wdyt so far
creations-chat 2020-11-18 01:46:16 Its not the hindenburg it's a much older style but custom zeppelin.. and yeah it's supposed to be pretty long
creations-chat 2020-11-18 01:54:05 Yea
creations-chat 2020-11-18 05:11:28 What the f-
creations-chat 2020-11-18 05:16:49 wdyt of the first cabin?
creations-chat 2020-11-18 05:19:52 <@660019099430289418> yee 
I'm basing it off this one zeppelin I found with 2 cabins and a bomb bay between them
creations-chat 2020-11-18 05:35:38 <@661877568408125480> it looks good
I suggest using trails (set them off of toggle and to a key you won't press)
To create better runway markings
You can look them up or copy the runway in game for an idea
creations-chat 2020-11-18 05:37:09 Um.. no not at all
I've been trying to figure that out..
creations-chat 2020-11-18 05:39:40 Yeah but they sre pretty obviously new to the game.. you can't be too hard on them that's how you make them not want to play
You guys do this way too often

creations-chat 2020-11-19 04:52:57 *just wait with context what your looking at will make sense*
creations-chat 2020-11-19 04:55:53 I present
The most obscure but honestly one of the coolest peices of airship related technology
creations-chat 2020-11-19 04:58:40 Right? It's pretty brilliant 
It was completely real
I think it's a neat idea and even though we don't have clouds in PC I have added one

It's one of those parts of ww1 airship warfare that is largelyand sadly forgotten. Airship's have been around for a while and they are hella intresting

***it wasn't just germany***
creations-chat 2020-11-19 05:03:44 so here is the zoom out
creations-chat 2020-11-19 05:10:51 Well yeah it's not detailed or painted yet
But functionally it's all there
This thing is huge and it's stats as of now are pretty impressive..
It has 2 5 gun machine gun turrets for a full 360 dagrees of coverage
Has 2 bar racks (they were taken off in that screenshot) that can theoretically carry whatever I want the save has 50 single block bombs but theoretically I can increase the number of bars on the rack and add all 150 bombs
Or I could add rocket turrets, guided missiles or even tanks

It also has 2 internal bomb bays for exploasive spheres one of which currently houses the spy basket but can be fitted too carry bombs as well as the second bay for a total of 150
creations-chat 2020-11-19 05:12:28 2

5 gun

Machine gun turrets
2 turrets
Each side
With 5 guns
creations-chat 2020-11-19 05:14:31 Yeah I recognize that now-
Sorry for the confusion
creations-chat 2020-11-19 05:17:59 It's kinda sad.. it isn't really possible to build massive scale airships in hame.. because they are fucking huge.. and unlike a ship where you can cut off half of it.. you see all of the airship..
creations-chat 2020-11-19 08:36:39 I was going to push the final "WiP" with all the details and what not of my zeppelin before I went too add the helium. 


And now I'm going to wait until it won't be overshadowed by the far more impressive steampunk build-
creations-chat 2020-11-19 08:48:09 Ah so like
Scrap punk
creations-chat 2020-11-19 08:49:52 
creations-chat 2020-11-19 08:58:59 mine is supposed to just be accurate  to ww1 zepplins..
creations-chat 2020-11-19 09:22:03 <@291956715749113868> that's not an anchor it's a spy basket I just lowered myself in to get down
creations-chat 2020-11-19 09:24:18 They were actually a used and in my opinion are one of the cooler parts if what make up the forgotten airship's of warfare
creations-chat 2020-11-19 09:29:14 Also 
For anchoring an airship using teathers and anchor blocks
The best way to do it is to replicate real life


Lower feather with anchor off the nose of the ship once that teather is on the ground cut power to the engines and let the airship tilt tail to nose 90 dagrees.
Once this is done lower a second teather from the tail and once that is anchored on the ground you can real it in too bring your airship to an even level before reeling in both ropes to bring it to the ground.
creations-chat 2020-11-19 09:41:37 How.. the hell.. is it that big.. I only was able to do a 3 fold because the engines and tail took up so much space... And the gondolas.. mine has pvp use tho
creations-chat 2020-11-19 09:51:19 I will also be undergroing this expedition in my own ship to provide scientific consensus on <@291956715749113868>'s findings.
creations-chat 2020-11-19 09:58:05 Brining some experiments on board to test
A conveyor engine, 2 different Teliportation drives, some different engines some weopons and other mechanical peices to test
creations-chat 2020-11-19 10:03:09 
creations-chat 2020-11-19 10:15:03 my max speed going down is 90.. it is 225 to 300 with the other 2 engines on each side I stupidly took off while doing the gondolas and forgot to put back on
creations-chat 2020-11-19 10:18:05 danm... so either you reached an end in that time.. and so I don't have much further or something else happened. I am pretty far out and all my instruments and experiments are still working normally.
creations-chat 2020-11-19 10:23:06 
creations-chat 2020-11-19 10:24:46 Fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck
creations-chat 2020-11-19 10:26:30 I went to raise myself back up into the airship
And 
Accidentally unanchored it and came very close to the void
creations-chat 2020-11-19 23:35:05 Anyone have a good design for a small lil search light? I wanna fit some on my zeppelin
creations-chat 2020-11-19 23:52:14 So I was working on my airship
And guy joins private server and goes "can I shoot it down please? And then won't shut up about it
So I'm like
Yeah you can let me spawn it in I get it's pretty epic to use old planes to shoot down zeppel- motherfucker pulls out a guided missile in a seat
And runs it into me
Then does it again
And again
And so I go "danm.. that was disappointing I thought you were going to pull out a plane or something.."
He then goes "wow dude I'm leaving"

Like bruh


Then he just now joins back and goes "I'm not a noob I have premium I have a turret now you happy?"
creations-chat 2020-11-19 23:53:53 Yep


I have no idea who this person is or how they got in my VIP server
creations-chat 2020-11-19 23:56:06 I guess
Again I have no issue with the fact I was shot down
It's the fact he did it in the most.. boring way possible
help 2020-11-20 02:09:21 I don't understand what happened the motors all stopped working they fall apart

creations-chat 2020-11-20 02:16:17 I think I'm going to fucking cry
My airship is literally falling apart and I don't know if I added something or what's going on
The folding dosent work
Blocks are missing from it in the save
And the 4 engines don't respond to controls
bot-central 2020-11-20 02:27:49 !servers
creations-chat 2020-11-20 06:16:10 That looks hella good
creations-chat 2020-11-20 09:31:22 I am very quickly running out of rooms to put in my airship
creations-chat 2020-11-20 10:02:18 Yeah early ones only had interior withen the gondolas
And I was going to do that
But mine is big enough that I could fit decks into the bottom similar to later airships with cabins built into the envelope.
creations-chat 2020-11-20 11:57:49 Airship don
No
B deal
Been working on this 3 days no sleep tho
So I can finally sleep
creations-chat 2020-11-20 12:00:20 Ok wait

creations-chat 2020-11-23 05:08:55 Think I can make a mouse controlled blimp?
creations-chat 2020-11-23 05:28:45 THAT WAS THE WRONG CHAT-
creations-chat 2020-11-23 05:30:41 I think it's some BS I cannot get any ranks for this
creations-chat 2020-11-23 05:40:55 what on it doesn't look good?
creations-chat 2020-11-23 05:44:40 <@456226577798135808> what on it doesn't look that good?
creations-chat 2020-11-23 05:46:45 It's gondolas have alot of detail.. airships don't have alot of details on the envelope and the one I was going for was long and thin like that
creations-chat 2020-11-23 05:52:17 so basically make a new airship. got it
creations-chat 2020-11-23 05:54:29 Yeah but making it shorter means re building and re adjusting it's weight, it's interior and it's controls
I'll re paint it
creations-chat 2020-11-23 05:56:50 that would mean moving the front gondola back and complete restructuring of how the bottom is layed out.
creations-chat 2020-11-23 05:58:29 all of the bomb strips bomb bays and equipment out the bottom is from the front gondola back
creations-chat 2020-11-23 06:00:24 either way it is practically re building half of it. when I posted the frame of this people said it looked good. i filled in that frame and now it's shit
creations-chat 2020-11-23 06:02:34 i showed that i wanted to make a big airship with 2 gondolas and showed this and the frame
creations-chat 2020-11-23 06:08:19 It's proportioned to look like this
It's not supposed to be an exact recreation of any zeppelin mainly because I can't find good blueprints for any of these.
I can re paint it
But I don't see a reason to move the tail comparing them it looks fine
creations-chat 2020-11-23 06:15:48 What
creations-chat 2020-11-23 06:20:12 I can't yet
I need it for a group thing

creations-chat 2020-11-23 10:15:50 For a split second it didn't give my post an upvote button and I was like "bish excuse me?"

I wanna make a smoll blimp
creations-chat 2020-11-23 16:31:13 I mean..
creations-chat 2020-11-23 16:33:11 Also <@539537860215439360> reminds me of the Stanley parable
creations-chat 2020-11-23 16:44:29 <@626449107577471012> the cat sounds weren't even distrorted his cat just made them wack ass noises whenever it was woken up or startled
creations-chat 2020-11-23 16:52:45 I thought it was supposed to be a B17
creations-chat 2020-11-23 16:56:08 Wait like

The white B-17 tutorials I am seeing around..  aren't.. B-17s? I know nothing about planes I swear
creations-chat 2020-11-23 16:57:46 *the 2 tutorials look the fucking same*

Also yeah I see both
creations-chat 2020-11-23 16:59:40 I wanna make a B 17 because I've had some really good designs for the ball turret, the top gun, and the tail and nose guns for a while... But I'm scared it might look like the tutorial

Because I've watched people build them themselves

And end up with something that looks just like the tutorial
creations-chat 2020-11-23 17:01:36 Ik
That's
How you build
All planes
creations-chat 2020-11-23 17:03:54 I've only every built bombers and seaplanes.. fighters are just.. kinda boring to me
Idk
creations-chat 2020-11-23 17:09:18 Like

creations-chat 2020-11-23 17:23:11 Yeah but like

I thought that this was one of my better tank/tankette I've made so far
And yet it's getting the most downvotes
creations-chat 2020-11-24 20:03:41 
creations-chat 2020-11-24 20:07:04 ?
creations-chat 2020-11-24 20:29:39 I feel like there might be some confusion so to which end of the tankette is the front

The gun is tied down to face the rear of the tankette
It's done like this because because at some point when I am less loopy I might actually finish it's glider
creations-chat 2020-11-24 20:57:02 Yellow foil is more for probes that need to be lighter
creations-chat 2020-11-24 21:17:40 Mine like

But I have made a ratte a monster a T-35 and a T 42

Massive ground vehicles are slowly becoming my norm
I can probably figure out how it lengthen the hog
creations-chat 2020-11-25 23:31:21 What other tankettes should I make?
creations-chat 2020-11-25 23:32:52 <@456226577798135808> that's not a tankette
creations-chat 2020-11-25 23:36:19 It's a bit more then just a small tank.. it's perpose and general design is different

The wiesel is far too boring
It's some wedges with rockets
I don't like going those types of tanks...

creations-chat 2020-11-30 01:07:19 I was pinged?
creations-chat 2020-11-30 01:10:56 I did screenshot the chat. and you good sir started by calling peoples tank's trash.
creations-chat 2020-11-30 01:13:17 also I was neutral through that and did not insult you. I wanted you to fold it out so I could land a kettenkrad on it. it was pretty unimpressive though.
creations-chat 2020-11-30 01:14:50 also you claimed to have shipwright in chat which I can now see is wrong. and you claimed you would report everyone to your group and they would hunt us. which hasn't happened. so I am having alot of doubts here.
creations-chat 2020-11-30 01:16:23 was not in your plot. ever. never entered it.
creations-chat 2020-11-30 01:19:09 nobody else was either? you blacklisted them all for talking trash. I stayed silent and shot at you with fireworks. your attempts at trying to get us all banned are pretty wack

creations-chat 2021-01-14 08:55:11 that's kinda the defining feature of the G.38. it's wings were so huge that engineers walked passageways between them to service the engines mid flight and passengers sat in cabins within them looking out ahead
creations-chat 2021-01-18 09:56:12 Chonky boi go brrr
creations-chat 2021-01-18 10:20:01 I kinda expected my g38 to get downvoted for having to thick of wings even tho.. that's just how the g38's wings are.. that's it's defining feature
creations-chat 2021-01-19 23:22:45 I want to work on a jet.. ive also never done one before.. is the mitsubishi F-2 a good place to start or is that one done to death and mine will just be horrid no matter what?
creations-chat 2021-01-19 23:29:47 Im good at prop aircraft and planes, Im just not into jets like esthetically and know little about them. so like.. how difficult would the F2 be? mores so is it done to death because I don't want to do an aircraft everyone has done to death-
creations-chat 2021-01-19 23:34:51 okay thanks... I think I might still do it simply because it's the only jet I really like esthetically-

creations-chat 2021-02-01 16:24:40 <@!177743269105500160>  hey why did you downvote on my CA90's interior? asking cus I wanna improve anything wrong with it
creations-chat 2021-02-01 16:31:57 I wanted judgement on the interior that's all you were voting on?.. the interior is finished
creations-chat 2021-02-01 16:34:31 it was just to show the layout- and the other side is done and on it I cut it in half for the screenshots. and I posted the interior there, which was finished.
creations-chat 2021-02-01 16:36:33 I ligit just want to know the reason for the downvote Im really trying to get the interior on this right

I'm not complaining mind you, but if you have a reason to downvote I want to know it so I can fix it as I really wanna do good on this plane
creations-chat 2021-02-01 16:41:15 The exterior isn't done yet?.. I still have to do cableing and texture the paint. I posted the interior so I could get judgment on it
creations-chat 2021-02-01 16:45:53 where the fuck is camera
creations-chat 2021-02-01 16:48:23 you still never explained why
creations-chat 2021-02-01 17:00:42 that was again, just to show the interior's layout it was supposed to be judging the interior, the build obviously isn't cut in half and isn't saved like that
creations-chat 2021-02-02 15:06:22 Ill get a good 3 screenshots and then repost the CA 90 so I don't image spam okay?
creations-chat 2021-02-02 15:08:23 no I deleted that because it was image spam, so im going to get a few good screenshots rather then a bunch of meh ones.
creations-chat 2021-02-02 15:12:36 thanks
creations-chat 2021-02-02 15:14:45 Ive tried that in the past and nobody watches them so it just doesn't get voted on

creations-chat 2021-02-04 23:14:22 the interior took wway longer then the exterior-
creations-chat 2021-02-04 23:19:51 also i would just like to add- the only thing I could find about the interior for this plane is that it had a door here and where it's feul tanks were. everything else was improvised
creations-chat 2021-02-05 00:44:18 <@!177743269105500160> once again.. why the downvote?.. anything you actually want me to change on it to be better?
creations-chat 2021-02-05 00:52:05 he downvoted the first post on it's interior too and doged my questions until he landed on "It's a wip and I don't like how it's cut in half" then stopped responding
creations-chat 2021-02-05 00:56:45 im taking it seriously because otherwise nothing will change
creations-chat 2021-02-05 01:08:49 it's anoying that he downvoted it because he's the only one
creations-chat 2021-02-05 01:35:53 wait which part of it is the front doesn't it have like 4 huge entrances
creations-chat 2021-02-05 02:07:16 Well see i did all that and it got labled as image spam and mass downvoted. it is finnished that's why i posted it

creations-chat 2021-02-19 20:35:41 ditch the shitty ass rope. those blocks are super unstable. instead use trails and motors to control said trails. use wing panels for triangle rigged sails and use blocks and wedges for square rigged sails. here's a diagram of a fully rigged ship and all of it's various sails.
creations-chat 2021-02-19 20:37:48 it's an inside joke not a spelling mistake.

I browsed for a build at which I could excel
An idea for a ship in need of some planning
rope, sails, and wood, but lacking in manning.
What luck, says I, to find such good fortune
A few blocks down later, I spawned my ship in
folded some stuff no idea what's it do
Jumped on the deck, and I yelled to no crew
fold down the thing! speed up the whatsit!
What's that motor spinning? Somebody should stop it!
switch to cam 1! (that's cam 2) Now I've got it!
Trust me, I'm in control!

the-dump 2021-04-11 12:54:03 uh- yeah gender is a spectrum mate- even if you think trans/nb people don't exist what about intersex people? or people who- say, get certain parts blown off. are they no longer the gender associated or? see it's blurry.
the-dump 2021-04-11 12:55:59 *doesn't actually refute any of what I just said- but restates what he already said*

the-dump 2021-04-11 13:00:22 <:T_Pure:814983300899930142>
the-dump 2021-04-11 13:01:46 your definition of gender is based on what's in someone's pants right? well someone who is  intersex is literally in between male and female. or sometimes neither. so how do you work that into your idea of gender.
the-dump 2021-04-11 13:02:58 You can't right it off as an "epic fail" when it happens as often as it does. there is that funny statistic about it being as common as red-headed people after all.
the-dump 2021-04-11 13:03:48 either way- even if it was just 1 person. that still conflicts with your idea of a binary gender set because there is something outside of it. which means it isn't binary.
the-dump 2021-04-11 13:08:17 because they are still a person? what are they then. even if it's "genderless" that's still 3 options. which isn't binary. and given there are a near infinite ways it can happen it spreads it out to a near infinite amount of options just off that.
the-dump 2021-04-11 13:10:44 yet again you've evaded the question.
the-dump 2021-04-11 13:11:33 thats called s*xes
and again- that's not the case because intersex people exist
the-dump 2021-04-11 13:12:50 you were taught wrong- you can't demonstrate why gender is binary. we can demonstrate why it's not.
the-dump 2021-04-11 13:13:46 that's just how it is. Parroting that gender is binary without actually thinking about it is wrong. it's just not.
the-dump 2021-04-11 13:15:22 the bible was wrong there then. again intersex people exist- that is not a man or a women.
the-dump 2021-04-11 13:15:48 this tbh
the-dump 2021-04-11 13:16:47 yeah. so the bible was proven wrong. it said there were 2 genders. we found out that was wrong. therefor why are you still listening to it.
the-dump 2021-04-11 13:17:50 Yes.
the-dump 2021-04-11 13:18:56 I'm a Shintoist..
the-dump 2021-04-11 13:19:53 And dispite the fact that ancient scholars in the religion said there were only 2 genders. I can confidently say they are wrong. we proved them wrong.
the-dump 2021-04-11 13:22:22 even if you write intersex people off as a "Disability" that's still 3. and again given that there is an infinite number of ways that it can happen that's still more then fuckin 2. which is what binary means.
the-dump 2021-04-11 13:23:20 where do you put the line then. you agree there are more then 2 but what causes you to say there is a limit if it's not "man and women"
the-dump 2021-04-11 13:24:09 that's transphobia which I do believe is against the rules
the-dump 2021-04-11 13:24:52 then that's making fun of sucide. still pretty fucked mate.
the-dump 2021-04-11 13:25:02 wait hold on how?
the-dump 2021-04-11 13:26:17 Intersex people exist. and even if you wright them off as a disability that's at least 3.
the-dump 2021-04-11 13:26:57 which is still fuckin 3
the-dump 2021-04-11 13:27:32 yeah. that's not binary. binary is 2. anything other then 2 means there are more then 2 genders.
the-dump 2021-04-11 13:28:13 that's still a third option.
the-dump 2021-04-11 13:28:19 which is more then 2
the-dump 2021-04-11 13:28:56 not a mental disability if they legit have physically nothing-
the-dump 2021-04-11 13:30:55 you guys are just parroting the same things off each other and stating the same point without actually debating any of the things I say.
as such there is no point to say "2 plus another option even if rare (which it isn't but-) is more then 2" over and over again if your not going to actually give reaction to it other then "no 2"
the-dump 2021-04-11 13:31:47 I wasn't arguing about politics just gender. which isn't inherently political. and you were there too.
the-dump 2021-04-11 13:32:29 which is still more then 2- like if they are just gonna parrot this same thing there is no point
the-dump 2021-04-11 13:32:58 adding politics to the end of it doesn't make it politics
the-dump 2021-04-11 13:33:11 and this was calm and collected until you showed up
the-dump 2021-04-11 13:34:51 it wasn't.. a bunch of people piled in and started piling in parroting the same thing off eachother.
you were apart of that
the-dump 2021-04-11 13:35:28 no. gender dysphoria is. the treatment for it being transitioning.
the-dump 2021-04-11 13:36:36 this wasn't political until people showed up and labeled it political then tried to get me warned for being political
the-dump 2021-04-11 13:36:54 then why did you spend so long saying "only 2" over and over.
the-dump 2021-04-11 13:37:31 thats not what he said.
the-dump 2021-04-11 13:39:00 there saying "2 genders anything else is a mental illness" which- even if it's 2 and anything else that's still more then 2 like
bruh
the-dump 2021-04-11 13:39:59 and then in response to me calling out that's more then 2 they just go "it's 2 suck it up" again.
the-dump 2021-04-11 13:40:51 and you did it again- this really doesn't help your case
the-dump 2021-04-11 13:41:19 it was- and then it blew up and now people want me warned for that. like bruh
the-dump 2021-04-11 13:41:58 and you demonstrated the same thing twice. good job that's a new high score.
the-dump 2021-04-11 13:43:20 I didn't disobey rule 2. you lot got here and started making this spammy- it wasn't until you got here.
the-dump 2021-04-11 13:43:59 you still are here though
the-dump 2021-04-11 13:44:18 it was being civilly discussed
the-dump 2021-04-11 13:45:33 we were legit just talking and you guys got here and started spamming the same "2 genders" not listening to anything actually said. that wasn't a joke it killed the conversation. you then went on and tried to have me warned.
the-dump 2021-04-11 13:46:18 you not commenting on things you were never a part of exists, you know.
the-dump 2021-04-11 13:46:33 that's an insult.
the-dump 2021-04-11 13:47:12 if this is so obviously controversial why did you all flood this chat
the-dump 2021-04-11 13:50:55 This was a fucking pile on.
the-dump 2021-04-11 13:51:39 I'm not interested being somewhere I get dogpiled for no reason and warned for just talking.
creations-chat 2021-06-20 02:52:45 sure isnt.
creations-chat 2021-06-20 02:54:47 I don't put real nations flags on my builds.
And I don't particularly like japan.
creations-chat 2021-06-20 02:56:49 well aware.
creations-chat 2021-06-20 02:58:53 People downvoting a good build over a flag they don't like aren't people who's upvotes I wanted in the first place.
creations-chat 2021-06-20 03:08:49 I don't. It say this as someone who was born in japan it is one of the most exclusionary nations on earth. That said I prefer Japanese WW2 era subs and boats due to their interesting design philosophy. If you can find me a submarine aircraft carrier from a non imperialist power I will gladly build that instead.
creations-chat 2021-06-20 03:10:53 not aircraft carrying submarines (most large powers had subs with scout planes) submarine aircraft carriers. submarines who's primary weapon is it's aircraft.
creations-chat 2021-06-20 03:14:53 The real ones weren't exactly artwork either-(its kinda meant to look ugly and cobbled together last second)
creations-chat 2021-06-20 03:18:08 Its fine- the fact that everyone whos downvoted has done so for a reason other then the build's quality means there downvotes don't really mean anything to me- its not really feedback its more of "Bleh we dislike u lull"
creations-chat 2021-06-20 03:20:25 I like the flag sorry.
creations-chat 2021-06-20 03:24:30 rip
creations-chat 2021-06-20 03:31:46 Thats.. not racism.. I don't like japan ***the country***. I'm literally Japanese.
creations-chat 2021-06-20 03:53:24 I do it with any of my builds that require a flag mate. And I feel no need to change it it's a nice flag that suits me well.
creations-chat 2021-06-20 03:57:20 Well aware. I don't really care what the community thinks of me though as it's not a very good one and I'd rather just address
 actual feedback
creations-chat 2021-06-20 04:02:52 I like how bright flags look on war machines- adds a bit of colour.
creations-chat 2021-06-20 04:06:38 It's a sandbox game. Im aloud to accessorize my creations to my liking. sorry :/
creations-chat 2021-06-20 04:16:02 they aren't really racist they're just saying whatever to "bully" me (see message above^)
creations-chat 2021-06-20 04:21:26 once again thats kinda the point of a flag- any flag I could have put there would have stood out to much.
creations-chat 2021-06-20 04:25:26 Because I'm not a pirate and its not a combat airship
creations-chat 2021-06-20 04:35:16 any suggestions for my sailing ship btw?
creations-chat 2021-06-20 04:49:42 I think my own I-400 crashed me
creations-chat 2021-06-20 05:47:12 my I 400 is my most downvoted build lol- dispite it being one of my best
creations-chat 2021-06-20 05:50:09 nah I like it there. Im more laughing at the people who down voted it over that-

creations-chat 2021-06-20 10:19:49 So I've noticed.
creations-chat 2021-06-20 10:23:48 10 wing panels matter more when it comes to an up vote then all of the 8000 blocks I guess. Not surprised.
creations-chat 2021-06-20 10:25:57 This server isn't society it's closer to a pack of coyotes fighting over a dead cat
creations-chat 2021-06-20 12:04:45 Im tired as hell but wanna work on my G 38
creations-chat 2021-06-20 12:07:31 Wow that is some nasty and petty insulting. Are you okay dude because this really isn't something to get that mad over.
creations-chat 2021-06-20 12:11:42 Man remember when this wasn't the toxic chat. That was nice. Now my last 24 hours here have been watching someone get murdered by words over nothing and being pinged 23 times over my I-400 being too trans. 
Kinda sad really
creations-chat 2021-06-20 12:15:03 should I add a sail above the mainsail?
creations-chat 2021-06-20 12:17:37 nothings perfect lol, there has to be some improvement to be made 
Also yousuf it's undetailed because the drawing I did that it's based from had nothing much there its just part of the design
creations-chat 2021-06-20 12:19:39 It's a ship that ferries people across a river in hell. and It's based off a drawing I did- there never was a flag
creations-chat 2021-06-20 12:21:47 *Ik my I-400 has like 30 down votes just because of 10 wing panels. it's a 8000 block build*
creations-chat 2021-06-20 12:23:48 ight
creations-chat 2021-06-20 12:28:33 I heard "aft 5 inch gun" and thought someone else had made an I-400 and got excited 
am disappointed now- good build you get an upvote but man-
creations-chat 2021-06-20 12:37:53 well aware. I don't really care tho, people down voting for that reason aren't people who's upvotes I want.
creations-chat 2021-06-21 12:55:00 I made a turret- idk what to put it on yet
creations-chat 2021-06-21 12:58:48 The size is a perspective thing- I was trying to hide my character behind it. why would I remove the pink it's my fav color and works well with the pallet I'm using?
also it's named after a warrior cats character- as that tends to be my go too when I don't a good name
creations-chat 2021-06-21 13:03:01 That turret I made was hella armored with it so- Its good
creations-chat 2021-06-21 13:13:21 I really like mad vulpins building style- like ngl his bombers look nice- There is something about the simplicity I really like idk
*sadly I can't take insperation from the style as it would get called a tutorial lol*
creations-chat 2021-06-21 13:16:30 nobody listens if you point it out though. my H6K was constantly called a tutorial. it wasn't one but people inisisted it was
creations-chat 2021-06-21 13:22:29 I don't blame him jets are hella lame
creations-chat 2021-06-21 13:29:27 I'm pretty decent freinds with the guy- he can build well and puts hella effort into *his* builds- they're same quality as the other stuff on here
he just uses a more simplified building style for his tutorials. I actually like his tutorial style more as something about the simple fuesalages of them- idk I like it and I'm bad at re creating it. I over detail too much
creations-chat 2021-06-21 13:34:17 I only half agree with this- the wings suck- like I don't like 'flat' wings and they bug me
I do really like the simplistic fuselage style- specifically on his medium bombers it takes me back to when that sort of simplicity was acceptable in the community over all and I like it for that-
creations-chat 2021-06-21 13:37:04 the D C-47 is my favourite in terms of simplicity it's really nice
creations-chat 2021-06-21 13:40:50 his tanks are both really bad- and also weirdly detailed- like its not over detailed its got that simplicity but the details that are there are a weird selection of them
creations-chat 2021-06-21 13:46:05 tbf literally any tank that isnt perfect would get mas downvoted- same with jets too
this is why I don't post my IRL based tanks anymore it's so pointless yall want every angle and rivet right even on a tank made for pvp
creations-chat 2021-06-21 13:48:14 *Ima stick to taking ww2 tanks and like- adding bright paint schemes, fantasy or steampunk elements or random sail boat rigging thanks
I am the embodiment of tank junkie rage- 
my favourite tank is the T-35 landship and my I dispise the M1 abram tanks for lookin to basic- also my main pvp tank for the longest time was a modified american AAV
creations-chat 2021-06-21 13:58:55 actually thats pretty good- I mean ignoring the poor steering system (plane crazy boat mechanics are hard to get at first so Im giving that a pass-) thats a pretty impressive sail boat for a beginner. they can be pretty difficult to pull off and the fact he got the sails moving makes it even more impressive. also he did a trimaran design which I don't see often. overall it's a pretty good sailboat for someone newer to making them
creations-chat 2021-06-21 14:02:54 then again my sail boats aren't all that either-
creations-chat 2021-06-21 14:05:30 this was one of my earlier ones and yeah its kinda awfull now- (I had no idea how jibs and staysails were done lol)
creations-chat 2021-06-21 14:09:04 nah my sloops are a flex- *you don't understand how much of a pain that main sail was aaa*
creations-chat 2021-06-21 14:12:40 r u s t (use trails and some slight brown tinges on the parts)
creations-chat 2021-06-21 14:17:24 I remember I got such poor feedback when I posted this and I still don't understand why
creations-chat 2021-06-21 14:22:10 the longest part wasn't building it but getting it to sail straight and steer- as it's a unsymmetrical catamaran- also thats not my best boat its like one of my least impressive lol
creations-chat 2021-06-21 14:27:00 the exposed lock looks fine there lol
creations-chat 2021-06-21 14:33:31 opinions on making one of these?
creations-chat 2021-06-21 14:35:34 it's a fox armoured car and I think it could be done but its gonna be a pain-
creations-chat 2021-06-22 18:57:43 re making my favorite tank because my old one was garbage-
creations-chat 2021-06-22 19:02:08 Advice- historically theach tore up all the upper decks and replaced them t fit more guns and better crew accommodations- as such the use of signs as planks on edges, a lack of study railings and an overall cobbled together look of the upper section of the ship is accurate to the historical one (though most depictions overlook this)
creations-chat 2021-06-22 19:05:36 Blackbeard rebuilt half his ship after he captured it. as such it shouldn't be too pretty the whole thing was held together with ducktape and string
creations-chat 2021-06-23 07:15:38 So.. my games saved are screwed- my CA-90, I-400 and large schooner are all gone saved over by a main battletank I was working on- not by me mind you (I haven't saved it to other slots) but when I tried to load them it said the saves were corrupted and then loaded the tank.. so they're just gone now

creations-chat 2021-06-24 10:24:35 he's right- there were 2 guns made
one was larger and required 8 more trains to aim it (thats the generally displayed one)

((they may have also been the same gun but downsized as war materials ran low- this lines  up with most 1940s German super weopons fate))

From the British: Churchill Heavy infantry tank 
From the Japanese: O-1 super heavy tank

Which of these should I do next?
creations-chat 2021-06-24 14:18:47 idk if I disserve my expert roles lol-
creations-chat 2021-06-24 15:08:13 I mean- yeah but also people frequently give me downvotes for trans flags or for me being a furry and its pretty annoying
creations-chat 2021-06-24 15:11:41 *It's not just during pride month* people are just transphobic
creations-chat 2021-06-24 15:17:39 This is called suppression and is discrimitory. No thanks.
creations-chat 2021-06-24 15:20:38 Because if I can't display a trans flag on my personal builds without harassment that's suppression and is actively reductive. It forces people to say silent about themselves and their problems and that isn't a good thing.
creations-chat 2021-06-24 15:25:54 I mean its not sexuality it's apart of my identity. I put it on my builds to represent myself. and how is putting something on my build shoving it in your face? I'm allowed to do so If I want. the fact I do so isn't an excuse or reason. the real reason people throw a fit about it is simple biggotry
creations-chat 2021-06-24 15:28:09 My Identity isn't a problem until people make it one.
creations-chat 2021-06-24 15:30:16 I don't choose that as a whole? It's the only thing I have a cute flag for but It's not me as a whole.
Also you literally do have too announce your identity to everyone- that's what a name is and thusly how one introduces themselves. 
this is my last message and I started it before the change topics announcment.
creations-chat 2021-06-24 15:32:30 ya'll are all the fail-
creations-chat 2021-06-24 15:35:42 You mean people walking up to my t-35 ragdolling on it and sending it flying? yea I noticed
creations-chat 2021-06-24 15:37:53 nope- thats not my suspension as it didn't happen until the update it's something to do with motor 2 Im pretty sure- is not my suspension that flings me its generally the turrets.
creations-chat 2021-06-25 06:31:17 T28 progress
creations-chat 2021-06-25 06:34:43 Its tracks also do that thing- though I might change it's detatchment to used timed charges from front to back - caus GUP scene>accuracy
creations-chat 2021-06-25 06:42:22 Just this-
creations-chat 2021-06-25 06:46:46 I don't..? Irl the tank took a while to convert its drive to just one track set then detach them. I however don't hold my builds to realism that's dumb- my t35 looks too narrow to me if it's accurate- so I widened it, and mmy ratte doesn't have the flak turrets because it looked too cluttered with them to me. I'm not building for realism I'm doing it for fun.
and the absurdity of GUP is very fun.
creations-chat 2021-06-25 06:48:50 then wth is the point of building a BT-5? lol
creations-chat 2021-06-25 06:50:53 Sorry you can't read more then a sentence. <:shruggingpheo:723638011987886135>
creations-chat 2021-06-25 06:53:13 or ya could just you know, stop being pointlessly inflammatory like this. just a suggestion. Might avoid problems in the future idk.
creations-chat 2021-06-25 06:58:09 More inflammation. shame. Ima step away from this now and get back to my building thanks.
creations-chat 2021-06-25 07:26:39 obligitory reminder the tank Im making was 'lost' for decades before being found in some bushes in Virginia. real hidden
creations-chat 2021-06-25 07:30:30 thats not even the funniest part- what's really funny is that of it's 4 track sets (2 removable) it only had 3 when they found it.. so what the hell happened to the fourth one?
creations-chat 2021-06-25 08:30:39 That makes sense- it's still really funny
creations-chat 2021-06-25 13:29:31 someone should do this
creations-chat 2021-06-25 14:03:08 should I make my T-35 into a proper *landship* by giving it random ship parts- kinda like how I did my half track monster forever ago?
creations-chat 2021-06-25 14:07:12 It was- sadly it can't fly anymore as motor 2s broke but It can still drive around- here's the original post https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/384025409945337856/820574047590154271
creations-chat 2021-06-25 14:09:18 I just kept adding stuff to my half track until I passed out and that's what came of it- it's one of my favorite builds because it's pure just whatever I felt like-
creations-chat 2021-06-25 14:11:27 ya'll are the only ones insisting we're doing something again.
*someone just went and retroactively downvoted my half-whateverthehellitis. danm that's consistent effort*
creations-chat 2021-06-25 14:17:00 that wasn't my only conversion of that half track- I got a lot of mileage out of that danm thing 
Also no idk what the church is.
creations-chat 2021-06-27 16:22:09 I wanna build the WP-30
Miazaki's version of the Japanese KI-20, itself a variant of the Ju G-38
It keeps the G-38's wing windows and adds like- a ton of turrets and fun stuff
creations-chat 2021-06-27 16:24:20 
creations-chat 2021-06-27 16:42:19 Turns out the monitor and Virginia did a lil bi more then fight- as clear by the results
creations-chat 2021-06-27 16:44:49 ik- it looks like the result of the monitor and Virginia's side fling
creations-chat 2021-06-27 16:47:01 why does this have so many upvotes?.. I mean the hull is fine but the rigging and lack of any attempt at staysails is.. aa
creations-chat 2021-06-27 17:01:51 uh.. no?.. the sails look really off and there are no staysails
creations-chat 2021-06-27 17:04:40 It's not.. thats not my ship- my ships have the opposite problem of having better sails then hulls
creations-chat 2021-06-27 17:06:42 I can only really be critical of older ships- I don't vote on much else as they are my main specialty and the only thing I feel I can cast votes on
creations-chat 2021-06-27 17:23:46 Add them heccin like- wedgy things
creations-chat 2021-06-27 17:40:21 Fair enough- it's honestly pretty good it's just not 100 upvotes good-
creations-chat 2021-06-27 17:42:24 ehhh- there is a lot of room for staysails there
creations-chat 2021-06-27 18:30:17 or if the builds contain things people are scared of :/
creations-chat 2021-06-27 21:14:45 "why are you like this"
creations-chat 2021-06-28 12:17:52 I love the heart shaped AA mounts on the back of US ww2 frigates- like they are just one of those thins I really like for no other reason then "oo pretty"
creations-chat 2021-06-28 12:34:07 I was gonna mount a katusha rocket platform on my T-35-propoganda esc landship version but like- there isn't anywhere that makes sense it's already so crowded
creations-chat 2021-06-28 12:40:30 but there is no where to do it- like the only place is on the engine grate but then they'd fire right into the ship mast/radar/tower thingy on it
creations-chat 2021-06-28 13:57:23 there is a mast and bridge up there
creations-chat 2021-06-28 21:45:46 I have decided to build what has to be the most obscure plane ever- so obscure I can only find 3 drawings of it and found it through a typo- the caproni CA 91
creations-chat 2021-06-28 21:52:19 from what I can tell it's a hypothetical continuation the design philosophies caproni started with the the CA 51 scout plane and continued all the way to the massive CA 90 (one of my favorite planes and one I have previously built) weirdly despite closely resembling it and seeming like the direct derivative  of it- this plane seems to have come before the CA90 as it maintains the closer together engines of the ca 70-80 (an inefficient design that was changed midway through designing  the CA 90)
creations-chat 2021-06-28 21:55:30 The CA-60 is unrelated to said philosophies and was more akin to his other passenger planes he had previously made which had all been developments off of the CA-4 and 5
(you can see how this design could become the CA 60)
creations-chat 2021-06-29 02:17:08 should I paint the CA 91 like my other italian aircraft (bright base color with italian tri color lower wings and tail) or should I go for something more prototype-y or something closer to realistic cammo for a sea plane
creations-chat 2021-06-29 13:49:11 so the CA 91 is a bit bigger then the CA 90 and im going to have to fold the tail- how do I get the custom angle to look right in the transition from the fold (im still kinda learning)
creations-chat 2021-06-29 13:51:14 you can't use motor 2 for a custom angle it spazzes out..
creations-chat 2021-06-29 13:53:49 what-
creations-chat 2021-06-29 14:14:44 wehraboos scare me- ya'll really be likin big ineffective tanks that much that some of yall are willing to drench themselves in the baggage they carried- and like- they weren't even that good as a whole there were far more hilarious failures then the one or 2 good tanks they made and even then by the time they made some good tanks- it was too late for em
creations-chat 2021-06-29 14:16:49 imagine being unable to read more then 7 words smh
creations-chat 2021-06-30 05:04:29 lol when did ya'll decide my ground vehlicles were any good
creations-chat 2021-06-30 05:12:17 I was in PVP and actively bein shot at lol-
bot-central 2021-06-30 05:59:31 !servers
creations-chat 2021-06-30 15:53:44 the weakest part of my new snow mobile is it's gun which is unarmored against bullets and unhoming rockets-but much like the original one thats not really an issue as it moves too fast to be shot at
creations-chat 2021-06-30 16:15:40 fast isn't the right word- its top speed is 230 afterall- I guess a better word is menouverable- like its very very sharp in turning and its sliding around makes it hard to hit
creations-chat 2021-06-30 16:18:03 it also teliports so missiles are just useless-
creations-chat 2021-06-30 16:43:02 my build was shown next to it so-
creations-chat 2021-06-30 16:45:04 that was kinda the point yea-
creations-chat 2021-06-30 16:47:08 my build is also shown on my plot so the rules are fine :/
creations-chat 2021-06-30 17:28:30 you guys are really fussing over nothing but ight I'll delete it smh
creations-chat 2021-06-30 17:30:32 man never heard that one before, good ol "I can't argue with you so let me hurry and discredit so I don't have too"
creations-chat 2021-06-30 17:32:46 Not really, you seem to be though given how adamant you are to ping me every 2 minutes.
creations-chat 2021-06-30 17:36:02 oh my god your still pinging me bruh let me video game in peace
creations-chat 2021-06-30 17:41:12 I was playing bioshock infinite smh
creations-chat 2021-06-30 17:56:21 and proud.
creations-chat 2021-06-30 18:02:46 you gonna back that with anything or just leave a baseless statement?
creations-chat 2021-06-30 18:06:04 I'm not the first person to do that in a mocking manner and Its also not the first time Ive done it- this was just the first time It goot that much attention :/
creations-chat 2021-07-01 02:05:29 Anyone have any more arisoni I should make?

creations-chat 2021-07-01 15:50:25 Incase you thought I had gotten enough of that soviet BDE-
creations-chat 2021-07-01 15:55:05 false-  just simp for whatever country has the wackest shit for me to build- so generally the USSR or japan
creations-chat 2021-07-01 15:57:12 I'm from japan I'm immune to the weeaboo virus thanks-
creations-chat 2021-07-01 16:04:39 Y E S
creations-chat 2021-07-02 17:09:03 gave up the helicopter- someone suggested I do this and honestly it's a way funner sounding build
creations-chat 2021-07-02 17:12:56 like there is a lot of interesting stuff Im gonna have to do- from the large skeletons in the trophy room bit to the aircraft hanger and ramp- the airship might very well be the easiest part
creations-chat 2021-07-02 22:43:48 e x c u s e m e w h a t
creations-chat 2021-07-02 23:09:06 I'm allergic to them- but that's okay it's not like I'm going to crash into a truck full of them after beating cancer or smth
creations-chat 2021-07-04 06:44:29 Freaks of nature span a globe, that's too big to deny
With canine guards, we'll travel there and spit into their eye
I can't wait another day
For my life to waste away
We'll make it a joint venture, before we're in our dentures
My Spirit of Adventure is you!

creations-chat 2021-07-04 17:48:45 *also the trump tank is both really good and also absolute sin*
creations-chat 2021-07-04 17:50:48 this has nothing to do with the creation.
creations-chat 2021-07-04 18:47:36 airships are just too big to build in full scale in game and it's kinda saddening
creations-chat 2021-07-04 18:52:36 like I really like the layout of this ship but it's too big to properly do
creations-chat 2021-07-04 18:59:27 Ya'll gettin political
creations-chat 2021-07-04 19:21:09 i did once- it can't easily move though
creations-chat 2021-07-05 01:18:06 Why are so many people slappin the American flags on things rn? like half of these don't even look that good-
creations-chat 2021-07-05 01:20:08 ok.. and..? it's just the 4th
creations-chat 2021-07-05 01:22:39 I'm not British and why is it on July 4th..? Nothing significant happened that day that I can remember.
creations-chat 2021-07-05 01:24:59 I'm not. I don't get why you'd celebrate independence day on the 4th didn't you guys win the war later on then july?
and also
what the hell do you even do for "independence day" it seems like just a nationalist flag wave from what i've seen
creations-chat 2021-07-05 01:28:05 *also July 4th 1778 isn't the 4th of July because of the whole calendar thing so ya'll still doin this on the wrong day*
what the hell does "celebrate independence" mean though?
teenagers celebrate independence the first time the drive alone
an entire nation doing it seems a bit much
creations-chat 2021-07-05 01:30:27 because china gave up on actual communism a while ago and in china the word "communism" is just interchangeable for "government"
doesn't seem that different from the american 4th all things considered.
creations-chat 2021-07-05 01:35:17 Idk man, disenfranchising native americans, owning the Philippians, bleaching people, reducing panama to a puppet through a coup, reducing every other central American country to a puppet often through coups, forcing much of the eastern nations to their side often through undercutting democracy and with coups- just to fight communism, korea and Vietnam, anything ever involving the stupid tax payed for U-2 spyplane we still use- all sounds good to me.
creations-chat 2021-07-05 01:38:08 my PC autocorrected it to that because it dislikes proper nouns- you knew what I meant
creations-chat 2021-07-05 01:40:30 I'm not a chat lurker I'm here pretty often :/
creations-chat 2021-07-05 01:42:56 there isn't an argument  or debate here- nobody has offered anything of note against what I said- and I was adding to a joke myself in laughing about america. one person called out a typo and another person called me a lurker. thats not a debate.
creations-chat 2021-07-05 01:45:03 that's adding to a joke. if you want to pick that out am I aloud to pick out every other meme sent in this chat as unrelated?
creations-chat 2021-07-05 01:49:04 Sir this is what we would call continuing an argument. stop it.
creations-chat 2021-07-05 02:00:53 I didn't say it was bad- I just don't think it's the best nation to ever grace this earth either- also we were told to drop this
creations-chat 2021-07-05 02:04:54 I don't respect an island that is so full of itself it splits itself into like 7 parts then acts like it's one thing but not really while harrasing  everyone else for 2 centuries and subjugating it's neighbor to the point of mass starvation- several times
creations-chat 2021-07-05 02:06:57 That was also a joke oh my god you guys take everything too seriously- while somehow still spamming memes I don't understand.
creations-chat 2021-07-05 02:08:58 how was what I said any more unrelated then- say this?
like how am I the only one warned for this-
creations-chat 2021-07-05 02:12:11 yeah. I'm the only one warned for continuing 'something' despite it being one a joke (which there doesn't seem to be a problem with here) and two several other people were doing it. ya'll have a double standard and I'm going to just stop posting here about anything other then *my builds*
creations-chat 2021-07-05 02:15:04 with a joke- which nobody ever actually disagreed with you guys just went on about how "omg argument" despite there being no argument- and I got warned
creations-chat 2021-07-05 02:17:09 got it. you guys wat me to stop talking. I'll stop talking.
creations-chat 2021-07-05 03:30:06 120, 100, 70 to 140, 100, 70 in a gradient.
creations-chat 2021-07-05 05:50:18 Color pickers from direct images work poorly for plane crazy due to lighting- it's better to find a direct pallet or to just approximate lots of he pixels into a few shades. there are programs for this.
creations-chat 2021-07-05 07:59:44 I need something to do between long stints of working on my spirit of adventure- any improvements I could make for this?
creations-chat 2021-07-05 08:02:20 there is a lil bit that sticks up there it was kinda intentional-
creations-chat 2021-07-05 08:04:29 that entire front piece would be able to fold down and be used as a snow break for the vehicle 
thats the latch for it
creations-chat 2021-07-05 08:06:53 like? that one looks fine and it's a good place for the motor anyways
creations-chat 2021-07-05 08:10:18 idk how accurate this one is but it gets the idea across. I used several images mostly from modelers as references actual images of this type are hard to find
creations-chat 2021-07-05 08:13:21 that's a lot of motor lock for such a simple build but I'll try it
I will say I will not be doing anything that requires me removing interior-
creations-chat 2021-07-05 08:16:45 also might take a crack at the snow shoe tonk
creations-chat 2021-07-05 08:37:39 what's really amazing is how tank like it really is- like design wise
for ease of production it used a tank's engine and used old armor plating from BTs and obviously the turret
creations-chat 2021-07-05 08:48:06 Aerosan are some of my favorite soviet ground vehicles. they're sleds. with guns. what isn't to love?
creations-chat 2021-07-05 17:33:01 that hull tho
creations-chat 2021-07-05 17:42:05 that's fair enough
creations-chat 2021-07-05 18:13:22 Tu-95. it gets overlooked to often even though it's a dope plon
creations-chat 2021-07-05 18:25:12 early Junkers transport and passenger planes are like- really nice
creations-chat 2021-07-05 19:11:06 and I love it
creations-chat 2021-07-05 19:39:52 I wish ropes had physics- a barrage balloon would be epic
creations-chat 2021-07-05 20:20:26 after my spirit of adventure I might do one of these bigger deployment trucks ^w^
creations-chat 2021-07-05 21:08:55 I wanna make a sci-fi spaceship at some point but every time I make one it just becomes a pseudo airship and I just make another airship
creations-chat 2021-07-05 21:48:57 man just had to talk trash
creations-chat 2021-07-05 22:04:21 I am gonna build a weapon  superior to any of your nooby tanks
creations-chat 2021-07-05 22:09:47 lucky
creations-chat 2021-07-05 22:54:29 No. it is a force if nature. the instrument of god.
creations-chat 2021-07-05 23:38:58 "come look at the submarine I just made"
the submarine:
creations-chat 2021-07-05 23:43:02 your right, your right- let me correct it
creations-chat 2021-07-05 23:52:23 idk I always use wing panels- you can actually see them
creations-chat 2021-07-06 00:05:26 I like yeeting people with rope flags- my mecha destroyer SPG does a good job at sending them to south America
creations-chat 2021-07-06 00:35:53 same
creations-chat 2021-07-06 05:13:32 that moment when someone sees you working on a airship and pulls out their own and it looks like this
creations-chat 2021-07-06 05:19:42 I do this but with boats- to be fair my problem is I work from the inside out- which normally works fine. it's how I get impressive interiors with my tanks, planes and dirigibles (the like one good thing I'm known for)- but with smaller boats it just makes them a bit oversized
creations-chat 2021-07-06 06:00:30 *trying to decide if the spirit of adventure should have proper lighting- like as nice as this is it took like 7 hours of fiddling*
creations-chat 2021-07-06 06:43:22 could also do the steampunk pidgeon from my favorite game-
creations-chat 2021-07-06 06:47:51 
creations-chat 2021-07-06 07:00:34 I like it but my favorite jet is the sea vixen so I know nofin
creations-chat 2021-07-06 07:34:00 idk I like it- it's nice and simple
creations-chat 2021-07-06 07:37:16 like if your just downvoting because "it's not good enough for that many upvotes" without an actual reason to downvote an otherwise allright build, your just gatekeeping simplicity
creations-chat 2021-07-06 07:41:18 allright. just wanted to make sure you knew you were being terrible. carry on the gatekeeping then. 

<@!524910047080480769> your boatmobile is good and there isn't a good reason for anyone to downvote it. don't listen to anyone saying otherwise.
creations-chat 2021-07-06 07:44:58 I get a vote same as everyone else- so pretty sure it does
creations-chat 2021-07-06 07:49:55 I was hoping you'd ask- I actually really like the jet but the paint is kinda.. ehhhhhhh
a better gradient from the white to blue and some marking details would really help.
creations-chat 2021-07-06 07:52:16 the transition from white to blue is weird
creations-chat 2021-07-06 07:54:55 oh what the hell- okay I didn't know that (I'm not a jet person) I'll change my vote then
creations-chat 2021-07-06 07:57:23 I agree the jet looks great I was just wrong about the paint because it looked odd to me-
creations-chat 2021-07-06 07:59:41 I mean.. both are good though.. sure one is better but the boatmobile is just kind of fine? like there isn't any reason to downvote it and a lot of people saw it and thusly upvoted. I agree the turtle is better but that doesn't leave any reason to dislike the first for just being fine. and all your doing by doing so is dissuading someone from building bigger more complicated builds like the turtle.
creations-chat 2021-07-06 08:03:59 generally yeah but that's also not always the case. Especially not if the community decides to spread a meme around about it being shit, decides they don't like 5 wing panels on it, decides it's overdone or from a property they don't like or decides it's the wrong version of something based purely on subjectivity-
creations-chat 2021-07-06 08:07:59 Idk mahn I could talk lik this if ya want bruh
creations-chat 2021-07-06 08:15:53 I want to make like a- mecha thing at some point
something that has legs or maybe wings
probably song bird a scarab or maybe even howl's castle-
creations-chat 2021-07-06 08:18:04 doing howl's castle would be fun as so many little bits of it move just slightly. the whole thing is fluid- idk how I would interior it
creations-chat 2021-07-06 08:35:24 It's a complex ass build and any examination of it for more then 2 seconds will show that-

but people see a boat with 100 upvotes and get salty about their average over motor locked jet getting less then downvote
creations-chat 2021-07-06 08:37:26 he literally just explained how.
danm you guys are quick to jump to insults.
creations-chat 2021-07-06 08:39:54 the wheels had nothing to do with any of that- but they also work with the build I don't see the problem with a block in the game being used.
the-dump 2021-07-06 08:40:10 
creations-chat 2021-07-06 08:42:07 People do this with the wheels, skis, props and jets too
but given your scale allows for it or you just using it for other detailing there isn't a problem with doing it outright
creations-chat 2021-07-06 08:44:10 "Alright I'd like to point out that, even though it's very small, I used a fair bit of motor lock. The details I used motor lock for include:
- the black trim going around the whole body
- the flag; double sided text with a piston locked trail
- the wheels"
creations-chat 2021-07-06 08:48:44 To bring landing gear flush with other blocks you have to lock it into them.
creations-chat 2021-07-06 08:50:48 nope. they don't sit flush with half blocks
creations-chat 2021-07-06 08:52:51 ok and? it doesn't matter how trivial it's added to everything else.
creations-chat 2021-07-06 08:54:54 again is there anything wrong with it? because you can point out how simple or trivial it is all you want but if there isn't anything wrong with it there really is no reason to downvote.
creations-chat 2021-07-06 09:02:58 okay and.. there isn't anything wrong with the build?
Sorry people get bored of the 7000th overdetailed jet fighter.
so a simple build posted at the right time attracts a lot of positive attention.
all that trying to start a mass downvote of it does is discourage people from building bigger grander things
creations-chat 2021-07-06 09:06:03 but the same applies in reverse- when every "good" build looks the same and the community standard is so high on complicated builds. a small simple but nice looking build looks appealing. this isn't rocket science it's oversaturation.
creations-chat 2021-07-06 09:08:04 the trailer is really good- the boat needs work
creations-chat 2021-07-06 09:10:21 Because this isn't a first time thing- you guys gatekeep and drive out newer people so much over such nonsense.
creations-chat 2021-07-06 09:14:03 That's not rank farming it's people building things they like? their isn't some nefarious reason or coercive plan it's just a nice looking build made by someone who liked the show or game. sorry your 5000th jet doesn't get as much attention.
creations-chat 2021-07-06 09:17:36 I wasn't talking about Minecraft- I'm not defending those they're oversaturated as hell just like your jets are.
but not anything that isn't 2000 blocks with more motors then surface blocks deserves a downvote
creations-chat 2021-07-06 09:20:20 yeah. but that doesn't mean anything that isn't a 4k block custom angle jet can't have 100 upvotes. downvoting for reasons other then build quality or because it has "to many upvotes" is just petty gatekeeping.
creations-chat 2021-07-06 09:22:23 don't mince words. that's just gatekeeping again.
creations-chat 2021-07-06 09:26:37 maybe rather then complaining about something being more liked then you wanted it you guys should take some notes. if a simple ass boat boat gets more upvotes then your stuff maybe rather then trying to start a mass downvote train on it you should think about what it did right to get that much attention in the first place. your not leveling anything. it was level when it was clear what people's opinions on it were. your just mad it got more upvotes then what you guys think is "real effort" regardless of quality or what people actually think.
creations-chat 2021-07-06 09:28:58 ah yes. the famous "I refuse to acknowledge arguments so let's check that grammar" 
you guys really like this one.
creations-chat 2021-07-06 09:30:59 this is still misrepresenting my point. I don't care how many upvotes it gets but people downvoting builds because "they have too many upvotes" is just petty gatekeeping.
creations-chat 2021-07-06 09:33:42 doesn't matter if they are newer or what.
who are you guys to dictate what the entire player base is or isn't allowed to think? this is what gatekeeping is. you guys are a relatively small group trying to dictate what the entire community thinks is okay on arbitrary self serving reasons.
creations-chat 2021-07-06 09:36:07 really. if your the player base and you hate the boat build- wonder who upvoted it?
strange it's almost like you guys are a majority voice minority.
And not actually representative of the community.
creations-chat 2021-07-06 09:38:09 Entirely unrelated. I don't see why you need to bring this up every time you speak to me when it is liteally never related.
creations-chat 2021-07-06 09:42:04 we all get one vote. complaining about lesser skilled people being able to cast their votes and disagreeing with you the minority, is called elitism.
creations-chat 2021-07-06 09:47:31 I mean. Several people like me here I have several friends in this community. I'm not leaving just because this one channel of elitists thinks I am satan incarnate or some SJW or whatever the hell. I don't care what you guys think of me.
I'm still going to call you lot out on being the minority and it's telling that whenever I do so you guys just reply with either a useless meme or an emoji. 
You never actually have an argument to back your elitism and it's telling.
you guys don't actually have ground to stand on here and no new players have to listen to your nonsense. you guys are like plane crazy boomers and it's just sad.
creations-chat 2021-07-06 09:50:24 you really have nothing else to get at me for? like you keep going back to that despite it being ENTIERLY unrelated.
and no your ranks don't back your elitism in the slightest- gatekeeping like this is how a community dies.
creations-chat 2021-07-06 09:53:16 V V V LIKE THIS V V V

once again you guy can't actually back anything so send a bunch of memes screenshots and a literal wall on the stages of grief which have nothing to do with this.
God this chat is so toxic. You guys are the embodiment with everything wrong with "high standards plane crazy"
it's just elitism with shiny paint and no actual backing aside from a video game you wasted more time on.
Reacting to this with more memes, insults or otherwise unrelated comments to my arguments only proves my point further.
creations-chat 2021-07-06 09:58:02 v v v LIKE THIS v v v   Reacting to this with more memes, insults or otherwise unrelated comments to my arguments only proves my point further.
creations-chat 2021-07-06 10:02:08 I didn't lose. none of you have proven me wrong or even tried too you just continued shouting in your echo chamber until I decided enough new people had seen it to not be dissuaded with posting.
creations-chat 2021-07-06 10:04:15 and the chorus of the echo chamber continues.
creations-chat 2021-07-06 10:06:25 v v v LIKE THIS v v v   Reacting to this with more memes, insults or otherwise unrelated comments to my arguments only proves my previous point further.


cute trick. I can say "no you" too.
creations-chat 2021-07-06 10:09:45 v v v LIKE THIS v v v   Reacting to this with more memes, insults or otherwise unrelated comments to my arguments only proves my previous point further.

see this is funny because It was literally what you just did. yet that flew over the heads of you and all of your friends all responded with the exact same things. this chat is such a toxic meme laden echo chamber that either you can't even recognize your own hypocrisy or you refuse too because it would mean recognizing your wrong.
creations-chat 2021-07-06 10:13:48 v v v LIKE THIS v v v   Reacting to this with more memes, insults or otherwise unrelated comments to my arguments only proves my previous point further. Same with 5 people saying the same thing over and over again.

welp the echo chamber of people who already disagreed with me when this started have decided that I am "defeated" 
guess that totally and unbiasly proves me entirely wrong
creations-chat 2021-07-06 10:19:17 v v v LIKE THIS v v v  (copying my message while saying nothing on it doesn't help your case either it just further proves the echo chamber) Ps. a paragraph is 6-8 sentences.

''we shouted down the original builder therefore we are right"
creations-chat 2021-07-06 10:21:45 That was addressed to Prayut.
creations-chat 2021-07-06 10:26:35 V V V FURTHER PROOF V V V
 No it won't. I was the only one warned last time. the echo chamber consensus is that I'm wrong, political, argumentative, so on so it'd just be me like with the warn.
creations-chat 2021-07-06 10:29:37 Oh my god literally nobody but you has mentioned the trans flag sthu about it it's unrelated entirely
creations-chat 2021-07-06 10:33:00 of course they will. again it's an echo chamber and I'm disrupting the toxicity. why would someone address the problem when they can just let it sit in equilibrium?
creations-chat 2021-07-06 10:35:24 also for me being the one continuing these arguments- there are like 7 of you if I'm so wrong why don't you just right me off? I have to keep talking to defend myself as the moment I stop all 7 of you are going to start trash talking *which you always do*
you guys can drop the crap whenever
creations-chat 2021-07-06 10:37:27 v v v LIKE THIS v v v   Reacting to this with more memes, insults or otherwise unrelated comments to my arguments only proves my previous point further. 

the fact so many people had to reply to that one message only proves it further. you guys keep falling for this.
creations-chat 2021-07-06 10:39:36 and I never disagreed with either of those points. my argument was that the appropriate response to that isn't to mass downvote it.
creations-chat 2021-07-06 10:41:50 I don't think namnamm knows what elitism means :/

ratio doesn't need to be falsely balanced by a bunch of elitists. if it had that many upvotes it was probably for a good reason even if you can't discern it.
creations-chat 2021-07-06 10:44:46 wrong reply 

this was literally my only point- a bunch of people liked it- a few people hated it and so tried to start a mass downvote. It had nothing to do with the builds quality 

and I only care because downvotes and upvotes should actually mean something. you know related to the build?
creations-chat 2021-07-06 10:47:44 oh idk maybe the spamming of a meme around it started by one person that massively changed the upvote downvote ratio. seems that person's opinion has more sway.
creations-chat 2021-07-06 10:50:05 okay I have shit to do I'm done explaining shit to you. this warn will be fun. you can stop pinging me with replies now.
creations-chat 2021-07-06 10:53:09 Nah man I have shit to do so I have to leave. if you lot are so insistent on my banning I can just leave. I don't need this server for self assurance like ya'll

creations-chat 2023-04-14 13:21:03 can we like- maybe fix the vote system or smth it seems gay as hecc
I remember it being better what changed
creations-chat 2023-04-14 13:24:43 Lol I would love to know what standards are responsible for the downvotes on my poor corvette
creations-chat 2023-04-14 13:29:33 like idc normally but yall know for a fact it is to early for that ratio on THAT corvette
creations-chat 2023-04-14 14:17:38 To this day I still wish I had made it just a biiiit longer
creations-chat 2023-04-14 14:23:05 my builds tend to go for a more toony style for sure- but they look pleasing to the eye in a way highly detailed realistic builds don't and work better with the game I think
creations-chat 2023-04-14 14:29:09 That's a non binary flag
creations-chat 2023-04-14 14:32:38 flags can represent anything numnuts 
pirates flew flags that stood for no nation
creations-chat 2023-04-14 14:35:17 well no- thats a bit of a misconception. historically almost no pirates flew skulls, that came later when they were written about by Victorian playwrights 
Pirates flew red and black flags depicting other things tho!
creations-chat 2023-04-14 14:39:34 It's armorment is ass because accuracy to the real one from japan. 

And the ship is representing me. Me alone. why would I put some country Idc about.
creations-chat 2023-04-14 14:41:41 idc what the server likes the server is dumb lol- as for realism

that's what the ship was for you raise flags to show things about the realistic ship you just put them on.
creations-chat 2023-04-14 14:44:21 do you get off to putting others down? like literally none of my boats I posted are bad chill.
they're toony and simplistic, but that's a stylistic choice not something to try and spill over on like legit nobody cares butchu
creations-chat 2023-04-14 14:47:07 you lot have some high ass standards- like are you fr 
people in here really gonna downvote because a boat hull has a wedge or seam when the rest of the boat is entirely perfect
creations-chat 2023-04-14 14:50:13 I don't see what that has to do with anything? what standards are you trying to set you guys look like wine snobs lol literally nobody cares this much about nonsense like this
creations-chat 2023-04-14 14:52:52 which look fine? exposed locks look fine in ship hulls they aren't a cardinal sin.
creations-chat 2023-04-14 14:54:54 you guys are the only people who have ever had a problem- you're the only two people I've ever seen this toxic lol 
it's so gross you're so high on your own supply

elitist snops fr fr
creations-chat 2023-04-14 14:56:58 You're an egotist and I find your question repugnant. I'm going back to photographing my years worth of builds now lol kindly bugger off
creations-chat 2023-04-14 15:02:20 no but the motors being on the outside bug me so much I hate them so much omg
creations-chat 2023-04-14 15:12:21 there is one painted on in real life in the same place, it'd look better with further detailing of the rest of the ship im sure but ofc I  never did it 

also I don't do it in the water because I really like getting the hull-keel right and you can't see it in the water (thats why I do boats and not big ships)((generally))
creations-chat 2023-04-14 15:14:35 you could make it work with better coloring- I just didn't get to it yet whenever I had the save
creations-chat 2023-04-14 15:33:05 honestly I think the bus looks good just take some screenies during the day and repost because I cannot see it
creations-chat 2023-04-14 15:39:38 It's bringing hell apon your shore
creations-chat 2023-04-14 15:45:57 do I not have it?
so I don't
oh well
creations-chat 2023-04-14 15:56:07 oh- of which one? and which rooms??
creations-chat 2023-04-14 16:02:33 ight give me like a day tho I'm heading to bed lmao
creations-chat 2023-04-14 22:28:29 Because it's an LST so I decided it's livery would be 666 as it's "bringing hell apon the shore"
creations-chat 2023-04-14 22:32:19 Running joke
I'm non binary
And while I'm generally pretty chill now and don't go around talking about it I think it's funny as hecc when you put pride flags on military builds because military enthusiasts get really really upset about it

Because it ruins the realism

As if the rest of the build is somehow ruined by 3 wing panels
creations-chat 2023-04-14 22:36:07 Oh ik I love it it's actually hilarious how triggered the server gets when the pretty boat I posts happens to have 4 pixels of the flag they aren't supposed to like
creations-chat 2023-04-14 22:58:23 Lol
creations-chat 2023-04-14 23:23:45 Fr lol
creations-chat 2023-04-14 23:32:19 the non binary republic of xe's nuts

does pitching it up still work?
creations-chat 2023-04-15 00:33:09 why's that?
creations-chat 2023-04-15 00:35:12 what exactly-  did they do to sounds? it's been quite a while for me since I have played.
creations-chat 2023-04-15 00:53:56 triggered pcc member moment
creations-chat 2023-04-15 01:02:16 screenshotted ❤️
creations-chat 2023-04-15 01:13:12 Absolutely! A lot of people on here are about to give you some super useless feedback and tear it apart-

dw about them
Ima give you some real advice on building better ships as you're clearly a new builder and I love making ships and helping new people with ships.

so for some quick things I noticed on your build specifically disconnectors can be used in place of where you have ladders to create a smooth look!
loose ropes are pretty ugly in builds- Instead use trails, set them to not appear and then use them to represent ropes and lines, you can get more complex by using motors to angle them!
Never use full white 
use something slightly below it on the RGB
it's hard to see your superstructure as it's just to bright to make out any of the shape

lastly here's some genuinely useful guides I've seen come out recently that I really wish were a thing when I was new 
the channels that posted them (because links are against the rules are)
-Aria ch.
 Advanced shipbuilding tutorials
-Uprising
Plane crazy ship building guide ep.1
creations-chat 2023-04-15 01:16:07 I have noticed most my ships that used to run fine like- legit do not run anymore I haven't even been able to show my kitakami because the game breaks when I try to load it
which sucks because it was my largest ship and had 40 launchable torpedoes lol
creations-chat 2023-04-15 01:22:49 you could say it's ***plane cra-*
creations-chat 2023-04-15 01:24:54 thats- longer then me- I've only been playing for just over 2
creations-chat 2023-04-15 01:27:41 my best build's save broke
no longer has it's coolest feature (the 40 launching and guiding deck fired torpedoes)
doesn't fold without breaking my game
and lags out because the game isn't updated
creations-chat 2023-04-15 01:33:42 fr it's so depressing I can't even show it here because it's just too broken and I didn't do anything. It also had a launching mouse pointed plane (that I could control from the ship and drop bombs with using no camera) and like- kitakami is an insane ship it was a crazy build and all of it was functional


like the boats on the back could be lowered and guided with my mouse
creations-chat 2023-04-15 01:35:43 but because first the save messed up
I no longer have the finished ship
So the torpedoes, aircraft and a lot of other bits are gone

and the whole thing no longer spawns in because plane crazy is broken
creations-chat 2023-04-15 01:37:50 that's significantly larger then anything I have ever done but maybe someday 
I'll keep it in mind
creations-chat 2023-04-15 01:41:25 god it's so pretty
creations-chat 2023-04-15 01:45:57 the complexity was insane-
there were 40 torpedoes on my build
each one is ship launched (meaning once it hits the water it has to restablize and balance) and guided once they hit the water by pointing my mouse at my target. the turrets on the side of the ship that fired the torpedoes were on motor 2s and the torpedoes fired 10 at a time giving me 10 launches per side not that side matters because they're guided anyways.
then there are the 4 deck guns you see on the front which have to sit along and under part of the super structure with 2 of them not hitting it.
and then near the aft several sets of anti air batteries.
along with the catapult which could be swung out over the side of the ship and launch a mouse pointed plane to go and bomb things

all gone


and this is why I stopped playing for a year
creations-chat 2023-04-15 01:49:59 No but like Its bs I'm still upset- I built a massive ship with stupid complexity for the sake of "this is to complex to work in plane crazy"
and then the game just deleted it :/

also mate I'm the least ego driven person in this server
I'm not talking this much because I like getting off to my builds (like ik you do)
I'm talking this much because I'm this autistic about this ship
it's a cool ship
creations-chat 2023-04-15 01:52:54 that build is ancient and I never finished it or it would have had more detail I'm sure.
creations-chat 2023-04-15 01:55:40 If your feedback is negative on principle your opinion means nothing 
you likely did not see my finished ship
mostly because I didn't work on the torpedo launchers in public servers I worked on them in a private friend server.
creations-chat 2023-04-15 01:59:11 like bro downvotes and is negative about everything and doesn't give helpful feedback 
holds an impossible and elitist standard to try and make a weird ingroup for what a "good build" is

and if you do that enough your opinion starts to not matter.

this is why PCC is laughed at by everyone else.
creations-chat 2023-04-15 02:02:23 Yeah- But I don't. and yet they have insisted my stuff is beneath consideration for some reason because it's elitism for elitism's sake. there is no respect for the builds for that person it's just about making a high standard. and all you have to do too not abide by it is keep posting cool ships

it's pretty goofy
creations-chat 2023-04-15 02:06:18 the 2 most recent ones are old and bad yep, the rest of my ships are good like ik my value this isn't an ego trip
creations-chat 2023-04-15 02:08:38 I'm actually not intrested in starting drama or getting banned so- silly me 🤭 Ima go-
creations-chat 2023-04-15 02:24:22 they have builds I like but most of them are ehhhhhh at best
I would never use a tutorial from them or anything- the simple style is just nice
creations-chat 2023-04-15 02:39:02 you border on harassment yk
creations-chat 2023-04-15 02:41:27 sigh- I give up
creations-chat 2023-04-15 04:08:53 only after being harrassed this much online for no reason -.-
creations-chat 2023-04-15 04:35:44 I don't know how to camera lock and like
We get it you have more experience in the Lego game
Stop fanning your balls over the trans person ya won already everyone here already agreed with ya
creations-chat 2023-04-15 05:01:04 and that other one that shall not be named
creations-chat 2023-04-15 06:17:02 I am so dumb I figured out a lot of the client side lag, so it turns out at some point hover engines were changed. and they used to be really good engines for small to medium boats as they could be stable below and above the surface and maintain one speed regardless of movement 

but now they lag your client based on block count and that- makes a lot of sense I need to gut a lot of engines to do some lag proofing : )
creations-chat 2023-04-15 07:11:33 I have like 4 in limbo of development for over a year I felt that
creations-chat 2023-04-15 07:34:55 oh lord
creations-chat 2023-04-15 08:08:14 "Problematic" = gay? or.. what
creations-chat 2023-04-15 10:12:21 I should be less nice- I'm litterally teaching this person how to build one of my turrets because I'm hoping it'll show them how motor locking can be used with small turret stuff
creations-chat 2023-04-15 23:35:37 <@770381790648467496> I am not a tank person by any means by I love your build! it has very good esthetic cohesion. Something most PCC "good" builds mess up
creations-chat 2023-04-15 23:38:51 like the cheiften build's colors do not match it's insane level of detail and because there is no difference in color you can't see a lot of the detail so it looks ugly

but got upvotes for having lots of motor lock? pcc has weird standerds
creations-chat 2023-04-15 23:48:15 The one in creations
creations-chat 2023-04-15 23:52:23 Like the stuff is impressive- but anyone can do it- why does it  have that many upvotes when it's color pallet is so low effort
creations-chat 2023-04-16 09:13:03 Kora class corvette
creations-chat 2023-04-16 09:53:10 That's the same build as one I already posted just at night with some cool angles- also 

no I will nawt
because It makes you mad personally :3
creations-chat 2023-04-16 09:55:17 well that flag is non binary so it has nothing to do with that anyways isn't that convenient!
guess It all worked out in the end.
creations-chat 2023-04-16 09:57:44 also nothing to do with who I prefer- you're clearly quite confused and I don't have time for you sorry not sorry
creations-chat 2023-04-16 10:01:55 I like it.

and it makes people like you come crying to me about it. which tells me automatically which people are safe to be around and talk to and which one's aren't.
I never have to ask "are you okay with trans people" because if they are they'll just say" nice build and if they aren't they'll start a mess in this channel

and when you are talking to another person it's usefull to know if they see you as a person from the start

TLDR
to make you upsetti spaghetti so I know I can stay th away from you :3
creations-chat 2023-04-16 10:06:40 nah it's the non binary flag and it makes bozos here super uncomfortable because they're awful people.

the fact is

all flags stand out that's kinda the point of a flag.
nobody would question any other changed flag
People don't like that the flag representing the minority they don't like is being posted more commonly then they'd like womp womp cry about it.
I make you guys upset about it on seeing it so I know to distance myself from you and it works.
creations-chat 2023-04-16 10:09:20 idc- it's not their build it's mine.
creations-chat 2023-04-16 10:15:19 no it does. normal people don't randomly ping me about it. only weirdoes and biggots do.
creations-chat 2023-04-16 10:18:06 I like it because it makes biggots mad. simple. when they are mad I can tell they are biggots and avoid them.
creations-chat 2023-04-16 10:21:15 This is actually toxic- drop the flag thing for a second can we cut it with the realism thing as a whole- realism looks bad in plane crazy's engine you can make build's look good esthetically but they are not going to be esthetically realistic
Also not all builds are going for realism
also also not all builds need too go to realism realism does not mean the build looks good 
the build looking good means the build looks good
if a tank is bright red but looks esthetically pleasing it's a good build. 
despite not being realistic
creations-chat 2023-04-16 10:26:19 well that I-400 wasn't finished
the flag would have had a frame and probably had the colors or mats changed to be duller

so I wouldn't say it right there was a good built it had potential to be good if I had kept detailing it the same way all my other ships
the fact the one example of a bad looking ship of mine you can point at is one that wasn't done is telling.
creations-chat 2023-04-16 10:28:41 it doesn't. at all. but the fact that you think it does ruins your value.
you wouldn't apply this scrutiny to any other flag lets be realll :3

you guys downvote it because you need to let everyone else know that being visibly non binary isn't okay and you think being non binary people are bad! which is biggoted!
And good for you- you signaling like this is nothing new it's called  a virtue signal. I make notes of who downvotes based on it consistently and move on :3
creations-chat 2023-04-16 10:32:47 Litterally I was assigned both at birth but pop off
creations-chat 2023-04-16 10:34:54 I love reporting people to discord for tos violations 
gotta be my fav activity
creations-chat 2023-04-16 10:37:45 no- pop off just means "but okay"

I have both sets of chromosomes and was born with parts of both and with both parts of my endocrinal systems. (which is what it's actually called there is no gendered "bone structure it's hormones and endocrines")
creations-chat 2023-04-16 10:39:46 so I am literally biologically both

ya'll actually skipped biology this isn't complicated https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersex
we're more common then red headed people
creations-chat 2023-04-16 10:46:54 biological gender (what you're assigned at birth) isn't binary you guys just need to actually open a book. it's bimodal. 
it's mostly polarized towards 2 ends with a great deal of stratification in the middle.
binary would mean 2 things.
and it definitely isn't that as I am living proof of
I would have developmentally been female (as all of you would have been) except instead of getting one more chromosome I got more and my body grew parts it shouldn't have. I got surgery to correct those parts but my body still makes testosterone from one internal nut and so I can't get pregnant and I don't have a chest. also I grow facial hair.
creations-chat 2023-04-16 10:59:11 Then what would you call me?
creations-chat 2023-04-16 11:04:06 Howso? I have both chromosomes, female male parts down there but no chest. 
I have male hormones and my endocreinal system fluctuates between a more male and female body meaning I can literally grow a mustache or lose it depending on the time of year
creations-chat 2023-04-16 11:07:04 I'm intersex it's both
But you said their's only 2 options because you don't think intersex people exist which like
creations-chat 2023-04-16 11:10:07 My existence literally makes your whole "there are only 2 gender thing" not work and you just don't have a solution to that 
You were so sure of it too lol :/
Rip
creations-chat 2023-04-16 11:15:55 that.. doesn't change anything. literally, I said I'm both. also nah google has okay info on it the problem is intersex is a broad term to refer to a broad range of experiences so like it's literally different for every intersex person
you're gonna get differing information just because of the sheer variety. even biological gender is complicated and there is so much in between the 2. your "basic biology" was actually "dumbed down biology" and you should take the time to look into the real thing it's pretty intresting
creations-chat 2023-04-16 12:56:18 this is known as the foxbat effect it is well documented
creations-chat 2023-04-16 14:25:39 Trying to get expert shipwright for my corvette and mods haven't responded  L
creations-chat 2023-04-16 14:28:48 You're not going to get anywhere by arguing with anyone who started by saying "your builds are bad look at my amazing builds"
Because they're an egotist 
Quit while you're ahead
creations-chat 2023-04-16 14:31:00 I'm helping you here.
creations-chat 2023-04-16 14:33:07 Actually nevermind carry on jef 🤭❤️
creations-chat 2023-04-16 14:35:13 Oh ik I was trying get them to shut up and take it as a win 
Because they're an idiot
🙄
creations-chat 2023-04-16 15:07:27 Why are none of the good members even remotely good at color or value theory
Like  I'm throwing shade it's annoying how bland the coloring on popular builds is
creations-chat 2023-04-16 15:12:10 No that's not what color and value theory is
It's just having a pallet and utilizing it to highlight the shape and details of your build regardless of real life coloring to draw the viewers eyes to the correct parts of it and make it look visually pleasing
Where as if the colors are too dark or similar or just one color with a lot of tiny details it can be visually confusing and noisy and a lot for the eyes to have to break up
Basically not as nice looking
This isn't conjecture this is art theory
creations-chat 2023-04-16 15:14:32 No that brings back noise and makes it look messy again

Also Jeff my corvette, coast guard boat and missile boat all have enough to have designer range votes and those are my most recent builds so idk what you mean.

creations-chat 2023-04-16 15:20:14 My dude you literally spend every waking moment in this channel insulting  every build you see for some reason I don't think you get to talk about ego drive out of nowhere
Like legit you just don't like anything that isn't your own
creations-chat 2023-04-16 15:22:18 Im not sitting here for another "creations chat dunk on fonnex for having trans flags on their  boat and daring to defend it" 
You can compare me to whoever
I'm out
creations-chat 2023-04-16 15:55:37 I already expressed it's never surprising
It's called a litmus test
It gets people to self report themselves as bigots

creations-chat 2023-04-16 17:36:36 "exposed locks" ppl moment
creations-chat 2023-04-16 17:41:41 my ships generally don't have any issues with looking bad because of them though. like when visible they don't detract anything. This idiot wants an excuse to to poke fun at my build tho so he's picking the exposed motor locks for some random part of my hull to poke at
the real point of that meme was hating the flags :/
creations-chat 2023-04-16 17:49:19 Yeah they did.
creations-chat 2023-04-16 18:10:29 intended??? I'm sorry intended by what lol naw intersex people just exist making it yes, a bimodal range. this is biology.
creations-chat 2023-04-16 18:14:38 yeah it was a slur.
Very funny
creations-chat 2023-04-16 18:18:14 so should I report you for the rule violation now or-
creations-chat 2023-04-16 18:20:22 builds containing derogatory language
creations-chat 2023-04-16 18:22:27 you've been being gross to me for days staff will do something.
also it obviously says a slur.
And I have my own screenshot.
creations-chat 2023-04-16 18:24:38 No literally. for 3 days. you guys are vile what did I do to you
creations-chat 2023-04-16 18:33:56 Like how is there only 2 when I'm literally right here in the middle. and then people try to argue that "well you're wrong thats not how biology works" okay I guess I'll just like- disappear" 
suddenly be born with XX cromosones rather then both in diffrent cells
creations-chat 2023-04-16 18:36:08 BRUHH JUST GOOGLE WHAT INTERSEX MEANS I CANT
I was born this way I didn't choose anything- I have both chromosomes I am both genders biologically
creations-chat 2023-04-16 18:40:28 it manifests differently in different intersex people so I have different chromosomes in different cells of my body

Also no- academia regards intersex as a gradient (bimodally) existing between male and female because each intersex condition is a different mutation  
not bad or wrong 
literally normal evolution like any other human body part we're normal people.
we're actually statistically more common then red headed people.
creations-chat 2023-04-16 18:42:30 oh yeah but so was every human trait at some point. that's all genetics.
creations-chat 2023-04-16 18:45:46 had nothing to do with them- 
gender identity is a separate thing (not a mental illness you illiterate)
my gender identity is non binary
creations-chat 2023-04-16 18:47:56 oh but we're not anomalies either that looks like a tiny amount of people but that's actually a lot- like statistically very significant 
also your original argument was that it was a defect. which it is not.
creations-chat 2023-04-16 18:50:14 no I think it started with the nonbinary flag this time 
I'm a silly lil intersex and ppl got curious abou it this morning
creations-chat 2023-04-16 18:58:25 lol that's so childish I literally did nothing what do you want from me

creations-chat 2023-04-25 12:31:54 Oh that's because I use default PC colors because I was being quick
I plan on dessating all the flags at some point like i had all my old alliance flags dessated 
They do look vibrant af rn
It bugs me to
I'll fix it
creations-chat 2023-04-25 12:35:27 But It should be noted
All the mfs here who constantly bitch about how I use them 
Don't actually care because they ruin the build 
Or they are unrealistic 
Or they are to repetitive
Or they don't match the vehlicles 
I've torn all these apart before
The real reason is they don't like non binary people being visible 
And a non binary person building good is to visible

This is why the last time it came up i got forever muted by someone's mod freind

creations-chat 2023-04-25 13:02:45 Given plane crazy is not stable (my best build a working 1-1  IJN kitakami with all 40 torpedoes and its aircraftcatapult launching)
Doesn't work anymore and I never got screenshots


That's why i post
creations-chat 2023-04-25 19:38:34 ugh creations chat harassing people who clearly have potential want to learn and are literally asking for feedback 🙄

Anyways

On future ships I'd recommend starting with the hull in a top down view from some blueprints too really try and get the shape down. Especially on battleships.
Because not many ships actually flatten out fully and without angle locking you will need to pay close attention to this shape.

Next is the color
Never use full white, you can get close to it but I can't make out a lot of your build because it's too bright to see. Tone down the color in the editor and it'll still look white but be easier to see. To further distinguish parts of the ship you should have several shades of white. 
The easiest way to do this is to take your main color into an online gradient generator and use that.
Then with all those shades you can have different parts of your superstructure stand out from each other just enough to all be made out from each other. 

And finally I think a lot more detailing in the hull deck area could do a lot of good for the build it looks fairly plain
creations-chat 2023-04-25 20:10:08 No <:m_:778994206948589638>
creations-chat 2023-04-25 20:12:10 Why not paint the engines?
Definitely some interesting choices
creations-chat 2023-04-25 20:19:44 These things 
I want them to raise up from the deck and fire as a real one would

Should I use the in game rocket or try to make some form of actual missile loader with magnets or smith
https://youtu.be/0Xwpgf3CeXg
For the record its meant to go on this
creations-chat 2023-04-25 20:22:55 The person litterally asked for the feedback :/
creations-chat 2023-04-25 20:27:02 They said thank-you for it

creations-chat 2023-04-26 00:39:35 TRU blame roblox for that the game's running fine it's their recording
I'm on a laptop that cannot handle screencap so ya'll get the roblox slideshow
creations-chat 2023-04-26 00:42:35 yes and every build without one is made by a coward
creations-chat 2023-04-26 01:33:50 
creations-chat 2023-04-26 13:33:00 Coming back to 4 pings I won't read 🤭
creations-chat 2023-04-27 13:11:35 my hot take is that if they wanted to revive game activity and server activity- making HOF 100 votes again would go a long way
it's not about upholding a standard it's about maintaining a community and this game's is so bad fr fr
creations-chat 2023-04-27 14:11:19 yeah there would be a huge spike of entries at first but after it cooled off it'd be pretty good I think
creations-chat 2023-04-27 14:57:09 Nah honey it's dead because you don't highlight when cool things are posted which discourages people from posting cool things.
It's dead because ideas aren't shared to new people
it's just assumed you should have them
we don't share  good builds or ideas for others to take inspiration we share them to set a standard which locks those 'bad' players out
creations-chat 2023-04-27 15:05:53 more would be made if we did a good job highlighting the few
and we don't
or like encouraging anyone to do anything who is even remotely below the bar
creations-chat 2023-04-27 16:26:11 that's been done it's called blacklist

if a submarine player ever blacklists you just give up they know your IP and there is already a torpedo inside of your colin
creations-chat 2023-04-27 16:28:25 good submarine players are like- the ULTRA rares of pc tho
like danm we died off
creations-chat 2023-04-27 16:30:54 it's kinda pointless- any ship big enough for this to make sense it makes more sense to just use guided or jumping torpedoes to take it out 
which is nice 
also break apart torpedoes work stupid well too
basically it doesn't have much use as it'd be to specific
creations-chat 2023-04-27 16:34:26 the most complicated torpedoes are aircraft dropped spiral torpedoes but they work too well it's so unfair
creations-chat 2023-04-27 16:38:52 I wish the build detect bug worked for torpedoes because then you could make area of denial homing torpedoes or mines and it'd be pretty great
Wouldn't make sense on current map but none of this does I just like the functionality of it all
creations-chat 2023-04-27 17:26:11 I don't think flairs would work as well as some kind of chaff would 
Like a bomb of exploadable material behind you that keeps you safe from the missile
creations-chat 2023-04-27 17:39:03 not at all-
creations-chat 2023-04-28 02:31:12 I need to see it painted to judge honestly
obviously it looks bad when all we can see is the wedges
creations-chat 2023-04-28 04:24:35 I am on redesign 3 of my mystery boats aft deck
Anyone got any functioning depth charge racks?
creations-chat 2023-04-28 13:49:12 People down voted the torpedo? Why lol it does exactly what it's meant too
creations-chat 2023-04-28 13:51:42 
creations-chat 2023-04-28 13:54:19 Idk what else they could be down voting on tho like it was just a showcase of them
creations-chat 2023-04-28 13:56:44 Bruh fr what is your problem with me
creations-chat 2023-04-28 14:03:28 I've done 2 posts on this boat
It's a wip


And it's because historically it takes me months of procrastination for builds to be finished
But I like posting actively
creations-chat 2023-04-28 14:13:38 Well none of thes have been showcases of the ship
I already did that
It's been showcases of other stuff that launches from it that I didn't get to post with the original ship because I'd of been to long and you'd of complained about that
creations-chat 2023-04-28 14:17:27 Well the torpedoes are done
And I was posting the torpedoes 
Because they're neat 

Also I'm deleting the I-400 post I'm tired of it getting used whenever someone wants to show an example of my ships

Because legit it was a build I posted Because I was never going to finish it
Was incredibly unfinished
And while I explained all that all the context goes away when people post it with "this is their bad ships" bruh no it is not you mfs pick my worst build I've done to show like I also wasn't happy with the I-400 thats why I stopped working on it
creations-chat 2023-04-28 14:21:14 No but fr sorry my flag (meant to be a highly visible symbol representing the identity of the nation operating the ship) was to visible 

I don't identity with japan Russia or India so I don't put their flags on my shit.
They are all awfull countries. 
But I do identify with that flag and they're my ships.
Idk why people complain about flags being high visibility like it's not the point of a flag
creations-chat 2023-04-28 14:24:40 Oh idc about what countries did in the past that's stupid
I don't like Japan because they're a racist ethnostate
I don't like India because they're government is fascistic which sucks because India is MASSIVE like stupid big and not covered enough 
And I don't like Russia for the same reason just turn it up times 10
creations-chat 2023-04-28 14:33:29 True! Countries are dumb
Hence why I don't put their flags on my labors ifgaf about them
creations-chat 2023-04-28 14:51:23 Bruh tf do I do like fr
I post a lot and it's the same build 
But always showing off some smaller system on the build like launching missiles or smth because I give all my ships little recoverable boats and drones and shit and then don't get to post them with the build because it's be to big of a post and yall hate that too

Am I just the worst for being a loud gay and posting frequently?
creations-chat 2023-04-28 14:56:20 What
K now I'm confused
creations-chat 2023-04-28 15:05:06 No I thought he was attacking me
Like- he was
Then he backed off for some reason
creations-chat 2023-04-28 15:09:16 Bruh just kick ppl like this from the Chat fr this mf gives no feedback

Also this is actual unde behavior
creations-chat 2023-04-28 15:20:52 Icky
K
So
You're point is dumb
I'm not pushing anything
I'm posting same as anyone else 
My ships have a flag that represent me but it's not being pushed on you its just a symbol I like being on my ships.
creations-chat 2023-04-28 15:23:49 Nah
Nothing about my identity should be a secret
This is literally just "well you can be gay just stay in the closet"
creations-chat 2023-04-28 15:25:54 I should also point out rq for everyone snickering along with morfix
They don't care about any of this It's super disingenuous 
They just like harassing me and have made this very very clear
creations-chat 2023-04-28 15:28:15 No not really
You don't have to look at my ship lol
 But it is mine
And I can put whatever I want on it 
It isn't an attack or forcing you to do anything 
Again this is the "you can be gay as long as you're quiet about it and stay in the closet" shit 
You just don't like it when you have to see non binary people and that's not my problem
creations-chat 2023-04-28 15:32:38 No but like think about it for a second 
What is the goal here from this idiot
He doesn't want to see non binary flags on builds in his game
Which okay maybe you're fine with
But let's go with it and say I deleted all the flags
Nobody posts pride builds nothing
It's a completely gay free game that isn't "pushing anything down his throat"
It starts to look like non binary people just don't play the game
Or aren't allowed too without keeping themselves in the closet

That's what I meant
It's the same idea that he's pushing and it's ick
creations-chat 2023-04-28 15:39:27 Like when you actually break down his position it's 

"People shouldn't post pride flags in creations and expect anything other then harrasment"

If you want me to stop posting the flags it starts to look like non binary people either don't exist or aren't allowed to post here
And that's where we're at

That's your solution is I delete 6 wing panels before taking screenshots of my build snd PCC doesn't have Lgbtq builds posted because it would be shoving them down your throat 
And what's revealing is that this position literally just means you don't think non binary builds are okay
You would rather have this big argument every time I post then see 6 wing panels
creations-chat 2023-04-28 15:41:41 Hey I'm never the one who starts it

Unless you count posting a build as being not allowed because it'll cause drama 
All I do is post and get shit for it for days
creations-chat 2023-04-28 15:44:22 You're right
Except for when I want a flag on my build 
I already explained why I don't use country flags I think they're dumb
Why would I credit fucking India for my build idc if they made the original ship 30 years ago I spent hours making this one
I wouldn't use any countries flags they don't represent me or the effort I put into it
So when I want a flag I use ones that do represent me

It's a creative choice
That's all it is and because its over the game I'm posting about it does have something to do with it
creations-chat 2023-04-28 15:46:29 None of this is to push anything on anyone else
If you're tired of seeing it you're just tired of seeing non binary people and like idk how to fix that??
creations-chat 2023-04-28 15:49:44 None of this is contradictory to what I said earlier
Both are true
I put it there for my own reasons
And also the only reason they gave a problem with it is homophobia/transpobia 

That said idc about downvotes or criticism I'm happy to explain again and again why they are there and all the reasons I like them being on my builds and all that

But mfs really dm gore and shit over this
Like the harassment is insane every time I post anything 
My torpedoes didn't even have a flag because they were on an unfinished build and people downvoted them just over not liking me
creations-chat 2023-04-28 15:51:47 Debate isn't about convincing your opponent it's about putting on a show to move over your audience to your position
You know this too
Don't pretend anything I could say would make you less mentally ill
I was arguing your points to break them down for everyone else's benefit you're a lost cause 

Now stop trying to start shit with everyone fr
creations-chat 2023-04-28 15:55:08 I explained it's relivence and why they're there and you agreed
This "it shouldn't be there it has nothing to do with the game" doesn't work anymore you conceded it has to do with the game because it's a sandbox game and my creative choice in it .
I don't need more reason then that. 
And the moment you accept that you then have to turn and go "wait so why is everyone upset at a lack of reason if they didn't need one" and the answer becomes pretty obvious
creations-chat 2023-04-28 15:57:16 I actually did I spent 3 whole messages breaking it down
They just weren't directed at you because as you've kindly demonstrated you're too fucking mentally ill to read them
creations-chat 2023-04-28 15:59:20 Bro don't engage with them think for a second

All flags are pride flags you don't fly a flag you're not proud of like what
They're just arguing to start shit don't take the bait
creations-chat 2023-04-28 16:01:29 It won't be the last one this happens every time I post 
My last 2 posts didn't even have flags they only came up because morfix is obsessed with harassing me over them and will bring them up every time if nobody else does 
Hence why he started this
creations-chat 2023-04-28 16:03:59 Gay people can be transphobic like him 
Lgbtq people aren't monolithic and he's not special


Also yes I only make boats because 1. Autism and 2. I don't actually play too often and it takes a while. Plus all my boats are capital F functional so they're usually like 4 vehicles in 1 build and it takes a while
creations-chat 2023-04-28 16:07:33 That's so many ppl here Tho it's unde shit I hate it because actual debate will be going on and there will be 2 of these mfs doing nothing but flinging their own shit on the wall
creations-chat 2023-04-28 16:15:02 Bro is also flinging shit on the wall and thinking literally anyone else cares like bruh is going ape mode in the bathroom and nobody out here in the real world is effected by your mental breakdown 
Stop trying to start shit back up its that easy
Unde fr
creations-chat 2023-04-28 16:17:04 Stop engaging he's arguing in bad faith
He doesn't believe in anything or know what he's talking about he just likes arguing for the attention
creations-chat 2023-04-28 16:19:08 I'm calling you mentally ill because you're still going and it makes you look mentally ill

Unde behavior fr
creations-chat 2023-04-28 16:21:12 Visby class corvette needs a Sombrero and i will not explain

Side note should I do a visby
Like do you think it's something people would like in my more cartoon looking style of build
Because I already have the turret, side panels missile systems and torpedoes developed there is pretty much nothing I'd need to develop for it just angle lock everything into a pretty hull
creations-chat 2023-04-28 16:24:30 Exactly
creations-chat 2023-04-28 16:26:53 Also I think I could nail the paint because most modern stealth warships in the game are painted badly so you can't make out details and just look trash
But I've done a build in the pallet before and it looked pretty good I think (not my best but yk)
creations-chat 2023-04-28 16:29:45 Wow original hottake from morfix how observant 


Chat already moved on from the last argument you started about this literally you do this every time I do anything
creations-chat 2023-04-28 16:32:51 Again going back to weird undes who start shit for literally no reason

Morfix everyone
He started the last argument and stepped away when it was going
The moment it ended and I wasn't kicked out of chat he is trying to start another one
creations-chat 2023-04-28 16:42:36 I'm putting a visby on my list of consideration vehicles (like I don't have 2 ships to do rn)

Part of me dies every time a really nice build is harmed by the use of either too dark or too bright of colors
It's not that hard white looks bad
Solid colors look bad
You have to tone them down because the game has no lighting 
That's just what it is
creations-chat 2023-04-28 21:07:53 No I was referring to the Canadian plane

But no also all these tanks I can't see detail on because the paint us all one color is just as upsetting
Yall spent hours getting that one armor plate to sit right on the hull of a tank just to blend it all together because you paint it the same color
I don't get it
creations-chat 2023-04-28 21:16:10 Oh yeah it's got other issues
But it'd be infinitely better if I could see the shapes on it
creations-chat 2023-04-28 21:19:36 Also I want to be clear
That person is obviously pretty new I'm not interested in talking too much about their plane it's just fine 
Anyways 
White can look fine like you can pull it off
Just not 250 250 250
It has to be lower and with a tint contrasting your other color
creations-chat 2023-04-28 21:24:21 The TNT locking ----> extreme elitist "I only play in private server because all public servers have cringe Whitename builds" pipeline is real 
What fun is there in being alone in a server where nothing weird can happen
creations-chat 2023-04-28 21:32:02 Cringe 
Pcc elitism fr
creations-chat 2023-04-28 21:37:41 I'm at dinner rn but I've argued about it before 
Tldr plane crazy community uses private servers, ranks and whatnot to form ingroups a vast majority of players will never be a part of
And cannot possibly get into
When all the best people in the community lock themselves in boxes with other "only good players'' it stifles the community over time
This isn't that apparent anymore but it was so bad in like 2021
creations-chat 2023-04-28 21:43:00 I still want to make a Functional blimp that can effectively hunt submarines
Nothings stopping me I have the torpedoes now
It'd literally just be another project
creations-chat 2023-04-28 23:40:36 how is guided "lock on" missile stuff not more used it's not that hard
hoverthrusters push away from people and builds
just translate the force of a hoverthruster into an inverse on your missile (this sounds harder then it is) and it'll fallow anything it gets close enough for the hover to interact with
creations-chat 2023-04-28 23:43:05 hoverthrusters
they exhert force from other builds
you just invert it for your control surfaces to your missile
creations-chat 2023-04-28 23:45:12 I'm not about to give out my personal guided missile designs but it's just motors and text idk why people act like it's a mystery
creations-chat 2023-04-28 23:49:55 Well this is what gets me
they don't exist on yt
the whole PCC seems to act like it's lost tech
but it feels kinda obvious. and its something that SHOULD be used more like my ships have CIWS that locks onto builds if they get close enough on their own and why does nobody else use them this way
creations-chat 2023-04-28 23:54:29 hoverthrusters
creations-chat 2023-04-29 00:17:11 <@963907500523003996> what are you using as shaders?
creations-chat 2023-04-29 02:16:39 Not my dumbass spending 20 minutes creating working "depth charge racks" only to realize I have too redo the whole thing because I can't lock the build with loose physics objects or they clip out
creations-chat 2023-04-29 02:20:32 ew-
creations-chat 2023-04-29 02:40:48 so uh- it turns out the interior layout of this ship was some rather poor planning on my part- if you happen to blow up one of these torpedoes they have a pretty good chance at destroying the core that holds the super structure to the hull, either 1 of 4 hull plates (depending on the torpedo hit) and without my superstructure the boat has no anti air- which was limited before but is severely limited now
and no forward gun

it can also take out the understructure for the other 4 torpedo launchers

hitting this boat with an explosive will fully disable it-
this isn't too bad- like It just means any type of air threat is massively dangerous but as a fleet guard vessel it's okay-
idk I'm pretty unhappy with it but I cannot do much to fix it without redoing half the boat again
creations-chat 2023-04-29 03:23:57 no.
creations-chat 2023-04-29 03:36:23 It's called autism <:m_:778994206948589638>
creations-chat 2023-04-29 03:38:47 I use this as my pfp I already won the unflattering images contest when it comes to me lol
creations-chat 2023-04-29 03:41:11 Yall need someone to pick on who's actually bothered by it fr
I'm a bad candidate 
I just argue or shitpost back in turn 

Also we stan the live performance radish spirit he is perfect
creations-chat 2023-04-29 04:12:10 -'Relic' class (actual ship class is a secret as of rn)
-Status incomplete 
-role ASW and limited surface engagement 
-weopons and deployables 
×1 single rocket turret mouse pointed
×1 5 gun CIWS guided by mouse and build track on
×4 "drooper" anti submarine mouse guided torpedoes 
×(undecided) depth charges launched from stern 

The "relic" class is (not its final name) is a ship still in development from an older time- when it was assumed that PC2 would be out soon, have a new map and larger servers and that on this new map ships would be used pretty frequently due to lag reduction.
It was assumed by the alliance I was in that fleets of pvp ships would be possible
And as we saw it there were 2 threats to any grouping of ships 
Air and submarine 
This is one of 3 vehicles I was asked to make to deter submarines
The other one (being a bouy tender capable of deploying torpedo nets I haven't shown off yet but do work) was the shield of this would be fleet and this was the sword
creations-chat 2023-04-29 04:14:12 Tldr this ship I'm about to finish is going to A
not be useful against anything above the water including aircraft and thus be absolutely unplayable alone
And B
Not make sense in plane crazy anymore
But I still want my functional ASW boat dammit
creations-chat 2023-04-29 04:31:03 "What if we did missiles but.. wrong"
creations-chat 2023-04-29 04:33:09 Nah but this is an awesome concept if I made airships old enough I would so use these
creations-chat 2023-04-29 13:56:22 And that's valid until people just... never left them
Again this isn't as bad anyone but it used to be

-K class blimp
-I-400
-Sarancha class hydrofoil 
-kitakami 
-G-38

All unfinished but builds I wish I could eventually finish
Like the I-400 I had planned is cool
It had working aircraft to go bomb stuff controlled with my mouse 
But like I will never have the inspiration to finish it
Also PCC loved shitting on it as if  a half finished ship as if it's all my ships sm that I literally have no aspiration to work on it
creations-chat 2023-04-30 04:33:52 Most of these are broken when I spawn them now tho

My body makes testosterone so i grow more facial hair idk what you want
creations-chat 2023-04-30 05:00:23 I've made more ships then anything else

creations-chat 2023-04-30 22:15:01 oh shit they broke hovers
I was working on a K class blimp and the plan was to have it's gun both lock onto builds and also automatically steer the blimp to them by doing this (which I could disengage to take manual control of both parts ofc)

but they broke my method of making hover thrusters lock onto ppls builds
creations-chat 2023-05-01 04:21:10 
creations-chat 2023-05-01 04:54:19 that tank is neither gay nor trans
bro didn't even do the flag right
creations-chat 2023-05-01 07:02:12 I started a new thing- kinda random but it's coming great so far
creations-chat 2023-05-01 07:08:40 The most interesting period of airship history when they were used stupid effectively to just ass German u boats 
And like are still being considered for submarine hunting today because they were just that good at it
creations-chat 2023-05-01 08:08:42 I'm going to keybind them to turn on when acending (as according to the old manuals I've been reading through to work on it they would be pumping air out of the envelope to go up, and pumping in air to go down
Air being heavier then helium which the rest of the envelope is full of)
creations-chat 2023-05-01 08:13:49 It's actually pretty cool I have a pretty good understanding of how this type of blimp works now
And I'm hoping to make mine control and feel similarly 
It's weopons are already pretty spot on are It's engines
And the door up where because the whole thing sits diagonally on its landing  gear you can just climb into the back of the ship

Also texture on missiles and bombs

creations-chat 2023-05-02 03:54:01 hey you don't gotta argue with this loser- he's arguing bad faith and just likes starting fights with ppl
don't feed his nonsense
creations-chat 2023-05-02 03:58:12 I have been, and you're right but you are also continuing an argument in this chat for no other reason then you like to argue and insult ppl
and I cannot stand that ❤️
creations-chat 2023-05-02 04:00:14 okay but like why do you care this much tho let him realize he's wrong on his own-
creations-chat 2023-05-02 04:03:15 you just conceided  you're just here to argue and insult- which is my problem with you :/

creations-chat 2023-05-02 04:47:56 they just broke auto guided missiles smh
creations-chat 2023-05-02 04:50:25 That was me last year but then I tried to oof myself and got depressed so now I am back into the silly lego game 🐱
creations-chat 2023-05-02 13:18:44 His build is too long and narrow to be a tampon (they're spongey and expand to be wide)
creations-chat 2023-05-02 17:14:49 Ow
creations-chat 2023-05-02 17:29:47 Makes it useless even as a tampon
creations-chat 2023-05-02 17:46:41 What if you made the kowloon walled city
creations-chat 2023-05-02 17:49:07 
creations-chat 2023-05-02 17:54:38 1:1 is dumb
I like aiming for just above ro-scale to make it feel good to walk around
I do ships tho I think roscale tanks are pretty cool
Helis too
Jets are whatever
creations-chat 2023-05-02 17:57:13 India has nothing on kowloon
creations-chat 2023-05-02 18:03:39 
creations-chat 2023-05-02 18:05:44 Oh no
Soviet architecture was good, pre planned and cranked out of an assembly line to recover from the war


This city grew organically in an international legal no man's land
These were informal tenements or "slums" stacked onto each other 

Did you guys really not no about this? It was the densest city in history
creations-chat 2023-05-02 18:11:24 Oh yeah it was great
You gotta consider that what came before soviet apartment blocks was a patchwork of feudalism
Where you could have a city house with running water and electricity 
And then drive 10 minutes out to the countryside and get houses with 3 families living in one room and no glass windows

And then this situation was made worse by WW2
Which raised housing across Europe 

The ability to factory build apartments that were very much so better then the single room shacks people were living in (if that) from before was a good move in affordable housing
The soviet union was bad but like  infrastructure was good
They're only seen as bad now because the context of what came before them isn't shown


Also all of them were built in like 3 years which is very very impressive
creations-chat 2023-05-02 18:13:30 Oh yeah Kowloon was real it was insane
It probably shouldn't have been raised but yk British gotta British 
Like they just deleted a city that had been built up from nothing with no government or nothing
Good going
creations-chat 2023-05-02 18:25:05 Don't compare it to other stuff just go look into it it's more insane then any of that it's a genuinely impressive city we just deleted
creations-chat 2023-05-02 18:32:03 Well the "commie block" has been replicated in most places
Like the US and UK have them
And they probably should it's such an efficient way to build affordable housing
creations-chat 2023-05-02 18:35:14 As per usual france and Germany did it the best by bringing in mixed zoning to the whole concept which makes it much better
creations-chat 2023-05-02 18:38:29 Well no- they're full houses 
Better then what people lived in before the war 
Like beyond better 
Even if they were boxes that's not the worst in terms of affordable housing
Kowloon was just boxes stacked on boxes and it was a very functional city 
It was completely organic and impoverished by the nature of its existence 
But it's housing worked 
Ex residents remember the city fondly and miss it
creations-chat 2023-05-02 19:07:36 It was destroyed in the 90s most people alive rn were alive when it was destroyed
creations-chat 2023-05-02 19:12:29 It- wasn't tho
Drugs and unlicensed doctors aren't necessarily bad
The doctors existed there because there was a market of poor people who were desperate for Healthcare 
Thats a net good
And Drug money funded so much of that city like it ended up ran by the triads
They set up pension funds and nursing homes and schools
Basically took over as a kind of police
So like yes it was worse then living in your comfy American suburban house
But like these were poor people (a lot of refugees from china and the UK both) and they literally built a city to live in because now where else was affordable 
It's impressive
creations-chat 2023-05-02 19:15:04 That's because there have been 3 cod maps set there :/

Yall are so privileged oml homeless settlements aren't going to be pretty to you it's poverty fucking duh

What's impressive is how well it functiobed as a city with no oversight or regulations 
It was just a massive community and it probably would have kept along fine
creations-chat 2023-05-02 19:17:24 It was made by an actual postal worker in the city
That's right the city had postal workers someone organized at some point
And God help them
creations-chat 2023-05-02 19:20:00 Anyone who sees this as anything other then an impressive demonstration of human enguinity and tenacity.
Is horribly privileged and has never been starving before fr fr
creations-chat 2023-05-02 19:24:01 Man this logic would make everything bad
Cars are bad under this logic
Breathing is bad

What you're going to breath? You'll just stub your toe in 10 minutes you fucking idiot why breath when it'll just allow for more problems 

Bro is stupid fr
creations-chat 2023-05-02 19:27:12 You just gonna ignore the part where I explained why you're stupid
Resorting to insults implies I used them with no bases
But I made it pretty clear how you're argument makes no sense 

That's not my logic I'm breaking down why it's dumb when you do it 
This is unde levels of arguing
creations-chat 2023-05-02 19:29:43 Nah love ad hominem means using insults in place of an argument to devalue previous arguments
You made a bad previous argument
I responded to it with an argument and then insulted you for how bad your argument is

There's a difference between the two.

You wanna pull out any other debate terms you don't know shit about?
creations-chat 2023-05-02 19:31:49 Lol okay I'm done talking to 12yos I got work bye CChat
creations-chat 2023-05-02 19:37:26 Isn't that from the one guy who they tracked down by finding the grain of granite in his countertop tracing it back to a quarry and then seeing where it was shipped too
creations-chat 2023-05-02 19:40:06 Wait I need to read up on it I don't think I got that right
creations-chat 2023-05-02 19:43:33 NO LOL I WAS RIGHT
Bro leaked them to impress his nasee discord server 
And the government found him by tracking down the granite countertop he took the pictures on
creations-chat 2023-05-02 20:00:46 Nah it was the granite counter top 
The US state department is just that wild
creations-chat 2023-05-02 20:09:58 that's kinda nice ngl I like the detail on the interior bits
creations-chat 2023-05-02 20:12:11 May I recommend some texturing on the exterior of the gondola? maybe some disconnectors or ladders just to break up all the smooth surfaces
creations-chat 2023-05-02 20:14:27 something like this where the boxyness is more connected to the envelope to kinda explain it's shape
creations-chat 2023-05-02 20:30:41 
creations-chat 2023-05-02 21:13:41 No ik I'm saying the framing on the outside of the boxy bits

creations-chat 2023-05-03 06:23:53 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savoia-Marchetti_S.55Ik this is gonna seem weird- but I looking for a build and found this message- and as Italian ww1-2 aircraft are my favorite I figured I should inform you this was a real plane actually and it's very pretty
creations-chat 2023-05-03 06:25:59 YES best plane- best plane ever omg 
never has a plane existed that at all compares
creations-chat 2023-05-03 06:48:55 I wish I was confident enough at how to set up cam lock builds to try and start a G-38
it really is the coolest airplane
creations-chat 2023-05-03 06:51:19 like ik how it works- and I use it on builds but idk how to structure builds with it yk- like I don't know how to make a big shape with it just add shapes 
It's still new to me tho so hopefully that changes 
Im in a pit rn because Idk how to do rounded off shapes with angle lock
and Im making a blimp where that's kinda important
creations-chat 2023-05-03 16:37:22 Do the missiles work?
creations-chat 2023-05-03 16:39:25 Dam shame

creations-chat 2023-05-03 16:53:37 Eskeline moment
creations-chat 2023-05-03 16:56:07 This is based

creations-chat 2023-05-03 18:02:23 Yall flightpoint is weird
It's taking me a while but I'm working on a Ca-3 (it was my first ever plane crazy plane so it seems fitting)
creations-chat 2023-05-03 18:04:25 You can use hallow cillenders as planetary rings properly to make old ww1 style machine gun mounting on aircraft
Which is so cool 
Like actually being able to sit in the center of your machine gun mount and have it rotate around you is cool
creations-chat 2023-05-03 19:08:45 Fucking weirdo any anylizing my pfp
Bro is parisocial yk I don't think about you as much as you do me right
Fr get a better hobby then trying to harrass me for attention
creations-chat 2023-05-04 18:46:09 Yall I might quit plane crazy flightpoint Is that much funner
creations-chat 2023-05-04 18:48:12 You gotta kinda cheese it
But you can make shit invisible 
Also I'm doing big Caproni biplanes because I like them
So they're more stable by default
creations-chat 2023-05-04 18:52:53 Like It's not as intuitive as plane crazy
But plane crazy flying is also ass we're just used to that too 
There are some major issues like that I can seem to get torpedoes or missiles not to freeze after launch
creations-chat 2023-05-04 18:55:08 Its- just modeling
I'm a professional artist working in triangles is so much more intuitive then blocks
That's literally how all 3D models work
Meaning BTW you can kinda copy over wire frames of models directly
creations-chat 2023-05-04 18:57:18 Not even a good flightpoint build ew th is that
creations-chat 2023-05-04 19:02:51 There was a mirror- it was a just broken
It should come back also you don't even need to use triangles (at least for biplanes) I've used more wedges and beams then anything else on mine
And while it's not done yet it looks really good af and is way funner to figure out and work on then plane crazy
creations-chat 2023-05-04 19:05:03 I think what I like so much is that I can know when my shit breaks
It won't be broken forever
Like my ships aren't going to stop working and never get fixed because of a lazy dev 

That said there is no ballast tank yet- and while I got a small test sub to work it was less then ideal
Not to mention custom missiles/torpedoes do nawt work yet
creations-chat 2023-05-04 19:07:08 I did too 
I'm on like my forth try at it
Definitely took some getting used too
creations-chat 2023-05-04 19:09:28 
creations-chat 2023-05-04 19:12:03 Get in an argument in gen chat 
You'll have it in no time
creations-chat 2023-05-04 19:14:09 We all just saw morfix do one and the quality drop is- telling
creations-chat 2023-05-04 19:17:02 Tru you not gonna get anything positive from this chat specifically 
It will nawt happen
creations-chat 2023-05-04 19:19:53 Honey it do be facts

We don't do positive feedback here
creations-chat 2023-05-04 19:22:34 Okay but like
They rite tho
Thus chat will just harass new ppl with the stated intention of getting them go leave the community 
There is never any betterment of anyone just harassment 

Like maybe staff should uh
Do something to stop that pattern of behavior idk
creations-chat 2023-05-04 19:24:53 
creations-chat 2023-05-04 19:27:09 Oh no I agree
But it is taken too far like the goal is often stated to make people leave and that's kinda elitist and gross
Yall we spend our time wasting our life with roblox we not about to have any ground to stand on when it comes to trying to kick people out
Like this trashhole does not need to be gatekept but ppl act like they are the arbiters of build quality
creations-chat 2023-05-04 19:29:29 Nah love you can't use the gif if the joke A wasn't written as a pre established joke and B wasn't funny
These are the rules I don't make them
creations-chat 2023-05-04 19:31:38 Samee
I have a quirky ass building style and people frequently get on it for having exposed lock I clearly didn't care to or even Try hiding 
Like I'm not going to care
(That or they attack me for that other thing)
creations-chat 2023-05-04 19:52:51 It's mostly the other thing
But I don't actually repost
Like ik people say I do
The problem is its always something on a build being shown off that I haven't shown off before
It's pretty much just the other thing
The reposting only comes up because they don't like how often they have to see it and would prefer never too
