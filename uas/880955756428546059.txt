bug-reports 2021-08-29 17:39:37 i was flying around my space craft and when i tried to fire my missiles, they dissapeared instantly, if i join another server it doesnt fix it, if i change accounts it doesnt fix it, i have a good computer so i dont understand why this is happening
bug-reports 2021-08-29 17:40:15 all i can use are my guns because my missiles dont hit anything at all and seemingly vanish when fired
bug-reports 2021-08-29 20:33:14 about 500 when going down, but average cruise speed is 400, a week ago the rockets worked perfectly fine, i have modified it at all
the-dump 2021-08-29 20:47:10 fire two more times just to be sure.

bug-reports 2021-08-30 06:06:15 not so much as a glitch that happens randomly but a more understandable glitch that is self caused, i own a conveyor drive that i made myself, it can get up to 30k speed in 0.5 seconds, and even faster if i continue holding it, the ship i use this on has turrets, of course i found a way around this issue but imma still post it anyways, basically when i hold it for 2 seconds (i gain about 70k speed) and anchor to stop myself (i use a anchor block to accurately stop myself at my destination) sometimes the turret motors do a strange vortex and launch off, they seem to spin very fast and very far away, when they hit anything it causes my ship to be unflyable and spin out of control, this is prob gonna be fixed eventually in plane crazy 2 tho
bug-reports 2021-08-30 06:07:43 dont bother responding to this saying "theres no true way to solve this reliably" because i know this, i just want people to dm me funni clips of their ships doing the **p a r a c h u t e  d a n c e**
