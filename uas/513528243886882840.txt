creations-chat 2020-11-12 02:17:36 what should I add to it? (my monorail, yes)
creations-chat 2020-11-12 02:19:56 ok, thanks
creations-chat 2020-11-12 02:22:58 > if more realism add more poles or idk what they are called
<@!659514717496147969> poles would pretty much block other player bases and cause more annoyance
creations-chat 2020-11-13 11:55:11 what should I improve on my boeing 737-700?

creations-chat 2021-06-14 16:19:23 after viewing your unamusing arguments, I'd say your antics bore me

I still own the right to use an anime pfp (although this pfp is more to a meme pfp)

The general reason why people use this channel is due to the fact people want to know what they did wrong or are just curious about what people think of their build.
creations-chat 2021-06-14 16:23:09 "Albert is an unde" is an opinion, not a fact üòé ok let's not continue stuff and just move on ok
creations-chat 2021-06-14 16:29:07 ok legit stop, this chat is legit becoming a toxic wasteland bruh. People can have opinions, but try not to offend people with it. Let's call an anti-climax pls
creations-chat 2021-06-14 16:31:38 probably gpu, but I don't mind tbh.

pls, anti-climax, just stop toxifying this chat
creations-chat 2021-06-14 16:34:27 ok how about this, https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/384025409945337856/840237501867360256 is there anything I can do with my build?

mlitary, body looks fine (I'm not into jets tbh)

kokamy, ok

creations-chat 2021-10-18 13:34:58 a huge landmass only for buses and taxis to stop

Why put trash, it's literally a bus terminal üóø

sorry, but we can't do that. We might make a copy for that one purpose tho

I don't think it can be bigger
creations-chat 2021-10-18 14:39:17 - I'd recommed adding camo
- add details on barrel
- Texture
other than that, it's fine

creations-chat 2021-10-25 15:12:29 a random photoshoot I did with my bus (bus stop buy <@!324815581368811520> )

bot-central 2022-02-20 11:07:08 ok when remove from database
creations-chat 2022-03-04 00:15:29 would recommend adjusting the wheel well. Also get stuff painted. use propellers as wheels (deactivate them). Also since it's a truck, perhaps make the top part one block tall instead of 0.5

any time, this channel is literally cancer
creations-chat 2022-03-04 00:19:13 there is no use arguing with them ok, leave them
creations-chat 2022-03-04 00:22:04 ik, some arguments are useful while others don't deserve your time
creations-chat 2022-03-04 12:07:38 would recommend the right side walls to have a slight curve around the top, also perhaps add ceiling details?
Other than that, nice
wait is the curve already there?
sapling oh ok
enemy well umm, will change back in a bit but yes my pfp is my pfp ok
creations-chat 2022-03-04 12:12:55 if you plan on adding ceiling details, I would suggest you use a combination of text, trails, winglights, etc.

Nice
