bot-central 2021-07-11 01:45:38 &suggest [TITLE] - Base slot number count on data used not a fixed count.
[CATEGORY] - [BUILDING]

[DESCRIPTION] - Most of the time my builds aren't too too big. So they don't take up to much data. However i only get around 30 saves, which sounds like a lot but goes REALLY fast. So what if we kept the default ~32 (i forget exact number) but allowed to "add" slots as long as the player didn't reach the data cap. Yes I know your rules say no increasing data limit. However this wouldn't increase it, It would simply make better use of the Pre-existing capacity.

creations-chat 2022-03-27 15:48:00 ik its really hard to cram all the stabilizers for things to land while having a runway
creations-chat 2022-03-27 15:51:23 a long platform with planes landing on it that are extremely far from the center of mass is a somewhat hard challenge (especially due to physics ownership conflict). Additionally this carrier can take an absolute beating before it starts going down. They gyros and runway are detachable and retractable in order to restabalize
creations-chat 2022-03-27 15:55:50 I don't anchor it. when weight goes on it those ugly ass fans counter the weight and hold it upright
creations-chat 2022-03-27 16:00:01 i made it colored so i can see what im building i dont care what my stuff looks like but i can just fill it white. I might try it with just the stability components
creations-chat 2022-03-27 16:02:02 If i reposted as an mechanism but a different build would i be flagged as spam (would post a build with just stability comps)
creations-chat 2022-03-28 02:08:08 that looks ass
creations-chat 2022-03-28 02:45:24 some ranks for builds have a part usage req how do i get the parts used number for a build
creations-chat 2022-03-28 22:25:29 if im going to be entirely honest the hull looks extremely bland maybe add some sort of flags/nations/custom ship name/unit number/ other things to color
