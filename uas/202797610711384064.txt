bug-reports 2019-09-18 19:06:40 not sure if this is a bug but motors 2 cant stay on target. if I try to build a tank with motors 2 controlling the cannon it just dances around without me moving my mouse
bug-reports 2019-09-18 19:06:53 I just cant aim with those
bug-reports 2019-09-18 19:08:07 why cant motors just ignore weight
bug-reports 2019-09-18 19:08:34 I expected motors 2 to be usefull
bug-reports 2019-09-18 19:08:43 but I cant build nothing with them
bug-reports 2019-09-18 19:09:23 I will keep my tanks guns on qe,xz until those actually work

help 2019-11-05 20:39:41 I've tried several times but nothing
creations-chat 2019-11-05 20:47:16 Requesting Shipwright II
creations-chat 2019-11-05 20:48:14 Here is the block count. I just want to use suggestions channel pls give me a rank
creations-chat 2019-11-05 20:48:46 Oh there's a surprise for submarines
creations-chat 2019-11-05 20:50:28 Another surprise. tnt cannons
help 2019-11-13 20:10:16 Is there anyway you can explosions work at high speed
help 2019-11-13 20:10:27 tnt takes a while to update its position it seems
help 2019-11-13 20:11:00 I cant use bombs or rockets with "on impact" on because they explode where they were not where they are
help 2019-11-13 20:12:06 I bomb people and they just dont take damage thats so nice
help 2019-11-13 20:12:54 I've tried to make tnt like pudate its position with an archored block set to the same key as the explosion but nothing xD
help 2019-11-13 20:16:56 only 7 block beams
help 2019-11-13 20:17:14 but I thihnk the developers should actually try to fix the tnt thing
help 2019-11-13 20:17:18 it really hurts the game
help 2019-11-13 20:18:11 look the issue is the explosion not being on the same spot as the tnt
help 2019-11-13 20:18:17 you can work around that
help 2019-11-13 20:19:02 ok just imagine
help 2019-11-13 20:19:09 instead of the explosion being on the tnt
help 2019-11-13 20:19:17 it is teleported to the tnt when it explodes
help 2019-11-13 20:19:23 you can make it like freeze into the air
help 2019-11-13 20:20:08 im not saying its that easy
help 2019-11-13 20:20:37 you can make it a asset itself
help 2019-11-13 20:21:50 even if the explosion is inside the tnt you can teleport it to the tnt
help 2019-11-13 20:21:56 I mean I cant be that sure
help 2019-11-13 20:21:59 you can do it on unity
help 2019-11-13 20:22:22 yes but you only need coordinates
help 2019-11-13 20:22:29 and the teleport command I supose
help 2019-11-13 20:23:12 isnt that how funtions work?
help 2019-11-13 20:23:20 if(someone) calls it
help 2019-11-13 20:23:25 something*
help 2019-11-13 20:23:48 ok look at it this way
help 2019-11-13 20:23:52 it detects the colision
help 2019-11-13 20:23:56 thats all you need
help 2019-11-13 20:24:14 after it detects the colision you can make anyway happen after it
help 2019-11-13 20:24:26 you can make a flying orange appear when it colides
help 2019-11-13 20:24:49 yes I know it would kind of increase lag
help 2019-11-13 20:25:03 but explosions are rare
help 2019-11-13 20:26:33 this is the only game explosions have this problem
help 2019-11-13 20:26:36 I can believe that
help 2019-11-13 20:26:41 but it doesnt make sense then
help 2019-11-13 20:28:08 so you're saying other games use like the roblox default explosive system
help 2019-11-13 20:28:11 if I got it right
help 2019-11-13 20:29:03 ok I wont be arguing about the specifics of how you make them work
help 2019-11-13 20:29:04 but look
help 2019-11-13 20:29:09 roblox has tons of games
help 2019-11-13 20:29:12 with explosions
help 2019-11-13 20:29:15 fasts bullter
help 2019-11-13 20:29:21 some very high quality
help 2019-11-13 20:29:31 and plane crazy is the one that cant have the lag
help 2019-11-13 20:29:37 or it just ruins the gameplay
help 2019-11-13 20:29:42 you cant make cutter cannons
help 2019-11-13 20:29:47 you cant make bombs
help 2019-11-13 20:30:13 in the end
help 2019-11-13 20:30:16 what can I build
help 2019-11-13 20:30:22 without being affected by lag
help 2019-11-13 20:30:30 I shoot cutters simple
help 2019-11-13 20:30:36 like a bullet
help 2019-11-13 20:30:51 the new ones dont lag as much
help 2019-11-13 20:30:59 but when it is shot the lag goes away
help 2019-11-13 20:31:44 well I need loose parts
help 2019-11-13 20:31:52 bullets are loose parts
help 2019-11-13 20:31:56 cant work around that
help 2019-11-13 20:32:23 ok I know nothing will work
help 2019-11-13 20:32:25 I had a build
help 2019-11-13 20:32:27 like 50 blocks
help 2019-11-13 20:32:31 it was just a cannon
help 2019-11-13 20:32:36 that had 3 cutter bullets
help 2019-11-13 20:32:43 flying with an anchored block
help 2019-11-13 20:32:44 no motors
help 2019-11-13 20:32:56 I got someone to stand in front of it
help 2019-11-13 20:33:01 only 1 time it dealt damage
help 2019-11-13 20:33:46 cutters were meant for rams too
help 2019-11-13 20:33:59 also cutter spiners work by lagging inside your vehicle
help 2019-11-13 20:34:05 otherside they dont do much
help 2019-11-13 20:34:32 This design cuts my 1500 block tank in hald in 1 seconds
help 2019-11-13 20:34:34 wait
help 2019-11-13 20:34:50 here it is
help 2019-11-13 20:34:58 
help 2019-11-13 20:35:05 the suspensions cause the lag you need
help 2019-11-13 20:35:12 to lag inside my vehicle
help 2019-11-13 20:35:16 and just cut everything
help 2019-11-13 20:36:06 it doesnt do much
help 2019-11-13 20:36:11 unless you spin it really fast
help 2019-11-13 20:36:17 but anyway
help 2019-11-13 20:36:19 the point is
help 2019-11-13 20:36:27 cutters dont need to hit multiple times to cut
help 2019-11-13 20:36:33 they shouldnt*
help 2019-11-13 20:36:39 what happends with cutters spinners
help 2019-11-13 20:36:45 is that you hit so many times
help 2019-11-13 20:36:48 It cuts
help 2019-11-13 20:36:54 but if you just ram into someone
help 2019-11-13 20:36:58 high speed
help 2019-11-13 20:37:00 it doesnt work
help 2019-11-13 20:37:07 even fast cars
help 2019-11-13 20:37:11 im not saying a bullet
help 2019-11-13 20:37:20 even fast cars someone dont do anything with their cutters
help 2019-11-13 20:38:15 but what was I talking about?
help 2019-11-13 20:38:20 oh yes
help 2019-11-13 20:38:25 how lag just ruins the game
help 2019-11-13 20:38:34 cutters and another example
help 2019-11-13 20:38:36 are*
help 2019-11-13 20:39:14 You can destroy this thing (in 1 second) if you lag inside me with cutters
help 2019-11-13 20:39:15 but sometimes they dont do anything
help 2019-11-13 20:39:17 so yeah not cool
help 2019-11-13 20:39:56 well I guess I'll just have to live with it
help 2019-11-13 20:40:04 but its sad cause i really like this game
help 2019-11-13 20:40:17 and lag always ruing my builds
help 2019-11-13 20:40:51 oh I cant make rockets guided with motors 2 because they freeze into the air when they are not connected to the main pilot seat
help 2019-11-13 20:40:53 thats another one
bug-reports 2019-11-29 20:30:48 So some reason motos and disconnectors only work when the anchored block is off
bug-reports 2019-11-29 20:31:17 its a 1500 block build I dont know if it has anything to do with that
bug-reports 2019-11-29 20:31:22 but it worked before this update
bug-reports 2019-11-29 20:34:00 btw on my server there is a guy with a battleship that gets lauched into the sky when he spawns(he uses motors 2)
help 2019-12-16 20:53:59 Cmon we need 0,9*0.9 blocks
help 2019-12-16 20:54:12 I have to use wedges
help 2019-12-16 20:54:18 it just ruins the build
help 2019-12-20 14:04:11 conveyors 1*2 only have a 1block hitbox on build mode? or is it just me
help 2019-12-20 14:04:17 I just got a wedge inside one
help 2020-02-26 14:20:55 is bug abuse reportable?
help 2020-02-26 14:21:48 if someone builds a car that lags a lot so they can go inside me with cutters, because lag stops the collision
help 2020-02-26 14:22:03 is that reportable?
help 2020-02-26 14:39:20 that depends
help 2020-02-26 14:39:44 there is the weight and the distance to the rotor factors
help 2020-02-26 14:40:02 just test it until it works
help 2020-03-01 14:20:13 Do screenshots for ranks need to be taken with Gyazo?
help 2020-03-01 14:23:55 ok

help 2020-03-01 15:15:19 <@!314383347214319616> Requesting terrain specialist [II]
help 2020-03-01 15:15:25 
creations-chat 2020-03-01 15:28:38 Not the best looking tank, but has a lot to it. The cannon has rockets and guns but is also a tnt cannon ( shoots 8 tnt balls), the black and blue thing is used to aim(can be ajusted for distance). On top of the turrer there are also 2 "MGs" (1 gun 2 fireworks each) controled by motors 2. The grey camera is used to look up and enables me to shoot up. The turrer uses 1 layer of tnt armor(for some reason tnt can only be destroyed by tnt). The entire build uses only 1006 block which is nice since I built it for pvp.
creations-chat 2020-03-01 15:31:45 for some reason I wrote turrer instead of turret, also the camera is used to look around not just up.
help 2020-03-01 15:37:12 ty
