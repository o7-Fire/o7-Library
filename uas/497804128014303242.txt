plane-crazy 2020-07-16 16:13:08 An overlenghened pillow
plane-crazy 2020-07-16 16:09:17 That's it?
plane-crazy 2020-07-16 16:08:26 Is there anything i can improve about this tank?
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 17:53:06 The return of the king
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 17:52:09 Why?
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 17:40:06 Yah
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 17:27:41 What do you think of that
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 17:19:01 Unpainted parts are new additions
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 17:18:44 This is after an upgrade
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 17:18:31 This is pre- upgrade
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 16:37:39 This is the original
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 16:37:28 I upgraded the red squatter, main changes:
1: added a turret a gun at the back of cockpit
2: back upper wing is now smaller and closer to the back
3: vack wings reshaped to shape closer than front wings
4: made front wings a little chonkier so the plane would be less alergic to higher speeds and for COM and COF would be closer toghever
Changed places are uncolored
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 16:50:49 Oh
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 16:49:58 Bruh momentum
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 16:43:46 It's still works fine, but could get stuck on a few angles
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 16:39:56 It's only glitchy if you don't use propulsion engines to turn or switch immiedeatly from forward to backward
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 16:37:02 I think
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 16:36:59 Bruh this tank gets to like 87 speed
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 16:35:45 <@658486194937659412> the conveyors act as tank treads
plane-crazy 2020-06-26 15:04:58 But it is very unstable
plane-crazy 2020-06-26 15:04:46 I built a heli
plane-crazy 2020-06-26 11:33:27 Did you try to join a non pvp and join back pvp, cuz if you will join pvp while in pvp it wont work
plane-crazy 2020-06-26 09:36:35 Damn, my firebringer (mig 15 ripoff) is pretty durable in terms of wings
plane-crazy 2020-06-25 07:56:44 I have MP5
plane-crazy 2020-06-25 07:56:38 Bruh mp3?
plane-crazy 2020-06-24 18:37:47 
plane-crazy 2020-06-24 18:37:28 And there's wayyy too much detail inside
plane-crazy 2020-06-24 18:36:51 And this is my new tank
plane-crazy 2020-06-24 18:26:36 Look, my first tank
plane-crazy 2020-06-24 18:26:29 Hey guys
plane-crazy 2020-06-15 12:57:13 Ok that's an improvement for the wings
plane-crazy 2020-06-14 19:04:31 So any improvements to make my plane look more like Mig-15/F-86D?
plane-crazy 2020-06-14 19:02:29 
plane-crazy 2020-06-14 19:01:55 It is mainly based around  F-86D and mig-15, the first gen jets
plane-crazy 2020-06-14 18:57:19 Peenut
plane-crazy 2020-06-14 18:56:21 Do it
plane-crazy 2020-06-14 18:55:42 Thats it?
plane-crazy 2020-06-14 18:50:15 What do you think of this fighter jet, it is based around jets of korean war era, do you think i could paint in or it could use some improvements?
plane-crazy 2020-06-12 15:17:13 Helium
