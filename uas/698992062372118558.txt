creations-chat 2021-09-27 13:40:46 <@880395190366511105> Engines and nose looking weird, a bit blocky and kinda bad paint
creations-chat 2021-10-15 15:01:15 No way !
creations-chat 2021-10-15 15:06:44 even in 15 days of playtime it's waaay enough to be good
creations-chat 2021-10-15 15:08:50 becoming good in pvp is kinda easy, but now you're good in pvp be good in LOOKS
creations-chat 2021-10-15 15:11:05 You get more satisfaction playing something good-looking and being good at pvp than being good at pvp with a weird-looking build
creations-chat 2021-10-15 15:13:17 It's like saying "I know 1+1= 2 so I shouldn't continue school"
creations-chat 2021-10-15 15:15:19 Then you shouldn't be here in the first place, it's the whole point of the game
creations-chat 2021-10-15 15:17:27 S a t i s f a c t i o n, if you don't want to progress, you'll never progress and so, if you don't progress you just don't want to try to progress aaaand.... you know what I mean

creations-chat 2021-10-18 14:49:54 <@889686867560259584> isn't that a tutorial ?
creations-chat 2021-12-05 15:24:27 <@!688806157749715044> Try adding detail and make it less blocky, the turrets should be flatter
creations-chat 2021-12-05 19:30:45 Why the hell is the first pic of my Mosasaur having 20 upvotes less than the last one
creations-chat 2021-12-05 19:32:50 Y o u r  o p i n i o n.e x e
creations-chat 2021-12-05 19:35:12 If he post it in creations then get billions of dislikes (downvotes) then he should probably assume he's...

creations-chat 2021-12-05 19:38:19 He hasn't got a slightest bit of skill, he's trash and can't even face the reality ?
creations-chat 2021-12-05 19:41:29 And for him modern warships and WW2 battleships are the same thing
events-chat 2022-02-09 11:15:32 Replace the doof's propellors with water props 1x3 and you'll get a fighter submarine
events-chat 2022-02-09 11:16:51 Yeah too, but like it's better with water prop

creations-chat 2022-02-13 09:22:35 yeah, his attack aircraft is custom so I think... Wait, it's custom right?
creations-chat 2022-02-13 09:28:04 Like the hell, everything is worng with his A-10, wings, bombs are touching the ground, landing gear is hella small, the cockpit is way too small, and the hell is this mutant fuselage
creations-chat 2022-02-13 09:30:21 I also forgot to mention the Avenger canon's ridiculous size
creations-chat 2022-02-13 09:34:31 Yes 'cause A-10 is a ground attack aircraft so yes <:PewPew:532303441293344778>
creations-chat 2022-02-13 09:36:41 I'm a white name noob and I can still make a flying plane with better proportions than your <:FineTroll:626841259746656289>

contest-chat 2022-03-02 16:45:46 Does artillery count as an Infantry fighting vehicle?
contest-chat 2022-03-02 16:46:14 Basically tanks, AA, armoured cars, troop transport

contest-chat 2022-03-02 16:47:02 ok so ig artillery doesn't really count
contest-chat 2022-03-02 16:47:53 so does artillery count as IFV?
contest-chat 2022-03-02 16:48:50 k
contest-chat 2022-03-02 17:22:23 Dumb question asked by a dumb person: are custom IFVs allowed?

creations-chat 2022-03-04 17:42:02 nO iT CaN CaRrY HiS cReW
creations-chat 2022-03-04 17:44:18 Damn tough, did you read it "IFV is any vehicle that can carry troops (technically BMPT can) under the protection of A R M O R and has a gun, basically AFV's definition with troops carrying ability
creations-chat 2022-03-04 17:47:20 Does carrying 5 crew members still count? Or did I just do it for it to be massively downvoted in <#384025409945337856> ?
creations-chat 2022-03-04 17:49:24 Guess it's option 2 <:hahaa:773727260539617280>
creations-chat 2022-03-04 17:52:16 But now can I have actual constructive critisim? ( crap the bad angle pic)

creations-chat 2022-04-08 22:35:20 Ok, if you want. Let's continue, here, I violently provocated you by replying.
creations-chat 2022-04-08 22:37:19 I don't care if it doesn't have motorlock, there's an enormous lack of detail, that's all. And it can be fixed without motorlock
creations-chat 2022-04-08 22:39:02 Do you have brain damage ? I just told you I did not care if there wasn't any motorlock in your build, there's just a lack of detail
