creations-chat 2021-07-08 17:17:39 yes they shall
creations-chat 2021-07-08 17:19:55 f i forgot to put in that its a adition of canyon too with the pink and green
the one with only orange peach grey and yellow was looking kinda dead
also if you dont know the wings arent just rectangles . im trying to make the model as detailed as possible as well as making it look more like my design
creations-chat 2021-07-08 17:22:11 and megago they are motor locked wing panels
i just added half blocks ontop of them so they dont look too blocky
creations-chat 2021-07-08 17:24:13 should i just grey if the colour scheme is that bad
*cries in the inside*
its the improvised landing gear
hmm ok
creations-chat 2021-07-08 17:27:20 what's the colour code for desert camo  ? <@!715148402022678608>
creations-chat 2021-07-08 17:29:42 cant find any desert camo and people hate its current paint job so ill make it grey
bot-central 2021-07-10 18:29:44 !servers
creations-chat 2021-07-28 08:50:14 Professionals , pls give me any better paint job ideas , this prototype paintjob is trash
creations-chat 2021-07-28 09:26:41 thx for the sheeeeesh oof i forgot to post the pick for it
it looks much better
creations-chat 2021-07-28 09:30:50 
creations-chat 2021-08-23 14:42:44 I made a custom jet inspired by the F-15E strike eagle , I'm finished with the paintjob but i need confirmation if its good or not , and if I should remove the black design on the back of the cockpit that makes it a bit tacky
creations-chat 2021-08-23 14:46:08 another pic
creations-chat 2021-08-23 14:50:03 does this look better
creations-chat 2021-08-23 14:53:18 its not that tall , and yeah i think the nose is already too big and fat so i might not be able to change that in this amount of time . i guess i'll submit it like this and get a low amount of upvotes
creations-chat 2021-08-23 15:04:04 i knew it was too common yeah . it wasn't meant to be another f15 project i used it as a beginner for my first compact-disconnector build , and i wanted to go of simple
creations-chat 2021-08-23 15:07:16 dam i guess i'm that bad at building

bug-reports 2022-08-21 14:47:43 is it just me or does anyone else have that stupid glich that stops your rockets or fireworks from shooting any projectiles at all unless you arent moving or having to spam it so many times
creations-chat 2022-08-27 17:24:16 im trying to make a futuristic transport craft but as im moving on to make the wings i realise there are so many dam choices for it i cannot decide which one i should use that wont cost me 2 months to make . when my  cooldown comes off i will post the images
creations-chat 2022-08-27 17:28:54 the design is futuristic + i will give it a super converyer engine so it can have smth like hyperspace 
 
 the pictures of the actual space craft are first , then the wing ideas are the other google images
creations-chat 2022-08-27 17:31:38 cockpit is just a place holder for now it'll get better when im finalizing the build trus me.
ill just afk and watch Godzilla singular point until a collective amount of people choose
