plane-crazy 2020-05-27 08:56:23 Not finished yet, planning to make this hover, i still need to make 6 more tentacles and then after that if the tentacles aren't balanced i have to figure out how to balance them which may make me have to restart on the tentacles.
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 20:39:10 pretty sure how fast it can go up or down

plane-crazy 2020-04-18 22:49:54 
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 08:24:03 more precise movements
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 08:23:53 just found out if you only use 1x1 control surfaces you can have better control over your plane
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 08:12:46 <@!177743269105500160> Control panels going up and down right
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 08:11:15 whats the easiest way to make a plane turn faster

plane-crazy 2020-04-17 09:03:19 bet if there was a poll people would vote yes for it to be a thing
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 09:03:05 but i still dont know how being able to drive other people's creations wouldnt be fun
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 09:02:36 well i do to some extent
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 09:02:27 but i dont understand coding struggles
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 09:02:19 doesnt mean i dont know struggles
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 09:01:14 i already said i cant code worth crap
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 09:00:42 but i know its not that hard, i know people that have learned most of it in like 3 months
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 09:00:19 i cant code worth shid but i can build
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 08:59:12 yes and roblox is highly adaptable, and its free
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 08:58:08 so they removed it i guess
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 08:57:56 cant u see others keybinds when they're out of they're plot
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 08:57:33 u can check the keybinds
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 08:57:30 thats why theres a screwdriver
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 08:56:53 how would it not
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 08:56:24 it would be fun
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 08:56:20 like you could have pvp matches against each other but in the other persons creation
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 08:55:50 and how is it a useless function, it would make the game so much more enjoyable getting to show your creation off on a different level
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 08:55:16 and u can blacklist them from your plot
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 08:55:08 thats why you can block them on roblox so u dont have to see they're chat
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 08:54:46 do you understand what a whitelist is
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 08:54:14 simple
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 08:54:11 add a driving whitelist
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 08:54:04 thats why there are things called settings
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 08:53:36 are we ever going to be able to have the option to drive somebody else's creation
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 08:21:52 dude thats top secret footage of the government's anti air system

plane-crazy 2020-04-14 05:37:15 we need a (pickle rickje139) emote added to the server
plane-crazy 2020-04-14 05:36:42 wait
plane-crazy 2020-04-14 05:36:12 it makes the map look weird, even that 1st island to the right of the plots is cutoff suddenly
plane-crazy 2020-04-14 05:35:26 y tho
plane-crazy 2020-04-14 05:33:08 shouldnt there be more ocean behind the plots so you dont just plummet into the void

plane-crazy 2020-04-14 04:56:30 r u making more secrets in the map like that little sea cave?
plane-crazy 2020-04-14 04:54:30 they should add an apartment complex on the map with a working elevator
plane-crazy 2020-04-14 04:54:01 for M A S S I V E things
plane-crazy 2020-04-14 04:53:54 we require even bigger
plane-crazy 2020-04-14 04:49:32 that looks more like a R O P E than a crane or fishing rod
plane-crazy 2020-04-14 04:38:26 they took it away nvm
plane-crazy 2020-04-14 04:17:49 that is the large amount of S t u f f
