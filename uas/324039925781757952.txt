creations-chat 2020-03-07 00:59:32 why do people hate on my creation? its an original creation, may not look too pretty but that's because its not flying in the picture, plus if i was flying it, it still wouldn't look as good then it does in game. (I know people have rights for their opinion but still)
creations-chat 2020-03-07 01:01:34 so basically you get mad at people using a function that's allowed?
creations-chat 2020-03-07 01:02:46 if it was then it would be in the rules
