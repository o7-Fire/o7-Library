creations-chat 2021-02-28 01:17:20 why is everyone downvoting in creations
creations-chat 2021-02-28 01:22:33 I can't make a good train because the devs don't give us proper parts for trains, I can't get ranks because I can't make a good train, and i can't suggest to add more train parts because I don't have ranks
creations-chat 2021-02-28 01:25:05 when i saw the you tried I heard the sound
creations-chat 2021-02-28 01:33:11 looks like a digital rendering
creations-chat 2021-03-01 20:30:41 so how crappy is my choo-choo
creations-chat 2021-03-01 20:36:50 well the train I made is ussaully all black- hey wait a miniute, YoUr'E rAcIsT fOr NoT lIkInG iT bEiNg BlAcK!!!!11111!!!11!!
creations-chat 2021-03-02 01:38:51 well back in the day I played phantom forces a lot (still do now and then), my go-to weapon was the KSG, which started production in 2011. I know it's weird but it's better than this shitty roblox username i made when i was 11
the-dump 2021-03-02 03:48:18 anyone want some garbage
the-dump 2021-03-02 03:48:42 kk

creations-chat 2021-03-04 02:54:35 hey guys whats the best material for a stainless steel look, metal, foil or diamond plate?
creations-chat 2021-03-04 02:59:05 alright thanks
creations-chat 2021-03-04 03:06:32 *cloudy with a chance of meatballs flashbacks intensify*
creations-chat 2021-03-04 03:14:34 well everyone, here's a fun life tip: do not under any circumstances attempt to make a locomotive with a rounded nose in this game
creations-chat 2021-03-04 03:24:42 and here I though only trains had tenders, but I suppose it makes sense for boats
creations-chat 2021-03-04 03:26:45 this is what happens when you try to make a vehicle with a rounded nose
creations-chat 2021-03-04 03:28:46 yeah yeah im too poor for robux sue me
creations-chat 2021-03-05 21:32:20 is there any way to make my locomotive's nose more rounded?
creations-chat 2021-03-05 21:34:23 so no?
creations-chat 2021-03-06 03:05:10 close enough an EMD FT
creations-chat 2021-03-06 03:45:21 "use more materials add more detail" they said I did that and still get downvoted to hell
creations-chat 2021-03-06 03:48:59 what
creations-chat 2021-03-06 04:01:37 well rounded noses arent exactly easy to build in a game of squares and wedges
the-dump 2021-03-06 04:03:37 I think I'm the only guy on the server who understands this
creations-chat 2021-03-09 01:28:25 it's certainly better than my EMD FT, the nose is much more rounded, bu the plane crazy community just seems to hate trains, and given how neglected they are in-game, I suppose the devs do too
creations-chat 2021-03-09 01:40:57 ah good your online canned
creations-chat 2021-03-09 01:43:25 so uh is that the only locomotive you've built?
creations-chat 2021-03-09 01:51:29 yeah I built this along with my FT it was an early project though and could use improvement
creations-chat 2021-03-10 04:32:43 anyone know why 99% of the community hates train builds?
creations-chat 2021-03-10 04:36:32 I know there's barely an track, there's only one type of wheel which is poorly designed, the curves are too sharp, the loop at the airport is so uneven derailment is near guaranteed, there are no domes to go with cylinders or 1/4 and 1/2 cylinders, but even so I've seen some good ones get downvoted more than they should have
creations-chat 2021-03-10 04:38:57 wdym
creations-chat 2021-03-10 04:48:57 I mean recently I saw a very nice F7 which was downvoted
creations-chat 2021-03-10 04:53:34 that doesn't detract frim the rest of it
creations-chat 2021-03-16 20:36:35 so how badly would you guys downvote my GE genisis
creations-chat 2021-03-16 20:40:28 I don't think it's bad I think it's ok, people just love to downvote train builds
creations-chat 2021-03-16 20:43:21 what textures would you suggest I used metal for most except glass for windows, foil for lights and diamond plate for exhaust vents
creations-chat 2021-03-16 20:46:24 well both of those are fucking phenomenal but they have to fold them weird to get them to spawn
creations-chat 2021-03-16 20:48:48 who built that
creations-chat 2021-03-16 20:51:23 well I'm just gonna post it anyways later tonight, might as well, I know it's not completely accurate but I don't see how I can improve the texture and paint
creations-chat 2021-03-17 00:46:23 not put an emoji on it and give it wheels in the front and back so it can get over slopes
creations-chat 2021-03-25 20:37:04 if anyone needs a chassis for a centipede tender here you go
creations-chat 2021-03-25 20:39:26 well as a redditor I will gladly join you in bullying people for using emjois😆 😆 😆
creations-chat 2021-03-25 20:41:28 Is that breaking rule 3 I smell? (yes it is)
creations-chat 2021-03-25 20:44:10 seems too smooth, but otherwise good
creations-chat 2021-03-26 01:49:00 Time to waste hours of my life making one of these; getting it to fold so it fits on the plot and unfold properly onto the track is gonna be fun
creations-chat 2021-03-26 01:55:32 it's a bit bland (both, also the turret shape)
creations-chat 2021-03-26 02:17:37 no

the-dump 2021-03-27 00:50:26 yeah, support an organization that started riots that caused over 20 deaths and billions of dollars in damage in the last year, (and no, I'm not racist, I hate the organization, not black people, if you think I'm racist for it, than YOU'RE racist for thinking that BLM represents all black Americans, and yes, what Oakland is doing is clearly racism towards whites)
creations-chat 2021-03-27 00:51:26 ok

help 2021-03-28 03:21:32 I attached train cars together with ropes at first, but when flinging and vibrating, became worse because of the ropes, after working on another vehicle and thinking a bit, I made a motor coupler instead which is much better
help 2021-03-28 03:21:48 so just work on something else a bit, think it over, and come back

creations-chat 2021-04-01 16:51:15 yeah i needed to do that so the boiler would straighten out after turns, so it's a hybrid between a mallet and a garret
creations-chat 2021-04-01 16:56:17 thanks, i usually make my steam locomotives with the driving wheels aesthetic and the leading and trailing wheels powered with the in-game train wheels; I'd have to redesign the chassis to make the driving wheels work and I've moved back the rear half of the wheels far too many times to get it to work at all
creations-chat 2021-04-02 01:58:07 a little angley but otherwise good, is that the C&O steam turbine locomotive?
creations-chat 2021-04-02 02:01:14 im actually making a big boy rn, but due to game mechanics it's more of a 4-8-4-8-4, hybrid between a mallet and garret

help 2021-04-23 02:46:25 is there a good way to stop the motors used in folding builds from splitting again?
help 2021-04-23 02:49:30 how does that work

creations-chat 2021-05-03 02:36:34 most locomotives were all black, i did a more dark gray with a hint of blue so the coal in the tender can be distinguished better

creations-chat 2021-05-06 19:20:48 Ideally the gap between the cab and tender would be three blocks, but due to the ridiculously sharp curves I had to make it eleven; it may be able to work with ten but I’m not going to rebuild it all for that

the-dump 2021-05-15 02:36:52

the-dump 2021-05-16 02:09:02 shut. the. hot. crispy. kentucky. fried. mother. fucking. hell. up.
the-dump 2021-05-16 02:09:15 anything specific?
the-dump 2021-05-16 02:10:11 dieselization of US railroads sound good?
the-dump 2021-05-16 02:12:05 so you know how all the trains you see around are diesel-powered but a long time ago there were a bunch of steam powered ones instead?
the-dump 2021-05-16 02:13:27 so most of them
the-dump 2021-05-16 02:13:29 anyway
the-dump 2021-05-16 02:13:54 people didn't like how maintenance-intensive they were and all the fumes and ash they made
the-dump 2021-05-16 02:14:29 electric trains needed wires and catenaries to hold them which were very expensive though, so those didn't really catch on except in a few areas
the-dump 2021-05-16 02:14:54 then someone took the shit leftover from turning crude oil to gas
the-dump 2021-05-16 02:15:00 they had gas on steroids
the-dump 2021-05-16 02:15:06 called it "diesel"
the-dump 2021-05-16 02:15:31 eventually in 1912 in Switzerland someone put in a choo-choo
the-dump 2021-05-16 02:15:58 in 1920s we got some small diesels for organizing train cars
the-dump 2021-05-16 02:16:17 then in the mid 1930s we got ones that could pull fast passenger trains
the-dump 2021-05-16 02:16:29 then in the late 1930s we got ones that could pull freight trains
the-dump 2021-05-16 02:17:27 WWII delayed dieselization tho, as diesels required oil and not coal (though some steam locomotives did use coal instead of oil, most were coal) and the army need oil more than coal, and diesels needed more precious materials than steam
the-dump 2021-05-16 02:19:48 most major railroads stopped ordering steam locomotives en masse, if no outright, in 1944, and would have likely stopped even earlier in they had known Japan would surrender in 1945 and not 1946 at the earliest because of the Soviets attacking them and the atomic bombs
the-dump 2021-05-16 02:19:58 someone asked me about choo-choos for some reason
the-dump 2021-05-16 02:20:23 anyway
the-dump 2021-05-16 02:21:01 most steam locomotives built en-masse after WWII were for railroads that transported a lot of coal, with some exceptions
the-dump 2021-05-16 02:21:26 first major railroad dieselized in 1949
the-dump 2021-05-16 02:22:58 you want more?
the-dump 2021-05-16 02:23:03 I wasn't done
the-dump 2021-05-16 02:25:08 1963 was the last time a major railroad used a steam locomotive in regular service
the-dump 2021-05-16 02:25:32 except for a narrow gauge railroad which operated them into 1968
the-dump 2021-05-16 02:26:16 some industrial and short-line railroads used steam into the early 80s
the-dump 2021-05-16 02:26:50 while most steam locomotives were scrapped, with entire classes going extinct, some were preserved, with a few still running
the-dump 2021-05-16 02:28:14 there are even some being built new now as replicas, most noptably PRR duplex 4-4-4-4 #5550, which hopefully will take the British locomotive Mallard's record as fastest steam locomotive at 126 MPH, as there were some claims that the T1s exceeded 140 MPH in service (though THAT fast is unlikely)
the-dump 2021-05-16 02:28:29 that's it I guess, can I ask why you asked mike?
the-dump 2021-05-16 02:30:57 sure
the-dump 2021-05-16 02:31:47 to be more specific, I was referring to the Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad
the-dump 2021-05-16 02:31:59 it ran both standard gauge and narrow gauge
the-dump 2021-05-16 02:32:09 it started as narrow gauge
the-dump 2021-05-16 02:32:13 expanded
the-dump 2021-05-16 02:32:15 went bankrupt
the-dump 2021-05-16 02:32:18 recovered
the-dump 2021-05-16 02:32:23 expanded some more
the-dump 2021-05-16 02:33:01 after WWII it started abandoning narrow gauge lines due to lack of use
the-dump 2021-05-16 02:33:47 because this they never bothered dieselizing them, while it was quick to dieselize standard gauge operations despite having a lot of coal to compete with the Union Pacific's route to the North that was faster
the-dump 2021-05-16 02:34:35 last run of the narrow gauge there was 1968, but three small sections have been preserved as tourists railroads with restored narrow gauge locomotives
the-dump 2021-05-16 02:35:02 what do you mean recovered?
the-dump 2021-05-16 02:35:23 well I guess it's cheaper than standard gauge

creations-chat 2021-07-02 01:33:08 I don't think you even need motor lock to make a good T1, wedges should be good enough, the main problem is that 5x5 wheels aren't big enough for the driving wheels. Just make yours like 2-3 times taller, add a tender and it would be much better

creations-chat 2021-09-13 03:24:07 Ok I have the base of what’s going to be a ghost train for October. It’s obviously not painted yet and not all the detailing is there, but this is how it folds out- the main problem I’ve found is that the trailing truck can be iffy if I hit the sharp curves at full speed, and it can be difficult to unfold, but otherwise I think the base is done. I was originally going to have 4 coaches but seeing how hard it is to unfold 2 I won’t add more. I had to record this on my phone so the video is gonna be kinda crappy
creations-chat 2021-09-13 03:29:28 No, it’s just attached in an articulated manner with motors, I’ll get a screenshot
creations-chat 2021-09-13 03:34:38 The corners of the bogie (on the far right) hit the bottom of the firebox when the locomotive goes around sharp curves, but it’s only an issue when going fast. The read end of the trailing truck also brushes the front tender bogie on sharp curves, but once again, only an issue at high speeds. I suppose these issues could be fixed by having a single axle trailing truck rather than a double axle one, but I prefer 2-10-4s to 2-10-2s and it’s not the worst problem
creations-chat 2021-09-13 03:42:06 It uses 2, I’ll try using one, thanks… also should I put the one set of gliders near the front or rear of the trailing truck?
creations-chat 2021-09-13 03:51:02 Well that made things worse

bug-reports 2021-09-23 02:00:13 If you use the "Rails" spawn one of the four spawns is closest to the station; however, if your build is too wide part of it will get stuck inside the station when spawning; to fix this the spawn either must be moved forward or the station shortened from the end closer to the map edge.
help 2021-09-23 02:07:58 add more control surfaces and/or have motors turn wing panels

bug-reports 2021-09-23 20:59:51 What do you mean it will be fine you glitch inside the building and can’t move they have to fix it

bug-reports 2021-09-23 23:28:49 No I’m annoying you because you won’t accept the fact it’s a bug
bug-reports 2021-09-23 23:29:06 I’m not gonna spam rickje like a dumbass
bug-reports 2021-09-23 23:29:41 And I told you someone can just move the wall back in studio and it’s fixed
bug-reports 2021-09-23 23:30:39 NOT THE WALL PARALLEL TO THE TRACKS THE WALL PERPENDICULAR TO THE TRACKS I ALREADY TOLD YOU THAT
bug-reports 2021-09-23 23:31:08 THE GAP IS STILL THE SAME ITS JUST THE PLATFORM LEGNTH
bug-reports 2021-09-23 23:31:44 YES IT MEANS YOUR BUILD WONT GET STUCK
bug-reports 2021-09-23 23:32:07 Ok dumbass thanks for being so graceful in your defeat
bug-reports 2021-09-23 23:32:57 BECAUSE YOUR BUILD IS GLITCHED INSIDE IT UPON SPAWNING
bug-reports 2021-09-23 23:33:57 DO YOU WANNA KNOW HOW MANY TIMES IVE WANTED TO SPAWN IN A CERTAIN PLACE AND GOTTEN IN THE SAME PLACE SEVERAL TIMES
bug-reports 2021-09-23 23:34:24 THAT DIESNT CHANGE THAT ITS AN ISSUE
bug-reports 2021-09-23 23:35:20 SO IF PLANES BIG ENOUGH THAT USED THE AIRPORT SPAWN HAD A CHANCE TO GET STUCK HALF INSIDE FHE AIRPORT BUILDING THAT WOUKDNT BE AN ISSUE?
bug-reports 2021-09-23 23:35:30 fucking shit yourself
bug-reports 2021-09-23 23:50:56 SO TRAINS THAT FOLD SHOULD FIT ON THE TRACKS TOO
bug-reports 2021-09-24 00:06:29 you shouldn't have to worry about being lucky and spawning in the right place, fixing the bug would be this easy it has nothing to do with the hardcoding
bug-reports 2021-09-24 00:07:44 moving the spawn might affect the hardcoding but not the station wall
bug-reports 2021-09-24 00:23:55 It’s still a bug it has nothing to do with rejoining
bug-reports 2021-09-24 00:24:19 I know but the solution to that bug is pretty easy
bug-reports 2021-09-24 00:24:32 As shown in my expert-level drawing
bug-reports 2021-09-24 00:26:09 It’s a folding build

creations-chat 2021-09-26 17:19:33 ok I tried a rusty look for my ghost train instead of a semi-transparent one (for some fucking reason you can't put multiple images in a message on browser and this channel for some fucking reason has a 2 minute cooldown)

creations-chat 2021-09-26 17:38:13 It being a ghost train, sometimes ghosts are a translucent blue and it’s supposed to be viewed at night so without lights it would look too dark. Red would make it look demonic which isn’t what I’m going for
creations-chat 2021-09-26 17:40:15 No one builds trains so make one of those
creations-chat 2021-09-26 17:42:46 In the first message I said it’s a ghost train when I tried semi-transparent nobody liked it

bug-reports 2021-09-26 20:37:48 TBF this channel isn’t to active so he didn’t have to to far to see me arguing with someone who thinks a spawning bug isn’t an issue

creations-chat 2021-10-27 00:52:32 One of the reasons mine is crappy though is I think it looks weird more than 2 blocks off the wheel and yours is 3 which is one of the reasons it’s so detailed
creations-chat 2021-10-27 00:54:36 I mean if it works it works
creations-chat 2021-10-27 00:56:43 Wait how is that possible you would need a 15 block wide body to fully cover a 3 block balance gear I use 13 wide bodies and it only just covers the valve gear

creations-chat 2022-02-27 21:28:27 Suspension is a bit rigid and the parts sticking out the back of the turret are just to make it look needlessly edgy but otherwise it’s nice
creations-chat 2022-02-27 21:35:19 Yeah that’s good just probably give it a more traditional woodlands or desert camp since people don’t like it and you should be good
creations-chat 2022-03-06 04:06:07 is this motion and valve gear ok (red is connecting rods, blue piston rod and yellow valve gear)

creations-chat 2022-03-10 01:06:59 <@!814859640126832660> nice A1 but I think the boiler is a tad too wide and lowered down

creations-chat 2022-03-18 20:36:54 <@!748539835484078130> where are the blades
creations-chat 2022-03-19 13:44:03 <@!757379467227168888> nice how do you get the front to look so nice? I can’t tel if it’s motorlock or not
creations-chat 2022-03-20 00:53:01 also the valve gear is nice but are you sure there wasn’t a way to do it without not having the siderods on the front driving wheels?
creations-chat 2022-03-20 00:59:51 Like in the picture it looks like the siderods don’t connect to the first two driving wheels
creations-chat 2022-03-20 01:05:03 Yeah
creations-chat 2022-03-20 01:12:10 Oh I guess it was just the angle
creations-chat 2022-03-21 01:19:38 <@!774819108784832512> pathetic Loomian Legacy players have been waiting almost 20 months
creations-chat 2022-03-21 02:23:12 you said pc players only have been waiting 6 months
creations-chat 2022-03-30 21:40:42 <@!869466331584544789> nice big boy but you probably should’ve done a 9x9 boiler and there are a lot of gaps you can see through that didn’t exist on the real thing; under the boiler, firebox and between the tender and its front bogie
creations-chat 2022-04-06 14:28:15 <@410992368494575626> holy crap that's amazing can we get a build mode picture?
creations-chat 2022-04-06 14:31:26 that's not what I'm doing I have zero clue how motorlock works look at the builds I've made they're all trash
creations-chat 2022-04-06 14:41:18 wow, thanks, I'll try that from now on
creations-chat 2022-04-06 14:44:43 also one thing I should mention, I do sometimes use colorpickers on images of the trains I'm making to get more accurate colors, but often yes, I do just use the default colors
contest-chat 2022-04-07 00:36:17 We were so damn close to getting trains as the competition but nooooooo you wanted your stupid spaceships didn’t you
contest-chat 2022-04-07 00:37:54 If it’s just because rickje doesn’t know how to make train curves you can just show it without going on the curves or make a ground train…
contest-chat 2022-04-07 01:54:17 what the fuck did you just say you blasphemic uncultured swine
contest-chat 2022-04-07 01:56:58 and they can pull a hell of a lot more weight plus look and sound cooler
contest-chat 2022-04-07 01:58:00 sounds like a vacuum
contest-chat 2022-04-07 01:59:04 
contest-chat 2022-04-07 02:00:05 snack time
contest-chat 2022-04-07 02:01:17 this can pull a hella lot more weight and looks and sounds cooler than any plane I've seen
contest-chat 2022-04-07 02:05:53 ok but like https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEN_wUwzIIE
contest-chat 2022-04-07 02:08:30 a massive hunk of fire-breathing, black wrought steel belching soot, steam and ash hauling thousands of tons over a hill is a lot better than eh
contest-chat 2022-04-07 02:16:23 thats boring; its slow and just slides around on top of the water
contest-chat 2022-04-07 02:17:30 yeah they do that crap and ruin the econemy
creations-chat 2022-04-09 00:22:03 <@!915471910991720499> you don’t need springs on a train chassis there aren’t any bumps to absorb…
creations-chat 2022-04-09 00:55:26 Yeah because IRL the tracks bend under the weight of the train a little and there’s also horizontal for a train’s side to side motion, something not needed in PC
creations-chat 2022-04-09 01:39:04 <@915471910991720499> if you want a train chassis just do this:
creations-chat 2022-04-09 01:46:17 it doesn't even need to there arent any in plane crazy tracks, the one good thing about them
creations-chat 2022-04-09 01:54:58 yeah springs don't help there the only thing you can do is have a short or long enough chassis
creations-chat 2022-04-09 02:19:56 only my old and bad trains and one with short cars can do it, springs wouldn't make a difference, rickje just needs to copy paste the loop by the conveyors up there

the-dump 2022-04-26 03:05:27 Yeah
the-dump 2022-04-26 03:05:35 Nice pfp by the way
the-dump 2022-04-26 03:06:08 Pretty much; Art Deco was fun
the-dump 2022-04-26 03:06:52 I wonder what would happen if there was an attempt to reintroduce Art Deco style trains
creations-chat 2022-04-29 18:20:11 <@766369468347580437> nice but train suspension is useless in plane crazy since unlike in real life the rails and track bed don’t shift under the weight of the train
creations-chat 2022-05-07 17:04:26 it's a mix of two dark grays, in real life that's how they look
the-dump 2022-05-10 20:35:42 
creations-chat 2022-05-11 11:41:14 Yes why do you think the trucks are so spaced out
creations-chat 2022-05-11 11:49:24 I’ve seen longer ones (that’s what she said), as they were built at a smaller scale, but it and two others of the same length are the longest for the scale I make and are the longest that can fit in the loop at the bottom
creations-chat 2022-05-22 00:37:48 <@766607070899208192> no your train is not pretty decent it’s way too undersized for the track and has little detail and texture variation
creations-chat 2022-05-22 13:55:48 <@914779689745285140> your T1 is decent but I recommend giving it more accurately sized 7x7 wheels when PC2 comes out, as well as making the siderods cleaner and adding details like red lining, handrails and ladders. Also, I noticed you said you had trouble getting a working coupler, so I recommend using this design I made (the ropes I have below it just simulate a brake pipe, it isn’t necessary): https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/827603883064688682/913519726238527558/pcthing1.png

the-dump 2022-06-01 20:07:20 Oh I’m dumb
creations-chat 2022-06-02 14:54:51 <@914779689745285140> your S1 is alright but there’s no headlight and the leading and trailing trucks don’t touch the ground. Also, you might want to give it it bigger driving wheels when PC2 comes out, as well as improve the motion and pistons.
creations-chat 2022-06-03 00:51:40 you just need to remove the guiders and theyll jsut slide over on curves
creations-chat 2022-06-07 14:12:26 <@456226577798135808> your locomotive is good but you might want to use diamond plate for the metal bits and weather it, and since it’s only an 0-4-0 it would likely just have a 4 wheel tender. If you can, you might also want to add a cab interior, a whistle and bell and piping detail with trail blocks and half wedge blocks.
creations-chat 2022-06-07 14:14:39 He means for people who don’t steal their mom’s credit cards
creations-chat 2022-06-07 14:31:57 Do u r have stupid
creations-chat 2022-06-07 14:35:49 Doesn’t mean every build needs it; there are plenty of slightly less angley vehicles and other things one can buid fine without motorlock
creations-chat 2022-06-07 14:38:51 Saying only 10% of good builds don’t have motorlock is still a vast underestimate and dismissal of traditional building

creations-chat 2022-06-07 14:51:18 If you have to ask since your unsure of something so obvious, clearly you do as well, perhaps even more so than myself

creations-chat 2022-06-07 14:55:33 Building large chunks of vehicles that fold together like boats and trains is hard, especially tediously adding detail and color over the whole thing and ensuring it’s folds together right and having to delete half of it if you misalign something by 1 block in the fold
creations-chat 2022-06-07 14:58:15 Ok then go get shipwright IV
<@793132196810588200> sometimes with how the build is layed out you can’t predict how the folds would work
creations-chat 2022-06-07 15:00:57 Why would you keep your designer rank but not your shipwright rank after ban?
Then how did you get designer again
They gave it to you after your ban with a build you posted before your big fuckey-wuckey?
creations-chat 2022-06-07 15:04:04 I don’t see why they would take that away and then give that to you after anyways
creations-chat 2022-06-07 15:06:22 Ok I guess
creations-chat 2022-06-07 15:15:09 I thought you didn’t have shipwright based on weird ranking procedures. You’re telling me it was no problem for you to get shipwright?
creations-chat 2022-06-07 16:37:51 fine then I'll get it

contest-chat 2022-06-08 21:48:29 In the part where koalas live most of it is desert
contest-chat 2022-06-08 21:51:30 We can do locomotives designated as j class right
contest-chat 2022-06-08 21:52:01 That is the actual name
contest-chat 2022-06-08 21:52:12 The class designation
contest-chat 2022-06-08 21:53:40 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/locomotive/images/6/6d/PRR_6432.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20180524065629 here’s a few
contest-chat 2022-06-08 21:55:03 Doesn’t matter since that logic doesn’t apply to jets unless you reverse that rule <:trollface:775024642104229898>
contest-chat 2022-06-08 21:56:59 I mean maybe you could refer to them, in the order of the pictures, a northern, Hudson and Texas, but those are just nicknames of the wheel arrangements used by those classes. Most locomotives aren’t formally named.
contest-chat 2022-06-08 21:58:08 I mean the first locomotive has been named “Sprit of Roanoke” in preservation but even then the class name is still often used
contest-chat 2022-06-08 21:58:24 That’s the same thing it’s the class name
contest-chat 2022-06-08 21:58:43 Yeah a letter and number
contest-chat 2022-06-08 21:59:07 What this

contest-chat 2022-06-08 22:02:44 It’s not cheating it’s literally what it is referred to as
contest-chat 2022-06-08 22:03:41 If you’re rejecting trains for that reason all jets are then valid
contest-chat 2022-06-08 22:03:58 Needs to START with j
contest-chat 2022-06-08 22:04:15 So you’re reversing that rule?
contest-chat 2022-06-08 22:04:34 What is that
contest-chat 2022-06-08 22:05:11 You said people can’t make jets even though it starts with J
contest-chat 2022-06-08 22:05:28 What did you say
contest-chat 2022-06-08 22:06:01 *insert dropping soap in the shower meme here*
contest-chat 2022-06-08 22:07:00 So the trains I showed are aloud?
contest-chat 2022-06-08 22:07:15 LETS GO
contest-chat 2022-06-08 22:07:29 The class is designated as that it does
contest-chat 2022-06-08 22:08:04 Trains aren’t given actual names that often
contest-chat 2022-06-08 22:08:50 Most just have numbers so companies can keep track but that isn’t what they really “start” with, numbers aren’t always what people first think
contest-chat 2022-06-08 22:10:44 Time to make a J class of the N&W, #611
contest-chat 2022-06-08 22:11:28 The first one I showed you

contest-chat 2022-06-08 22:22:07 Just for her to determine the exact number

contest-chat 2022-06-08 22:23:44 That’s just letters he could’ve at least made a mech of him
contest-chat 2022-06-08 22:27:16 Yeah there is
contest-chat 2022-06-08 22:27:30 WAIT THEY HAVENT SAID THAT
contest-chat 2022-06-08 22:27:55 Why wouldn’t they say that?
contest-chat 2022-06-08 22:28:44 You lied to me
contest-chat 2022-06-08 22:29:20 Oh
contest-chat 2022-06-08 22:30:12 Unless it’s 3D
contest-chat 2022-06-08 22:30:37 Make a map with terrain height and buildings and you should be fine
contest-chat 2022-06-08 22:31:04 John Wick
contest-chat 2022-06-08 22:31:46 No motorlock is overused and overrated
contest-chat 2022-06-08 22:31:54 It should be sufficient built normally
contest-chat 2022-06-08 22:32:03 That’d have barely any detail
contest-chat 2022-06-08 22:32:42 *are you trying to sabotage a fellow competitor?*
contest-chat 2022-06-08 22:33:10 Because you absolutely can there’s nothing against it in the rules
contest-chat 2022-06-08 22:33:27 Just make it big you could fit so much more detail in and no motorlock

contest-chat 2022-06-09 03:47:42 I just realized the J classes have tapered boilers
contest-chat 2022-06-09 03:48:04 *this is gonna be soooo fuuuuun*
contest-chat 2022-06-09 03:52:03 You know maybe J-3-A class C&O 614 would be better it doesn’t have bullet nose or tapered boiler
contest-chat 2022-06-09 03:54:43 You can say the word bitch here
contest-chat 2022-06-09 03:55:28 I mean it’s just a few ladders and trials placed cleverly
contest-chat 2022-06-09 03:58:25 Yeah I’ll do the C&O one
contest-chat 2022-06-09 12:05:15 I could also do this one

creations-chat 2022-06-10 14:15:53 Interesting, thank you
<@868389760777977896> fighter jets and cars like the F1 have too many angles to not build them with motorlock unfortunately so you’ll have to learn that
creations-chat 2022-06-10 14:18:27 The way you did it just still doesn’t show the angles the real vehicles have I think
contest-chat 2022-06-10 14:18:43 *jarbage mech
creations-chat 2022-06-10 14:20:38 Well that’s better than me I haven’t tried it at all why else would I only build non-angley stuff
creations-chat 2022-06-10 14:31:29 I mean I can’t do any locking
creations-chat 2022-06-11 00:33:18 <@456226577798135808> that’s a bit better but you still might want to add some weathering and hand rails with trails, maybe add a place for coal on the locomotive if those are just coal cars and not tenders
creations-chat 2022-06-11 00:35:20 I guess I’m blind; maybe have the coal pile stick out the top a little so it’s more obvious?
creations-chat 2022-06-11 00:50:43 No I meant add handrails with trails and weather the build as a whole; also you might want to add a bit more to the cab interior
creations-chat 2022-06-11 00:52:46 I don’t know why you can’t just google it yourself but this just with a cab around it
contest-chat 2022-06-11 00:57:21 That’s the name of the ship the USS is just a title if you do some clever grammar maneuvers it will start with J
creations-chat 2022-06-11 00:58:15 Just do what I do and don’t
contest-chat 2022-06-11 01:00:05 <@466793357318815744> an invalid submission has been added
creations-chat 2022-06-11 01:00:51 Just don’t use any locks in your builds
contest-chat 2022-06-11 01:01:14 It’s Jarbage
contest-chat 2022-06-11 01:01:45 Never mind they fixed it
contest-chat 2022-06-11 01:02:01 What did you do
creations-chat 2022-06-11 03:35:28 Wow that’s really nice

contest-chat 2022-06-12 00:39:33 WT is more p2w and has worse balancing though I like it more with the damage mechanics and planes, I used to play it but my laptop became to crap with the 2.0 update
contest-chat 2022-06-12 00:39:55 What is it
contest-chat 2022-06-12 01:37:21 But they also upped the minimum requirements
contest-chat 2022-06-12 01:38:40 I did try it

contest-chat 2022-06-12 01:39:07 I checked the new requirements and my cpu wasn’t good enough anymore

creations-chat 2022-06-19 23:15:40 <@660219505968152587> do you not know how to scale your builds relative to the environment?

creations-chat 2022-06-21 17:45:32 <@664538133114912783> have you hear of this really cool feature computers have called taking a screenshot
Edit; hit the home and off button at the same time
creations-chat 2022-06-21 17:48:42 Ok so I need feedback on my train consist (I haven’t added cab interior yet and no the pictures I post later won’t be on mobile just these ones)
creations-chat 2022-06-21 17:50:48 And before you say it yes I had to use static siderods and driving wheels because I’m using 6x6 wheels, 5x5 are too small for this locomotive; some of the weathering isn’t visible with the mobile screenshots here but they will show when I take them on PC
creations-chat 2022-06-21 17:53:40 There’s only room for a bobber caboose but I’m fairly sure those were out of service on the C&O by the time 614 (the locomotive here) was built 
<@664538133114912783> hit home button and off button at same time
creations-chat 2022-06-21 17:56:02 He somehow doesn’t know how to screenshot on phone
<@757887014388367401> but I think that’s historically inaccurate
creations-chat 2022-06-21 17:58:40 How does he have the ranks he does at this point without knowing how to take a picture
creations-chat 2022-06-21 18:01:35 I mean the fact he has ranks at all without knowing how to take a picture
creations-chat 2022-06-22 00:29:50 <@887490533990223902> nice truck cab

contest-chat 2022-06-22 04:39:34 Some planes have that classification too
contest-chat 2022-06-22 04:40:26 The train I was originally gonna do I actually remembered was somewhat recently christened with a name so I had to change which one I did (plus that one would’ve been harder)
contest-chat 2022-06-22 04:44:17 It’s overplayed or misviewed at times but not cringe
contest-chat 2022-06-22 04:47:19 Do u r have stupid

creations-chat 2022-07-28 14:30:04 Also don’t use normal train wheels, use cylinders with motors and to keep them on the rails have two 3x3 ice cylinders horizontal between the rails for each axle

creations-chat 2022-08-09 14:54:35 Nobody on the server can that’s no excuse
creations-chat 2022-08-09 15:53:18 If normal mechs are too easy make a transformer or something, there are plenty of other difficult non-anime options too, yeah you're better at it than me because you specialize in it already hence me being better at making trains than you, and as for the last part that's false equivalency because jet builders make jets not mechs, anime mech builders build mechs so it's dumb they make anime shit, if a jet builder wasted their talent on like jets from a stupid cartoon or something
creations-chat 2022-08-09 15:55:49 you just mean flying mechs?

creations-chat 2022-08-10 01:14:01 Yeah he ruined a perfectly good mech setup
creations-chat 2022-08-10 01:20:44 I did if I didn’t I wouldn’t say it’s a good setup or that he has talent
creations-chat 2022-08-10 02:10:51 Yes I do have biases cry about it I can still say it’s an impressive mech design despite the shitty exterior cry about it if you don’t like that
creations-chat 2022-08-10 02:14:12 I thought you were on my side
creations-chat 2022-08-10 03:10:13 fyi I didn't downvote it I reacted with moyai; you know why? because I knew aside from the shitty choice of an exterior it was pretty amazing and high-effort
creations-chat 2022-08-10 04:25:20 A lot less cringe than making an anime body for a perfectly good mech
creations-chat 2022-08-10 04:27:45 Yeah different people specialize in different types of builds with different levels of skill issue big surprise I know
creations-chat 2022-08-10 04:30:03 The first transformers show wasn’t anime which did a good deal of popularizing mechs but ok
<@782711868179480656> I guess we can say that train is the most accurately scaled of all of your’s since it’s narrow gauge
creations-chat 2022-08-10 04:32:51 If you can make the height and width scale with it that’s a fine length
creations-chat 2022-08-10 04:46:30 I didn’t clown it I’m impressed with the scale, detail and design but I can dislike the stylistic choices all I want as anyone can with my builds I just think it’s dumb for someone to spend so many hours on a giant anime thing yes people have different opinions get over yourself
creations-chat 2022-08-10 04:48:35 You mean arguing with others who claimed I was being too harsh for half an hour and am now having to continue?
creations-chat 2022-08-10 04:55:38 I said it was a waste of talent, not time, and yes I defend my own opinions like you’re doing with yours, like you’ve never argued against something with a negative prejudice
creations-chat 2022-08-10 05:01:06 If you used it on a giant anime girl yes it is a waste of talent you clearly have skills with mech building and you use it on, of all things, a giant anime girl for the funni. Why do you have such a problem with me having a different opinion than you? What are you, an alphabet soup person?
creations-chat 2022-08-10 05:03:50 First of all that’s not completely equivalent as I criticized you for using your talent in a certain building area in a niche of it I dislike while you’re critiquing the area as a whole, and second joke’s on you I don’t have any talent
creations-chat 2022-08-10 05:08:08 I said waste of talent not time that’s the second time you’ve fucked that up
<@581500505759416340> yes because you have talent building mechs I just think it’s dumb you use that talent for giant anime girls
<@887490533990223902> <@984694509772357662> who’s helicopter is who’s
creations-chat 2022-08-10 05:10:40 Thanks
<@581500505759416340> you hadn’t mentioned that before while your choice with which to practice locking was questionable I suppose it would be a helpful challenge
creations-chat 2022-08-10 05:13:57 I stopped after rbk told us too, I don’t know why you decided to continue anyway. He could just make a normal humanoid then instead of all things an anime girl, it’s impressive, I just done like the niche he chose. I’m still arguing because you can’t bother accepting I just don’t like that, plain and simple.
creations-chat 2022-08-10 05:17:52 Like I said you have talent you can make cool shit, I just said your choice with which to practice locking is questionable
<@456226577798135808> it’s dumb to try to argue through someone’s biases that’s how biases work, and besides I’ve already admitted several times I’m impressed by multiple parts of it
creations-chat 2022-08-10 05:21:36 Also about what you said earlier about me having no right to judge it; my brother in Christ, the creations and creations chat is meant to be a place where you can get your builds judged by others. If one doesn’t want that they shouldn’t post here. And what am I needing to admitting to be wrong about, that I think it’s dumb to make a giant anime girl while admitting the rest of the build is amazing, high-effort and deserving of praise?
creations-chat 2022-08-10 05:25:18 We’re too deep to turn back now, we gotta keep up creation chat’s reputation, contribute to the community somehow
creations-chat 2022-08-10 05:27:31 Well that was anticlimactic, I was actually looking forward to your dissection, I liked the discussion, but whatever, good night.
creations-chat 2022-08-10 05:31:03 The contribution and reputation part was a joke but given you thought it was serious if anyone’s got stupid brains it’s you
creations-chat 2022-08-10 05:35:10 I rarely argue in this channel actually, today is the only time I can remember, I usually use it for feedback on builds I’m about to post, or questions, compliments or constructive feedback on other’s builds. You’re the one who started this argument.
creations-chat 2022-08-10 05:37:12 Seems like you’re confirming people like you are what makes creations chat the cesspool it is. I hope you’re proud of yourself.
creations-chat 2022-08-10 05:39:18 Yes it was a stupid argument they were continuing something I thought was done and was based on a big misunderstanding you’ve proved you’re no better
creations-chat 2022-08-10 06:13:06 Shut the fuck up I’m not arguing with another guy intentionally misinterpreting my words and shitting on me for having a different opinion
creations-chat 2022-08-10 15:18:23 What am I wrong about having a different opinion? <@456226577798135808> I wasn’t talking to you
<@622607246257422356> you aren’t contributing anything to the argument shut the fuck up
creations-chat 2022-08-10 15:21:00 Creations chat moment that’s what’s going on
creations-chat 2022-08-10 15:24:42 I said I didn’t like part of someone’s build but liked the rest of it and people have been arguing with me saying I’m being too harsh, biased and can’t have a different opinion than them since yesterday
creations-chat 2022-08-10 15:27:19 Not my fault you’re too stupid to tell what it is
creations-chat 2022-08-10 15:30:39 I didn’t even downvote said build
Also why are you talking about this other person with making trains when they posted a space cruiser or something (wait I’m stupid it’s a small-scale train station not a space cruiser)
creations-chat 2022-08-10 15:34:23 Ok cool
creations-chat 2022-08-10 15:37:44 I talked about the build and said it’s stupid they used they’re amazing mech skills on a giant anime girl
creations-chat 2022-08-10 15:40:33 Fair enough I suppose I did start this in a way and this isn’t an argument you really should get caught up in
<@914605911744593930> that’s just how creations chat works
<@410455661814480896> shut the fuck up just admit you were proven wrong that the train in my PFP is pretty clear what it is
creations-chat 2022-08-10 15:43:30 First of all you’re blind second what did you think it was at first then (don’t say the ha-ha funny special toy)
creations-chat 2022-08-10 15:45:58 I guess you’re just too *special* to tell then everyone else can tell fine you two are literally the only people here I have ever met that are too stupid to figure out what it is, and also he only said it looks like that one dude (whatever that means), not that he couldn’t tell it was a train
creations-chat 2022-08-10 16:16:31 Where’d he say that
creations-chat 2022-08-10 16:18:52 *just look at those curves*
creations-chat 2022-08-11 00:57:57 Oh that looks niiiiice
creations-chat 2022-08-11 01:03:12 You seriously think I don’t remember you? I’m pretty fucking stupid but not that much.
creations-chat 2022-08-11 01:06:29 Also “Expert Designer [V]” now shut the fuck up
creations-chat 2022-08-11 01:13:25 Can you please stop wasting oxygen and kindly fuck off
creations-chat 2022-08-11 01:22:29 Trollmerica fuck yeah
creations-chat 2022-08-15 01:31:42 <@456226577798135808> I recommend you don't have the cab roof and tender attached but otherwise your train and the last one you posted too is really nice
creations-chat 2022-08-15 01:33:52 have the cab and tender two blocks apart then maybe?
creations-chat 2022-08-15 01:35:57 ik but it looks like it
creations-chat 2022-08-15 01:39:30 oh yeah that looks a lot better
creations-chat 2022-08-15 01:55:00 “They’re the same picture.”
creations-chat 2022-08-16 00:56:14 <@456226577798135808> nice big boy but you might want to try a 5x5 boiler, maybe 4x4 centered with a piston if that’s too big; 3x3 looks too small
creations-chat 2022-08-16 01:01:32 If you say so
creations-chat 2022-08-16 01:38:03 Ok that makes more sense
creations-chat 2022-08-16 18:17:21 <@787582244381655051> looks more like self-propelled artillery but ok
creations-chat 2022-08-16 18:19:29 your custom tank you posted looks like what I said, what did you think I meant?
contest-chat 2022-08-19 05:29:16 20th century steampunk
contest-chat 2022-08-19 05:29:25 looks like ima make a fantasy steam locomotive
contest-chat 2022-08-19 05:30:03 *and I once again have to go through the pain of getting the train to go around the dogshit overly-sharp curve design*
contest-chat 2022-08-19 05:31:43 well at least I have an excuse to do simple motion because steam turbines<:clueless:942802644043464734>
contest-chat 2022-08-19 20:33:37 If I basically combine these two and add more technology that was canceled or cut short due to the advent of diesel power that counts right
contest-chat 2022-08-19 20:47:50 Steampunk M67 and/or Huey?
contest-chat 2022-08-19 21:50:04 Those are the same thing
contest-chat 2022-08-19 21:50:37 I’m just making a steam locomotive but better
contest-chat 2022-08-19 21:55:27 <@466793357318815744> just to be safe this is a valid idea right
contest-chat 2022-08-19 22:01:19 Jus remember you’re never half as much as I am
contest-chat 2022-08-19 22:26:25 Yeah
contest-chat 2022-08-20 00:33:42 That’s literally just a helicopter with wired colors and shapes
contest-chat 2022-08-20 00:34:15 A personification of yourself then?
bot-central 2022-08-21 05:09:15 -servers
contest-chat 2022-08-21 16:41:44 I hate to break to you buddy but I seriously doubt that’s steam powered
contest-chat 2022-08-22 03:31:17 Ah yes steam turbine jet engine
contest-chat 2022-08-22 03:31:21 Wait
contest-chat 2022-08-22 03:31:26 That could actually potentially work
contest-chat 2022-08-22 03:31:49 Steam spins the turbine with is connected to a prop or something
contest-chat 2022-08-22 03:32:01 But the thrust probably wouldn’t be enough to lift a heavy firebox and boiler
contest-chat 2022-08-22 04:52:51 I’m kinda combining the PRR S2, proposed Lima 4-8-6, articulation, autocoach reverse running and water condensing to form the ultimate 4-6-6-6 steam turbine locomotive
contest-chat 2022-08-22 05:42:15 *“3 what? Hours? Days?”*
contest-chat 2022-08-22 14:06:49 Uncultured swine. In a steampunk world trains are the thing that would make the most sense
contest-chat 2022-08-22 14:07:30 Then you’re even more uncultured than I thought
contest-chat 2022-08-22 14:08:35 How the fuck is this boring?
contest-chat 2022-08-22 14:09:07 Or this?
contest-chat 2022-08-22 14:10:55 So just Bullied’s 2 experimental locomotivess?
contest-chat 2022-08-22 14:11:37 Sounds interesting
contest-chat 2022-08-22 14:12:19 
contest-chat 2022-08-22 14:12:27 Yeah
contest-chat 2022-08-22 14:13:50 Well for part of my design I’m using technology that was underutilized, and also cut short or cancelled by diesels
contest-chat 2022-08-22 14:14:29 Steam turbine, Lima’s hyperpower concept, water condensing, GWR auto coach technology…
contest-chat 2022-08-22 14:14:47 You might be able to use some of that?
contest-chat 2022-08-22 14:16:39 So a steam-electric? Those existed and likely could’ve been successful if done right
contest-chat 2022-08-22 14:16:52 That could be interesting
contest-chat 2022-08-22 14:17:22 I mean
contest-chat 2022-08-22 14:17:26 Not necessarily
contest-chat 2022-08-22 14:17:37 You’d still need to control the water, fuel and steam flow
contest-chat 2022-08-22 14:18:13 You wouldn’t need stuff for the motion but a lot of the stuff had to dtay
contest-chat 2022-08-22 14:19:18 Basically a double-chambered belpaire firebox that needs a six-wheel trailing truck. Hyperpower isn’t an official name, I just gave it since it’s an upgrade of Lima’s “superpower” designs
contest-chat 2022-08-22 14:20:14 ||yeah I’m using it to put a second cab in the tender rear for reverse running, upgraded where it can have gauges and stuff too so both crew are in the same place.||
contest-chat 2022-08-22 14:21:12 Yeah
contest-chat 2022-08-22 14:21:23 Shame they never made a demonstrator unit
contest-chat 2022-08-22 14:21:42 It was designed in 1949 but never built with the advent of diesel locomotives
contest-chat 2022-08-22 14:22:08 Ok
contest-chat 2022-08-22 14:22:55 What can I say I have severe autism
contest-chat 2022-08-22 14:23:41 Ok not severe but still autistic
contest-chat 2022-08-22 15:00:56 Yeah they look broad gauge
contest-chat 2022-08-22 15:01:39 Yeah I just scale mine up but you could do something like that
contest-chat 2022-08-22 16:21:29 <@466793357318815744> I already have a design so
contest-chat 2022-08-22 16:22:08 No giant cannon or trains with aircraft engines
contest-chat 2022-08-22 16:25:09 How do you make a steampunk flag?

contest-chat 2022-08-25 22:13:44 <@712273624865701921> since you want my locomotive streamlined do you want it to have skyline casing or not I'm not sure
contest-chat 2022-08-25 22:48:04 Perhaps

creations-chat 2022-08-27 23:20:55 Is this any good
creations-chat 2022-08-28 00:13:01 very specific on all the problems you pointed out I hadn't noticed, thank you
creations-chat 2022-08-28 00:16:44 what
contest-chat 2022-08-28 01:14:03 it doesn't look any more modern than this
contest-chat 2022-08-28 01:15:51 so?
contest-chat 2022-08-28 01:16:37 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GWR_Autocoach
contest-chat 2022-08-28 01:18:00 *it's streamlined, popular in the art deco era which is in the 20th century*
contest-chat 2022-08-28 01:19:23 it's steam developed beyond what it was IRL that's steampunk
contest-chat 2022-08-28 01:19:34 it's not weatehred because it's streamlined
contest-chat 2022-08-28 01:20:00 yeah steam turbines were a thing then dumbfuck
contest-chat 2022-08-28 01:20:06 that's steampunk
contest-chat 2022-08-28 01:21:09 they existed they just never got off the ground because diesel locmotives came around
contest-chat 2022-08-28 01:21:57 two-tone schemes were pretty popular, sometimes one-tone
contest-chat 2022-08-28 01:22:07 no... they have combustion engines...
contest-chat 2022-08-28 01:22:51 what's wrong besides color scheme there's piping everwhere and little details
contest-chat 2022-08-28 01:26:12 the water condensors, pipes going into around and under the boiler, bogie frames...
contest-chat 2022-08-28 04:44:44 <@588596347272167456> 
You know streamlined trains are ones they try to keep clean since they’re supposed to look nice right?
Steam turbine locomotives likely would’ve been further pursued if not for diesels but ok bro
The blue and white is a rough replica of a real color scheme
I didn’t want to make this for a while I thought I was done until PC2 came out but then the competition interested me. Not everything can be technically visible. And I did change the looks good luck finding one that looks the same
contest-chat 2022-08-28 04:47:27 You’re supposed to make what something steampunk from the 20th century would be… eg, if steam technology continued developing with the absence of combustion engine
contest-chat 2022-08-28 04:49:28 Do u r have stupid
contest-chat 2022-08-28 04:50:31 What do you thinks those giant pipes along the boiler are for
contest-chat 2022-08-28 04:51:18 Yeah I’ve seen steampunk vehicles meant to look art-decoey and doesn’t change the fact it doesn’t look like a diesel
contest-chat 2022-08-28 04:52:20 It has a giant pile of coal in it blindass
contest-chat 2022-08-28 04:52:37 Air compressors? Those are short cylinders, not pipes
contest-chat 2022-08-28 04:53:13 The wheels? The exhaust? The cab layout?
contest-chat 2022-08-28 04:54:06 It has a streamlined shroud in the front the cab is in the back of the locomotive
contest-chat 2022-08-28 04:54:18 And?
contest-chat 2022-08-28 04:55:48 Would you rather them be silver?
contest-chat 2022-08-28 04:56:23 
contest-chat 2022-08-28 04:56:38 They’re the same other than color
contest-chat 2022-08-28 04:56:47 And how do you round motors?
contest-chat 2022-08-28 04:57:55 You mean put a half cylinder over them? You can’t truly hide them without the siderods being bulkier than your mom’s bed supports
contest-chat 2022-08-28 04:58:39 Because people don’t know what the shit I listed is?
contest-chat 2022-08-28 04:59:21 What do you think the giant cylinders are
contest-chat 2022-08-28 04:59:41 The firebox on it that’s the size of your mom
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:00:41 You can clearly see there cab on the tender and water condensing things on the side
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:01:12 That’s not what a radiator is
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:01:33 It takes the steam and turns it back into water for efficiency for reuse
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:01:39 The giant grates
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:02:25 You asked a question and I answered it
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:02:40 For fucks sake there are a bunch of other things
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:03:07 It clearly did not my fault you’re blind
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:03:54 Because it’s *art deco streamlined* look up Art Deco steampunk
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:04:08 it was black against white
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:04:36 That looks ugly as hell
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:05:56 You asked like 3 questions and I answered them
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:06:24 The frog is miles worse
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:06:59 That’s literally what steampunk means dipshit
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:07:31 It’s both
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:07:56 Pretty sure flying machines are post 1800s but sure buddy
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:08:12 How is it not also a concept?
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:08:29 Everything being steam powered is a concept
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:08:41 Steam not being overtaken by combustion engines is a concept
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:09:24 Combustion means fuel goes in, gets ignited to move pistons around like gasoline or diesel
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:09:48 Yeah there’s “combustion” in a steam engine but it’s not nearly the same
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:10:23 Yeah see it’s different
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:10:50 Fire heats water to make steam to push piston, combustion puts fuel by piston and ignites it
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:10:54 They’re very different
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:11:23 That means they’re different dipshit
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:11:44 Like not what someone thinks of when they hear “combustion engine”
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:11:50 Yeah there’s combustion in the fire
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:12:05 But when people say combustion engine they think gasoline or diesel
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:12:32 Your little buddy started this don’t blame me
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:12:56 *but everyone always thinks of the FORMER*
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:13:05 I already told you
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:13:30 Doesn’t matter it’s what people use so that’s effectively what it is
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:13:38 Even if not technically
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:13:49 It quite literally is
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:13:58 Gay can mean happy but no one uses it like that
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:14:09 It technically means happy but not effectively
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:15:05 Because I proved you wrong with definitions?
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:15:33 Then stop distracting me with your bullshit
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:15:50 So are you
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:16:18 You said you wanted it streamlined
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:17:51 That’s the same as mine with less pipes and the shrouding sloped
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:17:53 And smaller
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:18:07 Haha idiot fell for it twice
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:18:53 I sent you an image of one
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:19:29 Then tell them to stop
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:20:33 I just thought people would understand Art Deco streamlining on it because 20th century was in the contest I guess not
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:21:25 Look I’ll start fixing it tomorrow I get your point
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:26:36 I change mine down by like 20, splash that in a few places and then add bits of corroded metal because I’m lazy
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:27:28 *gonna cry?*
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:27:46 Because Art Deco since 20th century but ok
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:28:13 They’re not incompatible
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:28:23 They’re not
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:29:01 20th century includes Art Deco
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:29:27 *I fear no man, but that… THING… it scares me…*
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:30:07 Yeah that’s what I’m gonna do since y’all are crying about it so hard
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:30:32 Theres 2 submission per person
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:30:56 I can just take off the streamlining, weather and add a few things
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:31:11 Bot already registered it
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:31:24 I did take 20th century concepts
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:33:52 I proved mine fits you guys just don’t like it
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:34:48 It’s steam powered? It has more advanced steam technology?
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:35:13 I explained the other part
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:35:43 Yeah it *looks* like it because I added streamlining
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:36:21 It literally is I put Art Deco streamlining on it because 20th century
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:36:39 If I removed streamlining it would look more the part
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:37:28 It’s steam powered and used more developed steam technology that never got to where it is irl
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:39:11 Because it wasn’t built like steam continued developing like what steampunk is
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:39:24 Flying steam powered vehicles?
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:40:02 No shut
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:40:43 Even if it’s diesel powered it’s steampunk purely based on asthetics?
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:41:22 So the steam part doesn’t matter at all?
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:41:31 It’s both
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:43:17 If it had steam as s significant part then it is but not if it has none at all
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:43:58 Too dumb to read I see

creations-chat 2022-08-31 21:33:08 <@905792103014076447> your Class 37 is alright but your GTEL and S-3 have a few problems. The GTEL seems a little small; it works for the 37 because the Bri’ish are too cheap to upgrade their loading gauge but for the GTEL it makes it look off. Also try to make the nose look less angly. As for the S-3 you tried way too hard with the valve gear; it extending out three blocks does NOT work at that scale in the slightest. Just add a piston rod, have the valve gear be static and not go out as far. Also, be sure to add weathering (bits of darker color and corroded metal) in your builds and have the guiders be 3x3 and ice instead of 1x1 on motors for smoother riding and less lag

creations-chat 2022-09-03 14:28:02 What is “satisfish” and that doesn’t explain the coloring and texturing. You can make it stop enemy fire without it looking like a cancer tumor, this isn’t build a boat for treasure.

creations-chat 2022-09-22 23:58:51 <@916734024746147880> can you give it a livery
creations-chat 2022-09-23 19:17:38 <@937406148670267453> you should probably add bogie detail since the wheels looks bad by themselves, and maybe make the thing at a bigger scale so it doesn’t stick out awkwardly otherwise it’s good. I also recommend using cylinders and motors rather than the default train wheels since they suck.

creations-chat 2023-02-20 18:05:18 Change the color you use by 10 up and down by different amounts, use that on a few blocks, and repeat until it looks somewhat (but not too) varied, maybe some smaller bits of rust too
creations-chat 2023-02-20 20:18:57 Would ➗look better for rivets?
creations-chat 2023-02-22 02:10:29 looks good
creations-chat 2023-02-22 02:48:27 too concentrated, should be spread out
creations-chat 2023-02-25 22:47:48 <@988013744888107028> the train is too narrow and height-short relative to the track, the nose looks kinda weird and it lacks bogie frames, also color scheme is too neon
creations-chat 2023-02-26 15:03:37 <@769930993867948042> it has potential, just scale it up, add bogie frames, give it less sharp colors, weather it, and add more smaller details on the locomotive, maybe interiors if you feel like it
creations-chat 2023-02-26 17:10:15 It’s more glossy though, yours looks neon
creations-chat 2023-02-27 23:16:57 <@1006548230152126586> why would you make a sandwich with just a single slice of cheese and nothing , that's barely even a sandwhich
creations-chat 2023-03-04 14:13:56 <@567763933952475157> I think you were build a British Rail Class 47 Brush Traction Type 4 diesel-electric locomotive

creations-chat 2023-07-02 14:45:21 <@1115257102219358219> phenomenal Hudson, my only criticisms would be that the motion should be silver/gray and the lack of a cab interior (which may not be possible due to interior motorlock)
creations-chat 2023-07-02 14:47:24 Oh yeah I remember that, it was cool, I’m planning on building a TCL consist myself at track scale
