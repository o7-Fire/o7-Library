creations-chat 2023-01-06 13:22:25 could anyone help me with making the treads less thicc?
creations-chat 2023-01-07 09:04:08 accurate
creations-chat 2023-01-08 09:40:37 its funi
creations-chat 2023-01-08 09:42:39 whats so wrong about it anyways, why does it offend you in such a way you need to downvote it
creations-chat 2023-01-08 09:45:01 explain how, i need feedback if you want it to improve
creations-chat 2023-01-08 10:33:34 its a mini build bruh, what do you mean low effort
creations-chat 2023-01-08 10:38:48 fair point, but i also dont see how this is feedback, this is more just insults
creations-chat 2023-01-08 10:47:36 W
creations-chat 2023-01-08 10:58:40 im not very familiar with the X02S but from what i see they might need to be a little closer together depending on how big you want it
creations-chat 2023-01-08 11:00:45 i see, well i'd say make the landing gear and then from there you can tell how far apart they should be by lookin at a reference image but other than that looks goodüëç
creations-chat 2023-01-08 11:15:43 right
creations-chat 2023-01-09 06:25:11 <@817489867017551883> i'd say work on the wings of the F-14 so they dont look they're hanging on by a thread, also i didnt delete it it said i was swearing for some reason
creations-chat 2023-01-09 06:29:27 one way to fix that issue is by making the wing more straight like this  top image for example then putting an indent on the side of the fuselage so your wing can still fold like so
creations-chat 2023-01-09 06:38:59 i would post mine but i feel like it would get bullied
creations-chat 2023-01-09 06:41:18 o k

creations-chat 2023-01-09 06:54:16 bruh everyone on this server is to talented with this stuff, the best i can do on my mini builds is a half wedge in front of the seat and thats my cockpit instruments
creations-chat 2023-01-09 07:30:02 or hold the key then type in chat
creations-chat 2023-01-11 11:07:19 me too, i can see effort in the build but it just dosent look like an F-16
creations-chat 2023-01-12 17:16:58 jets are overmade, make a car bomb
creations-chat 2023-01-12 17:19:05 make the wings and intakes of the F-14 and make those fly, not the rest of it just the wings and intake
creations-chat 2023-01-12 17:44:55 never thought of it like that
creations-chat 2023-01-12 17:47:43 WHAT IF IM JUST HOLDING SHIFT YOU DONT KNOW

creations-chat 2023-02-02 09:49:59 you can see it dosent use M2M so its basically just a mini SU-27M
creations-chat 2023-02-02 09:52:03 reason #1 you should ask to be the one to hold the starting revolver ^
creations-chat 2023-02-02 09:54:15 bro it took me a minute to figure out he was blocking his jet and that wasnt just the build itself
creations-chat 2023-02-02 10:01:19 if you want tips of how to level up enough to get image perms do what i did, get in an arguement on if a human or a cow would win 1 to 1 for an hour
creations-chat 2023-02-02 10:03:26 if you were wondering the majority vote was sidestep the cow till it runs out of stamina
creations-chat 2023-02-02 10:28:11 this is a public channel
creations-chat 2023-02-02 12:45:49 this sentence does not make you look like the good guy, it makes you look stuck up
creations-chat 2023-02-02 12:49:39 creations chat is where casual players go to die of insults
bot-central 2023-02-02 13:22:54 !rank
creations-chat 2023-02-02 13:43:06 why must you downvote instead of upvote
creations-chat 2023-02-02 13:48:11 understandable
creations-chat 2023-02-02 13:59:36 sorry no offense but the gear is way to small for a jet that big
creations-chat 2023-02-02 14:02:15 all im saying is he was saying the gear is bad
creations-chat 2023-02-02 14:04:55 1: i dont really wanna answer the question anymore since you're yelling at me for no reason. 2: if you really want advice then here ya go, make it more straight like the blueprint
creations-chat 2023-02-02 14:06:58 and yet you attack me for answering your question cause everyone else is acting mean to you, i see how it is
creations-chat 2023-02-02 14:09:00 it was your question actually, i get what you mean though this server has some really awful guys
creations-chat 2023-02-02 14:12:29 idk man, maybe they just need someone to pick on to feel good about their lives, you know the classic bully. guess thats why they call it cyber bullying
creations-chat 2023-02-03 01:04:55 im lookin for advice on how to make it better if you were willing to do that
creations-chat 2023-02-03 01:10:08 Well personally I like mini builds more than big builds.
creations-chat 2023-02-03 01:18:26 does a feature to make its ammunition explode count as detail?
creations-chat 2023-02-03 08:03:57 <@682147422218223616> i have several questions. 1: why did you post a screenshot from a youtube video. 2: is that even your video
creations-chat 2023-02-03 09:03:13 still dosent answer the 1st question though
help 2023-02-03 10:14:17 i'd say the best way to help that is just small proppellers on the ends of each wing that can roll you left and right
creations-chat 2023-02-03 11:56:03 "just cause you have a rank now does not mean you are above everyone else" very humble of you
creations-chat 2023-02-03 11:58:18 saying a rank means nothing yet you make fun of white names
creations-chat 2023-02-03 12:00:23 All I said was I'm not a white name anymore as I am not, I am a blue name as you can see.
creations-chat 2023-02-03 12:02:30 No I'm saying I don't have a white name anymore, my name is not white.
creations-chat 2023-02-03 12:04:32 I am stating the fact that my username is no longer white.
creations-chat 2023-02-03 12:06:50 I am stating the fact that my username is no longer white.
creations-chat 2023-02-03 12:09:07 I am now stating the fact that my username is white and is no longer blue.
creations-chat 2023-02-03 12:11:19 well nothings wrong with my name being white so why not, i became an expert because i decided to apply for expert
creations-chat 2023-02-03 12:15:26 Maybe the real conversation was the friends we made along the way.
creations-chat 2023-02-03 13:34:13 lol
help 2023-02-03 13:46:01 honestly not sure why it does that but a possible fix might be placing vertical and horizontal control surfaces for stabilization

creations-chat 2023-02-07 07:52:23 i see no problems with it other than the fact its an E variant <:trollface:775024642104229898>

creations-chat 2023-02-07 07:56:32 and yet EA made battlefront 2. I cant decide whether to hate or like them<:nooo:787097964946259978>
creations-chat 2023-02-07 07:59:24 the cockpit is just so small on the E variant
creations-chat 2023-02-07 08:02:15 Its your preference really, keep it the E variant if you want I just personally think the F variant looks better.
