creations-chat 2019-04-06 11:53:37 
creations-chat 2019-04-06 11:53:53 I made my maus. It isn't much but...
creations-chat 2019-04-06 12:54:53 It's not a drone if your inside of it
creations-chat 2019-04-06 12:55:03 This is just a hovering creation
creations-chat 2019-04-14 21:08:23 Above is a well-cultured man. But It'd be more impressive if you made the device it was designed to be dropped out of. <@!462814636920799252>
creations-chat 2019-04-16 23:11:31 You mean lancaster?
creations-chat 2019-04-16 23:31:34 Lancaster has negotiable amounts of prop blades
creations-chat 2019-04-25 20:26:43 How does that look like the halo protagonist and why are there weapons where there shouldn't be? <@!466793357318815744> ?
creations-chat 2019-04-25 20:27:52 But why are there guns on the props?
creations-chat 2019-04-25 20:28:37 Also, rockets on top?
creations-chat 2019-04-25 20:29:58 One final thing.
creations-chat 2019-04-25 20:30:53 If I am correct, the front facing guns make it a Medium Bomber/long range bomber/ attack plane?
creations-chat 2019-04-25 20:31:10 Such as the B-24 and 25
creations-chat 2019-04-25 20:31:51 I was planning to make the heavy bomber from BF1 soon.
creations-chat 2019-04-25 20:31:58 I forget the real name.
creations-chat 2019-04-25 20:43:17 Da.
bug-reports 2019-04-25 20:44:29 SILENCE FURRY INFADEL!
creations-chat 2019-04-30 20:26:32 The vampires wings were bigger though.
creations-chat 2019-04-30 20:27:18 I have a maus, and it's to scale ish
creations-chat 2019-04-30 20:27:31 a bit too tall but length-width are good
creations-chat 2019-04-30 20:27:42 
creations-chat 2019-04-30 20:28:00 We got into a big argument over it.
creations-chat 2019-04-30 20:28:13 As the server was butthurt over it existing.
creations-chat 2019-04-30 20:29:14 This isn't a submission
creations-chat 2019-04-30 20:29:48 <@!251995895405477888>  Your panther isn't too panther like.
creations-chat 2019-04-30 20:30:36 To counter argue please @ me

For micro engineer or whatever the fuck its called.
creations-chat 2019-04-30 20:36:05 
creations-chat 2019-05-01 20:01:09 Your body also. <@!251995895405477888>  The panther turret never had sloped cheeks as well
creations-chat 2019-05-01 20:18:32 Panther turrets were flat except for the hole where the half-circular mount for the Pak 40 could be mounted and fit through.
creations-chat 2019-05-01 20:18:51 Also the back has too much slope and the exhaust pipes pointed down.
creations-chat 2019-05-01 20:19:50 Small particles did exit the top of the engine as well, though so "exhaust" exited through the radiator too.

help 2019-05-21 23:36:04 How do I make a train that follows the tracks?
help 2019-05-22 00:39:12 I meant how to set it up
creations-chat 2019-05-22 20:07:08 <@!467877403172274217>  I apologize, but to me that is not a MiG-15 in the slightest. Regards Mr. Worldwide
creations-chat 2019-05-22 20:08:29 It's much too long. The tail and wings are scuffed. If you want I could help with a better, more sleek design.
creations-chat 2019-05-22 20:09:59 And I don't mean any offense, as it's not the best when I make planes but I can still make them.
creations-chat 2019-05-22 20:10:12 Just as you.
creations-chat 2019-05-22 20:10:44 Because I have made something similar
creations-chat 2019-05-22 20:11:18 I also did make an exceptionally proportional bomber.
creations-chat 2019-05-22 20:11:47 I am better with ground vehicles however.
creations-chat 2019-05-22 20:12:07 I will soon.
creations-chat 2019-05-22 20:12:21 I must do something first.

creations-chat 2019-06-02 19:26:17 like

creations-chat 2019-06-02 19:26:33 It looks amateur.
creations-chat 2019-06-02 19:27:25 I don't see any upvotes on your creation
creations-chat 2019-06-02 19:27:39 Also
creations-chat 2019-06-02 19:27:49 It doesn't show how many blocks your plane is.
creations-chat 2019-06-02 19:27:50 So
creations-chat 2019-06-02 19:27:58 It'd be impossible to approve this.
