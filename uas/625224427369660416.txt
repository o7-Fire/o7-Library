creations-chat 2021-01-09 11:25:23 Gee, this is more of a warzone than reddit
creations-chat 2021-01-09 11:27:26 The Original from the Sequal movies has a Red engine, so i thought since the normal Original TIEs use Green for lasers n all it would be fitting
creations-chat 2021-01-09 11:29:26 Thx, u as well Blueparrot
creations-chat 2021-01-09 12:44:52 Who wouldve thought
creations-chat 2021-01-09 13:13:21 Is it normal that most jets get so many dislikes, is it cuz theres so many of em or why

creations-chat 2021-01-10 18:50:45 The whole server bullying Kajtek
creations-chat 2021-01-10 19:19:26 A question unanswered for the millenia
creations-chat 2021-01-10 19:21:33 <@452553727912574996> Too big for a TIE

creations-chat 2021-01-10 19:38:22 (when i said tutorial i meant EnterByter, dunno abour Maurinis's)
creations-chat 2021-01-10 19:51:41 I bet "Jabbas Palace" would have more dislikes if it didnt have a Starwars Name in it
creations-chat 2021-01-10 20:16:51 Anyone got Feedback for my shuttle? <#384025409945337856>

creations-chat 2021-01-11 08:37:12 Well every time i take a peek in it i only see people that are basically "Im an Aiihole so its automaticly funny"
creations-chat 2021-01-11 09:23:44 Nobody cares
creations-chat 2021-01-11 09:31:01 Ironic
creations-chat 2021-01-11 09:34:08 Does "Ironic" mean you cant speak?
creations-chat 2021-01-11 09:36:09 It means if ya talk Bull, you get Bull. Dont act Suprised.

creations-chat 2021-01-11 13:17:42 Throws at face*
creations-chat 2021-01-11 13:22:36 Cuz its unique, has cool colours and special details, floats etc. **Laughs in "Its the build of an already existing tank" **
creations-chat 2021-01-11 19:57:19 Gonna be honest, kinda looks like a railgun with a turret taped on top
creations-chat 2021-01-11 20:01:25 It looks like it
creations-chat 2021-01-11 20:05:21 Hold on
creations-chat 2021-01-11 20:17:42 <@419809339000356874> Kinda like this, just not as long
creations-chat 2021-01-14 10:58:17 Funny how Pixal art with the Minecraft brand on it gets more likes than a lot of high effort builds
creations-chat 2021-01-14 14:27:29 So like 20 different coloured blocks stacked next to eachother with no pourpose whatsoever isnt?
creations-chat 2021-01-14 21:18:12 Anyone got some Advice on "Folding" builds? Cuz every time i try the second part goes out of place and it just looks like the ship is being held together by tape. Do i use magnets or something?
creations-chat 2021-01-17 19:29:13 HOW
creations-chat 2021-01-23 12:09:35 <@404306161899143192> is that the Shredderbug Queen

creations-chat 2021-01-26 15:27:25 How mature to just downvote everything from everyone just cuz ya can >. >)
creations-chat 2021-01-26 15:30:17 <@601802691173416970>

creations-chat 2021-01-27 20:05:43 🤔
creations-chat 2021-01-27 20:15:43 People always do it
creations-chat 2021-01-28 06:39:43 You do know that ranks dont determine your building skill do you? F***in amateur...
creations-chat 2021-01-28 06:43:27 You're just jealous of the Upvotes cuz nobody likes your crappy Mechs n ships lmao
creations-chat 2021-01-28 06:48:03 Fair enough<:kek:652566605028524033>
creations-chat 2021-01-28 07:26:06 Hes also getting roasted somewhere else?
creations-chat 2021-01-28 07:31:32 What chat? General?
creations-chat 2021-01-28 07:36:22 What a prick. Toxic, Jealous, Bitter, how sad.
(Also what server did he get banned from? Another Plane crazy?)
creations-chat 2021-01-28 08:25:16 He apparently got banned from another server for being toxic as well <:PepeLaugh:697130830081818634>
creations-chat 2021-01-28 08:44:17 For most people PlaneCrazy is a lot of fun but its more of a One-Time Once-in-a-while thing
creations-chat 2021-01-28 17:14:51 How comes you didnt downvote your own stuff yet then 🤔
creations-chat 2021-01-28 17:16:52 Lmao
creations-chat 2021-01-28 17:18:55 Message in message channel
creations-chat 2021-02-02 19:56:41 <@!773699011059908640> that doesnt look like Gold,that looks like someone threw a yellow bucket of paint on it,try a more Yellow-orange'y colour and use some Light blocks with a different yellow-orange shade. also make the blade just orange
creations-chat 2021-02-02 20:00:39 If people dont like it,they dont like it.They dont have to/or want to explain why they dont like it with every downvoted creation.(also i kinda explained why)
creations-chat 2021-02-02 20:06:55 He did?
creations-chat 2021-02-03 13:37:24 whats going on here
creations-chat 2021-02-03 13:39:25 About what,someone salty they got a lot of downvotes or somethin
creations-chat 2021-02-03 13:41:37 a'ight. also,does anyone know how to send like a stack of images at once in creations cuz i can only select one at a time-----im not gonna buy Nitro man
creations-chat 2021-02-03 13:43:48 <@!697893501274161325> U need Nitro for more <@!764906252202410005> can only select 1 (MasterFB wrong ping)
creations-chat 2021-02-03 13:48:31 Im legit considering just buying Nitro to send everything.
creations-chat 2021-02-03 14:05:26 They will all have up and downvote thing, thats gonnamake the thing a lot longer. Also i preffer just a single
creations-chat 2021-02-03 20:12:13 As said in the post, the game has no 1x5 Wedges so i couldnt make it longer. Using anything else looked weird to me so i just settled with shorter.
creations-chat 2021-02-03 20:14:44 Ye, planned to make it shorter but i wanted to show as much as i can for this huge thing, also thanks

<@511559470376026135>  thanks, i also made the gap bigger so i can actually have Planes fly in and out. Best thing people managed to land were the tiny tutorial plane
creations-chat 2021-02-03 20:16:45 I thought about it but i didnt wanna make a third fold cuz most the time i gotta wiggle around for 5 minutes till it hooks up properly. You run oit of space in these tiny plots way too fast
creations-chat 2021-02-03 20:18:53 Tried my best,mostly didnt work as intended. Too small plot and too short wedges. I couldve probably made it more detailed in shape if the wedges could be longer
creations-chat 2021-02-03 20:21:08 Looks like if a Tank-A gonk droid-and a Mouse droid had a baby.
I like it
creations-chat 2021-02-03 20:24:36 Fixed it. To be fair thats a hard name tho <:Yikes:704804144657203220>
creations-chat 2021-02-03 20:27:00 Because this thing is huge and has a lot to show. To be fair, only takes like 6 seconds to scroll up

<@730167773426090006> ,no i very much need more, this is a 8.7k Cruiser <:empty:794431705070174238>
creations-chat 2021-02-03 20:30:00 Are you legit downvoting only cuz i made a bunch of pics instead of a boring 1 or 2? Yeesh man <:Bruh:589676002221883403>

Also i doubt your sub has as many  inside details if you only posted 4 pics.
creations-chat 2021-02-03 20:33:48 U say thats more detailed and has more blocks? U prob only used normal blocks.
I used mostly Beams too and still 8.7 :no_mouth:
creations-chat 2021-02-03 20:35:54 Like 1 or 2 rooms maybe. Certainly not lookin like many tho
creations-chat 2021-02-03 20:38:09 Thats not even all, i deleted more than half of what pictures i took to only include the important rooms

Also @skulloid7#0569 agreed
creations-chat 2021-02-03 20:40:55 Fair but people really be babies if they are too lazy to scoll that up when it only takes like 6 seconds.

Also its not that good if you make a detailed build with a bunch of rooms but only show a lil of it if you ask me(not meaning ur sub)
creations-chat 2021-02-03 20:42:57 Eh, i guess thats fair.
creations-chat 2021-02-03 20:45:06 The hull would be ok if you maybe "stretch it out more" like make thw whole thing longer.

<@730167773426090006> thanks

Also geez, did they have to do the slowmode THIS slow
creations-chat 2021-02-03 20:50:01 When you make a tutorial Plane on youtube and put bombs in it as a self destruct when you start the plane <:PepeLaugh:697130830081818634>
creations-chat 2021-02-03 22:43:26 <:wait:652565313337950230>
creations-chat 2021-02-03 22:51:25 Why does it feel the mission for <#384025409945337856> is just to not get many dislikes instead of getting many likes <:thconking:535171057649188865>
creations-chat 2021-02-03 22:58:14 Actually i didnt mean "Try to get downvotes" i said "Try not to get Downvotes"

creations-chat 2021-02-10 21:17:25 <@389868705674297345> gonna have to dislike cuz that things is too big for a Tie Fighter
creations-chat 2021-02-10 21:31:17 And i never said it has to be. I just dont like things with unfitting scale

<@389868705674297345> the cockpit is more of an Tie Advanced than a Normal Tie so it throws it a bit off. Also the wings are too wide
creations-chat 2021-02-10 21:40:32 Not just 1 block
creations-chat 2021-02-22 08:44:38 <@456226577798135808> is that the Cannon from the Legend of Korra?
creations-chat 2021-02-22 08:49:33 Ok cuz it reminded me a lot of it <@456226577798135808>
creations-chat 2021-02-22 08:51:36 Yeah

creations-chat 2021-02-22 23:33:04 People in this server despise Planes. Kinda ironic
creations-chat 2021-02-22 23:35:05 Oh he was talking about the comment, nvm then.

Still ironic people hate Planes in this server
creations-chat 2021-02-22 23:37:23 I saw a lot of high quality planes in my time here, it really just looks like people dont like Planes or Jets

99eryaydude yes its not as good as some other builds but not as "trash" as most people here say

Miin_tyy show me one thats more detailed, size accurate and has drasticly less upvotes n mine

creations-chat 2021-03-05 10:36:52 <@348731819350294528> no offense but that looks nothing like a raider class corvette
creations-chat 2021-03-05 10:39:27 I attempted a raider class once, its really not that hard. And you dont have to act like that, im pointing out what it is

Like you didnt even try adding wings did you
creations-chat 2021-03-05 15:40:04 I just canceled the whole thing cuz it didnt fly well, wings were good tho

<@348731819350294528> ill send a pic once i got time to play
creations-chat 2021-03-11 09:46:29 <@!701675241084289054> you should put Donuts in Giornos Hair <:Thonk:509498568982134816>
creations-chat 2021-03-11 11:55:32 Yes but its more for the looks than... Well anything else lol
creations-chat 2021-03-11 11:57:47 I still like that you can turn it on and off tho, i guess thats cool
creations-chat 2021-03-11 20:07:50 Damn this blew up! People sure seem to be fascinated of my Experiment, seems like i really am the first person to try this <:ElonApprove:589130525315301380>
creations-chat 2021-03-11 20:10:44 Dont hate the game, hate the Players <:EYES:525319504721608705>
creations-chat 2021-03-11 20:14:09 Fun Fact, people in this server Despise Jets
creations-chat 2021-03-11 20:44:35 Probably cuz its unique, still suprised this is (as far as i know) the first of its kind

Took me a while to adjust the settings properly
creations-chat 2021-03-11 20:46:57 Compared to other creations on the same effort level, planes n jets get a loooot less positive reviews. At least from ehat ive seen
creations-chat 2021-03-11 20:49:52 Not sure if triangle wedges will make it look better or worse

<@386274857668706314> most people just use one colour on Cutters or use blue blocks around a white tower

I guess you could say mine is "a more elegant weapon"
creations-chat 2021-03-11 20:52:08 It only takes like 7 <:Mhm:551152556324159488>

creations-chat 2021-03-12 19:48:02 <@492815944666578975> is a bit smaller than an actual U Wing but looks pretty good still
creations-chat 2021-03-12 20:31:55 Not from what ive seen.
Height is good but id say it needs to be a bit longer
creations-chat 2021-03-12 20:39:53 Who

Also saying your build is bad often goes better than claiming its good without it being good.
creations-chat 2021-03-12 20:44:50 Im quite aware but id still say it could be a tad longer or the the part in front of the cockpit shorter
creations-chat 2021-03-12 20:47:35 I know i know but im talking about  Length not Full Size

Like with the character the Overall size changes but for example it doesnt only get wider or gains height
creations-chat 2021-03-12 20:59:35 <@672564630027108355>  better not bother to post Planes unless they are unique or super good looking, people here have high expectations for planes

Dude just wanted some feedback
creations-chat 2021-03-13 09:44:01 Like, youre not forced to like it or anything but there is no need to get so aggressive with it.
creations-chat 2021-03-13 09:46:51 "Remove those U G L Y A S S shaders"
"And its my opinion to think your shaders look like S H I T"
creations-chat 2021-03-13 09:52:28 Youre just being ignorant now. Using words like shit n ass isnt exactly "nice or polite" you dont HAVE to use swear words with criticism

You can just  say you dont like them in a NORMAL way
creations-chat 2021-03-13 09:55:00 Sure seems like you do since you said "i wanst being aggresive just saying stuff" so get ya head of ya ass will ya? Good god this kid cant make up his mind...
creations-chat 2021-03-13 09:58:33 Youre just making yourself look dumber by the second, first you wonder why i say you aint gotta act like a jerk, i explain, then you say you dont give a shit, now you say coolncruel basically says you cant criticize how about you start acting less like a 9 year old fortniter and actually go about the normal way, yeesh dude fr
creations-chat 2021-03-13 10:01:21 Ah yes, sorry to myself for waisting my 2m cooldowns on you now grow up<:FineTroll:626841259746656289>

creations-chat 2021-03-13 10:03:32 Ey, thats pretty gud
creations-chat 2021-03-13 11:57:48 Because i thought you may be an somewhat intellectual being and not some kid that bases their existence on insulting and childish behavior
creations-chat 2021-03-13 11:59:49 Say what ya like kid, i know how the deal is 🤷
creations-chat 2021-03-13 12:02:27 I certainly know you are mentally, thats all that matters <:PepeLaugh:697130830081818634>
creations-chat 2021-03-13 12:05:30 A child, maybe mentally is the wrong word, i dunno, yall still know what i mean tho.
creations-chat 2021-03-13 12:07:31 Why argue in DMs if i can just do it here <:wait:652565313337950230>
creations-chat 2021-03-13 12:09:33 Obama vs Apex

<@705816374462906389> dude needs like 2 hours to respond anyway so im pretty much set
creations-chat 2021-03-13 12:12:11 Im just giving feedback to the creation of his parents, thats what this channel is about right?
creations-chat 2021-03-13 12:14:19 I wonder why <:thconking:535171057649188865>

<@453015366281723905> 1.Even if hes adopted the parents still gave birth to him. I mean if you make a car and sell it its still ur creation
2.Uh,fair enough
creations-chat 2021-03-13 12:17:00 That site is too technologically advanced for me <:OkBuddy:652567204453154816>
creations-chat 2021-03-13 12:19:00 <@580095477471772698> ok thats pretty cool, ngl

Also <@659253543349387304> u can fold ships, especially ones that are shaped like urs

Loyd try side by side?
creations-chat 2021-03-13 12:21:01 <@580095477471772698> how many blocks is that anyway?

Excuse me? <:EYES:525319504721608705>
creations-chat 2021-03-13 12:23:16 How can ur pc even run that thing properly, does the whole server leave once u spawn it in or something or is that thing even moveable
creations-chat 2021-03-13 12:25:17 I have a Star wars cruiser with 8k blocks and if i fly with it people already start crashing

Loyd maybe try to remove the bridge, make folds on them and even more folds to have the bridge fold in
Ok that sounded better in my head
creations-chat 2021-03-13 12:27:18 Learnt that by experience <:Thinkje139:590548255927173201>
creations-chat 2021-03-13 12:30:11 Theres good methods to hide the motors but tbh, the more folds the more unstable it gets. But i dunno if thats the case with boats cuz i never made a boat

Btw maybe make it less wide so it doesnt seem like its too short
creations-chat 2021-03-13 12:52:44 people here have veeeeerrrry high expectations.Or just preffer original stuff cuz carriers are very common
creations-chat 2021-03-13 12:54:54 Drones are common too but its gonna get a better score if the quality is as good as the carrier's
creations-chat 2021-03-13 12:57:35 People like Original and Unique things like Scifi or VERY HIgh quality real-life builds,I for example only post my Star Wars Builds and get a lot of upvotes all the time---dude chill
creations-chat 2021-03-13 12:59:37 good grief,some people here really never heared of "LEarn from mistakes" and "Improving the more you make" -.-
creations-chat 2021-03-13 13:01:38 Yeah,unless the critisism includes insults like from the Plane-Pic dood earlier <:Thonk:509498568982134816>

creations-chat 2021-03-13 15:32:09 Then others shouldnt be complaining about it like that, i didnt bring it up 🤷
creations-chat 2021-03-13 15:37:15 Lmao, dude Manneq made a speedrun video of a lightsaber trying to prove me wrong and it just looks like a blowtorch
creations-chat 2021-03-13 15:39:19 Damn bro, someones salty. "20 Seconds" my ass lmao first talk shit about low effort and then cant nail  <:KEKW:670310537300672528>

And as a matter of fact nam, he sent me dms not the other way around
creations-chat 2021-03-13 15:41:24 Fair enough but i stopped boasting till he came around again with "Low effort 20 seconds" 🤷

Dood says his Blowtorch looks better and then blocks me calling me toxic, im not just gonna be silent about it
creations-chat 2021-03-13 15:43:25 Damn bro, 16 seconds, 4 less seconds for a just as shitty blowtorch, im impressed <:FineTroll:626841259746656289>
creations-chat 2021-03-13 15:52:06 Mannequin when he is unable to proof a point
"MAN U SO TOXIC"
"DUMBASS"
"CANT U READ"
"low effort lmao"

creations-chat 2021-03-13 17:12:27 Cry me a river, jack*ss

<@386274857668706314> ok then tell me, when did i start acting toxic? BEFORE getting insulted or AFTER?
You can answer the rest urself

Evidence?

Because you state it yet i dont see anything
creations-chat 2021-03-13 17:19:20 Also, i dont see how you have anything to say in this, youre the one who brought the saber up so dont be crying around for me flexing and teasing (ahem as defending myself) after yall spam me with "no effort"  🤷
creations-chat 2021-03-13 17:24:34 I never said its high effort - out of context yknow "placing down blocks" is still an effort so, cap

Im gonna stop now
Hey i wouldnt even have to continue if these dude would lay off my back for more than 20 seconds
creations-chat 2021-03-13 17:26:42 Ok but if they just lay off my back, ill lay off theirs

Ok ok,
creations-chat 2021-03-13 17:31:05 Actually we stopped for multiple hours and then continued soooo
creations-chat 2021-03-13 18:52:27 <@659552408904532009> larger than a x wing but looks pretty good
creations-chat 2021-03-13 19:03:22 Theres plenty of normal sized X Wings, the cylenders can just be replaced by Rocket engines :/
creations-chat 2021-03-13 20:20:40 I meant rather something like this
creations-chat 2021-03-13 21:00:10 Make the "snout" and the wings longer and itll be a size accurate x wing <:PewPew:532303441293344778>

creations-chat 2021-03-18 12:17:05 D O A B A R R E L R O L L

creations-chat 2021-03-18 12:24:22 Thats good, usually you wont have to go as high as 200 anyway
creations-chat 2021-03-19 18:06:57 <@492815944666578975> ik its suppose to be Roblox-Avatar size accurate but you should rather try to for example "downscale" the whole thing instead of changing the size of certain part

creations-chat 2021-03-23 17:29:25 Some people here have high expectations, others just straight up look at anything thats not perfect with disgust. Better keep clear of <#384025409945337856> cuz people here... Arent exactly the nicest

Also for ur first big creation its better than a lot of things ive seen
creations-chat 2021-03-23 18:17:07 For a what
creations-chat 2021-03-23 18:25:40 Its probably best if you use Just Wedges and Triangle wedges
creations-chat 2021-03-23 18:27:41 Well im more of a starfighter guy so i cant really help with tanks
creations-chat 2021-03-23 18:39:00 <@538048145112694784> no idea what da f*uck that is but i like it
creations-chat 2021-03-23 19:33:00 What is that, looks cool
OH AN INTERCEPTOR

I thought thats a tank . _.
creations-chat 2021-03-23 19:37:13 Ok so, 1.
Post it in build mode cuz its hard to see all the detailing and itll prob get u a better score
2.should probably rename it to some Bomber-Fighter Hybird so it will look unique like "TIE-Goliath" or something or just TIE-Heavy Interceptor i dunno
3.it is possible to make it properly sized, just cant detail as much then like the cockpit
(i have an Interceptor Variant if u want, u can take design ideas from it if ya like)
creations-chat 2021-03-23 19:41:39 ---
Btw how good does it fly, im curious
creations-chat 2021-03-23 19:49:22 Those cockpit ladders r pretty smart

Wdym motors as controlsurfaces
Like motors with Wing pannels to em?
creations-chat 2021-03-23 19:58:42 <@693308815239544903> flies pretty well but maybe experiment with more speed

<@260511623523991554> is that an interceptor or wot is it cuz it looks cool
creations-chat 2021-03-23 20:01:32 Yeah thats why i meant experiment

<@260511623523991554> epic,u got a clip of it flying?
creations-chat 2021-03-23 20:05:05 I just do motorlocking on top of eachother cuz of space problems.

Anyway, @CJ Vand#9704 , @TwoCanOfTuna#6327 would you 2 be interested in "exchanging engineering data"?
creations-chat 2021-03-23 20:07:13 Like, we all go on a priv server and compare our TIEs and exchange like building tips n stuff.

creations-chat 2021-04-15 08:30:05 <@492815944666578975> Cockpit is too big, wings r too short,prob wanna fix that
creations-chat 2021-04-18 14:42:47 <@504499525067472899> maybe make the wings of the Advanced a bit longer on the back side
creations-chat 2021-04-18 14:44:58 And maybe try to make a version that is less... "Thicc"
creations-chat 2021-04-18 18:40:18 Looks amazing, thats all the feedback i have
creations-chat 2021-04-18 18:44:37 <@492815944666578975> the cockpit-Bomb pod isnt really size accurate and the wings gotta be a bit longer at the back
creations-chat 2021-04-18 18:55:39 Thats the point tho right?
creations-chat 2021-04-18 19:09:59 Ah ok
creations-chat 2021-04-18 20:54:43 Thats where the problem is, its not size accurate to the Roblox Guy.  if you look at it from the cockpit glass you see its too big, for example the glass should be as large as a normal (sitting) person thats why its important to keep it 2x2 not 3x3. If you want i can send you some size comparisons
creations-chat 2021-04-18 20:59:13 Are you calling me short because im same size as him
creations-chat 2021-04-18 21:05:36 Yeah alright, but maybe try to make one

Making an accurate sized TIE is hard but not impossible
creations-chat 2021-04-18 21:08:26 The best way you can make the cockpit is 4x4 and then work your way to the wings accordingly
creations-chat 2021-04-18 21:12:09 Ill just DM you some examples

Can you enable DMs
creations-chat 2021-04-18 21:15:07 Yknow what, ill just send it here, some body examples of the cockpit, focus the size on the Cockpit Window however. Those are size accurate TIE pictures and  one of my 4x4 cockpit so you can somewhat see the proportions
creations-chat 2021-04-18 21:27:53 Thats why i said "sitting", when we sit we are basically still the same hight so that makes the seat the best way to see the size , its not really possible to make it exactly the same size but the one i sent ya is the closest to it you can get
creations-chat 2021-04-18 21:31:22 A Roblox avatar is simplified 2 Blocks high so it doesnt really add up since your cockpit is 4-5 High
creations-chat 2021-04-18 21:50:50 Yours is 3 blocks and 2 half blocks and your window is 3
Mine is 4 Blocks and my window is 2
creations-chat 2021-04-20 12:15:58 <@695324920565071877> can ya fetch a pic with higher resolution of the Star Destroyer

creations-chat 2021-04-20 21:46:15 <@541438917761826816> question,how do you make the white parts glow like that
creations-chat 2021-04-20 21:48:38 Yes but when i tried to make "only" the lights glow and not everything around it it didnt work. Either it didnt light at all or a too big part did.

Maybe its just my game or my pc, i dunno honestly

I tried everything and nothing worked
creations-chat 2021-04-20 21:51:39 Not sure if i tried spotlight yet, i tried everything else tho. Worth a shot
creations-chat 2021-04-20 21:53:45 Who asked tho

<@541438917761826816> ...now that i think about it i didnt try the half blocks yet,
creations-chat 2021-04-20 22:09:46 Ok and
creations-chat 2021-04-21 16:21:19 <@712997150589714455> this man made Salad Rose-Red instead of green <:wait:652565313337950230>
creations-chat 2021-04-23 12:12:14 <@403586243754983424> those rotors are not a very good idea in that colour.
creations-chat 2021-04-23 12:36:46 They kind of resemble a certain, bad logo that the German army used back in the day. It just really sticks out on that White Vtol

creations-chat 2021-05-01 11:40:28 I was thinking more about the engines actually
creations-chat 2021-05-01 12:15:31 Yeah but are those wedges on the engines Half Wedges or normal Wedges?

If they are half-keep em like this.
If they are full wedges then add some triangle wedges in the corners
creations-chat 2021-05-01 12:19:57 Alright then they r good like this
creations-chat 2021-05-01 13:52:04 Whats up

I can send a pic if ya want

Also Birrias if you build something from star wars i will approve :no_mouth:
creations-chat 2021-06-03 17:56:18 I balanced that with engine power, that SHOULD somewhat make up for the weight right

help 2021-06-16 17:47:29 Was there a change to how cutters work or something cuz i have some on front of my ship but whenever i impact it doesnt seem to be doing any damage
help 2021-06-16 17:47:52 Most of the time the build from the enemy even glitches inside the cutters for a few seconds
bug-reports 2021-06-16 19:11:06 Ok so
bug-reports 2021-06-16 19:11:13 I got cutters in front of my ship
bug-reports 2021-06-16 19:11:26 But when i ram someone-they get no damage at all
bug-reports 2021-06-16 19:11:32 Not even a scratch
bug-reports 2021-06-16 19:11:40 Anyone got a solution to that?
bug-reports 2021-06-16 19:12:15 Cuz my build is made specificly for ramming and this just ruins the whole thing
bug-reports 2021-06-16 19:30:58 Yes. Ive tried it with my friends on priv server(we both had pvp on because i also had guns and they did damage) and i also went on a public pvp server
bug-reports 2021-06-16 19:32:14 My ship goes 200+

bug-reports 2021-06-16 23:24:45 What if you dont have space for motor wings <:thconking:535171057649188865>
creations-chat 2021-06-17 06:44:04 If it was a space ship instead of a Jet, the wings would be acceptable
creations-chat 2021-06-17 06:46:44 I tried but the wings kept on glitching out and then getting out of control so i settled on blocky
creations-chat 2021-06-17 06:49:44 Yes i know exactly what you mean but when i did it always starts going crazy, no idea why
creations-chat 2021-06-17 06:52:26 Yeah, no clue why. Maybe laggy servers or something idk

creations-chat 2021-06-17 08:05:41 Agreed.

creations-chat 2021-06-17 08:33:39 Its a Creation.
creations-chat 2021-06-17 08:39:57 Dont be too mad about it, people always downvote

Some for actual reassons

Some because of dumb reassons

Some because they "can"
creations-chat 2021-06-17 08:42:44 Speaking of dumb- like 10 minute minecraft builds getting 10x more likes than other good build that take days just cuz "Lol its Minecraft"
creations-chat 2021-06-17 08:44:47 You can say that again.
creations-chat 2021-06-17 08:51:16 Thank you

creations-chat 2021-06-17 16:08:17 Yup. Stat zu helfen machen die leute eher witze. Und die auswahl an Emojis hilft auch nicht gerade. Die leute hier sagen gerne Skill Issue zu allem, 0 Verständnis, 0 Interesse ob jemand neu is oder nicht, ne.

creations-chat 2021-06-17 16:15:04 Personally i think its good, maybe make motorlocked control surfaces or somethinf

<@516436875494293524> Do i know you?
creations-chat 2021-06-17 16:17:37 Im not that much into Planes and Bombers, probably wanna ask someone else on that. I mostly do Space Ships

creations-chat 2021-06-17 16:28:56 Lmao imagine not knowing that Obc told me to ping him instead of making an argument because else ill get warned again

Also why not use the chance for a possible punishment
creations-chat 2021-06-17 16:30:57 Cant argue with that
bug-reports 2021-06-17 16:33:39 Asking for a friend, their engines are turning on but they dont move at all anymore since he bought gravity slider yesterday. Is that a known issue or something or is there a fix
help 2021-06-17 16:35:17 <#498473314445033472> anyone know anything?
bug-reports 2021-06-17 16:37:13 Ill ask him
bug-reports 2021-06-17 16:37:16 Thank you
creations-chat 2021-06-18 06:44:27 <@739369649971527720> people dont like seeing exposed/open control surfaces in the middle of a Wing.
Best solution would be to use motorlock and have a lot of controlsurfaces stuffed into 1 single-and have the rest of the wings be made of Wing panels

Also might wanna finish the paintjob first, thatll probably get you a higher score
creations-chat 2021-06-18 07:09:22 Its not the same, also you dont get to tell me if i can post or not. Dont like it? Skip it. Sheesh.

If it gets as many dislikes as the others ill delete it anyway
creations-chat 2021-06-18 07:11:40 No its not just a recolor. The engines are less ugly, theres the Antennas, the Cockpit glass is slightly different, the wings are slightly different but it overall has more weapons and Features like the eject seat

Also yeah, im still experimenting with paintjobs because most look ugly
creations-chat 2021-06-18 07:14:38 Thanks
creations-chat 2021-06-18 10:07:25 <@263880614036373504> maybe try to make it more round

Also whats the yellow stuff on the head
creations-chat 2021-06-18 12:46:47 Its body is like 80% made out of orbs or half orbs tho
creations-chat 2021-06-18 12:56:31 Cant argue with that. But you can make orbs like that

Just need to use wedges, Half Wedges, half blocks etc
creations-chat 2021-06-18 19:44:22 BRUH
creations-chat 2021-06-18 19:46:25 WW2 Be like:
creations-chat 2021-06-18 19:50:19 Thats not a Dogshit trailer. Thats a Default Block trailer. Tsk <:wait:652565313337950230>
creations-chat 2021-06-18 19:52:45 But trailers ARE just boxes. Except for colours there is barely anything to add except at the door or changing colour

Except interior
creations-chat 2021-06-18 19:55:04 I meant what to add extra on a NORMAL CARGO trailer and not what different trailers there are.

<@461639155911229440> fair enough.
creations-chat 2021-06-18 19:59:50 Did he say he doesnt have the functional stuff? Kinda didnt look

creations-chat 2021-06-18 20:12:39 Not getting offended is something one has to learn or get used to tho

<@392017463690133515> another glorious day in the grand army of the republic
creations-chat 2021-06-18 20:22:00 Make the engines actually visible

Unless they already are but cant see cuz of angle
creations-chat 2021-06-18 20:27:21 Maybe do a Jet engine instead

Or a Hybird of both with motorlock

Looked good on my Tie, will probably look good on your jet too
creations-chat 2021-06-18 20:29:23 I meant put Jet and Rocket in the same block
creations-chat 2021-06-18 20:32:15 Thanks, will keep in mind.

creations-chat 2021-06-18 20:34:29 <@746383586755870821>  Hard to see the difference, can you make the Jet engine same colour as rocket? Also probably wanna make that block be above the engines

creations-chat 2021-06-21 13:05:04 Feature wise its pretty good but ive heared some people say only people who r shit use it

So i wanted to hear what everyone in here thinks
creations-chat 2021-06-21 13:07:58 Ik but

Morals n stuff
creations-chat 2021-06-21 18:18:33 <@718409831639154718> sheeeeesh i dont wanna imagine how much motors that has
creations-chat 2021-06-21 18:20:35 Cool but... Can the wings even connect?

<@718409831639154718> Jesus fu? *) *(€! 3! Christ how long did that take?
creations-chat 2021-06-21 18:22:35 4 Weeks as in days or 4 weeks of Gameplay time <:Yikes:704804144657203220>
creations-chat 2021-06-21 18:25:15 Ngl for that ammount of locking and placing a Month seems like not much
creations-chat 2021-06-22 05:45:27 <@593888896719519744> a bit huge for an x wing right? Also you should try to put the engines on top/below the wings so they can actually close
creations-chat 2021-06-22 05:49:34 <@718409831639154718> sheeeeeesh congrats
creations-chat 2021-06-22 05:51:52 <@820419013011177492> make the mandibles longer then its perfect

Also Box, did you to to get in the HOF yet?
creations-chat 2021-06-22 05:54:35 I dunno, Ground vehicle haters
creations-chat 2021-06-22 06:57:11 Yes. Apparently more than you cuz the engines are above the wings so the wings can properly connect when switching between attack mode.
creations-chat 2021-06-22 06:59:23 Lmfao
creations-chat 2021-06-22 10:20:14 3 years isnt considered late right
creations-chat 2021-06-22 10:25:15 A bit big for a Speeder bike right?
Well anyway, you should try maoing one with Black Gold and Blue-Purple :eyes:
creations-chat 2021-06-22 19:53:17 Its pretty big for a speeder tho
creations-chat 2021-06-22 19:56:31 Fair point.
But you gotta admit its pretty huge-like Cannon size huge
creations-chat 2021-06-23 12:13:17 <@583044960111034388> context?
creations-chat 2021-06-24 11:21:45 <@746415450505609318>
creations-chat 2021-07-04 15:24:27 Nice but i suggest 2 things
1. Replace the green from heli pad with another colour, thatll probably look better
2.Maybe have some red rods that connect the sink thingy to the other side of the ship
creations-chat 2021-07-04 15:27:23 Something like this

<@739369649971527720> uh...i dunno make the nose shorter
creations-chat 2021-07-04 15:37:20 F
creations-chat 2021-07-04 16:32:50 Perfect
creations-chat 2021-07-04 16:35:01 Youre welcome
creations-chat 2021-07-04 16:37:03 Unfunny comment
creations-chat 2021-07-04 16:55:06 The brown is wood right? Maybe change it to a darker tone like Dark Oak
Also if you have music box then add the hydraulic sound to the sink
And maybe make the bottom part of the ship less blocky and more round. and/or give the back part of the ship behind to the smoke pipe a different shape like a half-hexagon ir something (optional)

Then theres also the heli pad, change the colour to something else
I think thats about it right now
creations-chat 2021-07-04 18:47:20 Noice
creations-chat 2021-07-04 19:09:35 Ok next up... Make the smoke thingy more like a half-rectangle, smaller and longer and the bottom red in a darker tone. Either same as the oil thingy or darker. Or Grey like the upper part
creations-chat 2021-07-04 19:12:22 A bit darker, like Crimson red
creations-chat 2021-07-04 19:23:32 Dis

bug-reports 2021-09-15 08:21:33 Anyone know anything about that?
bug-reports 2021-09-15 09:36:33 Not the issue, it also does damage on low speed just not much
bug-reports 2021-09-15 09:36:56 Also i figured it out, apparently my Landing gear-pistons somehow broke the cutters
bug-reports 2021-09-15 09:37:07 No idea why
bug-reports 2021-09-15 11:05:03 Could be
bug-reports 2021-09-15 11:05:28 But the damage only comes on some builds

bug-reports 2021-11-13 12:46:42 Weird bug i encountered

I added some conveyor engines to one of my large ships and when i use it i fly for 3 seconds- i freeze for about 5 seconds and after that

Its like all the weight is gone. When i tilt, move to the left, right etc it does it really fast. Its still controlable but its like there only the weight of the actual engines left and nothing else
bug-reports 2021-11-13 13:53:32 Whats that
bug-reports 2021-11-13 13:53:45 Is there a vid to that somewhere
creations-chat 2021-11-26 19:49:15 Thank you
creations-chat 2021-11-26 19:54:59 Thanks, took some practice to make it look decent. 2 Snow pipes on top of eachother. Bottom is a Redish Orange and the top is Whitish Yellow. I dont remember the settings but the top one has pretty much same settings as the bottom one but all cut in half
creations-chat 2021-11-26 20:09:20 I only do it ocassionally

bug-reports 2023-07-07 15:16:37 on one of my big builds the anchor doesnt let you unanchor sometimes. 

Anyone know a solution to that or whats often causing it?
bug-reports 2023-07-07 15:24:41 Almost 2 plots,little over 8k. But i never have that issue on my other big builds-some even bigger then that one.
bug-reports 2023-07-07 15:24:53 No,no, just randomly
bug-reports 2023-07-07 15:25:46 I anchor often but after around the 5th-10th time it always goes to the point where it doesnt unanchor anymore
bug-reports 2023-07-07 15:26:21 If thats the case then my other builds should also be affected tho,right?
bug-reports 2023-07-07 15:27:00 Also i checked a few times, dont have anything buggy on them like suspensions or pistons. Although i do have conveyors but thats also on all my ships
bug-reports 2023-07-07 15:27:31 All around 2 plots long, varies between 6-9k blocks
bug-reports 2023-07-07 15:28:24 ---
Oh that reminds me. I noticed theres a display issue  where the block count doesnt go down sometimes
bug-reports 2023-07-07 15:28:39 Also yeah,anchor blocks r at 998
bug-reports 2023-07-07 15:29:49 664 motors but i do have a ton of  motorlock
bug-reports 2023-07-07 15:30:11 But thats also on my other builds so it cant be that
bug-reports 2023-07-07 15:31:15 I tested around and before the last update i noticed its after i accidentally explode some explosive blocks (pvp off)
bug-reports 2023-07-07 15:31:30 But i fixed that and it still happens,just randomly now.
bug-reports 2023-07-07 15:32:30 Yeah,15
bug-reports 2023-07-07 15:32:49 Buuuut my other builds also all have motor 2s so its probably not that
bug-reports 2023-07-07 15:33:16 Yes,toggle on
bug-reports 2023-07-07 15:35:05 I also noticed it happening very specific. My ship fits inside the canyon so sometimes for fun i land in it. Every time i get to around the bottom of it, it anchors by itself and i cant move it anymore. Doesnt even budge when flipping.
bug-reports 2023-07-07 15:36:30 Uh
bug-reports 2023-07-07 15:38:12 The other guy made a suggestion about colors
bug-reports 2023-07-07 15:38:16 Disnt mean u
bug-reports 2023-07-07 15:38:34 No not really but it does use angle lock
bug-reports 2023-07-07 15:39:14 He meant me)
bug-reports 2023-07-07 15:39:43 Aaaaand i cant unanchor again,speak of the devil
bug-reports 2023-07-07 15:40:00 Dude
bug-reports 2023-07-07 15:40:12 -
bug-reports 2023-07-07 15:40:59 Ok i think the anchor bug happens when i stay anchored too long?
bug-reports 2023-07-07 15:41:56 Maybe its just lag,although the ship isnt TOO laggy
bug-reports 2023-07-07 15:42:52 Cant imagine lag making my anchor take more than a minute to unanchor tho so maybe not
bug-reports 2023-07-07 15:43:55 Very odd,very odd
bug-reports 2023-07-07 15:46:34 Ok i THINK sometimes the anchor problem comes is when i get close to terrain because i just tried to land and anchored a second before it and noe cant unanchor again
bug-reports 2023-07-07 16:00:56 Dont ping big man
