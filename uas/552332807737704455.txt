plane-crazy 2020-07-27 01:33:04 wait did they update foil's weight? i did a test like a year or so ago and foil and fabric were the same
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 01:30:21 but i need lighter
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 01:29:34 is foil better then?
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 01:28:54 i was only thinking about it being lighter
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 01:28:48 oh yeah
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 01:28:21 like can i make a wing out of half fabric blocks
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 01:27:32 like a fabric normal block has slight aerodynamics, or a fabric wing is better than a normal wing
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 01:26:56 wdym
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 01:26:38 weird stuff always happens when i switch parts of my aircrafts to fabric and im wondering; do fabric blocks have aerodynamics? or are they just broken af
