bug-reports 2022-02-08 01:32:50 Might still just be a settings issue, but since im not going to get help from other channels and ive done the stuff below, im just going to list this as a bug in case it is one:

Particles have been sparcely appearing for me the last few times ive joined ( a few months now). Sometimes they work, sometimes they dont. I have Graphics set to max, i have particles on in settings, ive tried using other combinations of those, and ive tried both public and private servers. I cant figure out why the particles aren't working
