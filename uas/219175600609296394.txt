plane-crazy 2019-09-06 14:15:14 one sec
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 14:14:45 ballasts add the most weight <>
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 14:14:19 so just adding a bunch of weight?
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 14:13:59 how so?
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 14:13:21 my submarine.. to actually work and make it dive.. required: 30 5x5 water properellors and about 100 super rockeet engines üôÇ (all facing downwards)... thats alotta boyancy
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 14:08:42 made a submarine üôÇ
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 14:04:00 fonkl üëç
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 14:00:38 especially the front
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 14:00:26 but its so freaking boyant
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 14:00:21 e.e im getting it closer to becoming a sub
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 13:51:45 or a sinking ship
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 13:51:38 Does this count as a submarine?
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 13:48:48 y?
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 13:46:46 like 6 atleast
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 13:46:43 way more than 4 months
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 13:46:37 maybe , and legend yeah its been a while
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 13:46:27 quedd idk
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 13:43:50 my ship is to boyant üò¶
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 13:43:17 
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 13:13:01 this can totally become a submarine !
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 19:29:59 <@!340543153922768906> how do friction blocks work? been told to ask u about friction blocks cus u the man with (ab)using them
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 19:27:19 how does friction blocks make creation fly??
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 19:26:55 adds friction? e.g. to slow u down or?
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 19:26:46 what does friction blocks do?
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 19:26:14 just be quiet honestly... theres no point in talking about ebola and fighting honestly.. gets us no where
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 19:25:52 guys can i say one thing?
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 19:23:05 argument forming??
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 19:23:01 lol
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 19:22:36 **when your F2P**
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 19:20:58 with its body type
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 19:20:54 it looks like a sub ish
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 19:20:29 and maybe a submarine for that rank aswell?
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 19:20:22 time for me to change my malevolence into a vtol killing machine üôÇ
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 19:17:39 simples
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 19:17:17 make the window just square then..
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 19:17:01 I see
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 19:16:32 not enough space or?
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 19:16:02 how so>?
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 19:13:36 nitro boosts only last a month i believe
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 19:13:12 to much pot
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 19:12:49 coincidence??
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 19:12:46 rip my game crashed... somehow exactly on 420 sps though
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 19:11:38 kk
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 19:10:49 a problem ive found with motors is... if blocks are connected by motors.. the anchor will anchor the main body yet the blocks connected via motors will continue moving and only with a little delay be brought back to their right positions.. but sometimes they move so much in that delay that they get stuck inside the ships body
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 19:05:42 maybe that mix just creates strangism > welp eh.. im happy
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 19:05:26 anyways if u wondering where i come from .. im south african but raised in england... maybe thats why im so strange?? because south africans like to be upright and get to the point e.g. they say things straight as they are > whilst english they just polish and try be as polite as possible and go around the subject to make it as little rude as possible
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 19:03:52 even if people hate it
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 19:03:35 idk truely where i come from ... eh ive been called special and strange but truely.. what is the point in being normal and hidden when you can just be yourself fully ?>
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 19:02:36 lol
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 19:02:09 its like snokes capital ship >> just big and flat
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 19:01:58 engines look fresh <> rest is pretty bland
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 19:01:50 i have
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 19:01:32 didnt know that existed üòã
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 19:00:58 secutor?? or executor ?
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 19:00:17 show u how? how?
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 18:59:21 what star wars ship should i do >< (not providence or lucrehulk.. providence u cant do cus base dimensions is just not tall enough for it.. lucrehulk, some people done it already and its kinda bland soz.. interior is good but exterior is oof)
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 18:57:58 ITS A TRAP
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 18:57:45 nvm its a star wars reference
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 18:57:32 nah> thats just a trap
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 18:57:14 like>?
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 18:56:56 I was thinking that but a few have done so already
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 18:56:34 C-90 ?
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 18:55:59 btw should i make a star destroyer?
or just remake my Venator?
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 18:55:35 <@456226577798135808> inside isnt that big.. its 1/4 base width
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 18:54:49 <@456226577798135808> yes... if you mean me hehe
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 18:54:26 <@!308156968550268928> freedom of speech :< soz if <> annoys you
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 18:53:45 and no >< not enough space
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 18:53:40 0.o that train mind
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 18:52:49 and theres a train inside the malevolence??
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 18:52:42 pause*
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 18:52:38 <> is just a paus Megal
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 18:52:27 train?
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 18:52:16 but I guess i can start working on it üôÇ to make it vtol
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 18:52:07 I didnt work on it to make it fly yet cus motors were buggy constantly <> so couldnt actually hold together
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 18:51:51 thanks
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 18:51:41 and yes mind
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 18:51:38 <@!340543153922768906> i would say motors are generally fixed
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 18:50:12 looks fresh idra
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 18:50:02 
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 18:49:54 rips my game still lags with this creation... 9 fps
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 18:48:49 cus <> I do?
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 18:48:16 normally would take 5 mins MINIMUM to fold my ship<> took 2 this time
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 18:47:53 they run much smoother
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 18:47:50 i would definitly say motors have improved though
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 18:43:13 my ship is all attatched... guess with motors it says nope
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 18:43:02 
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 18:42:49 turns out its worse
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 18:39:47 Test #1
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 18:38:35 let me screen record it fully and see if it actually is improved at all
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 18:38:23 welp
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 18:38:10 I am testing this right now
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 18:37:54 MOTOR FIXED??
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 18:37:29 btw does a spaceship which functions FULLY as a aircraft carrier <> allowed to get master shipwright (its 4500 blocks)... its a multi purpose vehicle
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 18:36:33 üëè
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 18:34:53 thats gonna be a thing?
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 18:34:30 hyperinventor?
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 18:34:02 Also ment to have Aeronautical master >< not engineer
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 18:33:00 VTOL engineer is ment to be VTOL master
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 18:32:37 first off.. not quite
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 18:30:38 i see they changed and added ranks >< time to get em all >?
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 18:29:28 hello
plane-crazy 2019-07-23 19:31:04 BOIS
plane-crazy 2019-07-23 19:30:32 herobrine .... thats the only possbility to why.....
plane-crazy 2019-07-23 19:26:39 sakura made a his own washplate... and had a dual rotor
plane-crazy 2019-07-23 19:25:09 <@!251202211470770176> 1ASakuraA1 is the man to go to for helicopters
plane-crazy 2019-07-23 19:24:37 i maybe doing this cus i got nothing else to do..... debates can be fun
plane-crazy 2019-07-23 19:24:10 also due to the size of spacecrafts (relating to star wars size) the effects of forces around it that would unbalance an aircraft.. which would then need to require support like wings for airplanes or... tail rotor for heli's.. but for giant spacecraft> vtol is good enough in which engines from either side of the spacecraft will fire to balance it and will be on at a constant rate>> eg> it flys in air.> aircraft
plane-crazy 2019-07-23 19:21:37 vtol<
plane-crazy 2019-07-23 19:20:56 designed for space.. hence engines work in space.. aircraft dont fly in space cus engines are made for earths atmosphere (air) .. but spacecrafts function in earths atmosphere aswell.. so spacecraft=aircraft as works in air .>> logic? or do i have autism..
plane-crazy 2019-07-23 19:19:58 lol
plane-crazy 2019-07-23 19:19:08 idk if V0xelBox will see this.. but relating to what he said in <#504718138399522832> >> an aircraft by definition is: an aeroplane, helicopter, or other machine capable of flight.
**"or other machine** capable of flight" that qualifies spacecraft >> they capable of flight in earths atmosphere.. yes they may be "made" more space... but they can function perfectly fine as an aircraft>> this means spacecraft is allowed depending on the model but most spacecraft are used in earths atmosphere to then get into space... spacecraft=aircraft >spacecraft=in space >aircraft = in air... spacecraft can fly in air>> spacecraft=aircraft üòã
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 17:02:01 got to a million in spd due to just using motors... no enginees.. no magnets.. nothing.. only motors (all connected>> still part of one build.. no excess stuff .. no objects lost.. just motors) and yeah>> it was insanely broken
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 17:01:04 except... im not using motors cus>> same object size = rip = broken = fix please
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 17:00:45 i mean the other part of the vehicle.. if u have it filled to the area.. so your folding a sized object which is the same size of the object which the motor is on
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 17:00:08 the nose can fold
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 16:59:41 i mean instead of folding>
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 16:59:12 btw > is there any way to connect to sections of a vehicle together.. without any motors or magnets?
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 16:43:05 are motors still LAGGY af?
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 16:43:01 Guys
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 16:27:32 they work but not moving two objects of equal sizee>>
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 16:26:51 motors been bugged since day one literally
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 16:26:30 and hi turbo

plane-crazy 2019-06-27 21:00:36 like ever...
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 21:00:29 erm i can take a screenshot doe>> ill show u something that shouldnt happen
