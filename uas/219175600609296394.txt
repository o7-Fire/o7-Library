creations-chat 2018-11-14 21:47:41 i made a 1k plus block plane ðŸ˜ƒ it flys... barely but it does
creations-chat 2018-11-14 21:52:20 Tealur is mid way making this awesome plan so i just had to post this
creations-chat 2018-11-14 22:11:17 ik its not
creations-chat 2018-11-14 22:11:49 im part way making this rocket launcher automated system with continous reload... but this is the base for it
creations-chat 2018-11-14 22:12:02 i gtg doe, ill continue this tomorrow
creations-chat 2018-11-14 22:22:35 <@194241218811658240> what u can do like alot of people is make a system where u make your rocket into two seperate pieces then use motors and half blocks to move and connect them together
creations-chat 2018-11-14 22:23:45 i havent seen a giant rocket yet doe... but thats what other big build creations do
creations-chat 2018-11-14 22:24:30 .... to large prob
creations-chat 2018-11-14 22:25:07 i swear it would cause some lag
creations-chat 2018-11-14 22:25:15 how many blocks was it?
creations-chat 2018-11-14 22:25:32 so not to many... prob 2k
creations-chat 2018-11-14 22:28:18 <@163143541160148992> would creating an automatic reload rocket bullet cannon, count as a unique idea???? eg is it inventor worthy
creations-chat 2018-11-14 22:28:54 oh my i just had another idea..... i can make it have two magazines!
creations-chat 2018-11-14 22:29:35 ah
creations-chat 2018-11-14 22:29:41 rips
creations-chat 2018-11-14 22:30:32 wut u could do if it was 2 wide... make a disconnector and make the magazine go into the gun upwards... so use gravity... to load the gun
creations-chat 2018-11-14 22:30:51 thats what imma try
creations-chat 2018-11-14 22:30:58 idk

creations-chat 2018-11-15 18:35:55 damn that vtol loooka sick
creations-chat 2018-11-15 18:37:56 elon musk is hard :)
creations-chat 2018-11-15 18:38:08 but its for a reason :)

creations-chat 2018-11-15 18:43:36 guys, can someone attempt to create a vtol giant star wars space ship??? (vtol cus ... they hover so it would be realistic to the movies)
creations-chat 2018-11-15 18:44:07 has it worked?
creations-chat 2018-11-15 18:44:46 has anyone made a providence dreadnaught?

creations-chat 2018-11-15 18:45:27 ik why they havent
creations-chat 2018-11-15 18:46:05 one... to big... two... unstable .... three... vertically big.... four... its just bulky and so hard to make with the space avaliable
creations-chat 2018-11-15 18:52:13 Guys... if i replicate a spaceship from a movie but its not currently in real life .. will that count as part of the replicator rank?
creations-chat 2018-11-16 20:23:43 im currently making a 16 magazine rocket defense system
creations-chat 2018-11-16 20:24:58 16 rockets in one magazine*
creations-chat 2018-11-16 20:30:33 this is anoyying
creations-chat 2018-11-16 20:30:43 with disconectors... it drops the thing aswell
creations-chat 2018-11-16 20:30:47 welp i gotta use pistons then
creations-chat 2018-11-16 20:33:42 what do anchored blocks do?
creations-chat 2018-11-16 20:34:56 but u wouldnt use it generally doe?
creations-chat 2018-11-16 20:54:13 mr missle rocket thing is a fail... mainly cus i need blocks which connect one side but do not connect to other blocks on the other side but are smooth unlike wedges
creations-chat 2018-11-16 20:58:14 there must be a new wheel system... because this never happens... when i  want it to go left... all wheels point right which makes it move right (it doesnt even make it turn) ... half of the side is suppost to be the opposite direction....
creations-chat 2018-11-16 21:06:28 dude

creations-chat 2018-12-02 16:54:56 has anyone made a escape pod which opens by the top?
bug-reports 2018-12-02 17:17:51 rickje.... do u know how to do this... robo doesnt so ;/ i dont...  do u?? basically the motors are suppost to pull this hatch open.. however i cannot fill in those holes without it connecting to something else... hence there is gaps
creations-chat 2018-12-02 17:19:23 <@163143541160148992> dude do u know the guy who built the escape pod for the consular class cruiser (from star wars)
bug-reports 2018-12-02 17:22:33 it opens fine yes
bug-reports 2018-12-02 17:22:39 but i cant put anything where the gaps are ;/
bug-reports 2018-12-02 17:23:00 cus if i did it would weld to something... but theres no blocks to replace the blocks beneath it to make it not weld so i cant do anything bout it
bug-reports 2018-12-02 17:23:10 i just made a side door instead.. its easier
bug-reports 2018-12-02 17:25:20 rickje... can u make a block that only connects together from  two points length wise... what i mean is with the block u can make a doors open which are only 1x in width...
bug-reports 2018-12-02 17:27:25 eg... i want to make this into two seperate doors so the blocks in the middle open outwars... so Block: Block which opens left (door) : block which opens right (door) : Block...... we cant currently do this as blocks dont only connect vertically but connect to atleast one horizontal block, (sideways)
bug-reports 2018-12-02 18:47:41 engines aint working... idk why.. no anchor blocks or anything which will make it not work but they not moving at all
bug-reports 2018-12-02 18:48:31 imma rejoin to see if it fixes

creations-chat 2018-12-20 18:50:17 ik a solution to overwriting saves, there should be a button to load previous server saves eg.... if u overwrite something big in a server .. u can load all your slots from previous server (so anything u added in the server u currently in will not save... so big creations wont get removed if u accidently removed it)
creations-chat 2018-12-20 19:17:39 or a third confirmation... so loads u click load and then confirm... saves.... u click save then u say confirm and then it says ARE YOU SURE YOU WANT TO SAVE?
creations-chat 2018-12-20 19:18:27 i wonder how good this game would be if it was rescripted

bug-reports 2019-01-08 21:47:04 i have to say one thing doe, motors have defo improved since with folding etc... only problem now is the lock.... it doesnt work properly... same with the piston lock
bug-reports 2019-01-08 21:47:23 both locks dont work... the motor/piston still moves when its "locked"
creations-chat 2019-01-10 18:51:23 <@256501003493441547> nice atat walker.. i think i can help make it walk better..
creations-chat 2019-01-10 18:53:16 Move the front right and back left together... then once they move forward... move the backnright and front left (eg use seperate controls.. another guy made it just have one key but he used motors and idk how to do what he did )
creations-chat 2019-01-11 20:08:18 if 2/3 of my ship flys with helium (which is like 3k blocks total for just the 2 sectors (not including the third)) is that still legable for the master engineer rank
