help 2022-08-06 16:01:05 Like the color of the afterburner?
help 2022-08-06 16:11:37 Something like the mig29 exhaust might look good with it.
help 2022-08-06 16:29:26 Use trail
help 2022-08-06 16:30:41 Set the lifetime pretty low so the trail isn't really long
help 2022-08-06 16:32:23 I guess that would work
help 2022-08-06 16:33:11 I don't think that will affect the circumference of the trail tho

help 2022-12-07 15:39:37 Phone
help 2022-12-07 15:41:27 It's a phone...
help 2022-12-07 15:47:07 Most of the buttons are for use on the ground and adjusting the angle of things before I  activate the motor lock. So like 90% of the time those buttons are irrelevant.
help 2022-12-07 15:55:20 That and I'm too lazy to delete the keybinds for some of the things that never get pressed
help 2022-12-09 20:42:07 Thoughts on this ugly sub

creations-chat 2022-12-13 16:09:00 Could I get some feedback on my potato quality post?

help 2022-12-14 03:11:41 Which direction is it facing?
help 2022-12-14 03:12:29 Ok I'd double check that when you can.
help 2022-12-14 03:14:29 If its being motorlocked I use motors
help 2022-12-14 03:14:49 If I use pistons it goes crazy
help 2022-12-14 03:17:25 True
help 2022-12-14 03:20:08 Yes
help 2022-12-14 03:24:31 Which direction is the motor
help 2022-12-14 03:25:51 Usually volume and power at the same time
help 2022-12-14 03:30:17 How fast does it currently go?
help 2022-12-14 03:31:25 Do all the hover thrusters have the same keybinds
help 2022-12-14 03:32:08 Hmm
help 2022-12-14 03:34:35 I assume the things on the sides are hover thrusters as well
help 2022-12-14 03:36:18 I see that now
help 2022-12-14 03:37:30 How much more room do you have to put stuff

help 2022-12-15 02:24:54 Nice
help 2022-12-15 02:30:46 You could get another 4 rows ar hover engines by putting gover thrusters in place of the cameras.
help 2022-12-15 02:31:00 <@990128005017927691>

creations-chat 2023-01-23 11:12:42 I'm wondering the same thing, I've got one similar but the star and the circle ain't aligned properly.
creations-chat 2023-01-23 11:40:45 They might just be strange looking lug wrenches
help 2023-02-26 19:11:12 Anyone know why it automatically levels itself?
help 2023-02-26 19:25:04 Are the motors locked?
help 2023-02-26 19:28:57 Make the motors locked and powered

help 2023-03-09 01:27:09 I honestly don't know
help 2023-03-09 01:30:13 There are some jet engines in the back for more pitch and some on the front and back for yaw, but other than that's it.
help 2023-03-09 01:30:52 Wasd to an extent, I don't use the joycon thing
help 2023-03-09 01:35:23 <@592619320421384232>
help 2023-03-09 01:36:27 My best bet is the lack of vertical stabilizer
help 2023-03-09 01:37:04 I mean I have them they just folded down
help 2023-03-09 01:37:40 It is
help 2023-03-09 01:39:24 
help 2023-03-09 01:41:08 It flies better with it but more wobble at higher speeds and can't do the spin thing as well
help 2023-03-09 04:57:34 I'm could be wrong, but I think the tnt has to be a certain setting
creations-chat 2023-03-22 22:59:27 Might be a stupid question. If the motor lock gets damaged when its disconnected does it affect the build?
help 2023-05-13 17:15:20 Elevators (in the back) control pitch (up & down) 
Aileron (front) control the roll.
creations-chat 2023-06-17 17:46:35 <@775918490146177024> are they controllable and what's the payload?
