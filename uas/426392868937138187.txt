creations-chat 2020-09-11 11:13:01 â€¢ Low effort (these include, but are not limited to: youtube tutorials, singular block builds)

creations-chat 2020-09-11 11:26:48 > <@!426392868937138187> you dont care about other people then you selfish rat
<@524324517431214100>  i care about creative opinions and i see the effort behind the build
