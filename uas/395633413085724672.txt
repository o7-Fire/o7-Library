bug-reports 2020-12-25 00:38:17 copy and pasting controls on this game seems to break my laptops copy and paste and if i keep constantly copying and pasting controls into something like a motor it has a chance to break my laptops copy and paste function until i restart it
even tried restarting rdpclip.exe (function in charge of copy and paste) and it still doesnt work
and what i mean is when i copy something like a image and paste it into lets say a google doc it would not work even if i keep constantly copying it
