creations-chat 2021-12-29 09:00:05 first, thanks for the embed, also i was considering adding more smoke, but i was more concerned about the shape and size of the exhaust, i think it doesn't fit the ship that well.
creations-chat 2021-12-29 09:02:34 the part that looks like it has been shredderbuged is not build yet. that is why there is also no color or details
