the-dump 2019-11-04 19:48:40 Jerry Seinfeld is an eldritch demon. His breakout show 'Seinfeld' is a longform black ritual disguised as situational cringe comedy. The actual movements and things on screen actually cast magic. The black magic of their performance is also manifested in the words they speak and what they write. I can't say whether this is because they're actually saying the words or because the words are an extension of an internal force of the characters.

However, with an in-house writer, the show was actually very clear about its agenda. The writers did not create a show. They put it together. They wrote a script that was the product of a couple years' jewish demon research.
