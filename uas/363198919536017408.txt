help 2018-10-21 01:53:12 Pro tip, when making a plane, make the landing gear at the back slightly lifted so that the plane gets angled, which can help take off much easier

creations-chat 2018-10-24 05:27:30 have you seen the OS2U i made?
creations-chat 2018-10-24 05:27:47 it lands fine, takes off of the water, had 3 hidden propeller engines,
creations-chat 2018-10-24 05:28:29 you know what i wants?
creations-chat 2018-10-24 05:28:41 2 other variants of the propeller engine, one triblade, and the other quad bladed
creations-chat 2018-10-24 05:29:12 no, having more propellers actually helps propel
creations-chat 2018-10-24 05:30:03 what about replicators such as myself?
creations-chat 2018-10-24 05:30:18 i would like a tri propeller for my Ju-87 and Bf-109

help 2018-10-24 15:58:31 I thought the blue was center of mass, and the peach was for the aerodynamics
help 2018-10-24 15:58:39 I guess i thought wrong
bug-reports 2018-10-25 05:07:36 I dont think mass and weight would be the same
bug-reports 2018-10-25 05:07:50 Also you set the density of ballasts not the mass
bug-reports 2018-10-25 05:08:00 The denser it is the heavier
bug-reports 2018-10-25 05:23:22 Well in real life, weight changes, mass doesnt, weight is affected by gravity
bug-reports 2018-10-25 05:23:32 Like the astronauts on the moon
bug-reports 2018-10-25 05:23:56 The reason they kept falling down is because theyâ€™re lighter, but their mass is the same, meaning their inertia is the same
creations-chat 2018-10-25 07:07:38 why did i get dragged into this
bug-reports 2018-10-25 07:08:44 propeller engines lost their sound?
