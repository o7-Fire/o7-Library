creations-chat 2022-12-06 17:41:54 i can do that gimme a sec
creations-chat 2022-12-06 17:45:09 meh. failed
creations-chat 2022-12-08 20:25:31 bruh. whats with the downvotes? it took 3 hours at least tell me what's wrong with it. reply: of course it does. so do you, but did i want to tell you that? no.
creations-chat 2022-12-08 20:31:49 ocean base 04 is not supposed to look good. its ment to be functional. also, that sandwich, probably did not take long. you got nerve by not taking a deep look at the base.
creations-chat 2022-12-08 20:35:33 guess what, i'm deleting and reposting, and getting rid of those damned upvotes and downvotes. also it is functional, the water sprinklers in the greenhouse really spray, the suspension springs really flatten out the base floor, and the lights really do light up.
creations-chat 2022-12-08 20:38:41 a sandwich can't be the best build of all time. i can place a single block, and it will get all the upvotes in the world. yall are sharing one braincell. but that plane doe, that looks good. probably took effort.
creations-chat 2022-12-08 20:41:02 but what if i make a russian nesting block. a giant block, but it opens to reveal a smaller block, and that smaller block opens to reveal an even smaller block. and that smaller block will open to reveal something lmao. (no like actually, a sign that says something lmao, god tier pun.)
creations-chat 2022-12-08 20:44:10 ok so hear me out. a ball that you can control. like you sit in a seat inside, and you use wasd keys to determine where it will go.
creations-chat 2022-12-08 21:09:35 i made a commercial for le sandwich. nothing happens for a while cuz recording was crap
