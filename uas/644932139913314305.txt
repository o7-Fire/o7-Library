creations-chat 2022-02-28 00:00:22 Nice, I think you should work more on the inside first, specifically, the raptor engine, once you've got everything on the inside to work, you can begin building the outside, it'd be really cool if you made a launchpad for it.

creations-chat 2022-02-28 13:35:51 That paint scheme looks great, motorlocked?
I think you could add some darker sections to make the ailerons more visible.
help 2022-02-28 13:37:50 Tuts aren't allowed on the server, primarily because they're unoriginal, they often have little to no detail whatsoever and are really just for new players for the purpose of learning how to build planes.
help 2022-02-28 13:38:28 Some of the hate also comes from the fact that many players who make said "tut" builds often claim them as their own original creations when it is quite the opposite in reality.
creations-chat 2022-02-28 13:38:45 holy why is there so much tnt is it a pvp plane
creations-chat 2022-02-28 13:40:57 I know about angle locks but couldn't springs work? They're a bit buggy but they can be used in non-pvp as well
God we need explodable tnt in non-pvp.
creations-chat 2022-02-28 13:43:16 I play on them since i'm too lazy to join a private server, also so I can lag others out with my 3000-5000 block builds. <:trollface:775024642104229898>
help 2022-02-28 13:57:41 lol
creations-chat 2022-02-28 13:58:37 this looks pog, but the nose could be a block shorter, make the nose 1 block shorter, make the paint on the flaps on your wings slightly darker than the grey you're using for the rest of the wings
creations-chat 2022-02-28 14:03:02 'TIS NEAR PERFECTION!
How fast does it go?
creations-chat 2022-02-28 14:06:03 Finally peace.
creations-chat 2022-02-28 14:10:54 Yeah he took that personally, annoyingly enough, Plane Crazy doesn't have a wedge with that angle, what he's looking for is a Half Wedge Down 1x1 2
I'm assuming that the wedge would be called that, in a nutshell, 25% of the front of the 1x4 wedge.
creations-chat 2022-02-28 14:17:58 There's always another option, replace the block behind the original pyramid wedge with another pyramid wedge and delete the first one, motor lock a half wedge down 1x2
creations-chat 2022-03-01 04:55:16 I think you COULD'VE added a bit more detail to the build, perhaps some shading, the front had no detail at all.
I think you should restart building as I continue typing this, try making a bigger one, you can use motorlocks to add detail to the cockpit, etc.
creations-chat 2022-03-01 04:57:23 That paint was too punchy, it just didn't look good, like someone wearing rgb gamer shoes with a black suit, except the entire helicopter just didn't really look good with that paint.
creations-chat 2022-03-01 05:05:00 Nice, I think you could make the back a bit more smooth, what plane is it?
bug-reports 2022-03-01 05:07:46 It's 4:30 or 5:30 for rickje i think
creations-chat 2022-03-01 09:58:34 Holy s someone actually made a lamba shuttle
creations-chat 2022-03-01 10:01:40 Shading, add the shield generators, that stuff, are you using gravity slider to make it fly?
creations-chat 2022-03-01 10:04:27 This dude hasn't seen star wars.
Not really an improvement lol
creations-chat 2022-03-01 10:06:41 The force awakens is crap, so is the last jedi and the rise of skywalker.
creations-chat 2022-03-01 10:09:15 I just had to say it, the movies were more crappy than the special effects in a new hope
creations-chat 2022-03-01 11:36:07 Yeah but compared to effects now, they're not the best.
creations-chat 2022-03-01 11:38:11 Yeah just make another one.
creations-chat 2022-03-01 11:50:26 **Little did he know that we both knew it wasn't his.**
creations-chat 2022-03-01 12:04:25 looks like one of those seperatist droids from star wars, just add a cannon to it.
What model is it called again? I think it could use a bit more shading for the legs.
creations-chat 2022-03-01 12:17:46 That doesn't exist, this is the default paintjob for all LAATs and LAAT/S vehicles.
creations-chat 2022-03-01 12:21:13 Making 1:1 vehicles on Plane Crazy is always a nightmare, especially because of block hitboxes.
hi boxness

creations-chat 2022-03-04 20:11:49 No, they're still being built, the biggest one being 5112 blocks, it's unfinished and the interior isn't complete.
creations-chat 2022-03-04 20:15:01 Yeah I think the colours are a bit too strong, you could try hiding the suspension n stuff, it'd be better if you did that.
creations-chat 2022-03-04 20:17:14 Perhaps, disconnectors or half wedge 2 from half blocks?
creations-chat 2022-03-04 20:20:11 To be honest, I don't know why you all are asking me for proof of my builds but ok, here's my WIP spaceship, it's my 3rd one, features 9 turrets, 2 escape pods, 2 rooms for living (WIP).
creations-chat 2022-03-04 20:23:25 I see the grey one as a huge improvement from my 2nd one(3847 blocks)

creations-chat 2022-03-14 13:57:24 I don't think an A320 would really need motorlocks, it's possible to build a good plane without motorlocks, unless you want to make the cockpit window well-detailed or some other stuff.
