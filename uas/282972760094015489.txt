creations-chat 2019-09-08 21:17:13 my very much still work in progress ocean liner
creations-chat 2019-09-08 21:17:53 if you're wondering about the deets, its PLANNED to be an 1860's steam powered sailing ship
creations-chat 2019-09-08 21:19:46 lmao
creations-chat 2019-09-08 21:19:52 not that kind of steamer
creations-chat 2019-09-08 22:18:50 wh-
creations-chat 2019-09-08 22:20:24 this isnt titanic????
creations-chat 2019-09-08 22:20:32 not meant to look anything like it in the end lol
creations-chat 2019-09-09 00:08:05 again still far from done, but definitely much more progress was made since the last update
creations-chat 2019-09-09 00:08:45 (also im going to need to start thinking of names for this ship)
creations-chat 2019-09-09 00:08:48 :>
creations-chat 2019-09-09 20:58:42 so major updates as you can see, i started working on the super structure, and although the picture doesnt show it, ive added another funnel and finished the sails
creations-chat 2019-09-09 22:39:14 ***Well, here she is.***

***At an EXACT total of 2,000 blocks, I give you the final design!***

***Unfortunately, I made her too skinny and tall and not wide enough, so she's only for looks.***

*If at all possible, I'd like to be ranked to Shipwright IV, thank you~!*

creations-chat 2019-09-12 00:15:57 *oops sorry for the dupe, forgot to add the caption with the image

remaking my 1860s steamer with a more streamline, and actually buoyant (i know, how innovative) so thats cool. its also way more bigger and already half the amount of parts at this stage
creations-chat 2019-09-12 00:16:39 smh note to self, actually add the word design when talking about the logistics

creations-chat 2019-12-21 23:25:30 **1958 Plymouth Belvedere**

*What's changed since your **58' Fury?***

- Gave it a well deserved blue coat.
- Gutted interior. (Wasn't really seen.)
- Made tail fins a tad longer.
- Added highbeams.
- Added metal contrast cylinder onto previously existing tire.
- Dimmed tail lights a bit.
- Fixed headlight eyebrows.
- Replaced V on front with text V.
- Reduced part count juristically.
- Made undercarriage and wheel wells better looking.
- Made rear windshield bigger.

*What took so long?*

This car didn't take long at all. The main reason why I changed it is because
I got tired of looking at the same old car. There were a few things that bothered me
so I just changed it all together.

*Anything else?*

Yes, actually, I want to give credit to a few people.

- YieldingAlanpero900 for the new wheel system which you will see in some photos.
- SirFryPanMan for helping me create a new maneuvering system for this car.
- pidosek for helping me plan out the new MS and keeping me motivated. :)))

*Photos*

Here they are. vvv

My issue WAS that the car would oversteer in the air, I fixed that problem easily with some wing panels. The next issue that arisen after is that now my car pitches way too much. Not too fast, but it some times starts pitching up or down depending upon the angle, I need some help fixing that.

help 2020-03-30 05:41:10 Hi there, I'm looking for someone who has an advanced understanding of mech construction and/or advanced motor construction to help me out here.

I'm fairly new to mechs and anything to do with it, so help would be greatly appreciated.

I'm in the midst of constructing *EVA Unit 01* from **Neon Genesis Evangelion**, and although it doesn't look very good I'm determined to finish this and not give up for once. 😅 

Anyways, enough talk, let's get down to business.
---

I'm struggling to create an ankle joint for this foot, but because I'm unfamiliar with the processes of building something like this I don't really know what I'm doing, if I did then I wouldn't be putting this out here.

Among that, some tips to perhaps get underway for the rest of the joints, etc.

Help would be greatly appreciated, and at anytime too. I'm in no rush to complete this.

Please DM me for any response since I don't always remember to check this channel, thank you.

creations-chat 2020-06-24 04:23:53 just so you know, upvoting yourself doesnt go towards a rank
creations-chat 2020-06-24 11:42:36 <@!626449107577471012> looks great! i haven't built a 18th century warship in quite some time, but just as some constructive criticism, perhaps try building a rounded hull? it adds a whole other depth to the build, and with your style of building would look fantastic in my opinion.

i would suggest looking at other's builds to kinda get some ideas on how that would play out. i recommend taking a look at vipEmpire's HMS Victory (search here or look for it in <#627195143040139264>)

hope this helps you in future builds! 😊
creations-chat 2020-06-24 11:43:48 (just so you know, you dont have to edit your current ship if you do end up using a curved hull. but it is something to check out if you ever build another ship from scratch 😄)
creations-chat 2020-06-24 11:45:12 (in the end though, it is your ship. just feel it out until you find something you like. it's about your enjoyment of the build. not others)

creations-chat 2020-08-31 21:18:58 because im tired of hearing someone calling someone/something gay as if to say its bad
creations-chat 2020-08-31 21:19:06 its rude and disrespectful
creations-chat 2020-08-31 21:19:25 ive lost all respect for you

creations-chat 2020-08-31 21:20:36 thats not what i said vip
creations-chat 2020-08-31 21:20:58 i said the way you made it sound felt like you were using it in a derogatory manor
creations-chat 2020-08-31 21:21:50 okay but it wasnt necessary to use it the way you did
creations-chat 2020-08-31 21:22:02 literally anything else

creations-chat 2020-08-31 21:23:17 i would still know its not okay to say it like that
creations-chat 2020-08-31 21:24:00 if you used gay derogatorily AND you were gay, it wouldnt make a difference
creations-chat 2020-08-31 21:24:15 because you're still making it sound like being gay is a bad thing
creations-chat 2020-08-31 21:24:23 regardless of your sexuality

creations-chat 2020-08-31 21:27:11 regardless what your beliefs are, if you are using gay in a sentence in reference to something being bad, it still sounds homophobic and IS homophobic
