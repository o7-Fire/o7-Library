creations-chat 2021-12-29 08:36:40 thanks for the feedback!
creations-chat 2022-01-10 12:03:29 bro its just a simple thing to fix
creations-chat 2022-01-10 12:14:53 guys could you give feedback on my mini yacht creation?
creations-chat 2022-01-10 12:23:56 ah ok, how could I do that with motorlock??
creations-chat 2022-01-10 12:26:32 I am new lol
creations-chat 2022-01-10 12:33:07 so funny that I forgot to laugh üòë
creations-chat 2022-01-10 12:36:13 I'm sorry but I didn't ask for a glass of your opinion üòë
creations-chat 2022-01-10 12:38:32 Before you start pointing fingers make sure your hands are clean.
creations-chat 2022-01-10 12:43:05 You don't even understand the context. Please keep your thoughts to yourself if they are supposed to offend others. Basic thing. I am not trying to start a fight here just using my brain. Period. üíÄ
creations-chat 2022-01-10 12:45:09 no, we were talking about the helicopter and he just sweared at me for no reason lol
creations-chat 2022-01-10 12:47:37 yes, because people are toxic and the rules say not to swear. I prefer the rules instead of toxic people. üòï
creations-chat 2022-01-10 12:49:54 yes but it still counts as an offence and it is not allowed to be directed at someone.
creations-chat 2022-01-10 12:52:28 Anyway, gonna play my game, not gonna spend my precious time wasting it on an argument that will never be solved. It's common sense cmon guys. I know you can do better, what is toxicity even for? This is an answer I'll prob never know. ü§î
creations-chat 2022-01-10 12:54:53 I didn‚Äôt realize you all were experts on my life and how I should live it. Continue while I take notes.
creations-chat 2022-01-10 12:58:21 <@&706009538897117185> Where are you at? Look at this, just being toxic and not respecting. Please take the actions you need to take, thanks.
creations-chat 2022-01-10 13:00:37 "Let‚Äôs change the subject. I‚Äôm bored.‚Äù üòë

creations-chat 2022-01-10 14:52:22 yes and I am new. I am sure this is bad compared to other creations but I am still proud and thats the good thing, thanks
creations-chat 2022-02-19 07:53:12 lol thought u were hating
creations-chat 2022-02-19 07:55:57 Guys could I get some feedback on my yacht? I posted the pics in <#384025409945337856>. I want honest feedback cos I am pretty new to this game with 5 days experience and I want to become pro like u guys. Thanks.
creations-chat 2022-02-19 07:59:41 looks very good. Maybe something could be more detail. The black part (where the stages separate) I think should not be just a stripe but its up to you.
creations-chat 2022-02-19 08:01:45 yeah, I havent finished the interior yet but thanks for the helpful feedback
creations-chat 2022-04-03 04:26:57 guys how's my yacht. I posted my build in <#384025409945337856>
creations-chat 2022-04-03 07:26:09 yeah i used also the navetta 30 for inspiration
creations-chat 2022-04-03 07:57:33 ok thanks for the feedback!
creations-chat 2022-07-17 15:23:06 Guys i just started building a yacht today (its custom but also based of the Benetti FB284 but as I said its custom so some parts are different) and I would like some feedback and suggestions so I can make this the best possible. Also the back of the yacht will look VERY different than what it is now. Thanks.
creations-chat 2022-07-17 15:27:33 also do not mind pinging me for feedback and suggestions. I also forgot to say that in the hull, there will be 2 floors not 1 as it is now.
creations-chat 2022-08-07 14:22:54 guys how to make chandelier
creations-chat 2022-08-07 14:24:57 nah dude like the chandelier as in lights
creations-chat 2022-08-17 16:50:54 A yacht I am building that is highly based off the Benetti FB284 but has some slight modifications like length and bow but a fully custom interior. Here are some pics. **(Work in progress)**
creations-chat 2022-08-17 16:52:58 what do you think of it?
creations-chat 2022-08-17 16:55:48 guys what do you think of my yacht so far?
creations-chat 2022-08-17 16:59:15 huh
creations-chat 2022-09-05 12:30:15 yacht size difference. the biggest yacht is mine and it's still work in progress

creations-chat 2022-09-05 13:22:36 because i was somehow floating and then i became a dwarf by trying to ragdoll <:4Weird:709084058721714324>
creations-chat 2022-09-05 13:33:06 how is fa18 canopy? i tried using some angle lock since im new to it
creations-chat 2022-09-05 13:36:18 i havent decided yet but maybe dual seater and i know that i'll need to make it longer
creations-chat 2022-09-05 14:08:56 I am not copying anyone and I can tell you many people have a similar canopy design to urs without knowing of course
creations-chat 2022-09-05 14:11:09 I do not copy because I know the feeling when someone copies you and it‚Äôs frustrating  and when I want to, I make sure to ask
creations-chat 2022-09-05 14:13:11 Dude what did I just tell you. Plus my canopy isn‚Äôt even done yet so how can you even judge. Also I don‚Äôt want to argue for stupid stuff like this just understand that my canopy might look similar but isn‚Äôt a copy
creations-chat 2022-09-05 14:17:40 Dude I know I might have a similar canopy to you but it doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs the same and you can‚Äôt accuse me because it‚Äôs not even totally the same and it‚Äôs not even finished (that means it might be even changed drastically). It‚Äôs just stupid to keep accusing me at this point when I told you multiple times.
creations-chat 2022-09-05 14:20:30 Ok it might be bad looking for you but for me it honestly looks fine plus I‚Äôm new to angle lock and I‚Äôm proud of what I‚Äôve done
creations-chat 2022-09-05 14:26:22 My guy why you being aggressive all of a sudden for no reason lol I can just angle lock or whatever I‚Äôll find a solution to it
creations-chat 2022-09-07 08:35:15 how's the 3rd floor of my yacht? I am currently working on the lights so some parts are dark for the moment
creations-chat 2022-09-07 08:46:19 Thanks
creations-chat 2022-09-07 08:49:43 this is the outside view (yacht is about 80% done so some parts are not done like the uncoloured helium blocks on the back) oh yeah and this was highly inspired by the Benetti FB284 but it has a fully custom interior and some exterior changes
creations-chat 2022-09-07 08:51:51 the sheer size of this though....
creations-chat 2022-09-07 08:57:51 of course it has and angle lock as well in some parts. this is just the back and a lot of it is in the interior as well like the circular seating area (i send screenshot of that before scroll up if you want)
creations-chat 2022-09-07 09:00:03 Yes lol I just wanted to show how I broke my brain trying to do this
creations-chat 2022-09-07 09:03:36 I really like how the bar came out though (the pool table kinda blocking the view but you can still see most of it)
creations-chat 2022-09-08 14:47:31 guys how's the sauna in my super yacht? I just made it and would like some feedback
creations-chat 2022-09-08 14:49:46 oo that might be a nice idea. maybe like a subtle steam with a smoke pipe?
creations-chat 2022-09-08 14:51:55 ok then thanks for idea
creations-chat 2022-09-08 14:57:09 me rn chilling with popcorn seeing how this scene unfolds

creations-chat 2022-09-08 15:23:21 is it now better with steam?
creations-chat 2022-09-08 15:26:08 but it think white is too bright, is it still ok if i make it light gray?

creations-chat 2022-09-08 15:46:46 HALLELUYAH
creations-chat 2022-09-08 15:48:49 glxct really doesn't have time to do something productive but instead he argues.... (i do not want to get involved in this i'm just saying....)
creations-chat 2022-09-08 15:50:53 this server deserves the medal for the most childish and toxic people (it isn't something to be proud about kids)
creations-chat 2022-09-08 15:55:47 
creations-chat 2022-09-09 11:44:25 hows my yacht guys (not done yet)
creations-chat 2022-09-09 11:49:14 No as it‚Äôs highly based off the Benetti FB284 but it‚Äôs extended and the bow is different from the real one <@725269236125138965>
creations-chat 2022-09-09 13:25:29 Thanks
creations-chat 2022-11-06 21:34:31 what do you think of the new lounge area on my super yacht?
creations-chat 2022-11-06 21:36:51 which one? you mean the trail on the coffee table?
creations-chat 2022-11-06 21:40:19 yep thats what its meant to be lol. this is another lounge area on another floor btw
creations-chat 2022-11-07 06:02:40 I‚Äôll take that as a compliment
