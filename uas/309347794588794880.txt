creations-chat 2020-09-16 12:17:54 Honestly tho shredder bugs are good in **some cases** like i transformed it to a very simple to maneuver fighter by replacing cutters with guns.
creations-chat 2020-09-16 12:18:51 honestly good for me considering im crap at plane building lol
creations-chat 2020-09-16 12:19:31 i do have a bunch of mouse aimed tanks
creations-chat 2020-09-16 12:21:17 <@!573840026601783298> Nice, but you should make the hole on the runway openable and close-able since landing on it is a big no no.
creations-chat 2020-09-16 12:26:45 I mean, the runway is a very important part of an carrier.
creations-chat 2020-09-16 12:27:04 If the runway is bad then the plane will be unable to land breaking the point of a carrier.
creations-chat 2020-09-16 12:29:11 anyway i am starting out to make some naval stuff, how i can i make it turn? Do i put a rudder on bottom with a bunch of motors to move it left and right and call it a day?
creations-chat 2020-09-16 12:34:09 I mean, considering its ** P L A N E C R A Z Y ** you can make an super cannon on a top of a carrier.
creations-chat 2020-09-16 12:35:18 because
creations-chat 2020-09-16 12:35:21 discord reactions

creations-chat 2020-09-16 12:48:57 motor2 is literally motor1 but mouse steered
creations-chat 2020-09-16 12:56:16 
creations-chat 2020-09-16 12:57:15 i put the block because
creations-chat 2020-09-16 12:57:27 if i aim the gun down too much
creations-chat 2020-09-16 12:57:32 the gun literally attaches to the roof
creations-chat 2020-09-16 12:57:40 and i cant move it
creations-chat 2020-09-16 12:59:23 a small update: made the rudder bigger for easier maneuvers

creations-chat 2020-09-18 09:48:58 should i make a next land vehicle or a submarine?
creations-chat 2020-09-18 09:52:38 do rockets work underwater or do i have to make my own torpedo thing?
creations-chat 2020-09-18 09:56:32 how i can make it go up and down? i tried using hovers but it seems its too heavy
creations-chat 2020-09-18 10:03:43 Guess i am giving up on this submarine, it acts more as a chopper than a submarine.
creations-chat 2020-09-18 10:04:32 any thoughts on this ?

creations-chat 2020-09-18 17:11:29 <@!640453989200035840> yeah based it on that but the planes are custom

creations-chat 2020-09-21 15:39:32 <@!496063580341534732> i live in a free country and have the right to decline your offer of learning how to shape 😎
creations-chat 2020-09-21 15:44:35 mine can sadly do only 200 when in a straight line
creations-chat 2020-09-21 15:50:47 would this thing work good as a bomber interceptor if i removed the propeller and put some rocket engines inside?
creations-chat 2020-09-21 15:50:52 
creations-chat 2020-09-21 15:51:25 read my message <@!163143541160148992> above
creations-chat 2020-09-21 15:52:35 with bomber interceptor i meant simply interceptor but my brain shutted down for a moment
creations-chat 2020-09-21 15:55:34 <@!353348764280422402> i removed the propeller, added an internal rocket engine and this thing can reach way higher speeds while still being very maneuvrable
creations-chat 2020-09-21 15:56:39 cheap solution but works
creations-chat 2020-09-21 15:57:24 it can reach 360 instead of solid 200 <@!353348764280422402>
creations-chat 2020-09-21 15:59:48 i just made it reach 537 while being very maneuvrable <@!353348764280422402>
creations-chat 2020-09-21 16:01:23 gotta test if its gonna go good with this armament
creations-chat 2020-09-21 16:02:23 ?
creations-chat 2020-09-21 16:02:49 ah, i had a bit of trouble with lava <@!581846949901369365>

creations-chat 2020-09-21 18:20:40 the ho is a flying wing right?
creations-chat 2020-09-21 18:21:21 you should try to make the ho 229, its a pretty interesting design compared to 264
creations-chat 2020-09-21 18:29:14 bmp 2?
creations-chat 2020-09-21 18:29:44 is it custom?

creations-chat 2020-09-21 18:48:10 i can make planes that look like bricks and maneuver like a dream
creations-chat 2020-09-22 12:02:19 a ship im working on, ignore the small white block to the side, i used it to get on the ship when building
creations-chat 2020-09-22 12:03:20 cant use too much of them or the ship will get un-balanced
creations-chat 2020-09-22 12:03:23 but ill try
creations-chat 2020-09-22 12:14:05 i am using ballasts
creations-chat 2020-09-22 12:36:53 finished pretty much anything except weapons, using rockets instead of rudder because it needs a powerful force to turn

creations-chat 2020-09-23 13:39:23 the prop could go stable 200 and go to 180 when going up
