creations-chat 2021-10-25 00:32:55 Just noticed my Czech HE-162 got bombarded with dislikes. How do I fix it, then?
creations-chat 2021-10-25 00:35:41 Aw. I quite like it's size. It makes it cute.

creations-chat 2021-10-28 23:54:29 go dislike it :v
creations-chat 2021-10-28 23:56:49 how's the f-22?
creations-chat 2021-10-29 00:04:16 wait, why don't people like my f-22?
creations-chat 2021-10-29 00:08:52 yea i guess, but cheese grater wings aren't that bad (you just gotta get used to them), and i prefer practicality over looks.
creations-chat 2021-10-29 00:11:15 and people liked that crappy bf-109
creations-chat 2021-10-29 00:14:05 search up "a5m4" in the search tab, look at the build right above it.
creations-chat 2021-10-30 15:42:38 why does everybody hate cheese-graters? it's not that bad.
creations-chat 2021-10-30 15:50:02 performance'>looks
creations-chat 2021-10-30 16:02:53 i didn't say it didn't have to look SOMEWHAT good...
creations-chat 2021-10-30 16:05:28 Something like this. Powerful, but still looks quite nice.
It still looks like an F-22.
creations-chat 2021-10-30 16:08:49 No.
creations-chat 2021-10-30 16:12:27 It helps out a bit. Remember, I prefer performance. I've been playing for a year and a half, I know what I'm doing.
Plus, there IS a motor that moves it up and down.
creations-chat 2021-10-30 17:04:20 You just need to get used to it.
creations-chat 2021-10-30 17:35:30 Then cover it with disconnectors. Not that hard.
creations-chat 2021-10-30 17:41:04 Because I'm not that bothered by it.
creations-chat 2021-10-30 17:44:50 What rubbish.

creations-chat 2021-11-13 18:24:17 Better il-76 nose?
creations-chat 2021-11-13 21:21:52 <@!809631670096887838> your builds are a crime against not just humanity, but all species on earth.
creations-chat 2021-11-13 21:56:16 how's it so far?
creations-chat 2021-11-13 22:20:32 the texts. the bloody texts.
creations-chat 2021-11-13 22:22:34 screwdriver on top of materials, push, period, make small, fixed.
creations-chat 2021-11-13 22:27:36 <@!653059099533115423> overall, it's a good jet. the parts i dislike are the nose tip and tail section. the tail has exposed motors (for a plane without slanted tails, that's a bit bad..) and the nose.. eh... looks a bit blocky. other than those, perfect jet. oh, also, use TEXTS instead of SIGNS.
creations-chat 2021-11-13 22:29:47 i like motorlock, i just think there's a point where you overly-motorlocked a build.
creations-chat 2021-11-14 17:27:57 how's the il-76 in <#384025409945337856>?
creations-chat 2021-11-15 02:09:04 What do you expect? It was a really early build of mine.

creations-chat 2021-12-01 12:53:32 yes.
creations-chat 2021-12-07 00:51:47 that took me twenty minutes to make man ü§¨ ü§¨ ü§¨ <@456226577798135808> I could do most of that, but I'm a bit confused on the proportion area. What area is specifically out of place?
creations-chat 2021-12-07 00:55:24 So basically, make the wings smaller, and make the body a bit larger. I could do that!
creations-chat 2021-12-07 01:06:39 <@456226577798135808> I'm going to be working on the wings. As you can see, I'm getting rid of one of the two side delta wings. After this, I'll re-build the wing ( <@!527127714004467723> gotta **cope**, i'm going to have to use that same delta wing design) And after this, I'll make the paint darker. How's that for a change?
creations-chat 2021-12-07 01:24:25 im sorry to say, but it won't work, turns out, that piece of wing was important, so that the wing, when folding, wouldn't collide with the fuselage. it just won't work. for now, i'll do the easier stuff. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
creations-chat 2021-12-11 18:18:28 <@!719168864705052802> <@!527653676022628353> i ran out of ideas ._. Should it just be the normal Hunter camo?
creations-chat 2021-12-11 22:00:11 I was aiming for an earth-like livery. Looking back, yea it's trash. <@!869705324314120312> Sure, I'm going to fix it up now.
creations-chat 2021-12-11 22:34:32 m <@!690727914521493504> a380
creations-chat 2021-12-11 22:37:21 not the build, but you should make an a380
creations-chat 2021-12-11 22:41:34 That's because it is. it's a Hawker Hunter. <@!690727914521493504> ook
creations-chat 2021-12-11 22:43:48 it looks quite cool. i like it.
creations-chat 2021-12-12 15:35:44 doesn't bother me ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
creations-chat 2021-12-12 15:39:18 No, seriously. It really doesn't bother me. Plus, the build is already a locked mess.
creations-chat 2021-12-12 15:43:33 aight pisshead how's this?
creations-chat 2021-12-12 15:46:14 Know what, you actually had a point. It looks better. Sorry if I was a bit egoistic.
creations-chat 2021-12-14 21:40:22 Those creations look GREAT, for being made just by a few normal people.
creations-chat 2021-12-14 21:56:37 i need feedback on my red plane
creations-chat 2021-12-15 00:48:06 Oh, no. The plane wasn't MEANT to be realistic. It's supposed to be based off a different game. Here's the link: https://www.roblox.com/games/174238106/RED-VS-BLUE-PLANE-WARS
creations-chat 2021-12-15 21:33:13 Look man, it gets boring playing the same game for two years. You gotta spice it up somehow.
creations-chat 2021-12-17 16:19:29 your sense of funny dont exist
creations-chat 2021-12-17 16:22:01 Dude, OBVIOUSLY it's a 737. It's a joke. <@456226577798135808> It's meant to be a 737-200, with the notorious thin engines.
creations-chat 2021-12-17 16:24:32 guys, calm down. yes, give feedback, but don't have a mental breakdown just because of 10 letters.
creations-chat 2021-12-17 16:27:34 I get that. I should probably fix that.
creations-chat 2021-12-18 16:07:39 God bloody damnit...
creations-chat 2021-12-18 19:42:09 That was the OLDER version, not the NEWER version.

creations-chat 2021-12-18 21:09:05 how do i like
make my builds less bad
creations-chat 2021-12-18 21:12:54 but i've already been doing that
for **two years**
creations-chat 2021-12-18 21:16:19 ok whoever responded, i have this plane. i get the cheese graters, and i will get to that, but is there anything else i can do? this is basically the basis for all my planes, so any feedback here will go to the rest of my jets.
creations-chat 2021-12-19 00:17:23 Alright. Here's the back.
creations-chat 2021-12-19 00:34:06 How's this for a change?
creations-chat 2021-12-19 00:38:37 Damn, you guys are pretty critical. Sure, I can fix up the wing shape.
creations-chat 2021-12-19 00:52:07 Is this good enough? <@!707133341454958604> <@!375281006091173890> <@!757760986848559256>
creations-chat 2021-12-19 00:56:09 half a block is all it'll go. it's annoying, but there's so much stuff in the way it can't go any further.

the-dump 2022-02-26 21:29:53 and people actually took me seriously.

the-dump 2022-02-26 21:38:51 i just realized
the-dump 2022-02-26 21:38:56 we have so much in common
the-dump 2022-02-26 21:40:59 we both have basically the same "favoirutes"
the-dump 2022-02-26 21:41:13 we both have that pizza launcher thing
the-dump 2022-02-26 21:41:22 pretty cool
the-dump 2022-02-26 21:41:43 same.
the-dump 2022-02-26 21:41:52 it was for that funny pizza event.
the-dump 2022-02-26 21:42:38 you seem to really like destroying cars.
the-dump 2022-02-26 21:43:28 i remember when i was playing plane crazy in april 2020, i would just crash my three tutorial planes into those funny-looking blades.
the-dump 2022-02-26 21:44:33 **i wonder why...**
the-dump 2022-02-26 21:45:30 i found a channel that was made by a 7-year old
the-dump 2022-02-26 21:45:51 that was adamant that shredder bugs were "just another type of build"
the-dump 2022-02-26 21:45:54 i'll get a link.
the-dump 2022-02-26 21:46:33 this little rat https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXgpp08DCtdKslBg-jfzQ-g
the-dump 2022-02-26 21:46:54 the trailer shows you everything you need to know.
the-dump 2022-02-26 21:47:51 found him out in the gjsolo server.
the-dump 2022-02-26 21:48:11 it shows everything wrong with this community.
the-dump 2022-02-26 21:48:21 toxic children, shredder bug users...
the-dump 2022-02-26 21:48:51 i could do better.
the-dump 2022-02-26 21:48:54 you could do better.
the-dump 2022-02-26 21:49:25 <@456226577798135808> could do better
the-dump 2022-02-26 21:50:46 why didn't you tell me earlier???
the-dump 2022-02-26 21:51:01 uhm
the-dump 2022-02-26 21:51:02 ismael
the-dump 2022-02-26 21:51:13 that's 130%
the-dump 2022-02-26 21:51:26 there.
the-dump 2022-02-26 21:51:34 i saw you edit that, ismael.
the-dump 2022-02-26 21:52:16 good idea.
the-dump 2022-02-26 22:24:17 aand he's dead
the-dump 2022-02-26 22:34:53 10.
the-dump 2022-02-27 02:40:55 wrong thing
creations-chat 2022-02-27 15:54:51 it's passable, but could use some much needed help.

-wings don't need to be one block wide
-fix some parts where it's really blocky
-finally, maybe a less plain colour scheme.
creations-chat 2022-02-27 15:57:03 yea, those are some pieces of advice i think are easy to implement. most people in the feedback section don't really think about how easy it is to implement something onto your plane llol
creations-chat 2022-02-27 16:03:36 Because standards are through the celling.
If you didn't spend 39583958 to the 3rd power of hours on your build, it gets disliked.
creations-chat 2022-02-27 16:06:49 I remember spending so hard on my f-15 just for it to get disliked because the wings were a little too close to the engine, and the paint scheme wasn't that good. It's really hard to get something liked.
creations-chat 2022-02-27 16:09:04 so just make something that doesn't actually exist

amazing information

the-dump 2022-03-04 22:02:01 really, really funny.
the-dump 2022-03-04 22:04:54 beautiful meme. just perfect. the comedy is spot-on.
the-dump 2022-03-04 22:07:55 last meme, but this is the best thing ever. can't argue unless you're racist.
the-dump 2022-03-04 22:08:45 <@456226577798135808> yo this guy racist, can we get him ip banned?
the-dump 2022-03-04 22:10:11 if it isn't this then it sucks. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y15DLHaZ5tA
the-dump 2022-03-04 22:10:43 <@456226577798135808> this guy too, he might also be racist.

the-dump 2022-03-05 17:00:55 we're screwed
the-dump 2022-03-05 17:01:31 pretty easy bug
creations-chat 2022-03-05 19:16:06 <@!389516889501728779> stop changing your f-18 gj, you got it right the first time. now it's **bad.** as in, less good.
creations-chat 2022-03-05 19:18:13 gj, **it looks like a dead goose.**
creations-chat 2022-03-05 19:20:38 there's just something wrong with the spine.
creations-chat 2022-03-05 19:23:02 oh i see it now.
creations-chat 2022-03-05 19:31:04 i do say, it's very hard to make a pvp plane look good. i always want a balance between good and agile, and i end up with an iron-deficient mig-29 that looks like it came from sudan.
creations-chat 2022-03-05 19:33:18 you got me there, gj...
creations-chat 2022-03-05 19:35:53 sure.

the-dump 2022-03-06 14:49:46 we're gonna have to call our isp to come and fix our internet.
the-dump 2022-03-06 14:50:22 youtube doesn't even work for me.

the-dump 2022-03-06 19:25:45 who's joe mama?
the-dump 2022-03-06 20:41:22 see, the joke here is that 9+10 is 19, not 21. the emoji and teacher in the second slide is also distorted, for comedic effect. thus, this is funny. i totally don't want to tie a noose and kill myself.
the-dump 2022-03-06 20:42:03 19.
the-dump 2022-03-06 20:42:31 **__*BAHAHAHA XDXDXDXDXDXDXD KILL ME LMAO*__**
the-dump 2022-03-06 23:07:12 lmao
the-dump 2022-03-06 23:07:18 i got a really stupid warn
the-dump 2022-03-06 23:07:26 for "putting a personal face on an ad"
the-dump 2022-03-06 23:09:03 alright
the-dump 2022-03-06 23:09:14 gimmie a sec
the-dump 2022-03-06 23:09:52 here's the warn
the-dump 2022-03-06 23:10:05 now let me get the ad
the-dump 2022-03-06 23:11:23 goddamnit i deleted the ad
the-dump 2022-03-06 23:11:28 let me make a recreation
the-dump 2022-03-06 23:18:45 this is the oh, so bad ad that got me warned for "personal images on roblox"
the-dump 2022-03-06 23:18:54 this.
the-dump 2022-03-06 23:19:08 **where is the irl face??**
the-dump 2022-03-06 23:19:53 i'm going to assume the angry mob is where they thought the personal photo came in.
the-dump 2022-03-06 23:20:51 roblox seriously needs to fix moderation. i know everybody and their grandmother have said this, but at this point it's getting ridiculous.
the-dump 2022-03-06 23:20:58 actually, it's always been like that.
the-dump 2022-03-06 23:22:31 this is just a warn. i feel bad for the people who've gotten accounts banned for silly reasons.
the-dump 2022-03-06 23:22:43 that looks scary.
the-dump 2022-03-06 23:24:24 what's next??
the-dump 2022-03-06 23:24:40 **yes.**
the-dump 2022-03-06 23:24:43 yes it is.
the-dump 2022-03-06 23:25:10 #necromancersuperiortooverlord
the-dump 2022-03-06 23:26:10 screw it, one week ban.
the-dump 2022-03-06 23:26:30 somebody should make the necromancer in plane crazy. it'd be a sight to see.
the-dump 2022-03-06 23:26:38 that idea.
the-dump 2022-03-06 23:28:14 not too long.
the-dump 2022-03-06 23:30:29 i remember this one video of somebody roasting all the tanks.
the-dump 2022-03-06 23:30:34 it was so amazing.
the-dump 2022-03-06 23:31:24 ok
the-dump 2022-03-06 23:31:58 i distinctly remember the roast for the overlord.
the-dump 2022-03-06 23:32:31 you could use it as a roast for shredder bugs too, they're so similar.
the-dump 2022-03-06 23:33:48 mfing internet taking 12 years to work
the-dump 2022-03-06 23:35:33 idk screw it, just search up "diep.io what your tank says about you" and you should find it.
the-dump 2022-03-06 23:36:51 screw you
the-dump 2022-03-06 23:37:04 overlords everywhere
the-dump 2022-03-06 23:37:50 mhm
the-dump 2022-03-06 23:38:19 i'd suggest, to find the base blue colour, just screenshot the game and put it in the hex thingy.
the-dump 2022-03-06 23:40:02 good enough
the-dump 2022-03-06 23:40:20 i should make the auto-smasher, for the memes.
the-dump 2022-03-06 23:53:06 it's coming
the-dump 2022-03-06 23:53:18 kill it before it becomes level 15
the-dump 2022-03-06 23:53:47 let's make it an auto gunner
the-dump 2022-03-06 23:53:53 so it should be a twin next
the-dump 2022-03-06 23:54:33 twin-gunner-auto-gunner
the-dump 2022-03-06 23:54:38 i memorized it
the-dump 2022-03-06 23:55:46 hm
the-dump 2022-03-06 23:56:13 ah, i see.
the-dump 2022-03-06 23:56:41 thanks for that.
the-dump 2022-03-06 23:57:59 diep.io
the-dump 2022-03-06 23:58:27 mhm
the-dump 2022-03-06 23:58:45 missing is making the autogunner
the-dump 2022-03-06 23:59:10 i'll make the autosmasher when i get on my pc
the-dump 2022-03-06 23:59:37 maybe 20-30.
the-dump 2022-03-06 23:59:54 that's what missing is making, the auto gunner.
the-dump 2022-03-07 00:00:19 don't worry, you can go flank-auto-three-auto-gunner
the-dump 2022-03-07 00:00:39 so yea, go for twin.
the-dump 2022-03-07 00:00:54 or flank, or whatever, everything except sniper works.
the-dump 2022-03-07 00:01:27 agreed
the-dump 2022-03-07 00:02:19 i guess.
the-dump 2022-03-07 00:12:45 gunner
the-dump 2022-03-07 00:12:49 then gunner trapper
the-dump 2022-03-07 00:13:02 gunner tanks are always pretty good
the-dump 2022-03-07 00:26:44 looks pretty decent, but for the barrels, maybe separate them with block 0.9s for that small little gap.
the-dump 2022-03-07 00:27:12 oh, i see now.
the-dump 2022-03-07 00:27:19 yea, i'd say it looks good.
the-dump 2022-03-07 00:32:46 how sad.
the-dump 2022-03-07 00:32:52 maybe change the keybinds.
the-dump 2022-03-07 00:38:01 that looks quite nice! all you gotta do now is add a motor 2 gun on top, maybe add some pvp weapons and you're good!
the-dump 2022-03-07 00:38:29 also, can i see it's side view?
the-dump 2022-03-07 00:39:29 rip
the-dump 2022-03-07 00:43:05 **NO**
the-dump 2022-03-07 00:43:11 **I DO THE AUTO SMASHER**
the-dump 2022-03-07 00:44:23 that's the funny thing
the-dump 2022-03-07 00:51:19 eugh
the-dump 2022-03-07 00:52:47 it's amazing
the-dump 2022-03-07 01:04:12 better hurry up, because the world is going to end soon!
the-dump 2022-03-07 01:09:57 replace "that game" with "you" and that's my response.
the-dump 2022-03-07 01:11:18 if you do not like diep.io, you are subhuman and are not entitled to the rights that us **normal** beings have.
the-dump 2022-03-07 01:11:38 alright, you're normal.
the-dump 2022-03-07 01:11:46 could've told me before.

creations-chat 2022-03-10 00:00:27 let me give my two cents that nobody asked for:

you can give criticism, as long as it isn't completely unreachable.

as a builder, take criticism you can use.

and don't be a brat either. (you could've told me that when i first joined the pcc llol)
creations-chat 2022-03-10 01:23:12 nice green "L"
creations-chat 2022-03-10 01:29:36 aw don't worry, i asked.

creations-chat 2022-03-13 21:08:06 <@456226577798135808> your plane is decent, but could use some smoothing out and a better paint job.
the-dump 2022-03-13 21:29:15 hey, look at this. the joke is, they ysed the number 6969. also, the character looks silly. that's why this ad is funny. **kill me.**

creations-chat 2022-04-12 22:07:39 this isnt a coincidence
creations-chat 2022-04-13 00:23:26 <@698587744842022983> your f-104 is ok. there are many problems with it, though. for me, it seems as if the smaller scale doomed the plane from the start. i don't really like the nose, and the exposed motors everywhere is strange. you could re-make it if you want a better scale. for the livery, i'd suggest either a german, starfighter aerospace, and the italian. just my thoughts.

creations-chat 2022-05-13 23:24:16 ah, makes sense.

creations-chat 2022-05-13 23:38:15 goddamn, that was a bit of an overreaction, wasnt it?
creations-chat 2022-05-13 23:40:13 oh no man <#504436696021204992> so toxic rn ü§ß
creations-chat 2022-05-14 00:06:51 i just asked for feedback, not positive nor negative. ¬Ø \_ („ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

creations-chat 2022-05-14 13:25:00 man i hate it when i ask for feedback on <#384025409945337856> but get none...
creations-chat 2022-05-14 13:29:11 kinda infuriating.

if you don't like a build, there's at least one thing you can say to make it less bad.
creations-chat 2022-05-14 13:36:56 there we go, some actual feedback! sure, i'll try to implement those, starting with the motor on the wings. ill try finding a better shape for the nose, possibly by angle lock.

i do say though, the spine doesnt really seem to angle much downwards, looking at blueprints.
creations-chat 2022-05-14 13:38:43 well, obviously not **all** of them. i only need 5-6 messages to get the jist.
creations-chat 2022-05-14 13:42:18 i remember one mfer came up and said "*saying build for pvp lazy excus for bad build ü§ß*" like bro are you gonna give feedback or **not?** üóø
creations-chat 2022-05-14 13:44:27 believe he also ranted about me expecting positive feedback, like dude, i only asked for **feedback,** not positive nor negative.

whatever, it's prolly just normal here in <#504436696021204992>
creations-chat 2022-05-14 13:51:30 i hope i will.

<@438388553442131988> yk need to understand that plane crazy is really hostile to new players. if your build isn't top-of-the-top photorealistic, you'll get downvoted and you'll prolly receive an angry letter in the mail that may or may not have some useful feedback on it.
creations-chat 2022-05-14 14:04:18 what are your ideas, rbk?
creations-chat 2022-05-14 14:23:18 <@384689306381582341> your car is a bit blocky, i'd say. the basic grey colour from the color picker doesnt help. it needs more angles, more curves.

creations-chat 2022-05-18 22:44:53 <@914605911744593930> ah, so some splodges of different colours in different areas. i can do that.

<@738091123590824000> what should i do to make it better?
creations-chat 2022-05-18 23:20:14 i need help on this camo. any tips? currently it looks stupid
creations-chat 2022-05-18 23:22:03 so like rgb 122 99 85?
creations-chat 2022-05-18 23:25:05 also, i noticed that there isn't an actual variety of colours on the jaguar. just plain tan.
creations-chat 2022-05-18 23:28:15 know what, screw it, im not making the desert camo. too hard and just looks bad.
creations-chat 2022-05-18 23:34:12 you can just see if people like it. doesnt seem to be a tutorial, so people will like it, i suppose.
creations-chat 2022-05-19 00:25:40 who is the worst?

creations-chat 2022-05-19 00:58:45 any feedback on my plane in <#384025409945337856>? any livery ideas?
creations-chat 2022-05-19 01:01:14 great livery. any more angles? it seems simple enough to make.
creations-chat 2022-05-19 01:03:01 there we go. how should i go about making the animal on the tail?
creations-chat 2022-05-19 01:48:12 alright, i have some ideas for my jaguar.

-change the livery so it isnt pure black void

-change the spine, since it doesnt go down much

-that little wing sticking out of the nose, gonna delete it.

lemmino if there is anything else i should change.

creations-chat 2022-06-11 18:44:54 i'm kinda shocked that my dc-10 went from having a ration of 7-1 to a ratio of 12-22. quite strange.

oh well, guess that means i need to work harder on the plane to make it better.
creations-chat 2022-06-11 19:23:35 i am going to explode
creations-chat 2022-06-11 20:40:38 mommy look, it's me!
creations-chat 2022-06-11 20:57:59 everyone please shut up, this argument is pointless and doesn't need to continue. the dc-10 is mid, and that is all.

creations-chat 2022-06-11 21:55:24 hey, sorry for the late response, but where specifically should i detail the plane? is it just the entire thing in general, or is there a few areas that need to be detailed?

creations-chat 2022-06-12 15:30:26 alright, i added the dip in the cockpit, and fixed the elevators. is it ok if you give me an idea on how to fix the engines? idk how to make them smaller and good.
creations-chat 2022-06-12 15:34:01 sure, id like the reference. also, sadly i cant do anything about the horizontal stabilizer's size since it collides with the end of the plot. ill try to find a solution tho.
creations-chat 2022-06-12 15:36:44 actually, i can do something about it. i just need to make this lock smaller. gimmie a sec

also, having the exhaust be black and not just be grey like the rest of the plane would be an upgrade.

creations-chat 2022-06-24 18:25:38 <@401530469952389130> honestly, for a one-wide, your plane is very stellar.

creations-chat 2023-03-02 00:57:17 ok rebuttal it was made in the 70s ok? that‚Äôs like saying a p51 sucks because it doesn‚Äôt have a jet engine, stop acting smart when you aren‚Äôt
creations-chat 2023-03-02 03:00:31 ok two things ONE.) i am 98% sure he was referring to the plane in general. a plane can still be good without having to be good in modern combat. having that expectation is absurd. TWO.) stop acting like a nerd. genuinely every time i see you talking, you‚Äôre trying to use ‚Äúfacts and logic‚Äù to ‚Äútechnically‚Äù destroy others, even though you look like a massive nerd emoji doing so. stick it with the attitude. literally every plane is going to age and be less relevant. that doesn‚Äôt mean they are bad, it‚Äôs just they haven‚Äôt adapted to the times.
creations-chat 2023-03-02 03:04:35 yes, but is that a negative??? no, its just inevitable. simple as that. yea, a p51 will suck in modern combat, and an f14 will probably struggle but that isn‚Äôt a negative.
creations-chat 2023-03-02 03:19:06 this can all be thrown out the window by simply saying that, like i stated before, IT WAS MADE IN THE FUCKING 70S, WHY ARE YOU TAKING STEALTH AND MODERN AVIONICS INTO ACCOUNT FOR A PLANE MADE IN THE 70S, DO YOU EVEN KNOW WHAT YOU SAY??
creations-chat 2023-03-02 03:28:48 i judge stuff based off how good they were at their inception, not 50 years later when they have already been outclassed. i‚Äôm not even a tomcat mfer, all im saying is 90% of pcc thinks you‚Äôre a dumbass and you need to stop acting smart to get people to like you. i was in this exact situation, and only when i stepped back and looked at myself did i realize how stupid i was. i would advise you do the same.
creations-chat 2023-03-02 03:34:01 exactly, so don‚Äôt judge it by modern standards if it wasn‚Äôt suppose to fight against f22s.
creations-chat 2023-03-02 03:39:42 you just called the plane bad because it didn‚Äôt use flashy new technology, essentially. i now get why loads of people hate you.
