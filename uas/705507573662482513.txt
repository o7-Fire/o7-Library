creations-chat 2020-11-16 15:39:30 > <@!683069192143896594>  the reason why it has so much downvotes is because of the exposed motorlock probably and the fact that the b 17 is so overrated
I agree

creations-chat 2021-05-09 20:20:47 So you looked through YouTube... And you copied a YouTuber's jet? Uhhh what

creations-chat 2021-05-10 17:08:40 That's what I call exposed lock
creations-chat 2021-05-25 19:49:47 Imagine using downvotes as an excuse for your build and saying that the community is toxic for no fricking reason <@642524491439800330>
creations-chat 2021-05-25 19:52:15 That's actually a pretty cool design and Idea but I'm not sure about the colors
creations-chat 2021-06-18 10:12:38 Hmm idk m8
No it's not bad, just the glass. It looks kinda small
creations-chat 2021-06-18 10:48:45 Yooo that's cool
creations-chat 2021-06-21 10:59:26 I'm not sure that you'd survive long. As your plane is just a gigantic target for small manuvrable planes, I also doubt it's fast and manuvrable enough to escape some small and agile jets

creations-chat 2021-10-31 07:11:11 Also thanks
creations-chat 2021-11-04 14:43:59 Ok. How did my crappy expo morto boat get 166 upvotes

Don't get me wrong, I like the build in fact I upvoted the other one but...ðŸ’€

creations-chat 2021-12-13 22:11:32 not like the scrab is a good build, but it worked for the event at least
creations-chat 2021-12-13 22:26:24 thats beautiful

events-chat 2022-01-09 01:22:16 Shall it be, 500 sps arbiter's pointer finger. Gonna pull some funny tech B)
events-chat 2022-01-09 01:22:39 I can make it go up 850 in a straight line but why
events-chat 2022-01-09 01:23:33 Well no
events-chat 2022-01-09 01:24:02 Studs are found everywhere in Roblox, but a plane crazy blocks are 2x2 studs
events-chat 2022-01-09 01:24:19 Studs per sec
events-chat 2022-01-09 01:24:35 Wow slowmode
events-chat 2022-01-09 01:25:44 Lmao so generic, oh yes I'm going 50 speed
events-chat 2022-01-09 01:26:51 But I was stopped for going mach 2 speed just yesterday!
events-chat 2022-01-09 01:27:52 Probably bobm funny detachable glitch fling aa
events-chat 2022-01-09 01:29:01 Ight imma start working on the tech, I haven't read any speed limit so I'll just exceed mach 15 by a little
events-chat 2022-01-09 01:29:26 NO
events-chat 2022-01-09 01:29:51 NONONONONONONONNO IM FINE WITJ MY MACH15 BOAT THANKS
events-chat 2022-01-09 01:30:16 Because if you do speed limit it's not even gonna be 500 or 450 sps but like 150 and that's just bruh
events-chat 2022-01-09 01:31:51 Like 450???
events-chat 2022-01-09 01:32:21 Pls at least 450
events-chat 2022-01-09 01:32:46 Ballast wait is ballast allowed
events-chat 2022-01-09 01:33:12 Very useful
events-chat 2022-01-09 01:34:11 It's explain to be complicated, but I only use them on non pvp builds since it increases water drag and decreases speed
events-chat 2022-01-09 01:34:59 Yooo hammer boat
events-chat 2022-01-09 01:48:10 Imma start working
events-chat 2022-01-09 02:58:12 Havent made a pvp boat in a while
events-chat 2022-01-09 02:58:32 I might want to keep the drag generated by the water as low as possible
events-chat 2022-01-09 02:59:09 And to achieve 800 sps, I might aswell want to balance it perfectly
events-chat 2022-01-09 02:59:39 I'm not flying, I'm using the ground effect
events-chat 2022-01-09 03:00:27 I'm not flying I'm just reducing water drag in order to achieve more speed
events-chat 2022-01-09 03:00:59 You are smart
events-chat 2022-01-09 03:01:25 We place torpedo where weak point is, maybe we even lock it in and then when we no need anymore we detach
events-chat 2022-01-09 03:01:56 I still won't have torpedos, my manuvrability and speed will be the ones of a slider tank anyways so
events-chat 2022-01-09 03:03:38 Let's go unsinkable bro's
events-chat 2022-01-09 03:04:06 Let's try not to pull a titanic tho
events-chat 2022-01-09 03:04:43 Yeah right we just don't sink
events-chat 2022-01-09 03:05:08 I have it on my inflato boat, it's pretty good decision
events-chat 2022-01-09 03:05:53 My underbelly water props can speed me up to 900 on another boat
events-chat 2022-01-09 03:07:28 Alright I'll go design that on paper now, with the most sportive approach, good luck everyone
events-chat 2022-01-09 12:49:27 <:FineTroll:626841259746656289>
events-chat 2022-01-09 12:49:44 only 225 in the screenshot
events-chat 2022-01-09 12:50:01 I can get up to 400, but I need more speed
events-chat 2022-01-09 12:50:56 nah my guy I have quite some knowledge in pvp, we aren't allowed to use tnt armor anyway
events-chat 2022-01-09 12:51:48 did I say it's finished ðŸ¤“
events-chat 2022-01-09 12:53:38 let's turn our battlebots in boats
events-chat 2022-01-09 12:53:57 shredder hammer boat let's go
events-chat 2022-01-09 12:55:02 let's go I'm making arbiter's pointer finger on rbk's request
events-chat 2022-01-09 12:56:45 nice nice, what speed are you aiming for?
events-chat 2022-01-09 12:58:28 I get what you mean, wish you the best of luck m8
events-chat 2022-01-09 13:00:23 me too since In my opinion following irl vehicles for pvp builds limits you a lot
events-chat 2022-01-09 13:01:34 <@!393858481268064266> wanna vc?
events-chat 2022-01-09 19:36:56 eh guess it's fine enough
events-chat 2022-01-09 19:37:26 I gotta add some more detail indeed
events-chat 2022-01-09 19:37:43 ***you.***
events-chat 2022-01-09 19:38:32 yes
events-chat 2022-01-09 19:38:59 ok
events-chat 2022-01-09 19:40:14 the issue is that torpedos are not going to hit me
events-chat 2022-01-09 19:40:31 because Im that small and that fast
events-chat 2022-01-09 19:41:14 does your ship go 610 sps
events-chat 2022-01-09 19:41:41 thats not how it works- its not a tank
events-chat 2022-01-09 19:42:01 
events-chat 2022-01-09 19:45:33 I haven't flown off the edge yet I have been pulling funnies for 5 minutes straight in a public pvp
events-chat 2022-01-09 19:45:55 it's not on/off only btw
events-chat 2022-01-09 20:05:10 And you are coming to tell me that I'll die quickly
events-chat 2022-01-09 20:06:26 I can turn just as fast <:trollface:775024642104229898>
events-chat 2022-01-09 20:23:00 Having torpedos or deapht charges won't help m8
events-chat 2022-01-09 20:26:23 Go on then, I have faced a public pvp server for only 5 minutes without respawning as first test phase so let's just say that I'm confident.
events-chat 2022-01-09 20:28:14 I don't care if your Yamato goes 900 or even 1k, it's gigafucking big which won't help you at all even if you are fast
events-chat 2022-01-09 20:28:37 I'm confident that's it you won't scare me off by talking
events-chat 2022-01-09 20:29:50 How many times do I have to tell you that I'm you aren't going to scare me off like that
events-chat 2022-01-09 20:30:16 I'm not
events-chat 2022-01-09 20:30:32 Very funny yes
events-chat 2022-01-09 20:30:52 Is competition talk always like this like Jesus Christ y'all think your boat is the best
events-chat 2022-01-09 20:31:14 Ok Mr grammar
events-chat 2022-01-09 20:31:41 I currently have diharrea
events-chat 2022-01-09 20:32:05 You better not
events-chat 2022-01-09 20:32:27 Got school tomorrow
events-chat 2022-01-09 20:33:27 I'm confident, I'm not going to fight you now but I'll wait for the contest indeed

events-chat 2022-01-10 06:08:54 Mini F14 dogfight
events-chat 2022-01-10 12:28:56 No I also have two turrets lmao
events-chat 2022-01-10 12:29:16 And I didn't steal your idea
events-chat 2022-01-10 12:29:32 ***because it's not your idea***
events-chat 2022-01-10 12:30:18 No it's not lmao
events-chat 2022-01-10 12:30:35 I have two turret boats aged months ago
events-chat 2022-01-10 12:31:11 It's like saying "I had the idea to add a roof to my house so you stole my idea"
events-chat 2022-01-10 12:31:55 It's not your damn idea accept it it's not even an idea in the first place
events-chat 2022-01-10 12:32:39 Every ship has the customization the builder wants, are you also not fine with others having a hull on their boat because yours has one?
events-chat 2022-01-10 12:37:18 Then why are you saying it's your idea
events-chat 2022-01-10 12:37:38 What purpose
events-chat 2022-01-10 14:33:41 sup
events-chat 2022-01-10 14:34:03 yo rbk
events-chat 2022-01-10 14:35:17 custom pt speedboat
events-chat 2022-01-10 14:36:01 it's armored and fast enough for me not to worry about rockets
events-chat 2022-01-10 14:36:19 we can't have tnt armor anyway
events-chat 2022-01-10 14:37:12 keep it stable
events-chat 2022-01-10 14:37:30 you should've made a tank ðŸ’€
events-chat 2022-01-10 15:16:24 Wow you
events-chat 2022-01-10 15:16:46 Do you still plan to build one or not
events-chat 2022-01-10 15:17:04 You got a point there, my boat is so balanced it won't flip even if I'll try to
events-chat 2022-01-10 15:17:21 Tell me how much time do you need
events-chat 2022-01-10 15:18:17 It has only full blocks on the hollow parts and the motorlock is completely covered up but I might have to add some front cover
events-chat 2022-01-10 15:18:43 Since the two motors that custom angle the front of the hull are a bit expo
events-chat 2022-01-10 15:20:19 That's shitass
events-chat 2022-01-10 15:20:49 Looks too good and performs bad
events-chat 2022-01-10 15:21:05 I balanced those two
events-chat 2022-01-10 15:21:29 Lma
events-chat 2022-01-10 15:21:44 How big
events-chat 2022-01-10 15:22:15 I'm not here to give advice since everyone has their own techniques I'm just trying to "***understand the enemy***"
events-chat 2022-01-10 15:22:57 Don't even think about it
events-chat 2022-01-10 15:23:20 He thought about it
events-chat 2022-01-10 15:23:44 I'm gonna keep mine the size that is already is
events-chat 2022-01-10 15:24:22 I agree with that for a couple of reasons
events-chat 2022-01-10 15:24:43 Expecially now that we are talking about water, size.matters but in the opposite way
events-chat 2022-01-10 15:25:03 Lemme explain why
events-chat 2022-01-10 15:30:31 Let's start off by saying that more surface in contact with water means more frame drop and less speed because of the water drag and no adding more rockets won't help.
First of all, smaller targets in PC are known in the tank pvp world for being harder to destroy because of their lower "tracking cone"
Second of all is the water surface colliding with the vehicle that really matters: the more drag generated by the water the less the top speed and manuvrability is, that's why irl smaller boats hit up to 70 Kts faster and without many issues and bigger boats don't. The way smaller boats do reach that speed is by lowering the surface of collide with the water surface leaving only the engines in the water in order to go faster so you often see their front "pointing up" but you have not seen a Yamato doing that.
events-chat 2022-01-10 15:30:51 B)
events-chat 2022-01-10 15:31:08 Technically it's not a tip
events-chat 2022-01-10 15:31:45 I was only trying to help, no need to care
events-chat 2022-01-10 15:32:01 Just giving off info
events-chat 2022-01-10 15:32:34 You didn't read anything that's why
events-chat 2022-01-10 15:32:52 Guess why torpedo boars were feared
events-chat 2022-01-10 15:33:08 It's on you seriously
events-chat 2022-01-10 15:34:16 Lemme speak unga bunga: small boat no die in one shot because no made of paper, big boat die soon because big ass so easy to hit also big ass make it slow
events-chat 2022-01-10 15:34:47 Explain then, explain why I'd make a boat out of paper and send it against a battleship
events-chat 2022-01-10 15:35:37 Because they added destroyers and made a naval fleet which you clearly won't have?
events-chat 2022-01-10 15:36:26 Not again..
events-chat 2022-01-10 15:37:48 That's all I had to say
events-chat 2022-01-10 15:38:19 That's a good point
events-chat 2022-01-10 15:38:51 https://tenor.com/view/talk-to-wall-talking-wall-brick-gif-15725457
events-chat 2022-01-10 15:39:58 So as I stated here, their manuvrability will be shitas and they'll be barely able to turn (there could be exceptions tho)
events-chat 2022-01-10 15:40:40 That won't increase your speed
events-chat 2022-01-10 15:41:15 Water generated drag will be your downfall
events-chat 2022-01-10 15:41:32 But at this point there's no more point in trying to explain you
events-chat 2022-01-10 15:41:58 <:WeirdChamp:670867805176070145>
events-chat 2022-01-10 15:42:56 Being faster helps me avoid your weapons and your size will help me destroy yours
events-chat 2022-01-10 15:43:23 Guess we'll see that in the event
events-chat 2022-01-10 15:43:39 Not like I don't have guns or rockets now
events-chat 2022-01-10 15:44:22 Who said you will even get the chance to land rounds on me
events-chat 2022-01-10 15:44:39 Before I land rounds on you
events-chat 2022-01-10 15:45:01 I'm fast you are static that's what you said isn't it
events-chat 2022-01-10 15:46:11 Being big doesn't make you invincible?
events-chat 2022-01-10 15:46:45 Whatever man you just won't understand
events-chat 2022-01-10 15:47:56 Oh my fucking got shut it already I'm not willing to be kicked out of the contest because some ass guy
events-chat 2022-01-10 15:48:13 
events-chat 2022-01-10 15:48:29 Land is not water
events-chat 2022-01-10 15:48:45 Land doesn't have the same physics as water does
events-chat 2022-01-10 15:51:37 <@707953054489509978> let him do what he wants, I'd honestly avoid being kicked out of the event uh?
events-chat 2022-01-10 15:52:37 We'll see that in the event fights, big ass boat gang
events-chat 2022-01-10 15:56:06 We have the same ammount of weapons
events-chat 2022-01-10 15:56:23 I personally used all of them
events-chat 2022-01-10 16:34:36 I'll join too as soon as I'm finished with funny homework ðŸ¥²

events-chat 2022-01-11 17:20:19 Ah that's new to me
events-chat 2022-01-11 17:20:36 Don't gotta get on the toxic side fuckass
events-chat 2022-01-11 17:24:06 I didn't know water with thing was a glitch, and sarcasm
events-chat 2022-01-11 17:25:18 So you cant use sarcasm in this chat
events-chat 2022-01-11 17:25:34 Because people won't understand?
events-chat 2022-01-11 17:26:39 I don't get it but fine
events-chat 2022-01-12 13:04:38 *do I have to say it again?*
events-chat 2022-01-12 13:04:54 That's some good speed tho
events-chat 2022-01-12 13:05:30 Yooo you got "GET REAL" on your boat I got "YOU ARE BAD LOL" on mine
events-chat 2022-01-12 13:05:58 Might change it to mad cuz bad

events-chat 2022-01-12 13:41:33 impressive
events-chat 2022-01-12 14:31:34 lets goooo
events-chat 2022-01-12 14:33:40 that's how you make a pvp boat <:lmfao:527971550360633393>
events-chat 2022-01-12 14:34:18 I couldn't make it go 1k yet <:4Weird:709084058721714324>
events-chat 2022-01-12 14:34:52 Ah.
events-chat 2022-01-12 14:35:37 mine gots up to 950 but max screenshotted speed is 926
events-chat 2022-01-12 14:36:21 I have my tactics
events-chat 2022-01-12 14:36:42 not like Ill go up to 950 in the arena
events-chat 2022-01-12 14:36:59 why would somebody
events-chat 2022-01-12 14:37:30 aircraft carrier alone dont survive
events-chat 2022-01-12 14:40:48 he wants to die asap
events-chat 2022-01-12 14:41:32 why do people think that someone would make a fast boat ad then dont focus on turning aswell <:OkBuddy:652567204453154816>
events-chat 2022-01-12 14:43:17 I have rocket turning, prop assisted
events-chat 2022-01-12 14:43:34 Props are for the left and right pitch
events-chat 2022-01-12 14:43:50 Rocket is for funny
events-chat 2022-01-12 14:45:08 That's why I added props for the pitch
events-chat 2022-01-12 14:45:26 Also that thing ain't rolling over anytime soon, I tried to but it just won't
events-chat 2022-01-12 14:47:51 That's going to backfire on you in the battle yk
events-chat 2022-01-12 14:48:16 It's going to limit your movement a lot,
events-chat 2022-01-12 14:48:34 I'll just go fast and I shouldn't have any issue
events-chat 2022-01-12 14:49:16 Do you really think that will stop me? Not even sea mines can
events-chat 2022-01-12 14:49:32 There are certain advantages of going 450 during a fight you know
events-chat 2022-01-12 14:49:49 But I mean, it's on you
events-chat 2022-01-12 14:50:13 My speed is still 950 <:m_:778994206948589638>
events-chat 2022-01-12 14:51:07 Go on, there's only so much propellers a design can handle and for what I saw, you have some issues with "being a dolphin"
events-chat 2022-01-12 14:51:23 The Key to speed is to reduce water drag
events-chat 2022-01-12 14:51:46 No sea mines issue, harder to hit
events-chat 2022-01-12 14:52:04 The harder to hit thing is relative to my opponent tho
events-chat 2022-01-12 14:52:38 I can commit mach 10 out of the way
events-chat 2022-01-12 14:53:22 I will still keep my speed relatively low at around 500 during s fight
events-chat 2022-01-12 14:53:42 Good to hear
events-chat 2022-01-12 14:55:00 You haven't even seen my boat in action and you already got a wrong statement, congrats
events-chat 2022-01-12 14:55:24 You are annoying as fuck

events-chat 2022-01-14 12:26:20 Up to 950, max recorded speed on a screenshots is 926 but I usually fight at 300/450
events-chat 2022-01-14 12:27:33 And yes, I am manuvrable enough to reach that speed without any concequence aka falling off the map or going flying
events-chat 2022-01-14 12:29:00 You are understimating me
events-chat 2022-01-14 12:32:49 Switch from fight mode (up 450 SPS Max) to speed mode (925+)

events-chat 2022-01-14 19:41:35 yeah I can go up to 1k but that doesnt mean I fight at such speeds
events-chat 2022-01-14 19:41:52 I limit myself at 450/350
