help 2022-11-13 20:48:00 anyone knows what's wrong with that motorlock?

help 2022-11-13 20:53:06 if u meant like that it didn't work
help 2022-11-13 20:53:11 essentially same result
help 2022-11-13 20:58:08 no change of result again

help 2022-11-13 21:00:38 after lock

help 2022-11-14 00:13:55 anyone knows how to make a custom angle for cylinders? everything i tried either fell off or wouldnt quite work properly
help 2022-11-14 01:03:10 do you mind showing me an example? I dont't quite get the idea
help 2022-11-14 01:08:43 fairs
help 2022-11-17 18:42:05 anyone knows why hover thrusters have this weird ability to just fuck over my motorlocks? and how do I fix it?
help 2022-11-17 18:42:57 ah yes
help 2022-11-17 18:47:12 ojk nvm its all engines or wtv

anyways, if i put any engine in the gaps here, my whole motorlock tower just ignores the half block I added to it, anyone knows how that could be possible? and how fix
