creations-chat 2021-07-18 01:07:27 <@!744540626980307081> cockpit looks alot like mig21
creations-chat 2021-07-22 13:25:37 Because now it’s impossible to get upvote based roles because if it’s not motorlocked, cameralocked, and 101% accurate then it gets downvoted to hell even if it looks decent. The bar is set too high with all the pro builders, and PCC can’t seem to get the fact that 80% of players can’t build like them.
creations-chat 2021-07-22 13:36:39 Honestly I think they should have 2 suggestions channels, one for low/no ranks and one for experts. Of course everyone can vote in each channel but maybe the experts will have the bar lowered for the noob channel
creations-chat 2021-07-22 13:40:34 Says one who probably downvotes 80% of creations
creations-chat 2021-07-22 13:44:45 Yeah it might be easy for someone to feel offended when the build they spent 5 hours on gets downvoted to hell and completely ignored if they asked for feedback. I ask a lot and am often ignored.

creations-chat 2022-02-26 22:38:37 This was the reference <@456226577798135808>
creations-chat 2022-02-26 22:44:06 If you’re gonna call it a certain plane then at least make it as close as you can with your skill level

creations-chat 2022-02-27 00:19:21 legacy glass probably. Change it to either a solid grey with no glass or just normal glass
creations-chat 2022-02-27 00:24:40 Then don’t get pissed that people downvoted it if you didn’t take the time to take a good picture…

creations-chat 2022-03-23 19:59:21 Judging from the above complaining about repetitive helicopters I should refrain from posting my ah-1
creations-chat 2022-03-29 00:23:44 I don’t care what anyone says, fleet is legit the reason why mental hospitals exist. He is the reason why schools have shortbuses. Ima get hate for this but, Fleet is the real furry, mans hating on a good build because his self esteem is too low for him to be satisfied with himself and not be a jerk to people just because they haven’t learned all the best stuff. There is a difference between needlessly putting someone down and offering them good advice without being a <a:clownmoment:901997389332750336>
creations-chat 2022-03-29 00:25:46 Not so much trying as simply saying what needs to be said. I understand it’s futile but I’m just pointing out a fundamental issue with the community as a whole.
creations-chat 2022-03-29 00:28:03 ok 😐
creations-chat 2022-03-29 00:33:22 You sound like a living breathing version of an Xbox live chat room in 2009

Freedom of speech bozo
creations-chat 2022-03-29 00:35:28 Nice nice, sounds like you learned many important lessons there

When you have to go back several months to find “irrelevant” insults
creations-chat 2022-03-29 00:38:32 Damn that’s impressive, you should try speed running GTA. It’s pretty hard but really fun
creations-chat 2022-03-29 00:40:43 Bro I’ll legit gift it right now to see you livestream that. It might be funny to see someone new try it out
creations-chat 2022-03-29 00:42:49 GTA came out in 2013 id be surprised if you couldn’t run it. Basically just needs a potato with a cpu to run

Makes sense.
creations-chat 2022-03-29 00:44:53 Propellor is thicker than the fuselage lol
creations-chat 2022-03-29 13:54:03 Carrier in pvp = no chance
creations-chat 2022-03-30 04:25:38 
creations-chat 2022-03-30 14:04:41 Don’t use carrier in pvp, for defense maybe just spam rocket and gun turrets. Maybe lava spitters for bugs who get up close. This is all assuming you want to use every available weapon
creations-chat 2022-03-30 14:08:02 It’s fine but if you want success in pvp then consider switching to a smaller more maneuverable boat, like a pt or something

creations-chat 2022-05-02 17:17:00 Also instead of using cylinders for the logs you could use sparklers, they’re much thinner and probably better in any case
