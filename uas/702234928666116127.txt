creations-chat 2021-03-18 23:13:23 thanks for the feedback, but this would mean that I have to get rid of some of the detailing on the bow and stern since those lines are ballast tanks. But im sure it would be worth it

creations-chat 2021-04-03 01:52:31 <@!701949629708632096> look at the ratio of wheel size to the boiler, it‚Äôs completely accurate there‚Äôs just a lot of piping and other stuff in between
creations-chat 2021-04-03 21:23:21 Is this good or no (WIP)
creations-chat 2021-04-03 21:25:28 Who pinged

creations-chat 2021-04-04 22:05:21 ü§î
creations-chat 2021-04-04 22:07:23 ikr he so mean!!!11!111!1
creations-chat 2021-04-04 23:48:15 progress yay (yes boiler is a bit too big I will fix)
creations-chat 2021-04-05 01:51:45 <@!272165213372153856> no rail system?! wait nvm I see it now sorry
creations-chat 2021-04-05 02:08:41 hows it goin
creations-chat 2021-04-05 02:10:42 white name is typing
creations-chat 2021-04-05 02:12:43 Im gonna fit the boiler with half blocks instead of regular blocks to see if that fixes the problem and yes I will add more details later on
creations-chat 2021-04-05 02:20:58 I tried but they stick out and its extremely visible so Idk what to do also yes it is the big boy steam loco
creations-chat 2021-04-06 03:13:52 and this is why I avoid creations feedback
creations-chat 2021-04-06 03:15:59 boiler is too big :(((((
creations-chat 2021-04-06 03:27:39 <@!582834773773254656> <@!398245378861826048>
creations-chat 2021-04-06 03:30:03 The wheels are actually a lot smaller than the boiler now that I look at it but all of the piping in between the boiler and the actual wheels gives it the illusion that they're bigger

Also you know which steam locomotive this is correct?
creations-chat 2021-04-06 20:22:27 how do I make connecting rods that dont stick out so fuckin much
creations-chat 2021-04-06 20:32:11 be more elaborate
creations-chat 2021-04-06 20:58:04 I just need a design that only portrudes a half block out and can go through curves
creations-chat 2021-04-06 22:20:20 <@!721109225463349428> that UP loco is pretty neat
creations-chat 2021-04-07 02:04:15 new paint job, it looks like a toy with the current one
creations-chat 2021-04-07 02:26:41 welcome to the PCC
creations-chat 2021-04-08 21:53:32 is that the big boy locomotive?
creations-chat 2021-04-08 21:55:39 currently working on this one
creations-chat 2021-04-08 21:58:17 I invite you to look at the photo above my friend
creations-chat 2021-04-08 22:00:19 I havent added all of the piping and whatnot in between the boiler and the frame so it looks a bit weird
creations-chat 2021-04-08 22:04:25 kinda impossible since the frame was made for that wheel size only, bigger wheels would mean remaking the entire thing
creations-chat 2021-04-08 22:21:36 your one rail idea is somewhat cool but just make actual trains pls
creations-chat 2021-04-10 02:53:32 good detailing but proportions are innacurate
creations-chat 2021-04-10 03:00:44 compare <@456226577798135808>
creations-chat 2021-04-10 03:03:07 frame of the locomotive is much much longer, cab is fine but the black part is way too short
creations-chat 2021-04-10 03:05:19 unless youre already planning to fold it
