creations-chat 2020-10-25 11:31:06 > No they won't..? You can clip stuff into the ground and have stuff down there I just don't know how it works
> I want to clip a bunker down there and have a "pop up" Maginot line turret
<@!407347404858458123>  best thing i can think of is to get the bunker hang off the base
creations-chat 2020-10-25 11:32:22 clipping stuff underground is possible, just that nothing would work
creations-chat 2020-10-25 11:34:22 if you’re planning to make it pop up, no.
creations-chat 2020-10-25 11:39:29 or you can get it underwater (not recommended) as water will fill in the base, meaning your avatar will swim inside the base. Which makes it extremely hard to move around. Also having terrible visibility
