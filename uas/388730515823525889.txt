creations-chat 2022-06-23 09:14:48 with some twists it could look rlly cool
creations-chat 2022-06-23 09:18:53 that's some insecurity problems you got over there man
just like you never were at a point where you were starting like this man right here
you can be a bit more constructive and less rude and still transmit the same, don't u think

creations-chat 2022-07-08 20:15:44 Certainly a good idea, I see how I could make it work and I could give an use to the spinning compass I made
creations-chat 2022-07-08 20:25:18 The revolver thing might be hard to make but I can certainly try it
creations-chat 2022-07-08 20:39:54 Ooooh right right could work

the-dump 2022-07-25 10:40:24 Yeah game I'm working on 
Vid by my amazing head dev who made the guns
Just sending here bc it's a large archive  and the server has nitro ðŸ˜Ž
the-dump 2022-07-25 12:58:58 Sure
the-dump 2022-07-25 18:27:03 we know mp34 is an smg
it's a placeholder model because otherwise we would have to showcase with a bLOCk
we made the scripts and actual 3d models for us are on their way but it's not as fancy
the-dump 2022-07-25 18:27:11 appreciate the other inf
