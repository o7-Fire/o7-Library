help 2022-06-13 16:51:19 i'm making an f8e and i think its missing something but can't figure out what
creations-chat 2022-07-04 02:42:54 alright
creations-chat 2022-07-04 02:45:10 The sight works by pushing a wing panel back connected to suspension that pushes the sight foreward, adjusting to speed https://streamable.com/bxhe5u
creations-chat 2022-07-04 02:47:16 the line you see next to the plus shows the exact roll of the aircraft in order to make it easier to adjust. in order for the most accurate bomb, you need as level of a trajectory as possible, otherwise the sight is useless 

The biggest limitation of the sight is altitude. because of the physics in plane crazy, an object that is falling (that doesnt have any wing panels attached) will fall in the shape of an exponential function, making it impossible to use at any altitude. i made it so that it will only accurately predict at 1000 studs

the last component of the sight is the zoom which is a simple half ball which when your camera is close to it, it zooms


pls inventor rank

creations-chat 2022-07-04 03:02:29 you can adjust it so that you can bomb at lower altitudes, i just set it so high to show the accuracy of the sight
