creations-chat 2023-01-05 06:22:44 how do you define 'Good Creations'
creations-chat 2023-01-05 06:36:34 A good creation? something fun, something glitchy, a machine that either simulates physics or breaks it. Something you can pull out of your saves and have a fun roleplay, or something you can reproduce with ease.
creations-chat 2023-01-05 06:39:36 even with the given complexity we can have in this game, we must not forget that Rickje's intetions were to give us a game for fun, and fun wont be achieved with looks alone
creations-chat 2023-01-05 07:23:57 why does that guy hate roleplay
creations-chat 2023-01-05 07:30:27 you never had a simulation tank combat roleplay? i had fun with 6 friends in european and soviet tanks

creations-chat 2023-01-09 12:05:15 
creations-chat 2023-01-09 12:13:09 my detachable f1 wheels were made with the intent to have the ability to replace the wheels, thus needing pit crew. i hit a wall, the wheel flew, and next thing i know i was heavily invested in flying wheels
creations-chat 2023-01-09 12:15:43 everything can look like a tutorial
creations-chat 2023-01-09 12:18:21 i definitely did a senna into a wall <@551376778552410113>  my F1 is a Benetton-Renault B195, i think the rope you were talking about was not present in this type of chassis (94-95 grand prix)
creations-chat 2023-01-09 12:23:13 there are lots of good things about Formula one in the 90s, one of them is having a V12 engine. You cant master a 'V12 Monster' in today's F1 games, for that you'd have to go back to the PlayStation and play F1 96
creations-chat 2023-01-09 12:28:38 that is true, the only Codemasters F1 game that i think feels realistic is the first one <@773474989751664640> whats ip log
