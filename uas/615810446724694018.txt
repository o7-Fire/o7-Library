creations-chat 2020-07-02 11:39:11 The Challenge 2. Blocks = 1901. Suspension wheels. Pretty simple paintjob i kept it plain instead of camo because the real challenge 2 isnt a camo tank. This is my first time making a tank at this scale.

creations-chat 2020-07-15 08:15:02 <@!587459840255983616> You can use cylinders if u want (You can use ways to mesh the wheels together, eg. Pistons, fine meshing, locked motors) The advantages of using cylinders allows you to use gear ratios which you need for a realistic car mechanics. I actually tried to make a car that works like a car irl but failed
creations-chat 2020-07-15 08:17:44 just saying, cylinders are better than water wheels for gears cause cylinders vary in size while water wheels do not. You can implement gear ratios for a better working/ realistic car. Trust me, I'm an expert in gears and messed/experimented with gears in plane crazy
creations-chat 2020-07-15 08:19:12 but just do what you think will work better. Im just saying
creations-chat 2020-07-16 06:05:59 > <@!615810446724694018> if I use cylinders it doesn’t really catch easily, at first I had it use cylinders but friction slips and it didn’t allow me to shift easily because of the friction, so I tried using a gear using trails and wing panels but that didn’t have enough spokes, so I decided to use water wheels, then I realized u can’t hook blocks to them so I motorlocked a trail beam into it so they all move as one and to also hook it up to the rear wheels
<@!587459840255983616> fair enough
creations-chat 2020-07-16 06:06:13 i just wish they added actual gears in the game
creations-chat 2020-07-16 06:06:25 imagine the possibilities
creations-chat 2020-07-16 06:17:35 <@!587459840255983616> im just saying, using water wheels doesnt allow you to use gear ratios cause they don't vary in size
creations-chat 2020-07-16 06:17:46 they have a fixed number of teeth
creations-chat 2020-07-16 06:20:15 search up "gear ratios" and you'll see what trying to say
creations-chat 2020-07-16 06:21:12 one rotation of a 5X1 gear is = to 5 rotations of a I x I gear
creations-chat 2020-07-16 06:21:47 i think water wheels can only weld on the sides

creations-chat 2020-08-06 12:54:39 I made a working car transmission. For all the ppl that don't know what it does, It basically controls the speed/torque of the engine.

Colour codes:
Red, Green, Blue = Engine Shaft, Counter Shaft, Drive Shaft
Yellow, Aqua, Brownish Orange = Gear 1, Gear 2, Gear 3.

Gear 1 and gear 2 work properly but If I this game and ACTUAL GEARS gear 3 would work as well (It doesnt work cause cylinders as gears are friction-based and gearing up produces less torque. Gear 1 has low speed but high torque, Gear 2 has medium speed and medium torque and gear 3 is supposed to be high speed less torque. Feel free to copy.

help 2020-09-02 22:56:37 > <@!615810446724694018> Oi thats because the thrust from the tail rotor is pushing your heli to the side. Research "translating Tendancy", you might need to cram in a magnet drive or super rocket sideways because plane crazy doesnt have airfoils yet :/
<@!133332036441079809> So do I tilt my top rotor to counter the drift

bug-reports 2020-09-02 23:00:49 <@!586086848833519617> Its most likely your swashplate. I used to have the same problem with my old swashplate, I couldn't pitch down and up and it would just tilt diagonally. If you can't design your own swashplate, just look for a compact one on youtube.

bug-reports 2020-09-05 07:16:28 Btw the motors werent the things unwelding, My prop was spinning too fast and I think lag made it look like it unwelded
bug-reports 2020-09-05 07:16:45 When I used hover engines, It just completely ignored Gyroscopic precession
bug-reports 2020-09-05 07:17:04 cause I was using hover engines to spin the blades since it provided more thrust
bug-reports 2020-09-05 07:18:14 > Hover engine placement is really important because they are hella powerful. Did you put them on your aerodynamic and center of mass on the dot, or offset?
<@!133332036441079809> I put the Hover engines on the tip of my rotor blades, When I use hover engines to spin my blades it completely ignored gyroscopic precession
bug-reports 2020-09-05 07:20:07 Gyroscopic precession applies to objects that spin, When a force is applied to the spinning object, the force is applied 90 degrees later. When I use hover engines to spin my blades, It completely ignores it and has no delay

creations-chat 2020-09-07 05:11:25 > <@!615810446724694018> why did you put suspension on the blades? What benefit does it provide?
<@!133332036441079809> dampening
creations-chat 2020-09-07 05:11:53 no
creations-chat 2020-09-07 05:12:18 THe blades go side to side, If I didn't add dampening then the movement would be rough
creations-chat 2020-09-07 05:13:55 The blades are capable of moving side to side. I limit the movement by using unpowered motor 2. If I didn't add the suspension, when it hits the limit it would just hit the limit hard.

<@456226577798135808> Doesnt work
creations-chat 2020-09-12 02:10:47 Wheel blocks have better design
creations-chat 2020-09-12 02:10:54 I dont lie cylinders
creations-chat 2020-09-12 02:10:57 like*
creations-chat 2020-09-12 02:12:00 <@456226577798135808> Cylinders as wheel for my black hawk doesnt work I tried. I like the design of wheels. Cylinders and motors are bland. Wheels add more depth
creations-chat 2020-09-12 05:53:08 <@!719059654113755137> Your thing isn't a gyro. It is a pendulum. People these days keep messing up gyros and pendulums

creations-chat 2020-09-12 11:37:06 <:WeirdChamp:670867805176070145>
creations-chat 2020-09-12 11:37:17 <@456226577798135808> That isn't a swashplate
creations-chat 2020-09-12 11:38:21 I cannot see anyway for you to include cyclic pitching
creations-chat 2020-09-12 11:38:51 that really isnt a swashplate
creations-chat 2020-09-12 11:39:27 I think your mixing up swashplates and fake-lookalike swashplates
creations-chat 2020-09-12 11:40:05 You don't even have control rods
creations-chat 2020-09-12 11:40:13 and if those locked motors were control rods
creations-chat 2020-09-12 11:40:47 I see no way to be able to make the blades rotate
creations-chat 2020-09-12 11:40:53 to pitch and roll
creations-chat 2020-09-12 11:43:24 <@456226577798135808> So don't go around fooling everyone about swashplates that don't even work
creations-chat 2020-09-12 11:44:50 All your doing is rotating the whole rotor
creations-chat 2020-09-12 11:44:55 not the individual blades
creations-chat 2020-09-12 11:44:58 that isnt a swashpalte
creations-chat 2020-09-12 11:45:07 He is claiming its a swashpalte
creations-chat 2020-09-12 11:45:09 but it isnt
creations-chat 2020-09-12 11:45:14 he is rotating the whole rotor
creations-chat 2020-09-12 11:45:18 Swashplates dont
creations-chat 2020-09-12 11:45:28 he doesnt even have control rods
creations-chat 2020-09-12 11:45:53 its just collective pitching (The ability to control the lift)
creations-chat 2020-09-12 11:46:13 he is just tilting the whole rotor not individual blades
creations-chat 2020-09-12 11:48:33 <@456226577798135808> this is what a real swashplate should look like
creations-chat 2020-09-12 11:50:12 <@456226577798135808> see how the blades can tilt individually to pitch and roll?
creations-chat 2020-09-12 11:50:19 dont be fooled by a fake swashplate
creations-chat 2020-09-12 11:50:56 a guy posted a fake swashplate
creations-chat 2020-09-12 11:51:01 that isnt even realistic
creations-chat 2020-09-12 11:51:10 all he is doing is tilting the whole rotor
creations-chat 2020-09-12 11:51:59 cause this game needs resizable parts
creations-chat 2020-09-12 11:52:03 to be able to fit
creations-chat 2020-09-12 11:52:06 blocks are too big
creations-chat 2020-09-12 12:01:20 who else gets demotivated when their creation gets loads of downvotes
creations-chat 2020-09-12 12:03:24 never thought of that
creations-chat 2020-09-12 12:03:39 no wonder I see ppl that downvoted my build downvote like 5 others as well
creations-chat 2020-09-12 12:04:02 lol
creations-chat 2020-09-12 12:04:36 All i can see is you tilting the whole rotor
creations-chat 2020-09-12 12:04:40 not individual blades
creations-chat 2020-09-12 12:04:59 But I can see it can't tilt the blades
creations-chat 2020-09-12 12:05:32 I can't see any possible way to individually tilt the blades
creations-chat 2020-09-12 12:05:40 Even if you claim that it can
creations-chat 2020-09-12 12:05:44 I dont see any way
creations-chat 2020-09-12 12:05:59 If you used ropes as control rods I would believe it
creations-chat 2020-09-12 12:06:17 Swashplates tilt the blades individually
creations-chat 2020-09-12 12:06:19 not the whole rotor
creations-chat 2020-09-12 12:06:44 Swashplates don't even tilt a single bit of the whole rotor
creations-chat 2020-09-12 12:07:11 bruh do you even know what a swashplate is
creations-chat 2020-09-12 12:07:24 They tilt the blades individually to pitch and roll
creations-chat 2020-09-12 12:07:36 You are tilting the whole rotor
creations-chat 2020-09-12 12:07:38 Bruh
creations-chat 2020-09-12 12:07:43 You have no idea what your talking about
creations-chat 2020-09-12 12:07:52 IK WHAT U JUST SAID
creations-chat 2020-09-12 12:08:10 all your doing is tilting the blades to gain lift, not to roll and pitch
creations-chat 2020-09-12 12:08:20 i saw your video....
creations-chat 2020-09-12 12:08:27 "helicopter technician"
creations-chat 2020-09-12 12:09:47 You litterly stated that you tilt the entire rotor
creations-chat 2020-09-12 12:10:27 ok prove to me that the blades can tilt individually
creations-chat 2020-09-12 12:10:30 to pitch and roll
creations-chat 2020-09-12 12:11:33 Uhh <@!314383347214319616>
creations-chat 2020-09-12 12:11:45 <@456226577798135808> read what he said please
creations-chat 2020-09-12 12:12:05 I was telling robo rail to read what you said
creations-chat 2020-09-12 12:13:29 "which angles each blade up at a somewhat random angle between 5-19degrees"
**Each blade** Just proves you dont tilt each blade individually
creations-chat 2020-09-12 12:18:07 lmao you actaully had the guts to downvote my build since we had an argument how your "swashplate" was fake

help 2020-09-21 12:13:51 instead of ban evading
help 2020-09-21 12:14:06 this only happens if an account was banned before your main was banned

help 2020-09-21 12:56:49 still counts tho
help 2020-09-21 12:57:30 ban evasion is when someone makes a new account to bypass ban
help 2020-09-21 12:58:22 My friend got banned from a roblox discord server. He was acting nice and was a mod
help 2020-09-21 12:58:28 once the admins found out he ban evaded
help 2020-09-21 12:58:31 got perm banned
help 2020-09-21 12:59:01 Even though his ban from his main account was already passed
help 2020-09-21 12:59:26 You expect every criminal in prison stays a bad person?
help 2020-09-21 13:00:05 I am helping jojo to understand why the guy should be banned

help 2020-09-21 13:00:43 no matter who nice you act
help 2020-09-21 13:00:47 ban evasion is ban evasion
help 2020-09-21 13:01:14 yes
help 2020-09-21 13:01:22 it isnt a behaviour thing
help 2020-09-21 13:01:33 if you act nice but ban evaded
help 2020-09-21 13:01:39 you can get banned if you get caught
help 2020-09-21 13:02:24 he used vpn
help 2020-09-21 13:02:40 this account didnt exist when his main was still in this server
help 2020-09-21 13:03:09 and your assumption was true, he would have still broken another rule, **No Alt Accounts**
help 2020-09-21 13:03:42 Still kinda unfair how his main wasnt perm banned since he broke **Discords T&C**

bot-central 2020-09-27 10:25:51 -mapsuggest Add bigger water areas. Such as lakes, rivers. Another unique suggest, **Add a dam** Make the dam pretty high and up in the mountains. Add a feature so that people can break the dam and every 10 min, the dam resets.
bot-central 2020-09-27 10:32:28 -mapsuggest If you are going to add new mountains and stuff that is tall,** Make them somewhat proportianate**. I don't like how a 7 block build is as tall as the plateau. Another suggestion, Add weather. **Some suggestions are, Fog, rain, storm, hurricane, tornado, tsunami, hail**. Each of these affects the vehicle in a specific way. Hail and tsunami can destroy vehicles and everything else displaces vehicles.
bot-central 2020-09-28 13:53:16 -mapsuggest I know this may sound a bit absurd, but I suggest make the map 10x bigger than the current one. Yes I know its absoloutly ridiculous. But this is the only way to get what everybody wants. A really commons suggestion is caves. A bigger map = bigger caves.

help 2020-10-03 12:40:44 Looks or mechanics
help 2020-10-03 12:40:57 Hmmm
help 2020-10-03 12:41:09 Is the center of mass lined up with the prop?
help 2020-10-03 12:41:10 Oh
help 2020-10-03 12:41:20 Is it random or consistent?
help 2020-10-03 12:41:25 The banking
help 2020-10-03 12:41:47 Can you show me more pics of the heli?
help 2020-10-03 12:41:52 In build mode
help 2020-10-03 12:43:37 Hmmm
help 2020-10-03 12:44:26 Are the props only used for lift?
help 2020-10-03 12:45:33 Is it banking left or rotating
help 2020-10-03 12:46:14 Are the rocket engines compressed into one block?
help 2020-10-03 12:46:43 Well that is your problem then
help 2020-10-03 12:46:54 Think of it like this
help 2020-10-03 12:47:08 Imagine lifting yo ur phone on its center of mass while lifting
help 2020-10-03 12:47:20 It’s going to fall off
help 2020-10-03 12:47:38 That’s what is happening Rn
help 2020-10-03 12:47:55 Cause your lifting it on the center of mass
help 2020-10-03 12:48:09 Any external force applied to it
help 2020-10-03 12:48:25 That lift needs to be spread throughout the heli
help 2020-10-03 12:48:46 You need rocket engines spread inside the heli
help 2020-10-03 12:48:57 Not just center of mass
help 2020-10-03 12:49:36 In or on the rotor
help 2020-10-03 12:50:21 Np
help 2020-10-03 12:51:00 Well the rotor helps
help 2020-10-03 12:51:06 Cause the lift is spread out
help 2020-10-03 12:51:18 So the body shape doesn’t really matter
help 2020-10-03 12:55:27 If the rockets are placed inline
help 2020-10-03 12:55:35 It won’t really make a difference
help 2020-10-03 12:55:50 Make sure the rockets aren’t placed inline
help 2020-10-03 12:56:12 Don’t place it <:Upvote:490311647492309004> that way
help 2020-10-03 12:56:17 Inline that way
help 2020-10-03 12:56:26 Cause it will still bank
help 2020-10-03 13:04:57 Don’t place them in a linear formation
help 2020-10-03 13:05:07 Omg I’m over complacating it
help 2020-10-03 13:05:21 Spread them out evenly
help 2020-10-03 13:05:48 You should really just use your rotor to get lift
help 2020-10-03 13:05:51 It’s way easier
help 2020-10-03 13:05:55 And less complex
help 2020-10-03 13:06:12 Add 2 rotors
help 2020-10-03 13:06:17 To counter the spin
help 2020-10-03 13:08:50 hmm

help 2020-10-03 13:25:44 Is it cause it spins?
help 2020-10-03 13:25:57 Well add wing pannels to the back of the heli
help 2020-10-03 13:26:01 to resist the spin
help 2020-10-03 13:26:13 add a tail rotor then
help 2020-10-03 13:26:17 ye
help 2020-10-03 13:26:24 are you using rocket engines?
help 2020-10-03 13:26:26 or motor
help 2020-10-03 13:26:49 you have to barely angle the blades
help 2020-10-03 13:27:00 or else it will make it spin
help 2020-10-03 13:27:13 yes
help 2020-10-03 13:27:20 thats what I did to my big helis
help 2020-10-03 13:27:31 I used 3 hover engines for each blade
help 2020-10-03 13:27:38 for my old heli

help 2020-10-03 13:29:12 basically hover engines break the pitching
help 2020-10-03 13:29:28 you can use compressed rocket engines
help 2020-10-03 13:30:25 make sure
help 2020-10-03 13:30:26 the tail rotor
help 2020-10-03 13:30:32 lines up with the center of mass
help 2020-10-03 13:30:39 or else when you try to yaw
help 2020-10-03 13:30:46 your heli will end up rolling
help 2020-10-03 13:32:09 ?
help 2020-10-03 13:52:23 <@!582834773773254656> thats why you need a flapping hinge

creations-chat 2020-10-12 12:12:18 > softcoding is easier said than done expecially for rick
<@!582834773773254656> From my experience, soft coding is basically how organized your code is. If your code isn't organized, thigns can break easily

help 2020-10-22 03:43:58 <@!323120963015147521> its spinning because you either have 1 rotor and dont have a tail rotor
creations-chat 2020-10-22 12:17:09 its either on inverted or the center of mass. Cause the center of mass basically dictates mouse control.
creations-chat 2020-10-22 12:18:37 oh that normally happens. It isn't a bug its probably the location of your mouse and camera right before you spawn. Cause I had a mouse controlled turret before and I had to face directly forward and my mouse in the center so it doesnt invert

help 2020-11-09 20:59:58 > <@!526713899958140928> that's called dissymmetry of lift from what I see, it's basically wind wanna do funny with the rotor spinning in one way, so now it kinda tilts the helicopter, one way to fix it is by ~~swashplate~~ having more control over your helicopter or by fine-tuning the weight, this effect also applies to the tail rotor, so putting it on the other side might help, otherwise add delta wing in the direction the rotor is spinning
<@!437152336176087052> You can also fix it by using a fully articulated rotor system. That is what the flapping hinges are for
help 2020-11-09 21:01:11 Putting the tail rotor on the other side wont really do anything tho
help 2020-11-09 21:01:19 cause its mainly caused by the main rotor
help 2020-11-09 21:01:48 
help 2020-11-09 21:02:03 To simplify this digram,
help 2020-11-09 21:02:49 One side has a blade tilting: "/" and the other is tilting: "\"
help 2020-11-09 21:03:46 when your heli is moving forward
help 2020-11-09 21:03:58 since won blade is producing upward and the other downard
help 2020-11-09 21:04:01 it causes it to roll
help 2020-11-09 21:04:17 its easier to understand this concept if you imagine the main rotor not spinning

creations-chat 2021-01-01 13:10:31 <@!712273624865701921>Something perfectly balanced doesnt mean its perfectly stable. Attach that to a heli fuselage it wont be stable anymore.
creations-chat 2021-01-01 13:15:22 <@!712273624865701921> If you want the most stable heli rotor you need to take in accounts like dissymmetry of lift, translating tendency, coriolis effect, etc. You need a fully articulated rotor system to make a perfectly stable rotor. All you have is a perfectly balanced one.
