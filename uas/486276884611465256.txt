creations-chat 2020-12-21 15:48:23 camo is a bit bland and the intakes could be rounder, but nice <@!471334132803436545>
help 2020-12-21 15:54:54 blocks float naturally i think
creations-chat 2020-12-21 15:55:09 yes yes
creations-chat 2020-12-21 15:57:32 Paint job is kinda sad (no offense), default rocket engines (could have made custom engines), its kinda lacking detail, and is plain basically
creations-chat 2020-12-21 16:11:05 Depends, stripe camo takes more time and patience and generally gets a better result, splatter/spotted camo doesnt take as long but wont look as good
example of stripe camo https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/384025409945337856/782676289742962708/RobloxScreenShot20201129_123406913.png?width=940&height=492 <@!697600896615448578>
creations-chat 2020-12-21 16:15:04 or something like this (not done)
creations-chat 2020-12-21 16:18:15 Splatter camo looks better on non planes, it sorta acts as artificial weathering and paint imperfections
creations-chat 2020-12-21 16:20:18 Itll only look good if you motor lock wedges, cant really get sharp edges with blocks
creations-chat 2020-12-21 16:22:22 Yeah same, varied stripes that change angles are kinda not too easy for me, so I use semi-consistent angles
creations-chat 2020-12-21 16:33:10 Move the rear stabs forward, and for the camo, its kinda trial and error, you do whatever and if it looks nice you keep it, if it doesnt, you redo it
creations-chat 2020-12-21 16:38:03 the pitch wings, the wings that make plane go uppy downy, the go up go down wings
creations-chat 2020-12-21 16:41:02 next to the rockets, under the vert stabs would look better
creations-chat 2020-12-21 16:50:10 its too consistent, looks like checkerboard. Make it more "random" and natural
creations-chat 2020-12-21 18:51:28 Nose looks a bit stubby for me, but its good

help 2020-12-23 02:15:17 <@!270017070635286530> this is the conv engine i use, motor keybinds are anything, preferably something you wont press (i use page down). Conv can ***NOT*** weld with *anything* **but** the motor, so place a wedge under it or whatever. The half wedges on top can weld to anything, as long as it doesnt weld to anything thats locking. Finally, you need space, the conv engine needs space, so if youre using motor lock, make sure theres and open area so the conv can sit in it, other parts dont need space since they dont move.

creations-chat 2021-02-20 21:23:08 Honestly, the PCC has *extremely* high expectations. If you post a creation and its called "shit", take it, don't be butthurt over honest opinions. And if you think it's rude or not constructive, so be it. Don't expect no commentary when you post something regardless of whether or not its bad. It's simple, if people think your build is shit, most likely it is *if they have valid proof or evidence supporting why they don't like it*, other than that, **don't be butthurt when someone calls your creation shit**.

creations-chat 2021-02-21 19:59:48 The design is.. *questionable*, the teeth look kind of ugly and so do the large missiles, it looks big, proportionate, rather blocky. Wing shape is odd, it looks like it wants to be a delta wing but it was melted, canopy and fuselage dont compliment each other, as in they dont blend or contour well, the "spine" of the plane is too flat and could use some angling towards the rear. Overall, the design and general shape could use some work, if not a whole restart. Sorry if it sounded a bit harsh, I had no intention of any harshness.

creations-chat 2021-03-27 19:41:24 Simple, it ruins the overall look. However there are some cases where exposed motor lock is hidden better than others and it generally comes down to preference
creations-chat 2021-03-27 19:43:26 To be fair, your build does have an exposed tower, one that the Su-25 (assuming it has a tower) hides rather well. And whats not to understand about preference?
