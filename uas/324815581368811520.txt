creations-chat 2020-04-11 13:24:09 Embraer EMB 120 Brasilia, operated by British Airways. I am very well aware that there would be the text "British Airways" and its ribbon logo on the fuselage near the nose, but the fuselage was built entirely out of half blocks and half wedges, which didn't allow me to add text.

creations-chat 2020-04-11 13:54:15 Props are a bit small for my liking but I’ll probably figure out something. Tried prop blades but they were too chonky.

bot-central 2020-09-25 05:57:16 -mapsuggest Adding onto Redjay’s suggestion above, I’d like to suggest that the new paved roads run through diverse terrains with a few landmarks (like a random lookout platform/bus stop/petrol station) on the way. 

For instance a two-lane road would run from a town/city, passing through a plain or desert before snaking through a snowy mountain range. 

Or perhaps a circular motorway would run across a strait on a large suspension bridge between two islands and a ravine (which already exists in a way) on a very high bridge, with multiple exits at important spots (e.g. spawn, airports, ports, cities/towns), with some coastal sections offering a lovely view of the sunset over the ocean, rays of golden light shining in between the palm trees.

This would encourage actual exploration and allow for maximum possibilities while playing with land vehicles like vans, lorries and even buses, which I feel are underrated/not as popular compared with planes and ships in this game.
bug-reports 2020-10-04 08:07:55 Is this just happening to me or are cutters not working for anyone else? I have an excavator which makes use of them (I do not in any way condone shredder bugs nor do I use them, don’t worry), and even with PVP on and/or self-protection off, they do nothing against either my nor others’ builds.

creations-chat 2020-11-11 03:52:27 I treat 1 block as half a metre in all my builds, I feel it’s the closest to 1:1 I can get
creations-chat 2020-11-11 03:53:59 That does make a roblox avatar just 1 metre tall, but they look like toddlers anyway
creations-chat 2020-11-11 03:55:45 Welp, I’m kind of forced to build at my half-metre scale because it’s as narrow as my buses can get without ruining the seat layout.
