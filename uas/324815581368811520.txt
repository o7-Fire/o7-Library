plane-crazy 2020-06-07 05:47:45 Thoughts? Front tyres are too ~~wide~~ chonque to be accurate to the real AEC Regent III, but there isn’t a way to make it weld to the rest of the vehicle without sacrificing the rim text boxes.
plane-crazy 2020-05-30 07:45:01 Yes
plane-crazy 2020-05-30 07:44:28 
plane-crazy 2020-05-30 07:44:26 An entire morning of fiddling about and I was just about able to pull a recreation of this off. No interior though, impossible. Any ideas for improved accuracy?
plane-crazy 2020-05-08 02:05:17 Do they even weld to each other and other blocks?
plane-crazy 2020-05-06 11:30:42 I-
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 03:34:53 Where’re my damned oeufs
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 03:34:16 Wat
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 03:33:20 Have you Heil Dir’d your Siegerkranzes today?
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 03:30:44 And retexturable trapdoors
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 03:30:25 I also need brick material
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 03:30:20 I want
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 03:29:56 Custom blocks with nodes to create surfaces with <:thchoink:527880803456122891>
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 03:28:44 Cars are nice
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 03:26:38 *was
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 03:24:44 Pretty impressive
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 03:22:24 Icic
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 03:21:56 Which one is it? I’m a complete chimp when it comes to ships.
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 03:16:01 So it serves as a means to balance your vehicle
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 03:15:50 You can set the mass of the ballast block/beam
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 03:00:24 Pretty epic so far indeed
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 02:59:44 Kk
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 02:59:27 <@456226577798135808> ik, in fact most of my builds are mostly non-functional
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 02:55:49 Massive battleship of sorts?
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 02:49:05 Will fix
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 02:48:49 Thankies, they’re my attempts at recreating these two. The double-decker’s not exactly spot-on now, as you can see.
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 02:42:35 (Museum WIP)
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 02:42:26 Going to build the classic Routemaster next (hopefully), what do you think of my exhibits so far?
plane-crazy 2020-03-21 01:09:28 Perhaps I’ll go with the one above
plane-crazy 2020-03-21 01:09:02 I feel like I want another bi-axle
plane-crazy 2020-03-21 01:08:11 Now I’m torn between these two as well.
plane-crazy 2020-03-21 00:37:17 This wouldn’t be too hard to do
plane-crazy 2020-03-21 00:36:53 Double-deckers in general, really.
plane-crazy 2020-03-21 00:35:18 Nah, I feel trains in this game are just too large. I’ve tried building a metro train before and it was massive.
plane-crazy 2020-03-21 00:34:36 I feel like building this slightly cursed boi, alongside my existing Olympian.
