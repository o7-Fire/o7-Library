creations-chat 2020-11-16 04:03:59 Beginning my DC-3, what do you think so far?
creations-chat 2020-11-16 04:06:54 closer picture, that one's a bit far away
creations-chat 2020-11-16 04:09:10 thank you, first attempt at an airplane with 1:1 scale (I try to make it full scale)
creations-chat 2020-11-29 02:19:27 So I originally Abandonned this B-25 project 5 months ago because it failed and I sucked at building, but I rebuilt it, anything I should add?
creations-chat 2020-11-29 02:21:38 right I was thinking about adding a top turret
creations-chat 2020-12-17 06:13:09 took a while to get the correct pitch, what do you think? I had to correctly pitch two speakers to different pitches to get it correct. Yes, this is the SS Edmund Fitzgerald, her horn was identical to what I've made here
creations-chat 2020-12-17 06:16:16 Look up Edward L. Ryerson to listen to the horn I tried to identicate, they had the same horns, Leslie 300 and 450

creations-chat 2021-02-17 04:49:41 is this smoke ok or is it too much (loud video)
creations-chat 2021-02-18 17:23:30 whats the lightest material?
creations-chat 2021-02-18 17:26:52 confirmed
creations-chat 2021-03-02 16:39:35 first attempt at a motorlocked-cockpit, I havent watched any motorlock tutorials (F4 Phantom)
the-dump 2021-03-15 12:13:59 I just woke up
the-dump 2021-04-09 14:36:43 There’s two elevators on the tail end, as well as a rudder. From what I could see yours doesn’t have those, it might help it fly if you added them
