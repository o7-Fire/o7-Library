Title: space


Outer space with planets like the moon and Mars and other stuff like asteroids and comets so asteroids and comets can fly into the map or go nearby, and I was thinking about you guys adding solar panels so you can power your build if you have a block called the battery and with when you get at an altitude you will start losing heath if you don't stay inside the build and airtight trapdoors and airtight blocks and wedges. so you can do space roleplays realisticly then just going up and walking around and a good one would be if you can add it so when you're in space you will start to float around and if you walk to fast you will get lost in space and you could add like a seat that attaches to a rope of some sort to do spacewalks and other stuff related to space and mabye space suit things you can put on to stay alive in space, and ect.
