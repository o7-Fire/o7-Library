events-chat 2022-02-03 04:02:16 What youve made
events-chat 2022-02-03 04:02:31 you cant use motor 2
events-chat 2022-02-03 04:03:11 Tail gunners
events-chat 2022-02-03 04:03:28 A
events-chat 2022-02-03 04:03:46 Hold up what is the build entirely
events-chat 2022-02-03 04:11:38 Also, this is just a meme submit but if id somehow gets picked i wanna actually try, so far ive got it to be 85% stable with a top speed of 284, however strafing is weird and causes it to go mach speeds, and obv i havent set the guns up at all yet, plus i still need some form of forced ascent/descent, the idea is for it to come up to the side of the bombers being a broad sider. *this was gonna be a double bubble airship but thanks to shitty device 500+ blocks causes vehicle lag and its already up to 404
events-chat 2022-02-03 04:13:36 Technically speaking blips are just big plens

creations-chat 2022-02-10 17:44:57 Bruh feedback can also be what to add to it and srsly it seems pointless that your not allowed to show unfinished builds, if thats the case this should be #completed builds not <#384025409945337856>
creations-chat 2022-02-10 17:47:05 Then why is it creations and creations feedback instead of finished builds and unfished builds? Makes a lot more sense that way, and again srsly a warn for a fucking WIP


How the fuck is creations and creations feedback less complicated than finished builds and unfished builds
creations-chat 2022-02-10 17:57:44 Bro literally creations and creations feedback sound like post your build here and then talk about it there not completed builds here and WIPS there how the fuck does a warn for a WIP even make any sense its literally somebody showing a build before its finished so people could give ideas
Absolute bullshit
creations-chat 2022-02-10 18:09:18 Peabrain translation ***just for you***:
Creations sounds like "post your builds here" and creations feedback sounds like "discuss builds here" as opposed to in actuallity creations is for finished and feedback is for unfinished. Im argueing as to why it cant be more clarified upfront and be called completed builds and uncompleted builds

Literally only 10% of people look at that shit
creations-chat 2022-02-10 18:12:28 Still should still be more clear about the way it is
I dont know how many times i have to say the channels make it sound like it works a different way than it does
DUDE I KNOW HOW CHANNELS WORK IM SAYING THESE TWO IN PARTICULAR DONT SOUND TO BE THE WAY THEY ARE
creations-chat 2022-02-10 18:15:26 yall are so fucking blind i swear to god this isnt even about my warn anymore im trying to say that the channels based off of name are different than they actually work
EASE OF USE EXISTS PEOPLE
creations-chat 2022-02-10 18:19:26 Dude its not the creations part holy shit can you not read FEEDBACK indicates to me that its meant to DISCUSS, and since it is another channel with FEEDBACK added to the name of the other channel its made for, it would make sense to assume the first channel is for posting said builds COMPLETE OR NOT
creations-chat 2022-02-10 18:22:03 Some of the thickest fucking skulls ive ever seen. Literally never seen a crowd so unable to comprehend what im actually saying and instead bending it into a fucking pretzel, fuck all of you.
