creations-chat 2021-11-27 01:10:52 try to streamline the rotor connection thingy by placing it lower and make the engine a bit shorter and also fix the tail rotor
creations-chat 2021-11-29 03:22:56 you forgot the elevators are angled downward and the wing angle is wrong (the no subtle upward angle in the first section)
creations-chat 2021-11-29 03:26:03 the bow doesnt go downwards and the bridge is blocky

creations-chat 2021-12-01 02:24:29 is it just me or do their wings look like from a yak 45 (competitor to mig 29 and su 27) i mean the left one except for  the engine placement  or i might be wrong it might from a yak 38 anyways its confusing
bug-reports 2021-12-01 02:34:08 its a floating point issue rickje139 can remedy it by using double precision floating point numbers
bug-reports 2021-12-01 02:35:26 if rickje139 is using double precision floats then maybe there's no fix
creations-chat 2021-12-01 23:56:09 no it gave me an exe i tried it in a vm and it was ransomware

creations-chat 2021-12-02 01:44:17 the trick to make a jet is to combine hover drives with rocket spam and maybe a few conveyor engines running at 10 speed
creations-chat 2021-12-02 02:06:28 its bad since the cockpit is open and the propeller looks like from an i 16 or a ki 27 since only 2 blades also im reffering to late war a5m

creations-chat 2022-04-21 03:02:58 is my camo crap
creations-chat 2022-04-21 03:04:40 making it smooth requires me to rebuild the wing structure since i made it with many pieces of wing panels that vary in size also what else do i improve
creations-chat 2022-04-21 03:08:10 i think the cockpit is a bit blocky especially the area between the front and the top
creations-chat 2022-04-21 03:09:54 no i mean the one on the left
creations-chat 2022-04-21 03:15:34 this

creations-chat 2022-04-21 03:58:53 at least i made my first non tut build in <#384025409945337856>
creations-chat 2022-04-22 14:53:05 Lol my su 35 (heavily modded tut) is better than that
creations-chat 2022-04-22 14:55:01 Su 35
creations-chat 2022-04-22 14:56:52 I told you it was a modded tut and yes i have a bit of skill isue with very complex stuff like helis and making weirdly shaped intakes n stuff
creations-chat 2022-04-22 14:58:40 Rotors (hard to get right) and delicate weight balacing (very hard to do first try) and the fact that you still need guns which will force you to do step 2 again
creations-chat 2022-04-22 15:00:43 Might turn my su 35 into a mig if i feel like it but the hard part is the rounded intake holes also im not sure if i can build my own mig 29 without wasting time had i just modded my su 35
creations-chat 2022-04-22 15:03:26 Hovers and rockets (theres motor lock thats usually well hidden) and i have angle lock in the engine-fuselage area (hard to notice since the camo hides it tho i think theres a section that isnt well hidden)
creations-chat 2022-04-22 15:05:10 K wait im on mobile and scrennshotting hard also i just repost the pics from an earlier post of mine
creations-chat 2022-04-22 15:11:42 Build mode and the angle lock (notice the gray triangle bit)

creations-chat 2022-04-22 15:26:31 There is (hangs on the intake but meant for the wing fuselage blend) tho its hard to notice if unloaded due to motorlocks nature
creations-chat 2022-04-22 15:28:19 I still havent converted my su to a mig since im busy trolling kids with shredders in kamikaze planes
creations-chat 2022-04-22 15:30:01 I use kamikaze planes to bait them

bug-reports 2022-04-30 08:47:39 I think thats due to attempting to simplify the physics

creations-chat 2022-05-12 06:02:32 idk how to angle lock (is it motorlocking angled blocks) then i got the hang of it (i use it for wing transitions)
creations-chat 2022-05-13 11:25:58 should i add feathering for my propellers (for helicoompter)
