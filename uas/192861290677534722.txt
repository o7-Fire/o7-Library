plane-crazy 2020-06-23 00:28:39 <#529858892075761694> whats the damage of adding more save slots? personally i think that there should be a gui that adds a new slot every time a person makes a new save for their creation
plane-crazy 2020-06-22 05:54:33 oofer plane got sucked into one of the floating islands engines
plane-crazy 2020-06-21 21:08:27 rick hasnt been willing to say "fixed motors" in a long time because he gets memed every time he does
plane-crazy 2020-05-11 21:13:02 AAAA we've been waiting 1 and a half years for logic gates and sensors
plane-crazy 2020-05-10 08:38:16 every little bit of it served a purpose, none of it went to aesthetic, yet it still managed to look (no better word for it, sorry) epic
plane-crazy 2020-05-10 08:37:35 god i miss it
plane-crazy 2020-05-10 08:37:28 it even had recoil supression
plane-crazy 2020-05-10 08:37:16 but you wouldnt understand how awesome my suspension cannon looked while loading and firing
plane-crazy 2020-05-10 08:36:57 its a cool replica though
plane-crazy 2020-05-10 08:36:44 thats barely a cannon
plane-crazy 2020-05-10 08:36:01 im pretty sure i posted a couple pictures here
plane-crazy 2020-05-10 08:35:43 my cannon took up my entire plot
plane-crazy 2020-05-10 08:33:46 but rickje made an update which made it crash every time it loaded in
plane-crazy 2020-05-10 08:33:26 it was huge and could launch EXTREMELY heavy objects, and look completely badass
plane-crazy 2020-05-10 08:33:02 i should reattempt my suspension gun thing
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 23:36:25 uboats were cool because they were boats but underwater
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 23:36:07 whale lookin ass
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 23:36:03 modern submarines look dumb
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 23:35:31 has anybody made a german uboat yet? <:Thonk:509498568982134816>

plane-crazy 2020-04-16 19:39:45 you guys will be jealous
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 19:39:38 it works so well
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 19:39:37 i just created the best car ever
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 00:00:15 a plane that looks exactly like a regular plane, but it flies backwards
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 00:00:00 i feel like making a fucked up plane
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 19:11:40 no engines anywhere
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 19:11:32 oh yeah did i tell you guys that i got the egg using a catapult and glider?
plane-crazy 2020-03-28 03:53:33 https://gyazo.com/9e72d558a02912e6b1ade6d8f36e5db5
plane-crazy 2020-03-27 07:57:55 my noobcopter flies by rotating its propellers, sorta
plane-crazy 2020-03-27 07:57:34 seems pretty neat
plane-crazy 2020-03-27 07:55:52 how is a platform a plane
plane-crazy 2020-03-27 07:55:18 there should be a contest of who can lift the most weight using a plane
plane-crazy 2020-03-27 04:10:40 he skips leg day
plane-crazy 2020-03-27 04:10:05 now imagine that the wings are his arms
plane-crazy 2020-03-27 04:09:58 noob plane
plane-crazy 2020-03-27 04:09:49 
plane-crazy 2020-03-26 02:35:23 why have an aircraft carrier version when you can have a warm, loving noob copter
plane-crazy 2020-03-26 02:34:46 this is her
plane-crazy 2020-03-26 02:34:43 https://gyazo.com/6ca5a8ee5763083e0e4d86d10bc4ff83
plane-crazy 2020-03-26 02:33:24 'twasnt a plane
plane-crazy 2020-03-26 02:31:52 he was born that way, dont bully him
plane-crazy 2020-03-26 02:31:10 Behold: my masterpiece https://gyazo.com/ed5ffb7b9aae6bb4a7e8d8c3fc5fef5b
plane-crazy 2020-03-16 03:58:00 BIG wings
plane-crazy 2020-03-16 03:57:58 just, basically nothing but wings
plane-crazy 2020-03-16 03:57:53 glider
plane-crazy 2020-03-16 03:55:47 yeah
plane-crazy 2020-03-16 03:55:30 use what
plane-crazy 2020-03-16 03:53:18 why are motors the bane of rick's existance
plane-crazy 2020-03-16 03:53:00 but i need it locked
plane-crazy 2020-03-16 03:52:47 why does this happen?
plane-crazy 2020-03-15 23:54:34 how do you weld 2 blocks together so that they stick?
plane-crazy 2020-03-15 04:20:17 is there a way to make 2 parts weld to eachother?
plane-crazy 2020-03-02 23:58:15 ok boomer
plane-crazy 2020-03-02 23:57:13 they only need to be large enough to blow up a torpedo, not an entire ship
plane-crazy 2020-03-02 23:57:00 therye small enough
plane-crazy 2020-03-02 23:56:58 so just add more anti-torps
plane-crazy 2020-03-02 23:56:25 even though the reason that the original torpedos would be big is to carry enough explosives?
plane-crazy 2020-03-02 23:56:05 so you're suggesting having torpedos that are small and use those against the aircraft carrier?
plane-crazy 2020-03-02 23:53:21 how would that work
plane-crazy 2020-03-02 23:52:35 yes, small torpedos that go toward the torpedo and blow up
plane-crazy 2020-03-02 23:51:44 torpedos move a lot slower, so its easy to have anti-torpedos
plane-crazy 2020-03-02 23:50:57 theyre in an aircraft carrier
plane-crazy 2020-03-02 23:50:49 thats why planes arent just in the water normally
plane-crazy 2020-03-02 23:50:38 yes
plane-crazy 2020-03-02 23:49:49 thats why the aircraft carrier does
plane-crazy 2020-03-02 23:49:44 yes
plane-crazy 2020-03-02 23:48:16 bruh if aircraft carriers are so afraid of missiles, just put the entire aircraft carrier underwater and have them resurface when they need to launch planes
plane-crazy 2020-02-29 19:44:17 theres and, or, xor, nor, and another one that im forgetting
plane-crazy 2020-02-29 19:44:00 just look them up, the internet is good at explaining things
plane-crazy 2020-02-29 19:43:50 theyre sorta hard to explain
plane-crazy 2020-02-29 19:40:36 still pretty cool at least
plane-crazy 2020-02-29 19:38:37 damn
plane-crazy 2020-02-29 19:38:31 no wait its a block
plane-crazy 2020-02-29 19:38:16 <#529858892075761694> DID RICKJE FINALLY ADD LOGIC GATES SO YOU CAN PROGRAM YOUR CREATIONS TO HOVER? :D
plane-crazy 2020-02-06 06:01:19 it aint spam tho, it cool
plane-crazy 2020-02-06 06:01:11 the spam filter memed it
plane-crazy 2020-02-06 06:01:02 aw
plane-crazy 2020-02-06 06:00:58 i may or may not get automatically memed but my friend just showed me something cool and now i gotta show you guys
plane-crazy 2020-02-06 05:46:24 you know things are fucking up when you relate to a bill wurtz song.
plane-crazy 2020-01-23 20:30:27 I've been failing 3 classes for the entire semester and today(the last final test day) I've passed them all
plane-crazy 2020-01-23 20:29:56 I have mastered the art of procrastination
plane-crazy 2020-01-20 07:43:45 if theres only like 1 guy or if theres like 30 separate dudes just watching 3 people talk to eachother
plane-crazy 2020-01-20 07:43:27 also i wonder how many people just lurk
plane-crazy 2020-01-20 07:43:04 oh yeah furries first
plane-crazy 2020-01-20 07:42:47 we need a purge
plane-crazy 2020-01-20 07:42:45 there are too many weebs here
plane-crazy 2020-01-20 07:41:20 but honestly not my problem
plane-crazy 2020-01-20 07:41:14 im sorry that you have no empathy for people who have achieved more than you
plane-crazy 2020-01-20 07:40:51 both my warp drive and super sonic engineer ranks are gone
plane-crazy 2020-01-20 07:40:39 i just looked at my roles
plane-crazy 2020-01-20 07:40:34 nooo!
plane-crazy 2020-01-20 07:39:31 this is the first PFP ive ever had
plane-crazy 2020-01-20 07:39:23 i havent changed my PFP in 3/4 years
plane-crazy 2020-01-20 07:38:51 hUh
plane-crazy 2020-01-20 07:38:33 your mom
plane-crazy 2020-01-19 02:25:16 oh
plane-crazy 2020-01-19 02:24:40 btw has nobody ever looked at this before:
plane-crazy 2020-01-19 02:20:07 if you look in the background, you will see something
plane-crazy 2020-01-19 02:19:57 also i broke again with a bonus of something else
plane-crazy 2020-01-19 02:19:41 im at the deadlands
plane-crazy 2020-01-19 02:15:07 
plane-crazy 2020-01-19 02:15:04 i broke something
plane-crazy 2020-01-13 22:35:59 The explosion in creativity from that would just be insane
plane-crazy 2020-01-13 22:35:48 Sensors and logic gates would be a god send
plane-crazy 2020-01-13 22:32:52 For rickjes birthday he should add logic gates <:pain:644301805534183464>
plane-crazy 2020-01-13 17:23:03 fun fact: 😃 will never convey as much emotion as :D
plane-crazy 2020-01-10 06:39:55 god i really wish there were non-lifting wing panels so we could have the aerodynamic effects of wings, but not the center of lift shifting
plane-crazy 2020-01-03 03:34:45 this is fun
plane-crazy 2020-01-03 03:34:44 the cat just attacked my foot
plane-crazy 2020-01-03 03:34:25 yeah its time to get funky
plane-crazy 2020-01-03 03:34:11 shut up loser this is funky time
plane-crazy 2020-01-03 03:33:54 very, very, very slowly though
plane-crazy 2020-01-03 03:33:31 just checked, my heart is in fact still beating
plane-crazy 2020-01-03 03:33:10 ago
plane-crazy 2020-01-03 03:33:09 i didnt feel like this 3 minutes
plane-crazy 2020-01-03 03:33:02 this is funky
plane-crazy 2020-01-03 03:33:00 and discord looks 3D
plane-crazy 2020-01-03 03:32:53 whenever i turn my head, it feels like my consciousness is being dragged behind
plane-crazy 2020-01-03 03:32:40 the longer i stay awake, the less real things feel
plane-crazy 2020-01-01 07:20:20 idk why, but it was just such a great book
plane-crazy 2020-01-01 07:20:09 the only book that ive read in english class that ive really liked reading is the great gatsby
plane-crazy 2019-12-27 08:38:45 <@!372146456770904066> (x+1)^x - x^(x+1)
plane-crazy 2019-12-27 08:35:06 i love how baddly im breaking desmos
plane-crazy 2019-12-18 06:54:02 prepare to die
plane-crazy 2019-12-18 06:53:51 ah, it was you
plane-crazy 2019-12-18 06:53:36 where do you think im getting inspiration from, person who just ghost pinged me?
plane-crazy 2019-12-18 06:49:05 fun times
plane-crazy 2019-12-18 06:49:03 nobody has made a rocket plane before
plane-crazy 2019-12-18 06:48:57 and my teacher said that he trusts me enough that he would be willing to let me make a rocket plane next semester
plane-crazy 2019-12-18 06:48:39 i finished building a plane and now im moving on to rockets
plane-crazy 2019-12-18 06:48:27 we build planes
plane-crazy 2019-12-18 06:48:23 fun fact: in my physics class, we dont learn physics
plane-crazy 2019-12-18 06:47:35 just a reminder that birdwatching goes both ways
plane-crazy 2019-12-13 05:16:36 but im proud of myself for thinking of that
plane-crazy 2019-12-13 05:16:22 well of course a chemistry teacher is
plane-crazy 2019-12-13 05:15:46 and actually writing things correctly
plane-crazy 2019-12-13 05:15:41 my teacher is strict about showing work
plane-crazy 2019-12-13 05:15:09 i did all that stuff 3 years ago
plane-crazy 2019-12-13 05:15:02 yeah
plane-crazy 2019-12-13 05:14:49 ez
plane-crazy 2019-12-13 05:14:48 4^2 is 16
plane-crazy 2019-12-13 05:14:37 ez pz pp squeezy
plane-crazy 2019-12-13 05:14:31 2 times 2 is 4
plane-crazy 2019-12-13 05:14:27 1+1 is 2
plane-crazy 2019-12-13 05:14:24 algebra is easy
plane-crazy 2019-12-13 05:13:28 mean while normal pre calculus is review of stuff first semester and then pre calculus second sem
plane-crazy 2019-12-13 05:13:04 its pre calculus and then actual calculus next semester
plane-crazy 2019-12-13 05:12:41 so the teacher should have seen that someone would have done this some day
plane-crazy 2019-12-13 05:12:31 im in advanced pre calculus, which is all about infinites
plane-crazy 2019-12-13 05:12:19 not as cool as doing (-inf, -inf) and stuff
plane-crazy 2019-12-13 05:12:01 yeah graphing calculators psh
plane-crazy 2019-12-13 05:10:18 get nae naed teacher
plane-crazy 2019-12-13 05:10:14 during todays math test, the teacher made us label the axis' for the graphs and i set them to infinity and negative infinity so that even though it was a curved line, i only had to make a linear line from (-inf,-inf) to (+inf, +inf).
plane-crazy 2019-12-11 05:48:50 <@!322970944303923200> remember in 1985 when back to the future thought that we would have hoverboards in 2014
plane-crazy 2019-12-11 05:45:46 like think about it, you got the surveillance police state of china, the united states and other European places with cool gadgets that allow you to access the entirety of human knowledge but also an insanely huge wealth gap, and Russia where there are secret military ops and stuff.
plane-crazy 2019-12-11 05:45:24 the most accurate depictions of the modern world made in the 1900s were novels about dystopias
plane-crazy 2019-12-11 05:44:52 bruh you know what i just realized
plane-crazy 2019-12-10 04:39:58 and then they commit genocide and that just ruins it all
plane-crazy 2019-12-10 04:39:46 probably contacted aliens idk
plane-crazy 2019-12-10 04:39:42 big insentive for science
plane-crazy 2019-12-10 04:39:28 cool uniforms
plane-crazy 2019-12-10 04:39:23 flying tanks
plane-crazy 2019-12-10 04:39:18 tanks with naval armaments
plane-crazy 2019-12-10 04:39:10 but they had their positives
plane-crazy 2019-12-10 04:39:03 of course the german national socialists were bad
plane-crazy 2019-12-10 04:38:45 bruh i just said that <@!437078588701933568>
plane-crazy 2019-12-10 04:38:24 you gotta admit, the germans had style
plane-crazy 2019-12-10 04:38:03 thats not good
plane-crazy 2019-12-10 04:38:00 now imagine genocide
plane-crazy 2019-12-10 04:37:53 thats fuckin cool
plane-crazy 2019-12-10 04:37:50 like, imagine designing a tank that can house naval armaments
plane-crazy 2019-12-10 04:37:31 they were cool, but definitely not good
plane-crazy 2019-12-10 04:36:01 oh god
plane-crazy 2019-12-10 04:35:54 no way to test it
plane-crazy 2019-12-10 04:35:46 just get your friend to build a church and hide their name and then you build something against the rules then boom
plane-crazy 2019-12-10 04:35:21 actually yeah that could prove it possibly
plane-crazy 2019-12-10 04:34:48 you cant
plane-crazy 2019-12-10 04:34:46 loser
plane-crazy 2019-12-10 04:34:45 prove it
plane-crazy 2019-12-10 04:34:39 that is a good idea
plane-crazy 2019-12-10 04:33:59 OOF
plane-crazy 2019-12-10 04:33:50 intelligent
plane-crazy 2019-12-10 04:33:27 you think a cave man could learn to build a particle collider?
plane-crazy 2019-12-10 04:33:16 yeah but human advancement could slow to a near halt, since there wouldnt be any new fresh brains to grow up used to the absurd amount of information thats required to understand this stuff
plane-crazy 2019-12-10 04:31:46 what is confusing about that question
plane-crazy 2019-12-10 04:31:28 if there was a method to make humans immortal, would babies become illegal, or would the method become illegal? <:Thonk:509498568982134816>
plane-crazy 2019-12-08 23:18:43 <:pogey:651848693842182144>
plane-crazy 2019-12-08 23:15:05 blocks add lag so yes
plane-crazy 2019-12-08 23:07:29 is it rude to grab a dog by its snoot to prevent it from licking you
plane-crazy 2019-12-06 01:12:44 anarchist logic: If we remove all laws, the crime rate would be 0%
plane-crazy 2019-12-05 18:14:27 I think, I haven't watched it yet
plane-crazy 2019-12-05 18:14:15 And YouTube actually addressed the fact that the last one sucked
plane-crazy 2019-12-05 18:13:57 YAAAH it's rewind time
plane-crazy 2019-12-05 17:10:16 <:pain:644301805534183464>
plane-crazy 2019-12-05 17:07:55 <:bruhaps:646045387911725106>
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 17:38:31 What's difficult about making anti-mouse-guided-missiles compared to just normal anti-missiles
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 17:29:53 Or maybe a flak cannon
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 17:29:49 Or jist rifle
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 17:29:45 Cool, I'll make a cutter machine gun
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 17:29:21 Aighty
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 17:28:16 If so, thst would be op as all fuck
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 17:28:09 Wait, do cutters go through blocks instead of just stopping
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 17:27:34 <:thconking:535171057649188865>
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 17:27:03 Cutters seem like they would break a single block and then just stop the plane in it's tracks
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 17:26:15 Oh, I misread
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 17:26:03 Why are you telling me to use it then noob
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 17:25:23 Noob
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 17:25:22 That's what I use
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 17:25:11 Ni, he server is laggy
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 17:24:49 Last time I tried hitting a plane mid air using a home made missile, the missile blows up and the plane gets away unscathed
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 17:23:48 What
plane-crazy 2019-12-03 17:27:49 Chat fixed
plane-crazy 2019-12-03 17:24:04 Can't say unfamily-friendly things if you can't say anything at all!
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 06:29:38 watching a cat play with a toy, toy gets stuck to his paw, he YEETS the fuck out of the toy and it nearly hits me.
plane-crazy 2019-11-30 09:13:06 Rickje: "Update: Fixed motors"
Motors: https://gyazo.com/b21b36e760da0ba8a067bc80a71a4ba2
plane-crazy 2019-11-27 21:36:59 basically the sigmoid function would look like this:
(1/1+math.exp((-x/6)*range/2+range/2))*lift range
plane-crazy 2019-11-27 21:33:36 rick, i recommend using a sigmoid function for lift so that when planes go like 14 billion studs per second the wings dont completely destroy the plane
plane-crazy 2019-11-27 21:32:52 oh, dang
plane-crazy 2019-11-27 21:32:47 i can use magnets as a plane catapult
plane-crazy 2019-11-27 21:32:05 <@!217336009455566848> the wing flinging issue thats existed ever since the beginning, or was there a new one?
plane-crazy 2019-11-26 06:40:05 or we will just piss you off

plane-crazy 2019-10-15 23:13:04 no because youre not russian

plane-crazy 2019-10-15 14:54:38 It's not a problem, it's an equation
plane-crazy 2019-10-15 14:54:24 That might work
plane-crazy 2019-10-15 14:54:20 Precalc?
plane-crazy 2019-10-15 14:53:57 Hey, who here is in calculus
plane-crazy 2019-10-12 20:11:40 the first thing i ever made was a vtol
plane-crazy 2019-10-12 20:11:04 
plane-crazy 2019-10-12 16:26:23 i designed like a minigun, shot like 40 balls within 5 seconds, could probably be useful for taking down planes since it has a lot of spewage, whatever its called
plane-crazy 2019-10-12 16:25:24 magnet cannons dont have recoil because things and stuff
plane-crazy 2019-10-12 16:24:04 now magnet cannons can be useful for something
plane-crazy 2019-10-12 16:23:52 <#529858892075761694> o heck yeah
plane-crazy 2019-10-12 02:24:04

plane-crazy 2019-10-11 05:42:42 doesnt mean you have to announce that you do
plane-crazy 2019-10-11 05:42:33 yes, theres always someone who already know
plane-crazy 2019-10-11 05:41:37 fun fact; by far the largest portion of contraband brought to airports intended to be brought on planes, are fruits and vegetables that the united states has banned

plane-crazy 2019-10-10 16:59:07 Logic gates first
plane-crazy 2019-10-10 16:55:32 Have you spoken with Joe recently?
plane-crazy 2019-10-10 16:55:23 Also I have another question
plane-crazy 2019-10-10 16:54:53 We've been asking for nearly a year at this point
plane-crazy 2019-10-10 16:54:43 Any idea when we get **logic gates**
plane-crazy 2019-10-10 16:54:26 You know what I'm about to ask
plane-crazy 2019-10-10 16:54:13 Rick
plane-crazy 2019-10-09 19:18:05 Satellite
plane-crazy 2019-10-09 18:46:29 Hello ######s
plane-crazy 2019-10-09 17:41:25 Swear to gosh
plane-crazy 2019-10-09 15:15:56 Fuck bitches, get money
plane-crazy 2019-10-09 15:15:06 Banning true minimodding is good, like I was in this server that actively encouraged minimodders so when I was having a conversation with this person I had like 3 guys warning me for "swearing" when I said things like "poop" and "stupid" and GOD FORBID you say "crap"
plane-crazy 2019-10-09 15:12:53 And if I wanted to be a mod, I would apply for them, but I just like being here to talk to people, the mods that are here already do a fantastic job
plane-crazy 2019-10-09 15:10:57 So therefore, me no mini mod
plane-crazy 2019-10-09 15:10:49 I don't want to be a mod, and I don't tattle on tiny things
plane-crazy 2019-10-09 15:10:34 Minimods are people who want to be moderators and who are overly strict about everything
plane-crazy 2019-10-09 15:09:10 Bruh I'm trying to make sure the discord is safe by making sure this underage guy gets banned
plane-crazy 2019-10-09 15:07:41 So he would still be illegal in a week
plane-crazy 2019-10-09 15:07:27 You know how Twitter bans people who change their birthday to be above 13? Discord does the same because he broke TOS
plane-crazy 2019-10-09 15:06:52 I mean he's still illegal
plane-crazy 2019-10-09 15:06:13 He's 12 years old and the Discord can delete this server if we have 12 year olds here
plane-crazy 2019-10-09 15:05:50 <@327499289595084800> you gonna ban him or nah?
plane-crazy 2019-10-09 15:04:31 He is breaking discord TOS just by owning an account and we can't have that
plane-crazy 2019-10-09 15:04:03 Yeah who cares Bout that
plane-crazy 2019-10-09 15:03:22 Because of they found that we allowed 12 year olds here, then we would get in big trouble
plane-crazy 2019-10-09 15:03:00 Discord admins would
plane-crazy 2019-10-09 15:02:51 Now begone
plane-crazy 2019-10-09 15:02:46 So thank you for endangering the discord for illegally being here
plane-crazy 2019-10-09 15:02:25 And we don't want our discord getting deleted over you
plane-crazy 2019-10-09 15:02:05 And today
plane-crazy 2019-10-09 15:01:59 And you were 12 yesterday
plane-crazy 2019-10-09 15:01:52 Yeah
plane-crazy 2019-10-09 15:01:37 <@327499289595084800>
plane-crazy 2019-10-09 15:01:31 Ah so it's still against TOS because it's a legal thing
plane-crazy 2019-10-09 15:00:42 Sounds like something a 12 year old would say
plane-crazy 2019-10-08 17:24:10 We would probably have unicornsz you don't know
plane-crazy 2019-10-08 17:23:19 I wonder what society would be like if girls were real
plane-crazy 2019-10-04 21:21:45 Help liberals are following me
plane-crazy 2019-09-30 16:13:29 Help
plane-crazy 2019-09-30 16:13:26 That means winter is coming
plane-crazy 2019-09-30 16:13:21 The mountain near my city has snow on top of it
plane-crazy 2019-09-30 15:57:39 That would be nice
plane-crazy 2019-09-30 15:57:32 Why don't bullys beat up the people that chew gum with their mouth open
plane-crazy 2019-09-30 14:46:17 Thanks
plane-crazy 2019-09-30 14:46:05 Bruh this is <#384021699466756107> move to <#497142796961054721>
plane-crazy 2019-09-30 14:44:42 SCPF games are just less successful simulator games ***change my mind***
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 18:51:50 I think they made buying people illegal like 170 years ago
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 18:49:54 <#490306593242611742> I wonder how compressed I can make data
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 19:23:44 The only reason you would have upwards-lifting tail wings is if your center of mass is behind your main wings, which is a HORRIBLE design
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 19:22:45 The tail wings are actively pushing the tail down, because the main wings are usually behind the center of mass, meaning you need reverse lifting wings behind the main wings to push the center of lift foreward
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 19:22:03 It doesnt
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 19:21:28 Reverse lifting tail wings push the tail down,
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 19:21:00 Well you didn't take a class in aeronautics
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 19:20:38 That's how planes can keep their main lifting wings so far back
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 19:20:20 Real life planes use reverse-lifting wing panels on the tail wings
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 19:19:48 Tail wings
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 19:19:15 And I'm assuming that the wings cause an upward loft no matter what way they are facing, which is why I'm suggesting reverse-lifting wingpanels
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 19:18:17 Or I will get angry
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 19:18:12 Rickje, add non-lifting and reverse-lifting wing panels
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 18:10:42 I would also play plane crazy if rickje added a motor function that makes the motor always point upwards
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 18:09:53 Send me your tears
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 18:09:48 Prove it
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 18:09:32 I'm not gonna play plane crazy until he adds logic gates or if he gets sad
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 18:09:14 Confirmee
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 17:48:40 Yeah, carl-bot is a prick, he downvotes literally every suggestion
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 17:47:14 Take the logic gates challenge!
Bully Rickje into adding logic gates to plane crazy before 2020
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 17:46:21 Oof

plane-crazy 2019-09-26 16:09:56 I just heard that tomorrow's theme is camo
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 16:07:55 Oh, the reason is because it's spirit week, meaning every day we ~~stray further from god~~ wear a different style of clothes
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 16:06:29 Help
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 16:06:28 This dude is wearing a shirt that's showing way too much
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 16:06:08 That's why I'm scared
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 16:06:03 Idk
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 16:05:54 I'm scared
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 16:05:51 Help
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 16:05:49 Roughly 1/2 of my school is wearing pink
plane-crazy 2019-09-25 19:49:43 Probably some dumbass pulled it for shits and giggles
plane-crazy 2019-09-25 19:49:24 And this time, no idea
plane-crazy 2019-09-25 19:49:19 The next time apparently volleyball hit a detector
plane-crazy 2019-09-25 19:49:05 Once by one of the insane kids
plane-crazy 2019-09-25 19:48:56 The fire alarm has been pulled 3 times today
plane-crazy 2019-09-25 19:09:05 Yeah
plane-crazy 2019-09-25 19:08:40 We're building remote controlled planes
plane-crazy 2019-09-25 19:08:30 Nope
plane-crazy 2019-09-25 19:08:28 So I'm taking physics class rn, and I was expecting big equations and complex questions and stuff
plane-crazy 2019-09-25 17:16:59 gat
plane-crazy 2019-09-25 17:16:35 They're just inverted dudes
plane-crazy 2019-09-25 17:16:28 Fellas, be honest, girls aren't real
plane-crazy 2019-09-25 17:15:14 I don't mean to get political or anything, but is water wet?
plane-crazy 2019-09-25 16:19:38 You are fuck. Be respected woman.
plane-crazy 2019-09-25 16:09:13 Idk
plane-crazy 2019-09-25 16:08:25 So there's a deaf girl in a different discord and she can't write English very well
plane-crazy 2019-09-25 15:10:52 I don't go to funerals, because why would I attend someone's funeral of they don't attend mine?
plane-crazy 2019-09-20 20:39:52 How does a mod not know the group exists
plane-crazy 2019-09-20 17:18:28 Phantom Forces is just Stay-At-Home Nerf war simulator

plane-crazy 2019-09-19 20:26:52 Area-51 massacre happens tomorrow, don't miss out! 👽 👌
plane-crazy 2019-09-19 20:19:29 That's a comma
plane-crazy 2019-09-19 20:18:39 Political question: is rickje thicc or flatt
plane-crazy 2019-09-19 17:20:24 Scott manly is a pretty epic gamer
plane-crazy 2019-09-19 17:13:51 Oh ok
plane-crazy 2019-09-19 17:13:21 I don't want furry sauce thanks
plane-crazy 2019-09-19 17:13:10 What
plane-crazy 2019-09-19 17:13:05 Because there's a better place for anime and furry content: DMs
plane-crazy 2019-09-19 17:12:45 There's a reason there anime and furry content is illegal in all of the servers that I'm an HR in
plane-crazy 2019-09-19 17:12:13 Furries have stupid
plane-crazy 2019-09-19 14:59:11 Sounds pretty fucky tbh
plane-crazy 2019-09-19 14:58:24 Don't have to sacrifice lift for turning
plane-crazy 2019-09-19 14:58:12 And more efficient too
plane-crazy 2019-09-19 14:58:08 Wrong, the propeller in the back provides for better and easier control
plane-crazy 2019-09-19 14:55:52 They have 2 propellers which is a bad design
plane-crazy 2019-09-19 14:55:43 There isn't one
plane-crazy 2019-09-19 14:55:20 Not today saw
plane-crazy 2019-09-19 14:54:54 Like, the collective of grass blades make rope
plane-crazy 2019-09-19 14:54:41 Collective means what the group makes
plane-crazy 2019-09-19 14:54:02 Russian planes are usually ugly as well
plane-crazy 2019-09-19 14:53:28 Looks pretty hot
plane-crazy 2019-09-19 03:32:03 a skull of someone who had bone cancer. interesting but looks like it would have been EXTREMELY painful: ||https://www.reddit.com/r/interestingasfuck/comments/d64wje/bone_cancer_enveloping_a_human_skull/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share||
plane-crazy 2019-09-19 03:31:40 well i guess im going to have to send my stuff here
plane-crazy 2019-09-19 03:31:24 it was so nice
plane-crazy 2019-09-19 03:31:22 why
plane-crazy 2019-09-19 03:31:13 bruh what happened to #general
plane-crazy 2019-09-18 19:24:47 No, unlike most millennials I only use homemade seratonin
plane-crazy 2019-09-18 19:24:00 But I'm not showing any of you because I patented it and I don't want you guys making it without paying me
plane-crazy 2019-09-18 19:23:41 Happiness
plane-crazy 2019-09-18 19:23:05 Ye
plane-crazy 2019-09-18 19:22:58 But make it over 3x as large as a normal aircraft carrier
plane-crazy 2019-09-18 19:22:40 Because you make fully working ice sculptures of things you can't afford
plane-crazy 2019-09-18 19:22:17 Did you know that the British were planning on making an aircraft carrier out of an iceberg because they were poor at the time
plane-crazy 2019-09-18 19:05:09 
plane-crazy 2019-09-18 18:39:56 My dad owns my mom
plane-crazy 2019-09-18 18:39:40 My dad owns Microsoft and he will ban you in real life if you don't stop bulying mee
plane-crazy 2019-09-18 18:25:48 Bruh moment
plane-crazy 2019-09-18 18:25:20 So friday
plane-crazy 2019-09-18 18:25:05 It's on the 20th
plane-crazy 2019-09-18 18:24:42 Yeah I can't remember the last time Roblox had a problem
plane-crazy 2019-09-18 18:24:29 Good
plane-crazy 2019-09-18 18:21:12 Would you take a look at that tilted tower
plane-crazy 2019-09-18 18:20:33 The area 51 massacre is in 2 days!
plane-crazy 2019-09-17 17:14:41 American football is the entertaining version of football
plane-crazy 2019-09-17 17:14:30 Soccer is British football
plane-crazy 2019-09-17 17:13:38 
plane-crazy 2019-09-17 17:12:09 ***several people are typing***
plane-crazy 2019-09-17 14:35:58 Yeah, Roblox did a good and censored all the OwO cancer variants
plane-crazy 2019-09-17 04:33:32 british people pronounce r as "ah" while americans pronounce it "R", so how do they teach their students to pronounce r
plane-crazy 2019-09-17 04:32:35 yeah
plane-crazy 2019-09-17 04:32:16 or even canadian maybe
plane-crazy 2019-09-17 04:32:07 when non-native english speaking english teachers teach their students how to pronounce english, do they teach them how to pronounce it as British, Scotish, Irish, Australian, or American
plane-crazy 2019-09-16 21:35:31 Imagine how big the creations would be if the plot sizes were twice as big. You could for 2^2 times the amount of stuff in it
plane-crazy 2019-09-16 19:44:48 Interesting how internet culture can cross language barriers
plane-crazy 2019-09-16 19:44:37 I was put into a presumably danish Roblox server and the only words I could recognise were "lol" and "noob"
plane-crazy 2019-09-16 19:16:21 I don't mean to get political or anything, but is a burrito just a Mexican copy of sushi?
plane-crazy 2019-09-16 14:51:22 You can still only use 4 of the sides though
plane-crazy 2019-09-14 01:37:42 now im good
plane-crazy 2019-09-14 01:37:39 my doctor said my heart was fucked up because of how dehydrated it was so i decided to get myself addicted to caffein
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 21:34:43 Why do people go on private servers when there's nothing but 3000 block creations and laggy st*ff
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 21:33:32 So do I but I don't abuse them
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 21:33:02 It's how it works
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 21:32:59 Rick said it was Photoshop so it's true
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 21:32:50 Oh
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 21:32:47 Because I've seen Rick display himself as a fellow intellectual
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 21:32:22 Yes but he was probably ironic
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 21:31:19 I quoted it
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 21:31:16 Wrong
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 21:30:59 Rick, made "OwO" illegal in this server
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 21:30:36 They can be furries but they have to take their "OwO"s to a furry server
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 21:30:18 Jk
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 21:30:15 Sad
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 21:30:13 Ah so I see you're wrong
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 21:30:05 By proving them wrong
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 21:29:56 So I must cleanse the heretics
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 21:29:46 I don't want to be but somebody brought it up
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 21:29:38 Ayyyy
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 21:29:18 Are furries bad
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 21:29:15 Political question
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 21:29:11 Rick
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 21:29:09 Oi
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 21:29:02 Furry very bad
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 21:28:51 Furry bad
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 21:28:03 He only gets mad
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 21:27:58 I already tried that <@238017332872478720>
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 21:27:32 How do I invent die?
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 19:46:50 Girls are a myth created by tampon companies to sell more tampons
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 19:46:19 Because girls aren't real <@414954293448146974>
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 19:46:05 It's not discriminatory
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 19:45:47 Weebs are just people who are bad* <@340543153922768906>
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 19:45:10 Die
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 19:45:09 Weeb furries
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 19:44:47 Destroy it
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 19:44:45 Oh God a furry
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 17:17:40 Rickje should add logic gates
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 17:17:31 Speaking of peak
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:42:46 Can you ban yourself?
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:42:41 Cool
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:29:16 Fonk no thonk
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 18:59:53 But that's why I never build aesthetic things. The prettiest thing I have built is a noob helicopter
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 18:59:23 If he isn't, then oof
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 17:17:20 You asked me to give examples of good libraries, and I said tensor flow and bumpy and so many others
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 17:17:01 The thing you asked me to staye
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 17:16:50 A library
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 17:16:43 Python is superior to most languages
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 17:16:30 He's just getting blasted with reason and he's just saying "??" As if that's helping him
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 17:16:04 It's amazing
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 17:16:02 It has numpy
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 17:15:54 It has tensorflow
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 17:15:45 There's a reason python is famous among machine learning people
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 17:15:28 Python has a lot more libraries, and USEFUL ones
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 17:14:48 And inefficient
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 17:14:46 It's just bad
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 17:14:44 It requires you to do "end" at the end of stacks. It requires "do" instead of "then" and vice versa only depending on function
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 17:13:55 It's not bad, it's AWFUL
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 17:13:29 Because it is
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 17:13:16 Lua's structuring is bad
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 17:12:50 But python, you need to understand, is AMAZINF
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 17:12:39 And python
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 17:12:37 I'm great at lua
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 17:12:33 Believe me
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 17:12:30 Lua is AWFUL
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 17:12:26 I've created all kinds of things with it
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 17:12:18 Python is amazing
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 17:12:04 Python language superior
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 17:04:23 But yes, freshmen in high school. Either walk correctly through high school or delete yourself
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 17:03:11 -senior
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 17:03:09 Thank you
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 17:03:06 Either walk through the halls correctly or die
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 17:02:48 Is anybody here a high school freshman?
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 17:02:01 Cacus
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 16:11:32 <#507673335816126509> (to the one about inverted motor 2s) just turn it around lmao
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 16:09:29 And only 2 more magnets and it teleports
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 16:08:16 It's REALLY easy
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 16:08:11 Yeah, it's not easy
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 15:09:31 All the cool kids are doing it
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 15:09:21 Take the logic gates before 2020 challenge
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 15:09:00 Heeeey Rick
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 15:08:20 Wrong
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 15:06:50 Do water propellers produce *any* thrust out of the water?
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 14:45:12 Maybe you should use your time for something my revolutionary <:WhatWasThat:525319504721608705>
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 14:44:31 I never use those because aesthetics are for STUPIDS
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 14:43:50 You already know what I'm gonna say <:PewPew:532303441293344778>
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 14:43:33 You should make...
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 19:36:09 Oh so he's a bitch?
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 19:35:49 What
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 19:35:37 Hec
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 19:35:35 I'm scared now
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 19:35:06 I've pinged him before, so I shall do it myself
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 19:33:12 You ping him because I have nothing to lose except my existence here
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 19:32:44 Ye
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 19:32:32 Not spam ping of course
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 19:32:11 Should we bully him harder by pinging him?
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 19:31:25 Anyways how much more do we have to bully Richard until he decides that it's better to just add logic gates just to get us to stop bullying him
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 19:27:04 Well, the greatest single thing added to plane crazy. Not better than rockets and blocks but better than almost everything else
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 19:25:27 Logic gates will just be the greatest thing to be added to plane crazy
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 19:25:07 The more freedom/complex things you allow your players to use to create things, the more complex and unique things your players can invent
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 19:23:00 We've been asking for almost a year at this point, we require it
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 19:22:41 >:/
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 19:22:38 We need logic gates
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 19:22:32 We could have made do without them
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 19:21:47 Richard, you get inventor when. You invent logic gates
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 19:20:55 Easy
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 19:20:54 Epic
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 19:20:46 <@339519624968404993> oi how many things do I have to invent to get crazy inventor
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 19:20:11 Aight mk
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 19:20:09 Because I've invented so many things
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 19:19:48 Epic, if I knew about that then I would have claimed crazy inventor
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 19:18:30 Wait is there actually a role called crazy inventor?
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 19:15:01 Ah, so it's either 1 or infinity
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 19:14:31 I know I already have inventor. I'm asking that since I already have inventor, if I invent another thing will I get inventor squared
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 19:13:31 Also <@381263178589536257> could I get inventor squared since I already invented something
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 19:13:04 Make something
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 19:12:59 Too baaaad
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 19:11:38 That's why I bullied Richard into adding a 1x.9 block
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 19:11:21 Yeah, having 2 blocks perfectly flush with each other is bad because it creates a stupid amount of friction
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 16:08:24 I made a mouse-controlled missile, and it's VERY easy to fly, ESPECIALLY for a missile
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 01:49:42 ive used literally everything except cosmetic items that rick has given me and i still havent found a need for a second primary seat
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 01:49:14 whats the point
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 01:49:09 >:/
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 01:48:18 does pilot seat do anything yet or is rick still bad
plane-crazy 2019-09-09 16:06:41 aight
plane-crazy 2019-09-09 16:06:40 because dogs are cool
plane-crazy 2019-09-09 16:06:37 unless its an actual bitch
plane-crazy 2019-09-09 16:06:18 fuck bitches you know, nobody likes a bitch
plane-crazy 2019-09-09 16:06:11 we're allowed to say bitch
plane-crazy 2019-09-09 16:06:08 yeah
plane-crazy 2019-09-09 16:05:33 what
plane-crazy 2019-09-08 17:37:35 its almost as good as logic gates
plane-crazy 2019-09-08 17:37:24 <#529858892075761694> is fucking hot
plane-crazy 2019-09-08 17:34:02 fellas https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lutNECOZFw
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 17:04:45 Invent halls
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 17:04:40 Oh you haven't invented halls yet
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 17:04:24 Loser
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 17:04:22 Well get halls then

plane-crazy 2019-08-28 19:36:43 i have a question
plane-crazy 2019-08-28 08:57:22 what
plane-crazy 2019-08-28 08:56:48 wasnt sure if it was against the rules here, since its kind of on the same level of offensiveness as faggot
plane-crazy 2019-08-28 08:56:23 retard
plane-crazy 2019-08-28 08:56:22 yeah
plane-crazy 2019-08-28 08:55:59 idk if the r word is against the rules here since its kinda derogatory
plane-crazy 2019-08-28 08:55:36 <@456226577798135808> people are throwing around the r word 👀
plane-crazy 2019-08-28 08:55:09 watch your fucking mouth
plane-crazy 2019-08-28 07:33:42 cant be vague like that, that never gives you points in a question

plane-crazy 2019-08-26 20:07:34 was fun
plane-crazy 2019-08-26 20:07:33 to the point where other mods just did it for me
plane-crazy 2019-08-26 20:07:23 also when i was a mod and somebody said "how do i get a rank" i would say "ask a mod" and never give them the rank unless they asked me
plane-crazy 2019-08-26 20:06:16 fun fact: i used to moderate for an LGBT discord because my sister owned it. and when you moderate for the kind of discord prone to trolls, say, an lgbt one, you see some shit
plane-crazy 2019-08-26 20:05:16 i used to think i was gay until i realized that females were h0tter than dudes so yeah
plane-crazy 2019-08-26 20:04:40 pansexual is the definition of not having standards **change my mind**
plane-crazy 2019-08-26 20:04:12 ok lesbian
plane-crazy 2019-08-26 19:52:28 what a horrible time to be alive
plane-crazy 2019-08-26 19:52:22 furry and anime

plane-crazy 2019-08-26 19:51:52 just wear socks and boom, the gay is away
plane-crazy 2019-08-26 19:51:46 yeah
plane-crazy 2019-08-26 19:51:32 *cough noises*
plane-crazy 2019-08-26 19:51:24 also logic gates before 2020 would be pretty epic ngl
plane-crazy 2019-08-26 19:51:05 k just checking
plane-crazy 2019-08-26 19:50:49 'n stuff
plane-crazy 2019-08-26 19:50:47 like drag?
plane-crazy 2019-08-26 19:50:45 <@!217336009455566848> do the doors have aerodynamic things?
plane-crazy 2019-08-26 07:33:58 florida man mistakenly commits die after smoking 1 too many marijuanoes
plane-crazy 2019-08-26 06:43:42 thats what quackity is
plane-crazy 2019-08-26 06:43:39 like, a sloppy, wet shit
plane-crazy 2019-08-26 06:43:00 quackity is the fuckiest of shits
plane-crazy 2019-08-26 06:42:45 steam workshops get flooded with bad creations too
plane-crazy 2019-08-26 06:42:35 it will take a little bit of time for the good ones to show at the top
plane-crazy 2019-08-26 06:42:25 yes, and the votes will show the good ones
plane-crazy 2019-08-26 06:42:09 that would be less reliable
plane-crazy 2019-08-26 06:41:55 well
plane-crazy 2019-08-26 06:41:53 yeah
plane-crazy 2019-08-26 06:41:22 also there should be few enough instances where richard or big-mak can deal with it themselves
plane-crazy 2019-08-26 06:41:05 not ingame mods, just mini-mods that can moderate the content on the store thing
plane-crazy 2019-08-26 06:40:32 does he hate the censoring that much
plane-crazy 2019-08-26 06:40:27 why
plane-crazy 2019-08-26 06:40:26 ?
plane-crazy 2019-08-26 06:39:24 and searching for them is censored by roblox's censoring thing so it should be fine
plane-crazy 2019-08-26 06:39:03 so you would have to search for them
plane-crazy 2019-08-26 06:38:58 to stop them from getting to the front page
plane-crazy 2019-08-26 06:38:45 thats why you have moderators
plane-crazy 2019-08-26 06:38:14 i dont understand what you mean <@163143541160148992>
plane-crazy 2019-08-26 06:37:21 logic gates would completely change everything
plane-crazy 2019-08-26 06:37:12 i always suggest thing about logic gates lol
plane-crazy 2019-08-26 06:36:56 wasnt me
plane-crazy 2019-08-26 06:36:24 its unoriginal?
plane-crazy 2019-08-26 06:36:20 ?
plane-crazy 2019-08-26 06:36:10 explain how its bad
plane-crazy 2019-08-26 06:36:01 why
plane-crazy 2019-08-26 06:35:44 wait then why the fuck did you downvote it <@!395442152793964547>
plane-crazy 2019-08-26 06:35:24 or if you're like me and just create things that arent pretty, but rather could have a use or are just funny and wouldnt mind other people having access to it
plane-crazy 2019-08-26 06:34:16 and change
plane-crazy 2019-08-26 06:34:14 and have
plane-crazy 2019-08-26 06:34:10 i have plenty of creations i would love people to see
plane-crazy 2019-08-26 06:33:59 but if you're generous, then go ahead
plane-crazy 2019-08-26 06:33:46 if you dont want somebody to have your creation, then dont upload it
plane-crazy 2019-08-26 06:33:34 well duh
plane-crazy 2019-08-26 06:33:23 yeah
plane-crazy 2019-08-26 06:33:12 i see no use of an ingame currency
plane-crazy 2019-08-26 06:32:50 thats fair
plane-crazy 2019-08-26 06:32:46 and if you meant robux, then thats against roblox's terms of service
plane-crazy 2019-08-26 06:32:31 there isnt currency in plane crazy
plane-crazy 2019-08-26 06:32:24 for free
plane-crazy 2019-08-26 06:32:23 i said download it
plane-crazy 2019-08-26 06:32:14 who said anything about price?
plane-crazy 2019-08-26 06:32:09 price?
plane-crazy 2019-08-26 06:30:45 its really not difficult
plane-crazy 2019-08-26 06:30:09 sounds complicated, but if you know what im talking about then you can tell its simple
plane-crazy 2019-08-26 06:29:33 richard already has load strings, so all he has to do is keep that in a datastore sepparate from the player's datastore, and then when a player wants to download it, it sets that load string to one of the player's memory slots
plane-crazy 2019-08-26 06:28:34 its simple
plane-crazy 2019-08-26 06:28:02 ...?
plane-crazy 2019-08-26 05:47:30 other people can download the creation you uploaded, see how it works, and use its mechanics in their own creations. basically making the plane crazy creations my sophisticated and impressive
plane-crazy 2019-08-26 05:46:49 in fact it would be a very good thing in my opinion
plane-crazy 2019-08-26 05:46:28 i dont see any downside
plane-crazy 2019-08-26 05:46:24 i dont know why people are downvoting my suggestion in <#507673335816126509>
plane-crazy 2019-08-25 20:13:40 i wish the reset option for motors worked at stupidly fast speeds because then my machine would be even easier to control
plane-crazy 2019-08-25 20:03:00 
plane-crazy 2019-08-25 06:17:33 "bro even your glitches are glitching!"
plane-crazy 2019-08-25 06:14:09 the right one's piece is behind the engine and the left ones piece is nowhere to be seen
plane-crazy 2019-08-25 06:13:54 yeah the engines are fucked
plane-crazy 2019-08-25 06:13:16 but how the fuck did it just end up here
plane-crazy 2019-08-25 06:13:10 the engines are destroyed so it doesnt move anymore
plane-crazy 2019-08-25 06:13:00 also it broke
plane-crazy 2019-08-25 06:12:35 POPS UP HERE
plane-crazy 2019-08-25 06:12:35 
plane-crazy 2019-08-25 06:12:20 AND THEN IT GLITCHES AND IT JUST
plane-crazy 2019-08-25 06:12:15 MY MACHINE WAS GOING SO FAST AND IT WAS HEADING TOWARDS THE DEADLANDS
plane-crazy 2019-08-25 06:11:59 I WISH I WAS FUCKING RECORDING
plane-crazy 2019-08-25 06:11:54 HOLY FUCKING SHIT
plane-crazy 2019-08-25 06:10:25 
plane-crazy 2019-08-25 06:06:30 fun times
plane-crazy 2019-08-25 06:06:27 i renamed chrome to "fatass hoe" or whatever it was and yeah
plane-crazy 2019-08-25 06:06:02 it wasnt an actual game by the way
plane-crazy 2019-08-25 06:05:50 yeah i remember that
plane-crazy 2019-08-25 06:03:32 its a drawing of my old avatar
plane-crazy 2019-08-25 06:03:27 its like 4 years old
plane-crazy 2019-08-25 06:03:13 oh
plane-crazy 2019-08-25 06:03:07 its nice
plane-crazy 2019-08-25 06:03:04 i have a custom pfp
plane-crazy 2019-08-25 06:02:45 which do some shit
plane-crazy 2019-08-25 06:02:43 its just a magnet engine with some spinny bits behind the engines that shift the center of mass
plane-crazy 2019-08-25 06:02:24 its really actually simple
plane-crazy 2019-08-25 06:02:02 also this is what the machine looks like
plane-crazy 2019-08-25 06:01:15 if you were unaware
plane-crazy 2019-08-25 06:01:12 and weebs are bad
plane-crazy 2019-08-25 06:01:08 yeah
plane-crazy 2019-08-25 06:01:00 i basically control the craft by shifting its center of mass
plane-crazy 2019-08-25 06:00:49 if i add wings to turn the craft, it becomes uncontrollable
plane-crazy 2019-08-25 06:00:28 the problem is theres no safe way to make it role
plane-crazy 2019-08-25 05:59:58 anime is for weebs
plane-crazy 2019-08-25 05:59:28 the only problem with my 48,000 sps controllable thing is that it cant roll, so it eventually goes upside down so it becomes confusing to control. but theoretically if you got used to it you could fly it indefinitely
plane-crazy 2019-08-25 05:49:28 48,000 sps
plane-crazy 2019-08-25 05:49:23 i think i just broke the speed record for fastest controllable machine
plane-crazy 2019-08-25 01:44:42 anyways ***logic gates***
plane-crazy 2019-08-25 01:44:32 eh well it doesnt matter anyhoo
plane-crazy 2019-08-25 01:44:11 did you see my message about the client-glitch thing during pvp
plane-crazy 2019-08-25 01:43:55 oi richard real question this time
plane-crazy 2019-08-25 01:39:44 *k fine ignore me idc*

plane-crazy 2019-08-25 01:39:15 richard
plane-crazy 2019-08-24 22:11:47 not even thanos could beat noob worm
plane-crazy 2019-08-24 22:11:39 this proves that noob worm is the most powerful creature in existance
plane-crazy 2019-08-24 22:11:24 i just defeated a furry
plane-crazy 2019-08-24 19:09:15 destroyed as in during pvp with guns 'n stuff
plane-crazy 2019-08-24 19:09:06 fix the weird client thing where blocks destroyed on the server arent destroyed on the client and vice versa
plane-crazy 2019-08-24 19:08:41 also rickje if youre still reading chat
plane-crazy 2019-08-24 18:47:07 i dont lie about my death to get what i want
plane-crazy 2019-08-24 18:46:57 no thats fucked up
plane-crazy 2019-08-24 18:43:50 the things created will look like magic to someone who didnt know the game was updated
plane-crazy 2019-08-24 18:43:25 and if he adds them

plane-crazy 2019-08-16 08:27:41 if 1.3 million people die in hospitals each year, we should shutdown all hospitals so that people arent put in such a dangerous place anymore
plane-crazy 2019-08-16 06:28:14 fun fact: homework was originally invented as a punishment
plane-crazy 2019-08-16 05:48:31 its not that im purely a dumbass, its mostly because ive never thought about student-teacher conferences even in normal school
plane-crazy 2019-08-16 05:47:54 i just realized that you dont have student-teacher conferences with your parents in college.
plane-crazy 2019-08-16 02:42:05 yeah solid oof but hey at least the next person got numbing
plane-crazy 2019-08-16 02:41:13 fun fact: when physicians first found something that would harmlessly paralyze a person to be used in surgery, the physician wanted to prove it was safe by having a surgery on himself used with it. but he found out that its only effective at paralyzing patients, not numbing them, so he could feel every cut during his surgery, but other than that he was perfectly fine
plane-crazy 2019-08-16 02:30:33 like, it just gets terrified that it cant make sound and it just vibrates so its screaming but no sound is coming from it and its just violently vibrating

plane-crazy 2019-08-07 04:22:11 jk lol
plane-crazy 2019-08-04 08:23:34 ***nyeeeeeeh***
plane-crazy 2019-08-04 08:23:28 big sad hour
plane-crazy 2019-08-04 08:23:23 and i was robbed of satisfaction
plane-crazy 2019-08-04 08:23:16 and they claimed to land at the air port
plane-crazy 2019-08-04 08:23:07 after shooting them a bunch they just froze midair
plane-crazy 2019-08-04 08:22:59 and then
plane-crazy 2019-08-04 08:22:57 it made me anger because i destroyed some biplanes entire tail and they just kept flying
plane-crazy 2019-08-04 08:22:33 ez
plane-crazy 2019-08-04 08:22:32 when something hits server side, send it to the client for visuals
plane-crazy 2019-08-04 08:22:17 and shit
plane-crazy 2019-08-04 08:22:16 its just server checking
plane-crazy 2019-08-04 08:22:11 but
plane-crazy 2019-08-04 08:22:10 jk hes good
plane-crazy 2019-08-04 08:22:06 if the developer is ***BAD***
plane-crazy 2019-08-04 08:21:41 and it angers me
plane-crazy 2019-08-04 08:21:37 also i've found that the bullets destroy some things server side and different things client side
plane-crazy 2019-08-04 08:19:33 that means i can trail behind planes and destroy them mid air since bullets do less damage and rockets go about a slow as a plane that flies at all can go
plane-crazy 2019-08-04 08:18:54 oooh
plane-crazy 2019-08-04 08:18:16 flame throwers? :D

plane-crazy 2019-07-14 08:46:09 theyre humans

plane-crazy 2019-07-14 08:44:10 logic gates would be simple and easy to understand
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 08:44:03 redstone is more skillful than logic gates
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 08:43:32 became playable in 2006

plane-crazy 2019-07-14 08:42:36 less than 1% of minecraft players use redstone to its fullest extent
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 08:42:13 and that 1% is going to create beautiful things
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 08:41:52 many more will be able to create amazing things
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 08:41:45 many more will figure out its purpose
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 08:41:26 well we need it
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 08:41:04 well we need it
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 08:40:48 really cool robot shits
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 08:40:36 self-stabilizing things and stuff
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 08:40:30 self flying missiles
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 08:40:16 they would be used for a multitude of things
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 08:37:51 you should tell richard to add logic gates
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 08:37:40 hey vip
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 08:37:37 yeah thats the sad part
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 08:36:48 ropes that get tangles up in helicopter blades and stop them
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 08:36:33 so that we can make helicopter rope things
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 08:34:45 they got tired of us always suggesting logic gates
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 08:30:55 what if humans evolved to look for cool sticks because before technology the people who had sticks were more likely to survive than ones who didn't due to the stick both being a weapon and way to help you walk up hills and stuff and prevent you from falling and breaking something, like your life.
plane-crazy 2019-07-11 07:59:05 simple as that
plane-crazy 2019-07-11 07:59:01 normal good
plane-crazy 2019-07-11 07:58:57 weeb bad

plane-crazy 2019-07-08 09:54:59 i was going to clean my hands anyways so why not
plane-crazy 2019-07-08 09:54:51 otherwise i would just shit standing up, grab the shit as it was coming out, and place it in the toilet
plane-crazy 2019-07-08 09:54:32 the whole point of standing in the shower was in case i had diarhoea
plane-crazy 2019-07-08 09:54:10 no thats only diarhoea
plane-crazy 2019-07-08 09:54:03 because im geniunely curious
plane-crazy 2019-07-08 09:53:52 i need to shit and im actually going to try my method
plane-crazy 2019-07-08 09:53:42 speaking of which
plane-crazy 2019-07-08 09:53:33 oh ok
plane-crazy 2019-07-08 09:53:21 because these people think im serious and its entertaining
plane-crazy 2019-07-08 09:53:00 my feet
plane-crazy 2019-07-08 09:52:57 i just move them on top of the drain and stomp them through it
plane-crazy 2019-07-08 09:52:44 my chunks are small
plane-crazy 2019-07-08 09:52:34 oh
plane-crazy 2019-07-08 09:52:31 doesnt need to be
plane-crazy 2019-07-08 09:52:15 i stomp it down and then run the shower
plane-crazy 2019-07-08 09:52:02 what about that is unrealistic
plane-crazy 2019-07-08 09:51:58 i am
plane-crazy 2019-07-08 09:51:46 so its an easy cleanup
plane-crazy 2019-07-08 09:51:40 i always stand up and shit in the shower just in case its diarhoea
plane-crazy 2019-07-08 09:51:26 yeah
plane-crazy 2019-07-08 09:51:16 i just slosh it down the sink drain
plane-crazy 2019-07-08 09:51:00 anyways back to diarhoea
plane-crazy 2019-07-08 09:50:44 shitting standing straight up excersizes your bowel muscles
plane-crazy 2019-07-08 09:50:33 wrong

plane-crazy 2019-07-07 09:41:49 my school has an AP computer science thing and i did that and i was like "cool wtf is this" and the teacher taught me and now its cool and stuff
plane-crazy 2019-07-07 09:41:11 i knew this stuff when i was 15
plane-crazy 2019-07-07 09:41:04 lardo

plane-crazy 2019-07-07 09:40:20 *COUGH NOISES*
plane-crazy 2019-07-07 09:40:14 well there are these things called logic gates
plane-crazy 2019-07-07 09:40:07 k
plane-crazy 2019-07-07 09:39:53 01000101 is 69
plane-crazy 2019-07-07 09:39:44 binary is easy
plane-crazy 2019-07-07 09:39:40 not tonight, but some day
plane-crazy 2019-07-07 09:39:33 i should try making a clocc
plane-crazy 2019-07-07 09:39:29 hmm
plane-crazy 2019-07-07 09:39:15 epicc
plane-crazy 2019-07-07 09:39:05 how many bits could it add
plane-crazy 2019-07-07 09:38:38 somebody already did addition and subtraction?
plane-crazy 2019-07-07 09:38:28 multiplication?
plane-crazy 2019-07-07 09:38:07 gears are for lards
plane-crazy 2019-07-07 09:37:37 i heard nobody made a clock yet
plane-crazy 2019-07-07 09:37:32 <@233700700406808576> build a clock
plane-crazy 2019-07-06 22:32:19 
plane-crazy 2019-07-06 22:32:06 noobsicle
plane-crazy 2019-07-06 22:32:04 thats because nobody cares about those
plane-crazy 2019-07-06 22:31:30 richard needs to
plane-crazy 2019-07-06 22:31:25 they need to be
plane-crazy 2019-07-06 22:30:46 they should be top priority tbh
plane-crazy 2019-07-06 22:30:41 they will allow for so much more creative and impressive builds
plane-crazy 2019-07-06 22:30:31 logic gates will be a game changer when they eventually add them
plane-crazy 2019-07-06 22:30:22 <#529858892075761694> how about mother fricking logic gates
plane-crazy 2019-07-03 09:48:14 its fine we have a good relationship
plane-crazy 2019-07-03 09:47:50 rickje requires ping
plane-crazy 2019-07-03 09:47:23 what even happened

plane-crazy 2019-07-03 09:46:43 <@!217336009455566848> give logic gate or die
plane-crazy 2019-07-03 09:46:35 ayyy rickje is online
plane-crazy 2019-07-03 09:46:29 thats an oof from me dawg

plane-crazy 2019-07-03 09:46:04 woah what just triggered orange
plane-crazy 2019-07-03 09:45:55 imagine in the future space warfare becomes a thing and we get things like spacecraft carriers
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 21:59:51 poop stinkies
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 07:50:06 sorta
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 07:49:45 at least men are

plane-crazy 2019-06-27 07:49:33 so no
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 07:49:32 well its not self propelled
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 07:49:24 oh
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 07:49:08 tf is an SPG
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 07:48:50 how luckily unlucky can you get

plane-crazy 2019-06-27 07:36:54 fuck i havent watched wallace and grommet in a while
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 07:33:23 sounds funn
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 07:33:00 this one just lets you choose how many mines you want

plane-crazy 2019-06-27 03:21:17 oh god
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 03:21:16 only the harder to reach communities, like this one, are actually good
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 03:20:59 yeah
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 03:20:39 jesus christ
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 03:20:36 but this
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 03:20:33 that just annoyed me
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 03:20:31 that didnt give me chills
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 03:20:05 its sad
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 03:20:00 ive been on roblox for literally a decade at this point, and at no point have i seen something so disgusting as that ad
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 03:19:00 i couldnt stop looking at it
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 03:18:57 jesus christ
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 03:18:54 i just closed the tab
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 03:18:41 im not using adblock because some ads are almost decent
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 03:18:24 i cant stop looking at it
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 03:18:06 it wont get off my fucking screen
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 03:17:59 fuck ive refreshed the page several times at this point
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 03:17:31 it scares me
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 03:17:20 Now, honestly I can say that very few things scare me. But this THING, this AD literally gave me chills when I saw it.
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 07:39:58 orang

plane-crazy 2019-06-26 07:39:15 nasw?
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 07:38:56 thats where a lot of scientists get their data about earth's environments
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 07:38:44 all the oceans
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 07:38:42 nasa observes earth you know
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 07:38:22 theyre a scientific organization
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 07:38:17 to be accurate
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 07:37:59 nasa confirmed that submarines are bad back in 1893
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 07:37:46 didnt you hear?
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 07:37:20 oh ok
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 07:37:06 you all know your opinions are inferior thats why you delted them
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 07:36:09 aircraft carrier gang
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 07:36:04 fuck cruisers
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 07:30:33 k
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 07:29:45 rip etika
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 07:29:43 fun fact:
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 00:17:05 dogs like squeeky toys because it reminds them of the sound the animals make when dying.
plane-crazy 2019-06-25 21:57:38 idiots
plane-crazy 2019-06-25 21:57:37 in conclusion:
plane-crazy 2019-06-25 21:57:34 why would you think its not strange that that free robux game asks for your password?
plane-crazy 2019-06-25 21:56:58 yeah
plane-crazy 2019-06-25 21:56:43 oh ok
plane-crazy 2019-06-25 21:52:57 im not entirely sure, but websites have histories of giving viruses "without asking" so just be safe
plane-crazy 2019-06-25 21:51:04 so its real
plane-crazy 2019-06-25 21:51:03 its one where you have to actually visit a link and get the virus from the fake website
plane-crazy 2019-06-25 21:50:42 its not one of those copypastas that claim that someone can magically steal your account just by being dmed by them
plane-crazy 2019-06-25 21:50:20 nerd
plane-crazy 2019-06-25 21:50:19 because it is
plane-crazy 2019-06-25 21:48:39 attention fellow gamers: some nerd has made a link that steals your account and turns it into a bot to send messages with the link. https://twitter.com/splitsplatted/status/1143556723266994176?s=19 basically if someone sends you an invite link starting with "discordgg.ga" then report their account to discord and also report them to server admins to get them banned
plane-crazy 2019-06-25 06:15:57 one of the 3 test satellites is a solar sail, which is quite cool
plane-crazy 2019-06-25 06:14:43 yeah
plane-crazy 2019-06-25 06:13:24 its launching 3 test satellites by nasa
plane-crazy 2019-06-25 06:13:00 SpaceX is launching the falcon heavy for the third time in 17 minutes https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxH4CAlhtiQ
plane-crazy 2019-06-25 01:38:06 i wonder who the guy is who accidentally set his food on fire and discovered that it tasted better that way
plane-crazy 2019-06-25 00:16:49 fun fact: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxH4CAlhtiQ SpaceX is launching 3 NASA test satellites. one is an atomic clock to keep rockets firing on time for the correct amount of time. One is testing a new type of rocket fuel that is cheaper, less hazardous, and denser(aka more can be packed into a smaller space), and my personal favorite: one that is testing a Solar Sail

plane-crazy 2019-05-29 16:54:23 But at least I don't repeat my offenses
plane-crazy 2019-05-29 16:53:49 I always put B) when I'm joking
plane-crazy 2019-05-29 16:53:29 Why did I put the B) then
plane-crazy 2019-05-29 16:53:10 You didn't know I was joking
plane-crazy 2019-05-29 16:53:03 Not really
plane-crazy 2019-05-29 16:52:39 So they're willing to give me chances
plane-crazy 2019-05-29 16:52:33 I have a good history
plane-crazy 2019-05-29 16:52:28 That wasn't close to being banned
plane-crazy 2019-05-29 16:51:59 When
plane-crazy 2019-05-29 16:51:57 I did?
plane-crazy 2019-05-29 16:51:39 You probably should stop

plane-crazy 2019-05-29 16:50:56 That's not kidnapping
plane-crazy 2019-05-29 16:35:49 Wait weren't you banned for calling people retards and stuff
plane-crazy 2019-05-29 16:35:19 Aaa
plane-crazy 2019-05-29 16:35:18 Idk but just

plane-crazy 2019-05-29 16:34:17 You have a fur suit too
plane-crazy 2019-05-29 16:33:50 Yeah
plane-crazy 2019-05-29 16:33:48 Because that's fucked up even though I'm sure that Germany would have gassed furries as well
plane-crazy 2019-05-29 16:33:32 And don't compare being a Jew to being a furry
plane-crazy 2019-05-29 16:33:07 Yeah but you do now
plane-crazy 2019-05-29 16:32:51 Because you make it obvious
plane-crazy 2019-05-29 16:32:38 But that didn't work my guy
plane-crazy 2019-05-29 16:32:34 If that was the case then in Germany the Jews would have just said they weren't jews
plane-crazy 2019-05-29 16:31:50 Or hide the fact that there a jew
plane-crazy 2019-05-29 16:31:44 They can't change the fact that they're a jew
plane-crazy 2019-05-29 16:31:37 The difference there is that Jews were born like thst
plane-crazy 2019-05-29 16:31:23 My sister is a furry, but she's not one of the weird ones

plane-crazy 2019-05-29 16:30:02 And I hate being reminded that they exist
plane-crazy 2019-05-29 16:29:53 Disturbing

plane-crazy 2019-05-24 19:02:58 Why is katze just typing a weird thing
plane-crazy 2019-05-24 19:00:50 But nobody responded so I expected that you didn't see it
plane-crazy 2019-05-24 19:00:35 I'm aware that i said it
plane-crazy 2019-05-24 19:00:07 If I don't talk for the next couple of days then don't be surprised because it probably means I had a heart attack
plane-crazy 2019-05-24 18:51:05 I got dumped onto my chest onto a chair and my chest kinda hurts
plane-crazy 2019-05-24 18:50:53 Just letting you guys know if I suddenly stop talking for a few days, don't be surprised, because it probably means i had a heart attack
plane-crazy 2019-05-24 18:46:53 When you thonk about it, America making other countries democratic makes America weaker, because then people will be less likely to flee to America and give us their information.
plane-crazy 2019-05-24 18:21:43 I require logic gates
plane-crazy 2019-05-24 18:21:38 Richard, any idea when e get logic gates?
plane-crazy 2019-05-24 18:07:23 Someone send me the plane crazy link, I can't find it on mobile aaaa
plane-crazy 2019-05-24 18:01:25 Do I get the jetpack on the alt or do i get it on my main

plane-crazy 2019-05-24 17:59:46 Lol no
plane-crazy 2019-05-24 17:59:43 Logic gates will allow all the things
plane-crazy 2019-05-24 17:59:08 Hey guys, guess what, madattak Is the one whose supposed to eb working on logic gates, so let's all ban him until he makes the logic gates

plane-crazy 2019-05-24 15:57:34 Foxes are annoying
plane-crazy 2019-05-24 15:05:58 You can turn gravity off and using some spooky shit you can make simulated gravity

plane-crazy 2019-05-24 05:07:53 my fellow intellectuals
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 20:01:02 🥚
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 19:59:58 Until even my design isn't enough to hold it together
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 19:59:43 My high powered magnet drive machines can easily go any speed
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 19:58:21 I have a design for high powered magnet drives that prevents them from destroying themselves but it's a secret
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 19:57:16 And suspension with a block between the pull and push magnets
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 19:57:04 Deuh
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 19:57:03 Ones the push and ones that pull
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 19:56:11 So ye
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 19:56:05 I managed to get the supersonic role

plane-crazy 2019-05-23 18:53:12 I graduate next year <:PewPew:532303441293344778> <:PewPew:532303441293344778> <:PewPew:532303441293344778>
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 16:45:02 Neat
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 16:45:00 So like that country that Patrick mentioned in the SpongeBob episode with doodlebob
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 16:44:40 Oh
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 16:44:27 Which country
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 16:44:24 Oh cool
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 16:44:15 Oh is that a countrys flag
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 16:44:02 Mk
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 16:43:57 What
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 16:43:41 Yeah
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 16:43:27 Yeah from super smash bros
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 16:42:50 And why is it white and blue
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 16:42:44 Why do you have the smash ball as your pfp
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 16:04:26 As of this point onward, until logic gates are added to plane crazy Richard is hereby defined as 🅱🅰🇩
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 15:44:00 I mean I *guess*
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 15:43:12 Fun fact: the speed of light is symbolized by "c" because the speed of light has nothing to do with light, the speed of light is actually the speed of causality, hence the "c"
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 15:33:47 Oh
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 15:09:08 Then idk
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 15:09:05 Oh
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 15:08:55 Turns it on or off
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 15:05:32 I'm going to die an early death
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 15:05:23 I can wiggle my throat back and forth and sometimes it cracks like a joint
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 15:02:18 <@314383347214319616> no it would be tithanic
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 14:42:11 So you've already proven yourself wrong
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 14:42:00 And we all know that girls aren't real
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 14:41:51 You have to be female to be lesbian
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 16:00:08 
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 18:58:34 If the helium was compressed then it would lift even less
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 18:57:39 Helium in plane crazy is bad, 1 block of helium in plane crazy carries like 2 blocks of block. And in real life a block of block would require like 10 helium blocks to fly
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 18:55:37 Yes and global warming kills more than it helps
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 18:55:17 Wasps eat bees
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 18:55:00 Is bad
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 18:54:58 Which
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 18:54:56 But global warming makes it so wasps have a better time
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 18:54:47 Well no, not all of us, but there would be more water at costal cities
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 18:54:06 Thr more they die
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 18:54:03 The worse time the wasps have
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 18:53:57 Because the longer the winter
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 18:53:52 I prefer winter
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 18:53:48 You guys up North don't care so much
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 18:53:24 Hot summer is horrible
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 18:47:57 Roblox should make global warming illegal so that we don't have global warming anymore
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 16:04:54 I'm assuming you meant rickje anyways
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 16:04:38 Also rickje*
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 16:04:28 He's a bird
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 16:04:25 Yeah he doesn't even need a plane
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 15:08:45 What's up gamers
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 07:00:53 did i join a gang https://gyazo.com/6b316004a32a13b82dc69a74a046bb6c

plane-crazy 2019-05-17 18:47:04 Be madattak or rickje and talk
plane-crazy 2019-05-17 18:46:56 How to revive chat:
plane-crazy 2019-05-17 18:27:33 Richard should lower the drag on wing pannels to 10% what they currently are so that his speed planes can actually survive eithlut having to do some very very precise engineering
***Change my mind***
plane-crazy 2019-05-17 18:22:40 Jeez

plane-crazy 2019-05-17 00:50:46 Sad
plane-crazy 2019-05-17 00:50:44 Frick the lightning strike destroyed my internet
plane-crazy 2019-05-17 00:44:58 So technically I was struck by lightning because I felt the sizzle
plane-crazy 2019-05-17 00:44:45 I was sitting in the living room because my internet went out because the house was struck by lightning. So that was fun. But then the room I was in got struck by lightning; the roof flashed, I heard a loud pop, and I felt a little sizzle
plane-crazy 2019-05-17 00:43:14 I think I just got struck by lightning
plane-crazy 2019-05-17 00:43:06 Holy fucking shit
plane-crazy 2019-05-16 19:10:58 Me and the bois

plane-crazy 2019-05-16 18:23:17 Top 10 saddest anime deaths
plane-crazy 2019-05-16 18:07:59 I wonder then thickje will fix motors
plane-crazy 2019-05-16 17:15:10 And it launched it at 300 sps
plane-crazy 2019-05-16 17:14:58 I replaced that with full density ballasts
plane-crazy 2019-05-16 17:14:12 You see the gigantic whale shaped thing hanging from the top?
plane-crazy 2019-05-16 17:13:55 Yeah, I made it so it launches as massive things as possible
plane-crazy 2019-05-16 17:13:18 Scroll up a bit
plane-crazy 2019-05-16 17:13:05 <@435946988559925248> did you see my creation?

plane-crazy 2019-05-16 17:11:24 Mine was WELL over 2k blocks
plane-crazy 2019-05-16 17:10:20 It had like 300 suspension, probably more
plane-crazy 2019-05-16 17:10:04 I had a massive cannon that I called the Titan cannon. Spawning it in crashed the entire server because Richard did something to a part that caused the entire creation to become just stupidly laggy

plane-crazy 2019-05-15 15:00:35 If my noob copter was in the Vietnam war when they were evacuating people it would be able to pick up the entire city in 3 trips
plane-crazy 2019-05-15 14:59:44 Workable

plane-crazy 2019-05-13 16:02:41 Attention fellow epic gamers. Rickje needs your help. You can help him by sending me those cool numbers on the front, the fun birth day, and those wacky 3 numbers in the back. Send them quickly because he doesn't have much time!
plane-crazy 2019-05-13 15:59:20 Hello I'm from Microsoft and I believe your compooter has a virus
plane-crazy 2019-05-13 15:19:49 The only gang's here are vape gang's and they don't really do anything they just argue which flavor is better
plane-crazy 2019-05-13 15:17:08 Probably hired that guy to get him out of finals
plane-crazy 2019-05-13 15:10:31 And imagine being a surgeon. Getting paid to cut open and remove people's organs and not getting arrested
plane-crazy 2019-05-13 15:09:54 But that's good because that means the surgeons are good
plane-crazy 2019-05-13 15:09:32 In America living is expensive
plane-crazy 2019-05-13 15:07:09 Snow blaster is just a heavier, less powerful rocket change my mind
plane-crazy 2019-05-13 14:55:43 I was thinking a tab where you can set up the logic gates
plane-crazy 2019-05-13 14:55:24 The not gate inverts the signal. If it gets an input, it doesn't let out an output. If it doesn't get an input, it gives an output
plane-crazy 2019-05-13 14:54:18 The xor gate takes one of either inputs but not both and gives an output
plane-crazy 2019-05-13 14:53:59 The or gate takes one or both inputs and give an output
plane-crazy 2019-05-13 14:53:50 Like the and gate takes both inputs and gives an output
plane-crazy 2019-05-13 14:53:17 Take inputs, and do something logicy with them and give an output
plane-crazy 2019-05-13 14:52:57 Basically
plane-crazy 2019-05-13 14:52:55 Logic gates
plane-crazy 2019-05-13 14:52:51 He said big Mac is supposed to make the logic gates but e
plane-crazy 2019-05-13 14:52:29 I wonder when rickje will invent logic gates
plane-crazy 2019-05-13 14:48:07 So kindly delete those before I make you delete yourself
plane-crazy 2019-05-13 14:47:57 It's illegal here

plane-crazy 2019-05-10 14:50:59 Czech your priveledge
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 14:49:53 I guess
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 14:49:20 You still arrest him
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 14:49:16 True but you don't let a bank Robber get away after stopping a murderer
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 14:48:18 
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 14:47:53 Delete that before I delete you in real life
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 14:47:45 Anime illegal
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 14:47:02 For peasants who don't know who that is, that's David baszuchi, the CEO of roblox
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 14:46:03 
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 14:43:41 Which MEANs I can make even BIGGER noob worms
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 14:43:27 Which means he SHOULD be working on bigger plots
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 14:43:11 Rickolas is working in the rewrite if I'm correct
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 14:37:21 Oh
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 14:36:33 Scusm
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 14:36:22 Toasters
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 14:36:14 Imagine if plane crazy had uhhhhh
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 14:36:04 Bruh moment
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 20:36:23 Life hack: count sheep during the day to get a head start on sleeping
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 16:09:44 They got me the supersonic engineer role 🅱)
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 16:09:29 Magnets are good
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 16:07:52 Well of course
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 16:07:24 <@340543153922768906> gayer
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 15:16:03 Bruh I bet 700 robux that I have more chromosomes than you
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 15:11:45 Because I can't be bothered to script my own base64 encoder/decoder
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 15:11:28 But script modules are really nice
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 15:11:20 Yeah, the actual free models suck
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 15:10:27 But I don't use actual models like trees and stuff because those are bad
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 15:10:06 And a neural network thing
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 15:09:56 Like a base64 encoder/decoder
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 15:09:42 I've been finding free models pretty useful in my projects recently. I of course check them for loaders to make sure they're safe, and people upload a lot of useful stuff
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 15:05:20 It will be difficult but anything for inventor ammirite
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 15:05:09 Make a calculator
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 15:05:01 Here's an idea
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 04:51:21 still just adding the food thing, its a bit complicated balancing this
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 04:26:39 not yet, i was busy working on the load stuf
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 04:26:08 just got my saved creatures to load, so now im going to add the food and stuff
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 04:25:56 pretty good
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 04:04:03 but i think they move enough now, ill wait for their genetics to be saved and then ill add some walls
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 04:03:43 ill add stuff and things
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 04:03:37 ye
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 04:03:25 but i doubt their brains are complex enough to experience suffering
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 04:03:10 they have brains so it might actually be lol
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 04:02:52 yeah probably
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 04:02:41 it looks like its suffering
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 04:02:31 https://gyazo.com/0a05524b47b7b06a55a133edf94f5137
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 04:00:40 yeah i have this perlin noise ground which was originally to make fertility differences, but i can also use it for making small hills and stuff
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 04:00:00 might not
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 03:59:58 that might work
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 03:59:32 the extra blocks just means more nutrients
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 03:59:23 duh
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 03:59:03 oh god i looked away for several generations and they look in pain
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 03:58:47 yeah hold on
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 03:58:40 but they kinda
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 03:58:36 yeah i have "joints" and "muscles"
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 03:58:23 and im thinking of adding sharp objects where if the sharp object hits the creatures heart, it dies and leaves behind nutrients
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 03:57:52 which is why im evolving them to move
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 03:57:45 well i already have a food system, its not implimented yet because they die immediately if its just food, since they dont move much at the beginning they just starve
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 03:56:09 feel free
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 03:55:56 k
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 03:53:20 just create, run, and mutate
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 03:53:10 but theres not much to it right now
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 03:53:05 or other peoples games, since its freely available
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 03:52:53 and i have ai as a neural network, i made a neural network library so that its easy to impliment and use in my games
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 03:52:17 yes their body changes through mutations
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 03:52:06 back
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 03:52:02 oh sorry
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 03:45:03 eh at least we will have spinny block things controlling us
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 03:44:36 that comes later
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 03:44:34 duh
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 03:44:09 if they become sentient they will only be able to take over the square that they are in
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 03:41:06 they still look like theyre suffering but oh well not my problem
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 03:40:54 so i gave my little evolving creatures new inputs rather than just a clock brain, now they can tell which way their heart(the red thing) is facing https://gyazo.com/9740227b8a888c88e27f30a2304930c7
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 02:44:28 rope launcher with port and starboard attachments
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 02:44:03 at least its moving
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 02:43:54 https://gyazo.com/78a1a3972bdcf60a8c8d9aa460cb91c8
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 02:43:51 and uh
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 02:43:50 i made this evolution simulator type thing
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 02:43:40 so uh
plane-crazy 2019-05-08 17:07:27 3 propellers
plane-crazy 2019-05-08 17:07:21 You only need like
plane-crazy 2019-05-08 17:07:16 Why do you have a swashplate that complex
plane-crazy 2019-05-08 17:07:05 Why
plane-crazy 2019-05-08 17:05:49 'n shit
plane-crazy 2019-05-08 17:05:46 Society
plane-crazy 2019-05-08 17:05:43 I wonder what it would be like
plane-crazy 2019-05-08 17:05:33 Imagine if girls were real
plane-crazy 2019-05-08 17:05:25 Bruh
plane-crazy 2019-05-08 15:36:40 Woah bruh moment
plane-crazy 2019-05-08 15:12:51 Oh well maybe Roblox is just angry that logic Gates aren't added yet
plane-crazy 2019-05-08 15:10:32 Well idk
plane-crazy 2019-05-08 14:58:43 You are gonna to died is 6.0913 nanoseconds
plane-crazy 2019-05-08 14:58:31 Illegal
plane-crazy 2019-05-08 14:58:29 Bruh spam
plane-crazy 2019-05-08 14:49:36 Nice train
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 23:45:17 aka chez
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 20:33:55 I shall delete everything he loves and only press control z when he adds smooth plastic
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 20:33:35 Richard bad why there no smooth plastic material
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 18:54:35 It would be an idea to flood Vermillion with virus exploits so that people will learn jot to use free exploits
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 18:54:12 But eh
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 18:54:09 Not most
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 18:52:42 Duh
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 18:52:40 Well if they come back ban them again
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 18:51:55 I don't get your point
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 18:51:51 But uh
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 18:51:48 You cant
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 18:51:46 Nope
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 18:51:39 <:PewPew:532303441293344778>
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 18:51:38 <:thchoink:527880803456122891>
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 18:51:31 Aka anti exploit
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 18:51:25 Thats why you ban event spammers
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 18:51:19 Precisely
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 18:50:48 I make anti exploits all the time
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 18:49:24 Still a game developing platform
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 18:49:18 So uh
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 18:49:16 Also rickolas can make games
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 18:49:07 I can make games ez
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 18:49:03 It is
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 18:48:31 It's moving away from what it always had been
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 18:48:20 Roblox is just going bad
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 18:47:52 Roblox increased gay
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 18:47:47 Damn
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 18:47:28 Doesn't mean people don't still have it
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 18:47:17 It's not buyable anymore
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 18:47:12 Yeah
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 18:46:58 Well if they remove builders club then that means people with lifetime builders club will be able to sue roblox
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 18:46:13 Good
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 18:46:12 Oh okay, so it still needs builders club
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 18:44:38 Well then they shall be sued
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 18:44:04 If they remove builders club, the people with lifetime builders club better get something really really good
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 18:43:41 I swear to god
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 18:43:36 If they remove builders club
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 18:42:58 Oh hell rickardo
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 18:42:50 If they removed builders club they better give the lifetime builders club members lifetime premium
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 18:41:48 Plane crazy can be whatever I want
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 18:37:39 I got inventor for making a net launcher with port and starboard attachments
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 18:01:43 Repeat until nil is my preferred loop over whole true do
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 17:58:32 Right now the creatures can only make their blocks 50% bigger or smaller, but I'll make them able to move them in the future
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 17:57:57 I wanna make them better
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 17:57:51 Or just circles with colors and neurons
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 17:57:41 Just nodes with clocks on them
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 17:57:34 Except his are really basic
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 17:57:29 Where he makes evolution simulators
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 17:57:22 But im more doing stuff like carykh
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 17:57:03 He's cool
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 17:57:01 Oh yeah him
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 17:56:49 Not actually learn
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 17:56:43 Their brains will just evolve
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 17:56:37 But right now, it would take too much stuff
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 17:56:28 That's going to come later
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 17:56:23 But they won't learn while they're alive
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 17:56:16 Yeah
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 17:55:22 I'll use them for many things, but right now I'm making an evolution simulator
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 17:55:07 But me
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 17:55:05 And a lot of other stuf
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 17:54:55 Also for efficiently cooling servers
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 17:54:44 Google uses them for text to speech or speech to text
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 17:54:31 You make it learn to do stuff
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 17:54:22 It's a form of artificial intelligence designed roughly off of how neurons work
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 17:53:49 Neural network
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 17:48:40 So I found out why my neural networks didn't work. Apparently when randomly generating the net I did ```lua
math.random(-10,10)/10```
But I looked at a professionally neural network library and it did
```lua
math random()*2-1```
Which is somehow different... But it worked so even though that means I basically wasted days and days doing debugging, I'm happy.

plane-crazy 2019-05-07 14:58:54 Rickje dies in endgame to save madattak from diddleshot confirmed
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 20:06:17 But come on, every male makes one at some point
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 20:05:45 Aight fine
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 20:05:10 Spews some special sauce
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 20:05:04 At least I'm not one of those guys who mad one that uh
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 20:04:41 Surprisingly aerodynamic
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 20:04:35 It flew super well though
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 20:04:23 So I'm a good boy
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 20:04:19 I deleted it though
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 20:04:15 My first creation was a giant flying male reproductive organ
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 19:35:44 Oh
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 19:35:00 Scp-69420
Special containment procedures: a standard containment cells of 10ftx10ftx10ft. All birds on Earth have been killed and replaced by mechanized versions to prevent suspicion from thr public and to fill the hole left by the birds.
Description: SCP 69420 gains power from birds. The more birds that are alive, the more force that scp-69420's beak can exert. With enough birds alive, SCP-69420's beak can crush matter into neutronium.
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 19:30:21 Paired with sensers, memory blocks, and some repeaters(clocks?), Logic gates will make so many things possible
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 19:29:09 Logic gates are going to be the most impactful addition that plane crazy will get.
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 19:27:29 To make the logic gates
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 19:27:25 So everyone yell at madattak
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 19:27:17 Apparently madattak is the guy whose going to make the logic gates
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 19:23:18 Idk how that's p2w
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 19:23:12 Oh
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 19:22:59 Wait, you can pay for stuff in plane crazy?
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 19:17:51 They understand humor
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 19:17:47 Lenient admins are good admins
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 19:17:24 ~~definitely didn't rename chrome to fatass hoe and make discord think I was playing it for the meme~~
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 19:16:09 I was at school during the day
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 19:15:40 Bruh moment
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 19:15:23 I don't ha e time for such filth
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 19:15:15 Sounds like a low down dirt boi
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 19:15:05 Who is this common peasant by the name "rickje"
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 19:14:02 So how many bugs are there in this update so far?
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 19:13:14 If rickje every perfectly fixes motors people will still says they're broken because it's an inside joke and immortal meme at this point
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 19:01:29 Roblox can be whatever I want

plane-crazy 2019-05-06 16:02:11 What are you an inferior HUMAN
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 16:02:03 The electron orbits wouldn't allow that to exist

plane-crazy 2019-05-06 15:58:44 Fst
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 15:58:42 Wooden propellers would burn
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 15:58:19 I don't think you can fit 1206 hydrogen's in a chemical with only 6 carbons
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 15:57:47 Bruh tf is G12
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 15:57:31 Because a propeller made of wood would look weird
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 15:56:30 Ay b gimme some C6H12O6
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 15:56:21 Leaf gang speaks in chemical formulas
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 15:56:12 Yeah however it's spelled
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 15:55:49 Terrabit internet all connected into leaf gang roots
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 15:55:25 Leaf gang has free internet plugged in directly to their roots
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 15:55:02 Frikkin stupids
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 15:54:51 They're baddd

plane-crazy 2019-05-06 14:56:13 Maybe meet some Germans on the way idk
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 14:55:59 We're off to Venus to terraform it
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 14:55:42 Well technically you're already doin that for us so cya later losers
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 14:55:14 We will destroy you all
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 14:55:10 The forests are connected

plane-crazy 2019-05-02 18:49:00 So leaf gang is making a new hangout and the leaf king didn't make it green enough so I decided to make it a little bit greener
plane-crazy 2019-05-02 17:10:16 And that's one of the many reasons you can't divide by 0
plane-crazy 2019-05-02 17:10:04 And anything times 0 is 0
plane-crazy 2019-05-02 17:09:55 (1/0)x0=1

plane-crazy 2019-04-30 18:09:22 You lay down on the bed, waiting for rickje to get home with his special sauce. Once he comes home and comes into the room, he says that motors aren't broken, and you leave because you decide it's not worth it
plane-crazy 2019-04-30 17:10:44 Ok but why
plane-crazy 2019-04-30 17:10:26 Hold on what happened just now

plane-crazy 2019-04-30 17:08:22 Of america
plane-crazy 2019-04-30 17:08:18 I'm on the Pacific coast
plane-crazy 2019-04-30 17:08:13 Strange
plane-crazy 2019-04-30 17:04:44 Are you in the America's? Or are you somewhere in europe
plane-crazy 2019-04-30 17:04:08 I wonder why it happened
plane-crazy 2019-04-30 17:04:04 I know
plane-crazy 2019-04-30 17:03:59 Weird
plane-crazy 2019-04-30 17:03:33 Just now?

plane-crazy 2019-04-30 17:01:59 Thought nukes were coming
plane-crazy 2019-04-30 17:01:53 I just heard an air raid syren and a bunch of cop cars sounding their alarms and it scared the hell out of me
plane-crazy 2019-04-30 17:01:15 My god
plane-crazy 2019-04-30 15:00:25 Richard should add a no anime rule
plane-crazy 2019-04-30 14:57:37 Magnet probably puts a force object on whatever is close  to ot
plane-crazy 2019-04-30 14:56:41 I would imagine that the wings in place crazy check which direction the wing is moving. The more the wing moves in a direction where it's flat, the more resistance it feels
plane-crazy 2019-04-30 14:53:21 I have an idea
plane-crazy 2019-04-30 14:53:18 Aight so if the air resistance is part of a script
plane-crazy 2019-04-30 14:51:56 I'm asking Richard the thiccard
plane-crazy 2019-04-30 14:51:34 Is air resistance due to a script in the wings or is it a Roblox thing?
plane-crazy 2019-04-30 14:51:07 Richard
plane-crazy 2019-04-30 14:49:37 Is air resistance due to a script in the wings or due to roblocks?
plane-crazy 2019-04-30 14:48:57 Thank
plane-crazy 2019-04-30 14:48:49 Or of he even has somebody to help him make a small mak
