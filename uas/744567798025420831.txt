creations-chat 2022-03-10 09:37:51 i use tight motorlocking, not a large workspace so i used a block, connected by texts and a block to prevent the lock from going farther.
creations-chat 2022-03-10 09:40:05 that image was a different model compared to what i made, and also thanks for the suggestion but the angle lock of motorlocks works well already.
creations-chat 2022-03-10 09:53:05 thank you so much, ill try those out on my next build.
