help 2020-07-07 03:05:01 Are variable sweep wings a good idea or not?

help 2020-07-19 06:46:43 
help 2020-07-19 06:46:44 I need help, what's the best wing configuration?
help 2020-07-19 06:48:50 I'm asking for two reasons
help 2020-07-19 06:49:25 1.) For some reason it becomes a glorified fidget spinner when I placed a lot of control panels
2.) It's oversensitive in going up
help 2020-07-19 06:49:30 I'm making my own fighter jet
help 2020-07-19 06:50:04 A little bit, mostly for assisted steering
help 2020-07-19 06:50:35 ^
it worked on my other plane
help 2020-07-19 06:50:49 A smaller (but not modified tutorial plane sized) plane
help 2020-07-19 06:51:57 <@!287779983445721088> This plane has a conveyor drive, yet it works perfectly, in fact more than my previous designs involving locked motors
help 2020-07-19 06:55:57 Honestly during my period of using locked motors, it just felt so sluggish
help 2020-07-19 07:03:36 So, I tried using forward swept with minimal control panels
help 2020-07-19 07:04:01 Now it feels sensitive yet floaty
help 2020-07-19 07:06:08 <@!283153622496182274> I mean that was my first build that actually worked the way I wanted it to (fast and agile), and I kept it simple so I didn't have to bother with headache inducing problems
help 2020-07-19 07:07:15 I don't get how you people build large fighter jets
help 2020-07-19 07:07:24 Yet still make it go fast
help 2020-07-19 07:08:10 So motor locking's better than simply just attaching it to blocks?
help 2020-07-19 07:09:34 Are those motor locked wings?
help 2020-07-19 07:11:05 Bless my rendering distance

The plane relies on flaps to adjust pitch, but it can achieve a speed of 500 without the use of an afterburner (a conveyor drive) and has 360 degrees of roll
help 2020-07-20 05:34:21 <@456226577798135808> <@!318892614378061824> Already replaced almost every control panel with wing panels, and almost all of the wings anyways are an aileron
help 2020-07-20 05:37:19 The canards and flaps (both on the back of the body and on main wings) adjust pitch
The main wing itself has variable incidence to adjust roll alongside the tail wings
Only the vertical tail wing doesn't move, but even then it has control panels
help 2020-07-20 06:44:33 <@!457015367412482048> For turning, I just use vertically mounted motor 2s
Suspension could either be just suspension block with rope (easy way to get adjustable suspension), a Christie based suspension or a double wishbone, and for custom wheels I just make 5x5 tires out of fabric wedges and design the rims from there
help 2020-07-20 06:47:08 I'm just gonna take a picture of the double wishbone design I have and  let you figure it out from there

help 2020-07-20 06:48:28 
help 2020-07-20 06:48:46 Ignore the ropes, they're just there for adjusting the suspension on the go
help 2020-07-20 06:49:04 I mean, double wishbones ain't tiny
help 2020-07-20 06:49:18 I could just show you the smaller suspension and rope design
help 2020-07-20 06:52:25 
help 2020-07-20 06:53:32 Blue - Wheels
Red - Steering
Green - Arms (make sure the bottom part is only touching the suspension block and the upper part only the motor 2)
White - Adjustable suspension
help 2020-07-20 06:53:48 Oh, it could be any size you want
help 2020-07-20 06:54:02 I suggest you give it a stiffness of *at least* 20 and give it max suspension height
help 2020-07-20 06:54:14 That's what the ropes there for, to adjust the suspension height without exiting
help 2020-07-20 06:54:36 Aight, good luck
help 2020-07-20 06:58:40 Oh, the suspension and rope setup handles most of the stuff you'll need

help 2020-07-21 14:12:00 I'm gonna go ask for some advice for my jumbo jet
help 2020-07-21 14:13:10 For the main wings, should I use separate custom control surfaces for controlling pitch and roll or should I just combine into one flapperon to control both pitch and roll?
help 2020-07-21 14:13:35 Well, I do have an idea how I'll do that
help 2020-07-21 14:13:47 I'll just make a quick text diagram
help 2020-07-21 14:14:55 I'm imagining something like this

help 2020-07-21 14:15:43 A - Pitch control 
B - Roll control

AO—OB
help 2020-07-21 14:15:48 There
help 2020-07-21 14:16:27 The only thing that prevents the wing panels from being welded are minimal amount of control panels
help 2020-07-21 14:17:39 I've managed to adjust yaw by simply adjusting both roll and pitch
help 2020-07-21 14:19:07 I mean, you could just go with what I did and just roll to your side and increase pitch
help 2020-07-21 14:20:57 In that case, I'll just stick with tilting my roll and increasing pitch
help 2020-07-21 14:22:02 Also, are four custom flaps necessary to get a good control of pitch?
help 2020-07-21 14:22:11 Like one behind and one in front/somewhere close

help 2020-07-23 02:01:18 I'm just making my own jet, I just wanted it to be very agile/very manuverable
help 2020-07-23 02:01:47 The wing is gonna be long, but not trying to make it large

help 2020-07-23 02:16:40 I also see it's just only slightly longer than my current fighter jet's wingspan
help 2020-07-23 02:17:01 But has less wing panels transverse to it's wingspan
help 2020-07-23 02:17:45 This is what I did so far
help 2020-07-23 02:18:21 Hmm, I guess I should experiment a bit then
help 2020-07-23 02:18:46 I'm still gonna use canards and variable incidence delta wings
help 2020-07-23 02:19:53 So large custom control surfaces?
help 2020-07-23 02:20:11 Yep, that's one thing I was told
help 2020-07-23 02:20:15 But for speed instead of flight agility
help 2020-07-23 02:21:24 So
- Hidden wings
- Lots of custom control surfaces
- Don't go overboard with wing size
- Canards and variable incidence wings
help 2020-07-23 02:21:57 Engines?
help 2020-07-23 02:22:17 Well, I guess I'll just go with a slight redesign of my existing plane then

help 2020-07-23 03:14:20 (I just use ballast blocks if it keeps pitching up too much)

creations-chat 2020-09-23 23:17:29 But not unde at least
creations-chat 2020-09-23 23:35:58 I've made a map suggestion <@273536574770380800>
creations-chat 2020-09-23 23:36:11 Yes
creations-chat 2020-09-23 23:36:18 Kinda detailed
creations-chat 2020-09-23 23:36:45 <@456226577798135808> Walk away and ignore
creations-chat 2020-09-23 23:40:03 <@273536574770380800> Pretty normal for me 

Look at the Holden Commodore ute
creations-chat 2020-09-23 23:40:14 That's normal in the upside down land
creations-chat 2020-09-23 23:40:43 The stance though, it bothers me
creations-chat 2020-09-23 23:40:56 Those wheels bother me more
creations-chat 2020-09-23 23:41:17 Also why make it a truck if the suspension go delete
creations-chat 2020-09-23 23:42:04 It's like deleting what made the Land Rover Range Rover good
creations-chat 2020-09-23 23:46:56 I have the high ground, Tankakin
creations-chat 2020-09-23 23:47:12 Literally
creations-chat 2020-09-23 23:48:33 Truck but van
creations-chat 2020-09-24 01:55:39 For a carrier, nothing is too long
creations-chat 2020-09-24 01:56:01 Length makes it easier for aircraft to land
creations-chat 2020-09-24 01:57:59 Also, width makes it easier for good aircraft to land
creations-chat 2020-09-24 01:58:09 Emphasis on good
creations-chat 2020-09-24 01:58:44 And yours looks better anyways
creations-chat 2020-09-24 01:59:53 Weight makes it harder for others to ram you while making it easier to ram others
creations-chat 2020-09-24 02:00:04 Assuming you have the speed
creations-chat 2020-09-24 02:00:31 Good
creations-chat 2020-09-24 02:00:55 Custom engines/drives and locked motors are a blessing in this game
creations-chat 2020-09-24 02:01:16 <@456226577798135808> "We're blasting off again"
creations-chat 2020-09-24 02:01:28 Because physics throttle
creations-chat 2020-09-24 02:01:37 That's the curse part
creations-chat 2020-09-24 02:02:05 Make sure your ship doesn't end up flying
creations-chat 2020-09-24 02:02:32 On my planes, good wing design is what keeps me from pitching extremely
creations-chat 2020-09-24 02:03:26 I just use one conveyor drive for stability reasons

creations-chat 2020-09-24 02:09:16 I like to call undes, undies
creations-chat 2020-09-24 02:09:41 Ah, so the r word
creations-chat 2020-09-24 02:10:07 I've done that before but as a missile
creations-chat 2020-09-24 02:10:23 Couldn't make them explode upon crashing
creations-chat 2020-09-24 02:10:28 Just the tip
creations-chat 2020-09-24 02:10:46 So I end up having to manually detonate them
creations-chat 2020-09-24 02:10:58 Rickje said he'll keep it as a feature

creations-chat 2020-09-24 02:18:43 What happened to Doggo?
creations-chat 2020-09-24 02:19:12 <@456226577798135808> What happened to Doggo? Doggeh.

creations-chat 2020-09-24 02:23:52 <@456226577798135808> Nah it's more fun kicking people down a hole and screaming the name of the place you're in
creations-chat 2020-09-24 02:24:09 ~~totally not referencing a dead, ancient meme~~
creations-chat 2020-09-24 02:24:51 What if we delete all the NSFW

~~and y'all can have your waifus or whatever the heck you're into~~
creations-chat 2020-09-24 02:31:03 I prefer Plane Crazy and Minecraft, with redstone or mods of course
creations-chat 2020-09-24 02:31:14 Redstone makes any Minecraft session fun with enough tinkering
creations-chat 2020-09-24 02:31:19 Same goes with mods
creations-chat 2020-09-24 02:31:37 <@710208141144489995> Sounds like Twitter

creations-chat 2020-09-24 02:38:05 I have a lot of apps
creations-chat 2020-09-24 02:38:21 Like it almost fills storage kind of full
creations-chat 2020-09-24 02:38:36 Nope, but I could get it
creations-chat 2020-09-24 02:38:47 But I'm really fine tbh
creations-chat 2020-09-24 02:38:59 I'd probably delete after enough pain
creations-chat 2020-09-24 02:40:17 ***it looks like those generic play store cringe***
creations-chat 2020-09-24 02:40:45 I'd rather pirate than play that unironically
creations-chat 2020-09-24 02:42:07 I wonder if Androeed has more good ALPs 

They usually make hacked APKs of games, and they actually work
creations-chat 2020-09-24 02:42:50 I mean this ain't a Mercedes
creations-chat 2020-09-24 02:43:09 Does Porsche make tanks?

creations-chat 2020-09-24 02:49:32 The AMD A series looks like a decent CPU ngl
creations-chat 2020-09-24 02:49:48 Higher end models could compete with the Intel i3
creations-chat 2020-09-24 02:50:07 After that, it's the Ryzen's job to compete with the i Series

bot-central 2020-09-24 23:37:55 O h
bot-central 2020-09-24 23:38:08 Well this is interesting
bot-central 2020-09-25 00:30:44 -mapsuggest Add a mixed surface rally style track for those suspension engineers. Off-road should test the effectiveness of suspensions while on-road should test stuff such as their stability against roll-overs (or just stability in general) and sharpness of handling
bot-central 2020-09-25 00:33:18 -mapsuggest Add a larger airport, perhaps more closer to an actual one just for that aesthetic while also adding a section for assisted take-offs
bot-central 2020-09-25 00:35:36 Wait this for maps, not for in game bugs
bot-central 2020-09-25 00:37:29 -mapsuggest For the more mountainous areas, add some somewhat wide natural, bumpy roads for those with rock crawlers. Not something impossible, but still difficult to traverse with non high-travel regular suspension
bot-central 2020-09-25 00:40:06 -mapsuggest Add a port for those with absurdly large ships and carriers. ~~So we can easily have tank carriers xp~~
bot-central 2020-09-25 00:41:22 <@385571953903271936> What did you expect when this suggestion command is open to everyone
bot-central 2020-09-25 00:41:32 No quality control
bot-central 2020-09-25 00:41:45 Because anyone can suggest
bot-central 2020-09-25 00:42:28 Don't make it harder onto the mods already
bot-central 2020-09-25 00:43:59 Yes, that's good
bot-central 2020-09-25 00:44:07 Especially for those with bullet trains
bot-central 2020-09-25 01:56:45 Rally style mixed surface race track
bot-central 2020-09-25 01:57:14 Plain tarmac race track kinda pointless except for bacons
bot-central 2020-09-25 01:58:15 I think I'll go try sketching my own map
bot-central 2020-09-25 01:59:20 <@690449203385729025> I was thinking off-roaders should have this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tipxvSscEWA
bot-central 2020-09-25 01:59:32 What you're thinking is more suited for rock crawlers
bot-central 2020-09-25 03:11:07 -mapsuggest https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/442834679004135434/758885502899322921/IMG_20200925_105344.jpg 

A quick sketch for a motocross or rally style race track, combined with a drag strip. For on road races, people could use the highway/road system in a sort of street race kind of race (think of Need For Speed)
bot-central 2020-09-25 08:08:39 That's interesting
bot-central 2020-09-25 08:08:53 <@!392334096560554001> Suggest it
bot-central 2020-09-25 08:09:24 I'd expect it will slow down cars
bot-central 2020-09-25 08:09:30 Might make rock crawling interesting
bot-central 2020-09-25 09:04:25 <@387195148741771275> Your suggestion makes me think of Initial D and Gymkhana
bot-central 2020-09-25 09:05:02 I wonder if there's room for rock crawlers though 

On the other hand, suspension in this game has a lot of travel already
bot-central 2020-09-25 09:06:36 My car related suggestion is related more into mixed surface rally and suspension/stabukity tests
bot-central 2020-09-25 09:07:09 Yes stability, phone typo
bot-central 2020-09-25 09:07:33 I mean you can't really drive a car if it keeps rolling over
bot-central 2020-09-25 09:07:40 Or if it has poor turning
bot-central 2020-09-25 09:08:15 I designed a track though it's mostly off road now that I think about it, though I did integrate a potential drag strip
bot-central 2020-09-25 09:08:43 Problem is when there's people on the strip, so I added an alt. route
bot-central 2020-09-25 09:08:53 Mountainous roads would be nice
bot-central 2020-09-25 09:09:23 ~~I remembered playing a game of Forza in its fictional mountain road though~~
bot-central 2020-09-25 09:09:30 ~~I struggled xp~~
bot-central 2020-09-25 09:11:31 Rick would probably have to shrink our ideas though if they're too big
bot-central 2020-09-25 09:12:01 What's the largest map in Roblox anyways?
bot-central 2020-09-25 09:12:33 Project Trackday I remember implemented the Le Mans track
bot-central 2020-09-25 09:12:40 And that thing is large in length
bot-central 2020-09-25 09:15:17 The ocean is large but naval warfare I'd expect to be small in the amount of space it actually consumes
bot-central 2020-09-25 09:16:52 Yeah that sounds nice
bot-central 2020-09-25 09:17:17 Though part of me wonders how we'll end up combining the efforts
bot-central 2020-09-25 09:17:28 Of map maKers
bot-central 2020-09-25 09:17:49 But yes Rick is getting a map team
bot-central 2020-09-25 11:53:55 This contest is for Puri

creations-chat 2020-09-28 01:46:31 That's an interesting suspension
creations-chat 2020-09-28 01:48:06 Looking at the suspension, it looks a bit like a dependent suspension
creations-chat 2020-09-28 01:48:39 Shit
creations-chat 2020-09-28 01:51:52 Honestly this is like bolting springs onto a solid axle
creations-chat 2020-09-28 01:52:42 Now I see it, looks like a solid axle with coil springs
creations-chat 2020-09-28 01:53:10 I dunno, I just wanna build my vehicles

<@!626449107577471012> I used a conveyor drive as afterburner speed, it's stability during flight can be found in the way I designed it's wings
creations-chat 2020-10-22 22:51:59 If you want manuverability, consider using the minimal amount of wings possible while still being able to have to as level as a flight possible, use motor locking if needed, and of course use as much flaps or control surfaces as possible. Don't forget make the design simple to avoid physics throttling

creations-chat 2020-12-13 06:35:12 Where's the build, I wanna put in some input
creations-chat 2020-12-13 06:42:01 Looking at the private jet, everything is wrong there.

Firstly, the size is too small to have any actual details, I suggest you upscale it so that you can add details, and speaking of size, that couldn't carry any passengers viably so that's also another reason to upscale it/make it larger.

If you're gonna make it larger, give it an actual nose. The wings should be more of a swept wing instead of a delta wing, it's gonna go supersonic anyways.

As for the body shape, I suggest you look up a bunch of private jets to see what they all have in common. I suggest looking at the Gulfstream family of jets, the Cessna Citation, Dassault Falcon. If you want something slightly larger like a regional jet, try the Mitsubishi SpaceJet, the Sukhoi Superjet or the Airbus A220/Bombardier C-Series
<@!342402058994974730>
creations-chat 2020-12-13 06:44:05 Anyways that's all I could think up of for criticisms about that jet, and slayertazer, I recommend you do research about aircraft also so people don't gang up against you like this
creations-chat 2020-12-13 06:46:39 In that case

- Use swept wings instead of delta wings. Delta wings only work on supersonic aircraft
- Place those horizontal tail fins on motor 2s, they're called elevators for a reason.
- Use a pyramid wedge for a nose instead of a cutter

But honestly, people still won't like it. It just makes it *slightly less* worse. If you want upvotes you gotta make a new plane
creations-chat 2020-12-13 06:55:47 <@!342402058994974730> For the motor 2s, well, go figure it out since I can't really take a good look. The motors 2s though moves the wings so they'll act like control surfaces. Custom control surfaces are better both in appaerance and performance

Also, here's some jets I recommend you to research. They're called very light jets
- Honda HA-420 HondaJet
- Cessna Citation M2 or Citation Mustang
- Embraer Phenom 500

Here's an example of one https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/23/HondaJet_Ryabtsev.jpg
(Anyways, gonna be a bit busy so go ask someone else for advice)

This is about the Yak-38, specifically the wings in general. Something's clearly wrong
creations-chat 2021-01-06 12:46:09 Don't forget the delta wings. For the main wing use 1x1 delta wing panels for the leading edge and 1x4 wing panels for the trailing edge, for the tail, use about a single 1x4 delta wing panel (adjust accordingly) for the trailing edge

creations-chat 2021-01-19 06:49:22 - Weird concave nose, make it convex
- Looks fat
- Weird exhaust, you forgot the intakes
- Go take a look at some pictures of the F/A-18. You also use questionable design choices such as using a (quarter sized) half wedge instead of a half triangle wedge for the canopy

https://drawingdatabase.com/mcdonnell-douglas-fa-18-hornet/ Here's a blueprint to help you fix this honestly horrible looking thing

Also, redo everything. Everything is wrong

This is just a joke. <@!737604371470090290>
creations-chat 2021-01-19 06:56:42 A joke is still a joke

It breaks every rule in making aircraft/spacecraft, delete and do better. It's actual 💩.
creations-chat 2021-01-19 06:58:54 There are fighter jets in this game that can go 10,000 while being unnaturally highly maneuverable

You just made what is essentially a fat private jet that's even more basic than the starter plane.
creations-chat 2021-01-19 07:01:22 Don't bother submitting to <#384025409945337856>, you're just gonna get downvote bombed until you start building something that's actually decent.
creations-chat 2021-01-19 07:03:57 The bottom half is fine

When you look at the top half, I see a poorly decorated Christmas tree
creations-chat 2021-01-19 07:09:01 Doesn't matter if you can make bobux or not

The real deal is if you can farm bobux from undes. The cheapskate ways are better than those who pay for everything
creations-chat 2021-01-19 07:12:47 That's good, because then you'd get bobux without actually paying for them. They pay you to get bobux
creations-chat 2021-01-19 22:43:13 I gotta agree with BobJohson.

Magnets are buggy to work with. Motor locking doesn't really affect blocks directly

As for the lens part, ask them. All I know is that it's clever manipulation of the way glass is rendered
creations-chat 2021-01-26 04:52:18 Looking at your F-15, the shaders look nice but the aircraft itself kinda feels incomplete. Like it feels it could be done a bit better in some areas
creations-chat 2021-01-27 02:34:13 Ah yes, the grandfather of all M3s

the-dump 2021-03-29 03:24:32 I've learned the file size of Rust code is fucking huge
the-dump 2021-03-29 03:24:49 C# is much smaller than Rust code in terms of storage size
the-dump 2021-03-29 03:25:03 C#'s a pretty solid language anyways
the-dump 2021-03-29 03:25:33 With the beauty of garbage collection™️ also
the-dump 2021-03-30 05:52:44 Something's different
the-dump 2021-03-30 06:14:08 why yes the text has been scrubbed
the-dump 2021-03-30 06:14:34 it's so blurry we thought you scrubbed it clean
the-dump 2021-03-31 09:30:32 
the-dump 2021-04-01 13:34:09 ah yes, it's a funny friday
the-dump 2021-04-01 13:34:21 Funny Friday Spooky Month
the-dump 2021-04-02 12:42:05 To Rick, work...
the-dump 2021-04-03 10:41:59 Pokemon: Human Edition
the-dump 2021-04-03 14:30:14 Spiderman
the-dump 2021-04-03 14:32:07 Oh this?

**O w O**
the-dump 2021-04-03 14:32:27 I'd just get every form of cosplay costume and burn it for fuel
the-dump 2021-04-03 14:32:52 Doesn't matter which fandom. Furry, anime, comic, all of it is fuel
the-dump 2021-04-03 14:33:17 There, now everyone is ***h a p p e***
the-dump 2021-04-03 14:33:21 **:>**
the-dump 2021-04-03 14:34:22 I don't even know why I stay here when I haven't even played Plane Crazy in a long time
the-dump 2021-04-03 14:36:00 I have a new home anyways
the-dump 2021-04-03 14:36:47 Because I'm dabbling around with some programming languages
the-dump 2021-04-03 14:36:57 I also live in the Microsoft Community Discord nowadays
the-dump 2021-04-03 14:37:10 Mostly interested within Lua, Python, C# and *maybe* F#
the-dump 2021-04-03 14:37:41 I'm too lazy to leave
the-dump 2021-04-03 14:40:33 I shall instead give you the funni

the-dump 2021-04-10 02:43:58 hmmyes
the-dump 2021-04-10 02:45:28 I used a hex editor to break the file
the-dump 2021-04-10 02:45:38 So I can force you to view it using a hex editor
the-dump 2021-04-10 02:49:12 Was the princess hella ugly?
the-dump 2021-04-10 02:49:29 Especially in personality
the-dump 2021-04-10 02:49:58 I'll just go back to learning 🅱️ython
the-dump 2021-04-10 02:52:39 Rickrolled :)
the-dump 2021-04-10 02:52:54 I am funni
the-dump 2021-04-10 02:53:11 A little creative even
the-dump 2021-04-10 02:54:55 Btw there's a funny number at the end I added
the-dump 2021-04-10 02:55:10 Two funny numbers actually
the-dump 2021-04-10 02:55:52 I think I'll go make use a hex editor more
the-dump 2021-04-10 02:55:58 For rickrolling
the-dump 2021-04-10 02:56:16 I just use a VS Code extension
the-dump 2021-04-10 03:05:21 
the-dump 2021-04-16 08:15:14 I'm still an abomination
the-dump 2021-04-16 08:15:43 ur mom's an abomination
the-dump 2021-04-16 08:16:01 hell everyone
the-dump 2021-04-16 08:16:20 everyone goes down, we must do the communism
the-dump 2021-04-17 04:32:32 The answer is to not be depressed
