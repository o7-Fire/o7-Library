plane-crazy 2020-07-31 15:53:20 Is flying grenade less ugly than flying Volvo?
plane-crazy 2020-07-31 15:53:10 
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 09:40:36 I used locked motors
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 09:40:16 No it didn't make it more stable
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 09:38:58 I gave one motor an arm, it becomes more stable
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 09:37:25 Like it wants to dance
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 09:37:17 It wobbles
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 09:35:34 I'm having trouble doing thrust vectoring
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 06:22:46 Well, I'm gonna record me losing my shit over at <#478584971670454284>
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 06:19:21 Does anyone know the game Bioshock?
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 06:15:39 But still makes for good OOC content
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 06:15:34 Unfortunately no
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 06:15:02 haha funni
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 06:12:04 fuck it I'm gonna make my aircraft larger just to fit a damn twin engine with thrust vectoring
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 06:05:06 Excuse me while I go copy someone's homework
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 06:00:50 West Germany's Dornier Do 31, an early VTOL jet transport aircraft
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 06:00:17 <@!551573378662662145> Okay here's a more serious suggestion
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dornier_Do_31
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 05:59:00 <@!551573378662662145> Make the flying Mazda known as the Boeing X-32
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 05:58:34 I am hopelessly ambitious :>
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 05:58:19 I wanna implement double thrust vectored engines
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 05:57:46 But still curved
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 05:57:43 I'm gonna make the air intakes bigger
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 05:57:14 I can make them work but not look good
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 05:57:01 The fact that I look up at others builds really means I'm bad at planes
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 05:56:11 <@456226577798135808> You called?
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 05:55:56 I guess I'm just asleep when they're awake
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 05:55:29 Wait there's a Protogen here
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 05:53:03 ***n y o o o m***
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 05:52:18 Anyways, time to experiment in not making a flying Volvo

plane-crazy 2020-07-30 05:50:06 As you can see, I took cues from the Ford GT at the back
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 05:49:57 car is car and I just decided to mix and mash parts
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 05:49:21 
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 05:49:20 Here's the final result
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 05:48:22 It's not *that* hard once I have *some* experience, right? ðŸ‘€ðŸ’¦
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 05:47:18 In a plane at least
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 05:47:06 I have yet to use motor locks in a way that doesn't give me a brainfuck
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 05:46:24 Something still looks off about this

plane-crazy 2020-07-30 05:45:27 <@!447221768520859659> Any tips when designing the body of a plane, right now I tried doing a design where I integrate the air intake as part of the body

plane-crazy 2020-07-30 05:37:25 just feet

plane-crazy 2020-07-30 05:17:03 Tell me what's wrong with this while I eat lunch
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 05:16:31 Something doesn't look right about this
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 05:13:08 To get the color
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 05:13:05 Well, I'm just gonna do something
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 05:12:48 Btw, what's the color code of the sky?
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 05:12:29 <@456226577798135808> What if someone used that on the top of a plane?

plane-crazy 2020-07-30 05:04:13 <@!447304419332063262> Is that stereotype about not being durable false?
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 05:00:25 "Made in China"
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 05:00:11 I hate how my mouse wants to constantly die
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 04:53:25 I'm gonna go make a thrust vectored aircraft
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 04:50:30 I mean his name is "MinecraftProGamer_15"
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 04:47:40 I'm just gonna go look around in <#384025409945337856> to see what people think are good builds
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 04:38:17 They dampy
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 04:38:15 Yes, pistons exist
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 04:37:42 Because I saw someone did that
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 04:37:34 Is it possible to make a suspension, without the suspension block itself?
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 03:35:29 Mine is just "fuck it, anything goes ~~send help I seek validation from <#384025409945337856>~~"
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 03:33:17 Ah, this exactly describes my brain at the moment https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/001/318/758/bbe.png
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 03:31:46 In another dive into plane design

plane-crazy 2020-07-30 03:29:48 Well, I can't think up of anything for that
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 03:26:24 But... *looks over at moderators*
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 03:26:15 I wanted to make a joke out of that
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 03:24:20 Ah, that's why your name sounded familiar
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 03:23:47 <@!429826358827417601> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AHNCWMiIV5Q
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 03:22:59 Wait, suspension
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 03:22:42 Why does the name Synth sound familiar
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 03:13:36 How do I design camo?
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 02:57:21 Because honestly I still feel like my planes are fugly
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 02:57:09 Give me examples of fighter jets so I can learn how to build good
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 02:42:31 Should I just go for a more subtle intake ramp?
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 02:42:05 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intake_ramp This is what I usually use
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 02:41:55 Well, at least that's what I expect people to react
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 02:41:33 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diverterless_supersonic_inlet This is ugly ngl
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 02:40:32 Well, give me ideas for air intakes
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 02:40:19 That too
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 02:39:47 So, current improvements I can make
- Appearance
- Stealth
- Weaponry
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 02:37:10 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yehudi_lights
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 02:36:51 With yehudi lights
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 02:36:47 Once I learn how to make camo
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 02:36:42 Sky camo on bottom
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 02:36:38 Ground camo on top
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 02:36:32 I'm gonna take a break and make a fighter jet

plane-crazy 2020-07-30 02:29:38 Wait boomerang
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 02:29:31 I wonder how it'd fly though
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 02:28:28 Exploding ananas
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 02:28:10 Make them exploding pineapples
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 02:27:21 Anyways, I'm gonna attempt to please the builder gods of this server by building what I said
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 02:26:20 Stealth aircraft are sharp
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 02:25:57 > those sharp curves
ðŸ‘€
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 02:22:43 I feel like I can definitely place a plane inside
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 02:22:37 9 blocks wide and 10 blocks tall inside
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 02:21:15 If a plane was a Volvo
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 02:19:49 Because screw it I've already wasted too much time
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 02:19:34 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drnxZlS9gyw ***I'll make this then, slap a camo and call it a day***
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 02:19:12 Or are they considered separate things
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 02:18:58 <@!335599526414909451> What about parasite fighters inside of the plane? Are they part of a build?
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 02:18:41 Ah fuck it I'm gonna try anyways
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 02:17:41 Wait even the parasite fighters inside?
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 02:17:24 What about mini planes?
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 02:17:15 Does a bomber's bombs count as part of a creation
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 02:17:06 Pure
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 02:16:36 wait purified's here
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 02:15:43 And have spent too much time onto it
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 02:15:37 No I meant I literally made it
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 02:15:22 
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 02:14:44 Like way too far into it
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 02:14:37 I already made the jet
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 02:14:13 I kinda wanted to give <#627195143040139264> a shot ngl
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 02:13:32 <@!335599526414909451>Does a bomber's bombs count as part of a creation or not? I was thinking of converting my jumbo jet into a bomber. What about carrying vehicles inside, such as this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drnxZlS9gyw
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 02:00:34 <@!363742162757877761> That did not age well didn't it?
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 02:00:04 By being honest
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 01:59:57 Volvo actually marketed this way
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 01:57:50 Ah, every vehicle I made https://i.pinimg.com/originals/ec/98/44/ec9844f7adc78b5ca767816c575d25e1.png
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 01:54:20 Wedge, then taller wedge
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 01:53:47 I'll go curve it like this
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 01:50:39 So it's gonna be more flat at the bottom
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 01:50:34 Knowing my plane though, the landing gear is gonna affect it's curviness
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 01:50:08 For now though my priorities is to make the plane less boxy
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 01:49:30 Or that one Boeing 747 aircraft carrier
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 01:49:22 Well, if I manage to get 4000 blocks without the interior, I might try an attempt at HoF by converting my jumbo jet into a bomber
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 01:46:12 So, out of curiosity, how does one get into the HoF?
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 01:45:27 Wait for what reason?
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 01:44:26 I also see Prototrode was once in this server
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 01:42:30 And I'm proud xp
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 01:42:27 Someone made a Waluigi mech
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 01:41:29 Gonna look up some planes in <#627195143040139264>
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 00:53:49 <@163143541160148992> If that's yours, make it poop little trains like a spider
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 00:52:19 These are blursed
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 00:52:07 <@163143541160148992> What word is best used when something's both funny and horrifying, the closest I can come up to is blursed
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 00:48:34 Imagine going in PvP and seeing that
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 00:48:19 Thomas The Train is cursed
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 00:48:04 No make Uranus
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 00:47:05 Or make a furry mech, seeing how the community here reacts xp
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 00:46:34 That should be cursed
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 00:46:29 The ***OWO***mobile
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 00:37:47 That looks too familiar
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 00:37:26 <@163143541160148992> Have I seen you before in that ship?
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 00:36:58 Fokker
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 00:36:54 <@551573378662662145> Fok you then
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 00:35:12 Has anyone ever made a pun out of Fokker
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 00:34:25 I'm not really into helicopters tbh
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 00:33:48 Autocorrected
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 00:33:26 ~~I also have no clue what a swash plate is~~
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 00:33:00 ***what is that monstrosity?***
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 00:32:44 And place a counter rotating motor below
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 00:32:18 I just make the same motor rotate opposite facing propelles blades
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 00:29:42 Try that, searching if Germany has any interesting WW2 aircraft, whether it be plans, prototypes or something produced in small numbers
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 00:28:34 Germany has experimental jet aircraft right?
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 00:28:19 Wait
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 00:28:11 I honestly am running out of ideas
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 00:27:28 Oof, ekranoplans? That was built during the Soviet Union but I'm not sure if it was ever used in WW2 or not
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 00:26:26 I dunno either, try searching experimental aircraft
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 00:13:27 And that was the most simplest out of all them
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 00:13:03 Flying car has 7 - 26
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 00:12:19 Because that feels like the easiest way to find downvotes
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 00:12:05 I'm gonna search up flying car
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 00:10:52 Well, I saw a flying car that had no upvotes at all, only downvotes
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 00:02:20 I literally woke up minutes ago
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 00:01:53 I almost thought there was a random hole in the tonk, but then it was a barrel
plane-crazy 2020-07-29 12:26:13 How good or bad of an idea is that?
plane-crazy 2020-07-29 12:26:02 Boeing 747 bomber
plane-crazy 2020-07-29 12:23:51 ***g i v e***
plane-crazy 2020-07-29 11:59:44 Well, time to look at some Mikoyan, Sukhoi, Lockheed and Northrop(s) once I get back on
plane-crazy 2020-07-29 11:54:25 My current aircraft's 5 blocks wide
plane-crazy 2020-07-29 11:50:59 So slanted wings, avoid 1x2+
plane-crazy 2020-07-29 11:50:22 You sure I should remove them?
plane-crazy 2020-07-29 11:50:16 Oh, I use the canards as another flap
plane-crazy 2020-07-29 11:49:29 My internet connection's lagging
plane-crazy 2020-07-29 11:49:25 And here's the start of another project
plane-crazy 2020-07-29 11:49:08 ***A h h L a g***
plane-crazy 2020-07-29 11:49:08 
plane-crazy 2020-07-29 11:49:07 
plane-crazy 2020-07-29 11:48:47 Well, here's the one I recently finished
plane-crazy 2020-07-29 11:47:13 Well, I'm gonna show the recently finished one and the replacement for it
plane-crazy 2020-07-29 11:42:40 Even if it means designing a slightly larger one
plane-crazy 2020-07-29 11:42:27 I wanna improve on the looks of my current fighter jet
plane-crazy 2020-07-29 11:42:14 Can the great builders of this server bless me the knowledge of how to actually build something that looks good
plane-crazy 2020-07-29 09:11:24 Well, the next goal is to get the highest aero rank or improve in another rank
plane-crazy 2020-07-29 09:10:48 I was blue before, and I became blue again
plane-crazy 2020-07-29 09:10:11 Bacc to blue xp
plane-crazy 2020-07-29 09:07:57 Oh neat I got Aero Rank V
plane-crazy 2020-07-29 09:07:43 Back
plane-crazy 2020-07-29 04:07:14 Aight, I'mma head off, might bbl
plane-crazy 2020-07-29 04:06:11 At least in my experience on Twitter
plane-crazy 2020-07-29 04:05:54 Both those who just wanna enjoy it and those who just want clout and less SFW stuff
plane-crazy 2020-07-29 04:05:35 <@!435946988559925248> Understandable, and I've seen both sides
plane-crazy 2020-07-29 04:03:55 Even though I often appear here in the chat
plane-crazy 2020-07-29 04:03:45 Well, it was fun seeing how people reacted to me being a furry
plane-crazy 2020-07-29 04:02:41 I'm surprised I've managed to not get comments about me
plane-crazy 2020-07-29 04:02:20 Scalies
plane-crazy 2020-07-29 04:01:37 How have you people not noticed that?
plane-crazy 2020-07-29 04:01:11 > More bulgy
You know the rules but I don't

***O W O What's this?***
plane-crazy 2020-07-29 04:00:35 Ah, so like the fighter equivalent of those sports cars/supercars that have "backseats"
plane-crazy 2020-07-29 04:00:06 1.5?
plane-crazy 2020-07-29 03:54:19 Really loses control at 1200
plane-crazy 2020-07-29 03:53:50 I lost control beyond 1000, I feel like I might've broken something
plane-crazy 2020-07-29 03:53:26 plane afterburner
plane-crazy 2020-07-29 03:47:51 <@456226577798135808> Aeromorphs.

That's the only answer I have
plane-crazy 2020-07-29 03:17:25 Wait no it goes up to 2100
plane-crazy 2020-07-29 03:16:49 And at speed 25, it gets to speeds up to 1000 while having not enough of a pitching issue relative to the speed I'm gaining
plane-crazy 2020-07-29 03:16:02 Like imagine the plane is facing like this <. well the conveyor drive faces the opposite direction, like this (1 = conveyor, 2 = piston)

1 2
><
plane-crazy 2020-07-29 03:14:23 Somehow it makes it more stable, while also reducing but not completely getting rid of the pitching issue
plane-crazy 2020-07-29 03:13:29 *The reverse mounted conveyor drives were a significant part of making a stable afterburner*
plane-crazy 2020-07-29 03:10:52 I swear if that's what's making it work, i cri
plane-crazy 2020-07-29 03:10:38 Hmm, I noticed a mounted the conveyor drive afterburner in reverse
plane-crazy 2020-07-29 03:09:51 With a bit Saab Gripen applied to the back
plane-crazy 2020-07-29 03:09:24 Started with a F-35 Lightning II, then sorta drifted towards the Sukhoi Su-33
plane-crazy 2020-07-29 03:08:52 Oh, well I just experiment around and see what works, as well as taking cues from existing aircraft
plane-crazy 2020-07-29 03:08:05 Build like who?
plane-crazy 2020-07-29 03:07:50 <@!724461096349728824> Wait who?
plane-crazy 2020-07-29 03:06:22 The new one however, it just wants to die when I use the conveyor drive as an after burner
plane-crazy 2020-07-29 03:06:07 The old one, it can even use it as a main engine with minimal pitching issues
plane-crazy 2020-07-29 03:05:44 I'm still confused as to how I'd fix this afterburner issue
plane-crazy 2020-07-29 03:04:30 Old
plane-crazy 2020-07-29 03:04:26 New
plane-crazy 2020-07-29 03:02:48 It can't use afterburners reliably anymore
plane-crazy 2020-07-29 03:02:40 Tested my new fighter jet
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 15:06:20 It's 11 PM
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 15:06:15 Oof
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 15:05:28 Well, good luck because VTOL in tight spaces isn't what I'd say is easy
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 15:04:07 From what I see, you're gonna need a lot of wedges for this plane
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 15:03:49 Probably busy
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 15:03:18 I'm guessing they're AFK, when you said 'alive'
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 15:02:07 This it?
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 15:02:04 https://acecombat.fandom.com/wiki/ADF-01_FALKEN
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 15:00:25 Well, I'll try both
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 15:00:05 Google's saying Falken Jet
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 14:59:54 Oh I was searching it up
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 14:59:01 ?
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 14:57:59 Like the Shinano but modern
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 14:57:48 Now I'm imagining a sub carrying parasite fighters (mini fighter jets)
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 14:56:51 That's big
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 14:56:26 My planes usually involve variable incidence
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 14:56:08 Well, in that case I can't enter xp
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 14:55:10 Some might have folding wings, some will go for variable sweep and some can't even reduce the space they take up
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 14:54:40 Well, I don't have experience with water vehicles of any form 

For plane locking, well you gotta acknowledge everyone designs their plane differently
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 14:52:15 Reduced width from 7 to 5, consequence being a twin engine is no longer possible and that there'll be only a single rudder 

Made it more curved in appearance, imagine F-35 Lightning II but has the top shaved off a bit and has box scoops (F-14 Tomcat for example) at the side that curves into the body 

Wing setup will mostly be the same, apart from said single rudder and new elevators 

Made it a single seater so no rando can actually ride it
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 14:45:17 Improving on my fighter jet again
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 13:19:26 Return to inside human
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 13:19:22 <@!645128367611445248> You return to cell
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 13:19:04 XD
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 13:07:03 What's even funnier is that he literally only has a fighter jet to show off
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 13:06:49 But ***w i d e***
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 13:06:38 Yes, it's boxy
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 13:06:30 I just need to improve pitching and it'll fly well
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 13:06:19 Here it is unfolded
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 13:05:09 The *jumbo* jet
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 13:04:41 By whipping out the airliner
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 13:04:34 So I put him in his place
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 13:04:31 Some rando named pyhywong calling people noobs
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 09:01:59 <@287459677611098114> Boeing X-32 but it's on land
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 09:00:39 <@723419054114865202> Leave this chat unless this crap entertains you 

I'm already tired of it
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 08:59:28 Well, goodbye
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 08:57:31 (These two really remind me of Twitter ngl)
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 08:57:00 So better not waste time
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 08:56:54 This isn't gonna stop until one is tired
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 08:56:08 Here's an unwritten rule of the Internet 

If you two keep arguing just stop and block
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 08:55:04 I wanna see big clock on Big Ben
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 08:54:47 Mr. Bean
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 08:54:17 A small fighter jet isn't hard to build, plus it'll teach you the importance of motor 2
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 08:52:04 Here's an easy project, build a fighter jet
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 08:51:37 I'll go do stupid stuff
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 08:51:10 Though aircraft has worked out best for me
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 08:50:59 I like planes and cars
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 08:50:34 Though I'll reduce the quality of my suspension to fit in more weaponry
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 08:50:01 Okay, I'll do that then
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 08:49:22 Hmm, should I build a custom armored combat vehicke?
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 08:48:04 Alexa's nice, though privacy concerns apply to me
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 08:47:13 Your crack
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 08:46:57 They're not gonna give you VTOL if you don't show them VTOL
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 08:46:25 But for some vehicles, you need proof
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 08:45:53 It's a semi, the one with the chonky hood
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 08:45:35 I mean I literally just sent a picture of my truck and I got a rank
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 08:45:19 Depends
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 08:44:58 If you want a rank
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 08:44:53 Just make sure the mods can see it
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 08:43:45 Even Aero Engineer 1's good enough
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 08:43:31 Aight, apply for a rank
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 08:42:57 Discord has file size limitations
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 08:42:36 Submit a ticket

plane-crazy 2020-07-28 08:41:50 Read <#705941616199991307>
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 08:41:11 That white really is off-putting
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 08:41:04 Oh
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 08:40:46 Then apply for a rank
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 08:40:31 Read it again, slowly
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 08:40:09 Both of you two are noobs, it's not that hard to apply for a rank
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 08:37:07 This chat is becoming annoying
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 08:36:11 Is it worth going onto PvP?
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 08:35:56 Well, guess I should experiment
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 08:35:37 <@456226577798135808> What's the RGB?
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 08:33:54 If I ever go PvP
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 08:33:45 And now I wanna apply that
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 08:33:35 I saw what Jay did
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 08:33:26 What's the RGB code of the grass?
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 07:44:42 Roblox is r/kidsarefuckingstupid in a nutshell
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 07:43:44 That's how failure looks like
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 07:43:23 That definitely looks like a bunch of kids given access to the chat
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 07:42:28 "prees grean butten"

Pri's Grian Butt EN?
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 07:41:24 Dangerous but there''s gold
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 07:41:19 Dang, PvP looks like a gold mine
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 07:37:32 So that's all
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 07:37:24 Roblox failed me
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 07:33:22 Have fun reading
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 07:33:17 
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 07:29:57 I'm gonna screenshot the convo for the meme
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 07:29:11 Not even uncommon
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 07:29:02 The Philippines is Catholic yet being gay isn't rare here
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 07:28:19 Honestly fr though I have no problems with actual gay people
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 07:27:31 So I said "That's because I am"
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 07:27:16 And then they lowered in quality even further, "your a potato"
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 07:27:05 My comeback was "I thought that was your mom"
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 07:26:32 "THIS AIRLINE BUILDER IS BEING GAY"
boy they went silent the moment I made a comeback
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 07:07:13 Makes a business jet

plane-crazy 2020-07-28 07:06:54 This exists https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honda_Jet
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 07:00:54 For cars I use both
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 07:00:43 For tank steering I just use two regular motors
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 06:33:15 Smoke pipe are one of the blocks you get without a pass
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 06:32:38 Oh, I use rocket engines
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 06:21:12 I wonder if a friend of mine is online
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 06:20:54 Well, I guess I'll have to build my own trees then
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 06:08:14 And more like a one way thin road
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 06:08:05 Except I make it less race track
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 06:07:32 Now I'm using Maple Valley Raceway as a reference
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 06:07:25 I see funnel there
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 05:51:36 He's in the same server as me
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 05:51:32 Should I show a surprise for iSuspension?

plane-crazy 2020-07-28 05:41:29 Wait it doesn't break the rules?
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 05:40:44 <@!447221768520859659> "[2] Plane must use only wings to fly (i.e, don't use engines to control the pitch of the plane)."
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 05:39:59 That's why I use canards
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 05:39:51 Thrust vectoring*

Canards also help
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 05:39:17 I would put vector thrusting but that breaks the rules in <#609442446249820211>

plane-crazy 2020-07-28 05:31:41 Where nobody gives a shit
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 05:31:36 Like just to release frustration, even if it goes into the void
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 05:31:19 I wonder if we should have a venting channel, to vent about the upvotes and downvotes
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 05:30:13 Just make shitposts and I might get upvotes
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 05:29:58 To getting upvotes
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 05:29:56 That's the answer

plane-crazy 2020-07-28 05:25:20 Should I go do that
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 05:25:08 Just slap America's flag there and you'll get upvoted to heck
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 05:25:00 Ah yes
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 05:24:24 Then I'll go build Skinner's house for the sake of ***S t e a m e d H a m s***
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 05:24:09 But hey, if people want memes
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 05:23:40 It's either no fold or 1.5 fold
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 05:23:25 Most airliners in this game barely get to 2 folds
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 05:23:08 <@456226577798135808> https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/384025409945337856/737219878666371152 I'm wondering how I got 27 downvotes for making a fucking three fold jumbo jet actually fly competently
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 05:22:01 Let me just grab the link to the last downvote bomb
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 05:21:45 Downvote bombing, I'm too familiar with that
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 05:21:40 Because paint is life
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 05:18:31 But what can you do, people be like that
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 05:18:07 People are weird
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 05:17:43 And send it to <#384025409945337856>
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 05:17:34 Would it be a good idea to build Skinner's house? (Steamed Hams meme)
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 05:12:04 Or something outdoorsy
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 05:11:57 Trying to get mountain road vibes
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 05:11:47 With a mix of dirt and stuff
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 05:11:43 I'll just do slate for the road
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 05:10:22 Which looks better as a road (not highway, but somewhere like in a mountain pass)

Slate or cobblestone?

plane-crazy 2020-07-28 03:56:55 That only Innov. Inc game I played is this
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 03:54:17 Eh screw it I'll just search on YT
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 03:53:50 Trying to find the duck meme on the clipboard
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 03:53:10 Did I hear duck?
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 03:53:02 Duck?
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 03:49:35 And other negative comments about typical favorites of our naive zoomers
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 03:49:14 You know, I wonder how people in PvP would react to ForkNut
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 03:48:00 ^
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 03:47:32 We live in a society
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 03:47:22 Well, I hope you're ready to deal with raging 12 year olds
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 03:46:04 <@506566804508770315> I mean what did you expect 

Shredder bug users are the equivalent of trolls
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 03:44:25 The only reason I don't use PvP
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 03:44:19 Ah, shredder bugs
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 03:41:45 But the other...
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 03:41:38 Well, I've got one part right
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 03:38:07 <@!447221768520859659> So, *how* important are looks in this server?
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 03:37:12 And I feel like I should focus on making things look good rather than function only
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 03:36:41 I'm just gonna look at the box art of Forza and try making up scenery for it https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forza_Horizon_4
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 03:34:50 I'll just let someone else answer it
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 03:34:41 As for damping, I'm too tired to think about it
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 03:34:08 0% is the equivalent of having no suspension
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 03:33:33 Stiffness, well it's how stiff the suspension is

Think of this, a softer spring is easier to compress than say a stiffer spring
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 03:31:54 
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 03:30:26 
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 03:29:57 Though I may have taken a bit of styling cues from the Ford GT, mainly with the dual exhaust
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 03:29:35 TVR, Zenvo, Gumpert, those kind of cars
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 03:29:20 So I decided to make one of those chonky European supercars
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 03:29:10 Well, I didn't want a tutorial Lamborghini
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 03:28:23 I'm gonna take a screenshot at night
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 03:28:20 
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 03:27:48 Oh wait I forgot what I was gonna use this for
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 03:27:08 I'm gonna screenshot something
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 03:27:04 Give me an idea for scenery
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 03:11:07 I"ll go look at some screenshots from Forza
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 02:49:14 That was just motivational blow
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 02:49:06 Especially after that mass downvoting
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 02:48:59 I don't even wanna give a shit anymore about it
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 02:48:39 And that
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 02:47:40 Eh, this doesn't look good anyways
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 02:46:43 It has no purpose other than firing stuff
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 02:46:32 I'm gonna go delete this to make room for other stuff
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 02:45:30 Now I know how Fiat's designer felt about it xd
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 02:44:51 This quote from the Wikipedia page accurately describes how people felt about it at the time

"The tragedy of the Multipla is that its Elephant Man esque exterior enclosed a genuinely clever and spacious interior, and it wasnâ€™t bad to drive, either. Itâ€™s a shame, then, that youâ€™d rather walk than be seen in it."
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 02:44:04 Yes, this is modern art
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 02:43:54 <@456226577798135808> I mean there's this from the page

"The exterior and interior design of the Multipla were displayed at the Museum of Modern Art (MOMA) in New York during its "Different Roads â€“ Automobiles for the Next Century" exhibition in 1999"
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 02:42:29 Like the only reason it failed was because of how it looks
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 02:42:19 The successor to this is the Fiat 500L
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 02:42:08 The Fiat Multipla
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 02:41:23 Just look at this thing
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 02:41:16 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiat_Multipla
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 02:40:42 Everytime I build, I should remind myself the Fiat Multipla exists
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 02:40:19 Good features, everything went downhill though because of the looks
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 02:40:07 <@!447221768520859659> Wait that's the Fiat Multipla in a nutshell
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 02:38:57 Fuck it I'm just gonna build that car
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 02:38:17 <@!447221768520859659> I don't know how to feel about this, you're correct yet I wanna deny this for my own sake
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 02:37:14 Actually, thinking about it
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 02:36:49 Like what do I need to be a damn 5 year old and sneeze colors onto a boxy thing
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 02:35:42 <@!626512383287754763> I agree with you on this one
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 02:34:47 I don't get what you people want from me https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/384025409945337856/737219878666371152
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 08:22:39 
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 08:22:27 wait there's an actual mad engine
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 08:20:34 mad engine?
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 08:18:44 <@!551573378662662145> I feel like I need to relax for now
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 08:18:20 so I can commit c a l m
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 08:18:11 I'm gonna go offline now
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 08:17:09 I wanna know what people think, maybe a little bit too much
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 08:16:51 <#504436696021204992> I am awaiting for anyone
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 08:14:22 oof I forgot <#504436696021204992> exists
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 08:13:38 <@!551573378662662145> I'm too lazy for inventor rank so I just stick with builds
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 08:12:49 There, made the font in bold
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 08:12:20 <@!446205377604878336> oof, maybe I should put emphasis on the video
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 08:08:57 <#384025409945337856> Here's a demonstration of my jumbo jet in action
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 08:03:40 Then I place a body on top of it
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 08:03:31 Literally just a backbone with suspension
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 08:03:23 https://www.ultimatecarpage.com/images/gallery/retromobile2008/Lotus-Backbone-Chassis-113051.jpg

Ah, this is exactly how I do the chassis of my cars
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 07:59:28 Literally just textureless polygons in the sky
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 07:59:21 Oh, I became texture polygons
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 07:58:49 Oh, my game hasn't crashed yet
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 07:58:05 <@!725583147928125461> With glitches, you can
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 07:57:00 **Doctor:** "Meme doesn't exist, he can't hurt you"
**Meme:** *exists*
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 07:56:30 I mean it's just a meme, it's not like it's gonna hurt you
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 07:55:44 Jumbo jet works, just gonna upload it to Streamable
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 06:36:55 Discord ping
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 06:36:50 You know what I'd play if I had speakers in the game
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 06:36:07 Increase firepower
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 06:36:05 So basically
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 06:34:49 <@!287779983445721088> where is da wae
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 06:34:20 I'm just gonna color the celling of the 2nd floor
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 06:34:12 Actually it's too much work for me xp
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 06:32:39 And for the sake of giving it more personality
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 06:32:18 Well, I'm gonna give the 1st floor a different celling
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 06:31:54 I didn't notice my plane's 2nd floor was 4 blocks high
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 06:31:44 I just realized something
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 03:28:38 ***@â€‹rickje139***

plane-crazy 2020-07-27 03:28:16 well, after this
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 03:28:05 Anyways, I gotta go work on my stuff, see y'all later
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 03:27:55 aw rick didn't notice me
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 03:27:09 Hey Rick look at this @â€‹rickje139

plane-crazy 2020-07-27 03:25:09 â€‹
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 03:25:06 I think I accidentally tricked him because of this character
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 03:24:22 I was just messing around and I didn't expect this mess to happen xp
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 03:23:50 @â€‹Jailbreakius
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 03:22:49 <@!447221768520859659> Zero width space @â€‹99eryaydude
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 03:22:00 @â€‹rickje139
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 03:21:49 <@456226577798135808> No seriously a zero width character exists
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 03:21:40 XD dang I didn't expect everyone to try doing it
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 03:20:51 Rick's not gonna be happy with that ghost ping xp
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 03:20:42 <@!658774365261004801> I just searched up the character and copied it, then inserted it between the @ and username
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 03:20:17 Copy it
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 03:20:08 â€‹
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 03:19:56 That exists
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 03:19:50 I used a zero width space
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 03:19:46 XD
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 03:19:27 If the clue's not enough

||Zero Width Space||, here's one below
â€‹
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 03:18:55 Here's the clue

||Invisible characters||
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 03:18:21 Need a clue?

@â€‹purifiedwater14
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 03:17:25 I dare you do it
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 03:17:08 *Guys look*

@â€‹rickje139
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 03:15:30 ***E x p a n d e d D e f a u l t M a p***
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 03:14:19 I want some references
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 03:14:16 I'm gonna go search up pictures of the Boeing 747-8 VIP's interior, as well as their Airbus competitor
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 03:13:21 <@!658774365261004801> Dang Minecraft back then must be really efficient with that 64 KB of memory, if we assume everyone's using a Commodore 64 back then
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 03:10:47 I just woke up and forgot that Math exists
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 03:09:32 Wait someone played for that long
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 03:08:12 <@!658774365261004801> That also sounds like someone in either the furry or anime fandom would say, and I dunno if that makes it worse or not
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 03:07:01 <#478584971670454284> I'm just gonna wait
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 03:04:34 Any ideas what the interior of a private jumbo jet (like the Boeing 747-8 VIP) would look like? Or are they literally just flying houses?
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 12:14:40 Crappy Philippine ISP + Having Discord and Roblox up
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 12:14:12 Anyways, I'm lagging now
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 12:02:54 Like why would people choose to not have clothes
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 12:02:38 It's just those that are literally skin is what weird for me
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 12:02:11 But in a game like this it's normal for me
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 12:01:58 They're just weird
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 12:01:47 Roblox avatars in a nutshell
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 12:00:33 I usually just blacklist if they approach too close
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 11:56:36 For some bizarre reason I also notice this more often on Korean servers
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 11:55:40 Literally
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 11:55:39 The weirdest kind of avatars on Plane Crazy are the ones that are all skin
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 11:55:25 Random thought
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 10:29:23 exactly
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 10:28:27 Arrest me
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 10:28:24 <@283153622496182274> It's blursed
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 10:27:51 That has the same energy as "it's big brain time"
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 10:26:48 (I like Portal, and it looked nice so I sticked with grey, blue and orange)
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 10:25:56 Alongside blue and orange
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 10:25:28 Well, grey's already my typical color scheme
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 10:24:59 Keep it simple, and the colors not like a five year old sneezed on it
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 10:24:33 Though I should probably try not to go too overboard
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 10:24:12 Plain white is bland
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 10:24:08 Well, I'll go do it then
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 10:21:16 Would it make sense for a non-corporate, private jet to be painted?
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 10:20:22 A small question for me to ask
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 10:18:28 It's either fidget spinner or actual thrust
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 10:17:40 You know what I don't get, how it's a hit or miss if a conveyor drive becomes buggy or not
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 10:16:26 For now though, I'm taking a break
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 10:16:03 And bigger ailerons
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 10:15:47 I'm currently redesigning the wings to give it some huge flaps
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 10:14:26 The conveyor drive is the second main engine, which is located at the back
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 10:14:00 In the custom engines, there's of course a huge jet engine, with super rockets crammed in there
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 10:13:24 The plane has four wing mounted engines of a custom design
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 10:12:54 I kinda went for two main engines
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 10:12:27 <@287779983445721088> Is it fine to use a conveyor drive in combination with regular engines just to get a huge vehicle flying?
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 10:11:30 All I know it sometimes be like that
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 10:11:23 Oof, I don't even know
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 10:10:58 Somewhere near that
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 10:10:53 600
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 10:10:39 Once it got off the airport it got around 500
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 10:10:27 The conveyor drive at speed 18 was barely just enough
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 10:09:52 And even then the roll and pitch is pretty weak
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 10:09:39 Well, after using jet engines, rocket engines and a conveyor drive
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 10:08:50 I finally made the jumbo jet work
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 08:12:25 <@!283153622496182274> Yes

I mean it's still the same chassis
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 08:02:02 I wonder if it's tilting spoiler would have any effect at all in this game
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 08:01:29 I mean I could do something based on it but not exactly
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 08:00:38 Just felt it'd be easier to do chonky supercars
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 07:59:08 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zenvo_ST1
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 07:59:02 Well, Wikipedia only mentions it on the ST1
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 07:58:31 I mean there's also the ST1
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 07:57:32 Might use hover thrusters for headlights
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 07:57:26 It's gonna be 7 blocks wide
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 07:56:32 I feel like I might mess up the proportions
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 07:56:25 Well crap, I don't know how to build this car
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zenvo_TS1_GT
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 05:13:43 Well, have fun then
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 05:13:12 Oh, well if you want then sure
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 05:12:45 All I remember is helicarrier
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 05:12:29 <@369303015267631104> That reminds me of something in Marvel
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 04:38:31 I wonder if a tilting spoiler like the one on the Zenvo TSR-S would work or not
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 04:36:24 Well, the Ford Escort RS Cosworth anyways
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 04:36:03 Like it already came with a big spoiler
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 04:35:51 Because the Ford Escort has big spoilers
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 04:35:16 A Ford Escort/Ford Sierra
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 04:35:08 I know what I can turn into a drift car
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 04:32:14 Then congrats
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 04:32:12 If they actually landed a jet on top of a jet
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 04:26:57 idk why i made an off-roading bus
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 04:23:40 wait what happened
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 04:15:04 This chat has lost whatever made sense of it
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 04:12:47 I wonder how that flew past you
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 04:12:21 > <@!649695489553334314> I mean, I gotta fit that widebody double floor body somehow
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 04:12:01 fuck it i'm just gonnna delete the conveyor drives
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 04:10:27 While also minimizing block usage
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 04:10:09 <@!649695489553334314> I mean, I gotta fit that widebody double floor body somehow
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 04:09:42 The interior and rudder still hasn't been done yet
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 04:09:25 As you can see, a lot
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 04:08:28 I've used a lot of beams and 1x4 wing panels
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 04:07:36 Or trying to find a way to reduce lag
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 04:07:31 I still gotta solve the issue of the plane bugging out with conveyor drives
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 04:07:02 Well I guess I better be building that plane then xd
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 04:04:04 What command do I use to get color roles
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 04:03:55 So there's color roles
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 04:02:06 <@!287779983445721088> Tank has eyes
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 03:57:52 I wanna increase block count
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 03:57:47 Give me ideas what to place in this section of the bus
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 03:56:49 And I don't mind having lights during when it's dark
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 03:56:27 The fans on the computer I'm using has green lighting
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 03:56:13 I don't really think lighting is useless, but RGB isn't needed
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 03:55:26 What should I put in that empty space?
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 03:55:19 And one that has empty space
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 03:55:16 One that's full of seats
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 03:55:11 Hmm, the bus I made has two sections
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 03:54:12 wait no it's 699
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 03:53:55 I know my next submission is now
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 03:53:51 I just realized I have a bus with 900 blocks
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 03:52:21 I mean he's an expert aeronautical engineer ffs
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 03:52:12 I trust Savoic
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 03:50:57 Which size?
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 03:50:55 Well, if in case the conveyor drive bugs out again, then what about rocket engines?
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 03:50:09 Well, engine size
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 03:50:02 Also, what plane engine should I use for a Concorde like plane?
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 03:49:47 rip my pc
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 03:49:44 I guess I'll have to use regular engines then
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 03:49:29 The folds unfolded and it become a glorified fidget spinner
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 03:49:04 It glitched the heck out
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 03:48:56 I tried using conveyor engines in my jumbo jet
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 01:34:20 https://youtu.be/dkJOm1V77Xg Interesting vehicle
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 16:16:21 As another side project for fun crap
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 16:16:07 Scrolling up now I kinda wanna make a large projectile launcher for no reason
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 16:15:33 I forgot about that
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 16:15:28 ah yes motor lock
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 16:13:34 (But still)
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 16:13:29 (I mean I shouldn't be surprised given how buggy it is)
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 16:13:16 I saw it in <#384025409945337856>
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 16:13:05 <@446205377604878336> The heck you've made a suspension block not vertical
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 16:11:11 Anyways, I better stop talking when I'm still braindead
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 16:10:43 Being a lazy dumbass xp
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 16:10:35 Procrastinating
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 16:10:30 In bed
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 16:10:24 Yes that's what I've been doing all day
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 16:09:53 I'm gonna go get off this server for now 

I need ***s l e e p***
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 16:09:31 Shaky wing = trampoline deathtrap
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 16:09:11 Also, wings really are capable of flinging things
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 16:08:53 So make anything go ***n y o o o o m***
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 16:08:36 Fabric wing go ***n y o o o m***
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 16:08:11 Wing powered launchers
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 16:08:03 I have a dumb idea
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 16:07:37 I tried it with metal and it flew
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 16:07:25 Also, wings made out of any material go into the heavens
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 16:07:08 I'm just being a sleep deprived human being
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 16:06:36 idk, still up to them
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 16:06:23 Â¯\\_(ãƒ„)\_/Â¯
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 16:05:43 fair
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 16:05:28 Wait a second
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 16:04:36 XD
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 16:04:30 I mean I'm already a potato over here
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 16:03:44 Philippines
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 16:03:27 Actually yes I did forget
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 16:02:41 Living in S.E Asia, the languages/nationalities I commonly see are 

- Korean (quite common for me)
- Indonesian 
- Chinese 
- Japanese 
- English 
- My own kind
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 15:59:47 I'll go add rudder and elevators to my jumbo jet tonorrow
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 15:59:10 My lazy arse
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 15:58:51 Philippines
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 15:58:30 Why am I still awake it's 11:58 PM
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 15:57:36 The only thing I know is "haha plane go lift" with wings
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 15:56:12 How friendly is PC physics with giant planes?
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 15:55:05 I guess the only purpose would be confuse the heck out of others with that paint
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 15:54:31 Isnt the Berkut one of the few fighter jets with forward swept wings?
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 15:53:46 Reminds me of that one camo used one ships
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 15:53:37 That's one trippy camo
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 12:13:38 I mean it literally jumped out of existence
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 12:13:25 Way too much?
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 12:13:06 Well, I guess I'll just use regular wings then
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 12:12:53 o o f
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 12:12:07 But if there's something unique, then I'll use it
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 12:11:43 So I skipped over it
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 12:11:37 Honestly I thought it was a shitpost
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 12:11:10 <@!670939038999511041> Tell me more about these fabric panels
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 12:10:59 Also wait fabric panel?
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 12:10:47 I thought those were glass signs
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 12:09:45 How common is it for a private (non-corporate) jet to be painted other than white (and maybe a black nose)?
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 07:14:47 .
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 07:14:44 I'll go log out of discord now
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 07:14:33 game lag
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 07:10:19 ~~why do I have a feeling someone's gonna read this OOC~~
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 07:10:11 One on top and the piston
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 07:10:07 So only two blocks
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 07:10:05 Make sure the piston touches the conveyor too
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 07:10:00 Oh and the piston
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 07:09:43 <@!624733630882643969> Add a block on top of the conveyor, and give some space for the conveyor itself (only the top block touches the conveyor itself)
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 07:08:46 Though I also have a suggestion for you
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 07:08:40 <#507673335816126509>
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 07:08:34 In the suggestions channel
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 07:07:29 I made two suggestions
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 06:55:01 Nothing big anyways, literally just one typo
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 06:54:46 Oops I made a minor mistake in my suggestion
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 03:29:02 so i asked
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 03:28:56 I haven't designed any trains yet
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 03:27:36 Which one is more correct, the wheels are inside the track (the one on the right) or the wheels are outside the track?
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 03:24:01 Might use a jet engine like in France's Aerotrain xp
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 03:23:25 Specificially, it's tilting system
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 03:23:09 I'm currently making the UK's Advanced Passenger Train
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 15:34:50 i want sleep
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 15:34:47 i like cars
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 15:33:04 BMW has some rally history
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 15:32:47 Porsche has participated in the Dakar Rally
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 15:32:34 - Audi Quattro 
- Ford RS200 
- Lancia Delta S4 
- Bowler Nemesis 
- Volkswagen Racing Touareg 
- Mitsubishi Racing Lancer 
- Not sure about Dakar Rally trucks
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 15:30:57 If the theme for the contest was really cars, I already know some vehicles to buikd
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 15:30:22 That engine is not happy if it's gonna carry too much load though
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 15:29:03 *unhappy Group B and Dakar Rally noises*
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 15:28:26 And one of the choices were rally cars
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 15:28:16 So there's a contest
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 15:26:22 Also, don't use control surfaces, they're crap compared to custom flaps, ailerons, etc.
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 15:25:55 <@237986362601504768> All I do is to experiment around which looks good, also take advantage of Triangle Wedge Block and Triangle Wedges in Wedge 2 for the curves of a plane
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 15:24:49 Get 2 accounts on PvP, one for a large plane and one for the locked motor bomb
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 15:24:03 An aircraft carrier, carrying a powerful a bomb
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 15:23:49 Wait a second
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 15:23:07 But for its absurdity
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 15:22:53 Not for PvP at least
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 15:22:39 Hmm, on a scale of 1-10 

How good is it to skydrop an army from a jumbo jet?
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 15:21:50 And even then, pretty minor
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 15:21:43 I never use trails up until now
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 15:21:34 I forgot those exist
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 15:21:15 <@456226577798135808> What are those rods sticking out of your ladders?
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 15:20:36 So I have to do tankettes, mini fighter jets and other small vehicles
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 15:20:21 Of course I'd have to make scaled down versions of vehicles
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 15:19:50 https://youtu.be/drnxZlS9gyw I'm just gonna post this again 

I still wanna fit an army inside of my plane, it just feels so fitting
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 15:18:52 But again, private, not airliner
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 15:18:40 Three folds, enough for each row to have 7 seats
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 15:17:39 It's also a widebody two floor plane
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 15:17:18 Mine is a private jet, so more attention to the interior is needed too
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 15:16:29 Already reaches well over 2000+ blocks so far, and that's without the interior and engines
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 15:16:05 I still haven't finished that Jumbo Jet
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 15:15:45 I made a Christie suspension tank
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 15:15:12 Mostly for off-roading
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 15:14:57 I still prefer using suspensions though
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 15:14:35 It became buggy storm of a mess
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 15:14:13 I've experienced that a lot when my tank wanted to unexist by breaking suspension
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 15:13:36 I just prefer the look of motor treads
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 15:13:23 Can't argue with you there
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 15:12:31 Does that sound like a decent formula for land vehicle success?
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 15:12:12 Three, speed
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 15:12:00 Two, thicc chonky armor and TNT
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 15:11:39 Lots of firepower
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 15:11:34 One, turrets
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 15:11:29 So, if I make a PvP vehicle
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 15:10:31 The wheels on the tank stretch the belt
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 15:10:13 Oh, I usually go with using the motor belt route
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 15:09:46 I can't change your mind, wheels are faster than treads
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 15:09:29 ***reject atom*** 
***become string (theory)***
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 15:08:45 ***B E C O M E   C E L L***
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 15:08:35 ***R e j e c t   M o n k i***
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 15:08:09 Doge eat froge <@723419054114865202>
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 15:07:27 Ok boomer
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 15:06:40 Isn't it related to titanium?
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 15:05:55 So in real life, too much speed and the planes gets hot? Nothing aero dynamically affected apart from turbulence
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 15:05:00 Basically, high speed aerodynamic stuff
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 15:04:28 I was reading the suggestions log
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 15:04:20 Do planes in real life shake from instability?
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 11:35:14 Is it crap, is it meh or is it decent?
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 11:34:43 <#507673335816126509> I have made my first suggestion
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:39:53 Roblox memes
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:39:40 XD
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:28:36 How do I suggest ideas?
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:27:37 Well, now I have an idea for suggestions
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:24:22 Is that what a swashplate is though?
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:23:40 <@467565971918422017> How did you got live footage of my last two brain cells leaving me?
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:22:40 With a T pose
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:22:34 This pic though, looks like it's showing dominance
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:22:18 Ah yes, I was there
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:21:37 <@551573378662662145> https://youtu.be/drnxZlS9gyw Imagine just casually playing the game with your aircraft carrier and these suddenly land after coming out of a jumbo jet
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:19:08 I have a private jet that uses a conveyor drive as it's main engine, and it saved me a lot of effort
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:18:21 Now it only has the mentioned subtle pitching issues
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:18:08 The same aircraft I just mentioned got buggy with conveyor drives before I redesigned it into what it is today
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:17:40 <@551573378662662145> I mean it could be 

But for me it's so far a hit or miss if it would work or not
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:16:50 (Isn't that basically the strategy of the SR-71?)
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:16:18 To basically outrun shredders
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:16:05 Hmm, if I enter PvP, I might use that aircraft
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:15:13 Even going down slows it down
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:15:04 Assuming I'm travelling in a very level direction without any pitch variations
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:14:34 So I can now reach 1000 with ease
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:14:16 <@287779983445721088> So, I managed to make after burners "stable"

It pitches up, but only *very* subtly
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:13:21 And the momentum carried from being moved by conveyors add up to the launch power of the magnets
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:12:46 So conveyors push the TNT as close to the magnets as possible
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:09:36 They're just a one time thing, a disposable gun
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:09:28 Suspension guns aren't reusable
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:09:19 I use magnets
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:09:05 <@305721738015014913> Make a turret/artillery cannon that fires TNT and cutters
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:08:18 Well, I've made a huge rail gun 

Well, huge design wise anyways, built for appearance anyways
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:07:21 Now I remembered making a railgun 

I'll go take a picture of it and delete it to replace it
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:06:26 Or some other custom heavy duty vehicle
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:06:13 I'll make a custom tank then
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:05:58 It explodes?
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:05:30 Hmm, I wonder if I should try PvP some time
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:04:52 Does TNT armor actually work?
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:02:41 Motor spins an axle that has cutters in it
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:02:01 Now I'm thinking of roller but cutter
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:01:46 Well, I did thought of a lawnmower but it's cutter
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:01:30 Wait, cutters spinning really fast
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 09:59:39 I wonder how forcefields work
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 09:58:34 Shredder bugs are flying snakes but much worse
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 09:57:47 And jumbo jet go haha bomb go boom
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 09:57:28 Tiny planes go ***p o o p*** out of the jumbo jet
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 09:57:04 Sure, as a modification to my existing plane though
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 09:56:44 And added not only aircrafts but also bombs
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 09:56:32 What if I made an aircraft into an aircraft carrier
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 09:56:17 https://youtu.be/drnxZlS9gyw I watched this video and thought
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 09:56:08 I have a stupid idea
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 09:26:23 I haven't seen someone build that yet
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 09:26:14 Underwater aircraft carrier
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 09:25:40 
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 09:23:17 Japan's Shinano
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 09:23:12 But why not the world's largest underwater carrier
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 09:23:04 Sure you have a large supertanker
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 09:22:42 I like making cursed content
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 09:22:20 **O W O**
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 09:22:00 <@!723419054114865202> I misread that as ass
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:52:27 ***p o p***
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:52:22 Add TNT as pimples
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:52:18 Make a face in Plane Crazy
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:50:47 H m m m

Lawn mower with cutters?
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:50:38 TNT
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:48:44 Give me stupid ideas
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:41:27 am tired
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:40:09 And build stupid stuff
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:40:07 I'm gonna go take a break from the plane
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:39:08 To a pretty decent range
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:39:02 I mean I've seen a few times smoke get flung
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:38:42 Problem with smoke is it has a short range
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:38:18 oof, the closest thing I can do is color it and adjust some settings
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:37:57 I'm still brainded xp
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:37:41 I have to wait for the Winter Event
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:37:34 Well crap
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:37:28 oh wait, this uses much more different stuff
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:37:03 How to do it in a straight line?
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:36:58 You know those spinning things that make smoke go well, very far in range
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:36:37 How do people make smoke get flung btw?
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:36:04 It's a remote, that's weeing data
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:35:31 wii remote
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:34:22 I'm just gonna continue making this Boeing/Airbus
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:33:53 Even with the two account setup
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:33:47 Can that thing actually fly like any other vehicle?
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:33:11 How is it even attached though?
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:33:00 woah it's large
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:32:07 I'd like to see that
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:31:58 Like you're literally gonna use 2 accounts
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:31:53 2 account?
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:31:40 *c o l m m*
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:31:34 ah finally
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:30:53 http://www.aviationexplorer.com/boeing_x-32_aircraft/boeing_x-32b.jpg **Hey everyone look at this flying Mazda**
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:30:01 I'm gonna go change the topic
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:29:35 this argument in the chat
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:29:04 I dunno I'm still tired from whatever happened in this chat
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:27:57 If everyone has the power the report over an argument, then wouldn't everyone be reported?
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:26:57 Meanwhile Umbreon just watches from the distance
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:26:03 Why am I even here (apart from VIP servers)
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:24:55 tank do wheelie
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:23:15 There's two Reshirams but they're not related to the one here
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:22:24 I'm in the Vehicle Simulator server
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:21:16 <@!551573378662662145> I'mma show you something funny in game
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:20:51 Both are cool
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:20:39 cool
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:20:31 Is that Godzilla using it's tail to break a mech?
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:18:32 <@!551573378662662145> Let's just go back so we don't have to see this unfold, this is too much for me
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:17:30 At least from what's left of my brain cells
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:17:23 My brain died from how wild the chat is, though almost everyone is agreeable
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:16:47 *Not because people here are bad or anything, it's just too much to comprehend*
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:16:23 *This chat is giving me brain damage*
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:15:50 > PEOPLE LEARN FROM OTHER PEOPLE
Do this, learn from what other people do Resh
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:15:25 Aight

<@!261632279917363200> Just learn how to use custom flaps made out of motor 2. You already know how to use exploits within the game and it's not that hard to use custom flaps
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:14:20 <@!287779983445721088> Okay, I'm gonna calm down for a bit
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:13:26 ***Resh, just accept this is the state of PvP. It's not only about skill but also taking advantage of everything you can use***

***Besides you can make up for that by being good at building***
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:11:10 you know, like this guy
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:11:08 <@!163143541160148992> Still, I gotta give credit to *some* 10 year olds using common sense and making use of everything they know and willing to improve instead of complaining
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:09:42 There is a difference between
"In my opinion, this feature is a bit too overpowered and I would like the devs to nerf this. If you say it isn't, then please explain to me and let's have a constructive conversation instead of a dumb argument"

and

"OMG THIS GAME IS RIGGED, THIS IS CHEATING EXPLOITING AAAA"
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:06:57 Literally just moving pieces of wing
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:06:53 <@!645128367611445248> You are indeed correct, and not only is that being smart, that's actually how ailerons work
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:06:30 Or the Roblox chat
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:06:27 <@!261632279917363200> You haven't seen toxic till you've seen social media
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:05:47 And these bugs and glitches are pretty useful anyways in the first place
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:05:30 Just like real life, you gotta take advantage of everything or you'll end up dying in PvP
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:04:48 <@!707991071476547745> I'm disappointed considering Reshiram is my favorite Pokemon
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:04:16 What the fuck is happening here?
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:03:21 Well, at least the thing works
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 07:49:39 So I'm just gonna go for "cylinder dragging against the ground and hope for the best"
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 07:49:28 Well, I have no idea what kind of custom landing gear to make
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 07:43:12 To maximize damping
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 07:43:07 I'm also gonna combine regular suspension blocks
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 07:42:28 Kinda like the oleo strut suspension used in planes
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 07:42:18 Gonna use pistons for shock absorbers
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 07:40:36 Because I barely have enough room
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 07:40:22 And use a simplified landing gear design
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 07:40:11 I'll cheat and reduce it
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 07:40:05 Boeing 747 has this much rear wheels https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/47/Boeing_747_main_landing_gear.jpg
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 07:38:58 Box go n y o o o o m instead of flot
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 07:38:12 Probably some kids trying to build something without trying to understand it
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 07:37:25 Take note that I already raised this to the height limit, and it has already reached width limit
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 07:36:15 I already used almost all of my plot space
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 07:36:08 It's probably not worth the hassle for me to include that
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 07:35:53 haha plane go nom
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 07:35:41 It looks kinda weird ngl
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 07:35:19 https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/AirBridgeCargo_Airlines_Boeing_747-200F_nose_loading_door_open_and_cargo_loader_at_Sheremetyevo_International_Airport.jpg
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 07:34:36 Would that be worth the trouble or not to add a nose like that?
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 07:34:24 Interesting, the nose of the Boeing 747 is used for storage
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 07:30:05 ~~I wonder if it's enough for 5x5 engines~~
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 07:29:31 I mean wings on planes like these are mounted low and slowly raise high anyways
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 07:28:54 Wings look high enough for engine mounts
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 07:25:48 Such as VTOL
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 07:25:44 Well, at least in certain cases
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 07:25:30 I mean anchoring *is* a cheap trick
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 07:24:23 *disintegrating airliner noises*
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 07:24:12 Or was it another one?
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 07:24:05 Was the company who made that de Havilland? The same company who made the Comet?
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 07:23:01 I tricked someone into looking at my interlaced text
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 07:22:47 Finally my rickroll worked XD
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 07:18:40 Now to test it
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 07:18:34 I finished my rickroll
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 03:23:25 The cyan exploding army
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 03:17:30 It may look like a random mess of blocks, but it's actually just text interlaced in a way that it looks like a random mess of blocks
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 03:16:36 I just gotta finish the text
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 03:16:25 Tell random people there's an optical illusion
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 03:16:22 This is how I'll secretly rickroll people
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 03:10:38 If rick is rolling, would it be considered a rickroll?
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 02:58:40 Fighter? During pre-jet or post-jet?
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 02:53:31 Ah, lava
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 02:50:23 Old computer, old font
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 02:50:13 gonna use this font http://www.fontriver.com/i/fonts/commodore_64_pixelized/commodore_pixelized_v1.2_specimen.jpg
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 02:49:49 So I'm gonna do some interlacing thing
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 02:49:39 But I'm not gonna make it too obvious
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 02:49:27 yes
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 02:49:26 ***b o x y   c a r s***
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 02:49:12 I'm gonna build a rickroll in Plane Crazy
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 02:45:08 Well, look what's happening here now
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 02:45:03 And NANI said it's because weak device
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 02:44:54 Someone earlier said leave the server because it's making them lag
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 02:44:37 You know what's funny
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 02:41:45 making potato noises

plane-crazy 2020-07-24 02:24:40 <#495286269459300364> I dumped
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 02:23:06 I'mma dump something in the dump
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 02:22:31 *We're no strangers to love*

plane-crazy 2020-07-24 02:19:48 ***notice the Lancia Fulvia rick***
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 02:19:15 He both does not and does exist
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 02:19:12 There is a Schrodinger's Rick though

***Rickman!***
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 02:18:03 I have an idea for a cursed build in Plane Crazy

The **owo**mobile
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 02:16:42 Probably pickle
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 02:16:17 Has anyone here made triple fold planes yet?
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 02:15:07 XD
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 02:14:32 ***s c r e m***
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 02:14:29 it would be

Untitled Rick Game
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 02:13:02 aw
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 02:12:46 ~~has someone made a pickle rick joke here before?~~
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 02:12:20 Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 02:12:01 well I am brainded
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 02:11:57 *how did I not notice that*
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 02:11:40 rick's here
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 02:11:36 wait a sec
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 02:11:13 But am I allowed to use stuff related to the Soviet Union? (of course there are limits, such as one certain person I shall not mention about)
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 02:08:40 Random brainfart of a question, is the Soviet Union considered controversial here? Or just another meme?
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 02:05:10 ~~The Germans have some really boxy tanks~~
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 02:04:52 Earlier tanks look easy
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 02:01:11 wat
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 01:41:10 All of them are supersonic commercial planes
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 01:40:54 I have some ideas for my next plane
- Concorde
- Tupolev Tu-144
- Boeing 2707
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 09:24:39 I need a break, I'll go continue the plane later
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 09:24:12 Oh good, that relieves me a bit
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 09:23:46 As well as the windows on a plane, that uses glass and default blocks alternating
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 09:23:30 Does the interior count as "artificially increase block count" or not
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 09:23:20 Okay let me rephrase
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 09:23:10 About certain stuff in a build
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 09:23:03 Oh, I was just asking before I get a ticket
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 09:21:57 <@!271299269984518155> "â€¢ Do not artificially increase the block count of your creation by placing blocks instead of beams."

Let's say a business jet has an interior (with effort placed), which is caught in video, the video used for proof that the plane meets the criteria said in Aeronautical Engineer in <#609442446249820211> 

That isn't counted as artificially increasing block count right? Plus the windows in the plane I have to place, which requires a row of alternating individual blocks of default and glass blocks

Other than those, I've followed what's said, using beams and longer versions of blocks where it can be placed
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 09:06:05 Guess I'll avoid that then
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 09:05:24 I'm surprised I managed to get this far
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 09:03:05 Looks enough for four engines, but for the actual wingspan, I'll either make a triple fold wing or make reach the end of my plot (horizontally)
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 09:02:11 And this thing I'm building, I'm not even sure if it's long enough or not
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 09:01:50 *Look how large the wingspan of an Airbus A380 is*
https://www.seatmaestro.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Airbus-A380.png
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 09:00:54 Because not only do I have to do the exterior, I also have to do the interior
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 09:00:14 If this has enough blocks by the time I'm done for Aeronautical Engineer Rank V, I might as well share a video instead of pictures on <#384025409945337856>
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 08:59:23 This looks like it's enough of a wingspan, isn't it?
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 08:53:11 (I'm gonna fold wings xd)
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 08:53:06 (help my sanity wants unexist)
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 08:46:24 After I build the chonker in <#478584971670454284>
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 08:46:15 Hmm, guess I should
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 08:46:00 I wonder if I should make a waterbase
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 08:43:55 <#478584971670454284> I need help with my chonker
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 08:41:34 Wait I forgot I can do another fold for the wings
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 08:41:11 I can't make the wing go any longer
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 08:40:58 Also, I reached build limit already

plane-crazy 2020-07-23 08:38:19 When you make a magnet cannon shoot a magnet cannon that shoots a plane
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 08:36:31 **"To show you the power of flex tape, I cut this boat in half!"**
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 08:36:17 *idea*
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 08:33:36 Does welding in magnets require another magnet?
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 08:30:17 I remember my buggy, double wishbone
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 08:29:20 25 blocks, nice length (for the wing of my plane)
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 08:26:41 25 then
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 08:26:38 18 blocks and still feels short
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 08:25:18 Guess I'll just experiment then
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 08:25:01 But the length transverse to wingspan, how long?
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 08:24:48 Wingspan I'll just make it reach block limit or something
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 08:24:26 It's too small, how much blocks do you think the wings need to be?
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 08:24:09 Also, the red line is where my wings would be, it's currently at 12 blocks
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 08:23:24 That Hyundai Genesis XD
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 08:23:13 XD
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 08:21:22 It's a flying Mazda xp
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 08:21:02 Except thiccer
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 08:20:58 *Has the same vibe as this* https://pictures.topspeed.com/IMG/jpg/201001/2010-mazda-mx-5-miata-23.jpg
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 08:20:43 http://www.cybermodeler.com/aircraft/f-32/images/df-sd-03-15738.jpg *This*
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 08:19:58 I'm gonna compare the two
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 08:19:33 Just look at their smiles
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 08:19:26 Boeing made a flying Mazda
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 08:19:17 **Oh god Boeing why**
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 08:19:07 And not overrated
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 08:18:37 Single engine, single rudder
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 08:18:26 Well, planes that much your criteria
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 08:18:15 I can think up of a few planes that aren't really common in-game/don't exist
Kawasaki T-4
Kawasaki P-2J
Saab Gripen
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 08:14:53 Mitsubishi... just modified American jet planes from what I've seen so far
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 08:14:39 Or maybe one of Japan's planes
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 08:14:16 In that case go with the Saab Gripen then
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 08:14:09 Unless that plane is also common
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 08:14:05 Saab Gripen or one of Dassault's planes
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 08:13:55 I could think of two things
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 08:13:25 <@456226577798135808> Saab Gripen? Eurofighter Typhoon?
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 08:12:11 I'm a little astonished
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 08:11:50 Someone said they don't know what a plane is
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 08:04:13 Kinda based the wing design of my current plane on the F-35 Lightning
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 08:04:01 I mean there's American fighter jets
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 07:13:17 Fr though canards help with flight at least for me
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 07:12:47 XD
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 07:12:10 canards are pretty useful
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 07:11:35 Oh, what I do is just move it up and move it down
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 07:11:23 Besides if I build my own stuff I can fine tune
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 07:10:55 I prefer using tutorials just to understand the mechanics, and then build my own thing
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 07:09:53 Bug go n y o o o m
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 07:09:48 I'm not gonna go onto PvP because of that
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 07:05:51 Or am I missing something else
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 07:05:47 Magnets?
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 07:05:41 Shoots cutters in a straight line?
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 06:00:04 Aight, brb
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 05:59:37 Wait correct that to none
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 05:59:30 I can barely make any walk off-road
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 05:59:19 I can never understand how people make mechs walk
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 05:50:09 Yes, you're a good boye
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 05:45:34 No motor locking yet, so that should be interesting
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 05:45:24 Once I filled the back with engines
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 05:45:17 So got a speed of 620 as well as instant take off
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 05:28:09 The Boeing 747 is a sky submarine
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 05:27:27 We've gone full circle
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 05:27:12 > i kamikazed a plane
<@!260908127652806656> 
You used the plane against the plane xp
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 05:26:54 <@!385571953903271936> Wait what's the issue you were e-mailing them?
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 05:24:16 i see smol planes on a huge carrier
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 05:23:03 ~~apart from r/cursedcomments and r/blursedimages~~
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 05:22:52 There is nothing weirder than Roblox chat
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 05:17:26 So that means I could possibly get a lot more with more engines
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 05:17:15 I've reached a speed of 500 with less engines
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 05:10:44 Canards get 45, variable incidence delta wings get about 15
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 05:10:01 Gonna adjust more settings to give a more sharper pitch control
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 05:08:28 I've done that, and it was nice
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 05:07:56 I made a plane do a 360 degree roll in about 1.5ish seconds
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 05:07:43 What would be considered too fast of a roll
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 03:47:10 Good for testing all by myself
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 03:46:44 *It's fun to be lonely*
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 03:46:35 Or 3
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 03:46:30 I use VIP2
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 03:46:19 I guess I'm too lazy to open a bookmark
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 03:46:13 Why do I keep using the regular servers xp
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 03:44:02 Well, I'm gonna keep VIP 2 and 3 bookmarked unless I'm told it's not allowed
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 03:41:54 <@!315262125113081856> wait is there any rules about bookmarking them?
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 03:21:25 Anyways I gotta go continue building what I'm building
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 03:20:55 Speak assembly
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 03:20:51 <@!725583147928125461> Use assembly code
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 03:19:59 For some reason HOFUNG's profile picture reminds me of this https://duckduckgo.com/?t=ffab&q=otamatone&atb=v225-1&iax=images&ia=images
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 03:19:09 And Korean is somewhere in between
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 03:18:58 If it's a lot of details, my brain immediately says Chinese
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 03:18:46 If it's more curvy and more simple, my brain says Japanese
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 03:18:08 I have a very watered down understanding of which characters are which
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 03:17:10 Chinese text I don't understand
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 03:14:40 Yep the first one has a better paintjob
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 02:55:46 Even though I haven't played it
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 02:55:40 Bloxburg is weird
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 02:55:26 (I wonder if someone would actually go through the effort of putting games on a calculator)
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 02:54:46 <@!660019099430289418> Here's context to what I said (people run Doom on a lot of unconventional ways)
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nduMTX86Zl0
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 02:52:51 <@!660019099430289418> But can it run Doom?
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 02:52:34 No it's a firewall
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 02:52:10 Or is that Ford Fusion?
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 02:52:06 I see a Ford Focus Domino's delivery car
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 01:57:34 I should probably make the wing fold
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 01:56:52 *This wide then*
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 01:55:56 *Is there such a thing as too wide of a wingspan?*
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 01:55:17 So I can extend the control surfaces further
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 01:55:08 Hmm, I'm gonna make a very long delta wing for the aircraft I'm making
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 01:52:17 This should be the contest

**Best Thanos vehicle**
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 01:51:45 I have another idea
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 01:51:39 no wait
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 01:51:31 Make a Thanos avatar
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 01:51:24 The best Thanos

I have morning braindead dumbassery
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 01:47:12 ***D e e p W a t e r***
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 01:45:46 ~~wait I just forgot what one of the mods said yesterday~~
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 01:45:33 So, that map a leak?
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 01:44:44 The only /help I know is the Minecraft command
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 01:43:55 It's an expanded version of the existing map, both new and familiar
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 01:43:47 I like that
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 01:43:45 I remember that from yesterday
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 01:43:26 I only have 11 days and 3 hours of total in game time spent
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 01:42:58 I'm not even good enough for contests yet xp
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 01:41:49 (I just wanted an excuse to improve on building fighter jets)
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 01:40:47 Either goal works out for me
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 01:40:36 Or at least something that's very agile
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 01:40:11 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermaneuverability
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 01:39:51 I'm gonna start my attempt at a supermanuverable aircraft today
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 14:12:00 On top of my other project
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 14:11:50 That's my next goal
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 14:11:44 I wanna reach supermanuverability
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 14:11:15 Also, I'm gonna add vertical control surfaces then
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 14:11:00 Oh
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 14:10:41 Except I don't know how
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 14:10:31 I remember getting that
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 14:10:20 A bug
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 14:06:48 Easy, but does it have any actual effect on the plane's flight?
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 14:05:43 Well, what if the entire vertical tail wing could move? (unless there's no benefits to that)
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 14:03:59 .
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 14:03:51 So, if I were to make the vertical tail wings moveable, should I move them with vertical or horizontal motor 2s?
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 14:01:44 Does the vertical tail wings at the back have any significant effects?
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 14:00:49 I'll take note of that when redesigning my plane
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 14:00:34 So wingspan and size
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 13:59:31 So wider wingspan won't affect roll?
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 13:58:20 I wonder if wing size and wing shape has an effect on how a plane flies
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 13:41:52 Press X to doubt
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 13:34:53 Which kinda confused the heck out of me
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 13:34:29 Meanwhile on my much longer private jet, it works fine somehow
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 13:34:06 I ended up being a fidget spinner
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 13:33:54 I used one on a large fighter jet
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 13:32:53 More than a comparable rocket engine only plane?
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 13:31:41 And I thought "what if I use them on a plane?"
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 13:31:25 I saw Integex's video
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 13:30:35 How stable are magnet drives?
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 13:27:34 Also any advice when making wings to improve on flight?
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 13:26:22 A quick question, any suggestions apart from more engines to gain improvements in both speed and maneuverability with planes?
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 04:55:00 L i g h t B l o c k s
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 04:53:59 (Honestly that's what your avatar reminds me of xp)
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 04:52:23 Why am I imagining zombie Micheal Jackson
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 04:39:16 > what if they made it so the sealed parts of you build are water tight
<@!658774365261004801> Good luck if your build has doors on it, especially ones that either use pistons or motors
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 04:32:34 big wrinkly brain
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 04:19:27 Yeah the suspension block is a buggy yet useful item
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 04:19:03 Oh it's fine to use the suspension block
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 04:18:34 The suspension block is both useful and buggy
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 04:18:17 That happened to me, several times
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 04:18:10 Not when your build's buggy
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 04:17:25 It's funny considering they can only make blocky pieces of crap
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 04:17:12 So I gave them a taste of their own medicine and showed them my own builds
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 04:17:01 Someone made fun of someone by calling them a noob
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 04:16:12 <@!658774365261004801> The kind who goes "WHY YOU BLACKLIST ME I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING TO YOU"?

In spite of taking up a good amount of plot space, jumps on your builds, tries to get a free ride and constantly bothers you with hi hi hi hi hi
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 03:50:41 <#478584971670454284> (nothing important, just wanted to let out some steam)
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 03:49:39 (I'm very tired of the constant horns)
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 03:49:13 Ew, overused
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 03:45:28 I feel a bit too ambitious about this
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 03:45:02 If the thing I'm building could fly, I might get Aeronautical Engineer IV
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 11:16:11 And the pitch goes up
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 11:16:01 The canards push it up, the custom ailerons push it down
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 11:15:33 Delta wing ailerons*
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 11:15:15 Canard and delta wing go in opposite directions from what I remember
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 11:14:57 Rn, using a combination of canards and delta wing mounted custom ailerons for pitch control
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 11:13:58 Any suggestions on making fighter jets or not?
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 11:12:13 What're squirrel controls?
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 11:12:02 Squirrel controls?
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 11:11:08 (Yes they made a piece of software called Bob)
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 11:10:56 The failed Microsoft product
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 11:10:50 Ah, Bob
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 09:50:46 t h i c k
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 09:12:37 I'm just gonna ask here if it's too long or not <#478584971670454284>
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 09:03:49 The water in the current map is tiny
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 09:03:29 It gives water builds more purpose
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 09:03:19 I'm fine with the water
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 09:03:00 It's both familiar, yet it's also new
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 09:02:55 Hmm, I prefer this expanded version
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/384021699466756107/735058588372041828/expanded_mappp.PNG
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 09:02:37 Plus a more wintery area
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 09:02:23 More water, more land, and some islands
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 09:02:15 I see it's an expanded version of the current map
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 09:01:44 I see the road, and I think of racing
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 09:01:13 I still want something like that
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 09:00:59 I want this map
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 09:00:34 Well hopefully this makes sense on a plane the size of an Airbus A380/Boeing 747
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 09:00:19 The result of a 2 fold being used on a plane
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 08:55:44 I underestimated the size of a fold
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 06:35:26 â€‹

plane-crazy 2020-07-21 05:28:04 Think of it as smaller separate tasks rather than one big task
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 05:27:56 Micromanagement
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 05:27:52 I probably know another thing that could motivate me in building the plane
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 05:27:02 (Except for the pilot seat)
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 05:26:54 That sounds nice
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 05:26:06 Should I join you or...
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 05:25:31 What do you need assistance with?
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 05:25:01 wat?
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 05:23:56 Kinda find it funny someone's trying to get through the blacklist wall via tons of rockets
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 05:23:31 ~~speaking of afterburner, that's also the name of a game Sega made~~
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 05:23:00 Because I wouldn't be given robux anyways
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 05:22:52 I think I'll just wait for the next Winter Event
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 05:22:05 Afterburners are nice, especially in PvP
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 05:14:48 Under Airbus Corporate Jets
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 05:14:36 So Airbus also makes private jets
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 05:09:07 I see that GT-R has some camber on it
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 05:08:37 xp, no not really
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 05:06:12 The Boeing 747 is a perfect example of a widebody
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 05:05:56 Well, there's two kind of airliners, narrow body and widebody
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 05:05:36 Yes
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 05:05:20 Got triggered, said "HI IDIOT" and left
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 05:05:10 And eventually what I said above is exactly what happened
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 05:04:58 Not even a simple "hi"
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 05:04:29 I've already posted that plane (widebody, 2 floors) I'm building, and y'all can assume that I really don't want any interactions
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 05:02:56 Some rando: *sees I'm obviously very busy*
Also rando: *jumps around, tries to get an unwelcome ride and other distractions*
Me: *blacklists*
Rando: ***t r i g g e r e d***

How common is this?
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 04:55:45 Or basically make up South Korea itself
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 04:55:26 Just look at Samsung, they make tanks
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 04:55:22 I mean I'm not surprised if an Asian company happens to make a lot more things than what they're commonly known for
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 04:54:11 Under Piaggio Aerospace
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 04:54:00 Also makes planes
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 04:53:57 So Piaggio, the scooter manufacturer
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 14:38:27 *sad level 10 noises*
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 14:38:04 ***y o u r***
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 14:37:22 "Gonna make you cry"
"Gonna say goodbye"
"Gonna tell a lie and hurt you"
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 14:34:26 "Gonna run around and desert you"
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 14:34:17 "Gonna let you down"
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 14:34:14 "Gonna give you up"
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 14:32:12 "We're no strangers to love"
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 14:29:45 This engine needs improvements but this looks like it's good enough for 747 like private jet
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 14:27:45 But I think reports are still closed
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 14:27:19 Now that sounds like abuse
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 14:24:37 Blacklist abuse?
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 14:21:35 I mean in a literal sense all a private jet has to be is to be private owned (in a sense that it isn't used by the public in the case of airliners)
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 14:20:59 So it's still considered a private jet
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 14:20:15 To be specific, the Boeing 747-8 VIP
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 14:19:24 <@!260797229068058634> *cough* Boeing Business Jets *cough*
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 14:16:26 Which means I have to make it a widebody with two floors
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 14:16:10 Not a very scaled down version
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 14:16:03 <@!260797229068058634> Yeah but the size I'm aiming for to reach Boeing 747 size
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 14:11:57 So bless me that I finish this
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 14:11:50 Btw, the engines I'm planning to make them 5x5
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 14:06:52 Those red and yellow blocks are to give a sense of scale of the nose
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 14:06:35 2 floors (with a small 3rd floor for the pilot and staff)
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 14:06:25 With 3 (or maybe an extra 4th vertical) folds?
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 14:06:11 Make a private jet of this size
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 14:05:54 So, y'all think it's possible?
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 14:04:00 Gonna take a picture of the nose to provide a sense of scale
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 14:03:08 The size I'm aiming for would be like your typical Boeing Business Jet
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 14:02:53 How hard is it to make a 3 or 4 fold double floor (partially triple, mostly for the pilot and room for staff) as a private jet?
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 12:38:47 Same here, I have no idea how mechs and robots work
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 11:10:41 The only thing missing is an alligator and a real live Florida man
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 11:10:21 Oh I was referring to this https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/384021699466756107/734726186760142918
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 11:09:55 Well I gtg
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 11:09:49 Also, that's pretty neat
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 11:09:38 I'm laughing so hard at the "Meanwhile in Florida" pic
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 11:08:42 <@!274565008837574656> Energia? The Soviet equivalent of Apollo?
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 10:36:56 You're welcome
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 10:36:54 <@!483221629195911189> Transformers gone wrong
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 10:36:16 Duck but OOC
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 10:13:54 I wanna see that XD
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 09:45:10 Anyways, I'm gonna recreate a pushrod suspension in the game cuz why not
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 09:44:27 Add a speaker and some designs and it'll be a flying boombox
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 09:44:17 I misread that as boombox
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 09:44:00 Hmm

***S h r e d d e r   l a w n m o w e r***
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 09:43:37 Or maybe an ATV or a giant lawnmower
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 09:43:26 I'mma go make a pull/pushrod suspension, because why the heck not?
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 09:42:01 XD
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 09:41:14 Do crankbells make for good heavy duty suspension?
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 09:39:11 Give me ideas on what to build
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 09:36:20 Apollo 69621420 when?
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 09:35:38 It's Asian
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 09:35:35 Except it's not German
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 09:35:30 The successor to the Gumpert Apollo Sport https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_Intensa_Emozione
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 09:34:24 more save data
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 09:34:07 Plane Crazy 2, softcoded and with more f e a t u r e s
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 09:33:48 There's two successors to the Gumpert Apollo Sport
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 09:33:26 (a real car, look it up)
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 09:33:17 Gumpert Apollo Sport
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 09:32:43 More advanced aerodynamics? (Let me guess hardcoding xp)
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 09:32:18 That 1/4 half wedge but faces outsi- aww
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 09:31:46 But bigger plot would help out
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 09:31:39 Bigger map and bigger plot are both good
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 09:31:27 Well, we can only hope one day we get those features
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 09:30:21 So

More wedges (not strictly longer)
Save data
Plot size
Map size
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 09:28:34 Save data and plot size
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 09:28:01 So that suspension I showed could be independent if to each individual wheel
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 09:27:43 Independent suspension generally should mean that the wheels acts independently of each other
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 09:27:11 Save data and plots are what we want
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 09:26:38 More save data
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 09:26:35 Now that's what I want
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 09:26:18 Bigger plots over longer wedges
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 09:25:59 But larger builds would require more save space
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 09:25:50 Bigger plots would make larger builds possible
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 09:25:08 <@!467765396108476426> Look the made the wingplane in real life XD https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northrop_Grumman_B-2_Spirit
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 09:24:32 Because wings are already flat, and plane is almost made of wings
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 09:24:15 Wingplane, now that's definitely a pancake xp
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 09:23:34 ||please don't get mad at me xp||
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 09:23:18 Stealth bombers are just flying explosive pancakes
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 09:22:33 Just wait till they know about the Discord server
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 09:22:11 That's the kind of people who need VIP servers
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 09:21:27 
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 09:21:26 Some rendering bugs (crosshair is still there, hence that glass nub)
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 09:20:31 And is only made from text
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 09:20:26 Crosshair is thicc
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 09:19:55 This looks like the worst way to fly
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 09:17:24 Taking advantage of how Plane Crazy renders glass behind glass (it only renders the one closest to you), I made the exterior of my plane's cockpit dark while the inside has a clear view (at least when facing from the front)
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 09:08:34 Why am I having too much fun doing aileron rolls
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 09:05:25 I got both Aeronautical Engineer II and VTOL I
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 09:04:08 I got both
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 09:04:02 I did it
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 08:48:05 <@!645128367611445248>
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 08:47:56 So aeronautical engineer II
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 08:47:39 My fighter jet has about 439 blocks
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 08:47:22 Let me see how much blocks I have on my plane
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 08:46:12 And maybe VTOL I
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 08:45:46 Gonna try applying for aeronautical engineer rank
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 07:01:59 Than to not have technical stuff but have a lot of building to do
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 07:01:48 I'd rather work out the technical stuff in a small space
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 07:01:42 I'm too lazy for a carrier
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 07:01:32 **T h a t ' s   h u g e**
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 07:01:04 <@!447221768520859659> Thanks
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 07:00:16 I don't have nitro
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 07:00:12 Well, any suggestions on how to share video?
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 06:59:49 Or are those two separate?
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 06:59:46 Do I get aeronautical engineer if I do VTOL?
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 06:46:20 And yet here I am with a minty blue-green color
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 06:45:56 I'm just a basic terrain specialist
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 06:45:45 Oh I thought you only needed any rank
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 06:45:00 many
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 06:16:37 and e x p a n d
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 06:16:32 Involving Donkey Kong
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 06:16:27 Oh god why did you have to remind me of an old meme
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 06:11:06 How often do people give their original aircraft design names here?
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 06:10:01 Ah, that's when my tank experience belt failure
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 06:02:58 ***T u r k e y D i n n e r***
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 06:02:36 ***d u c k***
***q u a c k***
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 06:01:25 :do::it::again:
:not: :like: :this:
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 06:00:52 s p a  c e
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 05:59:47 I feel like something's missing
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 05:58:54 What the hell happened to that plane
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 05:55:57 1.) When applying for VTOL, does that also accomplish aeronautical engineer?
2.) Is limited roll counted or does it have to be capable of rolling 360 degrees?
3.) How am I gonna fit a video with the limitations on Discord?
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 05:44:53 Kinda like his personality
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 05:44:46 Only colors but no texture
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 05:42:03 "You're practically breaking the game"
Every conveyor/magnet drive user
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 05:40:43 <@!645128367611445248> He got mad, and you're just enjoying flying your box
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 05:40:11 Reminds me of this meme
**"NOOOO YOU CAN'T DO THAT"**
"haha box go nyoooom"
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 05:33:16 Replaced every control panel with wing panels, considering every wing in my plane can now be controlled
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 02:55:37 But if it can achieve a speed of 500 (without afterburners) while having yaw, pitch and 360 degrees of roll then I'm happy enough
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 02:54:43 Oof again they didn't align on my plane
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 02:54:10 What's the blue called again I forgot xp
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 02:54:05 Huge engines definitely have an effect with center of mass
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 02:53:39 <@456226577798135808> What's CoM?
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 02:52:38 I had to make flaps using motor 2 to assist with lift but it works
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 02:52:23 It finally works!
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 13:50:49 plane go ***n y o o o o m***
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 13:37:29 Let's not discuss about piracy here, so let's stop
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 13:36:45 And considering I was already playing, I've already invested too much time into it
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 13:36:16 It was later on that I found it was cracked
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 13:35:58 I wish I could buy but they dont
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 13:35:37 ~~My parents don't buy me Minecraft so I have to use cracked~~
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 13:35:07 Or maybe I've just missed having friends
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 13:34:58 It's still good, Microsoft hasn't failed but it just doesn't feel like it used to
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 13:34:03 <@456226577798135808> Kinda lost the magic ever since Notch was gone
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 13:17:12 Kinda like Minecraft, I used to play that game a lot but now I just don't have the motivation anymore
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 13:16:32 And when I am addicted, I don't leave until I'm tired of it
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 13:16:18 Honestly this is the only game on Roblox I found to be addicting
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 13:15:14 I mostly lurk in Plane Crazy (help I'm addicted), YouTube, ~~depressed birds~~ Twitter and sometimes Discord
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 13:14:32 I just do random stuff on the internet
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 13:14:03 again
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 13:13:57 oh wait I wooooshed myself
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 13:13:44 There's even videos people have made
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 13:13:31 <@551573378662662145> A type of webcomic anyone can create 

It involves countries, represented as balls. Do whatever joke you want, whether it's for fun or if it's for educational stuff
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 13:10:24 (Assuming I'm good at it XD, so probably need to learn it first)
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 13:09:55 Looks like I have a decent amount of choices to try pixel art on
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 13:09:38 Let's see...
- Portal 
- Half-Life 
- Team Fortress 
- Sonic The Hedgehog 
- Shenmue 
- Space Harrier 
- Fantasy Zone 
- Alex Kidd 
- Crazy Taxi
- After Burner 
- Out Run
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 13:03:56 VTOL also looks possible, that is if I could find a video platform
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 13:01:20 Sega has more than Sonic for me to choose from
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 13:01:04 Also, seeing there's pixel art, I might think of doing one of Sega's IPs or one of Valve's
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 13:00:19 <@456226577798135808> I see you're into Polandball/Countryballs
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 12:57:25 Which I used to add custom rims
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 12:57:15 Just a 5x5 fabric wheel composed of the different half wedges that's confusingly similar in name
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 12:56:04 That's what I did to make custom wheels
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 12:55:44 Use half wedges and stuff
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 12:55:34 Experiment to see which works
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 12:55:20 By yourself
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 12:55:11 I mean you could smoothen it out
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 12:54:30 VIP is nice 

being alone is nice
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 12:53:44 A thing but with inertia
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 12:53:34 Well, I procrastinated today and made a flywheel
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 12:52:26 I can only make custom 5x5 circles for my wheels
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 12:51:01 I'm still figuring out lift (which you've already told me can be done by using locked motors) but hey at least I can spin my plane 360 degrees (the barrel roll I mentioned)
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 12:50:09 The plane though is smaller for now, as I'm still learning
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 12:49:34 Oh, my brothers playing right now
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 12:49:06 The fact that I made a barrel roll has convinced me I still have a lot more to learn
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 12:47:57 I followed the video
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 11:28:45 Downforce is good on the track, but not for pure speed
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 11:24:31 Now that I think about it
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 11:24:27 Sorry if I didn't make up my mind, but I think a smaller aircraft's better for practice
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 11:23:47 I'll go use a tailed delta, maybe combined with a compound delta design
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 11:20:44 Otherwise it doesn't work
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 11:20:32 I used wings as spoilers on a truck, but it's just an anti-roll over system
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 11:20:02 I mean there is basic downforce, but it's not really the kind I'd say makes a car less slippery and more grippy, and more like less likely to roll over
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 11:19:16 Ground effect is useful for cars, just look at Lotus's success in Formula 1 before the FIA banned it
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 11:18:48 Like ground effect, how the shape of a vehicle effects stuff, etc.
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 11:18:36 By aerodynamics, you mean more advanced stuff?
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 11:16:55 
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 11:16:53 So, any hope for fixing this non-PvP plane?
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 11:12:20 I'm gonna use the F-22 Raptor wing setup
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 11:09:07 ***Oh***
My dense af brain thinking it's a good idea to use conveyor drive as a main engine now knows why it's bad
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 11:04:41 <@!287779983445721088> Is it a good idea to use conyevor drives not as the main source of thrust but as after burners?
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 11:03:14 Honestly unless I do go PvP I'm not gonna consider block size for now
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 11:02:32 The tutorial just says it's for lag and for making a smaller target
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 11:01:57 Well, it just says it's ideal to keep it under those amount
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 11:01:26 Though I will consider that when replacing my first good aircraft
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 11:01:05 So, keep it under 370 parts

Well, this one's more for creative purposes
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 10:59:55 I'm currently on one of the VIP servers, I like I'm all alone
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 10:59:40 Thanks jay
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 10:57:53 Out of desperation I'm gonna watch some tutorials on some jet fighters
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 08:35:02 Ah neat, well I gtg
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 08:31:54 oh neat i got a rank
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 08:31:44 I've made a Christie suspension
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 08:19:29 Just send 'em a rickroll
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 08:11:39 Let me guess, trolling people? xp
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 08:10:52 And if that's true, maybe I shouldn't be that harsh
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 08:10:41 Guessing must be a kid
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 08:09:14 Doesn't seem to talk too
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 08:07:49 Which ended up not really working for him as it couldn't move
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 08:07:36 I used bellcrank based front suspension, and what he did was just attach the wheels to motors which were attached to another motor probably for steering
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 08:06:48 I shouldn't worry too much though, looks like he didn't take the time to understand *how* it worked
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 08:06:11 <@!387195148741771275> While I was afk, doing stuff in here in Discord and while my truck was still spawned, I noticed he made a low quality copy (which was the picture I showed)
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 07:42:39 This is the kind of stuff that makes me wanna blacklist everyone who randomly comes into my plot
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 07:41:51 b o i someone copied me
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 07:40:36 <@!287779983445721088> So, locked motors are good

What else am I supposed to know before I build a large fighter jet?
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 07:37:55 Maybe I'm just doing something wrong so that's why it wasn't as fast for my first time
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 07:37:43 I'm gonna try locked motors again
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 07:37:06 I'm gonna take note of motor locks
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 07:36:39 Support's offline though
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 07:34:11 Now to wait
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 07:27:40 Thanks
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 07:26:40 <@!468207489524039680> Sorry for the ping

Does `TERRAIN SPECIALIST [I]` require video proof or is a picture/multiple pictures good enough?

All blocks are attached to the build, no locked motors used for appearance too, though it does have functioning doors (via motors) that can lock and the bed can rotate independently (still attached via an unpowered motor) considering it's a semi-truck
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 07:18:09 Yeah screw it I'm gonna go with that route instead
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 07:17:50 That should probably only require a picture
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 07:17:37 <@!645128367611445248> What was the minimum again? I have a semi truck that has around 447 blocks
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 07:16:14 Wait a fucking minute there's VTOL rank, and my vehicle has 200+ blocks
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 07:14:56 I'm gonna do that so I can get easy in
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 07:14:36 <@!645128367611445248> Can it be based on something real?
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 07:13:39 The only reason I'd want ranks would probably be servers
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 07:13:06 from laziness
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 07:13:04 filled with fat
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 07:12:58 really smooth smol mashed potato
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 07:12:47 I am mashed potato
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 07:02:31 That was when I reduced the amount of control panels
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 07:02:03 It just feels floaty and sensitive
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 07:01:50 A center mounted one though only leaves me with sensitivity issues
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 07:01:10 plane go fidget spinner again when engine's at the back
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 06:56:40 I've never seen outlines on builds
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 06:48:35 As well as to find a way to make my plane not become a glorified fidget spinner
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 06:48:05 So I decided to not place wings until I get help in what to do when solving that issue
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 06:47:34 <#478584971670454284>I'm still frustrated by the fact it's very sensitive in going up
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 12:31:27 I don't even know what a swashplate is
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 12:30:34 Only blacklist
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 12:30:31 You can't
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 12:30:16 Tbh, I was joking about how Germany in World War couldn't manage to hold onto France
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 12:29:37 Wait it is
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 12:29:14 I thought Germany can't get French stuff
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 12:28:59 Wait did I hear French and German in one sentence?
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 12:26:42 Well, my plane has a little bit of asymmetry at the front
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 12:26:30 O h
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 12:26:17 Does even a little asymmetry affect flight?
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 12:25:45 I even added canards late into development
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 12:25:25 Both the delta and tail wings can move
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 12:25:14 Theres flapperons
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 12:25:03 Two tail wings
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 12:24:57 It has a huge delta wing
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 12:24:37 On a somewhat large plane, enough to fit in custom landing gears
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 12:24:20 Well, how does one achieve stable flight
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 12:23:45 <@287779983445721088>, what does it mean if my plane keeps favoring going one direction until it spins or has an unstable flight
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 12:22:42 I was making a fighter jet for context
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 12:22:16 So it keeps kinda leaning right and from there just spin and be unstable
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 12:22:03 It sorta favors one direction more
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 12:21:26 Well, flight become unstable and it spun
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 09:11:39 And maybe head over to the land of drama and depression known as Twitter
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 09:11:24 Well, I'm gonna go search for *sustenance* 

aka food :>
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 09:10:31 Nah, I'm from the Philippines
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 09:09:53 I am Asian, who builds European stuff
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 09:09:42 The Citroen part you'll get when you see the front grille, the Mercedes-Benz part from the water propeller I used for the logo xp
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 09:09:02 I also have a cab over design that looks like some sort of Citroen/Mercedes-Benz hybrid
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 09:08:42 Which is based on conventional cab ones like the International Workstar
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 09:08:24 Like that's even bigger than my semi truck
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 09:08:04 ***B I G***
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 09:07:40 Sure why not xp
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 09:07:33 Devs are memes
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 09:06:58 I swear rick is a meme within PC
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 09:06:25 Well, only one way to find out 

***I ' m   g o n n a   c u t   t h i s   p l a n e   i n   h a l f***
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 09:05:36 Would a cutter going up then falling down be considered a gullitone?
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 09:05:07 ***B o i***

He needs to get off the sauce
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 09:04:42 XD
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 09:04:40 **To show you the power of flex tape, I cut this plane in half**
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 09:03:22 Unless it's glass
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 09:03:17 Hmm, pistons make for good sliding doors
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 09:02:37 And the tail end basically
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 09:02:29 It uses folding for the kitchen and staff room
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 09:02:16 I have a private jet
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 09:01:38 I'm happy enough though my first good plane (the side air intake Bell X-1) actually flew pretty agile, and with a conveyor drive that's pretty stable
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 08:59:59 I accidentally overwritten my first jet a while ago 

I was proud that it had perfect VTOL
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 08:59:14 Like imagine the Bell X series, with just curvy side air intakes added
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 08:58:33 My first fighter jet literally was just a rocket with wings and curved side ducts
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 08:57:28 I've seen some
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 08:57:06 Oh, the modified tutorial planes I said?
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 08:56:13 And then put back the control panels for the sake of agile movement
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 08:55:53 If I'm gonna take a picture of the plane I'm building, I think I'll go replace the control panels with wing panels
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 08:54:36 I mean I've seen worse, which are just modified tutorial planes
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 08:54:24 ~~I wonder if it has the S-duct at the bottom of the Eurofighter Typhoon~~
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 08:54:01 It doesn't look bad, honestly looks good
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 08:52:33 If not then I might do that to avoid said domino xp
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 08:52:01 Not like making separate accounts, but the equivalent of liking your own tweet on Twitter
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 08:51:35 Are there any rules for Plane Crazy's equivalent for self-promotion 

S e l f - u p v o t i n g
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 08:48:58 Well, I shouldn't give a crap about downvotes then
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 08:47:29 Also is it just me or are there people intentionally "mass" downvoting other peoples' builds?
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 08:46:32 Neat
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 08:46:22 We're both potatoes
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 08:45:44 <@387195148741771275> Well I'm a big dumb dumb potato
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 08:44:59 My brain still feels like mush
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 08:44:22 Ah crap
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 08:43:32 Also, I don't know how to feel that all it took was this game to give me some interest in planes xp
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 08:43:04 Ah, okay then 

I just usually call the tail wings on planes like the de Haviland Vampire boom tails
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 08:40:56 Am I seeing a boom tail at the back?
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 08:40:11 plane: haha car/boat go boom
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 08:38:58 I'm more appealed by the building aspect anyways
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 08:38:35 That's why I don't go in PvP
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 08:37:53 I've done before tbh, couldn't remember if it gave a dip in performance or not
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 08:36:21 Aight then, y'all probably know better than me anyways
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 08:35:27 It's unnatural, but at least I get the one thing I want 

***s p e e d***
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 08:34:32 All I did was add a 0.9 block behind the conveyor, after that I didn't have any problems so far
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 08:34:04 I see your point but it working fine for me to be honest
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 08:32:05 I just added a 0.9 block so the piston doesn't extend on its own
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 08:31:53 It worked for the last fighter jet I made
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 08:31:34 yes
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 08:31:28 I mean, it's a price I'm willing to pay for, unless I end up making over sensitive steering
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 08:29:38 Continuing my plans with my plane

Decided to go with a delta wing setup similar to the F-22 Raptor 

I thought of making almost every wing movable, made them almost out of control panels. Planning to add separate motor controlled flapperons, movable tail wings that adjust both to A and D key presses and keys assigned for ascension/descesion, air brakes that also can be used for steering, and vertical tail wings for added control 

The main source of thrust would be from a conveyor drive, and considering it's gonna be a bit large added custom landing gear and a moving canopy

So, are those plans good?
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 08:24:22 It's like he's trying to make it scary but ended up making a child's plaything
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 08:23:21 <@292578772333363200> Dang that car looks like something a 5 year old would do, and even then they'd make it less cringy
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 08:21:28 Maybe I'll use motor 2 too next time
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 08:21:13 Aight that's fair
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 08:21:05 Well, if it works then it works
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 08:20:40 Oh, I use motor 1
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 08:19:45 Imagine a Minecraft model, but it has the "missing texture" texture
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 08:18:53 Wayne built eyesore
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 08:18:16 I don't even know how to build helicopters
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 08:17:35 Meanwhile I'm building the said plane
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 08:17:17 All he did was make a basic fuelselage
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 08:16:57 That reminded me of this one guy who said "amateurs" in the chat
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 08:13:36 And add more stuff too
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 08:12:20 Finally had the motivation to try building a larger fighter jet
plane-crazy 2020-07-08 04:52:15 I'm too lazy to make that
plane-crazy 2020-07-08 04:51:45 E g g
plane-crazy 2020-07-08 04:45:07 Guess I could start with something like a Dodge Challenger, looks easier to build than a Ferrari 599X
plane-crazy 2020-07-08 04:44:20 Gonna find other high performance cars
plane-crazy 2020-07-08 04:43:27 Hmm, hover thruster headlights...
plane-crazy 2020-07-08 04:43:06 A Mustang truck?
plane-crazy 2020-07-08 04:31:28 I mean it doesn't look that small
plane-crazy 2020-07-08 04:25:03 <@!163143541160148992> Wait, more space as in space on the vehicle itself or empty space within the plot?
plane-crazy 2020-07-08 04:19:30 As you can see in the picture above
plane-crazy 2020-07-08 04:18:55 Well, the car I'm building ain't that large anyways
plane-crazy 2020-07-08 04:13:59 That's what I'm expecting y'all would say would be the best thing for me to do
plane-crazy 2020-07-08 04:13:31 I think the best answer for a newbie with locked motors details is to just experiment to see what works
plane-crazy 2020-07-08 04:10:58 ~~I really hope I'm not overcomplicating again~~
plane-crazy 2020-07-08 04:07:10 That single motor over there is where the locked motors will start from
plane-crazy 2020-07-08 04:05:30 The entire front, maybe other sides of the car
plane-crazy 2020-07-08 04:05:03 The idea is to make a front engined supercar, I was thinking of using locked motors to add more details to the front of the car
plane-crazy 2020-07-08 04:03:36 <@!409676438682206218> The actual thing, yeah, but the details, well it's my first time doing this so...
plane-crazy 2020-07-08 03:37:13 Could search other front engined supercars
plane-crazy 2020-07-08 03:35:56 I'm a bit lost though on how I'll make some decent looking headlights
plane-crazy 2020-07-08 03:34:22 That enough space for say something like a Dodge Viper?
plane-crazy 2020-07-08 03:34:02 Well, the width of the car I'm building is 7 blocks
plane-crazy 2020-07-08 03:32:10 How hard is it to use locked motors for details on a moving vehicle?
plane-crazy 2020-07-07 08:00:10 <@!163143541160148992> Oh, yeah details are good, I just meant it with what's under the hood
plane-crazy 2020-07-07 07:50:09 Sorry if that confused you
plane-crazy 2020-07-07 07:49:56 <@!479784834475229186> Epic that 600+ was for speed of jet planes not torque
plane-crazy 2020-07-07 07:46:13 I scrolled up and see 600+ is apparently a decent speed
plane-crazy 2020-07-07 07:41:18 Where I made it unnecessarily complex
plane-crazy 2020-07-07 07:40:45 I've made the plane simple, and it's still pretty good compared to my previous builds
plane-crazy 2020-07-07 07:37:24 So, more like add as much functionality needed, but don't overcomplicate?
plane-crazy 2020-07-07 07:23:11 Does this quote "Simplify, then add lightness" will work well when building stuff in Plane Crazy?
plane-crazy 2020-07-07 06:50:27 Finally figured out what to do when designing a plane
plane-crazy 2020-07-07 03:39:43 Still finding the video that suits my needs
plane-crazy 2020-07-07 03:32:15 The heck the car I built has a lot of downvotes
plane-crazy 2020-07-07 03:31:08 I kinda regret making variable sweep wings, they weren't that useful
plane-crazy 2020-07-07 03:30:54 I'm planning to use conveyor drives
plane-crazy 2020-07-07 03:03:35 It's like the difference between following instructions and teaching you the basics and other stuff to consider when designing a plane
plane-crazy 2020-07-07 03:03:03 There's a lot of tutorials on how to build a specific plane, but not a tutorial where it teaches you *how* to build planes
plane-crazy 2020-07-07 03:01:49 gonna just wait for plane building advice
plane-crazy 2020-07-02 22:34:48 oof Discord being buggy again
plane-crazy 2020-07-02 22:34:30 Private parts and fireworks? Now I see why it's bad
plane-crazy 2020-07-02 22:28:25 Does a detailed enough recreation of a real car enough to get a rank? I'm building a Mercedes-Benz 300SL
plane-crazy 2020-07-02 04:02:14 I just realized the suspension setup I used is basically the Jaguar Independent Rear Suspension
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 10:10:06 <@451853936815636511> Well, I guess I should complete that ICBM carrier, based on something Russia/Soviet Union built 

I also have a dragon but it's not completely original
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 10:08:38 Rank*
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 10:08:34 Anyways gonna figure out how to get a ranj
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 10:06:58 Like I'm just here to build stuff
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 10:06:46 I just wanted to point that out
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 10:06:15 <@318291033626771457> Tank, roleplaying isn't the first reason people play this game 

The building aspect is, and PvP
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 10:03:49 A rank in here?
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 10:03:33 <@723419054114865202> Aight I'm gonna actually listen, how do I get in that free VIP server you just said?
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 10:02:46 **STOP USING CAPS**
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 10:02:02 Seriously I find it annoying when people 
- Park their vehicles in my plot 
- Jumping around where its being built 
- Riding in my vehicle like they're my friend
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 10:00:29 By ramming you
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 10:00:21 And it'd annoying if a rando decides to use up most of your space
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 09:59:52 Seriously though, PvP's not for everyone
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 09:59:31 **BRUH NOT EVERYONE PLAYS PVP**
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 09:58:44 <@723419054114865202> Dude, not everyone has robux
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 09:57:52 **bruh we hate random people invading our spaces**
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 09:55:44 Meh, I don't bother
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 09:55:10 Was just building a Corvette C1
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 09:55:02 Good thing I wasn't working on something that was very important
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 09:53:48 That's how I do it
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 09:53:44 Reset your character
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 09:53:25 Cheap solution for speed
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 09:53:14 Just need magnet/conveyor drive engines
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 09:53:00 And somehow it worked
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 09:52:48 And made it have forward swept wings
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 09:52:36 Placed most of the weight in the middle
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 09:51:59 So...

After the mounting the huge rocket engine in the middle my plane flew better
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 08:45:42 Decided to rebuild the whole plane to distribute the weight of the engines in the middle
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 08:35:15 Sweeping it back made it into a glider
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 08:35:08 Also on my F-14 Tomcat design I found having the wings swept forward gave it better control
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 08:34:13 Is it because me placing a lot of the engines at the back it's causing problems?
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 08:33:48 It also had VTOL and didn't rely on having many control surfaces
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 08:33:34 My first plane had a huge rocket engine mounted in the middle
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 08:31:01 I find it a little funny I keep devolving in functionality
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 08:30:36 I don't get how the F-14 Tomcat I made can fly but this one I tried doing myself doesn't
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 08:29:35 I did what you said literally
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 08:28:49 Nothing's welded but yet it doesn't give a speed boost
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 08:26:17 And I honestly couldn't be bothered to learn how to make a compact conyevor drive yet
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 08:25:57 Because it's easy to build
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 08:21:23 Blacklists are pretty useful, my personal space isn't being invaded
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 08:19:40 Oof, I tried putting the magnet drive back in and the magnet drive seemed to have made the ride bouncy
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 08:17:40 nvm i forgot about helium
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 08:16:15 bouncy flight
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 08:05:48 Also just to give visualization on those front wings, they're only about 14 blocks long (not combined)
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 08:05:21 Hmm, okay then
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 08:01:43 Using the wings at the back for sharper steering but if needed I'll turn them into flaps
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 08:01:17 I colored the wings in blue
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 08:01:03 
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 07:58:51 I have variable sweep wings, but not flaps
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 07:58:09 So do I give it bigger wings?
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 07:57:34 Do wings affect it's ability to get off the ground?
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 07:57:26 I already placed a magnet drive engine
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 07:56:56 Any advice when I wanna make a plane fly?
plane-crazy 2020-06-19 09:39:13 I'm just confused now xp
plane-crazy 2020-06-19 09:35:23 Are those 5G towers? XD
plane-crazy 2020-06-19 09:35:03 I feel stupid for forgetting the last bit of <#623337136267067393>
plane-crazy 2020-06-18 09:58:42 Because I'm still lost af
plane-crazy 2020-06-18 09:58:13 Well, can someone explain how are wishbone suspensions built?
plane-crazy 2020-06-18 09:57:13 5 block gap between the cylinder wheels
plane-crazy 2020-06-18 09:56:54 I was trying to make a suspension setup for smaller cars
plane-crazy 2020-06-18 09:56:15 Didn't do double wishbone as it was too big for 3x3 cylinder wheels
plane-crazy 2020-06-18 09:55:50 <@283153622496182274> I made a wishbone for a suspension setup I'm making
plane-crazy 2020-06-18 08:26:57 Okay, simplified it to this

What's next?
plane-crazy 2020-06-18 08:25:43 **aaaahh**
plane-crazy 2020-06-18 08:09:53 Once it becomes a single wishbone, it moves again
plane-crazy 2020-06-18 08:08:56 I'm confused how as soon as I connect the steering and the wishbones, the wishbones don't wanna move anymore
plane-crazy 2020-06-18 08:07:37 Oof I forgot to check if the wishbones can move, and it can't
plane-crazy 2020-06-18 08:04:07 Still an early WIP
plane-crazy 2020-06-18 08:03:51 Red - Steering
Blue - The unusual wishbones I said
Green  - Chassis
plane-crazy 2020-06-18 08:03:29 Like in the sense that it won't move around like it's on a hinge, but in an actual suspenison
plane-crazy 2020-06-18 08:03:13 Before I continue, anyone know any methods to make sure these don't move around too freely
plane-crazy 2020-06-18 08:02:57 
plane-crazy 2020-06-18 08:02:56 
plane-crazy 2020-06-18 08:02:56 
plane-crazy 2020-06-18 07:55:27 That's a weird threat
plane-crazy 2020-06-18 07:54:48 I feel like I'm gonna frustrate myself a lot in trying to make sure it doesn't move freely like a hinge and actually move like a suspension
plane-crazy 2020-06-18 07:53:21 I did the wishbones (albeit with a strange shape due to the space constraints I placed on myself) but after that it's gonna be a lot of reverse engineering stuff

Edit: >_< dang I forgot I was gonna use 3x3 wheels
plane-crazy 2020-06-18 07:49:31 xp
plane-crazy 2020-06-18 07:24:44 And the wheels are fabric cylinders
plane-crazy 2020-06-18 07:24:19 I feel like I'm gonna have a hard time considering I'm trying to fit it within 5 block width space between the wheels
plane-crazy 2020-06-18 07:22:25 Well, I should go ahead and try making a compact one
plane-crazy 2020-06-18 07:19:12 Well, at least I started with the double wishbone part
plane-crazy 2020-06-18 07:16:03 Currently observing parts of Prototrode's suspension design in an attempt to try understanding some more complicated designs
plane-crazy 2020-06-18 07:13:52 Or what to do when designing the suspension of a car
plane-crazy 2020-06-18 07:12:51 Does anyone know any suspension designs?
