help 2018-12-09 20:36:03 I really need some help making helicopters. What are some pointers?
help 2018-12-09 20:36:21 Ping me if you have any ideas please
help 2018-12-09 20:37:29 <@163143541160148992> Do the super rockets go against the propellers?
help 2018-12-09 20:37:58 Wait really
help 2018-12-09 20:39:05 And do the two propellers counteract eachother?
help 2018-12-09 20:39:39 I see
help 2018-12-09 20:39:45 also, how could I get a creation into <#384025409945337856>

help 2018-12-09 20:48:22 very interesting
help 2018-12-09 20:50:13 Would this be effecient on modern planes with wings that don't flat out on the far side, like the F-22 and F-35?

help 2018-12-09 20:52:17 another question
help 2018-12-09 20:52:30 does using beams rather than blocks reduce lag due to less block count
help 2018-12-09 20:55:13 <@163143541160148992> Do super rocket engines have the same mass as regular blocks? if not, more or less?
help 2018-12-09 20:55:21 more or less mass*
help 2018-12-09 20:56:28 I'm trying to balance out the centers of gravity and flight in a large jet
help 2018-12-09 20:56:47 I had ice blocks in because I thought they were heavier but I'm going to replace them with rockets
help 2018-12-09 20:58:29 I literally
help 2018-12-09 20:58:38 never thought of weighing blocks that way
help 2018-12-09 20:58:43 you have enlightened me
help 2018-12-09 21:01:23 four super rockets weigh less than a block
help 2018-12-09 21:01:25 feelsbadman
help 2018-12-09 21:05:52 I reduced by block count from 600 to 550

creations-chat 2021-07-11 14:32:19 <@!509810265915916318> Just a question, why did you build your plane all vertical with pistons and stuff like that? I'm an old player and I've never seen that before.
creations-chat 2021-07-11 14:35:28 <@!611251614178869269> I played whenever the bomber role literally just came out, then proceeded to get banned from the discord from 2 years for being toxic. Can you elaborate on what a motorlock is?
bot-central 2021-07-11 14:36:30 As I said in the <#504436696021204992> channel
bot-central 2021-07-11 14:36:34 Got banned for two years 😐
bot-central 2021-07-11 14:36:43 This server probably used ro-ver
creations-chat 2021-07-11 14:40:53 No need to be toxic, I want to learn not argue
creations-chat 2021-07-11 14:43:58 You don't think that's a little toxic?
creations-chat 2021-07-11 14:47:38 <@!783822669182795806> Yeah really not a good first impression of the server, but I guess that's just the root of this game. Roblox was already bad as it is, being in a snobby plane-nerd community that rivals the nature of games like War thunder and HOI4 just makes it worse.
creations-chat 2021-07-11 14:51:25 Anyway, ignoring the argument for now, can anyone help me troubleshoot a plane I built a few months ago? will fly but is constantly veering off to the opposite side any time it tries to turn.

creations-chat 2021-07-11 15:13:17 You guys are really stuck up, the only way that the supposed "white name" creators are going to learn is by positive and critical feedback, not snobby comments.
creations-chat 2021-07-11 15:17:36 stuff like this? haven't seen him say anything, yet he's being dog-piled for posting probably his first build, rather than just giving him some upvotes and some criticism. You're not being insulted, you're just being overly snobby and rather toxic
creations-chat 2021-07-11 15:19:57 <@!711009848438947850> this you?
creations-chat 2021-07-11 15:22:28 actually, this is his most recent build on 6/26
creations-chat 2021-07-11 15:25:56 I'm not trying to be a jerk, considering that's what I was just speaking on, but you can't go, I quote: 
"Man there are some talented people here in creations

Then there are the acceptable people who at least know their shit

Then there's the white name noob posts that make you want to vomit"
and then have stuff like that sitting up in creations.
creations-chat 2021-07-11 15:29:52 Why are you critiquing other people's builds for being bad if your builds have haunting like:dislike ratios? All I'm saying is that you could stand to be a little bit more uplifting, rather than constantly downvoting builds that don't look like perfect, block by block to scale models of the jets that they resemble. It's really toxic, and hypocritical.
creations-chat 2021-07-11 15:34:30 <@!711009848438947850> well to answer your question, here is a screenshot from a build 3 years ago I made to get the bombardier rank. Also to answer <@!588596347272167456>, this is a build from 3 years ago proving that I am an older player.

help 2021-07-11 16:08:55 Does the torque of the aerilon make it pivot harder?
help 2021-07-11 16:12:22 not talking about the setting torque lol
help 2021-07-11 16:12:57 
help 2021-07-11 16:13:31 If the motor is in the middle of the wing vs. the extreme of the wing, will it pivot harder due to increased torque?
help 2021-07-11 16:16:36 Because of algebra based physics
help 2021-07-11 16:17:32 If both motors are applying the same force, but the wing to the right has a bigger radius than the one to the left, then according to the formula for torque, the wing to the right should have 3 times the torque or the wing to the left
help 2021-07-11 16:17:45 or 2x sorry
help 2021-07-11 16:20:41 Which way are you folding them in? <@!711717986943238175>
help 2021-07-11 16:20:44 I might be able to help
help 2021-07-11 16:21:34 On my raptor model that I'm working out what I did was a piston attached to a car wheel attached to a motor
help 2021-07-11 16:21:43 But it folds into the body of the plane
help 2021-07-11 16:22:13 Oh, it's like mine!
help 2021-07-11 16:23:12 I used a motor 2 servo with a 90* max angle on it being toggled

help 2021-07-11 16:23:31 It may take some trial and error
help 2021-07-11 16:23:35 is the light blue part the servo?
help 2021-07-11 16:24:07 Just use one of the keys as G, because it's a toggle
help 2021-07-11 16:24:16 the other can be un-binded to something you won't press
help 2021-07-11 16:24:30 and set the torque to unlimited so that it works
help 2021-07-11 16:24:39 or max
help 2021-07-11 16:24:59 yw : )
creations-chat 2021-07-11 16:33:10 That's very reasonable
creations-chat 2021-07-11 16:37:58 With competition comes progress, but of that, while most people are proud of their builds here to say the least, the problem comes in when the pride of the critics blast their ego so high that they can't stand to give any feedback or criticism to low tier builders and just end up insulting them, and it's kinda gross to see.
