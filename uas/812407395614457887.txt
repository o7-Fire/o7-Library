creations-chat 2021-09-13 08:03:41 where did u get the diagram from?, i get mine by searching up diagram.
creations-chat 2021-09-14 06:08:45 <@456226577798135808> the body is too thin.
creations-chat 2021-09-14 06:11:10 it should be 2 blocks wide (half block - block - half block) to be accurately realistic.
creations-chat 2021-09-14 06:13:14 its my opinion , i like the build but i'd rather prefer wider, if your seeking realistic scale
creations-chat 2021-09-14 06:15:18 looks awesome. what image did you use for your reference and scale. <@!527127714004467723> i think it looks perfect(in my opinion)
creations-chat 2021-09-14 06:17:23 i used yt vids of people checking up or walking around a aircraft. and i can get the scale. and lengh accurately. i also use sketchfab sometimes. i mostly do airliners and i get around 2 yt vids and 2 diagramic images.
