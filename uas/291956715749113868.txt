creations-chat 2020-06-11 17:32:58 It's a plane made out of paper.
creations-chat 2020-06-11 17:33:07 What is hof?
creations-chat 2020-06-11 17:33:24 Huh.
creations-chat 2020-06-11 17:37:13 E h.
creations-chat 2020-06-11 17:37:28 Wish there was no size limit.
creations-chat 2020-06-11 17:37:42 And also build mode similar to WFYB.
creations-chat 2020-06-11 17:43:30 I can't understand how people build those massive builds in HoF.
creations-chat 2020-06-11 17:43:52 3k blocks make my battleship glitchy and loads my I5.
creations-chat 2020-06-11 17:43:58 Up to 90%
creations-chat 2020-06-11 17:44:16 So I'm trying to not use more than 2200 blocks.
creations-chat 2020-06-11 17:44:27 Huh.
creations-chat 2020-06-11 17:46:12 Someone, told me the truth.
creations-chat 2020-06-11 17:46:21 How they can fit 5k blocks.
creations-chat 2020-06-11 17:46:31 I have like...
creations-chat 2020-06-11 17:46:37 5 days in counter.
creations-chat 2020-06-11 17:46:44 Or six. Don't remember.
creations-chat 2020-06-11 17:47:03 Ah.
creations-chat 2020-06-11 17:47:12 Sorry.
creations-chat 2020-06-11 17:47:26 Anyways.
creations-chat 2020-06-11 17:47:34 I can't understand how it works.
creations-chat 2020-06-11 17:47:48 All above I wrote.
creations-chat 2020-06-11 17:48:05 How people build megamassive builds with that limited space.
creations-chat 2020-06-11 17:48:29 And how they make their CPU not start melting wolfram.
creations-chat 2020-06-11 17:49:31 Meme.
creations-chat 2020-06-11 17:49:58 <:kek:652566605028524033>
creations-chat 2020-06-11 17:50:07 Indeed.
creations-chat 2020-06-11 17:50:15 I can make it fly, probally.
creations-chat 2020-06-11 17:50:47 Maybe?
creations-chat 2020-06-11 17:51:21 <:kek:652566605028524033>
creations-chat 2020-06-11 17:51:40 I built my Cobra Mk-3 in about 3 hours.
creations-chat 2020-06-11 17:52:04 And AT-AT took only like 45 minutes excluding painting.
creations-chat 2020-06-11 17:53:08 I could possibly build whole Citadel from Mass effect with detailed interrior in 1/3 scale from original.
creations-chat 2020-06-11 17:53:24 But if game didn't had borders...
creations-chat 2020-06-11 17:53:39 Building borders.
creations-chat 2020-06-11 17:54:07 Those borders are reason why I can't build Normandy and full sized Tempest.
creations-chat 2020-06-11 17:55:17 I had Ronin and Ion from TF|2 before. But their controls was to wacky as stability.
creations-chat 2020-06-11 17:55:50 ^
creations-chat 2020-06-11 17:58:10 Can I post build from WFYB here?
creations-chat 2020-06-11 17:58:19 Big sad.
creations-chat 2020-06-11 17:58:31 Not in creations, but in creations chat...
creations-chat 2020-06-11 17:58:35 Just to show.
creations-chat 2020-06-11 17:59:36 Build Anaconda.
creations-chat 2020-06-11 17:59:43 Or maybe Sidewinder.
creations-chat 2020-06-11 18:00:07 Funniest part.
creations-chat 2020-06-11 18:00:15 I never played tutorial in PC.
creations-chat 2020-06-11 18:00:53 I just clicked "No" and started trying random stuff I find in build mode.
creations-chat 2020-06-11 18:01:43 Try to build coilgun.
creations-chat 2020-06-11 18:01:53 C o i l g u n.
creations-chat 2020-06-11 18:01:58 Magnetic accelerator.
creations-chat 2020-06-11 18:02:22 Hm.
creations-chat 2020-06-11 18:02:47 Try then to build UNSC Paris-class frigate.
creations-chat 2020-06-11 18:03:19 
creations-chat 2020-06-11 18:03:21 Here it is.
creations-chat 2020-06-11 18:03:51 There is not much movable parts.
creations-chat 2020-06-11 18:04:06 Just balance with helium, add engines.
creations-chat 2020-06-11 18:06:53 ~~Meanwhile my cruiser in WFYB.~~
creations-chat 2020-06-12 04:39:53 <:bruhaps:646045387911725106>
creations-chat 2020-06-12 04:40:02 It just works.
creations-chat 2020-06-13 05:45:35 Some spoilers. I managed to get some free space by deleting my old Chornos Station from ME.
creations-chat 2020-06-13 06:42:47 Some more update for building.
creations-chat 2020-06-13 06:43:00 I love those people who build trash and blacklist everyone to protect it.
creations-chat 2020-06-13 06:43:42 Oh god, how I want damn outline for blocks.
creations-chat 2020-06-13 06:44:42 Because it will be no need to paint into fabrics each time.
creations-chat 2020-06-13 06:50:44 Ok.
creations-chat 2020-06-13 07:00:06 Illegal what?
creations-chat 2020-06-13 07:08:58 Lol.
creations-chat 2020-06-13 07:09:14 Any other material is less usefull as outline.
help 2020-06-13 10:47:01 Any idea how to simulate hyperjump?
help 2020-06-13 10:47:25 Seen how someone freeze on one place with anchor then zap with ultimate speed forward.
creations-chat 2020-06-13 10:53:58 Any idea how to make simulated hyperjump?
creations-chat 2020-06-13 11:26:27 UNSC Nebula is finished.
creations-chat 2020-06-13 11:26:38 
help 2020-06-13 11:58:57 And how it works?
help 2020-06-13 12:39:43 Never used tutorials but well...
help 2020-06-13 12:56:17 It's not enough fast.
help 2020-06-13 12:57:15 I need half-blocks?
help 2020-06-13 12:57:20 Or friction blocks?
help 2020-06-13 13:02:48 Alright.
help 2020-06-13 13:02:53 It still to slow in any way.
creations-chat 2020-06-13 13:03:42 Yes.
creations-chat 2020-06-13 13:03:47 I know this pain.
creations-chat 2020-06-13 13:44:36 I managed to make a working MAC on my Nebula.
creations-chat 2020-06-14 09:32:20 Any idea what I need to build?
creations-chat 2020-06-14 09:35:50 Wich rank lol?
creations-chat 2020-06-14 09:35:53 <:kek:652566605028524033>
creations-chat 2020-06-14 09:36:12 I'm not going for any ranks.
creations-chat 2020-06-14 09:36:24 I'm building only for entertaiment.
creations-chat 2020-06-14 09:49:33 Exept for camera shields.
creations-chat 2020-06-14 09:57:47 What if my crafts don't have wings?
creations-chat 2020-06-14 10:05:39 As I understand - more blocks = slower craft.
creations-chat 2020-06-14 10:05:53 So basicaly no way to make my frigate go over 500 wich is a limit.
creations-chat 2020-06-14 10:06:14 And I don't want to make earrape by filling it's internals with super rocket engines.
creations-chat 2020-06-14 10:06:50 ~~Also there should be missles with normal tracking to intercept suicidal kids.~~
creations-chat 2020-06-14 10:07:55 Hover drive?
creations-chat 2020-06-14 10:08:30 They are placed horizontally with blocks under them?
creations-chat 2020-06-14 10:08:41 I am right?
creations-chat 2020-06-14 10:13:29 And they I suppose are CPU intensive, right?
creations-chat 2020-06-14 10:14:45 My frigate is making my CPU stagger, so no way.
creations-chat 2020-06-14 10:15:23 Is speed of the build possibly connected to FPS?
creations-chat 2020-06-14 10:15:38 Because more FPS I get, slower my builds become.
creations-chat 2020-06-14 10:20:38 Second one.
creations-chat 2020-06-14 10:23:59 Hm. PvP definetely requiring a system wich will punish small builds and increase usefulness of large one.
creations-chat 2020-06-14 10:24:31 Like the more connected blocks does build have, the more HP will have each block.
creations-chat 2020-06-14 10:24:59 Connected will prevent building huge piles of blocks and small plane away from them to make it tanky.
creations-chat 2020-06-14 10:25:37 Still will suffer because of static HP amount.
creations-chat 2020-06-14 10:26:06 Another thing is more connected blocks build have, the more powerfull it's engines and weaponry.
creations-chat 2020-06-14 10:26:37 So basicaly super engine spam on small snakes will be not as effective as on huge spaceship or plane.
creations-chat 2020-06-14 10:27:09 Lmao. TnT shield.
creations-chat 2020-06-14 10:27:27 Will be ugly but kids will use it.
creations-chat 2020-06-14 10:28:12 TnT need to explode from any shot I think.
creations-chat 2020-06-14 10:29:22 That will stop kamikaze boys.
creations-chat 2020-06-14 10:31:39 Lol.
creations-chat 2020-06-14 10:47:22 Co-op blocks when?
creations-chat 2020-06-14 10:47:32 Other people on pilot seats can use turrets?
creations-chat 2020-06-14 11:08:46 Why rockets are so slow sometimes?
creations-chat 2020-06-14 11:08:54 Slower than my M-44 Hammerhead.
bot-central 2020-06-15 09:49:35 ?shelp
bot-central 2020-06-15 09:56:17 I am stoopid.

bot-central 2020-06-15 09:57:51 How the hell I should suggest stuff?
creations-chat 2020-06-15 10:00:50 I had idea to build Quasar carrier.
creations-chat 2020-06-15 10:01:13 But then I made E-7 Kadara.
creations-chat 2020-06-15 10:01:14 Huh.
creations-chat 2020-06-15 10:04:50 I could probally make it with folded mechanics and actuall hangar spaces and interior, but that's something like 7/10.
creations-chat 2020-06-15 10:05:38 I can suggest you to round the corners here.
creations-chat 2020-06-15 10:13:04 I gave you image.
creations-chat 2020-06-15 10:14:39 Hangars, if you don't understand.
creations-chat 2020-06-15 10:14:49 E h.
creations-chat 2020-06-15 10:14:59 Let me guess - engines are inside?
creations-chat 2020-06-15 10:15:58 Well, not bad for a phone user?
creations-chat 2020-06-15 10:16:32 I never played roblox on phone but as I remember my suffering with sketches in Sketchbook - that's pretty uneasy.
creations-chat 2020-06-15 10:21:17 <:kek:652566605028524033>
creations-chat 2020-06-15 10:21:23 I don't know what to build.
creations-chat 2020-06-15 10:21:30 Help me to suffer a bit less.
creations-chat 2020-06-15 10:29:55 I n d e e d.

creations-chat 2020-06-15 10:51:52 Yes.
creations-chat 2020-06-15 10:51:59 This will be probally coilgun.
creations-chat 2020-06-15 19:01:52 Wich tags I can get like "Master shipwright"?
creations-chat 2020-06-15 19:02:19 Because, well, my stuff is not the worst I'm sure of it.
creations-chat 2020-06-15 19:03:11 ~~Like I have working VTOLs, hovertanks, spaceships and all are in good style.~~
creations-chat 2020-06-15 19:03:31 <@!308156968550268928> 👀
creations-chat 2020-06-15 19:04:09 I feel I'm going to be slapped with a hammer to the head.
creations-chat 2020-06-16 12:11:37 Eh, why helium is prohibited on *all* ranks?
creations-chat 2020-06-16 12:11:46 <:thconking:535171057649188865>
creations-chat 2020-06-16 12:13:24 Some builds then request using of insane amount of wings/engines to fly.
creations-chat 2020-06-17 12:59:01 Physics being calculated on player's PC, that's why.
creations-chat 2020-06-17 13:03:30 It's me or music from music boxes doesen't work?
creations-chat 2020-06-17 14:28:25 Forgive me god.
creations-chat 2020-06-17 14:28:33 I made a machine to rickroll everyone.
creations-chat 2020-06-17 14:28:39 Most of the building places.
creations-chat 2020-06-17 14:31:10 This simple system made out of anchors, suspension, some conveyers and speakers can make a good music for everyone's ears.
creations-chat 2020-06-17 14:31:16 Especially rickroll.
creations-chat 2020-06-17 15:06:47 Yes.
creations-chat 2020-06-18 06:28:22 I like that Rectifier. Was a fan of modern Tron film and some games.
I could probally try to build this thing too.
creations-chat 2020-06-18 06:31:36 Nvm, forgot that I'm bjonking at 258.5 memory with my head. Big sad.
creations-chat 2020-06-18 06:35:08 Can someone tell me how people put images on buildings? Isn't those are just text with inserted emoji?
creations-chat 2020-06-18 06:52:38 3 hours on 241 detail. 🤔
creations-chat 2020-06-18 10:15:54 Damn, I think people gonna hate me because of Rickrolling.
creations-chat 2020-06-19 15:34:46 Why people send their easy builds with an idea to get upvoted? <:what:644996672048463942>
creations-chat 2020-06-19 16:02:21 I hope I won't be banned for rickrolling whole servers?
creations-chat 2020-06-19 16:03:12 You know the rules and so do I.
creations-chat 2020-06-19 16:03:57 Lmao, being insulted in a video game. What a whimp human need to be?
creations-chat 2020-06-19 16:06:49 <:kek:652566605028524033>

creations-chat 2020-06-19 16:08:29 Because I'm already tired.
creations-chat 2020-06-19 16:08:51 Did it 3 times on CoP tank.
creations-chat 2020-06-19 16:09:22 Lmao, I'm not that edge to actually saying that I want to kill myself.
creations-chat 2020-06-19 16:10:00 H o w a b o u t m e b u i l d a n o t h e r f r i g a t e?
creations-chat 2020-06-19 16:10:12 ~~22 years old dude not approves.~~

creations-chat 2020-06-19 16:10:25 <:kek:652566605028524033>
creations-chat 2020-06-19 16:12:26 Do I need to stick with Paris/Stalwart class structure or use Strident? This one was made by combining first two.
creations-chat 2020-06-19 16:13:21 Yes.
creations-chat 2020-06-19 16:13:30 But I love In Amber Clad's chadity.
creations-chat 2020-06-19 16:14:43 Anyways, update for Nebula light frigate - I managed to fit in it's nose one MAC.
creations-chat 2020-06-19 16:15:20 And it fires 6 explosive balls wich are pathetic at high speed. <:kek:652566605028524033>
creations-chat 2020-06-19 16:15:39 Mostly they bounce off the target and randomly explode in midair.
creations-chat 2020-06-19 16:16:39 Why coilguns are bad in PC?
creations-chat 2020-06-19 16:17:49 Magnets.
creations-chat 2020-06-19 16:18:17 Basicaly just magnets without enabled weld and magnets only.
creations-chat 2020-06-19 16:18:19 .
creations-chat 2020-06-19 16:18:26 Lemmie make simple coilgun.
creations-chat 2020-06-19 16:19:38 
creations-chat 2020-06-19 16:19:40 Indeed it is.
creations-chat 2020-06-19 16:20:00 Ball yeeting coilguns are pathetic.
creations-chat 2020-06-19 16:20:15 Really. There is no balls that works like cutters.<:kek:652566605028524033>
creations-chat 2020-06-19 16:20:36 I want them to pierce targets.
creations-chat 2020-06-19 16:21:06 They have tendency to deal 0 damage.
creations-chat 2020-06-19 16:21:37 Specially checked it with one dude who built just giant black wall.
creations-chat 2020-06-19 16:21:49 And fired MAC from frigate.
creations-chat 2020-06-19 16:22:10 ~~All my builds suffer in PvP. Small planes nerf when.~~
creations-chat 2020-06-19 16:22:45 Why people use motor lock in all builds? <:kek:652566605028524033>
creations-chat 2020-06-19 16:22:57 I can't get it.
creations-chat 2020-06-19 16:23:08 Me?
creations-chat 2020-06-19 16:23:12 Lmao.

creations-chat 2020-06-19 16:23:40 Imagine using motor lock.
creations-chat 2020-06-19 16:23:57 This text was made by purity builder gang.
creations-chat 2020-06-19 16:24:33 Can ya show simple things wich motor lock can do?
creations-chat 2020-06-19 16:24:39 I don't understand how it works.
creations-chat 2020-06-19 22:23:01 Lmao.
creations-chat 2020-06-19 22:23:11 Guide kids?
creations-chat 2020-06-20 07:58:21 Nope.
creations-chat 2020-06-20 07:58:31 But you can cheap with usage of helium and ballast.
creations-chat 2020-06-20 07:59:05 There is vanilla roblox water physics.
creations-chat 2020-06-20 07:59:36 So basicaly it doesent matter how wide your ship.
creations-chat 2020-06-20 07:59:48 All that matters - amount of blocks wich collide with water.
creations-chat 2020-06-20 08:00:06 <:kek:652566605028524033>
creations-chat 2020-06-20 08:00:18 This is why I hate dem Plane Crazy.
creations-chat 2020-06-20 08:00:36 It's physics calculations way worse than KSP or something like this.
creations-chat 2020-06-20 08:00:48 And I know that it hardcoded, etc.
creations-chat 2020-06-20 09:17:52 Move along.
creations-chat 2020-06-20 09:17:56 Or pick up that can.
creations-chat 2020-06-20 10:10:20

creations-chat 2020-06-20 10:22:55 C h o n k.
creations-chat 2020-06-20 10:22:58 Huh.
creations-chat 2020-06-22 07:22:03 It is even possible to build bipod walkers without use of gravity slider, helium, engines on foots, cameras as support and goddamn 30 buttons assigned just on walking?
creations-chat 2020-06-22 07:22:52 <:kek:652566605028524033>
creations-chat 2020-06-22 07:23:14 Because I want to make combat-usable Ronin without all this stuff.
creations-chat 2020-06-23 17:18:11 Can someone suggest to add explosive ball replicator blocks? <:kek:652566605028524033>
creations-chat 2020-06-23 17:18:30 I'm to stupid to find out how to suggest and a bit busy right now.
creations-chat 2020-06-23 17:18:36 No u.
creations-chat 2020-06-23 17:18:44 No u^2.
creations-chat 2020-06-24 05:26:07 Why there is only like planes, cars, carriers and rockets? <:kek:652566605028524033>
creations-chat 2020-06-24 05:26:36 They repeat so oftenly that sometimes I think that those are tutorial creations.
creations-chat 2020-06-24 05:32:04 Atleast I feel myself individual with all my sci-fi trash.
creations-chat 2020-06-24 05:32:38 <:KEKW:670310537300672528>
creations-chat 2020-06-24 05:32:53 Where is my rank for making spesships?
creations-chat 2020-06-24 05:33:05 Ah, there is none.
creations-chat 2020-06-24 05:33:20 And actually there is no reason for them. <:KEKW:670310537300672528>
creations-chat 2020-06-24 05:34:00 Anyways, I still can't figure out how to suggest stuff. Tried what bot typed me but it won't send in <#507673335816126509>
creations-chat 2020-06-24 05:34:02 Lmao.
creations-chat 2020-06-24 05:34:05 Ur gay.
creations-chat 2020-06-24 05:34:53 Ah.
creations-chat 2020-06-24 05:35:06 Then forget about suggestions from me. <:KEKW:670310537300672528>
creations-chat 2020-06-24 05:35:57 Anyways I wish there will be special block that replicates explosive balls like rockets and releases them when used.
creations-chat 2020-06-24 05:36:43 It will make coilgun builds not one-time-use and I will finally have an ability to MAC the whole spawn from the sky.
creations-chat 2020-06-24 05:39:19 Actually there also can be balance for stacked guns. The more guns you have closer to them, the weakier damage they will deal.
creations-chat 2020-06-24 05:40:07 Because building stacked guns and wooshing on a white small plane a giant ship wich can't hit you is a such shame.
creations-chat 2020-06-29 13:57:29 Wish that damn guns didn't had bullet trajectory.
creations-chat 2020-06-29 13:57:52 So it won't be so painfull to try and hit small flying target.
creations-chat 2020-06-29 14:03:08 Gravity zero not much helps with it.
creations-chat 2020-06-29 14:18:37 Still there is no way to fight small planes on big things.
creations-chat 2020-06-29 15:22:42 How you could fit your minigun on a small 1 gun-sized sentry?
creations-chat 2020-07-02 08:55:54 I like how much damn tutorial kids are there.
creations-chat 2020-07-02 09:15:53 You can't surprise me with PvP servers wich are cancer.
creations-chat 2020-07-02 10:32:48 Cursed.
creations-chat 2020-07-03 18:05:10 <@!419477639229865984>, imagine game being hardcoded on that level that only physics of your blocks being calculated on your PC. Yes, Plane Crazy doesen't calculate all the physic on server side. Server side only synchronizes players between them and it deals with it badly - bombs can explode without any damage, cutters don't priece when shot from MAC, other weird physic stuff.
creations-chat 2020-07-03 18:30:59 
creations-chat 2020-07-03 18:31:36 <@!419477639229865984>, Magnetic Acceleration Cannon. Coilgun.
creations-chat 2020-07-03 18:31:53 Then why I can walk on blacklisted area?
creations-chat 2020-07-03 18:32:29 Yep. Basicaly engine is the reason why my MAC on a frigate is useless.
creations-chat 2020-07-03 18:32:42 6 balls don't do damage at all because of high speed.
creations-chat 2020-07-03 18:33:09 Doesen't work.
creations-chat 2020-07-03 18:33:41 Yes. Or bonk in contact with blocks and lost all inertia.
creations-chat 2020-07-03 18:33:47 With little to no damage.
creations-chat 2020-07-03 18:34:49 No way up to the momen when there will be proper synchronisation between players.
creations-chat 2020-07-03 18:35:07 You can launch ton of missles on a fast plane and he will have no damage.
creations-chat 2020-07-03 18:44:37 Current state of Plane Crazy.
creations-chat 2020-07-03 18:45:10 PvP included.
creations-chat 2020-07-03 18:47:43 There is no rules. Exept ToS of Roblox.
creations-chat 2020-07-03 18:47:56 A good way to deal with cutter snakes meanwhile.
creations-chat 2020-07-03 18:48:22 Inside it's full of blades and... Rotating blades.
creations-chat 2020-07-03 18:48:43 And yes, it's playing gachimuchi songs.
creations-chat 2020-07-03 18:49:05 Because ♂️ as we can ♂️
creations-chat 2020-07-03 18:52:56 Lmao, imagine those people who don't build planes. Like me.
creations-chat 2020-07-03 18:53:13 My stuff is like at least to big or to realistic to shot them down.
creations-chat 2020-07-03 18:53:17 Exept this cat.
creations-chat 2020-07-03 18:53:28 I'm not into WT.
creations-chat 2020-07-04 15:51:46 Help me.
creations-chat 2020-07-04 15:51:48 Help.
creations-chat 2020-07-04 18:57:29 Do I don't understand something? What's wrong with forth july?
creations-chat 2020-07-04 18:57:33 <:kek:652566605028524033>
creations-chat 2020-07-04 18:57:52 Not as long as my Puma limo-edition.
creations-chat 2020-07-04 18:58:22 
creations-chat 2020-07-04 18:58:29 Yes.
creations-chat 2020-07-04 18:58:33 I sold my soul.
creations-chat 2020-07-04 18:58:44 Any suggestions to make more cursed warthogs?
creations-chat 2020-07-04 18:58:55 Don't make them?
creations-chat 2020-07-04 18:58:58 :wheeze:
creations-chat 2020-07-04 18:59:13 No thanks.
creations-chat 2020-07-04 18:59:33 Imao.
creations-chat 2020-07-04 18:59:44 Yes.
creations-chat 2020-07-04 18:59:58 I don't like when someone dominates me.
creations-chat 2020-07-04 19:00:06 Even when girl does it.
creations-chat 2020-07-04 19:00:49 Anyways.
creations-chat 2020-07-04 19:00:56 Maybe wide warthog?
creations-chat 2020-07-04 19:01:14 I will paint it in blue.
creations-chat 2020-07-04 19:01:17 And write on it.
creations-chat 2020-07-04 19:01:30 You know what.
creations-chat 2020-07-04 19:02:30 Wich kind of cannon?
creations-chat 2020-07-04 19:02:58 Hm.
creations-chat 2020-07-04 19:03:01 You got me.
creations-chat 2020-07-04 19:03:41 Another check.
creations-chat 2020-07-04 19:03:45 Railway warthog.
creations-chat 2020-07-04 19:03:54 <:lmfao:527971550360633393>
creations-chat 2020-07-04 19:05:29 
creations-chat 2020-07-04 19:05:45 What can go wrong?
creations-chat 2020-07-04 19:06:11 Another check.
creations-chat 2020-07-04 19:10:38 
creations-chat 2020-07-04 19:12:06 Who didn't got reference for underwater warthog, there is a video with time stamp on it. https://youtu.be/exo4xI31DOU?t=135
creations-chat 2020-07-04 19:15:35 Bruh.
creations-chat 2020-07-04 19:17:46 Hardcore mode.
creations-chat 2020-07-04 19:17:56 You spotted a feature from future update.
creations-chat 2020-07-04 19:18:12 Live with your mistakes.
creations-chat 2020-07-04 19:19:54 Meanwhile.
creations-chat 2020-07-04 19:20:06 Pink frigate.
creations-chat 2020-07-04 19:43:34 Damn, PvP is that easy to balance. Wish I could suggest it.
creations-chat 2020-07-04 19:43:39 But I have no rank.
creations-chat 2020-07-04 19:43:49 <:lmfao:527971550360633393>
creations-chat 2020-07-04 19:46:09 Actually it's simple - more blocks you have, more HP each block has, more damage guns/rockets deal. More guns/rockets are placed together - less damage each deals to compensate their amount. To compensate that there could be heavier counterparts for them.
creations-chat 2020-07-04 19:46:41 Derp, suggest it. Don't forget my name on it.
bot-central 2020-07-04 19:54:30 S o m e o n e p i n g e d m e.
creations-chat 2020-07-04 19:56:17 Check.
creations-chat 2020-07-04 19:56:32 I will make Totally normal Warthog.
creations-chat 2020-07-04 19:56:39 But later when I will buy more drinks.
creations-chat 2020-07-04 19:56:54 And take a nap.
creations-chat 2020-07-04 19:56:59 After 2 days of no sleep.
creations-chat 2020-07-05 08:19:32 <@456226577798135808>, this thing of course is bad for actual fight. Impossible to shot down anything flying even when it has 3 turrets and 1 missle battery.
creations-chat 2020-07-05 08:19:52 Yet it good for cleaning out turret campers on spawn.
creations-chat 2020-07-05 08:20:05 Still they will respawn again and again.
creations-chat 2020-07-05 08:50:02 Why does people use locked motors just for this?
creations-chat 2020-07-05 08:50:06 Bruh...
creations-chat 2020-07-05 13:23:34 Reason why there should be votekick.
creations-chat 2020-07-05 13:30:39 Well, this is the kind of people who play Plane Crazy only to be in PvP and wreck everyone as fast as possible.
creations-chat 2020-07-05 13:34:18 Nyet.
creations-chat 2020-07-05 14:27:42 <:thconking:535171057649188865>
creations-chat 2020-07-05 20:17:36 Giving lava splitter for everyone was a mistake.
creations-chat 2020-07-05 22:36:36 What cursed can I build else?
creations-chat 2020-07-06 09:40:56 Why the higher speed you has, the less damage you get?
creations-chat 2020-07-06 12:10:22 Bruh.
creations-chat 2020-07-06 12:10:29 I though something usefull ingame.
creations-chat 2020-07-06 17:31:11 <@456226577798135808>, how about fight 1 vs 1 on your Halcyon against mine Enigma frigate?
creations-chat 2020-07-06 17:34:37 Try using cameras.
creations-chat 2020-07-06 20:11:20 The end is nigh.
creations-chat 2020-07-06 20:21:05 Yes.
creations-chat 2020-07-06 20:23:41 One of many....... Ask XxKillerpro.
creations-chat 2020-07-06 20:36:20 :wheeze:
creations-chat 2020-07-06 20:36:49 
creations-chat 2020-07-06 20:36:56 <:lmfao:527971550360633393>
creations-chat 2020-07-06 20:40:59 For the greater good, can someone suggest an option in settings wich will automaticaly set gravity to zero after start if player brought gravity slider?
creations-chat 2020-07-06 20:57:48 Jliu, you will feel a stab in your brain when you do it 15-20 times per minute to test one thing on space build.
creations-chat 2020-07-07 07:35:43 Imagine game not bing hardcoded and having ability to use docking gear similar to Space Engineers. I mean this thing allows to sync both vehicles to each other and be together as one. Carrying planes, spacecrafts...
creations-chat 2020-07-07 07:36:19 Anyways, did someone got an idea how to make simple and effective autoloader for coilgun?
creations-chat 2020-07-07 07:36:44 Like, not splitting all the balls in one shot, but yeeting one per tap.
creations-chat 2020-07-07 07:37:53 Lmao, I don't understand, yeah.
creations-chat 2020-07-07 07:38:04 It better be 1 tap control.
creations-chat 2020-07-07 07:47:39 Looks pretty good. Will try to fit it into my frigate.
creations-chat 2020-07-07 07:48:21 I don't want to fill internals exept bridge.
creations-chat 2020-07-07 07:48:38 Because I have like 257/260.
creations-chat 2020-07-07 07:48:57 And have a principle to never make alt-accounts.
creations-chat 2020-07-07 07:49:29 So basicaly I'm stricting myself for endless suffering of removing good old builds to replace with something new.
creations-chat 2020-07-07 07:50:07 Yet that's funny how dev won't allow to buy additional memory, but allow creating multiaccounts.
creations-chat 2020-07-07 07:50:12 <:KEKW:670310537300672528>
creations-chat 2020-07-07 10:17:30 My nick is purple. Aw-w.
creations-chat 2020-07-07 16:46:38 A daily dose of cursed warthogs.
creations-chat 2020-07-07 16:47:57 Suggestions for another cursed warthog?
creations-chat 2020-07-07 16:48:20 Got it.
creations-chat 2020-07-07 16:48:24 Got help me.
creations-chat 2020-07-07 16:52:41 I think I will get new terrain specialist rank with new warthog.
creations-chat 2020-07-07 17:46:55 Help me.
creations-chat 2020-07-07 17:49:24 Help me.
creations-chat 2020-07-07 17:55:04 That was not meant for Jojo reference.
creations-chat 2020-07-07 17:55:08 But okay.
creations-chat 2020-07-07 17:59:28 Someone said tofu?
creations-chat 2020-07-07 17:59:55 I will make AE86 Warthog.
creations-chat 2020-07-07 18:08:16 Are you threating me?
creations-chat 2020-07-07 18:08:25 I'm making KV-2 warthog.
creations-chat 2020-07-07 18:08:30 <:lmfao:527971550360633393>
creations-chat 2020-07-07 18:19:19 That Yamato should be MACed.
creations-chat 2020-07-07 19:45:25 Why da hell any number and singular alphabet symbol being censored on text panels?..
creations-chat 2020-07-07 20:21:34 The problem is that people rarley check creations.
creations-chat 2020-07-07 20:21:44 So scores over 30 are exeptional.
creations-chat 2020-07-07 20:30:15 ~~Gotta repost frigate repaint and get golden designer badge.~~
creations-chat 2020-07-07 20:30:23 Yes.
creations-chat 2020-07-07 20:30:33 I made interior so no u.
creations-chat 2020-07-07 20:31:39 Y e l l o w.
creations-chat 2020-07-07 20:33:40 I'm gonna start commit kitten suffocation if you won't understand.
creations-chat 2020-07-08 08:56:35 Imagine better terrain made by plates instead of default roblox terrain generation.
creations-chat 2020-07-08 09:03:28 Nah, I mean terrain in style of Armored Patrol. It's semi-generated with random rocks, brushes placed.
creations-chat 2020-07-08 09:03:55 We could just use same style and add shitton of good details and additional things to test builds.
creations-chat 2020-07-08 20:45:52 Everyone remember my UNSC Enigma, right?
creations-chat 2020-07-08 20:46:16 I'm building full-scale now.
creations-chat 2020-07-08 20:46:28 Not an Plane Crazy, but still interesting.
creations-chat 2020-07-09 16:42:39 Meanwhile, my port of my Enigma class frigate from Plane Crazy in a full scale.
creations-chat 2020-07-09 16:43:09 God forgive me any sins.
creations-chat 2020-07-09 16:43:49 Just to understand the size - here I am standing in a hangar door.
creations-chat 2020-07-09 16:44:24 The next step after I finish hull and exterior details, I will start working on the internals.
creations-chat 2020-07-09 16:44:54 Like both hangars capable to park other vehicles, landing gear, crew interior, bridge, lift...
creations-chat 2020-07-09 16:44:57 And so on.
creations-chat 2020-07-09 16:47:55 Any suggestions?
creations-chat 2020-07-09 18:28:01 Some more update.
creations-chat 2020-07-09 18:28:28 ~~It's the size of Moon. When Plane Crazy will give us the same size limit?~~
creations-chat 2020-07-09 18:28:58 
creations-chat 2020-07-10 15:38:01 I am the first man who got terrain specialist rank *with a fort from a Halo map.*
creations-chat 2020-07-12 13:58:22 Remember my Cobra?
creations-chat 2020-07-12 13:58:49 This is she but on steroids.
creations-chat 2020-07-12 14:04:24 No.
creations-chat 2020-07-12 14:04:37 This is why this is not in creations.
creations-chat 2020-07-12 14:05:03 Plane crazy just don't allow more details, so I'm trying to port all the builds and show em.
creations-chat 2020-07-12 14:07:03 Camouflage.
creations-chat 2020-07-12 14:07:30 Try to make it less bicolor - take one of colors and reduce each number by 10-20.
creations-chat 2020-07-12 14:07:45 To make it darker/brighter.
creations-chat 2020-07-12 14:08:00 Also make fake shadows with this.
creations-chat 2020-07-12 14:09:11 This is how it looks.
creations-chat 2020-07-12 14:09:23 But try to use as much colors to make gradient less noticeable.
creations-chat 2020-07-12 14:43:53 Bruh, never liked planes.
creations-chat 2020-07-13 04:10:44 *Whoop.* No size and memory limit when.
creations-chat 2020-07-13 18:39:51 I like how people like something random like memes, yet something like that flying fortress/my frigate/any other heavily structured build wich take lots of efforts and time left with 25-30 upvotes max.
creations-chat 2020-07-13 18:46:14 e
creations-chat 2020-07-18 03:53:31 Some people are proud of what mediocre they made in 2 days and ask for upvotes.
creations-chat 2020-07-18 03:53:53 Meanwhile some random, not me, boi in about 5 hours only:
creations-chat 2020-07-18 03:54:06 
creations-chat 2020-07-18 03:54:18 
creations-chat 2020-07-18 03:54:33 Astro-Craft. Not BYSS, but difference in time.
creations-chat 2020-07-18 03:55:06 Astro-craft.
creations-chat 2020-07-18 03:55:21 Build your own ship.
creations-chat 2020-07-18 03:55:34 Basicaly Plane Crazy but no physics and F3X tools.
creations-chat 2020-07-18 03:55:40 Instead of pure cubes.
creations-chat 2020-07-18 03:55:45 Yes.
creations-chat 2020-07-18 03:55:47 It's roblox.
creations-chat 2020-07-18 03:56:12 
creations-chat 2020-07-18 03:56:25 
creations-chat 2020-07-18 03:56:38 Astro is harder in most of terms than PC.
creations-chat 2020-07-18 03:56:54 This is why it has less playerbase.
creations-chat 2020-07-18 03:57:00 Ya know. Roblox.
creations-chat 2020-07-18 03:57:29 Functionality. You fly on them.
creations-chat 2020-07-18 03:57:54 Well, you see what you can make with them.
creations-chat 2020-07-18 03:58:31 I just feel a deep scratching pain when someone says that they cool for making some 1000 block build in 2 days.
creations-chat 2020-07-18 04:02:35 I have this thing on wich I spent only 6 hours.
creations-chat 2020-07-18 04:02:46 
creations-chat 2020-07-18 04:04:02 Just an size difference. I'm that dot.
creations-chat 2020-07-18 04:04:39 A hangar.
creations-chat 2020-07-18 04:04:48 I can fit 4 of my Scout ships.
creations-chat 2020-07-18 04:04:54 Pool maybe never.
creations-chat 2020-07-18 04:04:57 Yes.
creations-chat 2020-07-18 04:05:09 But I didn't installed gravity generators.
creations-chat 2020-07-18 04:05:42 I also can show some stuff from BYSS.
creations-chat 2020-07-18 04:06:11 
creations-chat 2020-07-18 04:06:26 
creations-chat 2020-07-18 04:06:30 Build you own ship.
creations-chat 2020-07-18 04:06:46 More casual Astrocraft but also more features for mechanisms.
creations-chat 2020-07-18 04:07:22 
creations-chat 2020-07-18 04:07:41 
creations-chat 2020-07-18 04:08:16 Elite Dangerous.
creations-chat 2020-07-18 04:08:18 HUD.
creations-chat 2020-07-18 04:08:25 Simple but enough to look.
creations-chat 2020-07-18 04:08:44 It's an old build to compate with my Scout.
creations-chat 2020-07-18 04:08:58 I also have a small station!
creations-chat 2020-07-18 04:09:01 Wich took really 4 days.
creations-chat 2020-07-18 04:09:30 Almost the same - F3X, some more vanilla.
creations-chat 2020-07-18 04:09:37 And also lot of useless stuff.
creations-chat 2020-07-18 23:28:52 Downvote this pls/upvote this pls be like: wearing clown suit and begging for more upvotes.
creations-chat 2020-07-18 23:31:01 Meanwhile I'm building some massive things. This freighter over empty hull is 2300 tiles long. The hull under it is 3500 tiles long and will be capable to carry typical air carrier wich are popular in Plane crazy. Or 4 of them. Or maybe 6 if I want.
creations-chat 2020-07-18 23:33:43 Player size comparison to a smol freighter. Try to find a player on it.
bug-reports 2020-07-18 23:37:02 Remove damn FPS compensation for physics. It's annoying how big build could go up to 12k speed and be outrun by some tutorial plane with one super engine. Let big things fly at full speed with any FPS.
bug-reports 2020-07-18 23:38:18 If someone don't understand - the bigger is your build, the slower your parts will be. This results to a moment when large structures will be slower on same speed as any small and FPS-light build.
creations-chat 2020-07-18 23:39:04 This is not Plane Crazy.
creations-chat 2020-07-18 23:39:29 I'm just dropping sometimes my builds here because I've ran out of memory in PC.
creations-chat 2020-07-18 23:39:40 Astrocraft.
creations-chat 2020-07-18 23:39:59 Plane Crazy but space. With no air friction.
creations-chat 2020-07-18 23:40:05 Yes.
creations-chat 2020-07-18 23:40:21 Use grab tool to line up.
creations-chat 2020-07-18 23:40:41 And also there is T button to align blocks together.
creations-chat 2020-07-18 23:42:12 I would like to downvote it too, but I gained tolerance to new builders.
creations-chat 2020-07-18 23:42:24 <:ElonSad:573361014112780303>
creations-chat 2020-07-18 23:42:37 Details.
creations-chat 2020-07-18 23:42:47 Your starship is to minimalistic.
creations-chat 2020-07-18 23:43:02 I can suggest to use some shadow-simulating paint.
creations-chat 2020-07-18 23:43:35 Just take color, then decrease each number by 10-20.
creations-chat 2020-07-18 23:44:00 255-255-255 to 245-245-245. On your hull.
creations-chat 2020-07-18 23:44:10 Try to add slight diversity on it.
creations-chat 2020-07-18 23:44:24 Because to slim and bland surface is unattractive.
creations-chat 2020-07-18 23:44:28 Yeah.
creations-chat 2020-07-18 23:44:40 You can add burnt hull effect near engines.
creations-chat 2020-07-18 23:45:03 Way darker on the bottom with a short gradient back to white.
creations-chat 2020-07-18 23:45:28 But this if you not used 1x4 wedge.
creations-chat 2020-07-18 23:45:38 Because 1x4 are bad for gradient.
creations-chat 2020-07-18 23:49:31 Replace some 1x4 wide wedges with default 1x1 wedges and make some gradient.
creations-chat 2020-07-18 23:49:51 Also I can suggest simulating worn paint on top of your starship.
creations-chat 2020-07-18 23:50:18 Yes.
creations-chat 2020-07-18 23:50:25 You used beam wedges.
creations-chat 2020-07-18 23:50:44 Just replace some with 1x1 on the bottom.
creations-chat 2020-07-18 23:51:16 Also lifehack - 1x1 blocks are more survivable than 1x4 beams.
creations-chat 2020-07-18 23:51:27 Because both have same HP pool.
creations-chat 2020-07-18 23:52:02 But you can place 4 blocks instead of one beam and enemy will destroy one block instead of making huge gap.
creations-chat 2020-07-18 23:52:20 True too.
creations-chat 2020-07-18 23:52:31 But in PvP 1x1 matters more.
creations-chat 2020-07-18 23:52:39 Yet PvP in Plane Crazy is cancer.
creations-chat 2020-07-18 23:53:29 Looks neat.
creations-chat 2020-07-18 23:53:59 Yet upper part is still looks bland.
creations-chat 2020-07-18 23:57:20 Some tip if you going to build large space ship builds - use wood material for hull instead of metal.
creations-chat 2020-07-18 23:57:35 On a big scale it looks overall better.
creations-chat 2020-07-18 23:58:27 On small builds - use metal.
creations-chat 2020-07-18 23:58:57 Big like my frigate use wood.
creations-chat 2020-07-18 23:59:27 Looks good.
creations-chat 2020-07-19 00:04:55 Meanwhile I'm progressing with a belly part of my capital.
creations-chat 2020-07-19 00:07:59 Astro. Craft.
creations-chat 2020-07-19 00:08:05 I wrote that before.
creations-chat 2020-07-19 00:08:28 It is orientired only at space, so no wheels, no wings.
creations-chat 2020-07-19 00:32:17 Remember my sentence about that my capital ship can fill itself with some carriers? There is a hangar enterance size.
creations-chat 2020-07-19 00:32:43 *Fill me up with your aircarriers senpai~~*
creations-chat 2020-07-19 01:07:12 No wedges on star killer be like: bruh.
bug-reports 2020-07-19 01:08:29 > Just get a better pc lol
Be like playing HL:A on my laptop and you telling me to buy "something better"?
Roblox fault is roblox fault.
creations-chat 2020-07-19 01:09:49 Idk.
creations-chat 2020-07-19 01:09:55 Those mortal dudes I think.
creations-chat 2020-07-20 00:27:30 Someone: IvE BuIlT AnOtHeR FaLcOn HeAvY.
True builders:
creations-chat 2020-07-20 00:28:09 The best part of it that it's actually have artificial gravity made by rotation, not by placing gravity generators.
creations-chat 2020-07-20 00:30:29 Roblox.
creations-chat 2020-07-20 00:30:49 Or better known as Astrocraft.
creations-chat 2020-07-20 00:31:24 Still a creation.
creations-chat 2020-07-20 00:31:45 I just don't have any memory left in Plane Crazy to keep building.
creations-chat 2020-07-20 00:32:51 I don't sit in AC server. Not even joined. Plus, I'm showing people what they could actually build instead of another copy of plane or rocket. Or a heli.
creations-chat 2020-07-25 08:31:43 Believe or not - making another plane via wedges is not enough.
creations-chat 2020-07-25 08:31:50 <:WeirdChamp:670867805176070145>
creations-chat 2020-07-25 08:32:55 Try using half-wedge.
bug-reports 2020-07-25 08:37:18 <@628393318874873886>, conveyers themselves work pretty cursed - as tank tracks they oftenly start to load CPU up to the sky and the only way to stop it sometimes - ride back, lift conveyers from the ground and let them delag or simply respawn.

Conveyers are cursed.
creations-chat 2020-07-25 08:37:56 Dude, why do you need to say that youre russian?
creations-chat 2020-07-25 08:39:15 Also phone sometimes cannot process images in discord.
creations-chat 2020-07-25 08:39:25 Or videos.
creations-chat 2020-07-25 08:39:35 And just crash when you try to play them.
creations-chat 2020-07-25 08:52:45 Why the hell people love using motor lock, lmao.
creations-chat 2020-07-25 08:53:21 We can literally build this with with default use of halh-blocks, half-wedges and proper hands.
creations-chat 2020-07-25 08:54:06 All what I see in motor lock is artificial creation of difficulty for structure of build. Small details can be made by half wedges too.
creations-chat 2020-07-25 08:54:51 Never seen anything that you can't do without it.
creations-chat 2020-07-25 08:55:04 Exept for tutorial ball cockpit flyers.
creations-chat 2020-07-25 08:55:47 Okay, compressed bombs is the second one
creations-chat 2020-07-25 08:55:52 Something else?

creations-chat 2020-07-25 08:58:07 Dimas, I can make same modern form by using only half-blocks and half-wedges. ~~Yet I don't need.~~
creations-chat 2020-07-25 08:58:29 Quality is bad on the picture.
creations-chat 2020-07-25 08:58:40 ^

creations-chat 2020-07-25 08:59:26 0.9 blocks for no-weld.
creations-chat 2020-07-25 08:59:31 Lmao.
creations-chat 2020-07-25 08:59:52 You can browse my builds by search.
creations-chat 2020-07-25 09:00:24 I don't have expirience by your standart dude.

creations-chat 2020-07-25 09:16:37 He left but I seen how he just copied 2 builds near him instantly one by one, right even to the colors.
creations-chat 2020-07-25 09:17:48 Not checked this - he was on the other side of the map for about 10 seconds or so.
creations-chat 2020-07-25 09:18:17 Seems like someone managed to make build steal technology.
creations-chat 2020-07-25 09:18:35 Don't use motors for lags. <:pain:644301805534183464>
creations-chat 2020-07-25 09:19:25 Or a better one - get a NASA PC because Plane Crazy got all the physic calculation to work on your PC.
creations-chat 2020-07-25 09:19:57 ~~Prob won't help because Roblox itself a coded trash IDK how it plays.~~

creations-chat 2020-07-25 15:04:08 If someone will say that it's to big to park near home and unload, then we will land it on the house itself and turn it into dust to rebuild 3 or 4 of them from all the cargo wich it can carry on it.

creations-chat 2020-08-03 04:16:18 Motor lock is gay.
creations-chat 2020-08-03 04:16:44 Why not just ask devs to add some wedges wich will work together?
creations-chat 2020-08-03 04:18:37 Make.
creations-chat 2020-08-03 04:19:29 > motorlock helps with details....
And makes you gay. And also increases amount of parts, create intense lag if destroyed in PvP.
creations-chat 2020-08-03 04:19:48 And also gay.
creations-chat 2020-08-03 04:20:36 True men use all the wedges they got from dev or adapt without them.
creations-chat 2020-08-03 04:21:04 Who stops you from improvizing?

creations-chat 2020-08-03 04:35:25 Bfg*
creations-chat 2020-08-03 04:35:35 Looks more like BFG.
creations-chat 2020-08-03 04:36:07 I played only CE, Reach and ODST.
creations-chat 2020-08-03 04:36:09 <:what:644996672048463942>
creations-chat 2020-08-03 04:36:20 I don't remember it.
creations-chat 2020-08-03 04:36:24 At the end.
creations-chat 2020-08-03 04:36:42 I more go shoot shoot ships with it than looking at it.
creations-chat 2020-08-03 04:37:18 Chonky big.
creations-chat 2020-08-03 04:37:22 Bfg.
creations-chat 2020-08-03 04:37:49 Btw, make coilguns usefull in PvP. Imagine sniping with them from flying island.
creations-chat 2020-08-03 04:39:00 Because explosive balls in coilguns are worthless. They bounce and explode with a desync.
creations-chat 2020-08-03 04:39:22 I want explosive balls explode on contact.
creations-chat 2020-08-03 04:40:27 Nah, to big projectile.
creations-chat 2020-08-03 04:40:42 At max he can do autolader with smaller projectiles.
creations-chat 2020-08-03 04:40:47 Like explosive balls.
creations-chat 2020-08-03 04:41:20 Autoloader. I can show ya wich I use in my frigate.
creations-chat 2020-08-03 04:41:31 Aha.
creations-chat 2020-08-03 04:41:38 🤔
creations-chat 2020-08-03 04:41:52 Btw make explosive balls great again.
creations-chat 2020-08-03 04:42:40 "Explode on contact" actually just set explosion on delay with 0.1 second, do not explode them instantly.
creations-chat 2020-08-03 04:43:08 So on high speed they have time to bounce off the enemy and fly randomly to explode in a meter away.
creations-chat 2020-08-03 04:43:52 *True men use their eyes and calculate to shoot.*
creations-chat 2020-08-03 04:43:56 <:what:644996672048463942>
creations-chat 2020-08-03 04:44:48 Yeah, I meet some dudes who say that anything you build in here are automaticaly planes because the game is called "Plane crazy"
creations-chat 2020-08-03 04:44:51 <:KEKW:670310537300672528>
creations-chat 2020-08-03 04:45:00 I should use this bait too.
creations-chat 2020-08-03 04:45:18 I made my cursed astolfo bean to fly.
creations-chat 2020-08-03 04:45:37 It don't have motors.
creations-chat 2020-08-03 04:45:55 Chonky.
creations-chat 2020-08-03 04:46:52 Btw, I have a good collection of cursed warthogs before Inferno lord has heard us out and made longest warthog video.
creations-chat 2020-08-03 04:47:17 I made it right after Cursed halo vid.
creations-chat 2020-08-03 04:47:25 Then I made warthog limoer.
creations-chat 2020-08-03 04:47:30 And wide warthog.
creations-chat 2020-08-03 04:47:36 And widelimoethog.
creations-chat 2020-08-03 04:47:53 And then I made tallhog, made a planehog, trainhog.
creations-chat 2020-08-03 04:48:21 I modified my UNSC frigate and turned it into a hybrid of warthog and frigate.
creations-chat 2020-08-03 04:48:32 But had to delete it because of memory limit.
creations-chat 2020-08-03 04:49:29 All what I saved is only widelonghog, classig limo with RvB warpaint and playing polka. Because I have 259.6 out of 260.
creations-chat 2020-08-03 04:50:05 Nyet.
creations-chat 2020-08-03 04:50:13 I can make it again tho.
creations-chat 2020-08-03 04:50:18 If I have time.
creations-chat 2020-08-03 04:50:35 Long live the cursed warthog community.
creations-chat 2020-08-03 04:51:14 Actually I can try to build a longest possible warthog in space engineers.
creations-chat 2020-08-03 04:51:20 <:KEKW:670310537300672528>
creations-chat 2020-08-03 04:51:32 I will drop it from orbit.
creations-chat 2020-08-03 04:52:26 Btw, any suggestions for hogs?
creations-chat 2020-08-03 04:52:57 *They're shown here.*
creations-chat 2020-08-03 04:53:03 *As nicknames.*
creations-chat 2020-08-03 04:53:47 I have principle to not use multiple accounts. In other way I could have account full of warthog, start to rebuild Elite:D stuff.

creations-chat 2020-08-03 20:11:17 P a y t a x e s.
creations-chat 2020-08-03 20:14:01 You know the rules and so do I.
creations-chat 2020-08-03 20:15:45 This is why I'm wondering why no one suggest more wedges. There are literally almost no wedges to connect 1/2 blocks with full blocks exept half-wedge.
creations-chat 2020-08-03 20:16:44 ~~Btw in Space engineers there is the same problem with lack of wedges. I need to use mod to fill the gap.~~
creations-chat 2020-08-03 20:17:12 All of this could be fixed by replacing building from cubes to F3X <:KEKW:670310537300672528>
creations-chat 2020-08-03 20:17:50 F3X has literally advantages in **any** sphere over PC build mode.
creations-chat 2020-08-03 20:18:29 PC building is basicaly only placing blocks, not moving.
creations-chat 2020-08-03 20:19:33 The only part I see why Plane Crazy is not using F3X - it is more complex for typical roblox kiddo wich are 80% of playerbase in PC.
creations-chat 2020-08-03 20:20:21 So using build mode with higher learning curve will make a huge drop.
creations-chat 2020-08-03 20:21:14 And also F3X is unusable on phones. Btw only ~~braindead~~ masochists play on phone.
creations-chat 2020-08-03 20:22:03 But who stops Rickje from creating a basic ingame F3X tutorial? Only God himself.
creations-chat 2020-08-03 20:24:57 This will solve all the major problems - size limit, intense CPU load because of large amount of parts, lack of block forms.

Also switching won't work - PC uses upgraded vanilla build mode wich is basicaly limited to a plots. I remember the same build system in old game about zombies. The difference is that PC allows blocks to be physics enabled when you start a flight.
creations-chat 2020-08-03 20:25:22 F3X builds right with enabled physics.
creations-chat 2020-08-03 20:26:07 And I'm sure it don't use vanilla coded build mode. It is more like roblox studio tools adapted for a game use.
creations-chat 2020-08-03 20:28:18 Nick, it is just literally a wing plate with attached engines and control surfaces. All what I can say is that people are not are you and won't upvote it only because it should be a dorito in your mind.
creations-chat 2020-08-03 20:29:04 Orange triangle wing with engines wich I can speedbuild in 1 minute. Max 2.
creations-chat 2020-08-03 20:29:41 This won't work unless you make them with some interesting mechanics or good looking.

creations-chat 2020-08-07 21:41:04 Indeed.
creations-chat 2020-08-07 21:41:27 There must be some kind of light moderation wich will let you in the CS.
creations-chat 2020-08-07 21:42:07 And imagine putting trash into CS to get lvl1 rank.

creations-chat 2020-08-07 21:53:10 And lower the upvote requirement for hall of fame.
creations-chat 2020-08-07 21:53:20 Because HoF is static as heck.
creations-chat 2020-08-07 21:53:35 And some good builds can't even get 40 sometimes.
creations-chat 2020-08-07 21:55:00 Yeah. Timezones are ghei.

creations-chat 2020-08-07 21:55:15 <:what:644996672048463942>
creations-chat 2020-08-07 21:56:37 Btw, the logic sometimes can go rogue.
creations-chat 2020-08-07 21:56:53 So people upvote more weird stuff than high time consuming stuff.
creations-chat 2020-08-07 21:57:01 As I had before.

creations-chat 2020-08-07 22:00:02 Ships are ghei.
creations-chat 2020-08-07 22:00:20 Because they cause so much damn physics throttling.
creations-chat 2020-08-07 22:00:35 Water physics is a true hell definition.
creations-chat 2020-08-07 22:01:20 Damn, PC is more cursed because of roblox engine.
creations-chat 2020-08-07 22:02:10 When my VTOL flies at speed of 500 and get outrun by a tutorial plane with 6 guns infront of it because of physics throttling.
creations-chat 2020-08-07 22:02:14 <:KEKW:670310537300672528>
creations-chat 2020-08-07 22:03:40 Even in Space Engineers my physics flies like butter with bread - I have like 5 stations wich spin for artificial gravity around themselves (they are not static grids) and **also** orbit around planets near gas giant. I love orbiter SE mod.
creations-chat 2020-08-07 22:04:03 Yes.
creations-chat 2020-08-07 22:04:41 CPU when you launch roblox be like:
creations-chat 2020-08-07 22:05:18 I'm just curious how hot phones are when you play on them some PC.
creations-chat 2020-08-07 22:05:36 <:IntendedFeatureX:706289545250996235>
creations-chat 2020-08-07 22:23:11 Someone still love Evamgelion...
creations-chat 2020-08-07 22:23:50 Btw, someone should make hardcore sci-fi stuff.

creations-chat 2020-08-10 12:07:01 <:pain:644301805534183464>

creations-chat 2020-08-10 13:28:45 "Yarrr and a bottle of vodka."
creations-chat 2020-08-10 13:29:22 General sounds gay.
creations-chat 2020-08-10 13:31:01 Why people have carrierophilia is a mystery.
creations-chat 2020-08-10 13:31:57 There is literally no mechanics to use as carrier stuff.
creations-chat 2020-08-10 13:32:01 No docking stuff.
creations-chat 2020-08-10 14:25:10 Basicaly Creations channel in a nutshell.
creations-chat 2020-08-10 14:26:56 Btw, I find planes/carriers unoriginal in the same way. They all looks the same with a bit of different details like wing form/plates/paint.
creations-chat 2020-08-17 06:13:41 I can make an meme YT channel about creations.
creations-chat 2020-08-17 06:13:46 Like.
creations-chat 2020-08-17 06:14:06 "Hello everyone this is your daily dose of similar planes and carriers."

creations-chat 2020-08-17 06:15:53 I mean, no use of cheap builds to mine, extract resources, etc.
creations-chat 2020-08-18 08:39:32 I didn't got 5 with my frigate, so your Paris won't too. People don't upvote something isn't a meme or a plane/rocket that much.
creations-chat 2020-08-18 08:39:59 <@!200793484053970944>
creations-chat 2020-08-18 08:40:51 He look like plumber.

bug-reports 2020-08-22 12:31:03 Everyone is gangsta untill my airboat bugs out and starts flying like plane. Literally with no helium or any stuff it just starts flying after spawn like that.
bug-reports 2020-08-22 14:39:19 Dude, did you seen gravity slider?
bug-reports 2020-08-22 14:39:32 I specially slided it to the zero and to the 300.
bug-reports 2020-08-22 14:39:42 <@456226577798135808>, smartn't
bug-reports 2020-08-22 14:40:25 It is literally happening only to my airboat randomly when I launch it.
bug-reports 2020-08-22 14:40:46 Idk how to recreate it, but this is the reason why I keep it.
bug-reports 2020-08-22 14:41:16 Only 2 at turrets.
bug-reports 2020-08-22 14:41:24 Turret*
bug-reports 2020-08-22 14:41:48 They are fixed at 25 degrees only, I didn't had turret before and had same effect.
bug-reports 2020-08-22 14:43:03 As I said - not a motor2. The reason is unknown, btw it occures only with airboat no matter how I edit it.
bug-reports 2020-08-22 14:43:43 Maybe it's just a gulangula blessing.
bug-reports 2020-08-22 14:50:15 He's just a dum-dum maybe.
creations-chat 2020-08-29 14:32:19 Don't use shredder bugs at all. It's a cheesy way to win in this autistic PvP.
creations-chat 2020-08-29 14:38:27 Btw, it's not PC, but I made another buildo. An UES Safe Travels from RoR2.
creations-chat 2020-08-29 14:39:31 
creations-chat 2020-08-29 14:39:55 Just because why not. There is an original.
creations-chat 2020-08-29 14:52:31 Risk of Rain 2.
creations-chat 2020-08-29 14:52:44 ok
creations-chat 2020-08-29 15:01:11 Ye.
creations-chat 2020-08-29 15:01:57 Btw Astrocraft sucks.
creations-chat 2020-08-29 15:02:11 ~~PC too with it's optimization.~~
creations-chat 2020-08-29 15:09:05 Quick meme for yall.
creations-chat 2020-08-29 15:12:21 ST ships are mostly saucers with attached "engines"
creations-chat 2020-08-29 15:13:16 Like, really.
creations-chat 2020-08-29 15:14:02 And I like how they call it "realistic" because some already dead dude (rip great scientist) said that he likes some aspects in a whole franschise.
creations-chat 2020-08-29 15:39:17 Some more stuff from AC.
creations-chat 2020-08-29 15:39:27 
creations-chat 2020-08-29 15:47:25 Mp4 be like.
creations-chat 2020-08-29 18:08:56 Who needs gacha when you can have gachi?
creations-chat 2020-08-29 18:09:49 Not gonna lie Froblox, but you're missing all the fun.
creations-chat 2020-08-29 18:09:55 Of a true memery.
creations-chat 2020-08-29 18:10:21 And also a great community wich can make memes from a very outdated neolitic-age videos.
creations-chat 2020-08-29 18:10:33 Gachi is not gay.
creations-chat 2020-08-29 18:10:54 It is to manly to be gay. And gacha is gay.
creations-chat 2020-08-29 18:12:26 https://youtu.be/BJ0xBCwkg3E
creations-chat 2020-08-29 18:14:13 Btw trains, wheelies with suspension are worthless in PC.
creations-chat 2020-08-29 18:14:51 Devs are to lazy to make proper terrain instead of almost plain landscape with use of default roblox voxel generation.
creations-chat 2020-08-29 18:15:15 And also train tracks are to short.
creations-chat 2020-08-29 18:15:58 That would be better if Rick used not voxel terrain, but built it like in Armored Patrol it was made - by triangles.
creations-chat 2020-08-29 18:16:12 Yeah, Ik.
creations-chat 2020-08-29 18:16:50 The game is running only on starting hype.
creations-chat 2020-08-29 18:17:43 But as you know, it kinds sucks because it uses outdated vanilla roblox building system wich I remember from 2012-13 games.
creations-chat 2020-08-29 18:17:48 "Build to survive"
creations-chat 2020-08-29 18:18:02 Where you have a plot and have tool to stamp blocks.
creations-chat 2020-08-29 18:18:14 Pretty much this system is used rn instead of F3X.
creations-chat 2020-08-29 18:25:21 What stops them from making moar stuff? Basicaly time.
creations-chat 2020-08-29 18:25:30 They are people too.
creations-chat 2020-08-29 18:26:10 I mean, Rikje is a human and he has his own things IRL and probably he can't make to much in short amount of time.
creations-chat 2020-08-29 18:26:37 On the other hand I don't understand why he don't want to get moar stuff to code/model/etc.
creations-chat 2020-08-29 18:27:36 Bruh.
creations-chat 2020-08-29 18:27:57 There are games wich are being developed by one dude but faster than light.
creations-chat 2020-08-29 18:28:16 Mostly are indies.
creations-chat 2020-08-29 18:29:47 Well.
creations-chat 2020-08-29 18:30:10 Bigger amount of moderators for discord more than coders for the game itself talks for itself.
creations-chat 2020-08-29 18:31:40 Btw idk why Rickje and mad didn't picked F3X as main building system.
creations-chat 2020-08-29 18:34:08 Make more wedges lol.
creations-chat 2020-08-29 18:34:25 We don't have inner wedge wich connects with 3 wedges on each side.
creations-chat 2020-08-29 18:34:27 Only 2.
creations-chat 2020-08-29 18:35:01 Btw I can't make this stuff with default roblox building system.
creations-chat 2020-08-29 18:35:17 This is why I'm prefering goddamn F3X.
creations-chat 2020-08-29 18:35:27 I can stretch blocks, resize em.
creations-chat 2020-08-29 18:36:44 Lmao, hellium tanks don't need a model. You just take 1x4 block, change it's color in code and give it -4 weight or so.
creations-chat 2020-08-29 18:36:54 Water jets are worthles.
creations-chat 2020-08-29 18:37:20 Lmao.
creations-chat 2020-08-29 18:37:25 Probably yes.
creations-chat 2020-08-29 18:37:32 But at the same time.
creations-chat 2020-08-29 18:37:39 They looks to weird for proper builds.
creations-chat 2020-08-29 18:37:46 But fine for current PvP state.
creations-chat 2020-08-29 18:38:06 Btw PvP should not exist in PC.
creations-chat 2020-08-29 18:38:11 Atleast in current state.
creations-chat 2020-08-29 18:38:36 Make water jet blocky.
creations-chat 2020-08-29 18:38:44 Who need those stands?
creations-chat 2020-08-29 18:39:07 Why do we need a round block in a blocky build mode?
creations-chat 2020-08-29 18:39:55 They do nothing.
creations-chat 2020-08-29 18:40:06 I tested and they do nothing.
creations-chat 2020-08-29 18:40:17 They are here just because yes.
creations-chat 2020-08-29 18:40:44 Make them a full block sized.
creations-chat 2020-08-29 18:40:49 Instead of a cylinder.
creations-chat 2020-08-29 18:41:00 So you can integrate them in hull.
creations-chat 2020-08-29 18:41:20 They already take block size.
creations-chat 2020-08-29 18:41:25 Just make their model blocky.
creations-chat 2020-08-29 18:41:27 Not round.
creations-chat 2020-08-29 18:41:29 They look ugly.
creations-chat 2020-08-29 18:42:01 Their roundness doesen't look good at any build exept some weird PvP stuff.
creations-chat 2020-08-29 18:42:33 Just make gun block longer.
creations-chat 2020-08-29 18:42:46 Dudes, he's not a coder.
creations-chat 2020-08-29 18:42:51 He could only model.
creations-chat 2020-08-29 18:43:13 Then code a proper PvP for PC Imao.
creations-chat 2020-08-29 18:43:30 Ah yes, carrier trash once again.
creations-chat 2020-08-30 18:42:38 Haha.
creations-chat 2020-08-30 18:42:51 No one got the reference btw.
creations-chat 2020-08-31 01:45:31 Server crash attempts be like.
creations-chat 2020-08-31 01:47:21 Remember our DDoS heroes.

creations-chat 2020-09-01 13:32:02 So I called it Type-8 Bulk Carrier.
creations-chat 2020-09-01 13:32:52 My most upvoted was goddamn airboat from HL2.
creations-chat 2020-09-01 13:33:06 And also take this cursed thing.
creations-chat 2020-09-01 13:33:52 Lack of upvotes on my builds is mostly because I post them when whole europe sleeps.
creations-chat 2020-09-01 13:33:58 Как же я устал от этого, да.
creations-chat 2020-09-01 13:43:46 Make a drop pod from RoR. Let's make a 4-player drop into the flying island.
creations-chat 2020-09-01 13:43:52 And die from random elite mob.
creations-chat 2020-09-01 13:46:58 Btw why the hell is this dude don't have any physics throttling?
creations-chat 2020-09-01 13:47:26 My smol VTOL with only 725 blocks causes major throttling.
creations-chat 2020-09-01 13:52:31 Can damn hoverengines cause major throttling?
creations-chat 2020-09-01 13:54:06 I mean hover engines.
creations-chat 2020-09-01 13:54:18 Wich are an alternative to conveyer and magnetic engines.
creations-chat 2020-09-01 13:54:33 They are weakier but atleast have speed control like default engines.
creations-chat 2020-09-01 21:18:50 Finally I can build moar some f'urking big builds.
creations-chat 2020-09-01 21:19:03 Without crying about my principle of not using alt'accounts.
creations-chat 2020-09-02 10:29:40 Most planes look the same.
creations-chat 2020-09-02 10:30:05 Idk what people find interesting in making classical working mechanism like plane.
creations-chat 2020-09-02 10:30:16 Why not try and make something exotix.
creations-chat 2020-09-02 10:30:39 Like I updated my old M-44 Hammerhead with suspension.
creations-chat 2020-09-02 10:30:49 *Suspension on a hovertank, yeah.*
creations-chat 2020-09-02 10:32:07 Actually I tried to make smaller Hammerhead because big one creates throttling like my Vtol.
creations-chat 2020-09-02 10:32:21 But it just won't work as intended.
creations-chat 2020-09-02 10:32:49 Hover engines spin it on any turn.
creations-chat 2020-09-02 10:33:16 Like Newton in his coffin when Roblox physics started to exist.
creations-chat 2020-09-02 10:35:25 Btw imagine PvP not being trash.
creations-chat 2020-09-02 10:35:44 And stacked guns will have alternatives.
creations-chat 2020-09-02 10:36:05 Like cannons.
creations-chat 2020-09-02 10:36:08 Or heavy MG.
creations-chat 2020-09-02 10:40:54 I mean PvP is unplayable just because of roblox engine.
creations-chat 2020-09-02 10:41:07 Large builds have disadvantage against small one.
creations-chat 2020-09-02 10:41:41 Physical throttling is a real thing and also multiple turrets are nearly impossible to hit airborne target.
creations-chat 2020-09-02 10:42:29 Just because there is no any kind of aim-assist wich will correct point where turrets aim so they will focus on one point instead of background.
creations-chat 2020-09-02 10:43:03 Also realistic hydraulics is bruh in terms of it will large in a scale to a character.
creations-chat 2020-09-02 10:43:46 I always try to make builds 1:1 scale on a size of player.
creations-chat 2020-09-02 10:44:03 But actually it works badly because of blocky building system.
creations-chat 2020-09-02 10:44:29 F3X is a cure to this problem.
creations-chat 2020-09-02 10:45:17 But well, seems like PC has a way of being only old "stamp" system.
creations-chat 2020-09-02 10:45:21 From Sandbox.
creations-chat 2020-09-02 10:47:09 Btw F3X is more flexible and optimized than blocky system.
creations-chat 2020-09-02 10:51:55 Robloxian scale is just not my thing. Interiors feel just to empty.
creations-chat 2020-09-02 10:52:01 Or low detailed at max.
creations-chat 2020-09-02 10:52:39 And you can't make compact builds. That means properly working hydraulics will be in the size of 5:1 from player.
creations-chat 2020-09-02 11:04:30 Btw I never use motor locks.
creations-chat 2020-09-02 11:05:12 Just because I don't like abusing mechanics to fit more engines or try to make another wedge.
creations-chat 2020-09-02 11:05:26 I am traveller in the time.
creations-chat 2020-09-02 11:05:33 <:KEKW:670310537300672528>
creations-chat 2020-09-02 11:16:49 Actually.
creations-chat 2020-09-02 11:17:05 I have an idea for the map - giant wreck of the space ship.
creations-chat 2020-09-02 11:17:46 Yep. Half of it is in the ground, a half-restored crater
creations-chat 2020-09-02 11:17:52 Somewhere filled with water.
creations-chat 2020-09-02 11:18:20 Dude, I gave enough sugs.
creations-chat 2020-09-02 11:22:45 Something like that.
creations-chat 2020-09-02 11:23:11 Dude, iside of Aurora you can't fly.
creations-chat 2020-09-02 11:23:58 But those "half-decayed" giant wrecks could be an interesting track to ride inside of, fly inside of it.
creations-chat 2020-09-02 11:24:26 Aurora got hit only in front.
creations-chat 2020-09-02 11:24:58 It is mostly for exploration on feet.
creations-chat 2020-09-02 11:25:10 Something smaller than my suggestion would work like Aurora.
creations-chat 2020-09-02 11:25:23 Like crashed frigate with labyrynths in it.
creations-chat 2020-09-02 11:26:18 Dude.
creations-chat 2020-09-02 11:26:25 It's not for atmosphere.
creations-chat 2020-09-02 18:14:08 Finally some good funcking shint. I can make ***LOT*** of new space ships.
creations-chat 2020-09-02 18:28:56 Your builds do move?
creations-chat 2020-09-02 18:28:59 <:what:644996672048463942>
creations-chat 2020-09-02 19:43:26 You'd better make cursed warhogs. Fulfill your destiny in what I failed.
creations-chat 2020-09-02 19:46:18 Warhogs are cars from a game about how one buffed dude in nerf armor destroys whole parasitic ecosysyem and get betrayed by his anime virtual girl.
creations-chat 2020-09-02 19:46:46 I hope he will find new love with his ayy lmao friend in a shiny terraria armor.
creations-chat 2020-09-02 19:46:52 #nohomo
creations-chat 2020-09-02 19:47:57 I should describe Plane crazy in the same manner.
creations-chat 2020-09-02 19:49:41 A game about how bricky small lego men with edgy skins build a white wunderwaffle with use of fading blocks, pepper sprayers, piss lasers and hotdog launchers to yeet each other in degenerate vs degenerate mode.
creations-chat 2020-09-02 19:49:55 P e r f e c t.
creations-chat 2020-09-02 19:50:08 Just the whole PvP mode in a nutshell.
creations-chat 2020-09-02 19:50:17 Ah yes, I forgot something.
creations-chat 2020-09-02 19:51:27 They do all of it while there are flying razors and also some strange people who managed to insert some 3D models wich constantly scream how this game is a big gay.
creations-chat 2020-09-02 19:52:05 And also all of this constantly explodes because some edgy kid makes a budget version of creepers.
creations-chat 2020-09-02 19:52:08 Wich can fly.
creations-chat 2020-09-02 19:52:11 And swim.
creations-chat 2020-09-02 19:52:19 And ride on their round leggs.
creations-chat 2020-09-02 19:53:21 I can't call default wheels in any other means.
creations-chat 2020-09-02 19:54:12 I approve.
creations-chat 2020-09-02 19:54:17 Like.
creations-chat 2020-09-02 19:54:36 I will probably lose my license of being straight for that.
creations-chat 2020-09-02 19:54:54 Actually you won't beat the record.
creations-chat 2020-09-02 19:55:08 But you can make a record of making most upvoted dumb shit.
creations-chat 2020-09-02 19:55:28 So let's make that dudes.
creations-chat 2020-09-02 19:55:41 The record of downvotes is around 160.

creations-chat 2020-09-02 19:56:05 They made some WW2 bomber.
creations-chat 2020-09-02 19:56:11 Wich was a stick with guns.
creations-chat 2020-09-02 19:56:16 And small wings.
creations-chat 2020-09-02 19:56:29 And tnt attached to a disconnectors.
creations-chat 2020-09-02 19:57:00 And the whole design mentally says that you just will become gay if you upvote that.

creations-chat 2020-09-04 16:09:25 When I loaded save and it was a mess instead of a ship.
creations-chat 2020-09-04 16:09:53 Imagine wasting 2 days in some random game with F3X.
creations-chat 2020-09-04 16:10:16 F3X is an alternate building system.
creations-chat 2020-09-04 16:10:32 Not outdated like Plane Crazy uses with it's stamp tool from 2010.
creations-chat 2020-09-04 16:11:21 It has imaginable grider if you use proper numbers.

creations-chat 2020-09-04 16:23:03 It is basicaly 2010 years old game wich was Plane Crazy dad but without physics.
creations-chat 2020-09-04 16:23:19 And with lots of planets.
creations-chat 2020-09-04 16:23:45 Roblox in a nutshell.
creations-chat 2020-09-04 16:23:55 Just search "Space" word.
creations-chat 2020-09-04 16:24:03 I'm from mobile rn.
creations-chat 2020-09-04 16:24:38 Something red.
creations-chat 2020-09-04 16:24:41 I had this trash.
creations-chat 2020-09-04 16:24:48 And never finished it.
creations-chat 2020-09-04 16:25:09 My freighter over the capital class ship.
creations-chat 2020-09-04 16:26:04 There is a freighter, wich is ironicaly, will be never finished too.
creations-chat 2020-09-04 16:26:05 Wasted like 4 hours on it.
creations-chat 2020-09-04 16:26:16 The black dot is a player character in scale.
creations-chat 2020-09-04 16:26:34 E
creations-chat 2020-09-04 16:26:41 Cat is here.
creations-chat 2020-09-04 16:26:50 Let's go for a walk.
creations-chat 2020-09-04 16:26:55 Into an airlock.
creations-chat 2020-09-04 16:27:45 Capital class hull took only 1 hour or so.
creations-chat 2020-09-04 16:28:12 
creations-chat 2020-09-04 16:28:59 Civil, this game has part volume limit.
creations-chat 2020-09-04 16:29:16 In what I bult those dum-dum gray ships.
creations-chat 2020-09-04 16:29:35 Wich means you can't stretch blocks infinetely.
creations-chat 2020-09-04 16:29:56 So one side of a hull took 20 huge parts.
creations-chat 2020-09-04 16:31:25 I also had Coriolis station. Scrapped it because the size and amount of parts/their volume broke down roblox physics.
creations-chat 2020-09-04 16:32:11 The joke is, it was intended to actually spin to produce gravity.
creations-chat 2020-09-04 16:32:28 But roblox said.
creations-chat 2020-09-04 16:32:41 "You're gay, go play Plane Crazy."
creations-chat 2020-09-04 16:32:58 And station can't rotate/spin.
creations-chat 2020-09-04 16:33:07 No matter how much gyros it has.
creations-chat 2020-09-04 16:35:15 Instead of goddamn station, colony and heavy planet cracker there is only asteroid field in wich I accidentaly ruined my Cobra.
creations-chat 2020-09-04 16:35:15 Lmao, I found the only one Space Engineers screenshot on my phone.
creations-chat 2020-09-04 16:36:27 Yeah, morale of the story is if you play with orbital mechanics - don't forget that asteroids don't obey physics.
creations-chat 2020-09-04 16:37:09 I tried to use gas giant as slingshot but struct asteroid field at speed of 4k meters per second.
creations-chat 2020-09-04 16:39:46 ~~Next time I will be from my lap, I could drop in some screenshots of my industial monsters.~~
creations-chat 2020-09-05 05:27:00 Royale high is a big gay.

creations-chat 2020-09-05 05:28:37 Buy him 10 fire ice nike shirts.
creations-chat 2020-09-05 05:29:10 Nothing surpricefull that you're being scammed.
creations-chat 2020-09-05 05:29:19 The scam is so oblivous.
creations-chat 2020-09-05 05:29:21 F12.
creations-chat 2020-09-05 05:29:57 Use F12.
creations-chat 2020-09-05 05:30:00 Just press it.
creations-chat 2020-09-05 05:30:10 It's a freaking roblox feature.
creations-chat 2020-09-05 05:30:20 Then edit video in any online video editor.
creations-chat 2020-09-05 05:30:29 And tha-da, you're awesome.
creations-chat 2020-09-05 05:32:46 British people be like.
creations-chat 2020-09-05 05:37:21 Lol.

creations-chat 2020-09-05 06:00:46 Ot vinta.
creations-chat 2020-09-06 04:41:11 Whenever someone types "It's for dislikes" I want to smash their poor PC.
creations-chat 2020-09-06 04:41:41 That bland reaction bait should be prohibited - what's the reason of posting something bad to get bad score?
creations-chat 2020-09-06 04:43:19 Then what's the reason of posting shit?
creations-chat 2020-09-06 04:44:11 If you want them being realisticaly judged - post them here. You gain nothing from collecting dislikes.
creations-chat 2020-09-06 04:45:46 The problem is that there are 10-20 morons who constantly drop in some trash and ask it to be downvoted.

"I need judging and cricitism" doesen't even work here because upvotes/downvotes don't show mistakes 'ere.
creations-chat 2020-09-06 04:46:06 It will one day make me dislike any build from those autors.
creations-chat 2020-09-06 04:46:14 Even if they are good.
creations-chat 2020-09-06 04:46:22 Just because of old muscular memory.
creations-chat 2020-09-06 04:46:33 Go on.
creations-chat 2020-09-06 04:47:23 This kind of people should get new plate with "Reactions removed" so there will be nothing for bait to.
creations-chat 2020-09-06 04:47:41 Bot will not place upvote/downvote under their posts.
creations-chat 2020-09-06 04:48:18 There is a rule disallowing baiting for upvotes.
creations-chat 2020-09-06 04:48:29 So there should be same but into another side.
creations-chat 2020-09-06 04:49:21 You know why it will get downvotes.
creations-chat 2020-09-06 04:49:24 Right now.
creations-chat 2020-09-06 04:50:16 > There should be a neutral button in between upvote and downvote so we can show those people that it's not that their post got ignored but we genuinely don't want to give them attention
It still gives them attention. And we are not stricted to always leave a mark.
creations-chat 2020-09-06 04:51:02 The bus is bruh btw.
creations-chat 2020-09-06 04:51:20 Low detail. I constantly see newbs build buses.
creations-chat 2020-09-06 04:52:49 > hmm now that you mention low detail..
It's literally a empty box made out ot 1x1and 1x7/1x4 blocks but with materials and paints. And also default wheels.
creations-chat 2020-09-06 04:53:12 Also I never liked how people try to defend builds with words "My first tho"
creations-chat 2020-09-06 04:53:48 ~~My first build was a cyberpunk-stylish VTOL.~~
creations-chat 2020-09-06 04:54:21 ~~140 hours in KSP and 89 in Space Engineers makes sense.~~
creations-chat 2020-09-06 04:54:50 Jokes on you.
creations-chat 2020-09-06 04:54:57 I said it without a joke.
creations-chat 2020-09-06 04:55:24 Just joined a game, messed up a bit with all the mechanisms to know their functions.
creations-chat 2020-09-06 04:55:29 And then was like.
creations-chat 2020-09-06 04:55:38 "It's a game about white planes??"
creations-chat 2020-09-06 04:56:19 And made a small VTOL with default colors from some helium, 6 engines and some other stuff.
creations-chat 2020-09-06 04:56:59 There is a build in a history - VD-11 wich was just an updated version of my first ever build.
creations-chat 2020-09-06 05:21:39 > i need weapon ideas

creations-chat 2020-09-06 05:25:34 Cutters are worthless as coilgun ammunition.
creations-chat 2020-09-06 05:25:47 Use explosive balls.
creations-chat 2020-09-06 05:26:04 It just bounces because of desync.
creations-chat 2020-09-06 05:26:42 And if target is slow enough TNT will bounce not that far away to get it into the damage range.
creations-chat 2020-09-06 05:26:56 And don't call coilguns a railguns. They're different.
creations-chat 2020-09-06 05:27:41 The first one is pure use of magnetic power on a rod/any non-powdered ammunition.
creations-chat 2020-09-06 05:28:18 ~~Your tank is a garbage dude. <:KEKW:670310537300672528>~~

creations-chat 2020-09-06 06:59:01 But they are realistic.
creations-chat 2020-09-06 06:59:27 I didn't seen star wrek ships to have nozzles to control rotation.
creations-chat 2020-09-06 06:59:46 And don't have weak spots like those thin "legs" on wich they connect engines.
creations-chat 2020-09-06 07:00:15 And why the heck all of their ships are literally wet dream of 80's nerd - a slim plate.

creations-chat 2020-09-06 07:04:52 Nah, that's one is better.
creations-chat 2020-09-06 07:05:07 <:what:644996672048463942>
creations-chat 2020-09-06 07:05:15 Star wars isn't a sci-fi dude.
creations-chat 2020-09-06 07:06:02 It's literally magic tale about good guys against bad guys, magic swords, bad range weapons, orchestra music and no proper space.
creations-chat 2020-09-06 07:06:52 It is like talking how something bad can be popular so this is good.

creations-chat 2020-09-06 07:11:23 Easy target to hit, to spot and call gay.
creations-chat 2020-09-06 07:11:33 Indeed it is.
creations-chat 2020-09-06 07:11:49 The one advantage of mecha is only ability to walk on some really rough surface.
creations-chat 2020-09-06 07:11:54 Like on ruins.
creations-chat 2020-09-06 07:12:04 Where tank can bump into a large rock.
creations-chat 2020-09-06 07:12:24 Btw Titanfall meches are pretty realistic tho.
creations-chat 2020-09-06 07:12:37 I love Titanfall.
creations-chat 2020-09-06 07:13:15 Meches IRL have only one advantage - they are multirole if they have manupulators.
creations-chat 2020-09-06 07:13:22 Basicaly take any gun.
creations-chat 2020-09-06 07:13:28 Or that part of a plane.
creations-chat 2020-09-06 07:13:32 And go bonk a tank.
creations-chat 2020-09-06 07:13:52 Or work as cargo loader in peacefull times.
creations-chat 2020-09-06 07:14:12 Tanks are not as flexible in roles as meches indeed.
creations-chat 2020-09-06 07:14:22 But the price is true tho.
creations-chat 2020-09-06 07:14:37 It looks like.
creations-chat 2020-09-06 07:14:45 One of Evangelion guides.

creations-chat 2020-09-06 07:16:22 The joke about meches.
creations-chat 2020-09-06 07:16:33 Is that they win in Battlefield 2142.
creations-chat 2020-09-06 07:16:35 <:KEKW:670310537300672528>

creations-chat 2020-09-06 07:17:46 <:what:644996672048463942>
creations-chat 2020-09-06 07:18:07 Actually I think meches are good for combat in a city scenario.
creations-chat 2020-09-06 07:18:28 Because they mostly ignore human arms exept explosives.
creations-chat 2020-09-06 07:18:44 And they can shoot out of the wall just like humans do.
creations-chat 2020-09-06 07:18:56 And you can't get advantage over them by hiding on a roof.
creations-chat 2020-09-06 07:19:09 Ye.
creations-chat 2020-09-06 07:19:35 *But in a war who cares when you can afford building meches?*

creations-chat 2020-09-06 07:30:30 Building cranes could lift a plane or two.

creations-chat 2020-09-12 17:23:06 Someone should make Farragut.
creations-chat 2020-09-12 17:23:13 Or it will be me.
creations-chat 2020-09-12 17:25:21 Distantly form reminds me stylish sci-fi ship.

creations-chat 2020-09-13 09:13:26 Hey my fellow carrier/helicopter/armyofsimilarplane-lovers, here is some nasty things about suspension you could try to recreate.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrQrJ57J9eE
creations-chat 2020-09-17 03:56:29 <:what:644996672048463942>
creations-chat 2020-09-17 03:56:45 I don't have pick of my first ship anymore.
creations-chat 2020-09-17 03:56:49 <:what:644996672048463942>
creations-chat 2020-09-17 03:56:56 And I'm glad.
creations-chat 2020-09-17 03:57:53 I remember how I removed my first ground vehicle. Rest in lasagna M-23 Mako.
creations-chat 2020-09-17 03:58:12 Never forget. He was actually good in PVP and terrain shit.
creations-chat 2020-09-17 03:58:35 *Never built a tutorial plane.*
creations-chat 2020-09-17 03:58:41 *Even for memes.*
creations-chat 2020-09-17 03:59:08 I just didn't got a tutorial at start.
creations-chat 2020-09-17 03:59:19 I am about it.
creations-chat 2020-09-17 03:59:43 I could one day build a starter plane.
creations-chat 2020-09-17 03:59:59 Does it have fuel blocks?
creations-chat 2020-09-17 04:00:31 I just seen randomly one big tutorial plane somewhere.
creations-chat 2020-09-17 04:00:49 Super rockets?
creations-chat 2020-09-17 04:00:59 <:what:644996672048463942>
creations-chat 2020-09-17 04:01:24 I used super rockets only on frigate to make it controlable without air friction.
creations-chat 2020-09-17 04:01:50 All the builds wich fly have only hover engines.
creations-chat 2020-09-17 04:02:11 Because FeEL tEh SPEEd
creations-chat 2020-09-17 04:02:21 And at the same time speed is controlable.
creations-chat 2020-09-17 04:03:11 Daym, I remember how I wasted 30 minutes on Space Engineers to build a hovertank.
creations-chat 2020-09-17 04:03:20 And then crash it.
creations-chat 2020-09-17 04:03:41 And then wasted another 50 minutes of refining and mining for new resources.
creations-chat 2020-09-17 04:04:16 The problem was in that SE don't have any stuff to make hover vehicles on default.
creations-chat 2020-09-17 04:04:36 No mods.
creations-chat 2020-09-17 04:04:44 No scripts.
creations-chat 2020-09-17 04:05:26 Before script stuff I manually controlled my minig rover wich had tower on top with 2 drills.
creations-chat 2020-09-17 04:05:47 4 pistons in each group, controlled rotation speed with sliders.
creations-chat 2020-09-17 04:06:11 Basicaly no script turret play is a pain.
creations-chat 2020-09-17 04:06:45 S m o r t.
creations-chat 2020-09-17 04:07:14 Do you play with Orbiter mechanics mod?
creations-chat 2020-09-17 04:07:25 P a t h e t i c.
creations-chat 2020-09-17 04:07:40 *laughs in 274 hours in pirated KSP.*
creations-chat 2020-09-17 04:08:08 Do you use gravity generators with more than 0.2G set on them?
creations-chat 2020-09-17 04:08:23 P a t h e t i c u s.
creations-chat 2020-09-17 04:08:53 Funk gravity generators. All my bros hate gravity generators.
creations-chat 2020-09-17 04:09:34 From ME?
creations-chat 2020-09-17 04:09:37 Nah.
creations-chat 2020-09-17 04:09:50 It works only on one custom planet.
creations-chat 2020-09-17 04:10:18 >New update to SE wich will be not DLC for items.
creations-chat 2020-09-17 04:10:21 <:KEKW:670310537300672528>
creations-chat 2020-09-17 04:10:49 Latest update was basicaly an advertise of DLC.
creations-chat 2020-09-17 04:11:25 Btw.
creations-chat 2020-09-17 04:11:34 Try to play a survival with Orbiter.
creations-chat 2020-09-17 04:11:47 Breh.
creations-chat 2020-09-17 04:12:05 Said that you suck at spider raids.
creations-chat 2020-09-17 04:12:28 When they can't destroy blocks anymore.
creations-chat 2020-09-17 04:13:23 Sabroids are pathetic. And devs daying that their game is used to simulate AI are freaking comedians.
creations-chat 2020-09-17 04:13:26 <:KEKW:670310537300672528>
creations-chat 2020-09-17 04:13:52 My latest grid btw was a station around one gas giant from mod.
creations-chat 2020-09-17 04:14:00 Not static, fully dynamic.
creations-chat 2020-09-17 04:14:22 It was on orbit.
creations-chat 2020-09-17 04:14:32 This is why I love Orbiter mechanics mod.
creations-chat 2020-09-17 04:14:44 Yes.
creations-chat 2020-09-17 04:14:57 Basicaly all the bodies have gravity fields more than 100 km.
creations-chat 2020-09-17 04:15:09 You can use them to slingshot yourself.
creations-chat 2020-09-17 04:15:14 Be on a stable orbit.
creations-chat 2020-09-17 04:15:17 Etc.
creations-chat 2020-09-17 04:15:29 Btw, use it with speed limit increased.
creations-chat 2020-09-17 04:15:32 I use 8k.
creations-chat 2020-09-17 04:15:52 And don't use it with systems wich have black holes from mods.
creations-chat 2020-09-17 04:16:20 Because they mess up with orbiter so hard, that basicaly their gravity field will be all over the system.
creations-chat 2020-09-17 04:16:37 And it will instantly sling you at max speed thorward them.
creations-chat 2020-09-17 04:16:47 Btw.
creations-chat 2020-09-17 04:17:01 My station looked like freaking Endurance from Interstellar.
creations-chat 2020-09-17 04:17:16 Because I only use spin to produce gravity.
creations-chat 2020-09-17 04:17:30 Yes, it works everywhere.
creations-chat 2020-09-17 04:17:44 As long as you have collisions.
creations-chat 2020-09-17 04:17:52 And as long it has zero G.
creations-chat 2020-09-17 04:18:15 You can search up my builds in Creations channel. I showed how it works in PC too.
creations-chat 2020-09-17 04:18:46 Yes. A video.
creations-chat 2020-09-17 04:18:56 Where I ride a car inside of a ring.
creations-chat 2020-09-17 04:19:03 Btw.
creations-chat 2020-09-17 04:19:09 I use gravity generators.
creations-chat 2020-09-17 04:19:33 Because without them you will land on surface, but game won't recongnize it as walkable surface.
creations-chat 2020-09-17 04:20:07 And at max you will use magboots, but after jump you will not rotate with the station and fall on your face.
creations-chat 2020-09-17 04:20:19 Grav gens are used only at very low.
creations-chat 2020-09-17 04:20:34 To align character to the surface under him.
creations-chat 2020-09-17 04:20:45 And to disable mag boots.
creations-chat 2020-09-17 04:20:51 SE?
creations-chat 2020-09-17 04:21:03 I played it when it had no planets.
creations-chat 2020-09-17 04:21:14 Yeah.
creations-chat 2020-09-17 04:21:24 I recently joined with mods.
creations-chat 2020-09-17 04:21:45 And use all my skills of engineering education in hardcore survival.
creations-chat 2020-09-17 04:22:20 Btw, no programmable blocks to filter stuff in conveyer system.
creations-chat 2020-09-17 04:22:33 Sorter part is for chad.
creations-chat 2020-09-17 04:23:03 I can find one of my early game screenshots.
creations-chat 2020-09-17 04:23:11 Of an desert base near crash site.
creations-chat 2020-09-17 04:34:06 So beautifull that I picked my eyes out to never see something more disgusting.
creations-chat 2020-09-17 04:37:05 Imagine someone making a plane with a coilgun and autoloader.
creations-chat 2020-09-17 04:37:23 Just like italians made a plane with hovitzer.
bug-reports 2020-09-17 07:06:53 ~~*Did I heard "trap"?*~~
creations-chat 2020-09-17 07:07:49 Shipwright is easiest to get I think.
creations-chat 2020-09-17 07:08:30 The hardest is VTOL if you have principle of not using tons of fucking super engines.
creations-chat 2020-09-17 07:10:24 ~~But I still laugh how I got terrain specialist with a fortress from Red vs Blue.~~
creations-chat 2020-09-17 07:13:34 I mean yeah, rocket is just attached rocket engines. But there is no proper buyancy physics.
creations-chat 2020-09-17 07:13:44 So it is not hard to make simple ship.
creations-chat 2020-09-22 10:48:06 I am building something. Guess what.
creations-chat 2020-09-22 10:49:45 Motorlock only for those pathetic pewple who can't find a way to use default wedges to make thing go cool. haha pow.
creations-chat 2020-09-22 11:17:18 A bigger spoiler.
creations-chat 2020-09-22 11:17:33 Guess that thing.
creations-chat 2020-09-22 11:19:16 Wot.
creations-chat 2020-09-22 12:06:45 Some moar progress at thing no one recognizes.
creations-chat 2020-09-22 12:07:14 N o.
creations-chat 2020-09-22 12:07:35 Bruh.

creations-chat 2020-09-22 12:58:46 <:kek:652566605028524033>
creations-chat 2020-09-22 12:59:05 Meanwhile some moar progress.
creations-chat 2020-09-22 13:00:45 It is based on Systems Alliance ships.
creations-chat 2020-09-22 13:00:49 Mass Effect.
creations-chat 2020-09-22 13:02:50 Basicaly no way to recognize that - 80% of community only heard about ME at max.
creations-chat 2020-09-22 13:40:13 Some more update on finished "wing" parts.
creations-chat 2020-09-22 13:59:35 Hull is complete.
creations-chat 2020-09-22 14:00:45 Any suggestions where I should install gun placement on it?
creations-chat 2020-09-22 14:02:09 How about putting some under armor plates?
creations-chat 2020-09-22 14:07:52 I am thinking to place them here.
creations-chat 2020-09-22 14:08:02 Because basicaly we will never fight other ships on it.
creations-chat 2020-09-22 14:08:19 And planes are insanely hard to hit via turrets.
creations-chat 2020-09-22 14:08:23 So only ground targets.
creations-chat 2020-09-22 14:31:56 People, do I need to paint my frigate in Systems Alliance colors or Cerberus like my UT-47?
creations-chat 2020-09-23 01:11:00 When unfolding goes wrong.
creations-chat 2020-09-23 01:11:11 
creations-chat 2020-09-23 01:18:52 Is that a shitpost hole?
creations-chat 2020-09-23 01:24:20 Atleast now we can fly.
creations-chat 2020-09-23 02:36:40 
creations-chat 2020-09-23 03:16:30 Started making a Cerberus warpaint.
creations-chat 2020-09-23 03:18:08 I'm guessing, can I finally get 60 upvotes?
creations-chat 2020-09-23 03:18:16 Ofc when I finish it.
creations-chat 2020-10-01 16:51:09 Amount of cringe I'm getting from creations chat is slowly increasing. <:what:644996672048463942>
creations-chat 2020-10-01 16:53:21 Why do we need those worthless tank images?<:what:644996672048463942>
creations-chat 2020-10-01 16:53:48 <:what:644996672048463942>

creations-chat 2020-10-01 16:56:48 Well, I'd better avoid that cult of red tank.
creations-chat 2020-10-05 15:06:39 🤔
creations-chat 2020-10-07 05:16:14 Checked the channel after 3 weeks of idling. People keep building ships, tanks and modern planes. <:what:644996672048463942>
creations-chat 2020-10-07 05:16:42 The only thing I liked is paragliders and Ion from TF2 because the size. Hope it can walk.
creations-chat 2020-10-08 08:09:23 Meanwhile I'll drop in my Cobra Mk2.5 from Starbound. Just because yes.
creations-chat 2020-10-08 10:28:42 Apcank. <:what:644996672048463942>
creations-chat 2020-10-25 11:40:11 I remember my old Cobra Mk3 here, wich was big one.
creations-chat 2020-10-25 11:41:20 So I built a new one in Minecraft, lol.
creations-chat 2020-11-17 08:11:19 Plane Crazy in a nutshell.
creations-chat 2020-11-17 08:31:38 Ah yes, Plane Crazy as it is.
creations-chat 2020-11-17 12:39:49 So anyways, I came from a long break and after roblox memory limit update I finally can build new stuff without deleting old one. Magnificent.
creations-chat 2020-11-17 12:41:19 Guess what is that.
creations-chat 2020-11-17 12:47:18 Wrong x3.
creations-chat 2020-11-17 12:48:51 Wrong x4. Happy to see you again dude.
creations-chat 2020-11-17 12:51:07 And the right answer was given by Defen. It's a blimp. Big broen Class.
creations-chat 2020-11-17 14:04:28 *I have serve feeling that I will have not enough space for full build even with folding...* Anyways, frontal part is done at 30%

creations-chat 2020-11-18 04:11:41 I never used mouse to control planes. It just feels weird.
creations-chat 2020-11-18 04:23:13 I hate mouse control. All my homies hate mouse control!
creations-chat 2020-11-18 08:50:49 Almost finished my kid.
creations-chat 2020-11-18 08:54:52 Airships*
Blimps and zeppelins are separate types of an airship class.
creations-chat 2020-11-18 14:08:31 > <@!291956715749113868> Ad Victoriam to your beautiful Airship, that thing deserves to be in the hall of fame
<@!388665606968442880>, Ad Victoram comrade. Imo Fallout 4 main story and war is total crap. Factions could live together.
creations-chat 2020-11-18 14:10:39 It is more of a little brother of Prydwen.
creations-chat 2020-11-18 14:14:48 Yep, first gold rank.
creations-chat 2020-11-18 15:41:25 So apparently I can land my airship on water and it stays perfectly.
creations-chat 2020-11-18 15:43:06 Also I finished upper part with helium tanks. Made it simple.
creations-chat 2020-11-18 15:44:49 I think most planes and tanks already were made in tutors in multiple variations.
creations-chat 2020-11-18 15:46:36 This is why I don't like those "I made new tank!"
creations-chat 2020-11-18 18:14:58 A tip - used disconnector plates and text plates can work as flat stone surface. Additionaly use half blocks for even more small objects.
creations-chat 2020-11-18 18:20:18 Disconnector plates can be good if you make crates - just make it bit darker and it can look like crate's cap.
creations-chat 2020-11-18 18:21:50 Kinda. But bushes and other flora looks to blocky and monocoloric. Use slight gradient with changing colors from like 90 90 90 to 85 85 85 - it makes good way of fake shadows and depth.
creations-chat 2020-11-18 18:32:00 Btw just use anchor for rotating camera, Imao. Or make full green screen room for additional photoshop godpowers.
creations-chat 2020-11-18 18:47:24 Kinda funny that my blimp got like 100 upvotes, yet my older builds like UNSC frigate were struggling to take 50.
creations-chat 2020-11-18 18:49:36 Probably you're right. Each time I load it to add more details or crash someone's potato-PC, half of the server is trying to ram it/land on it, jump under it, climb on it, etc.
creations-chat 2020-11-18 18:51:33 And that oversaturation with planes, cars and tanks does it's job of keeping people intrigued on something new/forgotten.

Btw, suprisingly my mini-Prydwen is strong at survival under fire.
creations-chat 2020-11-18 18:55:37 I use helium tanks under outer hull with gap of 2 blocks, additionaly with supporting struts. Missles can't get them, guns don't penetrate them if not stacked.

The only problem is perfect weight balance being disturbed with each non-helium block being destroyed. Blimp just starts ascending to the God faster and faster.

creations-chat 2020-11-19 04:46:23 Should I bring back cursed Warhog times?
creations-chat 2020-11-19 04:48:54 One dude made it, but I will make it too, probably rebuild tallhog and chadhog again. Damn, I had a good collection of cursed Hogs wich I deleted to build a goddamn Type-8.
creations-chat 2020-11-19 05:06:15 It is so raw that all hydrogen turns back to water.
creations-chat 2020-11-19 05:15:29 Imagine devs actually post news and add builds connection with magnets. I would make actual docking claws for my blimp...
creations-chat 2020-11-19 06:45:39 > It's kinda sad.. it isn't really possible to build massive scale airships in hame.. because they are fucking huge.. and unlike a ship where you can cut off half of it.. you see all of the airship..
<@!407347404858458123>, use BYSS. They have roblox FX3 building mechanic, but no advanced physics simulation.
creations-chat 2020-11-19 08:26:25 An update? Also I didn't showed internals at all. Only exterior before. And also fixed some asymmetrical paint.
creations-chat 2020-11-19 08:29:03 in any case I didn't showed it at all exept for some small parts wich were shown from outside.
creations-chat 2020-11-19 08:42:00 It is an post-apocalypse. Fallout-inspired.
creations-chat 2020-11-19 08:52:37 No matter how hard I try to bypass roblox censoring algorytm, I can't write blimp's name. Cring.
creations-chat 2020-11-19 09:09:21 Anchors are cool and all, but it's impossible to properly spread them from airship for stable placement.
creations-chat 2020-11-19 09:24:02 I talked about my anchors.
creations-chat 2020-11-19 09:37:02 Tower looks hot. Ngl.
creations-chat 2020-11-19 09:39:06 Never was a fan of airships, but actually I think I know why people like them. Having an ability to casually walk on open air on the heigh higher than you can get with a building.
creations-chat 2020-11-19 09:44:36 Anyways, I am going on expedition how far I can go from spawn point.
creations-chat 2020-11-19 09:46:42 This sacrifice of time is going to be made for Institute and us all. Or atleast our curiosity.
creations-chat 2020-11-19 10:15:55 So apparently my roblox crashed for no reason when I walked away. Starting it all again...

creations-chat 2020-11-20 15:16:22 <:KEKW:670310537300672528>
creations-chat 2020-11-20 15:27:00 As you see - already yes. As I also took inspiration from Cowboy Bebop, it can land on water and ride on it.
creations-chat 2020-11-20 15:30:47 As I also took inspiration from Cowboy Bebop, it can land on water and glide on it's surface. Color palette will be in style of Journey's characters.
creations-chat 2020-11-20 15:38:25 Eww, a mouse control.

creations-chat 2020-11-20 16:10:59 Eww, a motorlock users... <:what:644996672048463942>
creations-chat 2020-11-20 16:13:15 I just don't like motorlocks and other kinds of those tricks wich do fuck with physical engine. It's like in what will turn real life combat if you can just grab a table under you, pull on yourself to fly. Weird for my feeling of realism.
creations-chat 2020-11-20 16:18:32 Each time I join PvP I just meet some planes flying at speed faster than bullet tracer and missle wich turns combat in completely unplayable mess.
creations-chat 2020-11-20 16:20:15 Ah yes, plane crazy in a nutshell.
creations-chat 2020-11-20 17:10:00 *Yes but actually no.*
creations-chat 2020-11-20 17:12:23 I tried to keep it lagless as I can for another planned expedition to roblox farlands.

creations-chat 2020-11-20 19:31:48 To my luck it is safe to walk on it with that speed.
creations-chat 2020-11-20 19:33:24 Btw, is there a way to fix lights turning off?
creations-chat 2020-11-20 19:34:58 Yes it is. My lights pereodicaly turn themselves off. Had to constantly press button when they do it.
creations-chat 2020-11-21 04:29:41 I like how I just went sleepin' and whole <#384025409945337856> went on downvote combo full of weird stuff. Oh god, I miss so much things in my life. <:what:644996672048463942>
creations-chat 2020-11-21 04:32:42 There is no airports with direct connection to the port area as they're completely separate structual buildings. In structual I mean that chain of command, staff and etc just can't work together no matter hard you try to make one to replace another.
creations-chat 2020-11-21 04:34:18 PvP bote full of super engines? Pathetic.

Actually it just need some color variationing.
creations-chat 2020-11-21 05:42:59 Imagine someone actually building good non-fictional stuff... Damn, I miss ol' days (never) when people were not building same planes with motorlocks...
creations-chat 2020-11-21 12:12:05 Not intended, but still a feature. Secret NOD technologies of turning a tank into a pole.
creations-chat 2020-11-21 14:39:04 Any ideas how to make it stable? It just randomly trips, steers directly upwards and stays like that.

creations-chat 2020-11-21 18:22:15 So it flies.
creations-chat 2020-11-21 18:47:11 This is how you should land™️
creations-chat 2020-11-21 18:50:44 It should but actually no. Because in PC physics for some reason this aerodynamical form constantly being stalled down by the engine part and plane tries to look up. I wasted 3 hours, used multiple motorlocks to beat this thing and was succesed only partialy. It still loses lots of speed on each turn, but it is flyable.
creations-chat 2020-11-21 18:53:04 Haha go brrr.

creations-chat 2020-11-22 06:42:26 Now it looks like this. Still proud that made it in robloxian scale and flyable (because fuck you physics, this kind of vehicle can't fly in atmosphere properly.

creations-chat 2020-12-27 02:31:33 Gravity slider is a must for realistic spaceship build. Basicaly they won't fly in PC physics without shitton of engines everywhere.

creations-chat 2020-12-27 02:34:37 Helium is bruh and unepic + easy to make ship destabilized after being hit.
Shitton of engines is constant head ache from sounds and shitton of unnecesary effects. And they take up space you could use for internals of the ship.
creations-chat 2020-12-27 02:39:09 Helium :
A) Causes minor physical throttling
B) If perfectly balanced, will make ship go up/down if one or more blocks are being destroyed.
C) Can't use materials.
D) I don't see spaceships to use helium IRL or in sci-fi.
E) It don't allow to simulate real spess physics and don't allow do kensei dorifto with your ISD.

My Leodegrance tries to ascend to the higher realm if someone is trying to shoot the hull (due helium being hidden as tanks under it).
creations-chat 2020-12-27 02:46:53 I think you don't get how I placed helium. Main body is the empty hull, under it is a whole compartment with separated by 2 blocks empty space helium tanks. They lift up while being protecc.
creations-chat 2020-12-27 02:51:22 It's called "perfect balance" design where your build don't move up nor move down with outer force (engines or push). And outer hull while protecting tanks from damage, balances the airship from lifting up.
Damaged outer hull causes airtanks to lift up faster.
IRL this problem is fixed by releasing some helium up to keep balance, but we are in Plane Crazy which has less features than cardboard box.

creations-chat 2021-03-22 14:03:33 Nah. I wanted to add conveyer based FSD, but tests show that physical throttling is to major to gain any effect.
creations-chat 2021-03-22 14:21:54 My evolution of Elite shipbuilding was cringeous on start too.
creations-chat 2021-03-22 14:25:08 Btw, if someone interested how I load up SRV into ship.

creations-chat 2021-05-04 11:16:07 U h. You'll see...
bug-reports 2021-05-31 23:41:12 Bug: For a year or so I still see problem with explosives exploding after bouncing instead on-contact just like missiles does. Also cutters does no damage after getting high speed. Even if you clip into enemy.

This renders highly accelerated projectiles completely useless in PvP. For god sake, make them explode instantly without any ticklag in process. Years have passed, microupdates were introduced, but no fix for such basic problem...
bug-reports 2021-05-31 23:45:16 Also bug: Long parts like 1x4 type wedges, 1x7 bulks still do not want to be placed by their sides - instead of trying to be placed and connected in free placement on building plots, they render their attachment to cursor and noclip in most cases inside of blocks.
bug-reports 2021-05-31 23:49:52 Like build is directed forward by the arrow on the plot, you can't place 1x4 wedge by it's flat 1x1 side aimed to edge of baseplate.
bug-reports 2021-06-01 03:03:10 Why it is impossible? Imo just would be easier to make blocks to use dynamic attachment to cursor - basically block schematics follow cursor by one side, but if there is surface on which cursor aimed at, block schematics will relocate to part that can be connected instead of trying to follow old mouse placement.
creations-chat 2021-06-01 03:09:04 Do anyone have an idea how to make working explosive ball coilgun that will actually destroy targets instead of bouncing with each shot from them? I want one at the bottom of warship. <:Yikes:704804144657203220>

creations-chat 2021-06-01 21:02:46 It's simple - pride propaganda is everywhere and people's eyes are burning. Reflexes tell them to downvote anything rn and I support it.

creations-chat 2021-09-07 06:52:56 First M44 wasn't that popular neither.
bug-reports 2021-09-07 18:08:04 I have issue with missile launchers - they work fine while I stay still, but as long as I move, they launch with considerable delay after press. Under that I mean after press they disappear from pylons, but don't materealize as projectiles. After 4-5 seconds they will actually spawn and fly forward in *random* placement where I flew/rid before.
bug-reports 2021-09-07 18:08:37 Same shit for firework launchers - I can't fire them on the go without having them spawn randomly over the map.
bug-reports 2021-09-07 18:10:34 I have this issue after whole month. Multiple lap-lap restarts did nothing. And multiple different hotspots.
bug-reports 2021-09-07 18:12:39 Prob. Did reinstalled - didn't much helped.
bug-reports 2021-09-07 18:13:11 Captain Obvious.
bug-reports 2021-09-07 18:15:49 That's the issue - I have no handy weapon in PvP against anything somewhat fast like cutters. Guns don't do shit.
