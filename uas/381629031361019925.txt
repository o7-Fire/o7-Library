creations-chat 2019-10-24 02:18:51 it uses helium as its only lifting force and ballast for balance. the only form of forward thrust is the two props on the side. it has two smaller ones on either side to help it maneuver into ports. The massive tail is on a motor and is its primary steering device. the pontunes on the bottom help it float with little resistance and also acts as its landing gear on land.
