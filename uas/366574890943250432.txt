creations-chat 2021-04-24 14:48:43 so what you are saying is that i dont know anything about any plane bc i dont know what the god fucking damn color of an afterburner is on a plane that was classified and 'guarded" by someones grandpa just because you can make an sr71 in pc doesnt mean you are smarter than absolutely everyone else in pcc


imma take a guess that you just googled that pos lmao imma put this on r/iamverybadass
creations-chat 2021-04-24 14:53:44 yeah because we dont believe your grandpa guarded such a plane and if he did do such thing we wouldnt give a shit
