help 2019-09-20 21:22:26 Where do I request it? In the creations-chat?
help 2019-09-20 21:22:46 I was just making sure so I don't ask in the wrong channel.
creations-chat 2019-09-20 21:25:09 <@310863132727836672> What are you using to move that top part onto the lower part?
creations-chat 2019-09-20 21:25:29 I was just curious. Thanks.
creations-chat 2019-09-20 21:26:47 I think there are a few people that just go to <#384025409945337856> and just downvote everything they see.
creations-chat 2019-09-20 21:27:36 I keep seing Zebra and peppi in the downvotes.

creations-chat 2019-09-20 21:30:53 <@310863132727836672> Username?
creations-chat 2019-09-20 21:31:05 oh wait
creations-chat 2019-09-20 21:31:28 I didn't know, because my discord username isn't set to my ROBLOX username.
creations-chat 2019-09-20 21:31:40 Which is odd.
help 2019-09-22 18:37:02 I'd like some help. I am making a rocket that is *way* too big for the barrier I am given. So, what I am *trying* to do is rotate other areas of the rocket into place, bypassing the height barrier. I would love to keep the motors hidden. Any advice?  I simply can't find a way to hide the motors and make the motors rotate the other parts of the rocket. Is there any other ways to rotate the pieces into place?
help 2019-09-22 18:49:32 Darn.
