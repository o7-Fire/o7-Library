bug-reports 2021-06-22 12:13:23 alr here's a massive bug everybody experiences, motor storms, it'd be nice if they were fixed, they happen mostly with motor 1 if you use it for wheels and send your creation to brazil and tear the motors apart. locking the motors has some effect on prevention but if you're not careful they'll still get blown up
bug-reports 2021-06-22 12:13:44 also happens with motor 2 sometime but i don't know the conditions that lead to it

bug-reports 2021-07-16 19:19:43 very  known  bug  also  why  do  you  double  space  everything
bug-reports 2021-07-16 19:26:34 sometimes when you dislike something in <#384025409945337856>  you didn't make it go back to you not disliking it pls fix
creations-chat 2021-07-19 12:57:25 ayo guys what do you think of my P-51D i just posted in <#384025409945337856>
creations-chat 2021-07-19 13:05:04 m8 the camera lock welds to the seat and i can't bring the seat up a half a block to optimum positioning
creations-chat 2021-07-19 13:08:07 yeah ik but still, i think the dihedral takes the disadvantage away
creations-chat 2021-07-19 13:10:41 tbh the guns are just for added detail, but the top speed of 525 combined with pretty good stability make it a decent ground attack plane, it also has a firework in each drop tank for welding purposes and ground attack purposes because the guns aren't effective at all for ground attack
creations-chat 2021-07-19 13:22:03 it's very hard to get right, camera lock, and even on my mustang, only 2 cameras are used for lock purposes
creations-chat 2021-07-19 13:24:53 i went straight into camera lock before even trying angle locking because i don't wanna deal with that mess each time i spawn, i'd just prefer to deal with it whenever i load it, not every time i spawn, and that's not a problem, i can teach you how to camera lock if you want
creations-chat 2021-07-19 13:31:14 i really prefer to avoid angle locking, as it always means your build is just slightly different each time you spawn, and if you use tnt to delay the locking, it only works in VIP or pvp servers, so i don't find it too practical, and it also means you gotta angle everything each time you spawn, and in pvp, this is heaven for spawn campers, who see a spawned in build and move in for the kill, and camera lock can be used on the largest of builds if you take into mind welding
creations-chat 2021-07-19 13:34:13 angle lock also takes up valuable keybinds away from stuff like speakers, flight controls, and weapons, as well as causing issues of exposed lock often, which is why i prefer cameras which you can set and forget when you load the build, taking into mind welding
creations-chat 2021-07-19 13:36:59 alr ima start work on an F7F-3 day fighter, cy'all
creations-chat 2021-07-19 15:30:29 imagine the creations having 10 second cooldown but the creations feedback having 2 min cooldown lol
creations-chat 2021-07-19 15:37:40 i was asking for '50s rock not '50s pop, know any IDs i can use? <@456226577798135808> thank you i forgot smol winglets e
creations-chat 2021-07-19 15:42:03 not ejected it was designed with folding wings and a retracting hook in the nose so it could fit in the bomb bay of a B-36, which could carry 1 fighter and some bombs or 2 fighters and no bombs, while other planes had just bombs, but the test flights failed, pilots only managing to hook onto the motherplane 3 times throughout the test program, and only on the B-29s because testing, i'll look into the wedge nose
creations-chat 2021-07-19 15:44:17 that'll do for me bc rockn' roll was a '50s thing, elvis will do
creations-chat 2021-07-19 16:10:28 <@!738702049113538600> it don't work, guys can you find '50s rock and roll for my goblin?
creations-chat 2021-07-19 16:21:04 how did something with that much exposed motor lock get so far lol
creations-chat 2021-08-12 19:18:07 what should i change to my M4A1 turret?

creations-chat 2021-08-16 14:58:24 <@!697893501274161325> , 99eryaydude was right and i had a super hard time trying to round that out and just gave up for that part
creations-chat 2021-08-16 18:04:37 <@!356853573197496331> i motor locked half cylinder 2 into the corners and angle locked the back similarly, so yeah no wonder <@!571265344015171594>  you can't find them, but you can try to make them using motor lock, if you want i'll mention you in <#384025409945337856> to show you what i did
creations-chat 2021-08-16 18:06:51 <@!168586098895749120>  exposed motor lock the community gonna downvote hard btw, and it don't matter how much as long as it's not covered up, you're gonna get yelled at by somebody for it, might as well tell you now
creations-chat 2021-08-16 18:09:20 also how come nobody wonders how i did the super pog tracks on my sherman, i took a lot of pride in my unique tread design. . . . .

bug-reports 2021-08-23 12:26:03 sorry for the bad quality but this is what i could do
bug-reports 2021-08-23 12:26:10 please fix it
bug-reports 2021-08-23 12:26:43 ik hardly anybody uses camera lock but it is a very useful tool and no longer works. .  .
bug-reports 2021-08-23 12:27:51 <@!217336009455566848> , sorry for ping, please don't ban e but i need you to see this. .  .
bug-reports 2021-08-23 13:00:15 alright thank you rick
bug-reports 2021-08-23 15:41:58 ay rick, for a camera locked build, there are a few things you must know
bug-reports 2021-08-23 15:42:13 first of all, to make camera lock
bug-reports 2021-08-23 15:42:22 use config tool and click camera
bug-reports 2021-08-23 15:42:27 then click block
bug-reports 2021-08-23 15:42:36 the block is where camera will face
bug-reports 2021-08-23 15:42:52 you want the front of the camera to have what you want to be angled on
bug-reports 2021-08-23 15:45:32 also, once you lock a camera, it welds to the seat no matter what
bug-reports 2021-08-23 15:46:32 but i can't do too much from just trying to explain how it works
bug-reports 2021-08-23 15:46:39 camera lock is a very complicated thing
bug-reports 2021-08-23 15:50:13 also when you wanna rotate only what's on a camera, put another camera on the side you dont want to rotate otherwise it causes problems, weld everything else onto the camera that you used to prevent broken build
bug-reports 2021-08-23 15:50:19 gl on fixing it
bug-reports 2021-08-23 15:50:34 and if you do, please make the seat welding toggleable
bug-reports 2021-08-23 15:50:40 it's a hassle sometimes
bug-reports 2021-08-24 12:40:48 <@!403843930543882241> yes actually i built that mustang about three months ago and it worked great, but it doesn't even angle anymore
