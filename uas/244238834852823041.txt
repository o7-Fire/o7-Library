bug-reports 2019-04-11 05:14:40 Would be nice if when you shot someone's wing off it actually is cut lose, not just a chunk that is invisible for you and not the enemy pilot
bug-reports 2019-04-11 05:15:13 Sometimes you get to "shoot the whole plane off" and the pilot would just zoom around in his seat
bug-reports 2019-04-11 05:15:30 As if the whole plane was there intact

creations-chat 2020-03-08 19:35:44 Like when you make a high detail giant build but a single prop plane could outrun it at 200sps
creations-chat 2020-03-08 19:36:13 When the giant build reads like 500
creations-chat 2020-03-08 19:36:20 Because of lag
creations-chat 2020-03-10 16:01:08 Never realized having more parts is a good thing
creations-chat 2020-03-12 18:25:43 You can make anything fly in plane crazy if it has a single 1x1 wing panel and enough thrust

creations-chat 2020-10-19 16:40:19 people downvote for many things so a downvote or 2 is unavoidable

creations-chat 2020-10-22 16:56:31 <@!730808827234091041> a lot of people might like something like that but i think too much is going on in that engine
creations-chat 2020-10-22 16:58:01 clutter
creations-chat 2020-10-22 19:06:17 as cool as this thing looks i fucking hate it bc it cant do well in pvp. whole reason for building it was to replace my mig 21 :/
creations-chat 2020-10-22 19:07:21 the problem is lag; it turns well, goes 1000, no wobble
creations-chat 2020-10-22 19:08:43 armor isnt the problem

creations-chat 2020-10-24 05:27:26 why trap doors and disconnectors?
creations-chat 2020-10-24 21:39:34 shredder bugs dont exploit any glitches to do their purpose. they are legal. if anything my hover thruster jets are more illegal than any shredder bug out there lmao
creations-chat 2020-10-27 05:43:14 after realising motor locks are gonna always be slightly uneven i have used camera angling instead
creations-chat 2020-10-27 05:44:15 its really restricting on where you can place it tho, im pretty sure they break the creations if its on a motor lock
creations-chat 2020-10-27 05:46:48 yeah they kinda wacky, almost had to restructure my whole plane once
creations-chat 2020-10-27 05:48:11 perhaps but i bet it all just depends on where your pilot seat is
creations-chat 2020-10-27 05:52:01 on the a10?
creations-chat 2020-10-27 05:56:05 
creations-chat 2020-10-29 16:00:10 that splitter is ugly
creations-chat 2020-10-29 16:13:13 maybe half compress wing panels
creations-chat 2020-10-29 16:14:14 it makes it have a bit more drag but there wasnt much space to go fast with a car that big anyway
creations-chat 2020-10-29 16:16:39 i think thats a cool nose
creations-chat 2020-10-29 16:17:47 if you want it to look more aggressive make it longer,but i think its fine as is
creations-chat 2020-10-29 16:18:48 bulky
creations-chat 2020-10-29 16:19:49 the nose looks more generic now imo
creations-chat 2020-10-29 16:53:24 pretty sure half the people here are redditors
creations-chat 2020-10-31 01:50:13 damn he got that cargo plane ass
creations-chat 2020-11-01 03:20:00 its a mass of purple and wings
creations-chat 2020-11-01 03:21:16 then make something people like
creations-chat 2020-11-01 03:22:19 dont wait for people to change, change yourself (as cheesy as it sounds)
creations-chat 2020-11-01 03:23:20 use downvotes as a way to see what people dislike or like not just for your creation but take a look at other downvoted things and see the relations they share so you can avoid them
creations-chat 2020-11-01 03:28:19 he needs suggestions stop being a snob

<@!618132044253364325> 737 is pretty cool i guess
787-10 is also a new thing coming out i think
creations-chat 2020-11-01 03:30:49 its a suggestion not an assignment, if you drop it no one is gonna care
creations-chat 2020-11-01 03:32:21 because its a suggestion?
creations-chat 2020-11-01 03:34:19 he wanted a suggestion because he was stuck not knowing what to do (problem)
i **helped** him from this situation by giving him suggestion on what some interesting options are (help/solution)
creations-chat 2020-11-01 03:37:31 in the end he found it helpful. i made a simple suggestion because he didnt need complex specifications; only that they needed to be airliners
creations-chat 2020-11-01 03:38:48 ask him if it was helpful then
creations-chat 2020-11-01 03:40:14 if you cant break this down when ive already done it for you im done talking
creations-chat 2020-11-01 03:42:15 he couldnt decide between the options he had; it like sitting in an icecream shop but you cant decide on what flavor to choose
creations-chat 2020-11-01 03:46:11 <@!317833859603496971> read deeper
creations-chat 2020-11-02 03:38:13 waist swivel?
creations-chat 2020-11-02 18:21:05 thats a lot of unneeded motor lock
creations-chat 2020-11-02 20:08:04 the transition from the triangle nose to the square cockpit looks bad
creations-chat 2020-11-02 20:10:56 ive said it before but downvotes could be from how it looks, build qualities, potential, or even just if builld is from a nationality who the downvoter doesnt like
creations-chat 2020-11-02 20:13:44 when is <#504436696021204992> not toxic lmao
creations-chat 2020-11-02 20:53:55 i dont like the transition from the nose to canopy
creations-chat 2020-11-02 20:54:56 pretty amazing. might look crazy if you turn on night setting <@!322926915336011787>

creations-chat 2020-11-06 21:57:34 compress some delta wings to the side
creations-chat 2020-11-11 08:46:04 The maus has the hammer and sickle so that allied spies would assume its a captured soviet design not for avoiding being bombed
creations-chat 2020-11-11 08:47:36 Doesn't make my point any less true
creations-chat 2020-11-11 08:49:08 If they used it in combat it would make it a war crime loool

creations-chat 2020-11-11 17:06:20 Those angles are wrong wings should be like 12Â° and I forgot what the tail was but you can look them up
creations-chat 2020-11-11 17:10:31 23Â° is the back <@393347954305662977>
creations-chat 2020-11-11 17:12:02 Why did you zoom in so much just to circle it lmaooooo
creations-chat 2020-11-11 22:44:55 the top nose is the reworked one. what you guys think?
creations-chat 2020-11-11 23:32:19 minecraft manifold
creations-chat 2020-11-12 07:42:31 what it reminds me of
creations-chat 2020-11-13 18:20:44 dont be put down by a downvote, good to see you arent
creations-chat 2020-11-13 22:49:12 that 15 looks like a bunch of things cobbled together to resemble something of a fat and stubby 15. ifyou were to get pictures of the wing and tail individually i never would have guessed it was even a mig
creations-chat 2020-11-13 23:55:28 if we angle motor lock its never gonna be 100% symetrical right?
creations-chat 2020-11-14 00:48:34 thats a mig 17 lmao
creations-chat 2020-11-14 00:50:09 the photo is a mig 15? nah thats a mig 17 for sure

and giving 1 example is p unconvincing bc it could be a coincidence
creations-chat 2020-11-19 01:56:08 put it in play mode
creations-chat 2020-11-19 01:58:25 a shorter nose
actually nvm the cockpit looks weird tho
creations-chat 2020-11-28 22:19:49 <@!553754576709353494> can i see the back part of your buccaneer?

OH FUCK MB IM TRIPPING
creations-chat 2020-12-01 22:35:46 proportions on that ~~f-8~~ a-6 makes it look like a completely different plane

(missread but still applies)
creations-chat 2020-12-02 17:12:44 looks more like a kpz 70
creations-chat 2020-12-07 17:54:08 <@!621612942076542998> looks nice but that blur hurts my eyes
creations-chat 2020-12-09 01:25:10 <@456226577798135808> more weight in the fuselage lets you turn better
creations-chat 2020-12-09 18:55:57 <@456226577798135808> aint a mig 9 chief
creations-chat 2020-12-09 19:08:19 too blocky imo and unfinished builds are bleh

then expect negative feed back bc most people arent v
creations-chat 2020-12-10 03:35:31 its like looking at speghetti code
creations-chat 2020-12-16 21:13:27 wierd photoshop
creations-chat 2020-12-20 19:13:07 i never saw why it would matter as long as they dont post them in creations channel or claim its theirs
creations-chat 2020-12-20 19:15:36 maybe some people just wanted to have fun? you dont have to learn anything, its a game not hw
creations-chat 2020-12-25 06:26:29 <@!644377285746622494> the V is for era armor anyway, the wt t72b is a t72bv
creations-chat 2021-09-02 18:15:55 <@!490544126606049311> id love to see the frame for the canopy created instead of the glass bubble
creations-chat 2021-09-03 02:26:25 i dont trust angled motor locks to be symetrical enough where is my camera lock
creations-chat 2021-09-03 02:37:54 common â‰  overrated
creations-chat 2021-09-12 21:15:59 <@!401530469952389130> make the cockpit bigger and make the tail a block or 2 longer
creations-chat 2021-10-18 15:44:40 <@456226577798135808> single engine valkyrie lmao
creations-chat 2021-10-22 01:13:18 <@676970337770012683> at that size, the wing panels add too much drag for them to work properly
creations-chat 2021-10-25 05:04:54 the darker blue is ment to be curvy
creations-chat 2021-10-25 18:37:41 maybe if you use 1x4 corner wedges and rotate them 45 degrees
creations-chat 2021-10-25 21:08:54 can i have a different angle?
creations-chat 2021-10-27 06:56:53 <@!615476635558215680> the tail is fat
creations-chat 2021-11-09 16:54:05 You could use half blocks
creations-chat 2021-11-10 08:06:06 Elevator angle is too aggressive
creations-chat 2021-11-10 08:08:07 23Â° for elevator, 12Â° for wing tips
creations-chat 2021-11-10 08:12:42 He could definitely use motor 2 in that situation
creations-chat 2021-11-10 08:14:48 That angle doesn't need to be motor locked as it isn't colliding with anything

Edit: nvm the tail is made differently than what I usually see
creations-chat 2021-11-10 08:20:52 The tail mid section could be made into 2 pieces that are close enough to look like they are touching using motor 2s
creations-chat 2021-11-10 08:22:55 Too bad you couldn't understand it because I have 0 reason to talk to you
creations-chat 2021-11-13 06:49:27 Your car looks autistic
creations-chat 2021-11-19 02:53:03 <@456226577798135808> the canopy should just be blocky since everything else is blocky anyway

if the spine was round like the canopy it might have worked
creations-chat 2021-11-24 23:32:29 think you could make the nose cone a bit bigger?
