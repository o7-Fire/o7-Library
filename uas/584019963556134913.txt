creations-chat 2020-06-13 21:28:45 Don’t worry it will be completely motor control

creations-chat 2020-06-13 21:29:35 Counting its plane crazy...

creations-chat 2020-06-13 21:30:32 Ik but just bulky also I’m making 100% original designs so build a swash plate will take a lot of testing
creations-chat 2020-06-13 23:04:18 Hour 2 has passed on my helicopter progress had to rebuild like 5 times to get it to look as cool as possible and still function
creations-chat 2020-06-13 23:45:04 Yo has anyone made a helicopter that used the back prop to counter the torque and not the double stacked one
creations-chat 2020-06-13 23:45:59 I can’t seem to figure it out when it works the back prop just makes it drift
creations-chat 2020-06-13 23:49:08 Any thoughts on what I can add or improve? Also it has a wobble issue if anyone knows how to fix please tell me
creations-chat 2020-06-13 23:51:15 I don’t know how to build swash plate
